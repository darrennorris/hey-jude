	abstract = {The manipulation of habitat through thinning and logging activities may have cascading effects on fauna because of direct and indirect changes to key habitat features. However, the combined effect of thinning and logging on fauna has not been investigated for Australian forests, despite the widespread use of thinning as a silvicultural management tool in selectively logged forests, and the emerging interest in thinning for biofuels. We therefore surveyed reptiles, birds and key habitat variables at sites selected to sample four management classes reflecting categories of thinning and/or logging activity in cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla forests of the Brigalow Belt bioregion of Australia. Habitat structure and assemblages of reptile and bird species were distinct across the four management classes, reflecting long-term cumulative impacts of small- and/or large-diameter tree removal in a dynamic system, but the response of various functional groups of species was mixed. Recovery of some habitat elements (e.g. small trees) to a state that maintains densities of most fauna species appears to be relatively rapid, but depends on the combined effect of thinning and logging. Other habitat elements, such as large cypress trees which were reduced by logging and unaffected by thinning, require longer time frames to mature and therefore will be critical resources to maintain during future management activities in cypress forests. Overall, it appears that thinning activities affect fauna and therefore must be considered when making decisions about forest management. We suggest management of production forests aims for a mosaic of thinning and/or logging combinations across the landscape, but emphasise the importance of retaining or restoring unthinned and unlogged areas. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {As species of conservation concern, sea turtles have historically been difficult to study because of their elusive nature and extensive ranges, but improvements in telemetry have facilitated insights into life histories and behaviours which can potentially inform conservation policies. To date, there have been few assessments of the impact of satellite tracking data on species conservation, and it is difficult to clearly gauge whether the dividends justify the costs. Through an extensive review of the literature (369 papers, 1982-2014) and a questionnaire-based survey of 171 sea turtle tracking researchers, we evaluate the conservation dividends gained thus far from tracking and highlight conservation successes. We discuss who is tracking and where, where biases in effort exist, and evaluate the impact of tracking data on conservation. Conservation issues are increasingly being considered. Where research recommends policy change, the quality of advice varies and the level of uptake is still uncertain, with few clearly described examples of tracking-data actually influencing policy. The means to increase the conservation impact are discussed, including: disseminating findings more widely; communicating and collaborating with colleagues and stakeholders for more effective data sharing; community liaison, and endeavouring to close the gaps between researchers and conservation practitioners. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Intertidal mussel beds are important for intertidal ecosystems, because they feature a high taxonomic diversity and abundance of benthic organisms and are important foraging grounds for many avian species. After the introduction of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) into the European Wadden Sea, many mussel beds developed into oyster dominated bivalve beds. Despite the fact that oysters have been colonizing many European intertidal areas for about two decades, their impact on the ecosystem is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impact of oysters on the condition of mussels and on the spatial distribution of birds on 18 bivalve beds with different grades of oyster occurrence throughout the Dutch Wadden Sea. Moreover, in comparing bird densities on bivalve beds with densities expected on the total intertidal area, we could detect which species exhibit a preference for the structured habitat. Overall, 50 different bird species were observed on the beds, of which about half regularly frequent intertidal flats. Most of these species showed a preference for bivalve beds. The condition of mussels decreased with the oyster dominance, whereas the majority of bird species was not affected by the oyster occurrence. However, three of the four species that were negatively affected depend on intertidal mussels as food source. Even though the Pacific oyster is a nonnative species, attempts to fight it may do more harm to avian biodiversity than good. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Deforestation and degradation are threatening forests and woodlands globally. The deciduous miombo woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa are no exception, yet little is known about the flora and fauna they contain and the implications of their loss. Butterflies are recognised as indicators of environmental change; however the responses of butterflies in miombo woodlands have received little attention. This paper describes butterfly assemblages and their response to woodland utilisation in an understudied area of miombo woodland in south-west Tanzania. This is an area representative of miombo woodlands throughout sub-Saharan Africa, where woodland is utilised by local communities for a range of products, and is being rapidly converted to agriculture. Baited canopy traps and sweep nets were used to sample frugivorous and nectarivorous butterfly communities at different vertical stratifications in nine different study sites. 104 species were recorded, of which 16 are miombo specialists that have been recorded in Tanzania to the west of the country only. Indicator species were identified for three different levels of utilisation, with species from the sub-family Satyrinae indicating moderate utilisation. Generalised linear mixed effects models showed that butterfly species richness, diversity and abundance all decreased in response to increasing agriculture and anthropogenic utilisation. The loss of miombo woodlands is likely to result in declines in butterfly diversity. However, there was evidence of an intermediate disturbance effect for butterfly species richness, diversity and abundance with one utilisation variable, suggesting that a miombo woodland management plan that allows moderate sustainable utilisation in a heterogeneous landscape of mature miombo woodland and agriculture will simultaneously maintain butterfly communities and enable agricultural production. © 2015 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Cavity-nesting vertebrates are an important component of biodiversity in tropical and subtropical forests, but their persistence will increasingly depend on remnant trees in logged forest and agricultural areas. To identify key habitat features for conservation, we examined the factors that influenced daily nest survival for a community of cavity-nesting birds along a gradient of human impact, from primary Atlantic Forest through logged forest to farms. We used logistic-exposure models to determine how characteristics of the habitat, nest tree, cavity, and timing influenced daily nest survival. Overall, predation and/or usurpation caused 92% of nest failures. Daily survival rates ranged 0.961-0.992 for five species of birds that could be studied best, giving probabilities of 0.19-0.62 of survival from laying to fledging. The top models predicting nest survival included cavity and tree characteristics but no habitat variables (canopy cover, forest condition, or distance to forest edge). Small birds (12-128. g) experienced higher nest survival in cavities with smaller entrance diameters, higher above the ground. Large birds (141-400. g) experienced higher nest survival in living trees than in dead trees. Birds experienced similar nest survival in primary forest, logged forest, and farms. Our results highlight the conservation value of cavity-bearing trees in anthropogenic habitats. A pressing policy issue for tropical and subtropical forests is to move beyond minimum diameter cutting limits and instead focus on retention of large old trees. © 2015.},

	abstract = {The transition from natural habitat to agricultural land use is widely regarded as one of the leading drivers of biodiversity loss. Despite this, most wildlife still lives outside protected areas on private agricultural land, particularly on rangeland used for livestock grazing. Understanding which species persist and which decline in agricultural landscapes is important for global biodiversity monitoring, management and conservation. In this study, we used hierarchical multi-species occupancy modelling to estimate terrestrial vertebrate (body mass > 0.5 kg) richness in the Karoo, a semi-arid region of South Africa. We evaluated species-specific responses to different anthropogenic and environmental variables in rangeland and a nearby protected area of similar size. We grouped mammal species according to trophic guild and body size and compared their occurrence between areas. In total we detected 42 species over 4035 6-day pooled trap nights across 322 sites. Community species richness was not significantly different between the two types of land use and decreased with increasing elevation in the protected area. Human disturbance did not affect individual species occupancy in either area. Carnivores, omnivores and medium-sized species occupancy probabilities were similar between the two areas but were higher for herbivores and large species in the protected area and for insectivores and small species in rangeland. Our results reveal that drylands in the South African Karoo region, including rangeland used for small-livestock farming, support a diverse community of terrestrial vertebrates. Private landowners are thus important custodians of key components of indigenous biodiversity outside of protected areas, especially in low-lying areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The United States' Endangered Species Act (ESA) is the world's foremost law for protecting species at risk of extinction; however, species must first be listed as threatened or endangered before receiving protection under the Act. We used an information theoretic approach to assess whether listing budget, policy phase (which was correlated with presidential administration), or both factors were associated with the number of species listed annually between 1983 and 2014. Annual listing rates were positively affected by larger listing budgets; policy phase also had a significant impact on annual listing rates after accounting for the effects of budget. However, the listing process for any one species spans multiple years, thus we also evaluated how taxonomic affiliation, the initiating organization, and lawsuits affected the amount of time 1338 listed species spent in review between 1973 and 2014. Species waited a median of 12.1 years to receive protection, with plants and invertebrates experiencing longer wait times than vertebrates. These process times exceed ESA deadlines, which are two years when initiated from a third party; this may perpetuate population declines and hinder recovery efforts. We observed that at the time of a lawsuit filling for either a proposed or final rule, species had waited, respectively, 4.19 and 0.70 years longer than species for which no lawsuits were filed, indicating lawsuits targeted species that experienced longer delays. We discuss how changes in ESA implementation over time interacted to produce high variability and often long wait times in the listing process. Our results indicated a positive role for both citizen petitions and budget increases to advance the listing process, thus hastening biodiversity protection. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Monitoring of threatened species is a critical part of conserving biodiversity. It is needed to understand population trajectories, threatening processes, and the type and effectiveness of management responses needed to ensure persistence and recovery. Characteristics of some plant species (e.g. immobility) should render them amenable to monitoring, whereas other characteristics (e.g. ephemeral life histories) will make plant monitoring challenging. We evaluated monitoring adequacy and extent for a large sample (839 taxa) of Australia's threatened plants (1336 taxa) and compared this assessment with a similar evaluation for threatened vertebrates. We found 37.2% of threatened plants are monitored, half the rate found for vertebrates. For monitored plants, monitoring quality as assessed using a set of nine criteria was generally low, similar to results for vertebrates. Plants with more imperilled conservation status were more likely to be monitored and tended to have higher quality monitoring. Plants with recovery plans were more likely to be monitored than those without. The likelihood a species was monitored decreased the longer a taxon had been listed under threatened species legislation. Monitoring longevity was poor but inclusion of demographic data and linkages to management were better than for vertebrates. Our assessment highlighted a lack of collated monitoring data for plants, and we recognise there are exemplary programs for threatened plants that can guide improvements in monitoring for other species. Plants are overwhelmingly represented in threatened species lists worldwide and a determined focus to improve the extent and quality of plant monitoring should underpin biodiversity conservation targets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Bushmeat hunting is among the principal threats to larger-bodied vertebrate species, such as primates, in central Africa. However, species vary in their response to differing levels of hunting intensity, making it difficult to not only quantify the effect hunting has on wild populations, but also to plan for effective conservation interventions. In order to investigate the impact of hunting on primates on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, we collected data on primate abundance and hunting intensity across three areas in the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve (GCSR) via reconnaissance surveys. We assessed how the relative abundance and proportional representation of Bioko's seven diurnal primate species varied among the different sites and in relation to hunting intensity. Overall primate species richness and abundance were highest in areas where gun hunting was minimal, but both measures declined with increasing evidence of gun hunting. Two species of primates, Cercopithecus erythrotis and Cercopithecus nictitans, were relatively tolerant of heavy hunting, but all other species were considered vulnerable. Procolobus pennantii, a species endemic to Bioko, exhibited the highest vulnerability, and its range appears restricted to a very limited area in the southwest of the GCSR. Our analyses indicate that hunting on Bioko is a strong contributor to current patterns of primate abundance and diversity, and suggest that hunting may be driving Bioko's most threatened primates (e.g., P. pennantii) towards extinction. These results highlight the need for rapid intervention on Bioko in order to safeguard the future of its unique primates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Hunting with snares is indiscriminate and wasteful, and this practice is currently one of the gravest threats to terrestrial vertebrates in the tropics. However, as snares are difficult to detect and often dispersed widely across large, inaccessible areas it is problematic to reliably estimate their prevalence and no standard survey methods exist. Conservation managers need reliable, timely, information on the spatio-temporal patterns of hunting and on responses to interventions, and we present an innovative sampling and analysis framework that allows for the rigorous estimation of snare detectability and ‘abundance’, but which can be feasibly implemented in challenging field contexts. This new approach was used to undertake a large-scale systematic snare survey in Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, in Eastern Cambodia, and the resulting data were analysed using a novel application of N-mixture models. A range of environmental and management factors were examined as potential determinants of snare abundance and detectability, and proximity to the Vietnamese border was shown to be overwhelmingly the most influential factor. Snares were more common in the wet season rather than the dry season, and the detection probability of snares was shown to be low (~ 0.33), as predicted. No clear relationships between snaring levels, anti-poaching patrol effort and ungulate densities were evident from these data. There was clear evidence that certain factors, such as the percentage of dense forest cover, will exert confounding effects on both detectability and abundance, highlighting the critical need to take account of the imperfect detection when designing threat monitoring systems. © 2017},

	abstract = {Even though bogs function as the most important terrestrial carbon store on Earth and play a crucial role in the conservation of highly endangered species, the area covered by peatlands is declining globally. Consequently, numerous restoration efforts within degraded bogs have been realized. In many cases, however, it is unknown whether the conservation measures have been successful. We used Odonata (hereafter referred to as dragonflies) as ecological indicators to evaluate the restoration success of rewetting measures in central European degraded raised bogs. Depending on their land-use history (rewetted industrial peat cuts with and without former agricultural use), two types of bog restoration were compared with rural peat cuts (control). Our study demonstrated that restored bogs are important habitats for dragonfly conservation. Both types of restored bogs were as diverse in overall species richness as the control plots. However, land-use history had a strong effect on restoration success. All raised-bog species of the study area were able to recolonize at least some of the nutrient-poor restored bogs. The situation was different for the nutrient-rich restored bogs. Due to the high nutrient content – caused by the former agricultural use – the characteristic dragonfly fauna of raised bogs will be unlikely to be able to recolonize in these locations in the long term. Nevertheless, the nutrient-rich restored bogs represent an important secondary habitat, especially for transition-bog species. In conclusion, the conducted restoration measures created a network of small oligo- to mesotrophic water bodies, which fosters aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity in bogs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that distribution of Neotropical seasonally dry forests (NSDFs) and the survival of the species and communities that inhabit them have been negatively affected by land-use modifications and global climate change (GCC). Protected Areas (PAs) in the region are inefficient and insufficient, and these human-driven threats are expected to further diminish their effectiveness. Research on the long-term effectiveness of these areas for NSDFs protection is therefore a high priority. Here, using birds as a study group, we combined both species distribution modelling and systematic conservation planning techniques to delineate priority areas where species are predicted to persist into the 2050's in the face of GCC and land conversion across the NSDFs distribution. These analyses showed an imperative need to improve the performance of PAs, which covered only ~11% of the NSDFs area and included on average just 13% of species' remaining distributions in the 2050's. The most important opportunity for improving NSDFs conservation status is provided by protecting ~6% more surface area, which could increase the level of protection in the near future: 24.8–28.2% of species distributions on average and 36.9–39.5% for those threatened and Data Deficit species. Besides, 21.6% for these proposed areas coincide with areas currently defined as priority for NSDFs, and 22.8% coincides with priority areas for conservation and research of terrestrial vertebrates. The priority areas identified are mainly distributed in Mexico (70.8%). Our findings pinpoint major opportunities for efficient conservation planning in the region, if there is political will to do so. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Most countries have committed to protect 17% of their terrestrial area by 2020 through Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, with a focus on protecting areas of particular importance for biodiversity. This means national-scale spatial conservation prioritisations are needed to help meet this target and guide broader conservation and land-use policy development. However, to ensure these assessments are adopted by policy makers, they must also consider national priorities. This situation is exemplified by Guyana, a corner of Amazonia that couples high biodiversity with low economic development. In recent years activities that threaten biodiversity conservation have increased, and consequently, protected areas are evermore critical to achieving the Aichi targets. Here we undertake a cost-effective approach to protected area planning in Guyana that accounts for domestic conditions. To do this we conducted a stakeholder-led spatial conservation prioritisation based on meeting targets for 17 vegetation types and 329 vertebrate species, while minimising opportunity costs for forestry, mining, agriculture and urbanisation. Our analysis identifies 3 million ha of priority areas for conservation, helping inform government plans to double the current protected area network from 8.5 to 17%. As part of this, we also develop a new technique to prioritise engagement with local communities whose lands are identified as important to conservation. Our study both provides a scientific, politically acceptable protected area expansion strategy for Guyana, and illustrates the importance of conservation planning at the country-scale to translate international commitments into national action. © 2017},

	abstract = {Military training areas (MTAs) cover 6% of the earth's land surface, but the impact on biodiversity of weapons use in MTAs remains largely unknown. We quantified the effects of military training on vertebrates in a 5-year study at Beecroft Weapons Range in south-eastern Australia by contrasting the occurrence of birds, mammals and reptiles between 24 sites within an area subject to repeated weapons use and a matched set of non-impacted sites. Species richness of mammals and reptiles was similar within versus outside the impact area, although many individual species responded to fire, which occurred more frequently in impacted sites. Bird species richness, the occurrence of larger-bodied and migratory bird species, and the occurrence of most individual bird species, was reduced within the impact area. Many bird species that displayed low prevalence in impacted sites also declined over time across the whole study area. Differences in biota between the impact and non-impact areas were detectable after controlling for the effects of recent fire, suggesting that weapons use impacted vertebrates through mechanisms additional to altered fire regimes. Overall, our data indicated that Beecroft Weapons Range maintained considerable biodiversity value despite prolonged military use. Hence, MTAs have the potential to make a substantial contribution to conservation outside the formal protected area network. However, managers of MTAs need to explicitly state their environmental objectives. This is because management practices may be different if the aim is to maximize species richness rather than to secure populations of particular species. © 2016},

	abstract = {Assessments of biodiversity patterns and threats among African reptiles have lagged behind those of other vertebrate groups and regions. We report the first systematic assessment of the distribution, threat status, and climate change vulnerability for the reptiles of Tanzania. A total of 321 reptile species (including 90 Tanzanian endemics) were assessed using the global standard IUCN Red List methodology and 274 species were also assessed using the IUCN guidelines for climate change vulnerability. Patterns of species richness and threat assessment confirm the conservation importance of the Eastern Arc Mountains, as previously demonstrated for birds, mammals and amphibians. Lowland forests and savannah-woodland habitats also support important reptile assemblages. Protected area gap analysis shows that 116 species have less than 20% of their distribution ranges protected, among which 12 are unprotected, eight species are threatened and 54 are vulnerable to climate change. Tanzania's northern margins and drier central corridor support high numbers of climate vulnerable reptile species, together with the eastern African coastal forests and the region between Lake Victoria and Rwanda. This paper fills a major gap in our understanding of the distribution and threats facing Tanzania's reptiles, and demonstrates more broadly that the explicit integration of climate change vulnerability in Red Listing criteria may revise spatial priorities for conservation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Carbon offset funds provide substantial opportunities for protection and restoration of native ecosystems, with corresponding gains for biodiversity and reductions in atmospheric carbon. However, biodiversity could be disadvantaged if not properly accounted for, particularly under climate change, where high carbon gains do not coincide spatially with biodiversity priorities. While globally there is congruence for species richness and carbon stocks, adequate conservation needs to incorporate more refined measures of biodiversity – and consideration of the impact of future climate change. We investigated the spatial trade-off for carbon and biodiversity priorities in north-eastern Australia based on current and projected climate, using the Zonation prioritisation software. By iteratively weighting carbon against biodiversity we found that prioritising land based on biodiversity value (for 697 vertebrates) included priority areas for potential carbon sequestration (Maximum Potential Biomass). However, if prioritisation was based on carbon sequestration potential alone, substantial areas important for biodiversity would be lost. Policy frameworks need to be strengthened to remove barriers from landholder participation in carbon storage projects that have biodiversity benefits, and to require that both carbon and biodiversity gains are additional. Properly accounting for biodiversity in land-based carbon sequestration and storage prioritisation in this region is likely to generate substantial benefits for both biodiversity and carbon. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Introduced predators have been implicated in the decline of many fauna populations around the world and are the main factor responsible for the failure of numerous fauna reintroduction programs. As a result, control of introduced predators is a significant management action implemented in wildlife protection programs, particularly in Australia, New Zealand and on islands. Individual predators are seldom targeted in conservation programs, which usually conduct broad-scale, non-specific predator control based on the assumption that the removal of each individual predator is equally important. In contrast, predator management programs initiated by human-wildlife conflict typically use profiling or specific control techniques to target 'problem' predators. We investigated whether individual domestic cats vary in the magnitude of their predation threat to wildlife by first reviewing published and anecdotal information on incidences where feral cats have had significant impacts on wildlife protection or translocation programs. We concentrated on prey species that were likely to be more challenging to cats based on their size, novelty or behavior. We then used the results from this review to create a profile of cats that were most likely to cause significant problems for challenging prey, and tested this during a translocation of a threatened mammal species. Both the review and translocation suggested that large male cats 3.5. kg or heavier were disproportionally responsible for predation events on challenging prey and possibly implicated in the failure of many protection or reintroduction programs of mammals greater than 1. kg. Some cats within this demographic profile were responsible for multiple prey deaths suggesting that both demography and prior experience may define predators capable of 'catastrophic predation' that threatens prey populations.Current control programs for feral cats and foxes that do not target particular predator profiles may inadvertently avoid controlling individuals most likely to specialize on threatened prey. We call for the application of crime-fighting forensic and aggregate profiling techniques in wildlife protection programs to determine the profile of predators likely to prey on focal wildlife species and to guide the development of control methods that specifically target these individuals. © 2015.},

	abstract = {Replacement of complex assemblages of native mammal fauna with livestock species reduces niche heterogeneity. This negatively affects taxa such as dung beetles, which depend on them and can, in turn, affect ecosystem functioning. We assessed the response of dung beetle diversity, biomass and body condition to cattle-farming pressures in protected areas (PAs) and adjacent farms in the savannah biome of northern Namibia. We hypothesized that rich native mammal assemblages are essential to maintain dung beetle diversity and overall biomass. We further explored whether the low-quality dung resources on farms would lead to a decrease in individual body size for species found on both farms and PAs. Overall dung beetle richness increased with higher mammal richness but not relative abundance, demonstrating that a rich native vertebrate assemblage promotes dung beetle richness. Overall dung beetle biomass was lower on farms, but abundance showed no difference. Large-bodied dung specialist species, which are known to be functionally superior, were absent on farms while smaller generalist species proliferated. Furthermore, a large proportion of individuals of species common to both farms and PAs were physically smaller on farms, indicating reduced body condition. Our results show that a high diversity of native mammals maintains dung beetle diversity and higher biomass on PAs. A decrease in native dung on farms leads to reduced body mass, likely negatively impacting ecological function. These results suggest that the conservation of dung beetles and their functions in the expansive African savannah ecosystems is dependent on a complex mix of native mammal species. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Carrion promotes biodiversity and ecosystem stability, and large carnivores provide this resource throughout the year. In particular, apex felids subordinate to other carnivores contribute more carrion to ecological communities than other predators. We measured vertebrate scavenger diversity at puma (Puma concolor) kills in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and utilized a model-comparison approach to determine what variables influenced scavenger diversity (Shannon's H) at carcasses. We documented the highest vertebrate scavenger diversity of any study to date (39 birds and mammals). Scavengers represented 10.9% of local birds and 28.3% of local mammals, emphasizing the diversity of food-web vectors supported by pumas, and the positive contributions of pumas and potentially other subordinate, apex felids to ecological stability. Scavenger diversity at carcasses was most influenced by the length of time the carcass was sampled, and the biological variables, temperature and prey weight. Nevertheless, diversity was relatively consistent across carcasses. We also identified six additional stalk-and-ambush carnivores weighing > 20 kg, that feed on prey larger than themselves, and are subordinate to other predators. Together with pumas, these seven felids may provide distinctive ecological functions through their disproportionate production of carrion and subsequent contributions to biodiversity. We urge conservation managers to increase support for these species, as a means of prioritizing resources to best ensure the persistence of carrion in natural systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

All ca. 29,000 orchid species are listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and many are protected under domestic legislation too, but a growing body of evidence suggests that orchids continue to be subject to unsustainable harvesting and undocumented trade. South China is a known black spot for trade in wild-collected ornamental orchids but understanding of the drivers determining the flow of species diversity, volume and value remains wanting. We conducted systematic monthly surveys at five markets along a West-East transect from Yunnan to Hong Kong for one year, recording variables including species, numbers of individuals, weight and price. Although wild orchid diversity is highest in Yunnan, the diversity of orchids in trade increased eastwards and mean price per stem rose more than four-fold, albeit always significantly cheaper than that for artificially produced hybrids. Part of this trade appears to be in breach of CITES. Few orchids in trade conformed to six criteria highlighted in prior demand-side studies as being of higher utility value, but most conformed to a combination of four or more, suggesting that vendors can readily offer products that meet a majority of consumer preferences. Effective supply-side regulation, through government intervention and social media campaigns, is needed to facilitate behavioural change and allow artificially propagated plants to compete in the market-place. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Although tropical forests are among the most species-rich ecosystems on earth, 42% of mammal species in tropical forests are endangered because of overhunting and/or unsustainable exploitation. Camera-trap surveys have shown that natural saltlicks can be used to determine mammalian fauna, especially medium to large endangered species in tropical forests; establishment of camera traps, however, is time and effort intensive. Furthermore, the photographic range and detectable size of species are often restricted. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a powerful approach that might provide a better way to study terrestrial animals in tropical forests. In this study, we examined whether eDNA from natural saltlicks comprehensively represented species composition in a Bornean tropical forest. We collected 100–150-mL water samples from natural saltlicks in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We constructed amplicon libraries for MiSeq sequencing using eDNA extracted from the water samples. Six endangered species were detected using this method, including Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), Bornean banteng (Bos javanicus lowi), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica), sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) and bearded pig (Sus barbatus). However, most small and minor species were not detected, with low sequence identity (80–96%). Therefore, we propose that more species of tropical forest mammals should have their sequences deposited in DNA databases.

	abstract = {A buffer zone can be defined as the surroundings of a protected area, restricting human activities, such as irregular urban growth, hunting, logging, and unsustainable agriculture. The general objective of this research was to propose a methodology for the delimitation of a buffer zone surrounding a conservation unit within the Atlantic Forest Biome, integrating physical, biotic and socioeconomic aspects with the use of map algebra and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique. The study area, Rio Canoas State Park, is a unit of integral protection type conservation containing araucaria forest, which is of great environmental relevance as it is situated in the Atlantic Forest Biome containing several species of wild fauna and flora. Firstly, natural vulnerability to erosion of the surroundings of the park associated with basic territorial units with the aid of map algebra and AHP technique was elaborated. Secondly, insertion of special areas such as permanent preservation areas and areas consolidated by the Ministry of the Environment in the buffer zone was done. Finally, the buffer zone of the park delimited from the results acquired in the previous two stages was established. It was verified that the calculation of natural vulnerability to erosion and the parameters of special areas were effective and adequate for the delimitation of the buffer zone with a total area of approximately 37,888 ha. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of buffer zone delimitation using remote sensing and GIS techniques based on environmental conditions, including the invasion of exotic species, of the surrounding areas of the conservation units. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate change is likely to shift the distributions of ecosystems worldwide. Most assessments of climate change are primarily species-focused and do not directly estimate how entire ecosystems may change. Using an ecosystem-based modelling approach, we provide a region-wide climate change vulnerability assessment of the seven major ecosystems across Africa's Albertine Rift. The Albertine Rift is a global biodiversity hotspot, containing more endemic vertebrates than anywhere else in Africa. We used Maxent to estimate each ecosystem's extent using current climate data, then we projected the potential distribution of each ecosystem for 2050 and 2070. We found that suitable conditions for most ecosystems are predicted to contract rapidly in extent and shift upwards in altitude. High-altitude ecosystems and the endemic species they support are at immediate risk, owing to rapid predicted shrinkage in their suitable extent. Only the Combretum-grasslands savannah ecosystem is predicted to expand, with suitable conditions increasing by 32% in area by 2050. The extent and structure of boundary zones between the Rift's ecosystems may change significantly through time, due to the contractions and shifts of the environmental conditions for existing ecosystem distributions. By 2070, 44% of the region could be climatically unsuitable for the current ecosystems. Conservation planning across the Rift will need to account for these ecosystem shifts and rapidly changing boundary zones to ensure the long-term persistence of the many endemic species. Beyond the Albertine Rift, this ecosystem-based modelling technique can be adapted to any terrestrial region, providing critical information for conservation vulnerability assessments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

These include tropical coral reefs, seagrass meadows, rhodolith beds, kelp and mangrove forests as well as deep-sea coral reefs, sponge gardens and hydrothermal vents. The contributions of coral reefs, mangrove forests and seagrass meadows are well recognised as important components of tropical marine seascapes. In temperate regions, hotspots of primary productivity such as kelp forests, and vegetation-based ecosystems found at coastal margins play significant roles in nutrient and sediment trapping and coastal protection. Biogenic features in coastal regions can also play important roles, including shellfish reefs, sponge gardens and macroalgal mats that provide physical structure within soft sediment ecosystems. Similar biogenic features are found in the deep sea, which often occur associated with seamounts, canyon features, cold seeps and hydrothermal vents. Many marine small natural features are globally threatened as they are found at the interface with human-influenced landscapes (coastal ecosystems) or are the focus of resource exploitation (e.g., trawling for fish associated with seamounts and canyons). Challenges in management are, however, consistent across depths, and highlight the restricted spatial extent of such features, and the limited information typically available on their distributions, and the ecosystem services they provide. Numerous strategies can be utilized to sustainably manage, protect, create and restore these marine small natural features and their associated biodiversity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

However, protected areas are not always located such that their positive impacts over biodiversity are maximized. This drawback is especially significant and uncontrolled when intense climate-change dynamics stresses local biodiversity equilibrium. This study aims to weight plausible evolutive scenarios (up to 2040) of PA-effectiveness to secure the most suitable climates for 94 vertebrate species in Central Mexico, a region that, historically, has faced large biodiversity turnover rates. Effectiveness was appraised at two scales. For a set of species, effectiveness expresses the spatial matching of established protected areas (ePAs) with top priority areas (T17) obtained from an optmised area-selection protocol. For each single species, effectiveness relates the predicted trends of climate suitable areas within ePAs/T17 with trends outside ePAs/T17. Results show that aprox.54% of ePAs area occur within T17 and species present variable responses, with suitability gains up to 10% and potential climate suitability losses of aprox.30% within ePAs. A considerable high amount of T17 (aprox.74%) is left unprotected. By assuming the high-valued component of past conservation efforts, this study delivers a double-guidance for planners and decision-makers. First, it pinpoints the ePAs that will demand further conservation investments in the upcoming years. Second, it identifies the unprotected regions where most active conservation actions are needed to supplement ePAs for a climate-effective protected area network. The framework here-proposed gives decision-makers the means to undertake effective and robust decisions in a dynamic and uncertain world. © 2021},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to be an important tool providing low-cost but sufficiently precise mapping products to support environmental management. In this study, we present possible applications of UAVs to map and monitor three representative coastal tropical habitats: mangroves, rocky shores and coral reefs. We conducted UAVs surveys in a Marine Protected Area (MPA) of the tropical eastern Pacific region to investigate the suitability and usefulness of using this tool in a remote area for a variety of management and monitoring purposes. For mangrove ecosystems, we evaluated the potential of UAV-derived data to estimate canopy cover. On an intertidal rocky shore, we evaluated the potential of UAVs to obtain a detailed relative topographic position index that can be used to correlate the distribution patterns of resident and transient fauna. Finally, we compared the standard diver-based coral reef mapping approach used at the MPA with the use of a map produced with the UAV. Our results suggest that the use of UAVs by conservation practitioners in MPAs with diverse habitats, such as in the tropics, is likely to improve the knowledge of the MPAs environments and provide highly detailed information for monitoring helping to understand the nursery function of these inter-connected tropical habitats, at a reduced cost. This tool, therefore, has the potential to support conservation measures in a more effective way. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Tropical dry islands are currently facing major challenges derived from anthropogenic and climatic pressures. However, their trajectories of environmental change, which could provide relevant information applicable to biodiversity conservation, remain understudied. This is mainly due to poor micro-fossil preservation and irregular sediment deposition. Multi-proxy palaeoecological analyses spanning decades to 1000s of years can add perspective as to how vegetation, fungal communities, and the fauna responded to previous natural and anthropogenic disturbances. In São Nicolau, Cabo Verde, we used palaeoecological methods to analyse a highland soil profile (1000 m asl) dated to 5900 cal yr BP. We analysed how vegetation (abundances in pollen of native and introduced species, and leaf wax n-alkanes), ferns and fungal communities (abundance of non-pollen palynomorphs) varied over time in relation to fire (charcoal concentration) and erosion regimes (grain sizes and elemental composition). Between 5000 and 400 cal yr BP the highlands held native woody taxa such as Euphorbia tuckeyana, Dracaena draco subsp. caboverdeana, and Ficus, taxa that can be used for future reforestation programmes. From 400 cal yr BP to the present day, replacement of native taxa by introduced and cultivated taxa (Pinus, Eucalyptus, Asystasia, Opuntia) has occurred. Vegetation burning and grazing caused loss of vegetation and erosion, acting as conjoined drivers of scrubland degradation. This dataset helps to set historically contextualised restoration goals such as the re-introduction of native species, monitoring of recently introduced species and control of free grazing. This can serve as a model system for the conservation of tropical dry islands' biodiversity. © 2019},

	abstract = {The measurable impacts of small-scale fisheries on coastal marine ecosystems and vulnerable megafauna species (elasmobranchs, marine mammals and sea turtles) within them are largely unknown, particularly in developing countries. This study assesses megafauna catch and composition in handline, longline, bottom-set and drift gillnet fisheries of the southwestern Indian Ocean. Observers monitored 21 landing sites across Kenya, Zanzibar and northern Madagascar for 12 months in 2016–17. Landings (n = 4666) identified 59 species, including three sea turtles, two small cetaceans and one sirenian (Dugong dugon). Primary gear threats to investigated taxa were identified as bottom-set gillnets (marine mammals, sea turtles and batoids), drift gillnets (marine mammals, batoids and sharks) and longlines (sharks). Overall, catch was dominated by small and moderately sized coastal requiem sharks (Carcharhiniformes) and whiprays (Dasyatidae). Larger coastal and oceanic elasmobranchs were also recorded in substantial numbers as were a number of deeper-water species. The diversity of catch demonstrates the potential for small-scale fisheries to have impacts across a number of ecosystems. From the observed catch rates we calculated annual regional elasmobranch landings to be 35,445 (95%CI 30,478–40,412) tonnes, 72.6% more than officially reported in 2016 and 129.2% more than the 10-year average (2006–16), constituting 2.48 (95%CI 2.20–2.66) million individuals. Productivity-Susceptibility Analyses indicate that small and moderately sized elasmobranchs are most vulnerable in the small-scale fisheries. The study demonstrates substantial underreporting of catches in small-scale fisheries and highlights the need to expand efforts globally to assess the extent and impact of small-scale fisheries on vulnerable marine species and their respective ecosystems. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {Hunting has reduced or eliminated large-bodied vertebrates in many areas across the tropics, contributing to the global process of defaunation. Elucidating the ecological consequences of hunting has important implications for managing ecosystems and for our understanding of community and ecosystem ecology. We present data collected through a combination of comparative and experimental approaches to assess how faunally-intact and heavily-hunted forests in Gabon differ in understory vegetation structure, macroinvertebrate fauna, ecological processes, and the relative importance of different taxa driving those processes. Our results show that hunted sites had denser understory vegetation and hosted approximately 170 times fewer termites compared to faunally-intact sites. While web-building spiders were positively associated with understory vegetation density, this effect did not translate to significantly higher abundances in heavily-hunted forests. Additionally, the overall rates of decomposition, insectivory, and seed predation/removal on the forest floor appeared robust to both defaunation and the associated increases in understory vegetation density. However, our exclosure experiments revealed that the contribution of invertebrates to decomposition was approximately 25% lower in hunted sites compared to faunally-intact sites. Results suggest potential resilience in this complex ecosystem such that microbial or other taxa not measured in this study may compensate for the reduced functional contribution of invertebrates to decomposition. However, while our results illustrate potential resilience, they also indicate that indirect effects following defaunation, such as increases in the density of understory vegetation, may alter invertebrate communities on the forest floor, with potential consequences for the mechanisms, and therefore the dynamics, driving critical ecosystem processes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The persistence of tropical rainforests, together with their flora and fauna, is highly threatened by anthropogenic disturbances. In this study, we investigate to what extent selective logging influences the structure and composition of a tropical rainforest in Madagascar and subsequently lemur encounter rates and cluster sizes. We quantified forest structure variables and conducted transect surveys of seven sympatric diurnal lemur species in five protected forest sites with different logging histories. We found that DBH, tree height, the interquartile ranges of DBH and tree height (measure of forest heterogeneity), tree species and family richness were relatively high and tree density was relatively low in less disturbed compared to disturbed sites. Although the disturbed forests have not fully recovered to previous conditions, they seem to have recovered from a functional perspective into suitable lemur habitat, as lemur encounter rates and cluster sizes were similar in disturbed and less disturbed sites. We only found slightly higher encounter rates for Varecia variegata (P = 0.078) and lower encounter rates for Eulemur rufifrons (P = 0.059) in less disturbed forests. This is one of the first studies that report the presence of V. variegata, a species characterised by its drastic decline, in previously logged sites. Lemurs travelling between disturbed and less disturbed sites disperse seeds and hereby facilitate forest regeneration. Therefore, we promote the need for better attention to the value of logged forests for biodiversity conservation in Madagascar and suggest that there is considerable potential for regenerating logged forests to support lemur communities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Adequate levels of genetic diversity are important for the long-term success of translocated populations. Typically, population genetic theory and mathematical models are used to inform expected outcomes in different contexts. However, difficulties arise when trying to translate theoretical expectations into management actions. Providing practical guidelines on how to maximise the genetic diversity of translocated populations will help bridge this gap. In this study we develop guidelines for genetic management in translocation programs that consider genetic dynamics associated with population establishment, the harvest of founders from a source population, and the supplementation of an existing population over eight generations. Guidelines were informed by individual-based modelling. Given the nature of the modelling framework that we adopted, we report results in terms of the actual number of individuals and genetic diversity parameters as these are estimated in field-based studies. Our results demonstrate that 10 releases of 50 or two releases of 100 individuals should be carried out to establish a new population. Repeated harvests (each) of >30% of a source population within a generation had a negative impact on its genetic diversity and demographics. The survival of >20% of the supplemented individuals was needed for the supplementation program to be effective. Concurrently, the survival of resident animals also had a major effect. We make available a R utility to explore potential outcomes under different management scenarios. We considered our results to be directly applicable to polygamous, continuous breeder species, and generally informative for a wide range of vertebrate species. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Worldwide, bees have an important role in ecosystem function and the provision of ecosystem services through their role as pollinators. The diversity of bee species in rural landscapes is influenced by the type of landscape features present, and by land-use and management practices. A key challenge is to understand and predict how species vary across the landscape; and the role of functional traits in determining compositional patterns. We systematically sampled wild bees in four types of landscape feature – open farmland, scattered farmland trees, roadside vegetation and streamside vegetation – in rural landscapes in southern Australia. Landscapes were selected to represent wooded or non-wooded combinations of these site types (e.g. roadside vegetation with or without trees), embedded in farmland with different land-uses (e.g. cropping, grazing). The species richness and abundance of bees was greater at sites containing little or no tree cover; and the cumulative richness of species was greater for tree-less sites than for those with trees. In contrast, species evenness was greatest in wooded site types, indicating these were less dominated by abundant generalist species. Open farmland and treeless roadsides had greater functional diversity (based on species traits) than wooded site types. Strong species trait associations were more numerous with open parts of the landscape, reflecting the greater functional diversity of open site types. These results suggest that a suite of the extant bee fauna can exploit large-scale transformation from former extensively wooded ecosystems to open agricultural landscapes. However, not all species are able to exploit modified landscapes and may disappear with further loss of wooded vegetation. Trait-based approaches provide insight into how changes in landscape pattern affect the bee fauna. Failure to adequately cater for multiple functional groups of bees across all landscape features could mean a substantial loss in species that rely on more natural cover, thus affecting ecosystem function. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

We evaluated how avian diversity responded to plantation- and landscape-level environmental variables. The most parsimonious model at the plot scale contained inter-tree planting distance for rubber, plantation age, and inverse distance weight of forest as predictors. The most supported model at the landscape scale contained both distance to forest patches larger than 100 ha and natural forest area as predictors. Model predictions indicated that natural forest area had the largest contribution to bird richness at landscape levels; avian diversity was projected to more than double when natural forest area increased from 25% to 75%. Frugivores and insectivores exhibited the strongest response to gains in natural forest area. Our results indicated that plantation smallholders could achieve biodiversity gains by retaining older trees and planting rubber trees with larger gaps, but that the most critical intervention is retaining large natural forest patches. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The concept of National responsibility species (NRS) was developed to coordinate the conservation efforts of species occurring in multiple countries. Calculated as the fraction of the global species' distribution within a country, it measures the contribution of a local population to global survival of the species. However, there may be more co-occurring species in one region than another, making the conservation of a species more cost-efficient in the first than the latter. If cost-efficient resource allocation is the goal, then identifying NRS should also be based on spatial priorities. We propose that a species is considered NRS when a large part of its distribution falls within high priority areas in a country. We identify NRS from spatial conservation prioritization outputs to (1) maximize the overall cost-efficiency of allocation of conservation resources and (2) to provide information about which species the spatial priorities are based on. We analyzed data on vertebrates in the Birds and Habitats directives in the EU28 countries and compared the traditional NRS measure to three alternative strategies. While the majority of species maintained their NRS status in most countries regardless of the approach, differences occurred, with varying numbers and identities of responsibility species in a country, or responsibilities for species shifting between countries. The differences were largest in geographically marginal countries and for species that were distributed across a few countries. Other NRS approaches may also be useful, and the choice of approach should ultimately depend on the purpose and complement information on conservation status in decision-making. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Reintroductions offer a powerful tool to reverse adverse anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity by restoring extirpated populations within the indigenous range of species. Reintroductions have become popular and have been increasingly used over the last decades. However, this species-centred conservation approach has been criticized for being taxonomically biased and for focusing on large and charismatic species. Studies investigating taxonomic biases in the allocation of reintroduction efforts at large scale generally consider taxonomic bias within and among higher taxa (e.g. vertebrates, plants), by comparing the number of reintroduced species within a taxon to its prevalence in nature. Here, we show that the bias is even more striking when accounting for the differences in the number of implemented programs among reintroduced species. We conducted a comprehensive search of the peer-reviewed and grey literature to inventory reintroduction programs of European terrestrial mammals. We identified 28 species that have been reintroduced at least one time. For each reintroduced mammal, we extensively searched two literature search engines and found 414 relevant publications, which described 375 distinguishable reintroduction programs implemented in Europe from the early 20th century to 2013. We used the number of implemented programs and the number of associated publications to investigate the distribution of reintroduction efforts among species. Our results show a substantial heterogeneity in the allocation of reintroduction efforts, with 68% of implemented reintroductions in Europe involving only three species: the beaver (Castor fiber), the Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) and the European bison (Bison bonasus). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Feral cats (Felis catus) are one of the most successful and harmful invasive predator species, leading to dramatic loss of biodiversity across the globe. Our study assessed feral cat predation in a major biodiversity hotspot: the New Caledonian archipelago. We focused on the consequences of this predation for the outstanding endemic fauna found throughout the rich range of New Caledonian natural habitats. We analyzed > 5300 cat scats sampled from 14 selected sites representing the 4 main natural habitats, with 4 to 6 sampling sessions per year over > 4 years per habitat. Our study reveals previously unreported patterns of cat predation on both alien and endemic species. Throughout the archipelago, cats prey strongly upon squamates, flying foxes and petrels. Feral cat prey included at least 44 native vertebrate species, 20 of which are IUCN Red-listed threatened species. This study adds some 44.4% to the number of IUCN threatened species vulnerable to and preyed upon by feral cats on the world's islands. New Caledonia, while it represents only 0.12% of the total area of islands worldwide (Australia included), hosts 30.8% of IUCN threatened species known to be predated by feral cats. This study recommends prioritizing management and conservation strategies by focusing actions on maquis mosaic and humid forest habitats, where feral cats pose the greatest threat. To limit the impact of feral cats, we recommend conducting targeted management actions on sites key to threatened species conservation, and preventing arrival or promoting eradication on islets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Selectively logged tropical forests retain high species richness and functional diversity, but species composition changes after logging, suggesting that some species are more vulnerable to logging than others. We did a meta-analysis to summarise the effect of logging on the abundance of individual bird and mammal species in tropical forests of Borneo, which have suffered some of the most intense selective logging in the tropics. We found that species classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as 'vulnerable' or 'near-threatened' are generally less abundant in logged tropical forests than those classified as 'least concern'. However, the effect of logging within each IUCN category is variable, indicating that logging is not the only or main cause of decline in abundance. While our results show that closely related species responded similarly to logging, in birds there was significant variation between responses of some closely related species. Bigger species were significantly more susceptible to logging than smaller species in both birds and mammals. We also found that cavity-nesting birds suffered more from logging than did other species. Our results highlight the importance of identifying which factors lead individual species to flourish or suffer in logged tropical forests. © 2016 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Fisheries bycatch is one of the biggest threats to seabird populations. Managers need to identify where and when bycatch occurs and ensure effective action. In 1999, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations released the International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-s) encouraging states to voluntarily assess potential seabird bycatch problems and implement a National Plan of Action (NPOA) if needed. However, the IPOA-s is ambiguous about the steps and objectives, diminishing its value as a conservation tool. We reviewed NPOAs to identify approaches taken to determine whether seabird bycatch is problematic, how bycatch minimisation and population objectives are set, and if thresholds are specified for managing impacts. Our aim was to recommend measures for improving consistency and effectiveness in future NPOAs and other management frameworks for seabirds, with relevance for other threatened marine vertebrates including sharks, turtles, pinnipeds and cetaceans. Globally, 16 NPOAs have been published, but few effectively linked seabird bycatch risk, objectives and management. However, we identified the following best-practice elements that could improve NPOA design: (1) defining explicit risk criteria and methods to assess bycatch problems; (2) setting specific and measurable objectives for minimising bycatch and achieving desired population status; and (3) defining fishery-specific thresholds to trigger management action linked to the population objective. Consistent adoption of NPOA best practice, particularly in states that have not already developed an NPOA, would help to mitigate bycatch threats and ensure fisheries do not reduce the viability of seabird populations. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Dams change the hydrological dynamics, patterns of biological production and distribution of organisms in space and time. In contrast, tributary rivers can function as source areas in reservoirs, since they harbor spawning and early development grounds for native fish species. Here, we analyze a time series of the first 14 years after the impoundment of the Porto Primavera Reservoir, a large reservoir with free tributaries in southeastern Brazil. To evaluate the impact of damming on the fish assemblage, we evaluated the abundance (catch per unit effort, CPUE) and α (species richness and Shannon-Wiener index) and β (Sørensen dissimilarity and turnover) diversity of four sites distributed along the reservoir. Overall, there was no decreasing trend in the α diversity and no increasing trend in the β diversity relative to the initial year or among the sites over time. Despite the expected disturbance in the fish assemblage at the lacustrine site, the sites located near the tributary mouths presented resistant fish assemblages, compensating the results of the overall assessment. We attribute this unusual variation in the ecological attributes to source-sink demographic dynamics, with the undammed tributaries as the source and the reservoir as the sink for native species. We highlight that the presence of these rivers minimized the expected trend towards biotic homogenization, and the preservation of the tributaries is imperative since they contribute to diversity maintenance in areas that are already impacted by damming. The inclusion of this agenda in environmental management programs and new impoundment plans will allow a balance between the demand for electricity production and the conservation of fish diversity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

In general, site-scale habitat quality has a stronger influence on habitat use by fauna than the landscape context. However, this is yet to be empirically tested for reptiles. In this study, we used model averaging and hierarchical partitioning to compare the relative importance of site-scale habitat quality and landscape context for reptile communities and species in a regenerating woodland landscape in semi-arid Queensland, Australia. Reptiles were surveyed at 55 sites. Habitat quality was assessed using relevant variables based on published habitat-associations for each species or group. Landscape context was assessed using binary, mosaic and continuous descriptions of vegetation cover within 250 m of the survey sites. We found that, in comparison to site-scale habitat quality, the composition of the surrounding landscape had little influence on reptiles, despite testing three alternative approaches for describing landscape context. Nine out of eleven reptile species and groups responded to variation in habitat quality, whereas just one species responded to variation in landscape context. Species richness, diversity, and abundance were unaffected by landscape context, but were influenced by site-scale structural complexity and vegetation type. Our findings suggest that reptiles, in general, benefit from conservation and restoration activities that focus on improving site-scale habitat quality, with increasing the amount and connectivity of surrounding vegetation of lesser value. This study also highlights the importance of better understanding the drivers of reptile distributions and abundances in dryland landscapes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Historically, designation of protected areas was biased toward specific habitats, resulting in insufficient representation of other habitats and their associated species. We identified gaps in current protected areas of the Indo-Burma Hotspot, proposed additional areas that could be included in PA systems of this hotspot to increase overall representation, and identified high priority areas for inclusion. Land cover types and threatened terrestrial vertebrate species were used as surrogates of biodiversity, and their representations were assessed using a gap analysis. Areas to be added to improve the hotspot's protected area systems were identified using Marxan software. High priority areas were selected based on irreplaceability and vulnerability. The representation of biodiversity in this hotspot is currently skewed in terms of habitats and species. There is a bias toward mammals in terms of representation (75%), while amphibians are not well represented (27%). With our optimal scenario, 21% of the hotspot's entire land area would need to be included in protected area systems, compared to 16% currently, to achieve more complete representation targets. Myanmar had the most additional areas required. Two-thirds of the additional areas needed to represent conservation features were <10 km2. Several suggested areas were located along borders between multiple countries. Representation within protected areas in the Indo-Burma Hotspot can be significantly improved by focusing on maintaining and restoring linkages between smaller patches to create and sustain larger protected area networks. As part of this enhancement, trans-boundary collaboration among countries within the hotspot will be particularly important. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Invasive species are a major threat for island biodiversity, causing species decline and extinction globally. Of all invasive mammals rats are one of the most detrimental and have been the target of numerous control and eradication programmes. In Mauritius rats have contributed to the extinction of 50% of the island's fauna and are thought to be the main threat to the endemic Mauritius olive white-eye (Zosterops chloronothos), a critically endangered passerine. Assessing the impact of rats and suitable control strategies is often problematic in such cases because of the lack of replicate populations for experiments. Here, we illustrate how to overcome this issue by combining a small-scale rat management experiment on olive white-eyes with demographic models that provide estimates of the potential effects of management on vital rates and population growth. We established poison and trapping grids within breeding territories, and show that rat management significantly decreased rat abundance and increased nesting success. An individual-based stochastic simulation model suggested that rat control could produce a 5-6 fold increase in the annual productivity of female olive white-eyes, which in turn would be sufficient to stabilise population growth. In the absence of rat management, our analysis suggests the olive white-eye population will decline by about 14% per annum. By combining low cost field experiments with widely available demographic models we highlight the value of targeted, effective rat management techniques for both short and long-term population management in threatened passerines. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Previous studies have investigated the drivers of animal charisma, but because collection of species popularity data is costly in terms of time and resources, these are often restricted to a small number of species, making it difficult to generalize results at a scale useful for macroecological studies. Here, we test the hypothesis that animal charisma scales with species body size using nine open-access datasets on animal charisma for 13,680 species from four vertebrate classes: amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. We performed linear mixed models using all studies taken together and, in supplement, linear models on each study separately. We found that animal charisma scales positively with species body size across different vertebrate classes, geographic areas, and charisma estimation methodologies. This general scaling relationship between body size and animal charisma supports large-bodied species to have disproportionate importance for conservation due to their high appeal on people. These findings suggest that body size can be used as a proxy for the charisma of species at broad spatial scales and for large numbers of species, as an alternative to more resource-intensive surveys. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

We quantified relative geographic rarity (area of occupancy), climate niche breadth, and life history traits for 114 freshwater fishes, amphibians, and reptiles in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Our approach leveraged presence-only, publicly available data and traits-based inference to evaluate area of occupancy, climate sensitivity (i.e., climate niche breadth), and a Rarity and Climate Sensitivity (RCS) index of all species across multiple geographic extents, grain sizes, and data types. The RCS index was relatively stable across extents, grains, and data types, with climate sensitivity differentiating species with otherwise similar areas of occupancy. We also found that species with sensitivity-associated traits (e.g., long generation time, low fecundity) were not necessarily the same species identified as at-risk with geographical approaches (small range size, small climate niche breadth). Many multispecies assessments using coarse-scale data (e.g., entire range maps or convex-hull approaches) often focus on a single dimension of intrinsic risk; others rely on data-intensive models only applicable to a few well-studied species. What remains is a need for an approach that enables multispecies, multidimensional assessment efforts. This is particularly true at regional scales, where management needs require assessments that are intermediate to coarse- and fine-scale approaches. We demonstrate that by considering multiple dimensions of intrinsic risk to climate change (range size, climate sensitivity, and traits), site-specific locality data may offer a pathway for ensuring vulnerable, understudied species do not go overlooked in conservation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Deforestation and the conversion of forests to agricultural areas lead to habitat loss and often create highly fragmented landscapes. Permeability and quality of the surrounding matrix determine the connectivity of remaining forest remnants. For mobile species, such as bats, the matrix is not necessarily an entirely insurmountable obstacle. We studied the effects of fragmentation on New-World leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae), a highly diverse keystone taxon in the Neotropics. Bats were assessed in two highly fragmented systems varying in matrix quality: Forested islands surrounded by the water (I) and forest fragments embedded in a matrix of small-scale agriculture (A) together with a continuous forest as control (C). In total, we recorded over 2 years 5176 captures. Observed species richness was highest in continuous forest. Fragmentation reduced in both fragmented landscapes the bat diversity and led to characteristic changes in the bat assemblage, with gleaning animalivorous phyllostomids being most affected. The responses of bats to fragmentation were found to be not only guild - but also species-specific within the guild, a fact easily overlooked or misinterpreted when focussing solely on diversity indices or the response of bat guilds alone. Forest remnants can support a relatively speciose bat fauna, due to the heterogeneity of the inter-fragment matrix. On forested islands, however, isolation processes lead to a decline in bat diversity, resulting in strongly impoverished bat assemblages favouring highly mobile species and habitat generalists. Conservation of the full local bat community of phyllostomids, including the vulnerable gleaning animalivorous phyllostomids, however, requires the protection of old-growth forests. © 2020},

	abstract = {Bumblebees are an essential component of our agroecosystems, and their decline represents a major threat for the sexual reproduction — and hence survival — of wild flowers and several important pollinator-dependent crops alike. The EU bumblebee fauna encompasses many highly imperiled species characterized by a relatively narrow range size and often restricted to high elevation mountain habitats where the threats of both current and future global warming are expected to be particularly severe. In this context, identifying how and where limited conservation resources should be targeted is a pressing priority to meet our fundamental biodiversity conservation targets in an economically-efficient way. Because classical taxonomic approaches to conservation can potentially overlook important alternative aspects of biodiversity such as the phylogenetic diversity, a key component for the maintenance of ecosystem processes and services, I used a multi-gene molecular phylogeny encompassing more than 85% of the EU species to combine categories of the IUCN Red List with the evolutionary legacy and range size of EU bumblebees. My results from phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) and phylogenetic independent contrasts (PIC) analyses first indicate that, contrary to theoretical prediction, evolutionary relatedness explains none of the range size similarity or the probability of extinction risk in EU bumblebees. Furthermore, although the extinction of extant threatened EU bumblebee species is unlikely to have a significant effect on the expected phylogenetic dispersion of the remaining Bombus species at the EU scale, my results clearly illustrate that a significantly disproportionate amount of phylogenetic diversity/evolutionary history might be lost if the extant threatened EU bumblebee species would become extinct. Collectively, this study exemplifies the fact that the incorporation of a phylogenetic approach can increase the efficacy of the existing prioritization for the conservation of EU bumblebees (i) by capturing the phylogenetic diversity and its associated functions, as well as (ii) by better targeting species that are both evolutionarily unique (or non-redundant), threatened and restricted in their range size. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Advances in phenology and pole- and up-ward shifts in geographic ranges are well-documented signs that species are responding to climate change. A deeper understanding of such responses across ecologically different species groups will help to assess future consequences for entire ecosystems. A less well-studied pattern linked with climate change is increases in abundances of warm-adapted species compared with cold-adapted species. To compare how recent climate change has affected the abundances of species across different taxonomic groups, we analyzed long-term local population trends and related them to the species temperature niche, as inferred from geographic distributions. We used population data sets collected in different regions of Central Europe, primarily Germany, for bats, birds, butterflies, ground beetles, springtails and dry grassland plants. We found that temperature niche was positively associated with long-term population trends in some of the taxonomic groups (birds, butterflies, ground beetles) but was less important in others (bats, springtails, and grassland plants). This variation in the importance of temperature niche suggested that some populations have been affected more than others by climate change, which may be explained by differences in species attributes, such as generation time and microhabitat preference. Our findings indicate that relating temperature niches of species to population trends is a useful method to quantify the impact of climate change on local population abundances. We show that this widely applicable approach is particularly suited for comparative cross-system analyses to identify which types of organisms, in which habitats, are responding the most to climate change. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Road-kill is the most recognized impact of traffic and an important threat for biodiversity. Nevertheless, most research on this topic deals with particular species or with road features, describing proximate correlates and rarely making inference on the mechanisms. Here we provide a more general approximation by describing life-history, temporal and spatial factors affecting vertebrate road-kills in Mediterranean landscapes, which are a biodiversity hotspot with little studied road impacts. During one year we recorded the casualties found on paved roads within Doñana Natural Park. We found 2368 road-kills belonging to 66 species (32% of the study area checklist), with abundant ectotherm species more likely to be road-killed. We also investigated the temporal and spatial factors affecting the road-kill patterns of different taxonomic and functional groups. The phenology of the species was the main factor affecting road-kill temporal patterns for lizards, all birds and small mammals. Additionally, rainfall events were associated with the road-kill peaks of wintering birds, whereas high temperatures were related to the increase of road-killed snakes and the decrease of road-killed amphibians. Amphibians, snakes, lizards and small passerines were mainly road-killed according with their spatial abundance. Mitigation measures such as wildlife road-crossing structures showed contradictory effectiveness for small vertebrates due to the lack of adequate drift fences. We suggest prioritizing the mitigation measures which can permanently decrease the risk of been road-killed for ectotherm species, such as specific road-crossing structures with effective drift fences on road-kill hotspots. Concurrently, group-specific temporal mitigation measures should be applied during the road-kill seasonal peaks. The present work provides recommendations to decrease road-kill impacts in Mediterranean environments, but simultaneously tries to contribute to a more general development of road ecology research, suggesting several useful guidelines to perform road-kill studies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

	abstract = {Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) are one of the world's most destructive vertebrate pests. In Australia, they dominate many aquatic ecosystems causing a severe threat to aquatic plants, invertebrates, water quality, native fish and social amenity. The Australian Government is considering release of cyprinid herpesvirus-3 (CyHV-3) as a control measure and consequently a robust, continental-scale estimate of the carp population and biomass is essential to inform planning and risk management. Here, we pioneer a novel model-based approach to provide the first estimate of carp density (no/ha) and biomass density (kg/ha) at river reach/waterbody, basin and continental scales. We built a spatial layer of rivers and waterbodies, classified aquatic habitats and calculated the area of each throughout the range of carp in Australia. We then developed a database of fishery-independent electrofishing catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for habitat types, containing catch information for 574,145 carp caught at 4831 sites. Eastern Australia accounted for 96% of carp biomass and 92% of the total available wetted habitat area (16,686 km2) was occupied. To correct these data for variable detection efficiencies, we used existing electrofishing data and undertook additional field experiments to establish relationships between relative and absolute abundances. We then scaled-up site-based estimates to habitat types to generate continental estimates. The number of carp was estimated at 199.2 M (95%Crl: 106 M to 357.6 M) for an ‘average’ hydrological scenario and 357.5 M (95%Crl: 178.9 M to 685.1 M) for a ‘wet’ hydrological scenario. In eastern Australia, these numbers correspond with biomasses of 205,774 t (95%Crl: 117,532–356,482 t) (average scenario) and 368,357 t (95%Crl: 184,234–705,630 t) (wet scenario). At a continental scale the total biomass was estimated at 215,456 t for an ‘average’ hydrological scenario. Perennial lowland rivers had the highest CPUE and greatest biomass density (up to 826 kg/ha) and the modelled biomass exceeded a density-impact threshold of 80–100 kg/ha in 54% of wetlands and 97% of stream area in large lowland rivers. The continental-scale biomass estimates provide a baseline for focusing national conservation strategies to reduce carp populations below thresholds needed to restore aquatic ecosystems at a range of spatial scales. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Population trends play a large role in species risk assessments and conservation planning, and species are often considered threatened if their recent rate of decline meets certain thresholds, regardless how large the population is. But how reliable an indicator of extinction risk is a single estimate of population trend? Given the integral role this decline-based approach has played in setting conservation priorities, it is surprising that it has undergone little empirical scrutiny. We compile an extensive global dataset of time series of abundance data for over 1300 vertebrate populations to provide the first major test of the predictability of population growth rates in nature. We divided each time series into assessment and response periods and examined the correlation between growth rates in the two time periods. In birds, population declines tended to be followed by further declines, but mammals, salmon, and other bony fishes showed the opposite pattern: past declines were associated with subsequent population increases, and vice versa. Furthermore, in these taxa subsequent growth rates were higher when initial declines were more severe. These patterns agreed with data simulated under a null model for a dynamically stable population experiencing density dependence. However, this type of result could also occur if conservation actions positively affected the population following initial declines-a scenario that our data were too limited to rigorously evaluate. This ambiguity emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying causes of population trajectories in drawing inferences about rates of decline in abundance. © 2015.},

	abstract = {Conservation and environmental management often rely heavily on official statistics, but there are often concerns over accuracy and reliability, particularly true when dealing with sensitive issues such as illegal harvest and trade. A growing number of cases highlight commercial trades in wild flora and fauna that have been undocumented in official data. Here we present the first in-depth study of the trade of wild-collected ornamental plants in continental Southeast Asia, focusing on the four largest wildlife markets in Thailand. Botanical surveys revealed a massive, previously undocumented commercial trade in wild, protected ornamental plants involving Thailand, Lao PDR and Myanmar, focusing primarily on the Orchidaceae. The results indicate that illegal trade threatens not only charismatic Southeast Asian mammals, reptiles and amphibians, but also hundreds of tropical plant species. Trade surveys identified 347 orchid species in 93 genera, including many listed as threatened. The observed cross-border trade moves plants at a rate orders of magnitude larger than government-reported statistics, and directly conflicts with official policy statement. Harvester interviews strongly indicated that wild collection was negatively affecting the majority of species they traded. Despite three decades of broad restrictions on the international trade of all wild orchids, these results highlight a major conservation challenge that has been almost completely overlooked. There is urgent need to improve botanical trade monitoring, to operationalize existing conservation commitments, and as part of a broader, multifaceted response to illegal trade. We call for increased attention to botanical trade and conservation in Southeast Asia, and argue that efforts to tackle illegal wildlife trade must ensure they include flora. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Southeast Asian biodiversity is a global priority for conservation, due to the high levels of diversity and endemism, combined with some of the greatest levels of threat. Conservation planning is essential to ensure that hotspots of biodiversity and endemism have the protection needed to prevent deforestation, hunting and other forms of exploitation in some of the Southeast Asia's most diverse areas, yet this requires data which in many cases does not exist. Growing volumes of online available data provides the ability to develop accurate models of species distributions, and gain new perspectives on regional diversity patterns and provide essential baseline data for planning and conservation. Here, using the best available information I develop maps of the ranges of 2471 vertebrate (birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians) and 1198 plant species, and explore patterns of biodiversity and the adequacy of protection. Each taxon shows different patterns of diversity, and no taxa provided an effective surrogate for diversity patterns in different groups. I show that for the majority of biodiversity hotspots fall outside protected areas, with between 10 and 55% of areas with at least > 75% of the maximum number of species unprotected. The percentage of species ranges protected areas also varies by taxa, from a maximum of 40% to reptiles with a mean of only 13.5% of species ranges protected. Furthermore comparison between my predictions and IUCN maps of diversity differed greatly for all taxa examined, with IUCN hotspots covering a much larger portion of the region and potentially overestimating the ranges of many species. Further efforts are needed to better protect centres of diversity, and the inclusion of these methods into regional conservation planning may greatly assist in increasing the effectiveness of conservation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The current situation precludes non-detriment findings (under which the exporting State ensures that a proposed action will not be detrimental to the survival of a species) intended to enable sustainable use of standing populations, but the Malagasy government, backed by the World Bank, is promoting the sale of massive stocks of confiscated precious wood. We argue that allowing the sale of these stocks would encourage further illegal harvest. No suitable tools are available to identify, control or monitor standing trees or cut timber, and there are substantial knowledge gaps regarding species limits, population sizes, distribution and abundance.

	abstract = {Modern intensified agriculture has decreased farmland heterogeneity, which has led to strong negative effects on farmland biodiversity. However, partly forested landscapes seem to offer many alternative habitats for open habitat species such as butterflies, since modern forestry and development of infrastructure has created several new environments such as forest road verges and power-line corridors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the importance of power-line corridors (PLCs) as butterfly habitats by testing i) if species richness and abundance of butterflies in PLCs are affected by adjacent habitat composition (i.e. comparisons of PLCs with different adjacent habitats), ii) if PLCs act as source habitat through spill-over of individuals into adjacent forest roads and semi-natural pastures and iii) if species composition differs among the investigated habitat types. To investigate this we censused the butterfly fauna in 23 study landscapes in south-central Sweden. We found support for the hypothesis that PLCs may act as source habitats for butterflies in forest roads and pastures, since species richness and abundance were decreasing with increasing distance to PLC from 0 to 500 m. In addition, the species composition in forest roads and pastures close to and far from PLCs was similar, suggesting that this increase was not due to an increase of PLC specialists in the other two habitats. Thus, we have shown that PLCs in themselves are important butterfly habitats independently of adjacent habitat composition (adjacent mature forest, clear-cuts or arable land), and they contribute to increased species richness and abundance of butterflies in surrounding areas over 10 times larger than their own width. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The relative impact of climate change and land use change on biodiversity loss is still under discussion. To alleviate drawbacks related to the use of observed species distributions, we introduce a novel approach to separate the effects of climate change and land use change, the latter split into fragmentation, agricultural intensification and reforestation. This approach, coined the Attribute Importance Analysis (AIA), uses the ability of species attributes to explain population declines. Through the a priori association between attributes and individual drivers, the relative importance of the drivers in causing the species decline can be assessed. We tested this approach on the population decline of vertebrate, insect, vascular plant, and fungi species in the Netherlands since the 1950s. Fragmentation was clearly the strongest driver of species decline for vertebrates and plants, and this may also be true for insects. For fungi, climate change seems the only driver. We found a weak signal of the importance of agricultural intensification for the decline of vertebrates only. We ascribe this unexpected low importance of agricultural intensification to our partitioning of agricultural effects into fragmentation and intensification. Our generic approach can offer valuable quantitative information on the relative importance of drivers that change local community composition without the need for spatial explicit information. Without data on temporal trends in drivers, including local climate and land use change, accurate information on species decline, species attribute values and association of attributes with drivers can give insights into the causes of species decline, which, in turn, can be used to adapt nature management accordingly. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydropower projects are rapidly expanding across lowland Amazonia, driving the conversion of large tracts of once-continuous forests into archipelagos embedded within a vast open-water matrix. Forest vertebrate populations thus become stranded in habitat islands, with their persistence governed by a combination of species life-history traits, habitat patch, and landscape context. We investigate the patterns of species extinction of 34 arboreal and terrestrial vertebrate species within three continuous forest sites and 37 land-bridge islands within one of the largest South American hydroelectric reservoirs, based on a combination of camera trapping, line-transect censuses, sign surveys, and armadillo burrow counts. Forest area was the best predictor of species persistence, so we classified all species into three levels of vulnerability to habitat insularization, with most species defined as 'area-sensitive'. However, island occupancy was decisively determined by individual species traits, with wide-ranging species and poor dispersers showing high local extinction rates. We detected higher island occupancy rates of large vertebrate species compared to other Neotropical fragmented forest landscapes, suggesting that this is critically attributed to the absence of hunting pressure at Balbina. Nevertheless, most terrestrial and arboreal species have been driven to local extinction within the vast majority of islands, which have been largely defaunated. We predicted species composition across all 3546 islands within the reservoir, indicating that only ≤2% of all islands continue to harbour at least 75% of all species. To minimise loss of vertebrate diversity, future hydroelectric dam projects in lowland tropical forests, if unavoidable, should consider their geographic location and landscape structure to maximise both island size and landscape connectivity, and set aside strictly protected reserves within reservoir areas. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

As local factors of remnant forests we included fleshy fruit availability and stand structural attributes, and then analyzed how the relative importance of these factor varies between the breeding (May–August) and non-breeding (September–December) seasons and among three bird size classes. Our results provide new insights into seasonal variations in the factors associated with bird richness and abundance and demonstrate the importance of fruit availability in the remnant forest patches. The main factors showing positive associations with bird richness/abundance were stand structural attributes (e.g., tree basal area) and landscape variables (e.g., proportion of broad-leaved forest) during the breeding season, whereas it was fruit availability during the non-breeding season, when migrating birds are dominant. We detected only minor variations in the associated factors among the three size classes. Thus, preserving continuous mature forests is of great importance for conserving breeding communities of fruit-eating birds, and maintaining fruit availability is an effective approach for supporting migrating birds during the non-breeding season. These findings are applicable to forest management aimed toward biodiversity conservation in regions being replaced or to be replaced by plantations, such as in many areas of temperate East Asia. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Little can be done by natural resource managers to abate climatic extremes such as drought, so assisting ecological communities to withstand and to recover from extreme events is likely to be an effective strategy for reducing the impacts of changing climate conditions on biodiversity. We present a framework for identifying locations that are likely to increase the capacity of biota to withstand disturbances (‘resistance’) and to recover when adverse conditions abate (‘resilience’). Our study ecosystem was the river red-gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) floodplain forests of the Murray River, southeastern Australia. We tracked forest-stand condition of river red-gum forests during and after a prolonged drought (the Big Dry) using models based on remotely sensed data and ground-truthed vegetation measurements of forest-stand condition. Native birds and small mammals respond positively to stand condition. We used spatial optimization to rank the region based on forest-stand condition at multiple time-points during a 13 yr drought and 2 yr after the drought ceased. We identified areas that ranked in the top portion of the landscape in either period to identify ‘resistance havens’ and ‘resilience havens’ respectively and assessed the extent to which these overlapped. Although there was overlap in the top ranked areas, there were differences in the areas identified as havens (top 25% ranking) in both periods, with a 55.5% overlap between areas identified as havens in either period. This overlap was lower (40.1%) when considering the most highly ranked (top 10%) areas. Concentrating only on locations that provide protection from adverse conditions (i.e. refugia) is likely to be ineffective for conservation management in increasingly changeable environmental conditions because areas that facilitate resistance will not necessarily be the same as areas that support recovery. Acknowledging and incorporating the concepts of ecological resistance and resilience into landscape management is vital if managers are to lessen the ecological effects of intensified disturbance regimes associated with climate change. © 2019},

	abstract = {The European Union (EU) has an extensive protected area network, including Special Protection Areas (SPAs) designated under the Birds Directive. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) are sites of international significance for birds identified by BirdLife International. Here, we perform EU-wide terrestrial spatial conservation prioritizations to evaluate the coverage of IBAs by SPAs, and the coverage of bird and other vertebrate distributions by IBAs and SPAs. We then investigate the distribution of potential locations for expanding the SPA network that maximize bird species' representation, and the coverage of these locations by IBAs. On average, SPAs cover 23% of the EU-wide distribution of each bird species and 25% of the distributions of amphibians, reptiles and mammals together, while IBAs provide marginally greater coverage. Overall, 76% of terrestrial IBAs in the EU are completely or partially covered by SPAs, and 66% of the IBA network area is covered by SPAs. Our results suggest that SPA designation has been significantly informed by data on the location of IBAs. While IBAs are identified using data on particular bird species of conservation concern, they also tend to have high EU-wide representation of other vertebrates. The designation of new or expanded SPAs covering a relatively small amount of currently unprotected land (particularly in the southern EU) would substantially increase SPA coverage of bird species ranges. Our analysis provides insights on the current contribution that these sites make to conserving vertebrates across the EU, and future possibilities for efficiently expanding the network. © 2016 The Authors},

	abstract = {Rural populations in the tropics frequently rely on game vertebrates and fish to supply their daily protein requirements. However, few studies have quantified the environmental and socioeconomic drivers of hunting and fishing effort and the potential compensatory relationship between these extractive activities. Here, we assessed game and fish extraction by 222 semi-subsistence households from 28 villages along a major white-water tributary of Brazilian Amazonia. During the 44 months study, a total of 32,114 kg of game and 261,752 kg of fish were harvested, amounting to an average extraction rate of 30.5 ± 109.9 g person− 1 day− 1 and 1519.4 ± 1037.6 g person− 1 day− 1 for game and fish, respectively. While 97.93 ± 0.03% of all fishing trips resulted in fish catches, only 77.12 ± 27.02% of the hunting forays successfully obtained at least one forest vertebrate. The flood pulse had a strong effect on both fishing and hunting activities. However, the seasonally rising floodwaters had a negative effect on fish yield and catch per unit effort (CPUE), but had a positive effect on game yields. Game yield was also an important variable explaining fish yield, indicating a strong compensatory interaction between these two forms of protein acquisition. Our results highlight the importance of considering different modes of animal protein harvesting in conservation planning and management of both forest vertebrates and aquatic organisms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Managed honeybees could spillover after the blooming of MFCs into nearby natural habitats, especially if hive numbers are associated with the cover of MFCs at the landscape scale. Nevertheless, this phenomenon has been largely overlooked despite the potential impacts of honeybees on local wildlife. We assessed this ‘MFC-beekeeping’ association and honeybee spillover into woodland patches in 17 fragmented landscapes in SW Spain with contrasting cover of orange groves as MFC. Hive densities were almost four times greater in landscapes with high cover of orange groves and, after the orange-tree bloom, mean honeybee densities were eight times higher in woodland patches within these landscapes, as compared to landscapes with no/low cover. Seemingly, this spillover was resource-mediated since it mirrored the temporal changes in flower cover at habitat and landscape scales. Our study demonstrates for the first time a consistent spillover of managed honeybees from a MFC into nearby natural habitats. These findings are a warning about the potential detrimental effects of magnified honeybee densities on local fauna and flora, especially on wild bees. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The aim of this study was to estimate the detectability and persistence of road-killed butterflies and to assess the relative contributions of the location on the road, volume of traffic, and presence of scavengers to the removal of dead butterflies. During three independent experiments, dead butterflies from 12 species were placed at randomly chosen locations along selected road sections (both on asphalt and on a verge) with varying vehicle traffic volume (including sections without vehicles) and scavenger abundance. Dead butterflies were counted, scavengers' behaviour was observed, and the traffic volume was measured. The detectability was higher for butterflies placed on asphalt (0.979) than on a verge (0.767) and increased with body size. The removal rate of dead butterflies from asphalt on roads with vehicles was four times faster (persistence probability of 12 h: 0.139) than on roads where vehicles were absent (persistence probability: 0.508). Overall, only 5% of butterflies persisted for a 48-h period. Vehicles and bird scavengers removed 14.9% and 9.6% of dead butterflies, respectively. The probability of dead butterfly removal by birds was positively correlated with traffic, indicating that the number of road-killed butterflies might be substantially underestimated on roads with high traffic. This shows that imperfect detection should be taken into account when estimating the number of road-killed butterflies, especially for butterflies on road verges. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Based mainly on the contents of almost 50,000 fox dietary samples, we provide the first comprehensive inventory of Australian mammal species known to be consumed by foxes, and compare this with a similar assessment for cats. We recorded consumption by foxes of 114 species of Australian land mammal (40% of extant species), fewer than consumed by cats (173 species). Foxes are known to consume 42 threatened mammal species (50% of Australia's threatened land mammals and 66% of those within the fox's Australian range). Reflecting the importance of mammals in their diet, foxes are known to consume a far higher proportion of Australian mammal species (40%) than of Australian birds (24%) and reptiles (16%). Both foxes and cats were most likely to consume medium-sized mammals, with the likelihood of predation by foxes peaking for mammals of ca. 280 g and by cats at ca. 130 g. For non-flying mammals, threatened species had a higher relative likelihood of predation by foxes than non-threatened species. Using trait-based modelling, we estimate that many now-extinct Australian mammal species had very high likelihoods of predation by foxes and cats, although we note that for some of these species, extinction likely pre-dated the arrival of foxes. These two predators continue to have compounding and complementary impacts on Australian mammals. Targeted and integrated management of foxes and cats is required to help maintain and recover the Australian mammal fauna. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Formulating management strategies for mobile marine species is challenging, as knowledge is required of distribution, density, and overlap with putative threats. As a step towards assimilating knowledge, ecological niche models may identify likely suitable habitats for species, but lack the ability to enumerate species densities. Traditionally, this has been catered for by sightings-based distance sampling methods that may have practical and logistical limitations. Here we describe a novel method to estimate at-sea distribution and densities of a marine vertebrate, using historic aerial surveys of Gabonese leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) nesting beaches and satellite telemetry data of females at sea. We contextualise modelled patterns of distribution with putative threat layers of boat traffic, including fishing vessels and large ship movements, using Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. We identify key at-sea areas in which protection for inter-nesting leatherback turtles could be considered within the coastal zone of Gabonese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Our approach offers a holistic technique that merges multiple datasets and methodologies to build a deeper and insightful knowledge base with which to manage known activities at sea. As such, the methodologies presented in this study could be applied to other species of sea turtles for cumulative assessments; and with adaptation, may have utility in defining critical habitats for other central-place foragers such as pinnipeds, or sea bird species. Although our analysis focuses on a single species, we suggest that putative threats identified within this study (fisheries, seismic activity, general shipping) likely apply to other mobile marine vertebrates of conservation concern within Gabonese and central African coastal waters, such as olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea), humpback dolphins (Sousa teuszii) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Earth is undergoing unprecedented urban growth, with urban areas forecasted to increase by 120 million ha from 2000 to 2030, impacting natural habitat. However, to date it is unclear where conservation investments can best mitigate biodiversity loss due to urban expansion into natural habitat. Here we combine spatially-explicit global forecasts of urban expansion, information on terrestrial vertebrate endemism, and data on current land cover and protected areas to define conservation priorities. Globally, 13% of endemics are in ecoregions under high threat from urban expansion. Biodiversity losses are highly spatially concentrated, with 78% of endemics threatened by urban growth occurring in just 30 priority ecoregions (4% of all ecoregions). Natural habitat protection of 4.1–8.0 million ha, <7% of total forecasted urban expansion, would be needed in these priority ecoregions. As an added benefit, such protection would also reduce GHG emissions by an amount worth up to 87.6 billion USD. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {In an attempt to maximize genetic diversity, species reintroductions often target numerous source groups and occur over multiple years. However, the serial introduction of individuals from disparate locations can create unique patterns of genetic structure, with potential implications for demography and population connectivity. To investigate the genetic structure and connectedness of contemporary populations of serially reintroduced American martens (Martes americana) in Wisconsin, we sampled the source populations of Colorado, Minnesota, and Ontario, and the two reintroduction sites within the state. In a relatively small area (~ 7000 km2), we detected six distinct genetic clusters, partitioned according to the original source groups. Source groups exhibited differing degrees of success, with Minnesota and Ontario signatures persisting and Colorado disappearing from the landscape. Two of the genetic clusters had unknown sources not attributable to the reintroduced populations, potentially arising from an early reintroduction attempt or the persistence of a cryptic native population of martens. Limited admixture between clusters was detected, yet we found evidence for the occasional dispersal of martens from each site to the other. Our results suggest that reintroductions can create strong and novel patterns of genetic structure − unseen for this species elsewhere or other vertebrates in the region − across small spatial scales. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Roadkill is among the most severe and insidious causes of impoverishment of vertebrate populations. As large roadkill databases develop, inferences from roadkill data can inform landscape-scale studies with broad conservation aims. The Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network (TaiRON) is one of the largest roadkill databases, and we elucidated taxonomic, seasonal, and temporal trends of roadkill in Taiwan, as well as patterns of protected species roadkill. Notably, the study revealed that snakes were the largest proportion of all roadkill (35%) and 26% of snake roadkills were of protected species. Additionally, the top 23 species of a total 496 species ranked by roadkill abundance made up 50% of the observations. During winter, there were significantly fewer roadkill observations of bats, lizards, and snakes, but birds and mammals had fairly consistent roadkill across seasons. Additionally, 19% percent of the observations were of protected species. The staggering magnitude and extent of roadkill observations collected by TaiRON indicates a clear impact of roads of on Taiwan's vertebrate fauna. The patterns demonstrate that certain taxonomic groups are disproportionately killed on roads, and a small number of species account for most of the mortality. Additionally, certain seasons account for higher frequency of road kills, especially for ectothermic taxa. These are important insights, as this means that there are groups that are highly and disproportionately affected by roads. We hope this first synthesis of all data from TaiRON provides an understanding of the magnitude of roadkill in Taiwan to inform conservation action. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The diversity of Australia's mammalian fauna has decreased markedly since European colonisation. Species in the small-to-medium body size range have been particularly badly affected. Feral cats and foxes have played a central role in this decline and consequently strategies for reducing their numbers are being evaluated. One such strategy is the reintroduction to the mainland of the Tasmanian devil, Sarcophilus harrisii. Here, we provide a palaeontological perspective on this proposal. We begin by collating published records of devil remains in Quaternary deposits. These data show that the range of devils once spanned all the main ecological zones in Australia. This indicates that they are capable of coping with a wide range of climatic and environmental conditions, and suggests that they could conceivably be reintroduced much more widely than has been thought possible hitherto. Subsequently, we examine fossils and coprolites from two sites in the Willandra Lakes Region World Heritage Area. These specimens not only support the suggestion that devils have wide ecological tolerances, but also suggest that devils can coexist with native small-to-medium species over long periods of time, which addresses one of the major concerns about the proposed reintroduction. We believe these two sets of palaeontological observations add substantial weight to the idea of reintroducing devils to the mainland as a way of suppressing cat and fox numbers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Water resource development on rivers significantly affects life cycles of species reliant on wetlands. However, assessing ecological impacts is often difficult because they are realised over long-time periods and large spatial scales, particularly on highly variable dryland rivers. Thirty percent of all Ramsar wetlands are in drylands. We examined the effects of diversions of water upstream on colonial waterbird breeding at the Narran Lakes, supplied by a highly variable dryland river. Narran Lakes is an important Ramsar-listed wetland in Australia for its provision of habitat for wetland fauna during key life history stages, including colonially breeding waterbirds. We use historical ibis breeding data over five decades (1970–2016) to determine the flow requirements for colonial waterbird breeding and modelled the impacts of water resource management options (current and restoration) on breeding. We identified thresholds (>154,000 ML in 90 days with a secondary threshold of >20,000 ML in the first 10 days) of river flow volume necessary to stimulate breeding. Water resource development reduced the frequency of large flows resulting in ibis breeding by 170%, from 1 in 4.2 years to 1 in 11.4 years. Restoration efforts by government to recover water for the environment was predicted to improve colonial waterbird breeding frequency associated with large flow events to 1 in 6.71 years, representing a 59% reduction from pre-development periods. Our framework has global application as a method for identifying long-term impacts of water resource development on key Ramsar wetland areas. This is important, as few mechanisms exist for assessing impacts and identifying restoration options on the listed criteria for many Ramsar wetlands. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {House cats Felis catus have contributed to the extinction of many bird species on islands, but their impact on continental bird faunas is less well resolved. Here, we compile and analyse a comprehensive record of all bird species known to be killed by feral cats at a continental scale. From published studies and unpublished data, we document predation by feral and pet cats on 357 bird species in Australia, including 338 Australian (non-vagrant) native bird species (= 45.6% of the 741 Australian native bird species, excluding vagrants). This tally included 24 species listed as threatened or extinct by the IUCN (40% of the 58 non-vagrant Australian species listed as threatened), and 71 of the 117 bird species (61%) listed as threatened under Australian legislation (or species with one or more subspecies so listed). These tallies are substantially larger than reported in previous reviews. We provide the first continental-scale attempt to model bird species’ traits that are associated with likelihood of being killed by cats, and use such modelling to attempt to redress some inevitable biases in compilation of predation records on birds. We conclude that the likelihood of being killed by a cat was highest for bird species that are restricted to islands, are of intermediate body mass (ca. 60–300 g), and nest and forage on the ground, and least likely for bird species occurring mostly in rainforests and wetlands. We also identify a set of bird species most likely to be threatened by cat-predation and hence most likely to benefit from enhanced management of cats. This study does not specifically evaluate the impact of cats on bird populations or on the conservation of Australian birds, but our results suggest that such impact may be much more pervasive than previously documented. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The conventional approach to conserving threatened biota is to identify drivers of decline, instigate actions to mitigate threatening processes, and monitor interventions to test their effectiveness and ensure target species recover. In Australia, predation by introduced predators is a threatening process for many native mammals. Here we report the results of a 15 year monitoring study in an iconic Australian reserve, Booderee National Park, where exotic Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) populations have been controlled through an intensive poison baiting program since 2003. Unexpectedly, we documented the collapse of native mammal fauna during this period, including fully arboreal species that should be largely unaffected by fox predation – such as the nationally Vulnerable Greater Glider (Petauroides volans) and Common Ringtail Possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus). We used path analysis to explore potential causes of these unexpected declines. We found no compelling evidence to support hypotheses that competition with increasing native species, native predator release, or increases in native herbivores underpinned mammal declines. Beyond the path analysis, data from other studies completed both inside Booderee National Park and outside (where intensive fox baiting does not occur yet depleted fauna species remain), allowed us to rule out several drivers of change. The temporal declines we documented for arboreal marsupials were not anticipated nor explained by any clear mechanism. We propose the use of experimentally-guided reintroductions and translocations to: (1) restore empty niches such as the currently vacant apex mammal predator niche, (2) reconstruct the now depleted arboreal marsupial guild, and (3) further test key hypotheses associated with mammal decline. We also suggest that given the potential for perverse outcomes following large-scale management interventions (even those where there is high confidence of success), wildlife managers should consider maintaining reference areas (where there is no management intervention). Finally, as the declines we documented were unexpected and rapid, there is a clear need to develop more sensitive early warning signals to alert conservation managers to impending problems, allowing them to alter management regimes before major declines occur. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Trade in venomous and non-venomous snakes can negatively impact wild snake populations and may drive snakebite risk for people. However, we often lack sufficient trade data to identify where the potential risks for snake population decline and snakebite are highest. Currently, the legal, international trade of 164 snake species is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). We analyzed CITES-listed snake trade from 1975 to 2018 using the recently released shipment-level CITES Trade Database to identify spatiotemporal trends of snake trade and generate insights regarding snake conservation and potential public health risks from snakebite. Commercially purposed pythons dominated the global snake trade, comprising 38.8% of all traded snakes. Live snakes were mainly exported by Ghana, Indonesia, Togo, and Benin, and imported by China and the USA. Venomous snake trade comprised 10.8% of all traded snakes, and over 75% of wild-sourced venomous snakes came from Indonesia. Although traded snakes in recent years are increasingly comprised of captive-bred animals, the majority of snakes are still wild-sourced (> 60% between 2015 and 2017), including IUCN-listed species, with potentially detrimental impacts on conservation status. Further, the CITES Trade Database reveals geographic regions where venomous snakes are sourced from the wild, posing potential risks to snake catchers, traders, and pet owners. The database also documents the movement of non-native snake species through trade, with implications for conservation of native species. This study represents the first global analysis focused specifically on CITES-listed snake trade using the CITES Trade Database. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Fire has shaped Australia's diverse mammal fauna for millennia. However, ongoing changes to fire regimes threaten native mammal populations, and a significant conservation challenge is to understand and promote desirable forms of pyrodiversity (variation in fire regimes). A way forward is to quantify how different aspects of pyrodiversity influence whole mammal assemblages and produce dynamic maps of species distributions to inform conservation. We aimed to determine and map how spatial and temporal variation in fire regimes correlates with a diverse mammal assemblage comprising macropods, microbats, rodents, small marsupials and a monotreme. We built species distribution models for 17 species against fire, climate and environmental covariates in fire-prone woodlands of semi-arid Australia. Spatial measures of fire included the area, diversity and configuration of landscape elements, and temporal measures included time since fire and fire frequency. Native mammals showed a variety of responses to pyrodiversity. Microbats were more likely to occur as time since fire increased, whereas rodents were correlated with recently burned areas. Small dasyurid marsupials were correlated with the area of older post-fire age-classes, while western grey kangaroo occurrence was positively associated with high diversity of post-fire ages. Our new approach, using predictive models to map mammal distributions in relation to spatial and temporal variation in fire regimes, provides outputs that managers can use to improve conservation planning. This enables the positive and negative effects of fire to be better understood and will assist in achieving desirable forms of pyrodiversity that meet the needs of whole mammal assemblages. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Considering the ongoing loss of aquatic habitats, anthropogenic ponds are gaining importance as substitute habitats. It is therefore important to assess their functioning in comparison to their natural precursors. Here we assess the biodiversity value of sodic bomb crater ponds by comparing their gamma diversity to that of natural reference habitats, astatic soda pans, and assess their importance on the landscape level by studying alpha and beta diversity. We studied aquatic organisms ranging from algae to vertebrates in a dense cluster of 54 sodic bomb crater ponds in Central Europe. Despite the overall small area of the pond cluster, gamma diversity was comparable to that found in surveys of natural habitats that encompassed much wider spatial and temporal scales. We also found a considerable number of species shared with reference habitats, indicating that these anthropogenic habitats function as important refuge sites for several species that are associated with the endangered soda pans. Moreover, we found a number of regionally or worldwide rare species. Among the components of beta diversity, species replacement dominated community assembly. Individual ponds contributed similarly to beta diversity in terms of replacement, being equally important for maintaining high gamma diversity and emphasising the role of the pond network rather than individual ponds. This pattern was seen in all studied groups. Bomb crater ponds therefore acted as important contributors to aquatic biodiversity. Considering the tremendous losses of ponds throughout Europe, anthropogenic ponds should be taken into consideration in nature conservation, especially when occurring in pond networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Introducing consumptive and non-consumptive effects into food webs can have profound effects on individuals, populations and communities. This knowledge has led to the deliberate use of predation and/or fear of predation as an emerging technique for controlling wildlife. Many now advocate for the intentional use of large carnivores and livestock guardian dogs as more desirable alternatives to traditional wildlife control approaches like fencing, shooting, trapping, or poisoning. However, there has been very little consideration of the animal welfare implications of deliberately using predation as a wildlife management tool. We assess the animal welfare impacts of using dingoes, leopards and guardian dogs as biocontrol tools against wildlife in Australia and South Africa following the ‘Five Domains’ model commonly used to assess other wildlife management tools. Application of this model indicates that large carnivores and guardian dogs cause considerable lethal and non-lethal animal welfare impacts to the individual animals they are intended to control. These impacts are likely similar across different predator-prey systems, but are dependent on specific predator-prey combinations; combinations that result in short chases and quick kills will be rated as less harmful than those that result in long chases and protracted kills. Moreover, these impacts are typically rated greater than those caused by traditional wildlife control techniques. The intentional lethal and non-lethal harms caused by large carnivores and guardian dogs should not be ignored or dismissively assumed to be negligible. A greater understanding of the impacts they impose would benefit from empirical studies of the animal welfare outcomes arising from their use in different contexts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Effects of increased N deposition, caused by agricultural practices and combustion of fossil fuels in traffic and industry, have been studied in detail for soil and water chemistry as well as for vegetation and ecosystem functioning. Knowledge on fauna is limited to descriptive and correlative data for a small number of species or communities. Therefore, mechanisms behind effects of N deposition on animal species and diversity remain unclear, which hampers optimisation of nature restoration and conservation measures. The aim of this review is to identify and structure possible different pathways in which fauna is affected by high N deposition. We identify ten pathways leading to six basic potentially negative bottlenecks: (1) chemical stress, (2) a levelled and humid microclimate, (3) decrease in reproductive habitat, (4) changes in food plant quantity, (5) changes in nutritional quality of food plants and (6) changes in availability of prey or host species due to cumulative effects in the food web. Depending on species and habitat type, different pathways play a dominant role and interference between different pathways can strengthen or weaken the net effect of N deposition. Although all identified pathways and bottlenecks are supported by peer reviewed literature, we conclude that scientific evidence on the causal relationship between increased N deposition and effects on fauna in the complete causal chain is still insufficient. We recommend that future research should aim to clarify the causal mechanisms underlying the observed changes in species composition attributed to N deposition. The most severe gaps in knowledge concern subtle changes in plant chemistry and changes in availability of prey and host species to higher trophic levels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The worldwide expansion of road networks is a major concern in biological conservation because of its predominantly negative effects on terrestrial fauna. Roads also affect bats, acting as barriers to movements and causing direct mortality by collisions with vehicles. Among wildlife crossing structures existing to maintain landscape connectivity, road underpasses are considered as one of the most effective conservation measure for bats. While a few studies assessed the effects of underpass attributes on bat use, none to date has assessed the impact of landscape context on underpass use and attractiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we monitored bat activity during three consecutive nights around 24 underpasses selected along a gradient of forest cover. We compared bat activity below and above underpasses (i.e., underpass use), at road sections with and without underpasses and at habitats adjacent to roads (i.e., underpass attractiveness). We found a significant positive effect of forest cover on both underpass use and attractiveness for Myotis spp. and Barbastella barbastellus, and significant negative effects of distance to the nearest forest patch for Rhinolophus spp. and hedgerow length for Myotis spp. Our study highlights the key influence of landscape context on road underpass efficiency to maintain landscape connectivity for bats. We advocate for incorporating a landscape-scale approach in the decision-making process of underpass location during road project planning to enhance efficiency of such costly crossing structures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

We apply occupancy modeling to produce a spatially-explicit diagnostic of potential poaching areas in a protected area of the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot, in Brazil. We used camera trapping along a 13-month period (April 2013 to May 2014) on 39 sampling sites selected using a systematic random design stratified by vegetation type. Using a single-species, single-season occupancy model, we evaluated seven covariates that might influence occupancy and detectability, to identify and compare sites selected by poachers. A total of 7020 trap-days was conducted during the study. Occupancy by poachers was higher near water resources and forest edges. Detectability of poachers was higher near water resources, forest edges and human settlements, in areas with higher abundance of game species, and in periods of higher lunar light intensity. Occupancy-based estimates of poaching matched well historical poaching records in the Reserve, and indicated that poaching pressure is not homogeneous across the Reserve; rather, there are clear poaching hotspots in areas with higher accessibility to poachers. Our results provide subsidies for increasing knowledge about this illegal practice, and points out for future strategies of conservation and management of game species. In addition, our methodological approach may be used in other Reserves to identify poaching hotspots, thus assisting managers in predicting and avoiding this illegal activity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Worm lizards remain one of the least known groups of vertebrates, hindering a proper assessment of their levels of threat, especially in tropical regions where worm lizard diversity is highest and habitat destruction is rampant. We examine trends in description dates, conservation status and their correlations with body and range size, and conduct a spatiotemporal analysis of Brazilian worm lizard sampling gaps using socioeconomic and environmental predictors, to identify drivers of discovery rates and prioritize regions for conducting inventories. Brazilian worm lizards exhibit small body sizes and small and isolated geographic ranges. Threatened, Near Threatened, and Data Deficient species have significantly smaller ranges than Least Concern species and are under intense anthropic pressure. The cumulative number of new species being described has grown exponentially since 1990, with no signs of reaching an asymptote, and recently described species tend to be smaller and have more restricted ranges. Present-day figures grossly underrate worm lizard diversity, which currently cannot be estimated. The vast majority of municipalities have no records of worm lizards and sampling is concentrated in regions with greater accessibility and population size, reflecting the historical patterns of colonization of the territory. The combination of very small geographic ranges, a large number of species yet to be discovered, and high rates of habitat loss, especially in the Cerrado of central Brazil, where the diversity of worm lizards is highest, suggests that extinction of undescribed species is commonplace. The discovery of new species of worm lizard can be accelerated by conducting inventories in unexplored regions, as well as by integrative taxonomic approaches assessing genetic variability in the more widely distributed species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The challenges of sampling rare fauna limit efforts to understand and mitigate the factors that restrict their distribution. Camera traps have become a standard technique for sampling large mammals, but their utility for sampling small, rare species remains largely unknown. The central rock-rat (Zyzomys pedunculatus) is critically endangered and restricted to rugged range country in central Australia. Using Z. pedunculatus as a focal species, we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of camera trapping for sampling small mammals in this environment and to better understand the factors driving the occurrence of this species. We installed baited camera traps at 50 sites across 1795. ha of core refuge habitat for Z. pedunculatus. We recorded all six species of small mammals known previously from this area, including the highly detectable Z. pedunculatus at five sites. Occupancy modelling showed that distance to the nearest occupied site was the most important predictor of Z. pedunculatus occurrence, suggesting that this rodent occurs in discrete sub-populations within the matrix of refuge habitat. Fire history and ruggedness may also influence occupancy of Z. pedunculatus at the landscape-scale and could assist in locating additional sub-populations. At the site-scale, occupancy of Z. pedunculatus was high and there was no clear influence of any site-scale variables. Management of Z. pedunculatus will require protection and expansion of known sub-populations. We conclude that camera trapping provided useful and cost-effective insight into the factors limiting rock-rat distribution, and predict that it will become a standard tool for sampling rare small mammals in difficult-to-access environments. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Medium- and large-bodied mammals (MLM) are of global interest of conservation due to their indispensable role in ecosystem functioning and sensitivity to human activities. Conservationists regard MLMs’ species richness as an important indicator of the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves (NR). However, species richness alone is unable to detect how much of the species pool is realized within local communities, nor the different consequences of loss of species having varying importance in ecosystem functioning on the communities. Here, we simultaneously studied the completeness and defaunation indices (both are useful in informing conservation practices) of MLMs in 33 NRs of Sichuan Province, Southwest China. We evaluated the main correlate (area, habitat heterogeneity, energy, water availability, anthropogenic impact) of each index using Pearson's correlations and generalized least squares regressions. The effects of species’ body size, trophic guild and protection status on the defaunation index were also assessed. The results revealed a significant negative relationship between the two indices across the studied NRs. The NRs with larger elevation ranges (greater habitat heterogeneity) tended to have a more complete MLM fauna and less defaunated than NRs with smaller elevation ranges, and NRs with higher mean annual temperature were also more defaunated. At the species level, large-bodied protected herbivores were more defaunated than other MLM groups. Based on the findings, we argue that habitat heterogeneity and temperature should be the key considerations during NR designing of Sichuan Province to conserve MLM biodiversity, and large-bodied protected herbivores are the priority taxa in further conservation practices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Our knowledge of the conservation status of reptiles, the most diverse class of terrestrial vertebrates, has improved dramatically over the past decade, but still lags behind that of the other tetrapod groups. Here, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation (~92% of the world's ~1714 described species) of the conservation status of skinks (Scincidae), a speciose reptile family with a worldwide distribution. Using International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria, we report that ~20% of species are threatened with extinction, and nine species are Extinct or Extinct in the Wild. The highest levels of threat are evident in Madagascar and the Neotropics, and in the subfamilies Mabuyinae, Eugongylinae and Scincinae. The vast majority of threatened skink species were listed based primarily on their small geographic ranges (Criterion B, 83%; Criterion D2, 13%). Although the population trend of 42% of species was stable, 14% have declining populations. The key threats to skinks are habitat loss due to agriculture, invasive species, and biological resource use (e.g., hunting, timber harvesting). The distributions of 61% of species do not overlap with protected areas. Despite our improved knowledge of the conservation status of the world's skinks, 8% of species remain to be assessed, and 14% are listed as Data Deficient. The conservation status of almost a quarter of the world's skink species thus remains unknown. We use our updated knowledge of the conservation status of the group to develop and outline the priorities for the conservation assessment and management of the world's skink species. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With increasing threats to biodiversity, understanding how ecological characteristics of species influence extinction risks and population declines can be extremely important for the development of public policies for animal conservation, and for better targeting plans for at-risk species. Amphibians represent one of the most threatened vertebrate clades and the Neotropical region has the greatest diversity of anurans in the world. This high species diversity also reflects an exceptional range of anuran ecological, and life-history characteristics, making the Neotropics an optimal place to investigate how intrinsic traits can shape patterns of species decline and extinction. Using a database containing 3182 Neotropical anuran species, we employed comparative phylogenetic methods to investigate the roles of evolutionary history and ecological traits (reproductive mode and habitat) in determining extinction risk and population trends. We found that habitat preference and reproductive mode are strongly related to extinction risk and population decline, and that populations of terrestrial breeders have a greater propensity for the latter. Moreover, although the studied traits are phylogenetically structured, the degree of threat of the studied species appears to be independent of their evolutionary histories. We also highlighted a large number of data deficient species. These data are extremely important as they provide a new perspective regarding traits related to extinction risk. They also provide insights into groups of threatened species and those that may become threatened in the future, and thus assist in decision-making regarding plans and projects for the conservation of Neotropical anurans. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The wildlife trade involves thousands of vertebrate species and now rivals habitat loss as an extinction driver in some regions. However, its impacts are poorly known because field monitoring of wild populations is expensive, localized, and requires specialized expertise. We examined whether market data and expert opinion could be used to identify bird species that may be at risk from the trade in Indonesia. We asked expert ornithologists to characterize population trends of 38 species of Indonesian birds, including many heavily traded species. They identified 14 species as having undergone population declines, all of which are regularly traded, and only two of which are restricted to old-growth forests. Conversely, none of the untraded species was classified as declining. We combined the expert-derived population trends with data on changes in price and trade volume from Indonesian wildlife markets to see if market data could identify declining species. We found that severely declining species have a significantly different price-volume signal than stable/increasing species; the former are characterized by increasing market prices and declining volumes. Market data are much cheaper to collect than field data, roughly 1/30th the cost of a representative field study. We recommend a two-step approach to assess trade impacts on wild birds in Southeast Asia: coordinated market monitoring followed by field studies of species whose market signals indicate declining populations. Our findings, however, require further validation with higher resolution wild population and market data. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Aerial surveys are increasingly used for assessing the presence and abundance of many large faunal species. However, detection rates often suffer significant sightability errors. Using sensors that capture thermal infrared can sometimes improve the detectability of fauna by increasing the contrast of target animals against their surrounds. However, there are several situations where this does not work well. Submerged fauna in marine environments are one example, and where the detection error can be substantial. To identify what wavelength selection might enhance detectability rates beyond standard cameras, we used a drone-based hyperspectral sensor to measure the reflectance of 64 animals and their corresponding surrounds. Fauna included white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), and various other species of ray (Rhinoptera neglecta, Aetobatus narinari, Rhynchobatus australiae) and fish (Seriola lalandi). Data were analysed using Generalized Additive Mixed-Models (GAMM) to compare the difference in spectral reflectance between fauna and their surrounds. The GAMMs showed little difference between submerged fauna groups, but indicated that a band of wavelengths between 514 and 554 nm provided the greatest contrast between fauna and their surrounding backgrounds. This was also consistent across the range of environmental conditions. We contend that restricting the spectral input to a standard high-resolution camera, or focusing on the channels that accentuate the green colours in post-processing, will likely result in increased accuracy in the detection of submerged fauna. This approach may also be applied to fauna surveys in other landscapes, particularly where the use of thermal sensors is not appropriate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Natura 2000 (N2k) is a network of protected areas, established to implement the Birds and the Habitats Directives of the European Union (EU) with the goal of conservation irrespective of national boundaries. We provide the first assessment of the whole terrestrial N2k using spatial prioritizations, and high-resolution vertebrate species distribution data. First, we quantified species' representation in the network, and compared it against outcomes of hypothetical optimal planning scenarios at the EU, member state, and biogeographical levels. Second, we examined the spatial configuration of N2k sites and same-sized hypothetical top priority sites based on the three planning scenarios. We found that N2k covered all vertebrate directive species, and the coverage was significantly better than with a random allocation of sites. We observed substantial differences in representation between taxa, followed by the fact that N2k succeeded better in covering threatened and directive species than non-directive species. The current species representation in N2k was closer to optimal allocations done at member states' or biogeographical levels than the EU-wide allocation. Furthermore, the N2k sites overlapped more with the EU-wide allocation and they were more evenly distributed across the EU compared to sites in all hypothetical optimal allocations. Finally, we found that the biogeographical scenario covered well the ranges of habitats directive species, following the biogeographical approach taken by the EU in the Habitats Directive. Our results show that despite N2k being moderately successful, there is substantial effectiveness to be gained from member state collaboration via potential expansions or complementary conservation policies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The western Amazon needs to expand its protected-area system to ensure the conservation of its immense and threatened biodiversity. However, potential expansions often meet with resistance because of scarce government resources and competing social priorities. Here, we proposed an expansion of the protected-area system for the western Amazon that increases biodiversity conservation at minimum costs. We started by evaluating biological data to establish conservation targets for enhancing protection of 2419 species of plants and vertebrates. We then built a map that shows the variation in costs of effectively managing lands as protected areas. We also adapted an opportunity cost layer for agriculture and livestock to approximate realistic foregone incomes when a particular extent of land is protected. These cost estimates were used in a decision-support tool to find the most inexpensive places to achieve the conservation targets. We found that this cost-optimized expansion would reduce annual costs by 22% in comparison to an expansion planned without cost data. Moreover, without collaboration with indigenous peoples and without cooperation among the western Amazon countries costs would be 39% and 49% higher, respectively. The cost of the proposed expansion, estimated at US$ 100 million annually, is only a fraction of the regional Gross Domestic Product (0.018%). Thus, this study may help governments and conservation agencies to improve financial planning of the region's reserve network by maximizing species protection at more affordable costs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate change is a key driver of biodiversity loss across the globe, and freshwater fishes are predicted to be among the most vulnerable taxa. African freshwater ecosystems are home to one of the most unique and diverse ichthyo-faunas on the planet, and freshwater fish species provide essential livelihoods for millions of people living in riparian communities across the continent. Although nearly one sixth of African freshwater fishes have been designated as endangered or vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN Red List assessment, the effects of climate change on these species have not been explored on a continent-wide scale. In this study, we present the first trait-based climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) comprising the majority (85%) of Africa's currently described freshwater fishes. We assembled data relating to three dimensions of vulnerability including sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and exposure. In addition, we developed an index of ‘conservation value’ based on traditional conservation metrics including extinction risk, endemism, and provision of ecosystem services. We found that almost 40% of African freshwater fishes are vulnerable to climate change, mostly owing to the many species with highly specialized habitat and life-history requirements, and because of the numerous anthropogenic stressors they face. High proportions of species within the Nothobranchiidae and Cichlidae families were found to be vulnerable. Regions with high frequencies of vulnerable species included the African rift valley lakes, the Congo River drainage, and the coastal rivers of West Africa. Several important data deficiencies were identified relating to species' population sizes, genetic variability, and life history traits, and constitute priority research areas for the future. In addition, we highlighted some cases where traditional conservation approaches overlook species and regions that are predicted to be threatened by climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Large protected areas have been created in Brazilian Amazon intending to safeguard as much of its biodiversity as possible. Despite these intentions, such megareserves were created predominantly focusing on terrestrial organisms and ecosystems. Here, we assessed the ability of the current Brazilian Amazon protected areas network to efficiently safeguard its stream-dwelling fish fauna. Ecological niche models were built for 138 stream fish species using MaxEnt software. We performed a gap analysis and spatial prioritization under three different Amazon protected areas scenarios: (1) strictly protected areas (SPAs) only; (2) SPA plus sustainable use areas (SPA + SUA); and (3) SPA + SUA plus indigenous territories (SPA + SUA + IT). The species were classified according to their distribution range size and required representation targets. Widespread species usually had lower area under the curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS) values, which would be expected for large and heterogeneous areas such as the Amazon. Only partial gap species were found, with 20% to 90% of required representation targets included in PAs, which was not enough for a complete protection. Most of the officially protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon do not correspond to areas with high direct conservation values for stream fishes, once the priority areas for these species conservation were outside the PAs, leaving a high portion of the regional vertebrate fauna inadequately protected. We conclude that fishes and other freshwater organisms and habitats should be explicitly included during systematic conservation planning in order to thoroughly protect the Brazilian Amazon biodiversity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The assessment of effects of anthropogenic disturbance on biodiversity (BD) and ecosystem services (ES) and their relationships are key priorities of the Intergovernmental Panel for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Agricultural landscapes and their associated BD provide multiple ES and it is crucial to understand how relationships between ES and BD components change along gradients of landscape complexity. In this study, we related eight ES potentials to the species richness of five invertebrate, vertebrate and plant taxonomic groups in cereal farming systems. The landscape complexity gradient ranged from areas dominated by annually tilled arable land to areas with high proportions of unfertilized, non-rotational pastures and uncultivated field borders. We show that after accounting for landscape complexity relationships between yield and bird richness or biological control became more positive, but relationships between bird richness and biological control became less positive. The relationship between bird and plant richness turned from positive to negative. Multidiversity (overall biodiversity), was positively related to landscape complexity, whereas multifunctionality (overall ES provision), was not significantly related to either one of these. Our results suggest that multidiversity can be promoted by increasing landscape complexity; however; we found no support for a simultaneous increase of several individual ES, BD components or multifunctionality. These results challenge the assumption that biodiversity-friendly landscape management will always simultaneously promote multiple ES in agricultural landscapes. Future studies need to verify this pattern by using multi-year data, larger sets of ES and BD components and a study design that is appropriate to address larger spatial scales and relationships in several regions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Deforestation, ecosystem homogenization, and diversity loss are frequent problems in tropical livestock systems, which can foster substantial human-wildlife conflict when wild carnivores with declining prey bases turn to cattle depredation. The objective of this paper was to examine spatial and temporal variation in the presence, composition, and diversity of wild fauna, including predators and their prey base, in a well-established tropical livestock system. The study was conducted on a ~ 140,000 ha ranch in the Cerrado-Pantanal transition zone in Brazil, where large areas of improved pasture are bounded by blocks of intact montane forests and seasonally flooded lowland habitat. The study sampled wildlife with camera traps distributed across the land use gradient and rancher depredation observations were also obtained. Depredation accounted for the loss of 0.9% of the total herd in the sampling year, and the number of depredation events was greater closer to intact forest and distant from centralized ranch structures and mechanized operations. Mammal diversity was greatest adjacent to intact forest and supported a complete representation of the native trophic structure, including large predators such as jaguar (Panthera onca), puma (Puma concolor), and maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and a diverse and abundant prey base. Sites progressively distant from intact forest and with more intensive conversion and development supported smaller subsets of the diversity and composition, and no apex predators. Livestock management practices to reduce the economic impact of depredation on calves requires faithful adherence, while opportunities exist for landscape management that will enhance diversity and facilitate movement of large mammals between intact forests. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) aims to ensure international trade in CITES-listed species is sustainable, legal and traceable.

We address this by analysing the CITES Trade Database: >16 million shipment records for 28,282 species, from 1975 and 2014. Over this period, the volume of reported trade in CITES-listed wildlife quadrupled, from 25 million whole-organism equivalents per year to 100 million, and the ratio of wild- to captive-sourced trade in mammals, birds, reptiles, invertebrates and plants declined by an order of magnitude or more. Our findings start to reveal the scale of the legal wildlife trade, shifting trade routes and sources over time and we describe testable hypotheses for the causes of these changes. © 2018},

	abstract = {Changes in land-use and climate increase the flammability of forests across southeast Amazonia, potentially driving abrupt fire-mediated transitions to derived savannas – grass-dominated degraded forests with scattered trees. However, the extent to which the forest fauna undergoes a parallel process remains poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that the process of fire-driven forest shifts towards derived savannas has congruent cascading effects on ant communities by causing declines in forest specialists and an influx of open-habitat taxa. In 2013 we collected ants using subterranean, epigaeic and arboreal pitfall traps in three adjacent 50-ha plots: an unburnt control and two treatment plots that were burnt either triennially or annually from 2004 to 2010. Frequent fire was associated with a marked decline of specialist forest species (almost 50%), and an influx of open-habitat taxa that were absent from the unburnt plot. The effects were particularly pronounced for epigaeic ants: their abundance, biomass, species richness and species composition were impacted by fires, and this was the main stratum occupied by the open-habitat species. Previous studies have shown that a similar conversion is not triggered by single fires, and they therefore require recurrent fires. Our results provide experimental evidence that the process of tropical forest conversion towards derived savannas caused by repeated burning is a broad one that affects not only plants, but involves parallel compositional shifts of animal communities. The prevention of recurrent fires is a priority challenge for avoiding widespread biotic conversion of tropical forests to derived savannas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Compared to the global average, extinction risk for mainland African reptiles, particularly for South Africa, appears to be relatively low. Despite this, African reptiles are under threat primarily due to habitat loss as a result of agriculture, resource extraction, and urbanisation, and these pressures are expected to increase into the future. South Africa's reptile fauna is relatively well-studied, allowing an investigation of whether threat status assessment limitations are driving the comparably low threat status for the country, a large component of Africa's reptile fauna (ca. 25% of mainland African reptiles are found in South Africa). Extinction risk of South African reptiles was assessed as of 2018 using IUCN criteria and we ‘backcast’ these assessments to infer extinction risk circa 1990. A Red List Index (RLI: a measure of the extinction risk for a group of species) for 1990 and 2018 was estimated, and the protection level afforded to South African reptiles was investigated by intersecting reptile distributions with the network of protected areas. Finally, a coarse estimate of extinction rate was made. Level of extinction risk for South African reptiles (ca. 5.4%) is lower than the global average, and most currently threatened species would have already been at risk by 1990. The RLI was slightly lower for 2018 than for 1990, and the decrease was more prominent for endemic reptiles than for all reptiles combined. Most South African reptiles fall into the Well Protected category, implying that the protected area network has substantial conservation impact. However, many threatened reptile species are Poorly Protected or Not Protected. The current extent of the protected area network therefore, does not adequately mitigate extinction risk for reptiles. Furthermore, the protected area expansion plan for South Africa would not capture any additional threatened species within its boundaries. Despite the lower level of extinction risk indicated by IUCN assessments, it would be premature to assume that South African reptiles are faring better than reptiles globally based only on this one measure. Notably, two South African reptiles are Critically Endangered and theses are not found in protected areas, two others are already classified as Extinct, and rough estimates of extinction rates are similar to values estimated for other vertebrates. By considering additional metrics that are directly guided by our in-depth knowledge of the species, their distributions and the threats, we demonstrate that South African reptiles are under pressure and that risk of extinction is tangible for several species. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Management efforts for endangered species are enhanced by knowledge of the causes and extent of demographic variation, but this information is often lacking even when abundance is well known. We developed an integrated population model to study the dynamics of the only remnant population of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) in North America, 1977-2013. Despite much conservation attention for this species, there has been little study on temporal variability in demography and how that variation contributes to population dynamics. Demographic rates were most variable for fledge rate and survival of the youngest age classes while adult survival was less variable. Population growth was influenced mainly by variation in fledge rate, breeding propensity and survival of hatch year and second year cranes while survival of older age classes had less influence. Fledge rates were correlated to the boreal snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus)-Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) cycle and were lowest 2 years after increases in lynx population growth. In terms of management, mean annual fledge rates were similar between years with and without egg collection for captive rearing (0.523 vs 0.518), suggesting no influence of this practice on population-level productivity. Our findings add to the growing body of results showing that while population growth may be most sensitive to changes in adult survival in long-lived vertebrates, variation in breeding parameters often drives annual fluctuations in abundance. Maintaining adult whooping crane survival at currently high rates and increasing breeding output where possible may be effective management strategies for achieving conservation goals. © 2016.},

	abstract = {Climate change poses a severe global threat to freshwater ecosystems. Aestivating freshwater fauna (i.e., those that undergo periods of dominancy during dry periods) are likely to be highly susceptible to climate change due to their unique life-cycles, although empirical data that demonstrates this are lacking. This study utilised two aestivating fishes as model species, the salamanderfish, Lepidogalaxias salamandroides, and the black-stripe minnow, Galaxiella nigrostriata; both of which are endemic to Australia's Southwestern Province, an area undergoing a severe drying trend that global climate models project will continue. We found that the distributions of both species have undergone large reductions in extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), coinciding with an extensive period of severe drying of the region. L. salamandroides was more likely to be found in deeper pools, while G. nigrostriata was found more often in pools with greater connectivity, and the probability of occurrence of both species was significantly associated with lower water temperature and pH, and higher oxidation-reduction potential. The majority of those factors are strongly influenced by the local climate, as stable isotope analyses found the hydrology of the pools in which they occurred was influenced by winter rainfall, either through direct input and/or expression from a superficial aquifer. This suggests that increasing water temperature and declining rainfall, features of the climatic shift in south-western Australia over the last 40. years, have been the major drivers of the observed declines in range. Given that climate models project both continued rainfall reductions within the species' distributional ranges and water table decreases by up to 4. m by 2030, further population losses are expected. Moreover, a review of the distribution of aestivating fish species throughout the world revealed that 75% are found in regions projected to dry due to climate change. This has considerable management implications, and active intervention, such as the protection of their existing environments and the creation of new suitable habitats, is required to prevent species declines. Fortunately, at least for the two aestivating species found in Western Australia, artificial ponds are utilised and therefore the construction of new waterbodies could help halt their decline, although further research is required to develop the optimal design for species persistence. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Conservationists are increasingly concerned about North American bats due to the arrival and spread of the White-nose Syndrome (WNS) disease and mortality associated with wind turbine strikes. To place these novel threats in context for a group of mammals that provides important ecosystem services, we performed the first comprehensive conservation status assessment focusing exclusively on the 45 species occurring in North America north of Mexico. Although most North American bats have large range sizes and large populations, as of 2015, 18–31% of the species were at risk (categorized as having vulnerable, imperiled, or critically imperiled NatureServe conservation statuses) and therefore among the most imperiled terrestrial vertebrates on the continent. Species richness is greatest in the Southwest, but at-risk species were more concentrated in the East, and northern faunas had the highest proportion of at-risk species. Most ecological traits considered, including those characterizing body size, roosting habits, migratory behavior, range size, home range size, population density, and tendency to hibernate, were not strongly associated with conservation status. However, nectarivorous bats tended to be more at risk. The conservation status of bats improved from 1985 to 2000 as human disturbances to roosting sites were reduced, but then declined sharply (7%) by 2015 due principally to threats from WNS and wind energy. Although uncertainty about threats from pollution and climate change remain, past experience shows that when threats are clearly identified and management actions taken, populations can recover. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {Invasive rodents have an overwhelmingly detrimental impact to native flora and fauna on islands. Rodent eradications from islands have led to valuable biodiversity conservation outcomes. Tropical islands present an additional suite of challenges for rat eradications due to unique characteristics associated with these environments. To date tropical island rat eradications have failed at a higher rate than those undertaken outside the tropics. Critical knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of what drives this outcome. We collated an in-depth dataset of 216 rodenticide based rat eradication operations (33% of all known rodent eradications) in order to determine correlates of eradication failure, including both project implementation factors and target island ecology, geography and climate. We assessed both failed and successful projects, and projects inside and outside the tropics, using random forests, a statistical approach which compensates for high dimensionality within, and correlation among, predictor variables. When assessing all projects, increasing mean annual temperature, particularly above 24. °C, underscored the higher failure rate and greater difficulty of rodent eradications on islands in lower latitudes. We also found clear trends in eradication failure for factors unique to the tropics, including the presence of land crabs - burrowing and hermit crabs, and coconut palms (. Cocos nucifera). The presence of agriculture was also associated with failure. Aerial operations had a higher success rate than ground-based methods but success with this technique was less likely in the presence of hermit crabs and other non-target bait consumers. Factors associated with failure in ground-based eradication methods suggested limitations to project scaling such as island area and number of staff. Bait station operations were less likely to succeed when using stopping rules based on measures of rodent abundance. Factors influencing rat eradication failure in tropical environments continue to require a deeper understanding of tropical island dynamics to achieve a higher rate of eradication success. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {A recent boom in hydroelectric development in the world's most diverse tropical river basins is currently threatening aquatic biodiversity on an unprecedented scale. Among the most controversial of these projects is the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Complex (BMHC) on the Xingu River, the Amazon's largest clear-water tributary. The design of the BMHC creates three distinctly altered segments: a flooded section upstream of the main dam, a middle section between the dam and the main powerhouse that will be dewatered, and a downstream section subject to flow alteration from powerhouse discharge. This region of the Xingu is notable for an extensive series of rapids known as the Volta Grande that hosts exceptional levels of endemic aquatic biodiversity; yet, patterns of temporal and spatial variation in community composition within this highly threatened habitat are not well documented. We surveyed fish assemblages within rapids in the three segments impacted by the BMHC prior to hydrologic alteration, and tested for differences in assemblage structure between segments and seasons. Fish species richness varied only slightly between segments, but there were significant differences in assemblage structure between segments and seasons. Most of the species thought to be highly dependent on rapids habitat, including several species listed as threatened in Brazil, were either restricted to or much more abundant within the upstream and middle segments. Our analysis identified the middle section of the Volta Grande as critically important for the conservation of this diverse, endemic fish fauna. Additional research is urgently needed to determine dam operations that may optimize energy production with an environmental flow regime that conserves the river's unique habitat and biodiversity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Reptiles represent the world's most diverse group of terrestrial vertebrates (~ 10,300 recognized species). Knowledge of their conservation status, however, lags behind that of birds, mammals and amphibians. Only ~ 40% of the world's reptile species have had their conservation status assessed by the IUCN, and detailed analysis of extinction risk has been limited to a subset of 1500 species. Using lizards (Sauria and Amphisbaenia), the most diverse group of reptiles, we investigated whether biases in distribution, ecology, life-history and taxonomy exist in the species that have been assessed to date by the IUCN. Our results highlight that only 36% of the ~ 6300 described lizard species have had their conservation status assessed. Whilst data deficiency is a key concern in lizards (16% of assessed species), the large number of non-assessed species (~ 4000 species) represents a larger and more pressing issue. Accentuating this ‘assessment gap’ is the fact that biases exist in the subset of lizard species that have been assessed by the IUCN. Australia and Asia, as well as tropical areas in general, were the least assessed regions. Assessed lizard species were more likely to have larger body and clutch sizes, broader distributional and elevational ranges, occur at more northerly latitudes, and have a viviparous mode of reproduction. Some evidence suggests that they also tend to be diurnal, surface active, and with developed limbs. The level of assessment also differed significantly among lizard families and higher taxa. We recommend the implementation of an integrated approach to bridge the ‘assessment gap’ in lizards, involving regional and taxon-specific working groups associated with the IUCN's Global Reptile Assessment, predictive modelling, enhanced knowledge of lizard distribution and biology, and improved taxonomic methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Invasive vertebrates are a leading cause of extinction on islands and rats (. Rattus spp.) are one of the most damaging to island ecosystems. Methods to eradicate rats from islands are well established and there have been over 580 successful eradications to date. Increasingly, rat eradications are being implemented on tropical islands, a reflection of the need to protect the threatened biodiversity in the tropics. Yet rat eradications on tropical islands fail more frequently than those in temperate climates. In an effort to identify the main reasons for the lower success rate on tropical islands and possible solutions, a workshop was convened with 34 experts in rat eradication, tropical rodent and island ecology and toxicology. The workshop focused on projects using aerial broadcast of brodifacoum, a 2nd generation anticoagulant, because this approach has provided the highest success rate for eradicating rodents from islands. The workshop participants reviewed previously identified challenges to successful rat eradications on tropical islands including increased insect and crab densities resulting in competition for bait, year round or unpredictable timing of breeding rats and increased or unpredictable availability of alternative, natural foods. They also identified a number of new, likely reasons for the lower success rate on tropical islands and provided recommendations for how to address these risks in the planning and implementation of rat eradications. While the success rate of aerial broadcast rat eradications in tropical environments is quite high at 89% (. n=. 47), it is hoped that by following the recommended best practices provided in this paper, future success rates will be closer to the 96.5% (. n=. 116) demonstrated for aerial broadcast rat eradications on temperate islands. © 2014 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Recent work in the tropics has advanced our understanding of the local impacts of land-use change on species richness. However, we still have a limited ability to make predictions about species abundances, especially in heterogeneous landscapes. Species abundances directly affect the functioning of an ecosystem and its conservation value. We applied a hierarchical model to camera- and live-trapping data from a region in Borneo, and estimated the relative abundance (controlling for imperfect detection) of 57 terrestrial mammal species, as a function of either categorical or continuous metrics of land-use change. We found that mean relative abundance increased (by 28%) from old-growth to logged forest, but declined substantially (by 47%) in oil palm plantations compared to forest. Abundance responses to above-ground live tree biomass (a continuous measure of local logging intensity) were negative overall, whilst they were strongly positive for landscape forest cover. From old-growth to logged forest, small mammals increased in their relative abundance proportionately much more than large mammals (169% compared to 13%). Similarly, omnivores and insectivores increased more than other trophic guilds (carnivores, herbivores and frugivores). From forest to oil palm, species of high conservation concern fared especially poorly (declining by 84%). Invasive species relative abundance consistently increased along the gradient of land-use intensity. Changes in relative abundance across nine functional effects groups based on diet were minimal from old-growth to logged forest, but in oil palm only the vertebrate predation function was maintained. Our results show that, in the absence of hunting, even the most intensively logged forests can conserve the abundance and functional effects of mammals. Recent pledges made by companies to support the protection of High Carbon Stock logged forest could therefore yield substantial conservation benefits. Within oil palm, our results support the view that “wildlife-friendly” practices offer a low potential for reducing biodiversity impacts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Even though wildlife trade permeates the Tree of Life, most analyses to date focused on the trade of a small selection of charismatic vertebrate species. Given that vertebrate taxa represent only 3% of described species, this is a significant bias that prevents the development of comprehensive conservation strategies. In this short contribution, we discuss the significance of global wildlife trade considering the full diversity of organisms for which data are available in the IUCN database.

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) therefore remains an important mechanism in tackling species declines. Appropriate listing of species on CITES Appendices avoids both unwarranted trade-controls and unsustainable trade and is, therefore, essential for the effective functioning and integrity of the Convention. The current process for assessing the appropriateness of existing species listings is considered time-consuming and inefficient. Here, we introduce a rapid risk assessment framework that combines assessments of species Red List conservation status with quantity of reported trade to provide insights into the risk posed to species from legal trade. We demonstrate the approach for ∼2500 vertebrate species listed on CITES Appendix II and identify a group of >1000 species that are not threatened (Red List category Least Concern) and had zero or an average of fewer than ten trade records per year. For these species, international trade is highly unlikely to pose a risk and so they may not merit inclusion on Appendix II on the basis of trade posing a threat to species survival. We suggest that the efficient risk assessment approach we apply here could be used to rapidly assess the appropriateness of species listings and, therefore, has the potential to improve the effectiveness of the Convention. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Deforestation is a major cause of biodiversity loss, and the predominant factor driving deforestation is expansion of agriculture. A key step toward successful conservation in agricultural areas is maximizing biodiversity value of remaining forest. In subtropical and tropical regions, forest often is left in narrow strips between agricultural fields under the assumption that biodiversity is sustained. We examined use of forest strips and continuous forest by medium and large-sized mammals in Argentine Chaco with camera trapping and hierarchical Bayesian zero-inflated occupancy models and assessed how use related to ecological traits of species. Almost 70% of the species cited for our study area were not detected or were detected in less than 10% of the sampling units. Ten of the 23 species that occurred in the area were absent from strips or were detected most frequently in continuous forest, including all large-bodied species and forest interior specialists. Low occurrence of mammals in strips and in continuous forest raises major concerns related to long-term persistence of mammals in Chaco. Under current development policies, agriculture will continue to expand in this region, further threatening the second largest forest in South America. Alternative configurations for the forest-agriculture landscape, as well as synergism between landscape configuration and other threats, need to be evaluated and incorporated into policy if the rich mammalian fauna of this region is to be conserved. © 2015.},

Here, we provide a systematic, continental-scale evaluation of the extent and quality of monitoring for threatened species, focussing on terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates in Australia. We found marked inadequacies: one in four threatened taxa are not monitored at all; for taxa that are monitored, monitoring quality, as assessed across nine metrics, was generally low. Higher quality monitoring was associated with policy recognition, in the form of species recovery plans, and for species having a more imperilled conservation status. Across taxonomic classes, the proportion of species monitored was highest for mammals and then birds, whereas monitoring quality was greatest for birds. Improving monitoring quality requires setting clear objectives, direct integration with management, incorporating explicit management triggers, long-term resourcing, and better communication and accessibility of monitoring information. While our results revealed that overall monitoring efforts are inadequate, the positive relationship between improved monitoring outcomes and national policy support highlights that, when resources are available, good monitoring outcomes can be achieved. Quality monitoring programs for threatened species, and biodiversity more generally, should be recognized as vital measures of a nation's progress, analogous and complementary to more widely-used economic and human health indicators. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The validity of the threat status assigned to a species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List relies heavily on the accuracy of the geographic range size estimate for that species. Range maps used to assess threat status often contain large areas of unsuitable habitat, thereby overestimating range and underestimating threat. In this study, we assessed 18 endemic birds of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot to test the accuracy of the geographic range sizes used by the IUCN for their threat assessment. Using independently reviewed data from the world's largest citizen science database (eBird) within a species distribution modeling framework, our results show that: (a) geographic ranges have been vastly overestimated by IUCN for 17 of the 18 endemic bird species; (b) range maps used by IUCN contain large areas of unsuitable habitat, and (c) ranges estimated in this study suggest provisional uplisting of IUCN threat status for at least 10 of the 18 species based on area metrics used by the IUCN for threat assessment. Since global range size is an important parameter for assigning IUCN threat status, citizen science datasets, high resolution and freely available geo-referenced ecological data, and the latest species distribution modeling techniques should be used to estimate and track changes in range extent whenever possible.

	abstract = {Dredging presents a risk of injury or mortality to marine turtles via entrainment, vessel strike or the effects of noise and vibration. Dredging operations have increased in recent years, yet there remains an absence of supporting information for development proponents and regulators to accurately determine dredge-related impact predictions for marine turtles within an Environmental Impact Assessment. This absence therefore has implications for their conservation, as certain dredging impacts may be overlooked or the implementation of control measures and response strategies may be ineffective. This study presents a case study involving a major resource development whose proponent undertook satellite tracking of 48 reproductively-active flatback turtles (Natator depressus) at different stages of its dredging operation (before: n = 20, during: n = 10 and after: n = 18). In addition, trained Marine Fauna Observers were on-board dredge vessels to mitigate interaction and detect injury and mortality events. We compared the dredge-related impact predictions stated in the Environmental Impact Assessment with the quantified dredge-related impact to flatback turtles as represented by changes to their movement and dive behaviour between each stage of the dredging operation and any injury and mortality events. Additionally, we considered the effectiveness of implemented dredge-related control measures in preventing their injury or mortality. We found that during the active dredging operation, flatback turtles increased their use of the dredging areas. Dive behaviour results showed they undertook longer and deeper resting dives during dredging, utilising the now deeper waters of the dredging areas. Possible reasons for this preferential use of areas being dredged are discussed. Despite their increased use and the presence of active dredge vessels, no events of injury or mortality were recorded. The implemented control measures may have been effective in preventing injury or mortality, though the spatial scale of their effectiveness may have been smaller than first anticipated. Our results are of great value for stakeholders involved in marine turtle conservation and managing dredging operations worldwide as no comparison of quantified marine turtle survivorship, movement and dive behaviour data at different stages of a dredging program has been recorded or reported previously. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

As conservation funding is limited, identifying priority areas for conservation of species prone to climatic impacts may improve the benefit of conservation investments. As part of its Biodiversity Action Plan, China is carrying out an initiative to evaluate new threats from climatic impacts by 2030 in Priority Areas for Biodiversity Conservation (PABCs). Focusing on floods, which are exhibiting an increasing trend in recent decades in the country, we generated information for such an initiative. We investigated contemporary flood exposure and species internal refugia for all amphibians, birds, and mammals within the 32 terrestrial PABCs of China. Amphibians comprised the greatest number of species at significant flood exposure followed by mammals and birds (~ 90%, ~ 81%, ~ 52% of the total species richness in the country, respectively). However, availability of flood-free internal refugia >. 10% and ≤. 25% was found for ~ 15% mammals, ~ 29% birds and ~ 1% amphibians. Large areas within PABCs are highly exposed to floods. Species in these areas possessing traits that contribute sensitivity and low adaptability to flood disturbance are the ones expected to face negative delayed effects from past exposure, or to possess less resilience to future impacts, including human activities. In the face of multiple threats we call for implementation of cost-effective strategies that strengthen ongoing conservation actions in flood-prone areas and refugia (e.g., landscape connectivity, habitat restoration, afforestation) to better assist in the allocation of limited resources for protecting vulnerable species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Nature-based activities promote human-fauna encounters, which may be perceived as a type of predation risk. This pattern of human avoidance is well-known, but is often related to major anthropogenic disturbances. The response of animals to less intensive or ephemeral human activities, such as backcountry skiing and hiking is not well studied. Yet, these activities occur in many protected areas, where managers are trying to conserve some of the most threatened species. This is the case for the Endangered Atlantic-Gaspésie mountain caribou in the Gaspésie National Park. To assess the impact of backcountry skiing, we used GPS telemetry to monitor 20 caribou frequenting a ski area partially included in the Park. More than 12% of caribou locations were within the ski area when skiers were absent. Use of that area by caribou decreased to 6% when there were skiers. Coefficients from a resource selection function suggested that caribou avoided the ski area, and the disturbance response was modulated by the number of skiers. Caribou were not significantly displaced within the first 6 h of exposure to skiers, but thereafter moved away from the ski area for ~ 48 h to lower elevation habitats where predation from coyotes was potentially greater. Our results revealed a relatively strong disturbance response and corresponding functional loss of a possible noticeable portion of habitat as a result of backcountry skiing.

	abstract = {Forest fragments are increasingly common in the tropics as pristine forests are cleared. Fragments stranded within cities are especially stress-prone due to their greatly altered environment and high human impacts. We review biodiversity and ecological studies from Bukit Timah, a tropical forest fragment in Singapore, to ask how this forest has contributed to our understanding of tropical ecology and fragmentation effects, and list the conservation values of this forest. Evidence from Amazonian fragments predicts that losses in diversity and forest function follow fragmentation, and although Bukit Timah has adhered to some of those predictions, other aspects of the forest appeared remarkably resilient. As might be expected, declines in plant, invertebrate, bird, and mammal diversity occurred not only historically but also across two surveys made about 20 years apart. In other ways Bukit Timah proved surprising. Aboveground biomass fluctuated but did not plummet drastically, and was comparable to levels found in primary forests in the region. The extirpation of large fauna did not appear to reduce the dispersal of large seeded plant species, likely due to continued dispersal by small-mammals and birds. Exotic tree species are confined to recovering secondary forest fringes and do not threaten the primary forest, except for perhaps shade tolerant Pará rubber and a handful of cultivated fruit trees. Studies of birds and plants found that life history differences could account for differences in genetic connectivity or isolation for different species, with population genetic implications for other taxa. Despite being a small fragment, new species of plants and animals continue to be discovered or re-discovered. Clearly, there are reasons to celebrate Bukit Timah as a forest fragment that withstood two centuries of human impacts. Nonetheless, many measures can be implemented to better secure its future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic forest is a highly threatened biodiversity hotspot, harboring one of the highest levels of amphibian species richness in the world. Amphibian conservation in Neotropical biomes is critical because freshwater ecosystems typically experience sharp declines in biodiversity before much is known about species that depend on those environments. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a new approach for monitoring aquatic organisms and provides valuable information on species occurrence in freshwater ecosystems. Here, we assess community diversity in Neotropical streams using eDNA metabarcoding. We compare data from a five-year traditional field survey with results from a short-term eDNA analysis in four streams of the Atlantic forest of southeastern Brazil. We recorded 19 species over 5 years using visual-acoustic methods, of which 10 species are associated with the streams during at least one life stage (egg, tadpole or post-metamorphic). We were able to detect nine of the latter species using eDNA metabarcoding from water samples collected over 4 days. Amphibian community composition as measured by both methods showed high similarity in three streams, but was not perfect, as eDNA failed to detect known species in a fourth stream. Furthermore, in one stream we detected through eDNA metabarcoding a species (Aplastodiscus eugenioi) found only once during the 5-year traditional survey in that stream. Also, three species (Cycloramphus boraceiensis, Hylodes asper, and Hylodes phyllodes) with the highest dependence on aquatic habitat showed the highest number of positive PCR detections on eDNA samples. Our results showed that eDNA metabarcoding can be a useful tool to assess community diversity in tropical streams, and although not perfect in detection, this method can potentially improve our ability to conserve Neotropical amphibians. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Several small habitat patches typically contain more species than a single large patch of comparable area. This pattern has fueled controversy over reserve design (the SLOSS debate); yet its causes remain poorly understood, limiting discussion of any broader biodiversity implications. Using 44 published faunal metacommunity datasets from fragments, islands and habitat islands, we test four hypotheses to explain differences in species richness (SRd) between several small patches and a single large patch: (i) beta diversity (BD); (ii) evenness of species abundance distributions (EV); (iii) size bias in sampling efficiency (SE); and (iv) taxonomy. We used individual-based null models and confirmatory path analysis to compare direct and indirect support for these non-exclusive hypotheses. Broad taxonomic grouping (invertebrates > birds = non-volant vertebrates) accounted for most of the variation in SRd, while BD, EV and SE had smaller, but comparable, direct effects (standardized coefficients = 0.42, 0.31 and −0.26 respectively). Within a taxonomic group, larger SRd occurred when both BD and EV increase. Although sampling bias probably overstates the difference in SRd, it does not explain the pattern. Beyond reserve design, the SLOSS pattern implies potential principles for managing biodiversity in fragmented landscapes. Whether this pattern should inform conservation requires greater understanding. We confirm beta diversity is the major contributor, but it is mediated by increases and decreases in evenness among small patches. Attention to how sub-division alters relative abundances (e.g., by biotic relaxation or altering competitive outcomes) might help clarify how the SLOSS pattern arises. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Small-scale fisheries can greatly impact threatened marine fauna. Peru's small-scale elasmobranch gillnet fishery captures thousands of sharks and rays each year, and incidentally captures sea turtles, marine mammals and seabirds. We assessed the ability of a dedicated fisheries remote electronic monitoring (REM) camera to identify and quantify captures in this fishery by comparing its performance to on-board observer reports. Cameras were installed across five boats with a total of 228 fishing sets monitored. Of these, 169 sets also had on-board fisheries observers present. The cameras were shown to be an effective tool for identifying catch, with > 90% detection rates for 9 of 12 species of elasmobranchs caught. Detection rates of incidental catch were more variable (sea turtle = 50%; cetacean = 80%; pinniped = 100%). The ability to quantify target catch from camera imagery degraded for fish quantities exceeding 15 individuals. Cameras were more effective at quantifying rays than sharks for small catch quantities (x ≤ 15 fish), whereas size affected camera performance for large catches (x > 15 fish). Our study showed REM to be effective in detecting and quantifying elasmobranch target catch and pinniped bycatch in Peru's small-scale fishery, but not, without modification, in detecting and quantifying sea turtle and cetacean bycatch. We showed REM can provide a time- and cost-effective method to monitor target catch in small-scale fisheries and can be used to overcome some deficiencies in observer reports. With modifications to the camera specifications, we expect performance to improve for all target catch and bycatch species. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {Understanding causes of population change is critical for conservation. Quantifying these causes can be difficult, especially for hard to sample animals like marine vertebrates (e.g. pinnipeds). One solution is to investigate spatiotemporal differences in a species' body condition by measuring body size and mass. Collecting traditional morphological measurements is risky and labour intensive, making less invasive and more efficient techniques desirable. Using Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea) of known size and mass as a case study, we tested the suitability of using drone-derived photogrammetry to estimate morphological measurements and assess body condition. Drone-derived measurements were precise and without bias. Animal mass was highly correlated with the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional measurements of simplified area and volume, explaining >77% and >84% (all P <.01) of the variation in mass, depending on the age-sex class. The juvenile class exhibited the strongest associations (both 2D and 3D R2 > 0.99). Using each measurement as a proxy for mass, we calculated body condition indices for each class by standardising the variables by animal length. Photogrammetric indices ranked individuals comparably to those generated from ground-collected data (rs = 0.77–1, depending on age-sex class). Our technique provides a workflow for the non-invasive collection of morphometric data to quantify animal condition, which is transferrable to other pinniped species with species-specific calibration. It will also facilitate the efficient collection of morphometric data of vertebrates from remotely sensed imagery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Large areas of tropical forest have been designated for timber production but logging practices vary widely. Reduced-impact logging is considered best practice and third-party certification aims to ensure that strict standards are met. This includes minimizing the number of roads constructed, avoiding sensitive areas and strictly regulating hunting. Large scale camera trap grids were utilized in Guatemala and Peru to evaluate the impact of reduced-impact logging in certified concessions upon the large and medium-sized mammal fauna with special emphasis on jaguars (Panthera onca). Spatial capture-recapture models showed that jaguar density in Peru (4.54 ± 0.83 ind. 100 km−2) was significantly higher than in Guatemala (1.52 ± 0.34 ind. 100 km−2) but in both regions, densities were comparable to protected areas. Camera traps detected 22 species of large and medium sized mammals in Guatemala and 27 in Peru and a multi-species occupancy model revealed that logging had no negative impact on any of the species studied and actually had an initial positive impact on several herbivore species. We found no avoidance of logging roads; in fact, many species, especially carnivores, frequently used logging roads as movement corridors. Our results indicate that well-managed logging concessions can maintain important populations of large and medium-sized mammals including large herbivores and large carnivores as long as hunting is controlled and timber volumes extracted are low. Responsible forest management would therefore be an ideal activity in the buffer zones and multiple use zones of protected areas creating much less impact and conflict than alternatives such as agriculture or cattle ranching while still providing economic opportunities. Logging concessions can also play an important role in maintaining landscape connectivity between protected areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

We investigated the overlap between suitable habitat for wildlife species of conservation concern and the location of public and private highly protected areas to assess the degree to which current highly protected areas are providing fine-scale habitat for wildlife species of conservation concern, to explore the relationship between the size of total suitable habitat of a species and its vulnerability to extinction, and to identify the species that are poorly represented in highly protected areas and determine where their habitats overlap—i.e., where future protected areas may best be located. We found that nearly one third of terrestrial wildlife species in the contiguous U.S. are vulnerable to extinction and that even though there is a relationship between total suitable habitat area and vulnerability, we find that synthetic indices of endemism and rarity-weighted richness are not necessarily good indicators of whether a species will be of conservation concern. Of all 537 wildlife species of conservation concern, only 62 (11%) are well represented in highly protected areas. To increase representation of habitats of wildlife species of conservation concern, scientists and managers should look to preserve lands where there is the greatest overlap among habitats for species of concern that are currently poorly represented in the reserve system, with special focus on species with small ranges on public lands. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Land trusts play an increasingly important role in conservation both in terms of the magnitude of conservation activities in which they participate and the total proportion of all conservation that they represent. Making informed conservation management decisions and local community engagement are two critical problems facing operators of locally-owned protected areas including those managed by land trusts. Engaging volunteers for critical management needs, such as collecting ecological data, is one way to overcome the challenge of managing and monitoring resources as a small organization. Partnering with volunteers can also help achieve other conservation goals including educational outreach and increasing public support. Land trusts that engage in volunteer-based monitoring (VBM) provide an opportunity to study how citizen science activities can contribute to conservation in practice. We surveyed land trust organizations across the United States to learn about their VBM programs. We received survey responses 332 organization, 133 of which maintain VBM programs. We found that the majority of land trusts with VBM programs are small organizations with less than ten employees (79.1%), few volunteers (50.4% with < 10 volunteers, 87.2% with < 50 volunteers), and little funding dedicated to the volunteer management (70.9% with <$1000 annually). Volunteers collect data on a wide variety of monitoring targets including vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant species, as well as water, soil and air quality measurements. Volunteers also engage in many different stages of the monitoring process including data collection, entry and analysis, and even dissemination of results. While increasing civic engagement and educational outreach were reported as the most important motivations for land trusts to engage in VBM, organizations reported that increasing civic engagement is the most difficult benefit to achieve. These results have implications for how land trusts can use citizen science and other participatory approaches to engage volunteers for conservation actions and increase public engagement. This study also shows that scientists interested in citizen science may engage with land trusts to learn about the potential for citizen science to improve conservation management. © 2016},

	abstract = {Habitat loss is the main threat to biodiversity conservation worldwide, deteriorating areas with remnant suitable habitat and thus reducing species distribution ranges, and increasing the risk of local and regional population extirpations. We used ecological niche models projected as species potential distributions of endemic terrestrial vertebrates and quantified spatiotemporal cumulative habitat loss trajectories projected in species extant distributions, using land use and land cover vegetation maps (LULC) time series (1985, 1993, 2002, 2007, 2011, and 2014). Of a total of 996 species, only 311 species produced robust species potential distribution models. Significant differences in habitat loss in species extant distributions were observed from 1985 to 2002, which coincided with high national habitat loss rates. No significant differences were observed in the following LULC time series. According to the IUCN Red List, only 78 of our species are at risk. However, IUCN's criterion A only considers habitat loss in species extant distributions over the last 10 years, but if we consider the cumulative habitat loss from 1985 to 2014, 227 species lost >30% of their distribution. Thus, we suggest that the impact of cumulative habitat loss in species distributions should be considered when determining conservation threats. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact at each of Mexico's ecoregions, and found that habitat loss in species extant distributions appeared to be related to geographic locations of species distribution ranges rather than to the distribution area per se. Thus, we consider that assessing extinction risks at a local level is critical for future biodiversity conservation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Barriers to animal movement can isolate populations, impacting their genetic diversity, susceptibility to disease, and access to resources. Barriers to movement may be caused by artificial light, which is known to disrupt bird, sea turtle, and bat behavior, but few studies have experimentally investigated the effects of artificial light on movement for a suite of terrestrial vertebrates. Therefore, we studied the effect of ecological light pollution on animal usage of a bridge under-road passage structure. On a weekly basis, sections of the structure were subjected to different light treatments including no light added, followed by a Reference period when lights were off in all the structure sections. Sand track data revealed use by 23 mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, nine of which had >. 30 tracks for species-level analysis. Columbia black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) traversed under unlit bridge sections much less when neighboring sections were lit compared to when none were, suggesting avoidance due to any nearby presence of artificial light. Similarly, deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and opossum (Didelphis virginiana) track paths were less frequent in the lit sections than the ambient. Crossing was correlated with temporal or spatial factors but not light for three of the other species. These findings suggest that artificial light may be reducing habitat connectivity for some species though not providing a strong barrier for others. Such information is needed to inform mitigation of habitat fragmentation in the face of expanding urbanization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Land-use change and intensification in tropical rainforest regions is generally linked to a loss in species diversity that especially affects forest-dependent species. Indonesia is currently the country with the highest deforestation rates worldwide with potentially devastating effects on its diverse and highly endemic flora and fauna. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of the varied effects of forest conversion and land-use intensification on vascular plant diversity across the four dominant land-use systems in the lowlands of Sumatra: rainforest, jungle rubber agroforest, rubber plantations, and oil palm plantations. We conducted plot-based species inventories in Jambi Province and assessed a total of 156,006 individuals and 1382 plant species. Forest had the highest levels of alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, followed by jungle rubber. Plant communities in oil palm plantations were characterized by a high density of herbaceous weeds, but low species numbers and low beta diversity. Species numbers were comparable in oil palm and rubber plantations, but the latter showed slightly higher beta diversity. Forest had a clearly distinct floristic composition while the floristic composition of the other systems - and especially the two plantation systems - converged. Alien species were almost completely absent from forest, but the number and relative abundance of alien species increased with increasing land-use intensity and was highest in oil palm plantations where 25% of the species and 62% of the individuals belonged to alien species. Our results represent a first quantitative baseline for how forest conversion in Southeast Asia causes loss in species richness, changes in floristic composition and vegetation structure, as well as a shift from native to alien-dominated plant communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Effectively controlling invasive species on islands is a critical aspect of global conservation. Having the potential to outcompete or consume native species, it is particularly important to remove them from islands harbouring unique flora and fauna. Lord Howe Island, a World Heritage listed area to the east of the Australian mainland, is in the midst of a long-term weed management project, where the most prolific invasive species is cherry guava, with over 700,000 plants removed so far. In such projects, it is critical to have a good understanding of the invasion dynamics and removal process to have reliable estimates of project timeline and success, and to ensure the best removal strategies are being utilised. In this paper we model cherry guava growth, spread and removal on Lord Howe Island, fitting our model to 12 years of removal data. Our mean estimate is that there are 102,091 plants remaining on the island, which will take approximately 25 years to remove at current levels of eradication effort. Altering the strategy to search every year, rather than biennially, reduces the eradication time to 20 years, which falls within the project target, while also decreasing the total search effort. However, simply increasing search effort to finish faster actually increases the total eradication effort. This shows that the benefits of making careful adjustments to a strategy can far out-weight the benefit of simply investing more money into control. This project exemplifies how high-quality removal record-keeping can be used to generate models that provide important long-term forecasts of project success and suggest effective strategic improvements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Sea ice dominates marine ecosystems in the Arctic, and recent reductions in sea ice may alter food webs throughout the region. Sea ice loss may also stress Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens), which feed on benthic macroinvertebrates in the Bering and Chukchi seas. However, no studies have examined the effects of sea ice on foraging Pacific walrus space use patterns. We tested a series of hypotheses that examined walrus foraging resource selection as a function of proximity to resting substrates and prey biomass. We quantified walrus prey biomass with 17 benthic invertebrate families, which included bivalves, polychaetes, amphipods, tunicates, and sipunculids. We included covariates for distance to sea ice and distance to land, and systematically developed a series of candidate models to examine interactions among benthic prey biomass and resting substrates. We ranked candidate models with Bayesian Information Criterion and made inferences on walrus resource selection based on the top-ranked model. Based on the top model, biomass of the bivalve family Tellinidae, distance to ice, distance to land, and the interaction of distances to ice and land all positively influenced walrus foraging resource selection. Standardized model coefficients indicated that distance to ice explained the most variation in walrus foraging resource selection followed by Tellinidae biomass. Distance to land and the interaction of distances to ice and land accounted for similar levels of variation. Tellinidae biomass likely represented an index of overall bivalve biomass, indicating walruses focused foraging in areas with elevated levels of bivalve and tellinid biomass. Our results also emphasize the importance of sea ice to walruses. Projected sea ice loss will increase the duration of the open water season in the Chukchi Sea, altering the spatial distribution of resting sites relative to current foraging areas and possibly affecting the spatial structure of benthic communities. © 2016},

	abstract = {Understanding patterns of species diversity at different spatial scales is important for adapting management and conservation efforts. We have therefore studied wild bee and wasp (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) diversity structure in forest landscapes and evaluated the importance of conservation management at the local and landscape levels. Surveys were conducted at 32 clearcuts in eight landscapes in a managed boreal forest region. We assessed the influence of local habitat and landscape composition on species richness patterns and the effect of prescribed burning and landscape affinity on species composition for all bees and wasps as well as ecological and functional groups. The relative contribution of alpha and beta diversity on the regional level was assessed by diversity partitioning and the beta diversity between landscapes further partitioned into components of species turnover and nestedness. Bee and wasp species richness increased with high flower richness and clearcut size, and species composition differed between burned and unburned sites. Thus, flower-rich early-successional sites in boreal forest landscapes are important habitats for wild bees and wasps. To support this fauna, openness should be maintained for extended periods by delaying or avoiding tree plantation at flower-rich spots on clear-cuts. Beta diversity between landscapes accounted for the greatest proportion of the total regional gamma diversity, and over 70% of this diversity was due to species turnover. This implies that in order to maintain regional diversity, conservation efforts should be spatially dispersed, i.e. applied to every landscape of a few hundred square kilometers and adapted to the local species assemblages. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is a major conservation priority to ensure that projected expansion of oil palm in Africa and Latin America does not lead to analogous environmental devastation in these mega-diverse places. In an effort to minimize negative impacts from a species conservation perspective, we present a framework for spatial planning that accommodates inevitable oil palm expansion into regions of high biodiversity. Using megadiverse Colombia as an example, we investigated current and projected impacts of oil palm on threatened vertebrates (birds, mammals, and amphibians). We highlight a few areas where expansion would be detrimental to threatened fauna and should be avoided, but generally, there is minimal overlap between suitable areas for oil palm production and threatened vertebrate distributions. Our analysis demonstrates that there is room for oil palm to expand in Colombia without incurring severe conservation risks for threatened vertebrates, so long as it avoids a few high-priority areas such as la Serranía de la Macarena, the Andes-Amazon transition, the Darién, and the Tumaco forests. By applying this approach to other countries facing imminent oil palm expansion, it may be possible to meet a growing commodity demand without severely exacerbating the biodiversity crisis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {All ecosystems are dotted by salient small natural features that not only characterize them but also significantly add to their biodiversity and functions. These small natural features are prominent but easily missed when ecosystems are described. Caves are one key example of this. Cave ecosystems are underrepresented in conservation planning and implementation around the world and have become mostly overlooked in conservation strategies overall. Caves contain high levels of biodiversity from fungi to invertebrates to vertebrates. This paper emphasizes bat caves as providers of ecosystem services to vast areas surrounding them, in the order of hundreds of thousands of square km just in North America. Their influence extends three-dimensionally via subterraneous water bodies and via the aerial nightly dispersal of the bats that provide a host of services from seed dispersal to pollination to pest control. The examples used focus primarily on free-tailed bats in North America, but the same principles apply to any other cave in the world with significant bat colonies. Caves enjoy protection, legal or actual, in some countries and not in others, and as a result many have suffered damage or been destroyed altogether. Common threats are vandalism, urbanization, and pollution. Many caves are attractive as ecotourism destinations and provide unique opportunities to educate the public about unexpected biodiversity values and ecosystem services. Inventorying caves poses challenges, but efforts are under way to assess caves in need of protection. Incipient cave protection strategies include legal and educational efforts, and management. Although illustrated with bat caves, given the importance of all caves and their precarious status, it is time to call the attention of decision makers about the urgent need to launch a worldwide cave conservation initiative. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Over half of Northeast Atlantic (55%, n = 12 of 22), and two-thirds of Mediterranean (62%, n = 8 of 13) Data Deficient species were predicted to be threatened. When applied to all data-sufficient species, the mean predictive accuracy was 71% and 66% for the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean models, respectively. Overall, Northeast Atlantic Data Deficient species are predicted to be 1.4 times more threatened than data-sufficient species proportionally (39% assessed-threatened, n = 38 of 98), whereas threat levels in the Mediterranean Sea are similarly high for both (65% assessed-threatened, n = 39 of 60 data-sufficient). With the growing availability of vertebrate trait databases, trait-based, categorical prediction of conservation status is a cost-effective approach towards incorporating Data Deficient species into unbiased (i) estimates of lineage-wide extinction rates, (ii) protected species lists, and (iii) Red List Indices, thus preventing poorly-known species from reaching extinction unnoticed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The analysis is based on a database containing 1100 wetland extent time-series records and the method identifies and addresses ecological and biogeographic biases in the dataset. Globally, the natural WET index, excluding human-made wetlands, declined by about 30% on average between 1970 and 2008. Declines varied between regions from about 50% in Europe to about 17% in Oceania over the same period. The WET index fills an important gap in the ecosystem coverage of global biodiversity indicators and can track changes related to a number of current international policy objectives. The same method could be applied to other datasets to create indicators for other ecosystems with incomplete global data. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Growers may be more likely to adopt wildlife-friendly practices if they perceive that beneficial species are present and conservation actions are successful. At the same time, a farm's landscape and regional context may influence whether biodiversity, including wild birds, are likely to provide ecosystem services or disservices. Here, across two Bird Conservation Regions in the western USA, we assessed a feedback loop that links growers' attitudes towards birds, farming practices, and bird assemblages' hypothesized impacts. To do so, we paired a grower questionnaire survey, bird point count surveys, and farm management and landscape classifications. We found that growers generally exhibited more positive attitudes towards raptors than songbirds and allies (e.g., flycatchers, woodpeckers, hummingbirds). Attitudes towards raptors were more positive when farms were embedded in more natural landscapes and had greater proportions of nonnative birds. Growers held more positive attitudes towards songbirds and allies related to production (yields, crop quality, insect control) when their farms were in the Northern Pacific Rainforest region and were embedded in more natural landscapes. Growers' attitudes towards songbirds and allies related to disease/infrastructure (food safety, animal disease, building/machinery damage, vertebrate control) were more positive in the Northern Pacific Rainforest region as landscapes became more natural, but these relationships did not hold for Coastal California. However, growers' attitudes towards birds were mostly unrelated to the practices used on the farm. Understanding these feedback loops is crucial to increasing uptake of and retention in conservation programs for rapidly declining farmland bird communities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biodiversity founds ecosystem services which guarantee human survival and wellbeing. Halt biodiversity loss requires efficient conservation actions, and the establishment of protected areas is a crucial strategy. However, their planning is still hindered by shortfalls of data, particularly in neglected regions such as Caatinga, a Brazilian biome dominated by tropical dry forests. We used global range maps of tetrapods and local environmental information to mapping species' Area of Habitat (AOH) and support conservation assessment and spatial prioritization in Caatinga. We quantified biodiversity's representation in current protected areas (PAs) and indigenous lands (ILs), as well in priority areas (PRIs) proposed by government for future conservation. Following international targets for 2020 and 2030, we presented a prioritization solution to protect 17% and 30% of biome. PAs and ILs, covering 9.1% of the Caatinga, represent on average 9.8% of species' AOH, with 37 gap species. By protecting 15.3–32.0% of biome, PRIs networks might increase the current mean to 15.2%–37.5% of species' AOH, still resulting in gap species. Our solution represents on average 26.8–42.5% of species' AOH, with no gap species, and effectively represent more than 91% of tetrapods at higher risk. Opportunity costs displaced priorities to areas less affected by human activities, mainly reducing threatened species' representation. Optimized use of available data, including global maps refined by local information, help to support efficient conservation planning. Once that improve the conservation benefits becomes urgent nowadays, when science-based initiatives are under attack, our approach might contribute to other vulnerable and poorly known biomes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Through collation of global, national and state/territory threatened species lists, we conclude that 100 Australian endemic species (one protist, 38 vascular plants, ten invertebrates, one fish, four frogs, three reptiles, nine birds and 34 mammals) are validly listed as extinct (or extinct in the wild) since the nation's colonisation by Europeans in 1788. This tally represents about 6–10% of the world's post-1500 recognised extinctions. The actual number of extinctions is likely to be far more than those recognised in formal lists. Mammals have suffered the highest proportional rate of extinction (ca. 10% of the endemic mammal fauna). There are four main distributional features of these extinctions: (i) consistent with global patterns, island endemic species are disproportionately represented; (ii) many non-island extinct species had highly restricted mainland ranges; but conversely (iii) many extinct mammals had extensive ranges; and (iv) there have been no recognised extinctions of species confined to Australia's mainland monsoonal tropics. Extinctions have occurred largely continuously since Australia's European settlement, with at least three extinctions in the last decade. Mammal extinctions were caused mainly by introduced predators; plant extinctions by habitat loss; frog extinctions by disease; reptile extinctions by an introduced snake; and invertebrate extinctions by a range of anthropogenic processes. Causality has changed over time, with recent extinctions more likely to be associated with disease, introduced reptiles and introduced fish and less likely to be associated with hunting and introduced mammalian predators. The most recent extinction is the sole case for which climate change was a major factor. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Governments and industries increasingly use offsets to compensate for the unavoidable impacts of development on biodiversity. However, high uncertainty about the biodiversity outcomes of offsetting strategies has led to significant criticism in the academic and policy literature, while the ad-hoc application of offset rules within a region may lead to offsets favouring some species and communities at the expense of others. Here we explored opportunities to improve offsetting outcomes through strategic regional offset approaches, underpinned by concepts of complementarity and irreplaceability from the conservation planning literature, in comparison to more commonly used like-for-like approach. We assessed different offsetting strategies in the Hunter Valley, NSW, a rapidly developing region in Australia with an active mining industry. We quantified regional-level biodiversity losses arising from minimal to extensive mining expansion, along with species-specific impacts for 569 flora and fauna species, and prioritized areas for protection, restoration or both to offset the anticipated losses. Accounting for how well the offsets would complement existing protected areas, we compared the area needed for offsetting and the expected biodiversity outcomes among the different strategies. Our results highlight the benefits of a more systematic approach to offsetting in terms of an enhanced understanding of regional-scale impacts, more efficient identification of offset sites and improved biodiversity outcomes. Our approach encourages forward thinking about impending threats to, and opportunities for, biodiversity conservation and could serve as a template for strategic regional offset planning based on plausible scenarios of future biodiversity loss. © 2015 The Authors.},

We evaluated eDNA metabarcoding for monitoring semi-aquatic and terrestrial mammals, specifically nine species of conservation or management concern, and examined spatiotemporal variation in mammal eDNA signals. We hypothesised eDNA signals would be stronger for semi-aquatic than terrestrial mammals, and at sites where individuals exhibited behaviours. In captivity, we sampled waterbodies at points where behaviours were observed (‘directed’ sampling) and at equidistant intervals along the shoreline (‘stratified’ sampling). We surveyed natural ponds (N = 6) where focal species were present using stratified water sampling, camera traps, and field signs. eDNA samples were metabarcoded using vertebrate-specific primers. All focal species were detected in captivity. eDNA signal strength did not differ between directed and stratified samples across or within species, between semi-aquatic or terrestrial species, or according to behaviours. eDNA was evenly distributed in artificial waterbodies, but unevenly distributed in natural ponds. Survey methods deployed at natural ponds shared three species detections. Metabarcoding missed badger and red fox recorded by cameras and field signs, but detected small mammals these tools overlooked, e.g. water vole. Terrestrial mammal eDNA signals were weaker and detected less frequently than semi-aquatic mammal eDNA signals. eDNA metabarcoding could enhance mammal monitoring through large-scale, multi-species distribution assessment for priority and difficult to survey species, and provide early indication of range expansions or contractions. However, eDNA surveys need high spatiotemporal resolution and metabarcoding biases require further investigation before routine implementation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This estimated that the kelp biome occupied 1,469,900 km2 and was present on 22% of the world's coastline. While average sea surface temperature was the most important environmental variable for the biome across all species, wave height, distance from the coast and minimum temperature were of most importance for individual species. This map can be used in planning where marine reserves should be best located, modelling the effects of climate change, and in estimating the blue (ocean) carbon storage.

	abstract = {Conservation often focuses on “critical habitat” including areas important for the reproduction of threatened taxa. As for many aquatic species a priority of shark conservation is the protection of nurseries, yet few countries can support the costly fieldwork required to identify these according to strict criteria. Alternative approaches are therefore required where resource, capacity and security constraints exist. This study collates low-resolution data from alternative, remotely collected and inexpensive existing sources (fish market surveys, literature, museums, anecdotal accounts), to evaluate a possible nursery for the regionally Endangered bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) in the Tigris-Euphrates system and adjacent northwestern Persian/Arabian Gulf (Iraq, Iran, Kuwait), a data-poor area long characterised by conflict and inaccessibility. Evidence is presented that aligns with two of the three nursery definition criteria (abundance and repeated use), along with other data supporting known C. leucas reproductive behaviour. While the necessarily low resolution data cannot answer the full suite of strict nursery criteria nor identify precise nursery locations, they nevertheless collectively provide compelling evidence for a broad area of importance to young and juvenile C. leucas. This area is both highly threatened (e.g. by damming, climate change, fisheries) and of potential major significance, given the apparent absence of similar estuary habitat for thousands of kilometres of arid northwestern Indian Ocean coast. The inexpensive desk-based approach to identifying critical habitat provides another toolkit option for conservationists and could best be applied to distinctive threatened aquatic taxa, especially in the developing world where conservation is often resource-limited. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Large areas of habitat are being fenced globally to restore and relocate species that can no longer survive in their surrounding landscapes, such as because of introduced predators. Despite their promise, the contributions of fenced and intensively-managed reserves towards achieving wider biodiversity goals are contentious. There has been little empirical evidence that fenced reserves can restore communities or ecological function over larger landscapes in ways that justify their large economic and sometimes social costs. Here we tested whether the exclusion of introduced predators restored mammal-sensitive habitat after 8 years within a mainland fenced reserve in southern New Zealand. We also asked whether the abundance of bird-dispersed fruiting trees and frugivorous birds was elevated immediately outside the reserve as compared with the broader landscape. We found that only saplings of fleshy-fruited tree species sensitive to browsing and seed predation by introduced mammals increased over time within the reserve. These mammal-sensitive trees were also more abundant in the surrounding unfenced landscape when close to the reserve, i.e. within 500 m. Our results suggested that mammal-sensitive trees were benefitting from increased fruit dispersal that was spilling over the fenced boundary as mammal-sensitive frugivores responded to predator control. Using point count surveys at 278 unique sites throughout the broader region, we found that the native frugivore community that evolved in the absence of mammalian predators was a third more abundant within the reserve and immediately outside the fenced boundary than at sites 20 km away in the surrounding landscape. Non-endemic frugivores did not show the same spatial pattern. Our work provides among the first evidence that an intensively-managed wildlife reserve can measurably restore populations of threatened flora and fauna and disperse conservation benefits into wider landscapes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) prohibits commercial trans-national trade in pangolin specimens. However, African pangolins are continually trafficked to Asia for traditional medicine, with Nigeria considered a key hub. Using reported Nigeria-linked pangolin seizure data and interviews with Nigerian law enforcement officials, we a) characterised Nigeria's involvement in global pangolin trafficking January 2010–September 2021, particularly observing trafficking trends after pangolin's CITES Appendix I listing; b) estimated the minimum number of pangolins whose scales are in Nigeria-linked seizures January 2010–September 2021, and; c) assessed ongoing efforts within Nigeria to curb pangolin trafficking. Nigeria-linked seizures involved 190,407 kg of pangolin derivatives (99.9% scales) from a minimum of 799,343 pangolins (95% confidence interval; 625,944-996,353) of four species (see caveats in Methods). All shipments confiscated in transit were destined for Asia, with a rapid increase in the mass of maritime shipments over time. Furthermore, stockpiling of pangolin derivatives for overseas shipment is perhaps a prominent trafficking model in Nigeria. Nigeria's law enforcement efforts improved from 2017, the same year Nigeria apparently began playing a hub role. The impact of pangolin's CITES Appendix I listing on pangolin trafficking was unclear, as the marked rise in seizures from 2017 when the listing became effective, coincided with improvements in Nigerian law enforcement efforts. COVID-19–induced travel restrictions likely reduced trafficking activities in 2020 but activities may have fully resumed in 2021. This study provides new information to inform effective enforcement and policy formulation efforts to protect African pangolins. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Feral cats (Felis catus) have devastated wildlife globally. In Australia, feral cats are implicated in most recent mammal extinctions and continue to threaten native species. Cat control is a high-profile priority for Australian policy, research and management. To develop the evidence-base to support this priority, we first review information on cat presence/absence on Australian islands and mainland cat-proof exclosures, finding that cats occur across >99.8% of Australia's land area. Next, we collate 91 site-based feral cat density estimates in Australia and examine the influence of environmental and geographic influences on density. We extrapolate from this analysis to estimate that the feral cat population in natural environments fluctuates between 1.4 million (95% confidence interval: 1.0–2.3 million) after continent-wide droughts, to 5.6 million (95% CI: 2.5–11 million) after extensive wet periods. We estimate another 0.7 million feral cats occur in Australia's highly modified environments (urban areas, rubbish dumps, intensive farms). Feral cat densities are higher on small islands than the mainland, but similar inside and outside conservation land. Mainland cats reach highest densities in arid/semi-arid areas after wet periods. Regional variation in cat densities corresponds closely with attrition rates for native mammal fauna. The overall population estimate for Australia's feral cats (in natural and highly modified environments), fluctuating between 2.1 and 6.3 million, is lower than previous estimates, and Australian feral cat densities are lower than reported for North America and Europe. Nevertheless, cats inflict severe impacts on Australian fauna, reflecting the sensitivity of Australia's native species to cats and reinforcing that policy, research and management to reduce their impacts is critical. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Feral cats have been responsible, in part, for the extinction of many species of mammal, bird and reptile globally, especially on islands. Whilst there is extensive evidence of the predatory impacts of cats on mammals and birds, far less is known about their ecological impacts on reptiles, especially in continental situations. We conducted a field experiment to evaluate the impact of feral cats on terrestrial vertebrates in tropical savanna environments of northern Australia. Three experimental treatments were applied to six 64 ha plots to compare and contrast responses of reptile abundance and species richness to predator exclusion and the additive effects of frequent fire. Replicated pitfall-trapping was undertaken in each plot on seven sampling occasions between November 2013 and November 2015. We analysed relative abundance and species richness data using generalized linear mixed models. There was a significant increase in the abundance of reptiles over a two year period in cat-excluded plots with reptile abundance increasing at twice the rate in cat-exclusion plots compared with cat-accessible plots and there was an additive effect of time-since-fire. Cat exclusion had a positive effect on reptile species richness over time, however the evidence for this pattern was weak when seasonal variation was taken into account. Predation by cats, in synergy with other disturbance processes, could adversely impact reptile species and communities elsewhere in the world where feral cats have been established and warrants further investigation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, we developed a distribution database of threatened terrestrial vertebrates in China, then explored the patterns of the threatened terrestrial vertebrates and evaluated the effectiveness of current nature reserves in terms of their conservation, further identified the conservation priorities for these species in China. We found 452 threatened terrestrial vertebrates widely distributed across China, especially in mountainous and forested regions in southern China. The current nature reserve network is inadequate to capture the threatened vertebrate species. The nature reserves were found to cover 30.47% of the hotspots and 38.65% of the ranges of these species on average, with quite a few conservation hotspot and species gaps. We further propose to either systematically plan and fix current nature reserves or add new protected areas in Yunnan Province and mountainous regions in southeast China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {International trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity conservation. CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, is the primary mechanism for maintaining sustainability in international wildlife trade. Although a comparatively well-designed legal instrument, CITES has been criticised because of its emphasis on regulatory measures and disregard for the economic reality of wildlife trade. Through means of a case study on the trade in pangolins (Pholidota: Manidae) in Asia, we evaluate the CITES approach to controlling trade and demonstrate significant areas to be addressed. These arise because CITES fails to accurately monitor supply, particularly where trade is illegal, it fails to consider the impact of trade controls in realistic terms, and it does little to consider the complex nature of demand or contend with changing market dynamics. To more effectively manage trade we argue that reforms are needed within CITES. Specifically, we highlight improved monitoring of supply (by accounting for illegal and legal trade) and of demand and prices for wildlife (through national wildlife consumption surveys). This information would generate a more holistic understanding of wildlife trade and, if integrated with the Convention's existing trade database, would allow a more realistic evaluation of the performance of trade controls, and could inform decision-making and the implementation of interventions which go beyond regulation and address demand directly. In a world of rapid economic and social change understanding markets and addressing demand as well as supply is essential to conserving the world's trade threatened species. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Restoration plantings are an increasingly common management technique to address habitat loss in agricultural landscapes. Native fauna, including birds, may occupy planted areas of vegetation. However, unless restoration plantings support breeding populations, their effectiveness as a conservation strategy may be limited. We assessed breeding activity of birds in box-gum grassy woodland restoration plantings in the South-west Slopes bioregion of New South Wales, Australia. We compared breeding activity in plantings of different size (1.3–7.7 ha) and shape (linear and block-shaped) to breeding activity in a set of remnant woodland sites. Contrary to expectations, we found that bird breeding activity was greatest per hectare in small patches. This trend was driven by the superb fairywren – the most abundant species in the woodland assemblage. We also found a negative effect of planting age, with younger plantings supporting more breeding activity per hectare. We found no effect of patch type or shape on breeding activity, and that species' relative abundance was not predictive of their degree of breeding activity. Our results highlight the value of small habitat patches in fragmented agricultural landscapes, and indicate that restoration plantings are as valuable as remnant woodland patches for supporting bird breeding activity. We demonstrate the importance of breeding studies for assessing the conservation value of restoration plantings and other habitat patches for avifauna. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The Mexican legal standard (Norma Oficial Mexicana; NOM-ECOL-059-2010) uses four criteria to analyze specieś extinction risk at a national scale. However, when prioritizing areas for biodiversity conservation it is also important to incorporate knowledge of the conservation status of species at a more localized scale (regional, state, or municipal levels) for identifying possible risks associated with population declines. This paper focuses on Guerrero, which is the fourth most biologically diverse state in Mexico. The total extent of the conservation areas in Guerrero is low, amounting to 0.09% of its total area. We analyzed data for 582 terrestrial vertebrate species in Guerrero (53 amphibians, 115 reptiles, 334 birds and 80 mammals), modeling their potential distribution using a maximum entropy algorithm, and 114,555 occurrence records, and 23 predictive environmental (19 climatic and four topographical) variables. The portion of the potential distribution for each species including only remnant natural habitat was designated as its predicted distribution. The area of the predicted distribution was used to compute the fraction of natural habitat remaining for each species overlapping within decreed protected areas at the state and national levels, that is, for Guerrero and all of Mexico. Results show significant differences in the fraction of species' predicted distribution and species' potential distribution at different scales (state and national) and differences between the vertebrate groups analyzed. Because quantitative conservation targets are typically set for individual species, this exercise enables an analysis of the impact of the habitat lost on each species' distribution by assessing the fraction of its predicted distribution that coincides with protected areas. We conclude that this must be part of systematic conservation planning to prioritize areas for potential conservation in Guerrero. © 2015.},

	abstract = {Extensive 1970–2010 deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has generated a ~ 1.5 Mha fragmented region known as the ‘arc of deforestation’. Farmers and cattle ranchers throughout Brazil are legally required to set-aside riparian forest strips within their landholdings, but recent legislative changes have relaxed the minimum mandatory conditions of these riparian forests. In this context, we assessed the functional role of riparian forest remnants as landscape connectors for medium to large-bodied terrestrial mammals in a vast fragmented landscape of southern Amazonia. We selected 38 riparian forest strips and five riparian sites within continuous forest, installed four to five camera-traps along each riparian zone (199 camera-trap stations), and sampled the terrestrial mammal assemblage for 60 days per station during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. We compared mammal use of riparian forests within both continuous and highly fragmented forests, and examined the effects of corridor width, corridor habitat structure, and landscape context on mammal species richness, composition, and functional diversity, all of which were higher in continuous forests than in riparian remnants. Functional diversity differences between corridor type was trait-independent and mediated by differences in species richness. Forest habitat degradation was associated with overall lower species richness, whereas forest specialists were more species-rich in increasingly wider corridors. Compositional shifts indicate that deforestation and forest degradation favours matrix-tolerant species with lower levels of forest habitat specificity. We show the potential landscape connectivity role for forest mammals of riparian corridors, whose width and forest degradation status are key predictors of community-wide responses. We provide evidence on the importance of these relict riparian strips to forest vertebrates, strengthening the scientific arguments that help justify the recently embattled legal requirements to maintain effective riparian corridors in Brazil. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Reducing the rate of species extinctions is one of the great challenges of our time. Understanding patterns in the distribution and frequency of both threatened species and the threatening processes affecting them improves our ability to mitigate threats and prioritize management actions. In this quantitative synthesis of processes threatening Australian at-risk fauna, we find that species are impacted by a median of six threats (range 1–19), though there is considerable variation in numbers of threats among major taxonomic groups. Invasive species, habitat loss, biological resource use, natural systems modification and climate change are the processes most commonly affecting Australian threatened species. We identified an uneven distribution of research knowledge among species, with half of the total number of species-specific peer-reviewed scientific publications associated with only 11 threatened species (2.7%). Furthermore, the number of threats associated with each species was correlated with the research effort for that species, and research effort was correlated with body mass. Hence, there appears to be a research bias towards larger-bodied species, and certain charismatic species, that could result in inferences biased towards these favored species. However, after accounting for these effects we found that for birds, amphibians, reptiles and marine mammals body mass is positively correlated with the number of threats associated with each species. Many threats also co-occur, indicating that threat syndromes may be common. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Mega-hydroelectric dams in lowland Amazonia create large archipelagos of upland forest, yet few studies have taken advantage of these fragmented landscapes to examine the effects of habitat insularization on vertebrate populations. We investigated the effects of insularization on bird species richness and composition at 27 variable-sized islands formed by the Balbina Hydroelectric Reservoir in the central Brazilian Amazon after 25 years of isolation, which were compared to three mainland sites in adjacent continuous forest. Islands were characterized by patch and landscape metrics, and the local avifauna was surveyed at all sites (including 172 sampling points) four times using point counts, and twice using playbacks. Island size was the strongest predictor of species richness and similarity, whereas other metrics showed weak or no effect. On the basis of 61 forest bird species distributed across six foraging guilds, terrestrial omnivores and insectivores, small understorey frugivores and large-bodied trunk frugivore/faunivore comprised the guilds most affected by habitat insularization. Our results demonstrate a striking decline in avifaunal species richness, particularly in islands smaller than 55 ha, which represent ~. 90% of the ~. 3500 islands in the Balbina reservoir. We conclude that other major hydropower reservoirs across the lowland Amazonian basin are likely to experience similarly high avian extinction rates and suggest that the environmental licencing of these impoundments should be reassessed or at least include protected area offsets. © 2016.},

Most of the remaining TDF are in South America, including Brazil's Caatinga. Understanding how the biota of TDFs responds to habitat loss and climate change is a scientific challenge, especially to diversified groups, such as bats, whose richness and ecological roles in TDF are usually underestimated. We updated and synthesized occurrence data and generated distribution models for Caatinga bats considering present and future scenarios. At least 96 species, 48 genera, and eight families were recorded, including two endemic species; five additional species may occur in the biome. The highest potential species richness occurs in the east, in the Caatinga/Atlantic Forest ecotone; the lowest in the west, in the Caatinga/Cerrado ecotone. Current and projected deforestation led to a reduction of 65% in areas with very high potential richness, and only 0.4% will remain within current protected areas. In a business as usual scenario (i.e., high and fast habitat loss + low in situ protection + high potential exposure to climate change) the bat fauna of the Caatinga will be negatively impacted. Improving the conservation of roosting and foraging sites, with the expansion and/or creation of protected areas is urgently needed. © 2018},

	abstract = {Human activities are threatening Borneo's unique biodiversity, but little is known on the status of freshwater invertebrates. We assessed changes in diversity and distribution of freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionida) in northern Borneo, and identified drivers of present distribution and threats. Past distribution data were collected from literature and museum resources. Present distribution data were collected from 21 river basins, and 47 water quality, climatic, landscape and human variables explored as potential predictors of species presence/absence. Species delimitations were identified by morphology and COI barcoding, and haplotype networks generated. Our data indicate that over the past 50 years, four of originally five native species have become very rare or possibly locally extirpated. Since these four species are endemic to Borneo, other Bornean river basins should urgently be surveyed to identify any remaining populations. In the same time span, the non-native Sinanodonta woodiana has become the most widespread freshwater mussel in northern Borneo. The fifth native species was identified as Rectidens sumatrensis and found in four Sarawakian river basins, thus contradicting previous assumptions of an endemic Bornean Rectidens species. Although a number of stable R. sumatrensis populations are retained across Sarawak, the species' strong spatial contraction in mainland Sundaland and apparent low tolerance to eutrophication suggest that it is vulnerable to further habitat alteration. Our results indicate that Borneo's (endemic) freshwater invertebrate biodiversity is declining rapidly. Comprehensive surveys targeting an array of invertebrate and vertebrate taxa are needed to identify Borneo's freshwater biodiversity hotspots, where conservation efforts should be concentrated. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Herein, we provide a comprehensive analyses of historical data as well as fish monitoring data from 1989 through 2013 from Bavaria, Germany. The results of this study indicate that the most pronounced species-turnover already had occurred before the 1990s. Severe loss of species (21 out of 69 species lost until 1990s), decrease in spatial distribution (51 species, 27 reduced to <50% of historical distribution), decrease of abundance, shifts towards potamal species and the establishment of novel communities due to increasing colonization with non-native species was evident. Declines were strongest for gravel-spawning species of the hyporhitral and epipotamal in medium-sized and large rivers (e.g. grayling (Thymallus thymallus), nase (Chondrostoma nasus), barbel (Barbus barbus)), suggesting that effects of increasing water temperatures and increased fine sediment loads probably strongly contribute to the decline of those species. Our results generally confirmed the validity of current conservation status for most species, but also identified species (dace (Leuciscus leuciscus), chub (Squalius cephalus), trout (Salmo trutta), minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus), nase and barbel) and habitats (medium-sized and large rivers) that deserve higher priority in conservation management.

	abstract = {Drought has fueled an increased frequency and severity of large wildfires in many ecosystems. Despite an increase in research on wildfire effects on vertebrates, the vast majority of it has focused on short-term (< 5 years) effects and there is still little information on the time scale of population recovery for species that decline in abundance after fire. In 2003, a large wildfire in Montana (USA) burned the watersheds of four of eight streams that we sampled for larval Rocky Mountain tailed frogs (Ascaphus montanus) in 2001. Surveys during 2004–2005 revealed reduced abundance of larvae in burned streams relative to unburned streams, with greater declines associated with increased fire extent. Rocky Mountain tailed frogs have low vagility and have several unusual life-history traits that could slow population recovery, including an extended larval period (4 years), delayed sexual maturity (6–8 years), and low fecundity (< 50 eggs/year). To determine if abundance remained depressed since the 2003 wildfire, we repeated surveys during 2014–2015 and found relative abundance of larvae in burned and unburned streams had nearly converged to pre-fire conditions within two generations. The negative effects of burn extent on larval abundance weakened > 58% within 12 years after the fire. We also found moderate synchrony among populations in unburned streams and negative spatial autocorrelation among populations in burned streams. We suspect negative spatial autocorrelation among spatially-clustered burned streams reflected increased post-fire patchiness in resources and different rates of local recovery. Our results add to a growing body of work that suggests populations in intact ecosystems tend to be resilient to habitat changes caused by wildfire. Our results also provide important insights into recovery times of populations that have been negatively affected by severe wildfire. © 2017},

	abstract = {Insects as a group are suffering rapid declines in many parts of the world but are also poorly studied relative to vertebrate taxa. Comprehensive assessments of insect declines must account for both detected and undetected species. We studied extirpations among butterflies, a particularly well-known insect group, in the highly developed and biologically well-surveyed island city-state of Singapore. Building on existing butterfly species lists, we collated museum and naturalist records over the last two centuries and used statistical models to estimate the total extirpation rate since the first major collections in 1854. In addition, we compiled a set of traits for each butterfly species and explored how they relate to species discovery and extirpation. With a database of 413 native species, 132 (32%) of which are recorded as extirpated in Singapore, we used a statistical model to infer that, in addition, 104 unknown species (95% CI 60–162) were likely extirpated before they were ever discovered, suggesting a total extirpation rate of 46% (41–51%). In the trait analyses, we found that butterfly species that were discovered later were weakly associated with rarer larval host plants and smaller wingspans, while species that persisted for longer were weakly associated with higher larval host plant abundance and lower forest-dependence. This exercise is one of the first to offer a holistic estimate of extirpations for a group of insects by accounting for undetected extirpations. It suggests that extirpations among insects, specifically in the tropics, may be higher than naïve estimates based only on known records. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Sharks are among the most threatened vertebrates on the planet. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely established and promoted as a shark conservation tool. However, the geographic ranges of most imperiled shark species (endemic and threatened) fall outside the current global networks of MPAs, leaving the protective benefits of this tool questionable for the shark species of highest conservation concern. The Western Cape of South Africa is a hotspot for endemic and threatened shark species. Here, we examined the potential protective benefit of a no-take marine reserve (the De Hoop MPA) for imperiled shark species using baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS). Eleven shark species were documented, with six of 11 species (55%) classified as threatened with extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The composition of the shark assemblage was dominated by small to mid-sized species, including small endemics. Species-specific habitat preferences were identified, with all these habitats represented in the MPA. Frequency of occurrence and relative abundance of sharks on BRUVS were significantly higher inside the De Hoop MPA than outside. Both protected and commercially exploited sharks species exhibited higher relative abundance inside the MPA. Relative abundance also increased inside the MPA with increasing distance from the reserve boundaries. Our findings suggest that no-take MPAs can be an effective tool for protecting shark species of conservation concern, including threatened endemics, particularly if the MPA adequately incorporates their preferred habitats. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Understanding species responses to changes in habitat is a primary focus of biodiversity conservation, especially when assessing widespread anthropogenic disturbance. Extraction of Alberta's subterranean oil sands by wells requires extensive networks of cleared linear disturbances (“in situ” extraction) that result in widespread, but localized increases in early seral habitats. Little is known about biodiversity responses to these disturbances, especially for invertebrates. Here, we investigated how butterflies responded to in situ oil sands developments in the boreal forests of Wood Buffalo region, Alberta, Canada. To assess the magnitude of change associated with different disturbance types, we compared abundance and diversity of butterflies in undisturbed forests with those observed in 3-m and 9-m wide cleared corridors (seismic lines), 60 × 60 m clearings (well pads), and roadside verge habitat. The butterfly assemblage was evaluated based on disturbance type and three measures of landscape change: amount of early seral habitat, edge density, and diversity of natural habitats. Species richness was twice and abundance three-times higher in larger disturbances than in controls, with the narrowest corridors not differing from controls. A model using disturbance type, edge density, and habitat diversity explained 62% of assemblage variation, with the type of disturbance explaining 47%. Higher butterfly abundance and diversity occurred in localized early seral sites, even on 9-m wide corridors, while surrounding landscape characteristics had little effect. Results are consistent with previous studies finding stronger responses in vertebrates to larger disturbances associated with oil sands, confirming that narrower corridors mitigate the effects of oil sands exploration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

However, are we humans aware of this? Through a study conducted on French students in Environmental and Human Sciences, we designed a free-associations test-based game to elucidate whether Insects were a part of animal diversity representations and which Insects were indeed in students' minds. We also looked for perceived values and related knowledge among taxa in order to examine those results with regard to students' socio-demographic characteristics. Besides a known overall negative perception of invertebrates, we found that this perception was correlated to the “human environment” of the person beyond the “exposure to nature” theory: being surrounded by persons actively involved in nature conservation increases positive perception of Insecta. Moreover, invertebrates were less seen as a part of ecosystems than vertebrates; this implies a lack of a holistic vision of diversity, which might be the key to improving insect understanding and conservation. Departing from the depiction of insects from a specific group of participants, we propose a generic framework to enhance awareness for insect conservation and recommendations to improve education initiatives. These baselines could significantly help future conservation strategies as they address the perception challenge of insects. © 2019},

	abstract = {The financial expense of tracking solutions often impedes effective characterisation of habitat use in threatened marine megavertebrates. Yet some of these taxa predictably aggregate at coastal breeding sites, providing conservation opportunities. Toward a low-cost solution for tracking marine megavertebrates, we trial conventional GPS data loggers against Argos satellite transmitters for assessing inter-nesting habitat use of marine turtles. Devices were attached to green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead (Caretta caretta) turtles nesting at a study site in Cyprus, where patrol teams were in place to retrieve GPS loggers from turtles returning to lay subsequent clutches. GPS tracking revealed loggerhead turtles to predominantly use areas outside the boundaries of an MPA proposed for the region, while both species under-used much of the MPA area. Due to high location error, Argos data were considered unsuitable for such fine-scale assessments (all location classes except Z were included in our analysis). However, Argos tracking showed half the loggerhead turtles sampled also nested outside of the patrolled study area, demonstrating connectivity with other proposed MPAs. This was not accounted for by GPS tracking, because females exhibiting this behaviour rarely returned to the study beach, precluding GPS retrieval, thus, demonstrating the power of remote data access. The low-cost GPS technology could be considered in similar cases, where recapture is likely and where funding barriers preclude the use of Argos-relay fast-acquisition GPS technology. In combining the accuracy GPS and the continuity of Argos, the latter provides the best solution in most scenarios, but at far greater cost. © 2018},

Such resources can alter individual foraging behavior of animals, and induce population-wide changes. Yet, little consensus exists about the relative influence of the availabilities of native and human food subsidies to wildlife foraging throughout altered landscapes. We explored this unresolved question by analyzing the effects of landscape factors on American black bear (Ursus americanus) diet across the state of Colorado, USA. We estimated assimilated diet using stable isotope analysis of harvested black bear tissues to determine the contribution of human-derived foods to bear diets throughout Colorado, as well as how increasing reliance on human-derived food subsidies increases the risk of conflict. We found that bears (n = 296) showed strong regional diet variability, but substantial use of human-derived food subsidies in eastern Colorado (> 30% assimilated diet). The age-sex class of the bear and housing density of its harvest location were the most influential predictors of 13C enrichment (a tracer of human food subsidies). Furthermore, foraging on subsidies increased risk of conflict; the odds of being a nuisance bear increased by 60% for each ~ 1‰ increase in δ13C. Our study confirms the efficacy of δ13C as a proxy for human activity, and indicates that while demographic differences play a clear role in the foraging ecology of bears, availability of subsidies coincident with varying levels of human activity appears to be a major driver in predicting black bear diet throughout the western United States. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

While it is well established that the loss of primary forests is devastating, considerably less is understood about the conservation value of sacred forests (e.g. Feng shui woods in China) as local biodiversity reservoirs in human influenced landscapes. When these forests were assessed, the focus was generally on floral diversity, while faunal aspects were neglected. Here we address this knowledge gap by evaluating several dimensions of faunal biodiversity in Hong Kong Feng shui woods. We compare taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional elements of the leaf litter dwelling ant fauna collected over five years among Feng shui woods and two woody habitats corresponding to two distinct successional stages. Ant assemblages in Feng shui woods presented higher species richness that were more resilient to invasions by tramp species, and encompassed specialist species with a distinct set of traits. Phylogenetic diversity was similar in Feng shui and successional woods, while functional diversity was clustered in early successional habitats. The scarcity of tramp species and presence of specialists in Feng shui woods despite their close proximity to human settlements highlights their conservation value for native species in highly degraded landscapes. Our results provide much needed insight on the faunal biodiversity of Feng shui woods. We highlight the conservation value and urgent need for a better protection of these widely overlooked sacred forests in highly disturbed landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

However, limited studies have quantitatively examined the scale of bycatch varying across fishing fleets and areas in regional tuna longline fisheries, as data are often sparse. We used scientific observer data to analyze the discard and bycatch patterns of Chinese tuna longline fleets in the Pacific Ocean by applying general statistical analysis and spatial hotspots analysis. A total of 9971 sets were observed, representing 1.56% of the total efforts. Of 435,156 individuals, 30.4% were recorded as bycatch, and 15.8% were discarded. The majority of bycatch was other bony fishes (15.5%) and sharks (7.3%). Bycatch and discard rates of the bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus, BET) fleet were larger than that of the albacore (Thunnus alalunga, ALB) fleet. The highest bycatch rates of other bony fishes and elasmobranchs most often occurred in the western and central temperate Pacific and the eastern tropical Pacific, respectively. Most marine turtles and mammals were caught by the BET fleet in the Tropical Pacific, and the bycatch of seabirds often occurred in the Temperate Pacific. Low bycatch rates but high discard mortality of marine mammals, turtles, and sea birds were found. Bycatch rates were estimated by fleet, seasons, and areas, with the rates of marine turtles ranging from 0 to 0.024 per 1000 hooks, and those of sea birds ranging from 0 to 0.228 per 1000 hooks. Six bycatch hotspots, identified in this study, should be considered in future management and conservation planning. Implementing measures such as live releasing bycatch, reducing the fishing efforts in the area with high bycatch rate, optimizing monitoring programs, and allocating observers more widely in areas where there is more bycatch are necessary. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Major hydropower infrastructure has become a leading driver of biodiversity loss in the lowland tropics. Terrestrial species typically become stranded in post-isolation land-bridge islands within hydroelectric reservoirs. Understanding the resulting extinction dynamics of insular communities is critical to inform, if not to avert, the ongoing blitzkrieg of dam development. Here we assess the effects of forest patch and landscape metrics on diurnal lizard species richness and composition within the Balbina Hydroelectric Dam and surrounding areas in the Central Brazilian Amazon. This 28-yr-old dam created a reservoir of ~ 4438 km2, comprising 3546 islands. We sampled 25 of these islands (0.83–1466 ha) and five mainland continuous forest sites, one of which placed along stream banks. We further related morpho-ecological traits and the geographic distribution of lizard species to the spatial metrics of islands where they occurred. Using 100 L-pitfall traps operated over 5447 trap-days, we recorded 1123 lizards from 17 taxa, two of which exclusively found along stream banks within continuous forest. Island area was the best predictor of species richness and composition. Small islands (≤ 2 ha) harboured fewer than a third of all species typically observed in larger islands and continuous forest (≥ 8 species), and only islands ≥ 100 ha retained nearly complete lizard faunas. Lizard assemblages inhabiting small, isolated islands consisted almost exclusively of an oversimplified set of widely distributed, large-bodied, habitat generalist, heliophile species associated with open areas and forest edges, and that feed on a wide spectrum of prey sizes. These wholesale changes in lizard community structure were characterized by severe losses in functional traits, and may profoundly affect ecosystem functioning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Global changes require conservation planners to integrate environmental dynamics into their strategies. Forward-looking species-based conservation plans typically use data for a few time periods (ten to thirty years apart) to pinpoint the adaptive areas providing the conditions for species to follow their suitable climates and persist. With such gaps in time, species' responses to environmental conditions between the evaluated periods are not addressed. Here we test whether choices on the temporal resolution in analysis (length of time in between time slices) impact the location and perceived effectiveness of the resulting climate-adaptive areas and the value of established protected areas in providing ground for the spatial responses of species. We address these issues using a conservation exercise set up in Western France, where ten vertebrate species are targeted for persistence in the long term (i.e., 2050). For each species, the area prioritization solutions obtained by using three settings of temporal resolution (annual, decadal and tri-decadal) were largely dissimilar. The climate adaptive areas obtained with annual data defined convoluted adaptive trajectories, largely distinct from the trajectories achieved with decadal and tri-decadal data. This has reflections on the perceived effectiveness of established protected areas in encompassing those adaptive trajectories. In the final stages of planning, conservation planers need to provide rigorous proposals for the establishment of effective conservation actions. This study pinpoints the need for fine-resolute temporal data to reach such effectiveness in the design of climate-proof protected area networks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Long-term biodiversity occurrence records are key to quantify long-term biodiversity patterns and trends and inform the conservation of threatened species, but they are strongly biased in terms of the species represented. This taxonomic bias, and its correlation to societal preferences, is well-identified in modern biodiversity datasets. However, it remains to be investigated, and its basis understood, in long-term occurrence datasets assembled from historical sources. Here we investigate taxonomic bias for 38 species of large terrestrial mammals using a dataset of 780 historical occurrence assembled from 16th to mid-19th century historical written sources in South Africa. We test if this bias is related to species' historical charisma, using a functional definition of non-human charisma, supported by anecdotes from the historical literature. We identify a strong taxonomic bias, with up to several order of magnitudes of difference in the likelihood of reporting between some species. Species' charisma alone explains 75% of the observed variance, the most charismatic species being largely over-reported. This is the first evidence of a positive relationship between taxonomic bias and charisma in a historical biodiversity dataset, within a homogeneous taxonomic group such as large terrestrial mammals. These results improve our understanding of the relationship between people and the large terrestrial fauna in historical times and suggest that species' charisma is a good predictor of taxonomic bias in long-term biodiversity datasets. This provides background for modern conservation by illustrating the durability of the charisma concept and of its relation with taxonomic bias, with implications for the representativeness of species in long-term conservation studies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (. Bd) is notorious amongst current conservation biology challenges, responsible for mass mortality and extinction of amphibian species. World trade in amphibians is implicated in global dissemination. Exports of South African Xenopus laevis have led to establishment of this invasive species on four continents. Bd naturally infects this host in Africa and now occurs in several introduced populations. However, no previous studies have investigated transfer of infection into co-occurring native amphibian faunas. A survey of 27 U.K. institutions maintaining X. laevis for research showed that most laboratories have low-level infection, a risk for native species if animals are released into the wild. RT-PCR assays showed Bd in two introduced U.K. populations of X. laevis, in Wales and Lincolnshire. Laboratory and field studies demonstrated that infection levels increase with stress, especially low temperature. In the U.K., native amphibians may be exposed to intense transmission in spring when they enter ponds to spawn alongside X. laevis that have cold-elevated Bd infections. Exposure to cross-infection has probably been recurrent since the introduction of X. laevis, 20. years in Lincolnshire and 50. years in Wales. These sites provide an important test for assessing the impact of X. laevis on Bd spread. However, RT-PCR assays on 174 native amphibians (. Bufo, Rana, Lissotriton and Triturus spp.), sympatric with the Bd-infected introduced populations, showed no foci of self-sustaining Bd transmission associated with X. laevis. The abundance of these native amphibians suggested no significant negative population-level effect after the decades of co-occurrence. © 2015 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Australia's lizard fauna is among the most diverse in the world. Yet for the continent's vast northern Monsoonal Tropics, recent genomic and morphological evidence indicate that current taxonomy significantly underestimates actual biological diversity. Apparently widespread species typically contain ancient phylogenetic divisions or confounded taxonomic boundaries. Resolving the distributions and relationships across tropical species complexes reveals higher diversity than is recognised taxonomically and may warrant substantial taxonomic changes. For conservation assessments however, we need not wait for revised taxonomy, because phylogenetically informed analyses can use the best available data to inform conservation priorities now, independent of taxonomy. We present results of a large-scale conservation analysis based on comparative phylogeography of ten genera of lizards in two families (Gekkonidae and Scincidae) across the “Top End” of northern Australia, an ecologically and topographically diverse landscape recognised for its high biodiversity and indigenous cultural values. We combine the distributions and phylogeny of evolutionary lineages across multiple species complexes to estimate phylogenetic endemism, a measure of the extent to which evolutionary diversity is geographically concentrated. We demonstrate new methods for conservation assessment to incorporate phylogenetic diversity both within and across species, and for cases where taxonomy is uncertain or incomplete. We identify five hotspots of endemism, some previously known such as the Arnhem Plateau but others that are newly identified such as the Wessel & English Company Islands and the Darwin-Litchfield area. We find that, weighted by range size, the 28% of the region within protected areas holds 44% of the region's sampled phylogenetic diversity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The wildlife pet trade is a billion dollar transnational business that has devastating effects on global biodiversity. Australian parrots are highly sought by overseas collectors due to their uniqueness, however, the characteristics of this demand are poorly understood. We used trade reports to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Trade Database to analyse spatial and temporal trends in live commercial trade of Australian endemic parrots. We also investigated whether the volume of trade is influenced by variables related to species availability and popularity in Australia, and ease of captive breeding. We collected information on over 20,000 transactions for the period 1975–2014. Between the years 2000 and 2005 the volume of trade sharply declined, possibly due to the effect of international bird trade bans as a response to the avian influenza crisis. Australia has a minimal role in the trade of its own endemic parrots, even before the passing of the Australian Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999 that banned the export of native wildlife. Key international exporters are Netherlands (25.8% of all exports) and Belgium (17.5%), and captive breeding is the major source. The USA (7.5% of all imports) and Japan (7.3%) are key importers, and Netherlands, USA and South Africa are also major intermediaries. Species that have larger Australian distributions, and species abundant in Australian private and public captivity, are traded internationally in higher volumes. International trade in Australian endemic parrots is an example of an exotic pet market that is sustainably supplied by overseas captive breeding, while native populations are effectively protected by genuine national trade bans. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {We calculated a Living Planet Index (LPI) for the Netherlands, based on 361 animal species from seven taxonomic groups occurring in terrestrial and freshwater habitats. Our assessment is basically similar to the global LPI, but the latter includes vertebrate species and trends in population abundance only. To achieve inferences on trends in biodiversity more generally, we added two insect groups (butterflies and dragonflies) and added occupancy trends for species for which we had no abundance trends available. According to the LPI, the state of biodiversity has slightly increased from 1990 to 2014. However, large differences exist between habitat types. We found a considerable increase in freshwater animal populations, probably because of improvement of chemical water quality and rehabilitation of marshland habitats. We found no trend in the LPI for woodland populations. In contrast, populations in farmland and open semi-natural habitats (coastal dunes, heathland and semi-natural grassland) declined, which we attribute to intensive agricultural practices and nitrogen deposition, respectively. The LPI shows that, even in a densely populated western European country, ongoing loss of animal biodiversity is not inevitable and may even be reversed if adequate measures are taken. Our approach enabled us to produce summary statistics beyond the level of species groups to monitor the state of biodiversity in a clear and consistent way. © 2016 The Authors},

	abstract = {Australia is a global hotspot of reptile diversity, hosting ~10% of the world's squamate (snake and lizard) species. Yet the conservation status of the Australian squamate fauna has not been assessed for >25 years; a period during which the described fauna has risen by ~40%. Here we provide the first comprehensive conservation assessment of Australian terrestrial squamates using IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. Most (86.4%; n = 819/948) Australian squamates were categorised as Least Concern, 4.5% were Data Deficient, and 7.1% (range 6.8%–11.3%, depending on the treatment of Data Deficient species) were threatened (3.0% Vulnerable, 2.7% Endangered, 1.1% Critically Endangered). This level of threat is low relative to the global average (~18%). One species (Emoia nativitatis) was assessed as Extinct, and two species (Lepidodactylus listeri and Cryptoblepharus egeriae) are considered Extinct in the Wild: all three were endemic to Christmas Island. Most (75.1%) threat assessments were based on geographic range attributes, due to limited data on population trends or relevant proxies. Agriculture, fire, and invasive species were the threats that affected the most species, and there was substantial geographic variation in the number of species affected by each threat. Threatened species richness peaked on islands, in the Southern Alps, and across northern Australia. Data deficiency was greatest in northern Australia and in coastal Queensland. Approximately one-in-five threatened species were not represented in a single protected area. Our analyses shed light on the species, regions, and threats in most urgent need of conservation intervention. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Unsustainable trade in wildlife products both legally and illegally is a leading cause of population declines and increased extinction risk in commercially valuable species. However due to the clandestine nature of illegal trade and paucity of overarching studies of legal trade our understanding on international trade networks is patchy. We develop a gravity–underreporting modelling framework to analyse and compare: (i) data on the legal trade in mammalian, avian and reptilian products from recorded by The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and (ii) to data on the seizures of illegal products entering the USA between 2004 and 2013. We find substantial differences in the factors driving legal trade for the 3 taxonomic groups considered, indicating different drivers for different product markets. Illegal imports for all groups were associated with increasing exporter GDP. We found higher probabilities of underreporting for avian and reptile products, and in general central Africa, central Asia, Eastern Europe and Pacific Island states showed higher underreporting than other regions, indicating the existence of complex trade networks and the potential for the laundering of illegal products through legal markets. Our results show the important regional and economic trends driving wildlife trade. Our new modelling framework can also help illuminate previously unseen aspects of illegal and legal wildlife trade, which can help with the implementation of interventions to curb the impact of trade on wild populations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recent global changes have triggered a biodiversity crisis. However, climate fluctuations have always influenced biodiversity and humans have affected species distributions since prehistoric times. Conservation palaeobiology is a developing field that aims to understand the long-term dynamics of such interactions by studying the geohistorical records in a conservation perspective. Case studies exist for vertebrates and plants, but insects have largely been overlooked so far. Here, we analysed the current red-listed beetle species (Coleoptera) in Sweden and investigated their occurrence and representation in the European Quaternary fossil record. Fossil data currently exist for one third of the Swedish red-listed beetle species. All the red-list conservation classes are represented in the fossil record, which may allow for comparative studies. We found significantly different representations in the fossil records among taxonomic groups and ecological traits, which may depend on the fossil depositional and sampling environments and variation in how difficult species are to identify. Species that are today associated with modern urban environments were mostly found in Quaternary sites with archaeological human settlements, reflecting early human-driven environmental change. Combining modern and fossil insect species data for biodiversity conservation needs to be undertaken with care, and attention paid to biases in both modern and palaeo-data. Nevertheless, this approach opens new opportunities for conservation biology by providing a millennial-scale perspective on biodiversity change, including consideration of the long-term dynamics of species range shifts, species invasions and regional extinctions under changing climates. © 2021},

	abstract = {Invasion by exotic plant species has led to concerns of homogenization of biotic communities. Where plant invasion occurs, heterogeneity in plant community composition can decrease, even when other diversity responses are minimal. Homogenization of soil communities may also result from exotic plant invasion, though responses of soil communities to plant invasion are relatively understudied. In a long-term study underway since 2007, we examined effects of invasion and subsequent management of Gypsophila paniculata, a large invasive forb on Lake Michigan sand dunes, on aboveground plant community diversity and heterogeneity and belowground nematode community diversity and heterogeneity using Bray-Curtis and Jaccard dissimilarity measures. While invasion and management had only minor effects on plant and nematode richness and Shannon diversity, we found that invasion reduced plant and nematode community heterogeneity while management of the invasive species increased heterogeneity at smaller spatial scales. However, at larger spatial scales, neither invasion nor management had any effect on plant or nematode community heterogeneity. Overall this indicates that this invasion had the effect of homogenizing local communities, while landscape-level heterogeneity was unaffected. Reduced heterogeneity, particularly belowground, could have effects on plant community dynamics, since plant-soil interactions can contribute to continued invasion. Including the study of the soil community will enhance our understanding of community responses during exotic plant invasion and management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Habitat loss due to anthropogenic activities is a critical threat to biodiversity. Understanding which factors determine species persistence in degraded environments is essential for conservation management. Here, we investigated how aerial insectivorous bats in the Neotropics, an ecologically important, but understudied group of vertebrates, are affected by deforestation and urbanization. We conducted a standardized acoustic survey in four habitat types in 14 areas across Panama (500. km. ×. 260. km), a scale hitherto unprecedented for the Neotropics, and assessed occupancy in 13 aerial insectivorous bat species, accounting for species- and habitat-specific detectability. In addition, we used wing measures to derive a proxy for flight efficiency and flight speed, as an indication of species-specific mobility. Results show that detectability does not only vary strongly among species but also, within a species, depending on the habitat: for nine species intra-specific detectability varied >10%. Model estimates for occupancy revealed that aerial insectivorous bats are highly heterogeneous in their response to deforestation and urbanization. Canopy height and canopy cover predicted occupancy best for most species. Relating occupancy to mobility we found that less mobile species with broad wings (high wing loading and low aspect ratio) decrease occupancy in deforested and urban areas, while more mobile species with narrow wings increase in these habitats. We suggest that this pattern applies also to species not analyzed in this study. Our study exemplifies how morphological information can help define conservation priorities when information on occurrence and distribution is limited. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Collisions with cars are an important mortality factor for many wild animals. Measures to mitigate road mortality are costly so should be implemented using cost-effective measures in locations where the road mortality is consistently highest and non-random in different species. It is thus important to identify what features causes these biodiversity collision blackspots. Almost all of the data and literature on collisions refer to vertebrates with little known about invertebrates. We used data on butterfly roadkills in three large landscape plots in Poland to identify sites where the collision rate seems to be routinely high. Biodiversity collision blackspots were identified from occurrence in successive years using spatial hierarchical clustering. Biodiversity collision blackspots comprised just 4% of the total road length, but included 49% of all road-killed butterflies. Habitats within 500. m of each blackspot was compared to random non-blackspot sites using generalized linear mixed models. The occurrence of blackspots was linked with high traffic volume, but only when cover of grassland in a landscape was high and verges had low plant species richness. Similarly, blackspots occurred with high probability when traffic volume was high but especially if grassland cover in the landscape and verge mowing frequency were also high. These blackspots had higher species richness and abundance of butterflies in the surrounding landscape than in random sites. Biodiversity collision blackspots analysis identified road sections of high road mortality for different butterfly species. Moreover, blackspots were also indication of species rich areas of conservation concern that were intersected by roads. Thus, conservation practitioners may direct mitigation measures, such as less frequent mowing and speed limit, in a cost-efficient manner in these spatially-limited locations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The illegal trade in tiger bones and body parts is crippling the remaining populations of tigers worldwide, but what effect does this trade have on other wildlife that get caught in the cross fire? The Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) is the only species of tapir found outside of South America, yet little is known of this subspecies despite its large size. Aside from habitat loss and an encroaching human population, effects of wildlife trade are taking their toll on this endangered species. In Sumatra Indonesia, tigers and tapirs are known to share habitat, potentially leaving tapirs vulnerable to fall victim to snare entrapment. This study looks at correlations between tiger and tapir indices as well as active tiger snares within Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia over a four-year period. Data was provided by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry and Fauna and Flora International, and this study investigated the frequency, and spatial relationships between all three variables. Across the study period, tiger snares increased significantly in numbers and spatial extent, indicating increased illegal poaching in KSNP. Areas with high frequencies of tiger evidence also showed high frequencies of tapir evidence, but while tiger frequency remained consistent, tapirs displayed a decreasing trend. Spatially, tiger evidence moved further away from snare and tapir locations over time, indicating tigers, (while being the target species) may display a greater response to poaching threats than tapirs. Tapir mortality was significantly correlated with the number of snares per kilometre surveyed, further supporting a negative impact from snares on tapirs. This study recommends long-term analysis to accurately determine the current population of Malayan tapirs in Sumatra and identify population trends. Identifying Sumatra's tapir population and recovery in response to poaching and habitat loss threats, must be determined to accurately inform conservation management actions of Sumatra's National Parks, and halt the decline of this illusive species. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

We sampled the bee fauna at 27 randomly selected sites along a 140-km (89-mile)segment of a transmission line that extends from Connecticut to New Hampshire. Each site contained two plots, one within the powerline corridor and another in a closely adjacent forest. Data were collected over a 12-week study period (late May to early August)with corridor plots yielding more than twice as many bee species and more than ten times the number of individuals than the forest plots. The aggregate richness for the 54 plots (=205 species)represents nearly half the bee fauna of New England with species estimation curves suggesting that many additional species were resident but went unsampled. Two globally rare species, Epeoloides pilosulus and Macropis ciliata, were documented from the powerline plots. The time-extended (five-year)vegetation management cycles currently used by many utility companies in New England result in a dynamic array of vegetation composition and structure that supports a multitude of bees as well as other insects, reptiles and amphibians, shrubland birds, small mammals, and other early successional taxa. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Predation by cats (Felis catus) is implicated in the decline and extinction of many Australian mammal species. We estimate the number of mammals killed by cats across Australia through meta-analysis of data on the frequency of mammals in cat diet samples from 107 studies. For feral cats in largely natural landscapes, the spatially-weighted mean frequency of mammals in diet samples was 70% (44% for native species, 34% for introduced species). Frequency was significantly higher on the mainland, and in areas of low temperature and topographic ruggedness. Geographic patterns varied markedly between native and introduced mammals, with native mammals most frequent in northern Australia. We estimate that: (i) 815 million individuals yr−1 are killed by feral cats in natural landscapes, 56% of which are native species; (ii) 149 million individuals yr−1 are killed by unowned cats in highly modified landscapes; and (iii) 180 million individuals yr−1 are killed by pet cats. For the latter two components, mainly introduced species are killed. Collectively, across the three components of the cat population, 1,144 million individuals yr−1 are killed by cats, of which, at least 40% (459 million individuals yr−1) are native species. It remains challenging to interpret this tally in terms of its impact on population viability for Australian mammals, because demographic information is not available for most species. However, our estimate of annual mammal mortality due to cat predation is substantially higher than that due to another key threatening process, land clearing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Understanding how traits affect species responses to threats like habitat loss may help prevent extinctions. This may be especially true for understudied taxa for which we have little data to identify declines before it is too late to intervene. We used a metric derived from citizen science data on snake occurrences to determine which traits were most correlated with species' sensitivity to human land use. We found that snake species that feed primarily on vertebrates, that use a high proportion of aquatic habitats, and that have small geographic ranges occurred in more natural and less human-dominated landscapes. In contrast, body size, clutch (or litter) size, the degree of exposure to human-dominated landscapes, reproductive mode, habitat specialization, and whether a species was venomous or not had less effect on their sensitivity to human land use. Our results extend previous findings that higher trophic position is correlated with extinction risk in many vertebrates by showing that snake species that feed primarily on vertebrates are more sensitive to human land use – a primary driver of extinction. It is likely that conversion of natural landscapes for human land use alters biotic communities, causing losses of important trophic groups, especially in aquatic and riparian communities. Practitioners should therefore prioritize preserving aquatic habitat and natural landscapes with intact biotic communities that can support species at higher trophic levels, as well as focus monitoring on populations of range-restricted species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Despite the establishment of a national protected area system at the beginning of the 20th century to protect some of the world's most biodiverse forests, Indonesia has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, due in part to the expansion of the global palm oil industry. The unique ecosystems of Sumatra, Indonesia provide habitat for critically endangered Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae), Sumatran elephants (Elephas maximus sumatrensis), and two species of orangutans (Pongo abelii and Pongo tapanuliensis). In this study, we use a matching method with generalized boosted models to determine the effectiveness of three nationally protected areas in preventing deforestation from 2002 to 2016. We also examine leakage – an increase in deforestation directly outside of protected areas relative to the wider landscape – to provide a clearer picture of the effects of agricultural expansion in this landscape. We found that Tesso Nilo National Park, with its lowland rain forest and conditions suitable for oil palm, offered the least protection from deforestation (avoided deforestation rate = 4.18%, p < 0.05 95% CI [1.97% - 6.45%]). Bukit Tigapuluh National Park, which may experience some de facto protection (i.e. protection due to factors independent of policy) with its mountainous terrain and difficult access, had the highest avoided deforestation rate (26.36%, p < 0.05 95% CI [24.17–28.55]), but had relatively high leakage (10.21%, p < 0.05 95% CI [7.51–12.98]). The low avoided deforestation rate in Tesso Nilo could be due to high localized human population and/or other socio-economic factors we were unable to control for in this study. The quantitative evidence of deforestation and effectiveness of protected areas in this heavily modified landscape supports the need for increased enforcement around protected areas locally, and globally in other oil palm production regions. These actions are critical in the preservation of global, tropical endemic flora and fauna. Indonesian abstract: Meskipun telah membangun sistem kawasan konservasi sejak awal abad ke 20 untuk melindungi hutan dengan keanekaragaman hayati yang sangat tinggi, Indonesia masih merupakan negara yang memiliki laju deforestasi yang tertinggi di dunia, akibat penkembangan industri sawit di dunia. Ekosistem-ekosistem endemic di Sumatera-Indonesia merupakan habitat bagi spesies-spesies yang memiliki status konservasi kritis yaitu harimau Sumatera (Panthera tigris sumatrae), gajah Sumatera (Elephas maximus sumatrensis), dan dua species orangutan (Pongo abelii dan Pongo tapanuliensis). Dalam penelitian ini, kami menggunakan metode matching dengan model generalized boosted untuk menentukan efektivitas dari tiga kawasan konservasi dalam mencegah terjadinya deforestasi dari tahun 2002–2016. Kami juga menilai leakage (kebocoran) – yang merupakan kenaikan laju deforestasi pada area yang berdekatan dengan kawasan konservasi– untuk memberikan gambaran yang utuh atas dampak industri sawit dunia. Kami menemukan bahwa Taman Nasional Tesso Nilo, dengan habitat dan kondisi hutan tropis dataran rendah, yang juga sesuai untuk tanaman sawit, merupakan kawasan konservasi yang memiliki kemampuan paling rendah dalam melindungi dari deforestasi (laju pencegahan deforestasi = 4.18%, p < 0.05 95% CI [1.97% - 6.45%]). Sedangkan Taman Nasional Bukit Tigapuluh yang merupakan kawasan pegunungan memiliki laju pencegahan deforestasi tertinggi (26.36%, p < 0.05 95% CI [24.17–28.55]), namun memilki nilai kebocoran yang relatif tinggi (10.21%, p < 0.05 95% CI [7.51–12.98]). Fakta kuantitatif dari deforestasi dan efektivitas kawasan konservasi pada landskap yang termodifikasi sangat berat ini mengkonfirmasi adanya kebutuhan yang mendesak untuk melakukan penguatan di sekitar kawasan konservasi baik di tingkat lokal maupun global pada wilayah yang ditujukan untuk produksi sawit. Aksi-aksi tersebut sangat dibutuhkan untuk mendukung perlindungan flora dan fauna endemik di dunia. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Significant changes in the intensity or distribution of human activities, like during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns, can cause rapid changes to the diversity, distribution and abundance of animals. These changes are usually viewed as positive for ecosystems. Here, we mapped the abundance and habitat associations of coastal vertebrates along approximately 50 km of ocean beaches on the Sunshine Coast in eastern Australia using baited trail cameras before (April–June 2018 and 2019) and during the April–May 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. Many Torresian crows (Corvus orru) occur in urban areas where they scavenge for human-derived food. When this food source collapsed during the COVID-19 lockdown, Torresian crows moved to beaches where we recorded a 6-fold increase in abundance. Torresian crows principally moved to beaches with greater extent of remnant vegetation and larger average tree height. Because anthropogenic food sources would be less abundant on these more natural beaches, rapid changes in the abundance of these aggressive feeders on beaches could result in Torresian crows 1) outcompeting scavengers like large raptors for naturally occurring carrion, 2) consuming insects, crustaceans and other small animals (like small mammals and reptiles) along more natural coastlines, causing potentially significant changes to animal assemblage structure along beaches, and 3) depredating eggs and hatchlings from nests of other birds. Our results highlight that the ecological effects of changes to human pressures are nuanced, depending strongly on the functional role and behaviour of species and the landscape attributes in which they interact with the broader assemblages and ecosystem. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Rocky outcrops are geological features that encompass a wide variety of physical environments, including escarpments, overhangs, cliffs, tors, boulder-heaps and insular domes (inselbergs). They support high levels of species diversity and endemism, and provide stable micro-climates for thousands of years. They provide critical breeding sites for many top order mammalian and avian predators; nesting sites for colonial species such as seabirds, bats and swifts and ecological refuges for ancient lineages. Rock overhangs and caves also provide important insights into our ecological past where they contain the remains of extinct species. Because rocky environments are generally less fertile, steep-sided and less accessible than the surrounding landscape, they are typically less prone to human disturbances. Nonetheless, many rocky outcrops, particularly in commodity production landscapes, face a variety of threats including soil compaction and erosion caused by livestock; nutrient enrichment and weed invasion; introduced predators; and physical damage caused by recreational and quarrying activities. Even rocky outcrops in seemingly pristine environments may be affected by altered fire regimes, air pollution (including acid rain) and potentially climate change. In agricultural landscapes, various approaches have been taken to conserve rocky outcrops, including land acquisition for conservation, fencing from livestock and private land conservation agreements with landholders. In more intact landscapes, targeted actions to conserve rock-dwelling fauna include limiting human access to critical breeding sites, baiting to reduce pressure from introduced predators, restoring rock microhabitat and translocation of endangered species. Future management actions will need to involve better inventory of the biophysical attributes and fine-scale mapping to improve the awareness of these small natural features. © 2016},

	abstract = {Abandoned, lost or discarded fishing nets, (ghost nets) represent a major threat to marine vertebrates. However, thorough assessments of their impact on threatened species are largely missing. In the Maldives, olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) are frequently caught in ghost nets however the archipelago does not support a significant nesting population. Our aim in this study was to determine the origin of olive ridleys entangled in ghost nets found in the Maldives and evaluate potential impacts on respective source populations. Based on a citizen science and conservation program, we recorded 132 olive ridley turtles entangled in ghost nets in just one year. Genetic analyses (mtDNA) of entangled individuals and of potential source populations revealed that most captured olive ridleys originated from Sri Lanka and eastern India. Oman could be excluded as source population, even during the prevalence of the south west monsoon. Based on our results and already available published literature, we were able to estimate that the recorded ghost net entanglements accounted for a relatively small amount (0.48%) of the eastern Indian population. However, the entangled turtles accounted for a much larger percentage (41%) of the Sri Lankan populations. However, it should be noted that our estimates of population-level mortality are linked to substantial uncertainty due to the lack of reliable information on population dynamics. Consequently, any precautionary protection measures applied should be complemented with improved quantification of turtle recruitment and life-stage specific mortalities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wild vertebrates play a decisive role in the subsistence economy of human populations worldwide. The food security value of wild-meat extracted from natural ecosystems remains poorly quantified. Here, we provide an economic valuation of the nutritional and monetary benefits of year-round wild-meat hunting across a large trinational region of southwestern Amazonia using data from indigenous and non-indigenous settlements from 30 sites. We then build scenarios to explore whether three ubiquitous sources of regional-scale household income (i.e. wage labour, horticultural revenues from manioc flour production and the harvest of Brazil-nuts) could match the purchase costs of alternative meat demand to meet domestic consumption of animal protein should game stocks collapse for any reason. We also considered a fourth valuation scenario in terms of game meat substitution with bovine beef. We conservatively estimate a total annual consumption of ~1431.8 tons of undressed animal carcasses, equivalent to a mean per-capita meat consumption of 54.75 kg person−1 yr−1, or ~10.9 kg of animal protein person−1 yr−1. This overall consumption of terrestrial wildlife meat provides US$7.875 million yr−1 across the study region. However, household income levels were too low to enable transitions into domestic livestock consumption indicating low adaptation capacity to alternative animal protein; replacement purchases of domestic meat would amount to 90% of aggregate annual wages, 194% of overall income from manioc flour, and 67% of all Brazil-nuts collected. Complete beef replacement by the population in this region would require further inputs of US$2.658 million yr−1 and the conversion of 4310 ha of Amazonian forests into pasture. Our results emphasize the extraordinarily valuable and irreplaceable role of wild meat in the food security of tropical forest dwellers. Proposing consumption of alternative sources of animal protein for monetarily deprived forest dwellers is clearly an unrealistic, if not environmentally-damaging, strategy. Conservation scientists, wildlife biologists and policy makers should therefore prioritize adding value to standing forests by managing sustainable wild-meat offtake from natural ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The offset targeted three threatened vertebrates: squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis), brown treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus) and superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii). Clearing led to the loss of 587 tree hollows and the offset was the placement of an equivalent number of nest boxes in nearby woodland (1:1 ratio). Of these, we monitored 324 nest boxes in six sample periods between 2010 and 2013, yielding 2485 individual checks of nest boxes. For the three target species, we found: (1) no records of nest box use by the superb parrot, (2) two records of the brown treecreeper (0–0.76% of accessible nest boxes used per survey period), and (3) seven records of use of nest boxes by the squirrel glider (0–2.1% of accessible nest boxes used per survey period). Rates of nest box use by the superb parrot and squirrel glider were markedly lower than rates of use of hollow-bearing trees observed in other investigations. Low levels of use by target species coupled with the extent of nest box attrition suggest the offset program will not have counterbalanced the loss of the hollow-bearing trees. We make suggestions for improving future offset programs including a greater emphasis on: (1) avoiding impacts on hollow-bearing trees; (2) offset effectiveness as a measure of compliance; and (3) using realistic offset ratios. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In 1996 we developed an Icon User Interface design for handheld computers that enabled non-literate trackers to enter complex data. When employed in large numbers over extended periods of time, trackers can gather large quantities of complex, rich biodiversity data that cannot be gathered in any other way. One significant result in the Congo was that data collected by trackers made it possible to alert health authorities to outbreaks of Ebola in wild animal populations, weeks before they posed a risk to humans. Trackers can also play a critical role in preventing the decimation of large mammal fauna due to poaching. Collectively, the seven case studies reviewed in this paper demonstrate the richness and complexity of scientific data contributed by community-based citizen science. Furthermore, trackers can also make novel contributions to science, demonstrated by scientific papers co-authored by trackers. This may have far-reaching implications for the development of an inclusive citizen science. Community-based tracking can significantly contribute to large-scale, long-term monitoring of biodiversity on a worldwide basis. However, community-based citizen science in developing countries will require international support to be sustainable. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Reflecting their species richness and ecological diversification, insects play a central role in terrestrial ecosystems but difficulties in species-level assignments have restricted large-scale analysis of their community structure. Employing South Africa's largest national park as a model system, we demonstrate that DNA barcoding can break this barrier. A year-long deployment of Malaise traps at 25 sites in Kruger National Park (KNP) generated 1000+ weekly collections containing about 800,000 specimens. Insect biomass averaged 1.05 g per trap-day but varied by up to 2-fold between months, being lower in the dry than wet season. Nearly 370,000 specimens were individually analyzed to reveal 19,730 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs; species proxy), a count equal to 43% of the known insect fauna of southern Africa. There was clear differentiation in insect richness and composition between KNP's two ecoregions, but little among the vegetation types comprising them. The spatial gradient in annual rainfall explained more than half of the variation in compositional similarity among sites with less similarity among samples in the wet season, particularly among those in high rainfall areas. These results suggest that the factors organising insect communities in KNP are not fine-scale vegetation differences, but larger-scale processes associated with ecoregions and rainfall. Estimates of sample coverage indicate that the species not collected are rare, comprising only 4% of the individuals in the community. With a well-parameterized DNA barcode reference library in place, metabarcoding can be used to assess future shifts in the insect fauna of KNP rapidly and inexpensively. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Forest restoration may support recovery and conservation of biodiversity. However, the response of biodiversity to forest restoration is likely to vary depending on the restoration strategy used and taxa considered. Our goal was to assess the recovery of amphibians, a highly threatened biological group, in three cloud forests under different restoration strategies. We compared different measures of species diversity in cattle pasture, 13-year-old forest under passive restoration (P13), 23-year-old forest under passive restoration (P23), 23-year-old forest under active restoration (A23) and mature cloud forest in Mexico. We sampled amphibians in 45 plots and measured landscape and habitat variables to assess their influence on amphibian recovery. We found a total of 13 amphibian species, of which 23% are in the Vulnerable (VU) category of the IUCN Red List and 15% are Critically Endangered (CR). All forests under restoration recovered amphibian species richness and composition, including that of the threatened species, but abundance differed among restoration strategies. Abundance of VU and CR species was higher in A23 than in P13 and P23, but that of CR species was highest in cloud forest. Responses to forest restoration differed among taxa; recovery of salamanders was lower than that of anurans. Proximity to water bodies, as well as high canopy and leaf litter cover, had a strong positive influence on amphibian recovery. Our results indicate that recovery of threatened biodiversity could be promoted through forest restoration, particularly active restoration, and highlight the essential role of mature forest in the maintenance and recovery of amphibian communities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have a near-global distribution. They range from being feral and free-ranging to owned and completely dependent on humans. All types of domestic dogs can interact with wildlife and have severe negative impacts on biodiversity. Here, we use IUCN Red List data to quantify the number of threatened species negatively impacted by dogs, assess the prevalence of different types of dog impact, and identify regional hotspots containing high numbers of impacted species. Using this information, we highlight key research and management gaps and priorities. Domestic dogs have contributed to 11 vertebrate extinctions and are a known or potential threat to at least 188 threatened species worldwide. These estimates are greater than those reported by previous assessments, but are probably conservative due to biases in the species, regions and types of impacts studied and/or reported. Predation is the most frequently reported impact, followed by disturbance, disease transmission, competition, and hybridisation. Regions with the most species impacted are: South-east Asia, Central America and the Caribbean, South America, Asia (excluding SE), Micro/Mela/Polynesia, and Australia. We propose that the impacts of domestic dogs can be better understood and managed through: taxonomic and spatial prioritisation of research and management; examining potential synergisms between dogs and other threatening processes; strategic engagement with animal welfare and human health campaigns; community engagement and education; and mitigating anthropogenic effects such as resource subsidies. Such actions are essential for threatened species persistence, especially given that human and dog populations are expected to increase both numerically and geographically in the coming decades. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biological invasions are a big concern due to their potential to impact ecosystems, as well as local people. The hippo Hippopotamus amphibius, native to Africa, has invaded extensive areas of the Magdalena River basin (Colombia) over the past decades, and has been considered the largest invasive animal in the world. Here, we propose the use of two approaches of predictive modeling, in order to guide recommendations for the management of this biological invasion. First, we developed a population viability analysis (PVA) to simulate a hypothetical population growth under different management scenarios. Next, we explored the potential invasion area under future climate change scenarios throughout ecological niche modeling analyses. PVA models predicted that in the absence of an intense culling/hunting pressure, the population size will continue to steadily increase, which is consistent with the population growth observed during the last 20 years. Furthermore, our static and dynamic habitat suitability projections suggested that without dispersal limiting factors, potential colonization habitat for hippos may become very extensive across the landscape and can be favored by climate change in the future. Therefore, our findings show the urgent need of taking critical management decisions by the Colombian authorities, which should be focused on limiting the hippos' population growth and expansion. Ignoring cost-benefit considerations for the control of this invasive species may have unexpected and long-term social and ecological implications. However, the proposal of a course of action can become controversial when the species has a charismatic value for the society, regardless of its ecological or social impact. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Government shelter-in-place (SIP) orders have been used to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19, resulting in unprecedented reductions in global traffic volumes. Using traffic and collision data from four US states (California, Idaho, Maine, and Washington), we investigated changes in total WVC, following the state and local SIP orders. From mid-March to mid-April 2020, these orders have resulted in up to 71%, 63%, 73%, and 72% reduction in driving, as measured by vehicle miles traveled (VMT), in CA, ID, ME, and WA respectively. The daily WVC rates from the 4 weeks prior to SIP orders going into effect, to the 4 weeks after, declined 34%, with 21, 36, 44, and 33% declines for CA, ID, ME, and WA, respectively. For mountain lions (Puma concolor) in CA, there was a 58% decline in mortality during the traffic reduction. The changes in WVC from 1 month pre-SIP orders to 1 month post-order only occurred in 2020 and not 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, or 2019, suggesting that the reductions were associated with the reductions in traffic. The measured declines in WVC reversed in ME and WA during May, June and July 2020, paralleling reversals in traffic volumes. A 34% reduction in WVC would potentially equate to 10s of millions fewer vertebrates killed on US roadways during one month of traffic reduction, representing an unintentional conservation action unprecedented in modern times. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The management of widely dispersed marine vertebrates can be facilitated by better understanding their distribution, density, population trends and threats. Unfortunately, for some populations of sea turtle spatial and temporal data are often lacking, particularly along the Atlantic coast of Africa, a region which is considered globally important. Here we combined spatially limited monitoring data from four nesting beaches over seven seasons with an extensive ground-based coastal survey that covered 585. km of Gabon's Atlantic coast, to provide the first population assessment for the olive ridley turtle Lepidochelys olivacea. This species is currently classified as data deficient by the IUCN in the eastern Atlantic and so is considered a regional conservation priority. Whilst the logistics required to undertake such a comprehensive ground-based census were complicated, the method proved extremely effective in providing population estimates for a widely dispersed marine vertebrate and demonstrates the importance of focusing beyond intensively monitored beaches. In particular, our findings reveal that the presence of nesting activity spans almost the entirety of Gabon's coast, the density of which subsequently reveals that Gabon hosts one of the most important olive ridley rookeries in the Atlantic (2370-9814 clutches, approximating to 948-5452 breeding females per annum and a total estimate of 1422-8178 breeding females), with a significant proportion, 81. ±. 3.5% (mean. ±. 1 S.D.) of total nesting effort occurring within protected areas.

	abstract = {Without a shift to renewable energy sources, climate change will have adverse effects on many terrestrial and aquatic species. On the other hand, replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will have different effects on wildlife, some negative. To protect biota, while navigating the complexities surrounding the transition to renewable energy, will require sharing knowledge between energy experts and wildlife experts, as well as policy makers and resource managers. This special issue is intended to advance the conversation. Interactions between renewable energy facilities and fauna are complex. Each source of renewable energy has its own conservation concerns, and each presents its own set of opportunities for mitigation; Other concerns and mitigations are shared. In this overview, we review climate risks to biota, clarify the complementarities among renewables for the conservation community, and summarize research on energy effects on biota for the energy community. The papers invited for this special issue address fossil (coal, oil, natural gas) and renewable energy (terrestrial biomass energy, hydropower, marine-hydrokinetic energy, wind energy, solar energy) and affected fauna. We hope that the results of these studies, and others like them, set us on a path toward low-carbon energy systems that provide society with energy while protecting future biodiversity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Saline lakes are threatened globally and provide critical habitat for a diverse array of migratory and breeding waterbirds. The ability of large numbers of waterbirds to profitably use saline lakes is primarily dependent upon concentrations of invertebrate fauna that are only present within a narrow range of salinities. Additionally, waterbirds themselves can incur steep physiological costs as their salt loads increase, meaning that they are especially sensitive to changes in salinity. Nonetheless, relatively little is known about ecosystem function within natural saline lakes or how birds will respond to fluctuations in salinity across time, hindering efforts to maintain ecologically functional saline ecosystems. To help address this gap, we coupled data from waterbird surveys undertaken across 25 years at Lake Abert, Oregon, USA with data on lake area (a proxy for salinity) and invertebrate abundance to document how waterbird numbers changed in response to variation in lake area and the presence of their invertebrate prey. We found that as the area of Lake Abert decreased and salinity increased, both invertebrate and waterbird numbers declined, with especially high salinities associated with the presence of few waterbirds and invertebrates. However, we also found that at high lake levels and low salinities the abundance of most waterbirds and invertebrates either plateaued or declined as well. Our study reinforces physiological studies showing that both invertebrates and waterbirds can only tolerate a narrow range of salinities, and is among the first to document the effects of this tolerance range at the ecosystem level. As anthropogenic water usage increases and snowfall decreases in the coming century, Great Basin saline lakes are projected to increasingly face water shortages and high salinities. Conserving saline lake ecosystems thus requires mitigating these losses and maintaining water levels and salinities within the normal range of inter-annual variation. When conditions outside of this range occur too frequently or persist too long, they can result in dysfunctional ecosystems with deleterious consequences for the species that rely on them. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Roads can form barriers to movement for many species, and may reduce the ability of individuals to access foraging and breeding habitat. The impacts of roads on terrestrial fauna has been well studied, however little is known of the impact of roads on insectivorous bats. Wildlife crossing structures (e.g. fauna underpasses) may reduce the barrier impacts of roads and improve connectivity across roads. Use of underpasses by wildlife likely varies among species depending on their movement behaviour. In this study, we investigated whether the flight patterns of insectivorous bats influenced their use of underpasses. We monitored bat activity under and above 6 open-span bridges, 6 box culverts and 6 unmitigated sites along a major highway in Australia. We used Poisson regression models within a Bayesian framework of inference to compare the activity of 12 bat species (grouped into three guilds based on their flight patterns: clutter-adapted, edge-adapted, and open-adapted species) under the structures, over the road above the structures, above unmitigated segments of the highway, and in the vegetation adjacent to the roads. Bats were less active above the road than they were in the surrounding vegetation or under bridges. Two of the three guilds (i.e. seven species) crossed the highway more under bridges than they did under culverts or by going over the road, which suggests that bridges may reduce barrier effects of the road better than culverts. Installing bridges instead of culverts may better reduce the impacts of roads on multiple insectivorous bats species with a single structure type. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Caucasus region is a meeting point for culture and nature, lying at the nexus of Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa, and identified as one of 36 global biodiversity hotspots. The Republic of Georgia, the center of the Caucasus biodiversity hotspot, encompasses a geographically diverse landscape inhabited by a remarkable, endemic, and understudied flora and fauna under increasing threat from human activities. A wave of new and proposed dams for hydropower presents one of the most pressing challenges for freshwater biodiversity conservation in Georgia, a country where hydropower accounts for >90% of electricity. However, this situation remains largely unknown to the international scientific community and there is limited scientific information available about Georgia in the internationally indexed peer-reviewed literature. In this article, we describe the geography, politics, and freshwater biodiversity of rivers of Georgia, with a focus on fishes. We examine trends in hydropower development over the past century and identify four distinct periods: the pre-Soviet period (until 1921), the Soviet period (1921–1991), the 1990s immediately following Georgia's declaration of independence, and the 21st century. We explore the effects of existing and proposed dams on the connectivity of rivers of western Georgia and their potential consequences for conservation of diadromous, potamodromous, and resident fish. Using the Dendritic Connectivity Index (DCI) as an analytical lens, we found serial decreases in DCI values following different periods of hydropower development in the country. Finally, we offer four considerations for future research and conservation in light of ongoing hydropower development: i) expand biodiversity research and environmental monitoring, ii) assess and implement environmental flows for Georgian rivers, iii) implement strategic planning for new hydropower development, and iv) establish strict conservation areas for protection of endangered sturgeons. © 2021},

	abstract = {Ecological thresholds are an indicator of rapid and non-linear changes along both natural habitat and land-use gradients. Thus, they can be used to quantify biodiversity responses to human-induced environmental change. We investigated multiple thresholds by analyzing eight environmental predictors of both taxonomic and functional composition of amphibian and bird communities in 47 independent sample units, located within a heterogeneous land use matrix of the megadiverse Atlantic Forest hotspot. We demonstrate that current land use practices alter both the taxonomic and functional composition and promote the establishment of non-native taxa resulting in novel assemblages. Whereas anuran communities experienced dramatic compositional shifts as a result of the transformation of closed forest habitats into Eucalyptus monocultures (at less than 10% land cover), bird communities were mainly altered through the loss of old-growth forest (at 20% forest cover loss). In both groups, observed thresholds were lower than previously reported and much lower than the 20% forest set-aside requirement defined by current land-use legislation. We argue that the strategy of halting forest loss through rapid afforestation with non-native trees has converse and potentially detrimental effects on the conservation of native forest biodiversity. Future studies need to investigate how including novel assemblages in current conservation management strategies can enhance biodiversity protection in human-impacted forest landscapes. The identification of taxon-specific thresholds for both taxonomic and functional community shifts is indispensable when formulating common land use practices and designing mitigation measures. Threshold analyses can guide these actions by providing clear and quantifiable break-points for conservation practitioners. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The destruction of natural habitats is causing loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Although a “zero deforestation” is targeted, agriculture expansion caused by increasing human population and per capita consumption might boost the destruction of natural habitats in the coming decades. Here, we estimated the current and future extinction crisis in terrestrial ecoregions caused by habitat destruction and related this pattern with the current conservation efforts. We applied an Endemics-Area Relationship to assess vertebrates' potential extinctions in 513 ecoregions based on current land cover data and a future scenario of habitat loss. We compared our predictions to the proportion of the ecoregions' area formally protected, testing the concordance between threat distribution and conservation efforts. Finally, we evaluated how the distribution of threat relates to the biodiversity hotspots delimitation. We found that 2134 endemic vertebrates are currently threatened due to accumulated habitat loss, which is consistent with the assessment of the IUCN Red List. Further, this threat could overtake 4209 species when considering habitat loss projections to 2040. Our findings indicate a high concentration of threat in a few megadiverse localities, some of them outside the biodiversity hotspots. We found little overlap between our predictions of extinction and current protected areas distribution. This study supports current biodiversity crisis diagnoses and the expected recrudescence of Anthropocene defaunation in the future when considering scenarios of further habitat destruction. Our analysis also contributes to the definition of global priorities to prevent further biodiversity loss. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Increased atmospheric deposition rates of nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) are known to affect soil biogeochemistry and cause a decline in plant biodiversity of heathlands. Concomitant declines of heathland invertebrates are mainly attributed to changes in vegetation composition and altered habitat structure. While there may also be effects on animals through altered plant chemistry, these have received little attention up to now. Here, we remedy this by quantifying soil nutrient and acid buffering status, vegetation composition and structure, plant nutrient stoichiometry, and densities and species richness of Diptera and Carabidae in two large heathland systems. Soil acid buffering status appeared to be a key driver for plant P availability. Sod-cutting was found to further increase plant N:P ratios, suggesting increased P-limitation. Vegetation N:P ratio was negatively linked to invertebrate density and species richness, and was found to impact fauna more strongly than vegetation structure and plant species richness. The relationship between invertebrates and plant C:N ratio was weaker and less consistent, suggesting that for invertebrates, plant P is generally more limiting than N. Our results imply that the role of plant stoichiometry is underestimated in explaining declines of heathland invertebrates, and we here provide a novel mechanistic model including this pathway. Management should therefore not only focus on restoring habitat structural complexity, attention should be paid to restoring plant stoichiometry. This can be achieved through restoring biogeochemical soil conditions, especially by mitigating soil acidification, while measures solely focusing on removal of accumulated N by means of sod-cutting should be avoided. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wildlife hunting for commercial products has been responsible for decline of many large vertebrates around the globe. An Amazonian example of this worldwide trend is the use of caiman and dolphins as bait for the piracatinga catfish fishery. While it is a controversial issue in Amazonia conservation, there is no data on key biological aspects, such as age and sex, of those animals illegally hunted for bait. This lack of data complicates understanding of the true impact of bait-hunting on the targeted species. In this study, we present results of one year of participatory monitoring of bait-hunting in 12 communities in the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR), Brazilian Amazonia, during which participants recorded aspects of hunting activity and biometric data of animals used as piracatinga bait. The piracatinga fishery at MSDR has distinct spatial and seasonal patterns, being concentrated close to distribution centers and intensifying during the dry season. Adult male black caiman is the main bait used by fishermen, but viscera of commercial fish provide a potential alternative bait source for the piracatinga fishery. All recorded bait hunting was for caiman, none for dolphins. Despite the predominant use of caiman as bait, MSDR caiman populations remain the largest within the species' distribution. We suggest that informal management of caiman conducted by MSDR residents has guaranteed regional sustainability of the piracatinga fishery. In a broader context, the current study highlights the potential for participatory research with local populations in formulating well-informed decisions for the conservation of natural resources and economic alternatives focused on the conservation of human-natural systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Amphibians are undergoing a global conservation crisis, and they are one of the most underrepresented groups of vertebrates in the global network of protected areas (PAs). In this study, we evaluated the ability of the world's PAs to represent extant amphibian species. We also estimated the magnitude of the human footprint along the geographic distributions of gap species (i.e., those with distributions totally outside PAs). Twenty-four percent of species (n=1535) are totally unrepresented, and another 18% (n=1119) have less than 5% of their distribution inside PAs. Nearly half of all species with ranges under 1000km2 do not occur inside any PA. Furthermore, more than 65% of the distribution of gap species is in human-dominated landscapes. Although the Earth's PAs have greatly increased during the last ten years, the number of unprotected amphibians has also grown. Tropical countries in particular should strongly consider (1) the importance of using amphibians to drive conservation policies that eventually lead to the implementation and management of PAs, given amphibians' extinction risk and ability to act as bioindicators; (2) the effectiveness of national recovery plans for threatened amphibian species; and (3) the need for increased funding for scientific research to expand our knowledge of amphibian species. Meanwhile, data-deficient amphibian species should receive a higher priority than they usually receive in conservation planning, as a precautionary measure. Throughout this paper, we point out several challenges in creating more comprehensive amphibian conservation strategies and opportunities in the next decade. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Albertine Rift region of Africa is one of the most biodiverse areas on the planet, with more threatened and endemic vertebrates than elsewhere on the continent. Many of the endemic species are confined to montane forest or alpine areas. We assessed impacts of loss of habitat to agriculture and predicted impacts from niche modelling of climate change to the endemic species of the Albertine Rift. Modelling species distributions for 162 endemic terrestrial vertebrates and plants, we estimated the average percentage of habitat already lost to agriculture at 38% across all species. However, of the remaining suitable habitat the average percentage protected is currently 46%, greatly increased by the recent establishment of Itombwe, Kabobo and Ngandja Reserves in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo from 30%. Species ranges in 2080 were estimated using climate models and predicted to lead to an average loss of an additional 75% of remaining suitable habitat across all species. An estimated 34 endemic species were predicted to lose >90% of their current remaining suitable habitat. The percentage of the total suitable habitat protected in parks or reserves increases under future climate change to 56% because as ranges contract more of the remaining area occurs within existing protected areas. This indicates that the protected area coverage is reasonably well located for future climate change. Based on these data we estimate that 46% of the endemic species we assessed would qualify for threatened status on the global Red List. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Conservation translocations (including reintroductions) are potentially powerful tools for wildlife conservation, and their use has increased worldwide. However, most studies have focused on vertebrates, with the long-term impact and ecological progress of translocations being neglected. Moreover, such projects rarely target insects. The present study reports the long-term persistence of a population of Leucorrhinia dubia (Odonata: Libellulidae) reintroduced to artificially created bog pools in the Czech Republic. Eighty (pen)ultimate instar L. dubia larvae were translocated in 2001, and the dragonfly assemblage at the reintroduction site was monitored for 15 years following larvae release. In 2015–2017, the capture-mark-recapture method, the Jolly-Seber model, and exuviae collection were used to evaluate the demography of the translocated population. Microsatellite analysis was performed to assess the genetic variability of source and reintroduced populations. Over the monitored period, population size increased (80 larvae released vs. 108–115 exuviae and 75 adults at the end of the study) and L. dubia became a dominant species, whereas the composition and abundance of the local dragonfly assemblage were not substantially changed. These results indicate that reintroductions are effective measures for dragonfly conservation, as translocating a relatively small number of individuals led to the establishment of a self-sustaining population. Using (pen)ultimate instar larvae was optimal for dragonfly translocation, but the availability of a high-quality habitat and the active collaboration with nature conservation authorities were vital for the successful outcome. Genetic analysis suggested that the translocated population might serve as a source of genetic variation for the original population, if depleted. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

This suggests that narrowly distributed species are more vulnerable to human impacts, which may have implications for the predictive use of comparative extinction-risk models in conservation planning. However, this association is potentially circular because many species that have suffered substantial declines now have small geographic ranges, making it difficult to separate the role of range size as a predictor of extinction risk from its role as a response to human impact. Here we use data for Australian mammals to compare models of extinction risk that include current geographic range size with models that include historic range sizes reconstructed for the period before European settlement. We find that current range size is a strong predictor of a species' IUCN Red List classification. However, when historic range sizes are used, range size is non-significant and life-history traits assume primary importance in the model. Models that include current range size also tend to underestimate levels of latent extinction risk (the discrepancy between a species' current extinction risk and that predicted from its biological traits), giving misleading predictions of the species and regions with greatest potential for future species declines. The results suggest that there is circularity in the use of current range size to predict rates of species decline, and that species with inherently small distributions are not necessarily the most vulnerable to human impact. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Populations of organisms that create habitat can often be fragmented throughout landscapes by anthropogenic disturbances such as harvesting and loss or change to the identity of such bioengineers may lead to large changes in biodiversity. Using the fauna associated with a bioengineer, the intertidal mussel Perna perna, we tested hypotheses about the relative importance of larval export from protected populations in marine reserves. Harvesting led to the replacement of P. perna and the domination of shores outside reserves by turf-forming coralline algae, mostly Corallina spp. We determined whether the diverse fauna recruiting onto artificial units of habitat placed within mussel beds differed between reserves and non-reserve areas or whether shores outside reserves, and open to harvesting, received recruits through larval export from reserves. Furthermore, we determined whether this was affected by the distance away from reserves and whether colonisation was achieved by movement of adults from surrounding biogenic habitats or via the plankton. Overall, we found no effect of increasing distance away from a reserve on the cover of adult mussels or associated fauna. We found strong effects of the presence of marine reserves on abundances of molluscs and polychaetes but not crustaceans. There were greater densities of molluscs in sites with a reserve (i.e. inside reserves, and up to 5. km outside reserve boundaries), but more polychaetes in exploited sites. For molluscs, this pattern was driven by gastropods rather than bivalves. Furthermore, although reserves had greater cover of adult mussels than non-reserve areas, recruitment of mussels was not greater inside or near to reserves. Our study illustrates the effectiveness of these reserves in protecting stocks of adult mussels, and although there was no evidence that reserves provided export of the larvae of mussels (the target species), they did provide larval export of non-targeted associated species. By protecting a harvested bioengineer and through export of the larvae of its associated fauna, these reserves fulfil some, but not all the conservation aims of a marine protected area. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {For many threatened vertebrates, captivity may be the only option for species survival. Maintaining species in captivity prior to reintroduction presents many challenges, including the need to preserve genetic diversity and mitigation of disease risks. Recent studies suggest that captivity can alter the suite of symbiotic microbes that play important roles in host health. The Panamanian golden frog ( Atelopus zeteki) has not been seen in its native habitat in Panamá since 2009. Along with habitat loss and illegal collecting, the lethal disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is responsible for the severe decline of this species. Prior to the spread of Bd into golden frog habitat, conservation organizations collected golden frogs and placed them in captive survival assurance colonies. The skin of amphibians is host to a diverse resident bacterial community, which acts as a defense mechanism in some amphibians to inhibit pathogens. We characterized the cutaneous bacterial community from wild and F1 captive golden frogs originating from the same population with Illumina sequencing to assess how long-term captivity has affected this community. We found that species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and community structure of the skin microbiota was significantly different between wild and captive golden frogs. However, after approximately eight years of living in captivity, the offspring of the original captive golden frogs still shared 70% of their microbial community with wild frogs. These results demonstrate that host-associated microbial communities can be significantly altered by captive management, but most of the community composition can be preserved. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Reserves are frequently constrained in design and size by various financial, social or political factors. Maintenance of existing reserves must therefore rely on strategic management practices, and prioritization of conservation activities within them. Identification of global and regional hotspots have been effective for prioritizing conservation activities. Yet, identification of micro-hotspots, or overlapping areas of endemic and rare species that are under threat at the landscape scale, have largely been ignored. From a reserve management point of view, knowledge of critical micro-hotspots within a reserve, are focal points for directing cost effective, conservation initiatives, especially removal of invasive alien plants which are a major threat to biodiversity.Using diversity patterns of dragonfly assemblages, many endemic and threatened, within a biosphere reserve located in the core of a global biodiversity hotspot, we investigated the concept of micro-hotspots. As biosphere reserves contain zones with varying degrees of anthropogenic impact, we also investigated the value of buffer and transition zones for complementing the dragonfly fauna of the reserve core. We found a distinct micro-hotspot within the protected core zone which shows concordance for both endemism and species richness. We conclude that focused conservation actions to remove invasive alien plants within this micro-hotspot would help insure its continued integrity. Furthermore, while there is greater habitat degradation within the buffer and transition zones, they support many additional species, but not those necessarily endemic or threatened. The complementary value of buffer and transition zones therefore lies in increasing habitat heterogeneity and species richness of the whole reserve. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Concerns have been expressed about the use of these distribution metrics for migratory aquatic species as they often have naturally restricted distributions that change at different life stages. The conservation status of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) of the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada is currently being assessed and distribution metrics have been estimated. We compared metrics for Sockeye salmon to similar values for 57 assessments of vertebrate, invertebrate and plant species conducted by COSEWIC. Relationships among the metrics were generally similar between Fraser River Sockeye salmon and COSEWIC assessments, suggesting that despite concerns about the applicability of occurrence and abundance metrics and corresponding methodologies to highly migratory and aquatic taxa, Fraser River Sockeye salmon do not demonstrate large departures compared to other species assessed in Canada. The majority of Fraser River Sockeye salmon distribution metrics fell below thresholds for endangered or threatened statuses. However, we also observed that reported values for species assessed by COSEWIC had little relationship to the status that was ultimately assigned. Thus, based on results of this study, the ultimate role of the distribution metrics in COSEWIC status assessment is uncertain. © 2014.},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of fauna reintroduction programs has been limited by the availability of source animals and the lack of follow up monitoring to assess whether viable populations have been successfully established, particularly in terms of conserving genetic diversity. Here we present genetic assessment of the translocation of golden bandicoots (Isoodon auratus) from a large source population on Barrow Island off the north-west coast of Western Australia to two other island sites and a mainland fenced enclosure. We assessed the genetic diversity of animals translocated to each site and their wild-born progeny, and whether wild-born animals showed evidence of genetic bottlenecks or genetic drift from the source population. Encouragingly, we found no significant loss of genetic diversity in any of the wild-born populations compared to the source population and no significant increase in inbreeding or relatedness amongst wild-born individuals compared to founder populations two years post-translocation. However, we detected an approximately 10-fold reduction in effective population size between founding and wild-born populations. We found no apparent differentiation between wild-born populations and the original source population, or between wild-born animals and their respective founders. Population viability modeling predicts that each of the translocated populations is susceptible to loss of genetic diversity over time. Taken together these results suggest that the golden bandicoot reintroduction program has been initially successful as a result of large founding sizes and high reproductive rates; however, ongoing augmentation will be required to prevent genetic erosion and maintain evolutionary potential in the long-term. © 2014.},

	abstract = {There is a paucity of research on the wider landscape-level effects of ski-piste construction on alpine fauna. In this study, the response of alpine bird communities to the landscape changes induced by the construction of ski-pistes was investigated in the western Italian Alps. The aims were: (i) to test the hypothesis that ski-pistes have a detrimental effect on alpine grassland bird communities at a landscape-scale; and, (ii) to model local probability distributions of bird species according to different scenarios of ski-piste restoration and ski-piste proliferation above the treeline. Species richness and presence/absence data from point counts were analyzed in relation to GIS-derived landscape variables based on a 16. ha hexagon grid. Predictive variables were selected through the LASSO model selection procedure, and logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of occurrence of each species in each hexagon. Grassland species richness, and probability of occurrence of water pipit, wheatear and black redstart, significantly decreased with increasing extent of ski-piste edge. Length of ski-piste edge was in the set of best models considering a large range of habitat and landscape predictors, and are therefore clearly features that exert a strong negative effect on high alpine grassland bird communities. Predictions of species occurrence were made by applying the models to different scenarios of habitat change. These showed predicted detrimental impacts of a relatively small 10% increase in ski-piste extent, but also that grassland restoration on existing ski-pistes could result in significantly increased occurrence rates of alpine grassland species. This study suggests that ski-pistes are perceived by birds as detrimental features of the alpine landscape. To minimize their impact, new, environmentally-friendly ways of constructing pistes should be developed, which could include habitat restoration and management to obtain a level of grass cover such that edges of ski-pistes are no longer perceived by birds. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, invasive alien species increasingly contribute to environmental change and are a massive drain on social and economic resources. In Australia, the detection of new vertebrate incursions (i.e., alien species not currently established) has increased over the last decade. In other parts of the world, zoos have been identified as one of the influential pathways for the establishment of alien vertebrate species. We quantified the number of vertebrate species released (escaped and stolen) from Australian zoos between 1870 and 2010. The majority of reported releases (185 out of 230) have occurred since 1985. Most of the species (77.9%), which have escaped, or been stolen, from Australian zoos have only ever been released once. In sum, escapes were much more common (89%) than thefts. Compared to the other three vertebrate classes (amphibians, birds, mammals) reptiles experienced a significantly greater proportion of thefts than expected by chance. Almost half of all escapes (46%) were bird species. Birds also had the lowest retrieval rate, and therefore posed the greatest potential risk to establishment and subsequent invasion. We used phylogenetic logistic regression models to assess the association of evolutionary traits correlated with the propensity of a bird species for escaping. There was only weak evidence of phylogenetic signal (association among related species) in the tendency of a bird to escape. Bird species were significantly more likely to have escaped if their current total collection size was larger. There was no relationship between escape and the type of holding (aviary versus free-range/open-pond), or life history traits (adult body size and geographic breeding range size). Zoos are a prominent part of our culture and play a valuable role in education and conservation. Captive animals, including those in zoos, are subject to release, through both intentional and unintentional pathways, however, the establishment of alien species associated with Australian zoos is extremely low. We conclude that, in Australia, the risk of introduction by alien species from zoos is low, and substantially less than other 'backyard' and illegal sources of private species keeping and trade. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we discuss the potential implications of the loss of large frugivores for seed-dispersal networks. First, we review the role of large vertebrates as seed dispersers in different tropical ecosystems to show that these species are likely to be important components of seed-dispersal networks. Second, we showed that, despite their importance, large vertebrates are absent from most of the seed-dispersal networks described in the available literature. We identified three main reasons for this absence: (1) large vertebrates have already died out in the studied areas; (2) studies focus on particular taxonomic groups that consist mostly of small birds; and (3) it is inherently difficult to describe the interactions of naturally rare and secretive species such as large vertebrates. We argue that a proper evaluation of the importance of large frugivores within seed-dispersal networks would benefit from considering aspects other than the frequency of interactions. We suggest weighting pairwise interactions by their ecological consequences to quantify the contribution of large frugivores to outcomes of seed dispersal, such as landscape connectivity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Unregulated hunting of large-bodied frugivores is ubiquitous in tropical forests. Due to their low fecundity and complex social organization, large primates are often the first tropical forest vertebrates to be extirpated by hunting. Large primates are important seed dispersers and the only dispersal vectors of many large-seeded plants, leading to concerns that primate-dispersed trees will succumb to large-scale recruitment failure wherever they co-occur with overhunting. We used a field experiment in a remote, nonhunted region of the western Brazilian Amazon to test how the seedling recruitment success of a primate-dispersed Sapotaceae tree (Manilkara bidentata) is affected by distance from parent trees, protection from vertebrate seed predators, and gastro-intestinal seed cleaning associated with passage through frugivorous vertebrates. Only seed cleaning significantly increased the rate of seedling recruitment. Janzen-Connell effects have been widely purported as the central mechanism for recruitment failure, but our results suggest that for many tropical forest plant species Janzen-Connell effects are a second-order effect that acts once seeds have been successfully cleaned of fruit pulp by gut treatment. As an illustration of the relative importance of the sheer quantity of seeds ingested by woolly monkeys (Lagothrix cana), we further estimate the density and dispersal services provided by a complete primate assemblage to show that L. cana cleans and disperses nearly one million seeds per km2 per 24-day Manilkara fruiting season, amounting to over 71% of the seed dispersal services provided by the entire primate assemblage. The disperser vacuum in the absence of L. cana greatly reduces the quantity of cleaned seeds deposited on the forest floor. For similar fleshy-fruited species where gut passage greatly increases survival, a simple lack of redundancy in seed consumption may be the primary driver of recruitment failure resulting from large-primate extirpation due to overhunting, with Janzen-Connell effects secondarily influencing recruitment success as a function of either dispersal distance or seed density. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Creating and managing protected areas is critical to ensure the persistence of species but dynamic threats like land-use change and climate change may reduce the effectiveness of protected areas planned under a static approach. Here we defined spatial priorities for the conservation of non-flying mammals inhabiting the Cerrado Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil, that overcome the likely impacts of land-use and climate change to this imperiled fauna. We used cutting-edge methods of species distribution models combining thousands of model projections to generate a comprehensive ensemble of forecasts that shows the likely impacts of climate change in mammal distribution. We also generate a future land-use model that indicates how the region would be impacted by habitat loss in the future. We then used our models to propose priority sites for mammal conservation minimizing species climate-forced dispersal distance as well as the mean uncertainty associated to species distribution models and climate models. At the same time, our proposal maximizes complementary species representation across the existing network of protected areas. Including land-use changes and model uncertainties in the planning process changed significantly the spatial distribution of priority sites in the region. While the inclusion of land-use models altered the spatial location of priority sites at the regional scale, the effects of climate change tended to operate at the local scale. Our solutions already include possible dispersal corridors linking current and future priority sites for mammal conservation, as well as a formal risk analysis based on planning uncertainties. We hope to provide decision makers with conservation portfolios that could be negotiated at the decision level. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Local studies of distributions along elevational gradients reveal small-scale patterns but do not allow generalizations among geographic regions or taxa.

Of these, 150 had sufficient data quality, sampling intensity, elevational range, and freedom from serious habitat disturbance to permit robust across-study comparisons. We found four main patterns: (1) species classified as elevational specialists (upper- or lower-zone specialists) are relatively more frequent in the American than Asia-Pacific tropics, with African tropics being intermediate; (2) elevational specialists are rare on islands, especially oceanic and smaller continental islands, largely due to a paucity of upper-zone specialists; (3) a relatively high proportion of plants and ectothermic vertebrates (amphibians and reptiles) are upper-zone specialists; and (4) relatively few endothermic vertebrates (birds and mammals) are upper-zone specialists. Understanding these broad-scale trends will help identify taxa and geographic regions vulnerable to global warming and highlight future research priorities. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Local ecological knowledge is an increasingly used, cost-effective source of data for conservation research and management. However, untrained observers are more likely to provide meaningful information on species that are charismatic and easily identifiable (e.g. large-bodied vertebrates) or of socio-economic importance, and may ignore or misidentify smaller-bodied, elusive and non-charismatic species. These problems may be further exacerbated by variation in environmental awareness and perception between different socio-cultural and ethnic groups often present across the range of threatened non-charismatic species. A community-based interview survey was carried out in southern Hispaniola on both sides of the Dominican Republic-Haitian border, to investigate the usefulness of local ecological knowledge for assessing status and threats to the Hispaniolan solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus) and Hispaniolan hutia (Plagiodontia aedium). These two small-bodied nocturnal endemic mammals are rarely targeted for bushmeat or encountered by rural community members, and may be confused with each other and with non-native small mammals. We demonstrate that, despite their elusive nature, both solenodons and hutias can be accurately identified by substantial numbers of respondents in rural communities. New quantitative data on levels of anthropogenic mortality also indicate that predation by free-roaming village dogs is responsible for numerous solenodon and hutia deaths. However, patterns of awareness and experience may be influenced by variation both in species status, ecology and distribution and in socio-cultural factors, and Dominican and Haitian respondents from the same landscapes have very different levels of awareness and experience of Hispaniolan native mammals, demonstrating an important distinction between local ecological knowledge and traditional ecological knowledge. © 2013.},

	abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) now form an important part of marine conservation and fisheries management; hence, there is broad interest in developing procedures that optimize their design. We used data collected over a 10-year period (2003-2012) from direct surveys and. >100. adult male and female loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) tracked with devices, including GPS loggers and Fastloc GPS-Argos, to consider the optimum design for a MPA at a globally important breeding area, where there is already an existing national marine park aiming to protect the population (Zakynthos, Greece). Turtles primarily used areas very close to shore (approx. 7. km in length by 1. km in width, within the. <10. m isobath) for breeding and foraging activity at different times of the year. We calculated that this small nearshore coastal zone encompassed 72% of all turtle GPS locations recorded in the MPA, and is therefore important for conservation management. We developed an index to evaluate the suitability of the existing and proposed conservation zones based on (1) home range area use by turtles in these zones versus (2) zone size, so that the benefit to turtles could be maximized while minimizing the negative impacts to other stakeholders (e.g., boat operators). With this evidence-based approach, we propose a modification to the existing MPA that might both enhance local economic tourism activities and better safeguard this key sea turtle breeding population. The approaches used here will have general application for the design of MPAs used by mobile species that can be tracked. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Defaunation, the loss or population decline of medium and large native vertebrates represents a significant threat to the biodiversity of tropical ecosystems. Here we review the anthropogenic drivers of defaunation, provide a brief historical account of the development of this field, and analyze the types of biological consequences of this impact on the structure and functioning of tropical ecosystems. We identify how defaunation, operating at a variety of scales, from the plot to the global level, affects biological systems along a gradient of processes ranging from plant physiology (vegetative and reproductive performance) and animal behavior (movement, foraging and dietary patterns) in the immediate term; to plant population and community dynamics and structure leading to disruptions of ecosystem functioning (and thus degrading environmental services) in the short to medium term; to evolutionary changes (phenotypic changes and population genetic structure) in the long-term. We present such a synthesis as a preamble to a series of papers that provide a compilation of our current understanding of the impact and consequences of tropical defaunation. We close by identifying some of the most urgent needs and perspectives that warrant further study to improve our understanding of this field, as we confront the challenges of living in a defaunated world. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we investigate whether an invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii, impacts native amphibians and evaluate evidence for the role of invasive plant-induced alteration of forest understory microclimate as a mechanism driving amphibian responses to L. maackii invasion. We sampled amphibian communities in forest plots with high or low density of L. maackii, and monitored microclimate (temperature and humidity at ground level) in the same forest plots. Amphibian species richness and evenness were lower in invaded plots. Invasion also resulted in shifts in amphibian species composition. Mean daily maximum temperature and mean daily temperature were lower in invaded plots, and counts of the Green frog Lithobates clamitans were marginally negatively related to mean daily temperature. Our work illustrates how an invasive ecosystem engineer may affect native organisms with which it shares no trophic connection, and suggests that changes in microclimate may be one mechanism by which alien plants affect communities where they invade. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In some tropical regions, following the abandonment of agriculture and pastures, secondary forests can recover plant species richness and forest structure (e.g. canopy cover, biomass); however, the importance of these secondary forests for fauna is not clear. Secondary forests can benefit fauna by providing suitable habitats, connecting forests fragments, and increasing gene flow. Previous studies of forest regeneration have showed different levels of amphibian recovery. In Puerto Rico, 1-5. years old secondary forests achieved similar amphibian species richness and composition in comparison with old-growth forests, while in Brazil secondary forests from 14 to 19. years of recovery only recovered 60% of the species of old-growth forests. We evaluated amphibian recovery in secondary forests in northeastern Costa Rica, by assessing amphibian recovery in 12 secondary forests that vary in age of recovery and in three old-growth forests using visual and acoustic surveys. Our sites varied in terms of their landscape (e.g. amount of surrounding forest) and forest characteristics (e.g. forest age, aboveground biomass, basal area, number of tree species, number of stems, leaf-litter depth), but there was no relationship between these characteristics and amphibian species richness or species composition. We found that amphibians are recovering rapidly in secondary forests in Costa Rica, and even young forests (10-16. years) had similar species richness and composition in comparison with old-growth forests. These forests are providing suitable microhabitats conditions for amphibians. In addition, this study highlights the importance of landscape characteristics. The abundance of amphibian species sources (e.g. forest patches) and connections between forests appear to be helping the species colonize these sites. Worldwide, the area of secondary forests is increasing, and our results show that these habitats are suitable for a diversity of amphibian species, suggesting that these forests can help reduce amphibian population and species decline. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {An invasive species is less likely to flourish if it is vulnerable to the predators it encounters in its newly-colonised range. The success of cane toads (Rhinella marina) in invading Australia has been attributed to the toads' powerful chemical defences, which render this toxic invader invulnerable to most vertebrate predators. However, invertebrate predators have been largely ignored. Our laboratory studies show that at least three invertebrate species (one coleopteran, two hemipterans) are unaffected by the toads' bufadienolide defences, and consume aquatic stages of the cane toad life history. The water beetle Cybister godeffroyi consumed eggs, hatchlings and tadpoles of R. marina, whereas the water bugs Diplonychus rusticus and Lethocerus insulanus consumed toad tadpoles but not eggs. In choice tests, C. godeffroyi and D. rusticus preferred cane toad tadpoles to simultaneously available native tadpoles or fish, possibly reflecting the smaller size and/or slower swimming speeds of larval cane toads. Rates of predation on cane toad tadpoles were high (e.g., a single water beetle often consumed five tadpoles per day in a complex environment). These abundant, voracious invertebrate predators could reduce cane toad recruitment success in some tropical waterbodies. Future research could usefully examine whether densities of water beetles and water bugs increase after toad invasion (potentially explaining why toad numbers often decline post-colonisation). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {To provide insight into raptor declines in western Africa, we investigated associations between land-use and raptor distribution patterns in Cameroon. We examined the role of breeding distribution, species' migratory mobility, diet, body size, and thus area requirements, on 5-km scale patterns of raptor richness and abundance. We recorded 15,661 individuals, comprising 55 species during road surveys, spanning four annual cycles. Results revealed evidence for the importance of National Parks (N.P.'s), natural vegetation, humans, and cotton in shaping raptor assemblages, but responses differed between functional groups and biogeographical zones. Human populations and natural habitat, interacting with zone, were important predictors of Afrotropical raptor richness, and N.P.'s of Palearctic raptor richness. Areas cleared of natural habitat in the Guinea zone had comparatively rich and abundant large, small sedentary and migratory Afrotropical raptor assemblages, but humans limited positive effects. Palearctic raptor abundance peaked at higher levels of human land-use than Afrotropical raptors. Vertebrate-hunting Palearctic raptor richness was positively associated with cropland, while cotton and human land-use in the Inundation zone had a stronger negative impact on insectivorous Palearctic raptors. Richness of large sedentary raptors declined with increasing distance to N.P.'s, contrary to communal scavenger richness, which increased with human populations. Humans, habitat loss and cotton in the Inundation and Sudan zones had similar, negative effects on small sedentary and small migratory Afrotropical raptor assemblages. We conclude that increasing human populations, natural vegetation loss, and expanding cotton will negatively affect the majority of Afrotropical and insectivorous Palearctic raptors, while vertebrate-hunting Palearctic raptors may benefit from cropland expansion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity offsets are interventions that compensate for ecological losses caused by economic development, seeking 'no net loss' (NNL) of biodiversity overall. Calculating the ecological gains required to achieve NNL is non-trivial, with various methodologies available. To date, there has been no comparison among methodologies for a common case study. We use data on industrial impacts in Uzbekistan to provide such a comparison.We quantify losses from 40. years of gas extraction, using empirical data on vegetation impacts alongside estimates of disruption to mammals. In doing so, we implement a novel technique by estimating spatial 'functional forms' of disturbance to calculate biodiversity impacts. We then use a range of offset methodologies to calculate the gains required to achieve NNL. This allows a crude comparison of the potential biodiversity outcomes of "in kind" offsets (here, vegetation restoration) with "out of kind" offsets (protecting fauna from poaching).We demonstrate that different methods for calculating the required offset activities result in divergent outcomes for biodiversity (expressed in habitat condition x area, or 'weighted area'), and different trajectories in biodiversity outcomes over time. An Australian method is currently being considered for adoption in Uzbekistan, but we show that it would require careful adjustments to achieve NNL there.These findings highlight that the method used to quantify losses and gains strongly influences the biodiversity outcomes of offsetting, implying that offsets generated using different methodologies are not transferable between jurisdictions. Further, conservation gains from out of kind offsets may outweigh those from strict in kind NNL interpretations. © 2014 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Accurately estimating abundance of wildlife is critical for establishing effective conservation and management strategies. Aerial methodologies for estimating abundance are common in developed countries, but they are often impractical for remote areas of developing countries where many of the world's endangered and threatened fauna exist. The alternative terrestrial methodologies can be constrained by limitations on access, technology, and human resources, and have rarely been comprehensively conducted for large terrestrial mammals at landscape scales. We attempted to overcome these problems by incorporating local peoples into a simultaneous point count of Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus) and goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) across the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area, Mongolia. Paired observers collected abundance and covariate metrics at 50 observation points and we estimated population sizes using distance sampling theory, but also assessed individual observer error to examine potential bias introduced by the large number of minimally trained observers. We estimated 5671 (95% CI=3611-8907) wild asses and 5909 (95% CI=3762-9279) gazelle inhabited the 11,027km2 study area at the time of our survey and found that the methodology developed was robust at absorbing the logistical challenges and wide range of observer abilities. This initiative serves as a functional model for estimating terrestrial wildlife abundance while integrating local people into scientific and conservation projects. This, in turn, creates vested interest in conservation by the people who are most influential in, and most affected by, the outcomes. © 2012.},

Species rarity and endemism are among the most fundamental criteria for establishing these priorities. We studied the patterns of rarity and the role of rare species in community uniqueness using data on freshwater bivalve molluscs (family Unionidae) in Texas. Due to the large size and gradients in landscape and climate, Texas has diverse and distinct unionid communities, including numerous regional and state endemic species. Analysis of the state-wide distribution and abundance of Unionidae allowed us to develop a non-arbitrary method to classify species rarity based on their range size and relative density. Of the 46 Unionidae species currently present in Texas, 65% were classified as rare and very rare, including all state and regional endemics. We found that endemic species were a critical component in defining the uniqueness of unionid communities. Almost all endemics were found exclusively in streams and rivers, where diversity was almost double that of lentic waters. Man's ongoing alteration of lotic with lentic waterbodies favors common species, and dramatically reduces habitat for endemics, contributing to homogenization of unionid fauna. We identified hotspots of endemism, prioritized species in need of protection, estimated their population size, and recommended changes to their current conservation status. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Agricultural expansion generates problems to ecosystems and hinders conservation efforts. Although several researchers worldwide are working to develop efficient approaches for conserving biodiversity adequately, certain decisions should be taken urgently. Here, by using two entire classes of vertebrates (amphibians and reptiles), we calculated optimal conservation area networks (CANs) under nine different scenarios (including three different degrees of land-use and three different degrees of ambition in conservation objectives), in a highly deforested province of central Argentina. We show that if conservation decisions are delayed further, not only will more land be necessary to meet a given conservation objective, but also that optimal CANs will have to have a much greater perimeter, a larger number of fragments and a less appropriate shape. Therefore, as agricultural frontiers continue to advance without designating specific sites for conservation, we are losing the possibility to conserve biodiversity adequately. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Wildlife provisioning, i.e. the provision of bait to generate aggregations of charismatic megafauna as tourist attractions, occurs around the world. This practice is often promoted as an economic incentive to conserve the focal species, yet has stimulated debate based on the potential for risks to human safety and perceptions of behavioural shifts in provisioned populations. We studied a population of Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) in the Bahamas that has been subject to regular provisioning for >20years. We used a combination of focal observations of sharks during feeding events, remote acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analysis of shark muscle tissue to determine the impacts of provisioning on the trophic signatures and ranging behaviour of sharks in this population. A small number of large sharks monopolised more than 50% of the bait on offer. These 'fed' individuals showed significant 15N enrichment in their tissues compared to conspecifics of the same size that failed to obtain bait at the feeding site, and un-provisioned sharks from a control site. Despite the disparity in trophic signatures, fed, unfed and control sharks exhibited similar degrees of residency at their respective home receiver sites, and travelled similar daily minimum distances. Thus, despite long-term provisioning of this Caribbean reef shark population, there is no evidence for shifts in the behaviours considered which might affect the ecological role of these sharks. However, further research is required to examine potential indirect effects of shark provisioning on sympatric fauna and habitat before this activity can be placed within a sustainable marine conservation framework. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Habitat alteration has major impacts on biodiversity, but we do not fully understand how changes in vegetation structure alter community interactions among vertebrate predators and their prey. Desertification is a major threat to degraded steppe habitats, prompting re-vegetation efforts to slow wind erosion. These processes alter both the structure and composition of the vegetation, and thus could influence predator and prey abundances, and their interactions. We investigated how habitat structure (degraded [sparse], natural [intermediate], or re-vegetated [dense]) influences lizard species richness, abundance, and diversity, and the interactions between these predators and invertebrate prey in the arid desert steppe. Structurally sparse and dense vegetation supported higher lizard abundances than natural habitats, with Phrynocephalus frontalis and Eremias argus dominating sparse and dense habitats respectively, and P. frontalis and E. multiocellata co-dominating natural habitats. Habitats that were structurally dense also supported the most complex trophic interactions among predators and prey, whereas structurally sparse habitats had low interaction diversity and interaction evenness, with most energy flowing along few trophic pathways. Steppe degradation therefore simplifies community trophic interactions, and restoration through enhanced protection of natural steppe habitat structure may play an important role in the conservation of healthy predator-prey communities. Desertification is a pressing issue throughout most of the arid steppe; revegetation efforts resulted in robust communities, in addition to promoting persistence of E. argus, which is endemic and threatened. Maintaining a heterogenous structural landscape thus may be the most promising way to combat desertification while at the same time restoring predator-prey community composition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Habitat restoration has become an important part of biodiversity conservation in the face of extensive habitat loss and fragmentation, especially in agricultural landscapes. Study of invertebrates such as beetles (Coleoptera) may be important to assess the effectiveness of restoration techniques in maintaining native fauna, because they provide a variety of trophic roles and ecosystem services. In this study we examined the conservation value for beetles of revegetation in linear strips and alongside remnant patches compared with remnant vegetation and cleared roadsides. We also assessed how habitat variables structured beetle community composition. Beetle species richness and abundance did not substantially differ between revegetated, remnant and cleared areas, and was not substantially influenced by vegetation type and structure. Herbivorous beetles and the family Curculionidae were more species rich in cleared linear strips. Beetle fauna in these agricultural landscapes may be a robust subset of the pre-clearing beetle community, possibly due to the widespread degradation of remnant areas and the ground layer habitats within them. One beetle species had slightly higher abundance in remnant linear strips, suggesting that remnant habitats may be important for some beetle species. Importantly, environmental variables strongly influenced beetle community composition, signifying that beetle communities are still responding to factors such as soil type and native vegetation, rather than variables mainly associated with land management. The restoration practices currently being undertaken in agricultural areas may not maintain beetle species that require specific habitat variables to survive. Ground-layer attributes need to be included in future revegetation projects, and translocation of specialist species of beetles may be required to restore communities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Despite rampant coastal development throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific, studies of conservation genetics and ecology of vulnerable, coastal species are rare. Large bodied vertebrates with highly specialized habitat requirements may be at particular risk of extinction due to habitat degradation and fragmentation, especially if these habitats are naturally patchily distributed, marginal, otherwise geographically limited, or associated in space with high human population densities or heavy anthropogenic disturbance. Particularly telling examples of these conservation challenges are large Australasian reptiles with obligate habitat requirements for lowland, coastal and mangrove forests. Plagued by habitat destruction due to high human densities along coastlines, sprawling rural development, and rapidly developing estuarine fisheries industry, coastal forest reptiles are experiencing rapid declines. And yet studies of population biology, genetics, and habitat requirements of species depending on these environments are few. We undertook the present study in order to take a multifaceted approach to understanding a poignant conservation problem. We identify significant evolutionary units for conservation in large-bodied sailfin lizards (genus Hydrosaurus), model suitable habitat in the Philippines from extensive occurrence data and evaluate the efficacy of the current protected area network, and identify the source of hydrosaurs in the illegal pet trade. We determine that the extent of the species' habitat coincident with protected areas is low. Our forensic evaluation of the illegal pet trade in the Philippines determines the existence of a natural population that is at risk of systematic exploitation by traders. Together, this integrative study characterizes a conservation urgency of particular significance: the genetically distinct sailfin lizards of the Bicol faunal region, with suitable habitat virtually unprotected, and clear evidence of heavy exploitation for illegal trade. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first conservation genetic study to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the protected landscape coverage in the Philippines, a Megadiverse nation and Biodiversity Hotspot. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Despite this, little is known about the impact fire regimes have on this resource, or the role topography may play in preserving hollows through the mitigation of fire intensity. This study examined the effect different combinations of fire frequency and topography have on (i) the number of hollow bearing logs and (ii) the presence and size of hollows within logs. The influence of wildfire severity and logging were also examined. Hollow availability (i.e. density of hollow bearing logs and hollow presence within logs) was greatest at sites burnt at 'low' frequency. The density of hollow logs was greater in gullies, though the effect of fire frequency did not vary with topographic position. Hollows showing signs of internal fire charring typically had a greater entrance width than unburnt hollows, which suggests fire plays an important role in creating large hollows. The number of hollow bearing logs increased with logging intensity, due to unmerchantable timber being left in situ. Wildfire severity had little effect on log hollows. The results indicate that frequent burning may reduce hollow availability, though it is likely that gullies will still retain a high density of hollow bearing logs irrespective of burning, and may play an important role in preserving connectivity of this resource across landscapes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Impacts of migration barriers on fish assemblages depend primarily on the location of each barrier within the river network and migration needs of regional fish fauna. This study examined how temporal and spatial patterns in the distribution and composition of fish assemblages was associated with varying estuarine connectivity and migration barriers in higher altitude reaches in the eastern Hunter River catchment, temperate Australia. Species richness and abundances of diadromous species were expected to be greater in a tributary catchment with unrestricted connectivity to the Hunter River estuary when compared to a neighbouring tributary catchment with restricted connectivity. Six diadromous species were sampled only, or in greater abundances, in the unrestricted tributary when compared to the restricted tributary. As a consequence, assemblage composition in the restricted tributary was dominated by non-diadromous species. Greater abundances of the amphidromous Cox's gudgeon (Gobiomorphus coxii) were sampled in the unrestricted tributary following their estuarine-freshwater upstream juvenile migration period when compared to the restricted tributary. Differences in the accumulations of migratory species immediately downstream of upland barriers between the two levels of estuary connectivity indicate that migration barriers in lowland reaches have significant effects throughout the entire catchment. Results of this study indicate that the location of each barrier to migration within river networks has varying consequences for catchment-scale connectivity loss and assessing the impacts of multiple barriers. Determining the effects and most appropriate management of migration barriers requires that all obstructions within a river network are recognised, as multiple barriers can have cumulative and interacting consequences for freshwater fish fauna, especially diadromous species. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Tree hollows are a critical, yet potentially limiting habitat resource for many animal species. Fire influences hollow availability, and the associated indirect effects on fauna can threaten the persistence of hollow-dependent species in fire-prone systems. We investigated the influence of two temporal aspects of fire regimes (time-since-fire, inter-fire interval) on hollow occurrence in a semi-arid, fire-prone region in south-eastern Australia. Empirical data on the characteristics of hollow-bearing eucalypt stems and fire-history attributes were compiled for 581 study sites. Mixed models were used to examine the relative influence of time-since-fire and inter-fire interval on hollow occurrence. Time-since-fire and inter-fire interval both affected the probability of hollow occurrence, but in different ways. Time-since-fire influenced the occurrence of hollows in live and dead stems. As time-since-fire increased, so too did the probability of live and dead stems containing hollows. Live stems did not provide hollows before 40. years post-fire, while the probability of dead stems containing hollows peaked at 50-60. years. Inter-fire interval influenced the availability of hollows in dead stems. Longer inter-fire intervals resulted in an increased density of dead hollow-bearing stems. In this region, hollow-dependent fauna will benefit from increased fire-free periods, both in terms of individual fire events and the intervals between repeated fires. These results highlight the complex way in which fire affects the availability of faunal habitat resources, and the extended time periods over which such influences operate. Understanding the effects of fire regimes on slow-developing habitat resources over long time-frames is imperative for sound ecological fire management. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Hunting is one of the greatest conservation challenges facing tropical wildlife. Wildlife in Indian tropical forests are vulnerable to hunting, although data on hunting impacts from the region are limited. We use a meta-analysis of 143 hunting studies from India to identify the species and geographic regions most at risk, and to assess their legal protection. We found evidence of hunting in 114 mammal species, with larger-bodied mammals being particularly vulnerable. Although 75% of all studies focused on mammals, few actually quantified hunting impacts. Further, among studies of all terrestrial vertebrates where hunting was mentioned, only 6% focused exclusively on hunting. With further research, we expect that the suite of species known to be exploited by hunters will increase. We conclude that the Eastern Himalaya and Indo-Myanmar biodiversity-hotspot complex is particularly vulnerable to hunting. Quantitative studies of hunting impacts are urgently needed across India, especially in this biodiversity-hotspot complex. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Explicitly recognizing the relative habitat value of prevalent land uses in comparison to forest will help improve conservation theory and practice in human-modified landscapes. To better understand how common land uses influence habitat quality and buffer forest fragments in tropical landscapes, we characterized reptile and amphibian assemblages across forest-pasture and forest-peach palm (palmito) ecotones in northeastern Costa Rica. We found that forest remnants contained significantly greater overall richness and abundance of reptiles and amphibians than either palmito or pasture; palmito supported greater species richness and abundance of herpetofauna than pastures. Assemblages of reptiles and amphibians in palmito also exhibited greater similarity to those found in forests than did assemblages in pasture, particularly for reptiles. Species exhibited distinctive responses to forest-land use ecotones, with some species reaching their highest abundances in non-forest habitat. Our results show that two important land uses in Costa Rica differ in their capacity to buffer forest patches and promote landscape connectivity for reptile and amphibian populations. Understanding these differences is crucial for identifying matrix environments that can complement the natural forest habitats of sensitive reptile and amphibian species. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Owing to habitat conversion and conflict with humans, many carnivores are of conservation concern. Because of their elusive nature, camera trapping is a standard tool for studying carnivores. In many vertebrates, sex-specific differences in movements - and therefore detection by cameras - are likely. We used camera trapping data and spatially explicit sex-specific capture-recapture models to estimate jaguar density in Emas National Park in the central Brazilian Cerrado grassland, an ecological hotspot of international importance. Our spatially explicit model considered differences in movements and trap encounter rate between genders and the location of camera traps (on/off road). We compared results with estimates from a sex-specific non-spatial capture-recapture model. The spatial model estimated a density of 0.29 jaguars 100km-2 and showed that males moved larger distances and had higher trap encounter rates than females. Encounter rates with off-road traps were one tenth of those for on-road traps. In the non-spatial model, males had a higher capture probability than females; density was estimated at 0.62 individuals 100km-2. The non-spatial model likely overestimated density because it did not adequately account for animal movements. The spatial model probably underestimated density because it assumed a uniform distribution of jaguars within and outside the reserve. Overall, the spatial model is preferable because it explicitly considers animal movements and allows incorporating site-specific and individual covariates. With both methods, jaguar density was lower than reported from most other study sites. For rare species such as grassland jaguars, spatially explicit capture-recapture models present an important advance for informed conservation planning. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Worldwide declines in wetland birds and turtles are attributed to landscape-scale habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and anthropogenic land use. However, due to multi-collinearity, the relative importance of these factors is largely unknown. We evaluated the relative effects of wetland amount, wetland configuration (measured as the number of wetland patches), and matrix composition (measured as the amount of forest, cropland and road density) on the occurrence of eight declining wetland bird species and two threatened freshwater turtles across 66-70 landscapes. We selected landscapes to minimize correlations among the landscape-scale predictors and to represent the range of variation in each predictor available in the study region. For wetland birds, we found that the amount of wetland at a landscape-scale was more important than the other landscape variables, whereas surprisingly for turtles, the amount of forest in the surrounding landscape was more important than the other landscape variables. Wetland configuration independent of wetland amount was not an important predictor of any species. This is the first study to assess the relative, independent effects of the landscape-scale factors thought to contribute to wetland bird and turtle declines. Our results confirm that wetland loss is the primary landscape-scale factor of wetland bird declines, but suggest that forest loss may play a greater role in freshwater turtle declines than previously realized; minimizing forest loss will have the most positive outcome for freshwater turtle conservation. Therefore, effective conservation planning requires a multi-taxa approach to meet landscape-scale requirements of all declining wetland fauna. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In southern Europe, traditional hunting has been frequently replaced by models based on more intensive management. These systems include management strategies like the release of farm-reared animals that can cause harmful effects on biodiversity. However, little is known about the hunters' views of this activity, and about their preferences for the ecological attributes of the hunting estates. We present the results of a choice experiment exercise evaluating the willingness to pay of Spanish hunters regarding different aspects of walked-up red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) shooting, including partridge quality (farm-reared vs. wild) and other attributes related to the ecological characteristics of the estate. We find that, when given the choice, hunting an additional wild partridge in a walked-up shooting day was valued more than 20. times higher than hunting an additional farm-reared bird. The diversity of small game available and the presence of natural vegetation in the landscape in which the walked-up hunting takes place were also significantly valued. Hunters also attributed economic value (albeit lower than other attributes) to the presence of protected non-game fauna in the estate. Overall, our results show that hunters are willing to pay more for hunting on estates that have better ecological characteristics, which may be indicative of good conservation status. This suggests that identifying and promoting such estates could lead to systems that are both ecologically and economically sustainable. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This review assesses the likely impacts of prehistoric megafaunal extinctions in the lowland tropics and discusses the implications for contemporary conservation management. The most likely impacts include: the coextinction of parasites, a reduction in environmental heterogeneity, the release of competitors and prey (including plants), and a loss of quality and quantity in seed dispersal services. This, however, is based largely on arguments by analogy with the surviving megafauna, since the impacts of megafaunal losses are compounded in the paleoenvironmental record with changes in climate and other human impacts. Suggested conservation responses include: prioritizing the conservation of the surviving megafaunal species and reintroducing them, where possible, into parts of their former ranges; reversible experiments with the introduction of taxon substitutes outside their natural ranges; and special conservation attention to megafaunal-dependent orphans and anachronisms. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The relatively low population size and long adult lifespan of dragonflies (Odonata, Anisoptera) makes them one of the few non-vertebrate groups likely to be impacted by direct roadway mortality. We studied adult dragonfly mortality and behavior associated with roadways for a number of species. Daily mortality rates for dragonflies were estimated from standardized surveys along predetermined lengths of roads. Relative abundance and flight behavior around and across roadways, a potentially important mortality factor, was determined from timed roadside observations. Observed flight behavior provided no evidence that roads act as significant barriers to dispersal for adult dragonflies. Estimated mean number killed ranged from 2 to 35 dragonflies/km/day. Species varied greatly in their susceptibility to motor vehicles. Two species (Plathemis lydia and Libellula luctuosa) made up more than 70% of the dead dragonflies collected, but only represented 14% and 31% of live dragonflies observed, respectively. The relatively low flight heights of these two species over roads (typically under 2. m) may explain their susceptibility; however, another common species (Tramea lacerata) also exhibited low flight height but did not experience high mortality, possibly because of its increased flight agility. Large numbers of adult dragonflies were killed over the entire flight season by motor vehicle collisions, exhibiting the need for assessing the long-term impact of roadway mortality on dragonfly population dynamics. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we investigate the relative roles of extrinsic threats and intrinsic biological traits in determining extinction risk in the lizard fauna of New Zealand. Consistent with the results of previous studies on mammals and birds, we find that habitat specialization, body size and geographic range size are the strongest predictors of extinction risk. However, our analyses also reveal that lizards that occupy areas with high levels of annual rainfall and are exposed to exotic predators and high human population densities are at greater risk. Thus, while the intrinsic traits that render species prone to extinction appear largely congruent across vertebrate taxa, our findings illustrate that both extrinsic threats and intrinsic traits need to be considered in order to accurately predict, and hence prevent, future population declines. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing use of indicator taxa to predict spatial patterns in other taxa, yet it is unclear how well species from one taxonomic group may serve as indicators of species richness in other groups with different ecological needs. We analysed spatial patterns of diversity in several arthropod taxa from the Turkish fauna (Scorpiones, Chilopoda, Coleoptera Cicindelidae, Hydrophilidae (gen. Laccobius), Nitidulidae, Tenebrionidae Pimeliini, Chrysomelidae Cryptocephalinae, and Lepidoptera Hesperioidea and Papilionoidea) to test whether there are multi-group hotspots or whether different groups have different areas of maximum diversification. We used three metrics of diversity: species richness, residuals from the species-area relationship, and species/area ratios. In each group, the three metrics were significantly positively correlated. However, the hotspots identified using one metric show small agreement with those identified by other metrics. Although patterns of cross-taxon diversity were significantly and positively correlated for all metrics, hotspots of different groups show little overlap. Moreover, proportions of non-target species captured by hotspots of a target taxon were usually moderate. On the other hand, we found that hotspots of certain groups tend to be concentrated in particular regions, and some groups were good surrogates for others. The Mediterranean and Central and Eastern Anatolian ecogeographic regions included hotspots of species richness for most taxa. Using the species/area ratios, all groups had at least one hotspot in the Marmara and Eastern Black Sea regions, and most groups also in the Mediterranean and Eastern Anatolian regions. Hotspots identified using the residuals from the species-area relationship are concentrated mostly in the Eastern and Central Anatolian regions. These results are explained with reference to the historical biogeography of the study area, the ecological needs of the different taxa and compared with the distribution of National Parks. For an effective conservation approach, we advocate the use of subsets of species as surrogates for all species, provided that selected subsets are representative of animals with different ecological needs and biogeographical histories. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Human-induced changes negatively affect all components of freshwater ecosystems and comprise the major cause of global loss of diversity and the biotic homogenization of freshwater faunas. The high diversity of dragonflies in heavily industrialized areas is therefore paradoxical, to say the least. We compared diversity of dragonflies in three main freshwater habitat types (natural and human-made) occurring in Upper Silesia (Central Europe). We used multivariate methods and diversity indices for a general analysis, comprising both species richness and the species composition of assemblages. We recorded 50 species in mine subsidence pools from the total of 54 sampled species. These included a high proportion of habitat specialists (typically threatened species). We emphasize that secondary habitats (e.g. spontaneously originated mine subsidence pools) should not a priori be regarded as ecological traps, because these often are the available habitats with highest quality. These habitats significantly outweigh ponds in species richness and proportion of habitat specialists. The conservation potential of specific secondary habitats lies in the fact that these habitats can substitute for very rare natural wetlands often restricted to higher elevations. We assume that high diversity in this type of secondary habitats is not random, but rather that it depends on environmental heterogeneity caused by a specific allogenic succession process occurring as a direct consequence of mining. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Many river revitalization projects are currently under development, but we still lack proper assessments of their effects on biodiversity, especially regarding non-aquatic vertebrates. We analysed the progressive changes in habitat mosaics, and the demographic response of two rare species of wading birds along a Swiss section of the Rhone river over a period of three decades. During the period preceding revitalization, the diversity of the habitat mosaic had been steadily declining. This impoverishment could however be reverted after 1994, when the revitalization was initiated: in 2006, the re-established habitat matrix was more diverse than at any time during the previous 27. years. The formerly channelized stream underwent radical transformation as it mutated into a heterogeneous braided river boosting pioneer riverine habitats. This has led the two wading bird species to establish significantly more territories than before the revitalization operations. Population size of Actitis hypoleucos and Charadrius dubius increased by 83% and 20%, respectively, between 1995 and 2007. During the same period, A. hypoleucos declined dramatically in Switzerland as a whole, whilst C. dubius showed no distinct population trend. The response of the two waders may have resulted from an increase in the number of lateral arms of the river, where the availability of productive temporary ponds provides excellent foraging opportunities. A significant proportion of these habitats was created by a targeted extraction of sediments with the objective to promote biodiversity while maintaining economic activity and improving security against floods. This suggests that gravel exploitation is not incompatible with efficient river restoration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {We ask whether oceanic islands and equivalent-sized continental blocks, which we call here 'land islands', are similar or not in their species richness, number of range-restricted species, and in number of threatened species. We used sites in southern Africa and islands in the Western Indian Ocean. We chose dragonflies as they are taxonomically tractable, well surveyed, and provide a range of characteristics from narrow-range endemics to widely-spread and vagile opportunists. We then selected as many oceanic islands as possible where there were sufficient data to make comparisons with land islands of a similar area in African savanna, grassland and mountains rich in endemic species. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to analyse the overall, range-restricted and threatened species richness for all islands (both oceanic and land) and then for the two types of island separately. Species richness increased with island size, with oceanic and land island size relationships being similar. Land islands overall had significantly more range-restricted species. Species on land islands were as threatened as those on oceanic islands. However, the land islands of the Western Cape were under a higher level of threat than oceanic islands of comparative size. The large islands of Madagascar and Sri Lanka were outliers with very high levels of threat. Translated into conservation, the results illustrate that over-generalizations about island faunas being more threatened than continental ones are not necessarily valid. While not wishing to draw attention away from the urgent conservation action needed on many tropical islands, we argue that comparisons of oceanic versus land islands detract from the more urgent task of local conservation action based on the special needs of any particular area, whether land or oceanic. It is more meaningful to establish how threats operate and how to mitigate them on small populations rather than focusing purely on any particular island type per se. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Despite containing around a third of all vertebrates, area-based approaches to conservation planning rarely include freshwater species as an explicit target for conservation. Here we describe and apply a globally applicable methodology comparable to those for other groups (i.e. Important Bird Areas) to identify river and lake catchments that represent, or contain, freshwater Key Biodiversity Areas. We discuss the rationale behind the methodology and propose appropriate definitions and quantitative threshold values for the selection criteria. Thresholds are developed through spatial analysis of species information for four comprehensively assessed freshwater taxonomic groups in continental Africa, comprising 4203 species, as recently assessed for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™. To illustrate application of the methodology freshwater Key Biodiversity Areas are identified across continental Africa, and conservation planning software used to prioritise a network of catchments that captures 99% of the total species complement within catchments covering ca. 20% of the total land area. Within these prioritised catchments only 19% of river length falls within existing Protected Areas suggesting that, given the high connectivity within freshwater ecosystems and their dependence upon catchment management for effective conservation, modification or expansion of the protected area network is required to increase effective conservation of freshwater species. By applying this methodology, gaps in the coverage of freshwater species by existing Protected Areas can be identified and used to inform conservation policy and investment to ensure it is inclusive of, and effective for, freshwater biodiversity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, we evaluated the effect of sample processing on the detection of a species' environmental DNA in the water.

The detection of Common Carp DNA was lower in samples that were frozen and thawed than in samples that were not, even though there was no difference in the DNA concentration, which was included with the DNA undetectable samples. In both types of samples, the DNA detection rate tended to be higher in a 2-μL volume of template DNA solution than in a 5-μL volume. DNA was detected in all non-frozen samples that were analyzed using a 2-μL template, both in three wells (three PCR replicate reactions per sample) with 40 PCR cycles and in eight wells with 55 cycles. The detection of Common Carp DNA in samples that were frozen and thawed was likely to increase through the use of the TaqMan Environmental Master Mix, which is used recently to efficiently release PCR inhibition. Our results suggest that environmental DNA detection is influenced by the processing of water samples after collection and by PCR reaction conditions. Use of non-frozen samples and a smaller DNA solution are recommended for detection of environmental DNA with quantitative PCR assays. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Structurally complex forest provides important habitat for a diverse array of vertebrate fauna. Frequent fire can simplify forest structure, though topographic mitigation of fire effects could potentially preserve structurally more complex habitat within certain topographic locations of fire prone landscapes. Our study assessed whether the effects of fire frequency on forest structure (tree hollows, log volume, vegetation complexity) varied with topographic position. The effect of wildfire severity and intensive logging were also examined. Frequent fire reduced vegetation cover on ridges, but not in gullies. The risk of collapse (i.e. presence of fire scars) increased for large trees on frequently burnt ridges, but remained suppressed in gullies. Crown fire reduced hollow presence in dead trees (i.e. snags), but increased hollow presence in trees with a healthy crown. The volume of extensively decomposed logs was three times greater in gullies than ridges, but was unaffected by fire frequency. Intensive logging reduced the number of hollow bearing trees and increased the volume of extensively decomposed logs, though future declines in log volume are predicted due to bottlenecks in log input. Our results suggest that gullies may play a critical role in preserving structurally complex stands within frequently burnt temperate eucalypt forests. Protecting gullies from land clearing and intensive logging is likely to be an important step in maintaining key habitat features and associated fauna in these landscapes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, the broader spatial context of these studies is uncertain. This study aims to assess the extent and timing of change in mammal status across a broad area of northern Australia (the monsoonal tropics of the Northern Territory). Indigenous information about terrestrial native mammal fauna (excluding bats) was compiled from a large series of interviews conducted across Indigenous communities. A collection of mammal skins was used to help facilitate discussions and verify identifications. The resulting information was analysed with non-parametric statistics to test for changes in mammal status across different time periods, between different regions, and between different groups of mammal species. Declines were reported as extending from the earliest memory of Indigenous participants, but the rate of decline has increased recently. These changes were reported across all five regions within the broad study area and were greater for " critical weight range" species than for other species. Indigenous participants suggested several factors were associated with the changing status of species. The study's results reveal a pattern of widespread decline in the mammal fauna of the monsoonal tropics of northern Australia, thereby corroborating the conclusions of recent more local wildlife monitoring studies. The study also demonstrates the value and capability of Indigenous ecological knowledge to complement and corroborate more intensive and local scientific studies. The results reinforce concern for the conservation status of the mammal fauna of northern Australia. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Declines in the abundance of marine vertebrates are of considerable concern, especially when they occur in isolated locations relatively protected from most major anthropogenic disturbances. This paper reports on sustained declines in the abundance and diversity of sea snakes at Ashmore Reef, a renowned biodiversity hotspot in Australia's Timor Sea. Surveys conducted in eight years between 1973 and 2010 recorded the highest abundances (average 42-46 snakes day-1) and species richness (nine species) in 1973 and 1994. In 2002 abundance had declined by more than 50% (21 snakes day-1) and only five species were recorded. Since 2005 abundances have been consistently low (1-7 snakes day-1), with just two species, Aipysurus laevis andEmydocephalus annulatus, recorded in significant numbers. Despite extensive searches since 2005 (especially in 2010) five species of sea snake historically abundant at Ashmore Reef have not been sighted and are presumed to have become locally extinct. These species include three Timor Sea endemics Aipysurus apraefrontalis, Aipysurus foliosquama, Aipysurus fuscus, and one Australasian endemic Aipysurus duboisii. Declines in the abundance and diversity of sea snakes at Ashmore Reef cannot be attributed to differences in survey methods among years.

	abstract = {Wildlife in alpine ecosystems can be elusive and difficult to survey, yet knowledge of their distributions is critical as these habitats are threatened by climate change. Opportunistic "citizen science" observations submitted by hikers in remote alpine regions can be valuable, as coverage can be extensive compared to scientific field surveys. Here, we compare the performance of two regression and three machine learning statistical modeling approaches and an ensemble model to predict the distribution of the Vancouver Island subspecies of White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura saxatilis) based on two datasets: (1) field survey observations from radio-telemetry and call-playbacks, and (2) opportunistic citizen science observations submitted by hikers. Predictions of suitable habitat for the Vancouver Island subspecies varied from 370 to 1039km2 based on field survey observations and from 404 to 1354km2 based on public observations. All models had fair accuracy (kappa>0.45) when tested on an independent dataset, but Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models tended to over-predict ptarmigan occurrence, had the lowest accuracy, and were most sensitive to the type of response data used. All the machine learning modeling techniques differed little between the datasets. These comparable results are encouraging for the continued use of citizen science monitoring programs, which can save both time and expense while involving and educating the public about threatened species. We advocate the use of opportunistic citizen science data and machine learning modeling techniques (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, and Maxent) for predicting alpine vertebrate species distributions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Developing effective management strategies is essential to conservation biology. Population models and sensitivity analyses on model parameters have provided a means to quantitatively compare different management strategies, allowing managers to objectively assess the resulting impacts. Inference from traditional sensitivity analyses (i.e., eigenvalue sensitivity methods) is only valid for a population at its stable age distribution, while more recent methods have relaxed this assumption and instead focused on transient population dynamics. However, very few case studies, especially in long-lived vertebrates where transient dynamics are potentially most relevant, have applied these transient sensitivity methods and compared them to eigenvalue sensitivity methods. We use bison (Bison bison) at Badlands National Park as a case study to demonstrate the benefits of transient methods in a practical management scenario involving culling strategies. Using an age and stage-structured population model that incorporates culling decisions, we find that culling strategies over short time-scales (e.g., 1-5. years) are driven largely by the standing population distribution. However, over longer time-scales (e.g., 25. years), culling strategies are governed by reproductive output. In addition, after 25. years, the strategies predicted by transient methods qualitatively coincide with those predicted by traditional eigenvalue sensitivity. Thus, transient sensitivity analyses provide managers with information over multiple time-scales in contrast to the long time-scales associated with eigenvalue sensitivity analyses. This flexibility is ideal for adaptive management schemes and allows managers to balance short-term goals with long-term viability. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are being established across all marine regions but their validity for the conservation of highly mobile marine vertebrates has been questioned. We tested the hypothesis that French coastal MPAs primarily designed for coastal and benthic biota are also beneficial for the conservation of a pelagic seabird, the Vulnerable yelkouan shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan), an endemic species to the Mediterranean Sea. We used a vast spectrum of electronic devices (GPS, temperature-depth-recorders, satellite transmitters and geolocators) and stable isotopic analyses to study the year-round movements and the trophic status of yelkouan shearwaters from the Hyères archipelago (France). In addition we conducted large-scale ship and aircrafts observation surveys to investigate spatio-temporal density patterns of shearwaters (genus Puffinus) in the western Mediterranean Sea. This extensive investigation permitted the first comprehensive study of the at-sea ecology of yelkouan shearwaters showing strikingly coastal habits, partial migration, unsuspected diving capabilities (max dive depth of 30. m), and a broad diet ranging from zooplankton to small pelagic fish. Importantly, 31% of yelkouan shearwaters GPS positions associated with foraging, 38% of diving positions, and 27% of resting positions were within the three French MPAs during the breeding season. These high scores confirmed by year-round distribution derived from GLS, PTTs, at-sea and aerial observations, validated our hypothesis of the major importance of coastal MPAs for the conservation of yelkouan shearwater. Our case-study is therefore a major contribution to research efforts aiming at linking the spatial ecology of highly mobile marine vertebrates with effective conservation of marine biodiversity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {From childhood to adulthood we receive a lot of information on animal key species with a high charismatic value. Flagships species are also frequently used to raise awareness, stimulate conservation and to increase political support for conservation issues. Since flagship species do not, in many cases, represent the local ecological community, there is the risk that exotic species are more readily identified than local ones and this could be problematic, as knowledge is critical to promote conservation. Conservation is especially crucial on islands, where populations may be more prone to extinctions than in the mainland, and where isolation may favor endemism. To test the hypothesis that exotic species are better known than local ones, we surveyed high school children in the Balearic Islands, a biodiversity hot spot for conservation priorities. We quantified children's knowledge of native and exotic vertebrate groups by using a computer-aided multiple choices questionnaire. We found that exotic species are better known than local fauna, even when local fauna is broadly common or of greater conservation concern. We also found strong differences in knowledge between different vertebrate groups: the best known were mammals whereas fishes were the least known. Surprisingly, even if less known than mammals, local amphibians and reptiles were better known than exotic ones. Children's poor knowledge on the local fauna in relation to other exotic vertebrates may lead them to associate wildlife and its conservation with exotic species. We suggest increasing efforts on environmental education and focussing on direct experience of children in their local environment to increase their knowledge of the local fauna, and engage their interest in their own natural world. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Zimbabwe's Mid-Zambezi Valley is of global importance for the emblematic mega-fauna of Africa. Over the past 30. years rapid land use change in this area has substantially reduced wildlife habitat. Tsetse control operations are often blamed for this. In this study, we quantify this change for the Dande Communal Area, Mbire District, of the Mid-Zambezi Valley and analyse the contribution of three major potential drivers: (1) increase in human population; (2) increase in cattle population (and the expansion of associated plough-based agriculture), and; (3) expansion of cotton farming. Although direct effects of land use change on wildlife densities could not be proven, our study suggests that the consequences for elephant and buffalo numbers are negative. All three of the above drivers have contributed to the observed land use change. However, we found farmland to have expanded faster than the human population, and to have followed a similar rate of expansion in cattle sparse, tsetse infested areas as in tsetse free areas where cattle-drawn plough agriculture dominates. This implies the existence of a paramount driver, which we demonstrate to be cotton farming. Contrary to common belief, we argue that tsetse control was not the major trigger behind the dramatic land use change observed, but merely alleviated a constraint to cattle accumulation. We argue that without the presence of a cash crop (cotton), land use change would have been neither as extensive nor as rapid as has been observed. Therefore, conservation agencies should be as concerned by the way people farm as they are by population increase. Conserving biodiversity without jeopardising agricultural production will require the development of innovative technological and institutional options in association with policy and market interventions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Bats play an important role in ecosystems and are highly relevant as indicators of environmental change. Long-term monitoring of bat populations is therefore fundamental to verifying environmental change over time. Although in the past, significant declines in bat populations have been reported across Europe, only limited data are available from systematic monitoring schemes over long periods. In this study we use data from the National Bat Monitoring Programme, a citizen science scheme drawing on over 3500 volunteers, to estimate changes in populations across Great Britain for 10 bat species or species groups between 1997 and 2012. We demonstrate uniquely how data collected on relative abundance and activity of bats by volunteers at 3272 sites using standardised, multiple survey methods (counts at roosts and bat detector surveys using tuneable, heterodyne detectors) can be successfully utilised to produce statistically robust population indices for a large proportion of a country's bat fauna. All trends calculated, with the exception of one species (. Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), had sufficient power to detect Red Alert level declines. Our results reveal a generally favourable picture for bats over the monitoring period; all species showed a stable or increasing trend from at least one survey type, although for four species where there were multiple trends from different survey types, the trend directions did not agree (. Myotis nattereri, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Eptesicus serotinus). This study demonstrates that use of volunteer programmes can be successful in monitoring bat populations, provided that key features including standardised survey methods and volunteer training are incorporated. Some species that are more difficult to detect and identify may however require specialist surveillance techniques. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The butterfly fauna at Willow Slough, Yolo County, California has been censused for 32. years as part of a participatory citizen-science project, the Fourth of July Butterfly Count. While the utility of a once-a-year census as a monitoring tool is potentially compromised by lack of standardization in counting protocols and variation in observer skill, at Willow Slough these issues have been minimized.We examined the Willow Slough count data for trends in both faunal diversity and the probability of presence of individual species. During the study, the number of species observed at a visit declined by 39%. Regressions of per-visit species counts against time did not detect a statistically significant decline until year 24. In contrast, Fisher's α, a statistic designed to reduce sample-size bias, detected the decline as early as year 13. Twelve of the 24 species analyzed showed significant declines in probability of occurrence; a further nine exhibited negative but non-significant trends. Butterflies that overwinter as eggs or larvae were more likely to decline than those that overwinter as pupae or adults. Many species in decline at Willow Slough have also been observed less frequently at nearby sites which are monitored year-round, supporting the value of once-a-year monitoring. Although correlations with climatic data have been identified, they are too weak to account for the observed faunal decline. We suspect broader patterns of land use and habitat continuity are implicated in butterfly declines across the region.We conclude that once-a-year sampling, if properly and rigorously done, is in fact useful as a monitoring tool for butterfly faunas, and that Fisher's α is well suited to early detection of trends in repeated diversity sampling. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Effective conservation requires reliable data on the abundance and distribution of animals in space and time. During ship-based or aerial surveys for diving marine vertebrates such as sea turtles and marine mammals, a proportion of animals in a surveyed area will be missed because they are diving and out of view. While it is likely that dive and surface times vary with environmental conditions, such variation is rarely incorporated into survey-based research and its consequences for analyses of survey data are not well known. We quantified the effects of neglecting to account for variation in the dive-surfacing patterns of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) when analyzing boat-based survey data from a foraging ground in Western Australia. We found that analyses of turtle sightings data can be confounded by variation in the probability of turtles being at the surface where they are available for detection. For example, during the cold season in deeper areas in Shark Bay, green and loggerhead turtle density was underestimated by 45% and 21%, respectively, if extended dive times relative to population medians were not accounted for. These results have important implications for applications of survey data for a variety of taxa including other sea turtles, marine mammals and large sharks that are surveyed by boat or plane. Diving and depth use studies have much to contribute to the assessment and management of these groups, which include many species of conservation concern. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Current approaches in terrestrial biodiversity conservation focus predominantly on plants and vertebrates. While these groups account for less than 4% of the estimated global species richness, it is commonly argued that especially the species richness in higher plants is a suitable indicator of overall biodiversity. We tested this assumption, investigating species richness and equitability patterns in three highly species-rich insect families and their links with the vegetation and other environmental factors. Vegetation surveys were combined with pitfall and light trapping to establish the α-diversity of ground beetles, geometrid moths and arctiid moths on 48 plots at varying altitudes between Beijing and the Inner Mongolian Plateau. Soil pH and nutrient status were also recorded. The α-diversity patterns in the three insect families were non-congruent, and links with phytodiversity were weak. The spatial α-diversity patterns in each of the three insect families were significantly correlated with the species density of individual plant families. These links varied between the three insect taxa and were mostly negative in moths. Furthermore, geometrid moth diversity decreased with increasing elevation and decreasing soil pH. Strongly diverging α-diversity patterns across different insect taxa illustrate that it is impossible to find a simple surrogate representing cross-taxon diversity for these highly diverse groups. Furthermore, phytodiversity and vegetation composition appear to play a limited role in governing insect diversity patterns. These results underline the significant risk that current plant-focused approaches in terrestrial biodiversity conservation are inadequate in addressing the conservation needs of the vast majority of species on earth. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Bushmeat hunting is one of the primary threats to many large-bodied vertebrate species in African forests. However, species vary in their degree of vulnerability to hunting. We investigated the impact of hunting on monkey species in Cameroon's Korup National Park (KNP) and examined how vulnerability to hunting varies among species. Data on primate abundance and hunting intensity were collected along 10 line transects, distributed across three survey areas in KNP. We assessed how the relative abundance of seven monkey species spatially varied between heavily and lightly hunted areas and evaluated temporal changes in the relative abundance and proportional representation of these species at a single hunted forest site and in bushmeat harvests. The putty-nosed and mona monkeys are most tolerant to heavy hunting pressure whereas the crowned monkey, drill, and red colobus are among the most vulnerable. At our heavily hunted survey site, the overall relative density of monkey groups increased through time but primate species richness declined. The proportional representation of Cercopithecus species, especially putty-nosed monkeys, increased through time, possibly due to competitive release. We also observed an increase in the proportional representation of the putty-nosed and mona monkeys and a reduced percent contribution of the red colobus and drill in hunter harvests. We conclude that hunting is driving some of Africa's most threatened primate species (e.g., Preuss's red colobus and the drill) to local extinction in KNP. We discuss intrinsic factors of species that might influence their degree of vulnerability and strategies to improve protection efforts in KNP. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

D) as a weighted measure of dissimilarity between the current assemblage of a given location and a reference assemblage that represents a historical and/or unperturbed state. We analyzed the index by means of three case studies that included two empirical assessments of mammal communities in Neotropical rainforests and one hypothetical example, encompassing a variety of criteria to quantify differences in species density and importance. These cases illustrate the broad range of index applicability and show that incorporating functional differences among species, such as those based on body size, conservation status or evolutionary originality can add important information beyond simply species richness. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Declines in forest and woodland birds have largely been attributed to habitat loss and fragmentation. In the past decade, however, the potential for herbivores to influence bird species abundance and community composition via their direct impact on vegetation structure has also been recognised. We tested the hypothesis that deer influence vegetation structure and bird assemblages in a large island archipelago in western North America using surveys of 18 islands with deer densities ranging from 0 to over 1 deer/ha. Amongst these islands, reduced predation and hunting pressure has allowed deer populations to increase above those likely to have existed in pre-European times. Our results support a growing body of evidence that deer regulate both the cover and architecture of understory vegetation which in turn profoundly affects island bird assemblages. Deer-free islands supported the most abundant and diverse bird fauna. Iconic songbirds such as the rufous hummingbird, song and fox sparrow were abundant on islands with no deer but substantially reduced on islands with high deer densities. Only one bird species, the dark-eyed junco, preferred moderate and high density deer islands. Our observations suggest that current cohorts of palatable shrubs on islands with high deer densities are relatively old and potentially represent an impending extinction debt, where the full effects of high deer density on island biota may take decades to fully unfold. Our results suggest that deer densities below a threshold of 0.1 deer/ha should allow native vegetation to recover and a rich and diverse bird species assemblage to persist. We suggest that adaptive management be used to test the validity of this threshold, and that without active management of deer abundance, local extinctions of native flora and fauna appear likely to accelerate. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We report the results of a contingent study undertaken at three case-study sites: Azores islands (Portugal), Gulf of Gdansk (Poland) and Isles of Scilly (UK). The study considered species richness of five specific marine taxa (mammals, birds, fish, invertebrates and algae) as proxies of marine biodiversity and the aim of analysis was to estimate from a multi-site perspective public's willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid increased levels of species loss (reduction of species richness) for different marine taxa. Results, based on 1502 face-to-face interviews, showed that income, education and environmental awareness of the respondents were significant predictors of WTP for marine species conservation. Results also indicated that respondents in each of the European locations had different preferences for marine taxa. In the Azores, although mammals and fish were valued highly, small differences occurred in the WTP among different taxa. Respondents in the Isles of Scilly put a relatively low value on fish while algae and marine mammals were highly valued. In Gdansk, respondents defined a clear order of preference for marine mammals > fish > birds > invertebrates and algae. These findings suggested that cultural differences may be important drivers of valuation and undermines the commonly held premise that charismatic/likeable taxa consistently have a disproportionately strong influence on WTP for biodiversity conservation. We conclude that conservation policy must take account of cultural diversity alongside biological diversity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We used the seedling emergence method to assess impacts of invasion by an alien, clonal grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum) on endangered coastal swamp forest seed banks of eastern Australia. We asked: do impacts vary amongst native plant growth forms and dispersal strategies, and are impacts driven by propagule or recruitment limitationα Invasion was associated with significant reductions in seed bank species richness and increased dissimilarity between the seed bank and standing vegetation. The rate of species loss was more than two times greater within the standing vegetation than seed bank, however, indicating that the primary mechanism of community change is limited recruitment from the seed bank rather than a reduction in the arrival and storage of propagules to invaded sites. Overall, species losses were observed for herbs, graminoids and vertebrate-dispersed species, whilst wind and water dispersed and woody species were unaffected by invasion. Overall, seed banks were substantially richer than the standing vegetation across both invaded and non-invaded sites, indicating a high potential for unassisted reestablishment of a species-rich standing vegetation from the seed bank following S. secundatum removal, although one unlikely to resemble the original community in structure, function and identity of species. Differential impacts across functional groups may result in regenerating communities relatively dominated by woody species, which may prevent subsequent recolonisation by herbs and graminoids. Monitoring will be required to identify whether these and other species require assisted reintroduction. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The ED depends on the tree pattern, i.e. of a cladogram included into a time-scale.

	abstract = {Information on the demographic and genetic consequences of overexploitation of large marine vertebrates is often difficult to demonstrate on ecological time scales. We investigate the genetic impacts of recent commercial activities along Mexico's Pacific coast on the nesting colonies of a long-lived vertebrate of conservation concern, the olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea). This species was severely impacted by a commercial fishery between 1960 and 1990 (e.g.>350,000 individuals were caught in a single year), depleting important nesting areas within few decades. Microsatellite DNA variation of 334 samples representing 18 nesting sites revealed a clear signature of recent bottlenecks associated with changes in allelic diversity. Consistent with theoretical expectations and other empirical studies, we found no evidence for bottlenecks based on measures of heterozygosity. The bottleneck signal was strong across the highly connected metapopulation and also apparent in six nesting sites in a pattern consistent with the history of demographic disequilibria produced by their overexploitation. In addition, we clarify population structure across Mexico and show that Mismaloya, a key colony where human harvest led to a dramatic change in the species' reproduction mode, has not been supplemented by gene flow after the bottleneck and has diverged genetically from other demes. This is perhaps the first study to detect recent signatures of anthropogenic-driven population declines in sea turtles using genetics. This enables managers to consider information about genetic signatures of contemporary demographic changes during the development of conservation management plans and during population monitoring. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Conserving and managing populations of marine vertebrates can be complex when they occupy the waters of multiple nations, crossing heterogeneous legal and management landscapes. Hawksbill turtles (. Eretmochelys imbricata) are subject to varying levels of use in Caribbean countries and their conservation and management is complicated by the extent to which they are a 'shared' resource. In 1997 and 2000, Cuba attempted to 'downlist' hawksbills from Cuban waters to CITES Appendix II to allow limited international trade. The research on movement and dispersal of hawksbills reported here was undertaken to better inform discussion about the impacts of their harvest. Flipper tagging and satellite tracking demonstrate that the majority of study turtles remained in Cuban territorial waters. Of 1170 hawksbills tagged (525 adults and 606 juveniles), 12% (. n=. 143) were recaptured. All recaptured adults (. n=. 16 males, 38 nesting females and 30 adult females in-water) were in Cuban waters. Of the 59 juveniles recaptured, only four recaptures were outside Cuban waters (Nicaragua. =. 2, Colombia. =. 1, USA. =. 1). Fourteen hawksbills tagged in the waters of other nations were recaptured in Cuban waters. We also satellite tracked 21 turtles (one adult male, ten nesting females and ten non-nesting adult females), of which five tags failed, 11 stayed in Cuban waters for the duration of transmissions (1-809. days) and five foraged in the waters of other nations (Mexico . n=. 1 an adult female; Honduras . n=. 2, both post-nesting turtles; Colombia . n=. 1 an adult female; and the eastern Lesser Antilles . n=. 1, an adult male), with differences for nesting and non-nesting turtles. Our results, demonstrating extended site fidelity within Cuban waters, suggest that strengthening national management within national jurisdictions that host hawksbill turtles is fundamental to improving regional conservation as a whole. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The expansion of human activities is endangering megafauna in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. While large marine vertebrates are often vulnerable and emblematic species, many are considered to be declining, primarily due to fisheries activities. In the open ocean, certain fisheries improve their efficiency of detecting tuna schools by locating and fishing close to some macro-organisms, such as whale sharks or marine mammals. However, collecting accurate data on the accidental capture and mortality of these organisms is a complex process. We analyzed a large database of logbooks from 65 industrial vessels with and without scientific observers on board (487,272 and 16,096 fishing sets since 1980 and 1995 respectively) in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Distribution maps of Sightings Per Unit of Effort highlights major hotspots of interactions between the fishery and whale sharks in the coastal area from Gabon to Angola in the Atlantic from April to September, and in the Mozambique Channel in the Indian Ocean between April and May. The incidence of apparent whale shark mortality due to fishery interaction is extremely low (two of the 145 whale sharks encircled by the net died, i.e. 1.38%). However, these two hotspots presented a relatively high rate of incidental whale shark capture. Thus, we underline the importance of estimating long-term post-release mortality rates by tracking individuals and/or by photographic identification to define precise conservation management measures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {To improve effectiveness of protected areas, selection of priority areas should include consideration of three main components, namely special conservation elements, focal species and representation. We present a three-track approach related to these components for vertebrate conservation planning in Castilla-La Mancha, central Spain. As special conservation elements, we identified Priority Areas for Conservation of species using five criteria: species richness, geographic rarity, species vulnerability, a Combined Index of these three criteria, and a Standardised Biodiversity Index (SBI) that integrate the three criteria and four studied taxa. The Natura 2000 Network was used to include conservation areas for focal species. We evaluated the representation of every landscape type in the existing conservation areas. To delineate the spatial configuration for vertebrate conservation, we combined the identified Priority Areas for Conservation, existing conservation areas and connectivity areas by cost-distance analysis. The Combined Index was the most efficient criterion analyzed to identify Priority Areas for Conservation. The Natura 2000 Network showed a high percentage of coincidence with identified Priority Areas for Conservation, whereas the natural protected areas network had a low percentage of coincidence. Six agricultural landscapes were inadequately represented in the current conservation network. According to our multi-track approach, ∼29% of study area was required to capture 100% of vertebrate species and all landscape types. Our results show that the existing conservation areas are insufficient to guarantee the conservation of biodiversity in the study region. Additional areas with outstanding features of diversity, connectivity areas, and establishment of targets for off-reserve conservation are of fundamental importance for strengthening biodiversity conservation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Prior scientific knowledge inspires ecological research, hypotheses and debate but is rarely used explicitly to formulate predictive models. Bayesian statistics provide a formal way to include informative priors and evaluate their influence on parameter estimates. We use case studies of the influence of overabundant deer on bird species abundance in the Gulf Island, San Juan and Haida Gwaii archipelagos of western North America to demonstrate the utility of informative priors and Bayesian modelling to determine the consequences of overabundance. We found that by including informative priors about deer browsing impacts on bird species from a study undertaken in Haida Gwaii, the precision of estimates from a similar study undertaken in the Gulf and San Juan archipelagos could be significantly increased. Uncertainty about regional ecological impacts underpins many agencies failure to take management actions. We demonstrate here, that informative priors, when used logically and transparently, can be a highly cost effective way to increase understanding of ecological processes. In some cases, it may be the only way to inform decision-making when scarce resources limit support for long term field research or the threat is sufficiently great that immediate action is required. For several bird species examined here, the inclusion of informative priors strengthened the conclusion that their populations were negatively affected by changes in vegetation structure caused by deer browsing. Our findings suggest that deer browsing in these island archipelagos must be managed if the risk of local extinctions among native flora and fauna is to be avoided. © 2013 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Invasive plants can eliminate native flora and ultimately have negative indirect effects on fauna and the functional ecology of ecosystems, but understanding of these cascading effects on arthropod assemblages is poor. Desert spring habitats are small, isolated landscape elements that are literal oases for flora and fauna and support high diversity assemblages; invasive palms can colonize desert springs and form monocultures. In an effort to understand effects of these invasive trees on higher terrestrial trophic levels at springs, we contrasted assemblage structure of terrestrial arthropods in native vegetation versus invasive palm habitat. We sampled arthropods in paired palm and native habitat at 10 springs in Death Valley National Park, California, USA, during both spring and fall growing seasons using suction sampling. The invading palms Phoenix dactylifera L. and Washingtonia filifera (Linden ex André) supported a mean of only one-sixth of the arthropod abundance, one-third of the species richness, and half the family richness of native habitat. Almost all orders were less abundant in palms, and most families and species were either absent or virtually absent in palm habitat. Both live and dead palm leaves were depauperate, and season and block effects were minimal. Impacts of these visually striking invasives clearly go beyond monopolization of ground cover, and invading palms appear capable of reshaping the functional ecology of desert springs. If control efforts are undertaken, we recommend complete removal of palms, because killed but standing " ghost palms" and associated thatch persist for many years and will continue to provide poor arthropod habitat and prevent native plant establishment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Global and project-level biodiversity indicators have received considerable attention, but indicators of the conservation actions and impacts of programmes and institutions appear to be under-developed. The IUCN Red List Index (RLI) has potential to be a useful indicator at an organizational-level to evaluate long-term impact of conservation on the extinction risk of species, thereby supporting institutional decision-making and communications. However, it has not yet been tested for its utility in tracking changes in extinction risk of a set of species targeted specifically by an individual conservation agency. Here, we examine the feasibility of using the RLI as one metric of the conservation impact of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, a conservation charity which runs multi-decadal programmes on a modest number of globally threatened terrestrial vertebrate species. Of 17 target amphibian, bird and mammal species, eight underwent improvements in Red List category (reductions in extinction risk) owing to conservation. This drove a 67% increase in the value of the Red List Index between 1988 and 2012. This contrasts with a 23% decline in a counterfactual RLI showing projected trends if conservation had been withdrawn in 1988. For organizations that target sets of species with circumscribed geographic distributions and that are regularly assessed by the IUCN Red List, the RLI is a useful indicator for measuring and demonstrating long-term conservation impact to technical and non-technical audiences. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {While species diversity patterns at large scales (continental to global) have been increasingly studied recently for a few well-known taxa, only a few studies have included less well-known groups, and analysed congruence patterns between taxa. By using data from nine taxonomic groups (vascular plants, bryophytes, mammals, birds, reptiles, freshwater fish, amphibians, butterflies, dragonflies) from 38 European countries and Israel, we analysed the diversity of five diversity subsets (numbers of native, endemic, threatened, extinct, alien species) and their cross-taxon species diversity congruency.Native species numbers, and particularly, endemic species numbers are highest in large south European countries (Spain, Italy, Greece). The highest numbers of species being currently nationally threatened are located in industrialized Central European countries, whereas the highest numbers of nationally extinct species are found in Israel, Luxembourg, and Belgium. Established alien species numbers are highest in large western and (south)western European countries (United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, France).Across all taxonomic groups, the average proportion of endemic species of total native species numbers is 3%, of threatened species it is 27%, of extinct species it is 2%, whereas established alien species make up on average 11% of native species numbers. Highest proportions of endemic species were found in fish, grasshoppers, and reptiles, of threatened species in reptiles, amphibians and dragonflies, of extinct species in fish, dragonflies and grasshoppers, and of established alien species in fish, mammals and amphibians. Pairwise cross-taxon correlations of species diversity were pronounced for native species and endemic species, whereas correlations are much weaker for threatened, extinct and alien species numbers. Species-area relationships were significant but relatively weak for numbers of native and established alien species, whereas not significant for the other diversity subsets.This study provides an important baseline assessment for a better understanding of European species diversity patterns. Future research avenues should aim at identifying causal relationships, and test for the effects of scale, life history and ecology of different taxa. Such an extended causal analysis should include historical effects, i.e. regional differences in rates of speciation, dispersal and extinction but also short-term fluctuations in human impact on species diversity, which are notoriously difficult to quantify, but frequently shape current diversity patterns. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In many cases, the designation of Protected Areas (PAs) is not based on biological information, particularly in tropical regions where such information is generally lacking. Thus it is unclear whether tropical PAs are well-placed for conserving biodiversity currently, or under future climate change. We used reserve-design software ('Zonation') to investigate current and future conservation value of PAs of Thailand (N=187 PAs, covering ∼20% of Thailand) in relation to forest-cover and butterfly diversity. Currently, PAs are about 2°C cooler than non-PAs because PAs tend to occur at higher elevation (66% of land above 1000m is protected compared with only 6% below 250m). Temperature is predicted to increase in Thailand in future, but PAs are predicted to remain ∼2°C cooler than non-PAs in future. We obtained modelled distribution data for 161 butterfly species (∼12% of national butterfly fauna), and used Zonation to rank areas (∼1km 2 grid resolution) based on species richness, complementarity, and forest cover. The conservation value of PAs was approximately twice that of non-PA areas, although many highly-ranked areas are not currently protected. The species richness of PAs was projected to decline by ∼30% in future, but the relative conservation rankings of individual PAs were projected to change very little. The preponderance of PAs in montane regions makes them well-placed to support forest species shifting from areas at lower elevation that become climatically unsuitable in future. By contrast, the conservation value of low-elevation PAs may decline in future if climate conditions become unsuitable for species. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {High mountain lakes are naturally fishless, although many have had introductions of non-native fish species, predominantly trout. Predation on native fauna by introduced trout involves profound ecological changes. The objective of this study was to reconstruct the historical process of trout introduction in 520 high mountain lakes >0.5. ha of the southern Pyrenees and quantify which particular factors either environmental or anthropogenic, best explained their present distribution and lake conservation status. The first written evidence of trout introductions dated back to 1371 AD. By 1900, trout had been introduced to 26.5% of lakes during preceding centuries. A subsequent wave of introductions began in 1960 when stocking led to trout becoming established in 52.5% of lakes. From 1900 to 1950, walking distance from nearby urban centres was the dominant factor explaining 29-60% of the variation in trout distribution, indicating that trout introductions were in lakes closer to human settlements. In contrast, with the onset of modern fish management that took place during the period 1960-2000, the most significant factors were both the management practices and lake characteristics which are likely related with the probability of survival of the fish populations. After 2000, the remaining fishless lakes were those of highest altitudes, and the shallowest and those with the lowest surface area. The recent fishing ban in protected areas of National Parks has resulted in a stabilization of the number of lakes with fish, suggesting that this is the only reliable management policy to avoid new introductions and preserve the conservation status of high mountain lakes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The study of road mortality rates is important to identify species in need of detailed population evaluation, to determine the effectiveness of mitigation measures or to identify road network sections or road stretches where to concentrate mitigation actions. However, the impacts of roads on vertebrate mortality are usually underestimated, since detection probability and removal rates are not considered when road-kill magnitude is evaluated. In this paper, we present differential equations to estimate road-kill mortality rates taking into account carcass detectability and removal rates. The equations presented consider the periodicity and sampling methods normally used in road mortality studies and we discuss the recommended formulae to each sampling context. To exemplify outcomes of each equation we used a data set obtained during a one-year monitoring of vertebrate road-kills in southern Brazil. Our results show that there are differences in carcass detectability and removal rates among different taxonomic and body size groups. For reptiles and birds, respectively, we estimated mortality rates two and 39 times larger when considering carcass removal and detectability. Although our mortality estimates may be affected by some possible biases in sampling detection probability and removal rates, our main goal in this study was to provide a mathematical alternative to incorporate those error sources in road-kill estimates. We believe that the proposed mathematical models, by properly estimating road-kill magnitude, represent a substantial step towards an adequate evaluation of road impacts on wildlife. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Plantation clearcuts represent an important habitat for many open-area wildlife species - including conservation-concern species - in landscapes dominated by industrial forests. However, due to the ephemeral nature of clearcuts, species using this type of environment face a " shifting mosaic" in which their ability to successfully relocate to another habitat patch may play a crucial role in the species' persistence in the landscape. Although several studies have shown a positive effect of patch size on the persistence of open-habitat species, forest clearcutting represents a special case in which, on average, larger patches also tend to be more isolated from each other, likely creating a trade-off between area and isolation effects. We developed an individual-based spatially-explicit model to test the effect of clearcut size (a critical management variable in plantation forestry) on the persistence of generic early-successional wildlife species in a landscape dominated by forest plantations. We simulated a landscape covered with a plantation harvested regularly over a 25-year rotation and different versions of a wildlife population whose habitat was constituted only by 1-4. year-old patches. We observed that when the species could perceive the attributes of the neighboring pixels persistence time was higher at intermediate clearcut sizes agreeing with our prediction. Also, species with a high dispersal capacity were less limited by connectivity and reached their maximum persistence at higher clearcut sizes. Results also showed a positive effect of habitat lifetime on persistence. Our results suggest large clearcuts may be incompatible with the conservation of many early-successional vertebrates that have limited dispersal capacity, unless additional conservation measures, such as the use of corridors or special spatial arrangement of clearcuts, are taken to overcome the lack of connectivity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Globally, bird numbers are declining, with potentially serious flow-on effects on ecosystem processes, such as seed dispersal mutualisms. However, management to maintain seed dispersal may be inappropriate if unexpected animals are the most important dispersers. Numbers of the world's only alpine parrot, the New Zealand kea (Nestor notabilis), have declined drastically over the last 120. years after an intense period of official persecution. Today <5000. kea remain in the wild. Previously it has been assumed that like other parrots, kea would destroy most of the seeds they eat, thereby contributing little to seed dispersal. The New Zealand alpine flora is rich in fleshy-fruited species yet has a limited disperser fauna. Consequently, we investigated the relevance of kea as a seed disperser in New Zealand's alpine ecosystems. Field-based foraging observations coupled with faecal analyses showed kea were by far the most important extant alpine avian frugivore. Kea selected more fruiting species (21 vs. 17. species), consumed more fruit, and dispersed more seeds (8137 vs. 795) than all other birds combined. Rates of seed predation by kea were extremely low, and evident in only 25% of species eaten. Kea are the only species that make frequent long-distance flights within and between mountain ranges. Hence, much of the effective long-distance dispersal of the alpine flora may be currently performed by kea. Conservation of kea is therefore important both for ensuring the survival of the species and for their role in seed-dispersal mutualisms for which there are few extant substitutes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), causes the disease chytridiomycosis in amphibians and is responsible for the worst epizootics in vertebrate history. In some regions of the world (e.g., the Neotropics and Western United States), Bd has caused recent reductions in amphibian population abundance and species richness, while in other regions the impacts are less clear. Although Bd is present in the Midwestern United States, its history and impact in the region is not known. We used a qPCR assay to determine historic Bd prevalence in Illinois, testing 1028 specimens representing 10 anuran species, collected 1888-1989. We used two complementary sets of samples to first assess historic prevalence with the primary set, and used a secondary set to confirm Bd presence and examine older samples with a more sensitive technique. Prevalence varied among species; in the primary dataset of 1008 samples extracted with PrepMan Ultra collected 1892-1989, Bd was found in four species (11.1%, CI: 9.3-13.2%). Rana (. Lithobates) sphenocephala, the southern leopard frog, had the highest prevalence (38.3%, CI 32.7-44.2%); prevalence among other infected species was <7%. Overall prevalence was <10% in most decades but >40% in the 1940s. In the secondary set of 50 samples extracted with Qiagen Blood and Tissue Kits (30 re-swabbed of the original 1008 and 20 additional older specimens), 17 of the 20 additional samples were Bd+ (85.0%, CI 64.0-94.8%) including the oldest Bd+ specimen, which was collected in 1888. We confirmed Bd presence by sequencing 42 Bd+ samples and found ≥99% homology with Bd sequences in Genbank. By 1900, Bd was geographically widespread throughout Illinois-40. years earlier than the current oldest estimate in the U.S.-meaning that Illinois amphibians have been coexisting with Bd for at least 126. years. This long period of coexistence from our results raises new questions about the history of Bd in North America, possible coevolution between host and pathogen, and the potential role of Bd in historic population declines. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Regional-scale biodiversity indicators provide important criteria for the selection of protected areas in conservation, but their application is often hindered by a lack of taxonomic knowledge. Moreover, different indicators include different types of information, sometimes leading to divergent conservation priorities. Madagascar tops the world list of biodiversity hotspots and much conservation effort has been directed toward its threatened plants and vertebrates. In contrast, its highly diverse freshwater invertebrate fauna has received comparatively little conservation attention. We conducted an inventory of Malagasy adephagan water beetles (Coleoptera, Dytiscidae, Noteridae, Gyrinidae, Haliplidae) using a combined morphological and molecular approach. In total, 2043 beetles from 153 sites were sequenced for cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1), and species delimitation was carried out using the coalescent-based GMYC model. Phylogenetic relationships of the resulting entities were established using cox1 combined with partial 16S rRNA and 28S rRNA sequences. Ten national parks were assessed for their species richness, phylogenetic diversity (PD) and endemism. We were particularly interested in the contribution of endemic species to PD. Congruence between molecular and taxonomic identifications was high (91%), with 69% of sampled species endemic to Madagascar. Interestingly, we found that PD at a site was negatively correlated to the proportion of endemic species, most likely because endemics are the result of recent radiations with relatively little branch-length contribution to the measure of PD. This suggests that ranking sites for conservation priority based solely on PD potentially disfavor endemic species by underrating areas where the evolutionary process is most active. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Secondary vegetation, associated with changes in land use, presents a conservation issue in the preservation of biological diversity in agricultural landscapes. We examine the interactive effect of eucalypt regrowth and rock habitat on reptile species richness and assemblage structure in fragmented agricultural landscapes in south-eastern Australia. Zoogeographic and geomorphic factors influenced species richness and community composition. Saxicolous and arboreal species were less abundant in grassy woodland regrowth, whereas Bassian and fossorial species responded positively to forest regrowth (and tree plantings). Regrowth with rock habitat had higher reptile richness, and more old growth-associated taxa, than regrowth without rock habitat. Thus, the presence of saxicolous habitat can reduce the time required for regrowth to attain a climax community structure and elements of old growth fauna. However, in the absence of vegetation management, secondary vegetation can reduce habitat suitability for a broad range of reptiles. In agricultural landscapes historically supporting savannah-like vegetation, habitat manipulation may be necessary to maintain reptile diversity. Furthermore, tree plantings in temperate agricultural landscapes should aim to restore historical vegetation composition and structure, thereby reflecting the habitat requirements of extant species and facilitating evolutionary processes. In grassy woodland ecosystems, this may involve heterogeneous plantings which emulate natural levels of canopy cover and solar penetration. Maintaining biodiversity in agricultural landscapes will therefore involve managing trade-offs to preserve areas of dense regeneration for regrowth-dependant fauna, while at the same time, creating open-canopy environments to enhance habitat for ectothermic organisms. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Restoration of woodlands that have been invaded by exotic plants has primarily focused on restoring vegetation structure by removing invaders and planting native species that have declined in abundance. Management practices to date continue to focus on plant communities, but if restoring ecosystem integrity is the goal of restoration, knowledge of how the fauna has recovered is essential. We examined the impact of vegetation restoration and management on the surface-active arthropod community across a spectrum of 22 woodland sites in the greater metropolitan Chicago region. Sites were grouped into three categories based on existing condition. Invaded sites had never been restored or managed ("Control", n=5); had been undergoing restoration for 3-21years ("Managed-int", n=12) but were not yet near the management goal; or were restored plots (11-21years of management) that land managers identified as representative of their restoration target based upon the vegetation present ("Managed-REF", n=5). Each site was a one-ha plot containing four pitfall traps used to assess activity-densities of 35 taxa of epigeic arthropods. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and subsequent canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) revealed that arthropod community structure varied between Control and Managed-REF sites, with the Managed-int sites demonstrating convergence toward the Managed-REF. The activity-densities of non-native isopods (detritivores) were nearly twice as high in Control sites compared to Managed-REF sites, whereas traps in Managed-REF sites had four times the number of Collembola (fungivores). Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) revealed that invasive woody plant cover and rates of uptake of soil P and NO3- by root simulators explained over 40% of the variation in arthropod community structure. Our findings suggest that restoration management targeted at the vegetation also restores the arthropod community in woodlands to a composition that has fewer non-native arthropods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) is an important component of conservation strategies for large marine vertebrates. Thus, quantitative evaluations are necessary to assess whether their habitats are protected by these areas. In this study, the representativeness of government-established MPAs and identified priority areas for conservation (PACs) relative to the Brazilian wintering habitat of humpback whales was assessed using satellite telemetry data (. n=. 74 individuals). Argos-derived location data were filtered and modeled using a switching state space model (SSSM) and overlaid on shapefiles for MPAs and PACs. Humpback whales occurred in only 18.31% of the 71 MPAs observed within the species range. A lower frequency of locations was recorder inside rather than outside these areas. MPAs of Integral Protection used by humpback whales correspond to only 0.64% of the species wintering habitat. In contrast, a total of 40% of the 55 PACs observed within the same area was occupied by the whales, with a higher frequency of locations documented inside the PACs. Our results suggest that PACs encompass the species habitat in a more representative manner than MPAs. Because the former do not provide legal protection, they do not effectively contribute to the species conservation. We suggest PACs used by the species, especially Abrolhos Bank PAC, can be used as basis to refine conservation efforts of humpback whales in their breeding grounds in light of increased anthropogenic stressors. We also demonstrate that animal movement data obtained from satellite telemetry studies are useful for assessing the representativeness of MPAs and to improve management of whales. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {"Empty forests" in which humans have driven large vertebrate species to extinction lack myriad direct and indirect species interactions. This may alter key ecosystem processes, including trophic cascades, disturbance regimes, and nutrient cycling. Past research concerning the effects of tropical forest defaunation mainly compared sites with an intact fauna with sites having degraded faunal communities. However, experimental studies on seedling demographics at individual sites, with the same abiotic and biotic conditions, over a long period of time are still scarce. In this research we conducted a 7-year experiment within a completely intact and pristine forest in Manu National Park, Peru to elucidate the effects of defaunation on tree seedling demographics and densities. We constructed semipermeable exclosures that prevented access of large terrestrial vertebrates, but allowed free passage of small- and medium-sized species. New tree seedlings taller than 5. cm were tagged and followed. Jolly-Seber mark-recapture models were used to estimate density, survival, and recruitment of seedlings. Seedling density in the exclosures continued to increase significantly after the first year of the study. Only during the first 2. years was seedling survival higher in the exclosures. The numbers of new recruits were consistently higher in exclosures when compared to open control plots throughout the study. In accord with increased density, survival, and recruitment in exclosure plots, we also observed increased understory vegetation cover. Our results suggest that defaunation can have long-term effects on seedling demographics and density, which could ultimately influence the composition and diversity of the canopy tree community. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Decomposition of vertebrate carcasses is an important ecosystem function in forests, and burying beetles and scavenging vertebrates is known to contribute to the provision of this function in forests. However, the relative importance of burying beetles and scavenging vertebrates in the removal of vertebrate carcasses has rarely been explored in terms of the impact of forest loss and degradation. Here, we experimentally placed mouse carcasses on forest floors to investigate burial and removal rates by forest animals during a 7-day period at 31 sites (natural broad-leaved forests and conifer plantations in an urban/agricultural matrix) in central Japan. Ninety-six percent of dead mice disappeared with 7. days of being placed on the forest floor. Rates of carcass disappearance increased with forest area surrounding the study sites. Field observations and camera trapping showed that two species of Nicrophorus burying beetles and six species of scavenging vertebrates contributed to the carcass burial and removal. Burial rates by beetles increased with forest area, while removal rates by vertebrates decreased with forest area. Model comparisons showed that the area of both natural forests and plantations surrounding the study sites influenced burial and removal rates. Therefore, forest loss influenced the disappearance rates of vertebrate carcasses. Different responses to forest loss between burying beetles and scavenging vertebrates could maintain the carcass burying/removing function at a landscape level. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Effective conservation planning requires an understanding of species-habitat relationships across a diverse array of taxa, yet many studies typically focus on conspicuous fauna. Using systematic acoustic surveys, we examine the response of insectivorous bat species to urbanization and quantify species-habitat relationships to classify species in terms of their tolerance or sensitivity. Surveys were conducted in Sydney, Australia, during spring-summer of 2008 in 29 defined 25km 2 landscapes, across various land uses. We quantified bat-habitat relationships using local and landscape scale variables. We recorded 17 taxa across the urban gradient, with substantial variation in the tolerance and sensitivity of each species. The density of houses, landscape geology, the amount of bushland (ha) exclusively on fertile geologies and moth biomass were the most frequent predictors of individual activity, explaining more than 60% of variation in activity for some species. Importantly, the area of bushland on poorer soils was not a good predictor, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting results of large scale studies which do not account for variations in habitat productivity. Species-specific differences existed, although the majority of the assemblage was considered to be urban-sensitive. Many of these sensitive species were most active in fertile suburban habitats, with an average of 12-28% bushland cover within 5km. Our study demonstrates the necessity to elucidate species-specific habitat relationships, and suggests bats would benefit from the conservation of productive suburban bushland remnants and riparian habitats, while improving connectivity to these areas via the maintenance of tree cover across the matrix. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of selecting umbrella species or groups of species to protect other groups is a key and unresolved issue in conservation planning. We detected areas important to the four groups of terrestrial vertebrates inhabiting Andalusia (southern Spain) according to four conservation-value criteria, i.e., richness, rarity, vulnerability, and endemicity. We calculated coincidences between criteria and taxa by the degree of correlation and fuzzy overlap between the different criteria for the same group (intra-group coincidence) and between the different groups of species for the same criteria (inter-group coincidence). For the groups to be appropriate umbrella species, inter-group coincidence should be high. The results showed that intra-group coincidence was high, but inter-group coincidence was low. Thus, zones of importance to each group of species tended to be located in different places compared to the other groups, and therefore none of them should be used as an indicator or umbrella group to protect the others. This result has implications for conservation policy, as the Andalusian authorities should not assume that protecting a site important to one group of species will also be relevant to conserve the other groups. Nevertheless, we identified the areas of relatively high conjoint importance for all the groups, and the best umbrella group in this region, which proved to be reptiles. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The knowledge of biodiversity within an area is vital if we want to develop adequate conservation strategies. Biosphere Reserves are purposefully established for the sustainable use of their resources, and therefore their biodiversity should be well known. We compared and evaluated information available for Mexican Biosphere Reserves on threatened and non-threatened vertebrate species records from three different sources - the corresponding Biosphere Reserves management plans (MPs), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility index (GBIF), and scientific literature, in order to find potential knowledge gaps. Our results suggest that there were varying gaps in information among sources according to vertebrate group. For each group of vertebrate species, management plans held the largest subsets of information but were not complete, ranging from 89.6% of the combined known species of birds to 70% for amphibians and freshwater fishes. However, both GBIF and literature included data absent from MPs, and GBIF included data not otherwise available, proving it as important as literature or other data sources (e.g. field data) used for crafting such plans. Moreover, we found references to threatened species that were not listed in the MPs, reaching to as many as 50% of the total known species of fish. Species information shared by all three sources ranged from 28% for amphibians to 72.5% for birds. Conservation efforts should therefore take into account that possibly less charismatic taxa such as amphibians, reptiles and freshwater fish lack more information than birds or mammals. The disparity observed in the vertebrate species information constitutes an information gap that could (or should) be solved by scientists and managers alike. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity loss is unevenly distributed in space and time. Species have reached critically low population sizes in some areas, and remain abundant in others. Similarly, some species may benefit from successful conservation plans, while others still experience severe population depletions driven by negative impacts of human activities. Although several indicators have been proposed to measure the fate of biodiversity, they are generally only implemented globally so their relevance for regional assessment is still unclear. Here, we calculated the first regional trend in the Living Planet Index for the Mediterranean wetlands (Med LPI), an indicator that summarizes the fate of global biological diversity based on the temporal trends in abundance of vertebrate populations. The Med LPI was based on 1641 vertebrate populations of 311 species recorded in Mediterranean wetlands from 1970-2008, in 27 different countries. We investigated whether trends in the Med LPI differed between eastern and western Mediterranean countries, which have different socio-economic contexts. Finally, we assessed whether and how the trend in the Med LPI was robust to changes in the number and identity of species considered. We found that, at the Mediterranean scale, the Med LPI increased steeply, which could be taken at first sight, as a general recovery of wetland biodiversity in this biogeographical region. However, we found highly contrasting spatial trends within the Mediterranean region: the average trend was positive for western and negative for eastern countries. Moreover, we showed that depending on the method used to estimate the trend in Med LPI, it can be sensitive to the number and identity of the species considered. We suggest that understanding the regional discrepancies of the trend in biodiversity indicators as well as their robustness to the species represented in the index will enhance progress assessment towards global and regional conservation strategies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},
