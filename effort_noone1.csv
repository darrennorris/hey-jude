WE STUDIED THE IMPACT OF SHEEP AND GOAT GRAZING ON 50 ASSEMBLAGES OF GROUND SPIDERS (ARANEAE: GNAPHOSIDAE) IN PHRYGANIC, MAQUIS AND FOREST HABITATS FROM ZERO TO 2000 M ELEVATION ON CRETE, GREECE USING PITFALL TRAPS FOR ONE YEAR AT EACH SAMPLING SITE. IN TOTAL, 58 GNAPHOSID SPECIES AND 16,592 INDIVIDUALS WERE COLLECTED. CRETAN ENDEMIC GNAPHOSIDAE WERE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY INTENSIVE GRAZING AND, CONTRARY TO FINDINGS ON OTHER TAXA STUDIED ON THE ISLAND, THEY WERE SPARSE AND RARE THROUGHOUT THE STUDY AREA. THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF GNAPHOSID ASSEMBLAGES WAS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY ELEVATION. TRACHYZELOTES LYONNETI, UROZELOTES RUSTICUS, ZELOTES SCRUTATUS, ANAGRAPHIS PALLENS AND BERINDA AMABILIS PROVED TO BE SIGNIFICANT INDICATORS OF OVERGRAZING. THE VAST MAJORITY OF SPIDERS BELONGING TO SYNANTHROPIC AND NATIONALLY RED-LISTED SPECIES WERE FOUND IN OVERGRAZED SITES. DESPITE THEORETICAL EXPECTATIONS, WHILE THE AVERAGE ACTIVITY DENSITY DECREASED, THE NUMBER OF SPECIES, EVENNESS, RARITY, TAXONOMIC, TEMPORAL AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY (FRIC) INDICES INCREASED WITH INCREASING GRAZING INTENSITY. THIS WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE NATURE OF DISTURBANCE ITSELF, WHICH PROBABLY ALLOWS EQUIBALANCED LOW ABUNDANCES OF INDIGENOUS OR SYNANTHROPIC SPECIES, RATHER THAN OVERDOMINANCE OF FEW, THUS PARTLY REFUTING THE OPPORTUNISTIC SPECIES HYPOTHESIS (OSH). GROUND SPIDER ASSEMBLAGES IN OVERGRAZED SITES COMPRISED SPARSE POPULATIONS OF MOSTLY RARE, OPPORTUNISTIC SPECIES WITH DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS THAT PARTLY REPLACE OTHER SPECIES MORE COMMONLY FOUND IN THE LESS DEGRADED SITES. SPECIES OF THESE ASSEMBLAGES SHORTEN THEIR PHENOLOGIES TO MINIMIZE TEMPORAL CO-OCCURRENCE WITH EACH OTHER DUE TO RESOURCE LIMITATION. THESE DISTINCT COMMUNITY PATTERNS HIGHLIGHT GROUND SPIDERS AS GOOD INDICATORS OF GRAZING PRESSURE ON CRETE, ON SPECIES AND ASSEMBLAGE LEVEL. TO CONSERVE THE INDIGENOUS AND POTENTIALLY ENDANGERED INVERTEBRATE FAUNA, THE SPATIOTEMPORAL DISCONTINUITY OF GRAZING INCLUDING RESTED PATCHES IS IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN SPATIAL VARIABILITY AND POSSIBLY LEAD TO HABITAT RESTORATION."

FOR NOCTURNAL OR CRYPTIC SPECIES, QUANTIFYING HABITAT USE ACROSS INDIVIDUALLY MARKED ANIMALS CAN ALLOW UNBIASED ASSESSMENT OF INTERVENTION EFFICACY AND IDENTIFY OTHER IMPORTANT HABITATS. HERE, USING A LANDSCAPE-SCALE EXPERIMENT, WE EXAMINE WHETHER INTERVENTIONS INTENDED TO CREATE NESTING HABITAT FOR THE LARGELY NOCTURNAL EURASIAN STONE-CURLEW BURHINUS OEDICNEMUS WITHIN SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND ALSO PROVIDE FORAGING HABITAT. GPS LOGGERS WERE FITTED TO FIVE ADULT STONE-CURLEWS DURING THE BREEDING SEASON WITHIN AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND (3850 HA, HEREAFTER `GRASSLAND'), SURROUNDED BY A MOSAIC OF ARABLE CROPLAND (TOTAL STUDY AREA 118 600 HA). THE LARGELY CLOSED-SWARD GRASSLAND WAS DIVERSIFIED BY EXPERIMENTAL GROUND-DISTURBANCE PLOTS (THE INTERVENTION) PRIOR TO THIS STUDY. WE USED THE GPS FIXES TO IDENTIFY 1881 FORAGING LOCATIONS (510 DURING NESTING AND 1371 POST-BREEDING) ACROSS THE GRASSLAND AND SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. MOST FORAGING LOCATIONS WERE CLOSE TO THE NEST-SITE DURING THE NESTING PERIOD (90\% WITHIN 1 KM) OR DAY-ROOST DURING POST-BREEDING (90\% WITHIN 5 KM), BUT BIRDS TRAVELLED UP TO 4.1 KM FROM THESE SITES DURING NESTING AND 13 KM POST-BREEDING. STONE-CURLEWS WERE TWO- (BY NIGHT) OR THREE-TIMES (BY DAY) MORE LIKELY TO SELECT DISTURBED-GRASSLAND OVER UNMODIFIED GRASSLAND FOR FORAGING DURING NESTING, AND C. 15 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DO SO POST-BREEDING. SPRING-SOWN CROPS AND PIG FIELDS OR MANURE HEAPS WERE ALSO SELECTED OVER GRASSLAND FOR NOCTURNAL FORAGING. GIVEN THAT CENTRAL PLACE FORAGING OCCURS IN THIS SPECIES, CONSERVATION EFFORTS THAT PROMOTE BREEDING ATTEMPTS THROUGH GROUND-DISTURBANCE SHOULD ENSURE SUITABLE FORAGING HABITAT IS NEAR THE NEST (<1 KM). CREATING MULTIPLE AREAS OF DISTURBED-GROUND CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF LARGE GRASSLAND BLOCKS CAN PROVIDE A NETWORK OF NESTING AND FORAGING HABITATS, WHILE ALLOWING ACCESS TO FORAGING HABITATS ON THE SURROUNDING ARABLE FARMLAND. SIMILAR INTERVENTIONS MAY BENEFIT OTHER DISTURBANCE ASSOCIATED GRASSLAND WADERS."

NEVERTHELESS, VARYING PROPORTIONS OF ADULTS SURVIVE FIRE; THESE SURVIVING INDIVIDUALS CAN PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE FOR POPULATION RECOVERY. THE REGIONS DEVASTATED BY FIRE OFTEN INCLUDE IMPORTANT HABITAT OF HERMANN'S TORTOISES (TESTUDO HERMANNI HERMANNI), SO ASSESSING THE ABILITY OF SURVIVORS TO PERSIST IS ESSENTIAL FOR CONSERVING THE SPECIES. BODY-CONDITION INDICES PROVIDE AN INTEGRATIVE ESTIMATE OF HOW WELL INDIVIDUALS COPE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATIONS AND IMPACTS, INCLUDING FIRES. BETWEEN 2002 AND 2009, WE MONITORED HERMANN'S TORTOISES IN INTACT AND BURNT HABITATS IN SOUTHEASTERN FRANCE. IN SUMMER 2003, A STRONG FIRE RAVAGED HALF OF THE SURVEYED ZONE, PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPARE BODY CONDITION OF TORTOISES BETWEEN INTACT AND BURNT AREAS OVER TIME. SIX YEARS LATER, THE IMPACT OF FIRE ON VEGETATION WAS STILL MARKED; LARGE TREES WERE ABUNDANT IN THE INTACT AREA, WHEREAS OPEN SHRUB VEGETATION PREVAILED IN THE BURNT AREA. IN BOTH AREAS, THE MEAN BODY CONDITION OF TORTOISES FLUCTUATED OVER TIME; HOWEVER, THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO AREAS. A RADIO-TRACKING EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATED THAT INDIVIDUALS FROM EACH AREA WERE RESIDENTS, AND NOT VAGRANTS COMMUTING BETWEEN AREAS. WE ALSO ASSESSED CHANGES IN BODY CONDITION AND MICROHABITAT USE IN RADIO-TRACKED INDIVIDUALS. WE FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TORTOISES LIVING IN THE BURNT AND INTACT AREAS, DESPITE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN HABITAT USE. IN CONCLUSION: (I) SURVIVING TORTOISES IN AN AREA RAVAGED BY FIRE CAN MAINTAIN THEIR BODY CONDITION LIKE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN AN INTACT AREA, AND THUS, INDIVIDUALS FROM BURNT AREAS SHOULD NOT BE TRANSLOCATED TO SUPPOSEDLY BETTER AREAS; AND (II) DEPOPULATED BURNT AREAS ARE LIKELY TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR POPULATION-AUGMENTATION PROGRAMMES."

AUSTRALIS GROWTH, NUTRITION AND HERBIVORE-DEFENSE TRAITS AND WHETHER MONOPLOID GENOME SIZE AND PLOIDY LEVEL PLAY DIFFERENT ROLES IN PLANT TRAIT EXPRESSION. WE FOUND THAT BOTH MONOPLOID GENOME SIZE AND LATITUDE OF ORIGIN CONTRIBUTED TO VARIATION IN TRAITS THAT WE STUDIED FOR P.

WE ALSO FOUND THAT FOR FOUR TRAITS, TETRAPLOIDS AND OCTOPLOIDS HAD DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MONOPLOID GENOME SIZE. WHILE FOR TETRAPLOIDS STEM HEIGHT AND LEAF WATER CONTENT SHOWED A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH MONOPLOID GENOME SIZE, OCTOPLOIDS HAD A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH MONOPLOID GENOME SIZE FOR STEM HEIGHT AND NO RELATIONSHIP FOR LEAF WATER CONTENT. AS GENOME SIZE WITHIN OCTOPLOIDS INCREASED, THE NUMBER OF APHIDS COLONIZING LEAVES DECREASED, WHEREAS FOR TETRAPLOIDS THERE WAS A QUADRATIC, THOUGH NON-SIGNIFICANT, RELATIONSHIP. GENERALLY WE FOUND THAT TETRAPLOIDS WERE TALLER, CHEMICALLY BETTER DEFENDED, HAD A GREATER NUMBER OF STEMS, HIGHER LEAF WATER CONTENT, AND SUPPORTED MORE APHIDS THAN OCTOPLOIDS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST TRADE-OFFS AMONG PLANT TRAITS MEDIATED BY GENOME SIZE AND PLOIDY WITH RESPECT TO FITNESS AND DEFENSE.

WE EXAMINED SPATIAL SYNCHRONY IN 50 WATERBIRD SPECIES USING AERIAL SURVEY DATA OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES (1983-2016), ACROSS TWO OF AUSTRALIA'S LARGEST RIVER BASINS, REPRESENTING ALMOST A THIRD OF THE CONTINENT USING STATE-SPACE MODELS. THERE WAS BROAD SYNCHRONY IN THE RESPONSES OF AUSTRALIAN WATERBIRD NUMBERS IN WETLANDS, VARYING AMONG FUNCTIONAL RESPONSE GROUPS, REFLECTING THE SPATIOTEMPORAL MOSAIC OF FLOODED WETLANDS ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES. DUCKS, THE MOST ABUNDANT FUNCTIONAL RESPONSE GROUP, AND HERBIVOROUS WATERBIRDS DISPLAYED STRONG SPATIOTEMPORAL SYNCHRONY WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE LAKE EYRE BASIN AND MURRAY-DARLING BASIN, WHILE SYNCHRONY OF PISCIVORES WAS PATCHIER. IN CONTRAST, LARGE WADERS AND PARTICULARLY SHOREBIRDS HAD POOR SYNCHRONICITY. WHILE RAINFALL AMONG CATCHMENTS WITHIN RIVER BASINS WAS HIGHLY CORRELATED, STREAMFLOW WAS CORRESPONDINGLY WEAKLY CORRELATED IN THE MURRAY-DARLING BASIN PRIMARILY BECAUSE RIVER REGULATION HAD SEPARATED RAINFALL FROM FLOW AND INUNDATION, POTENTIALLY COMPROMISING WATERBIRD RESPONSE TRIGGERS. THERE ARE CLEAR CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS FOR WETLANDS AND THEIR WATERBIRD POPULATIONS, PRINCIPALLY THE PROTECTION OF NATURAL FLOW REGIMES IN THE LAKE EYRE BASIN AND WHERE NEEDED, RESTORATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS IN THE MURRAY-DARLING BASIN. ALSO, MANAGEMENT OF WATERBIRDS NEEDS TO OFTEN EXTEND BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF BASINS."

ONE OF THE BEST STUDIED TAXONOMIC GROUPS IN DECLINE IS THE BUTTERFLIES. HERE, WE REVIEW EVIDENCE FOR SUCH DECLINES USING FIVE SYSTEMATIC STUDIES FROM SOUTHERN SWEDEN THAT COMPARE OLD BUTTERFLY SURVEYS WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION. ADDITIONALLY, WE PROVIDE DATA ON BUTTERFLY AND BURNET MOTH EXTINCTIONS IN THE REGION'S COUNTIES. IN SOME LOCAL AREAS, HALF OF THE BUTTERFLY FAUNA HAS BEEN LOST DURING THE LAST 60-100 YEARS. IN TERMS OF EXTINCTIONS, COUNTIES HAVE LOST 2-10 BUTTERFLY AND BURNET MOTH SPECIES. LAND USE HAS CHANGED MARKEDLY WITH KEY BUTTERFLY HABITATS SUCH AS HAY MEADOWS DISAPPEARING AT ALARMING RATES. GRAZED, MIXED OPEN WOODLANDS HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO DENSE CONIFEROUS FORESTS AND CLEAR-CUTS, AND DOMESTIC GRAZERS HAVE BEEN RELOCATED FROM WOODLANDS TO ARABLE FIELDS AND SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS. LEY HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY AND IS USED FOR BALE SILAGE REPEATEDLY DURING THE SEASON. OVERALL, THE CHANGED AND INTENSIFIED LAND USE HAS MARKEDLY REDUCED THE AVAILABILITY OF NECTAR RESOURCES IN THE LANDSCAPE. SPECIES THAT DECLINE IN SWEDEN ARE STRONGLY DECREASING OR ALREADY EXTINCT IN OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE. MANY TYPICAL GRASSLAND SPECIES THAT WERE NUMEROUS IN FORMER TIMES HAVE DECLINED SEVERELY; AMONG THOSE HESPERIA COMMA, LYCAENA VIRGAUREAE, LYCAENA HIPPOTHOE, ARGYNNIS ADIPPE, AND POLYOMMATUS SEMIARGUS. ALSO, SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH OPEN WOODLANDS AND WETLANDS SUCH AS, COLIAS PALAENO, BOLORIA EUPHROSYNE AND THE GLADE-INHABITING LEPTIDEA SINAPIS HAVE ALL DECREASED MARKEDLY. CURRENT MANAGEMENT PRACTISE AND EU COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY RULES FAVOUR INTENSIVE GRAZING ON THE REMAINING SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS, WITH STRONG NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON BUTTERFLY DIVERSITY. ABANDONED GRASSLANDS ARE VERY COMMON IN LESS PRODUCTIVE AREAS OF SOUTHERN SWEDEN AND THESE HABITATS MAY SOON BECOME FORESTS. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION TO PRESERVE UNFERTILIZED, MOWN AND LIGHTLY GRAZED GRASSLANDS. IT IS ALSO CRUCIAL TO ENCOURAGE THAT MANAGEMENT OF ABANDONED GRASSLANDS RESUMES BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.

WE FOUND THAT, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR VARIATION IN BREEDING DISTRIBUTION, SLOW LIFE HISTORY INCREASES THE EXTINCTION RISK IN HABITAT SPECIALIST SPECIES, BUT REDUCES SUCH RISK IN HABITAT GENERALISTS. THE HIGHER THREAT OF HABITAT SPECIALISTS IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR HIGHER SENSITIVITY TO HUMAN-INDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL PERTURBATIONS, MOST NOTABLY TO THE HABITAT LOSS. HOWEVER, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF HABITAT SPECIALIZATION APPEAR TO BE SOMEWHAT COMPENSATED FOR BY FAST LIFE HISTORY. FOR EXAMPLE, SPECIES WITH FAST LIFE HISTORIES TYPICALLY DISPLAY HIGHER FECUNDITY THAN SPECIES WITH SLOW LIFE HISTORIES. AT THE SAME TIME, SLOW LIFE HISTORY CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR HABITAT GENERALISTS THAT ARE NOT AS BADLY AFFECTED BY HABITAT DESTRUCTION AS HABITAT SPECIALISTS. SUCH SPECIES ARE ABLE TO ALLOCATE MORE ENERGY TO FUTURE REPRODUCTION AND COULD WAIT FOR OPTIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BEFORE BREEDING, LEADING TO MORE FAVOURABLE POPULATION STATUS IN THE LONG TERM. FINALLY, WE ALSO FOUND THAT SPECIES BREEDING IN WARMER AREAS EXPERIENCE HIGHER EXTINCTION RISK THAN SPECIES BREEDING IN COLDER AREAS. ALTHOUGH THE EFFECT OF CLIMATIC NICHE IS USUALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WE SUGGEST THAT THE HABITAT DESTRUCTION IS MORE LIKELY AN EXPLANATION BECAUSE THE WARMER LOWLAND REGIONS ARE HEAVILY EXPLOITED BY INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIAL AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. BASED UPON THESE RESULTS, WE SUGGEST THAT CURRENT CONSERVATION EFFORT, ESPECIALLY IN WARMER ZONES, MAY NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HABITAT SPECIALISTS WITH SLOW HISTORIES."

THE MACRO-BENTHIC FAUNA WAS SAMPLED AT 332 SITES WITHIN THE RESERVOIRS FOR THE BIO-INDICATOR ANALYSES. AMONG THE ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS OF WATER QUALITY CITED BY THE INTERVIEWEES, THE MOST NOTABLE WERE WATER COLOR AND ODOR. WHEN THE RISK INCIDENCE INDEX WAS HIGH, THE BIODIVERSITY INDEX WAS FOUND TO BE LOW. LARGER PROPORTIONS OF OLIGOCHAETE OCCURRED IN RESERVOIRS WITH LOW BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, INDICATING THAT LOCAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE REFLECTED RESERVOIR WATER QUALITY. OUR STUDIES SHOWED THAT LOCAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE OF WATER QUALITY INDICATORS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH TRADITIONAL INDICATORS SUCH AS THE MACROBENTHIC FAUNA, CAN BE USED FOR BIOCULTURAL CONSERVATION PURPOSES."

THE DEHESA IS AN OPEN SAVANNA-LIKE LANDSCAPE WITH MATURE/OLD TREES SCATTERED ON A PASTURE COVER WHERE BOTH LIVING AND DEAD WOOD ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF MACROINVERTEBRATE FAUNA. THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN FIVE PLOTS, WITH DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES AND MANAGEMENT. A TOTAL OF 137 BRANCHES BELONGING TO THE FOUR MAIN TREE SPECIES PRESENT IN THE AREA WERE COLLECTED, CLASSIFIED, AND KEPT UNDER FOUR DIFFERENT THERMAL CONDITIONS. FROM JANUARY TO JUNE 2019, THE ADULT EMERGENCES WERE FOLLOWED. A TOTAL OF 466 SAPROXYLIC SPECIMENS OF 31 SPECIES WERE OBTAINED, 5 OF THEM INCLUDED IN RED LISTS OF PROTECTED FAUNA. TWO BOSTRICHIDAE SPECIES (LICHENOPHANES NUMIDA LESNE AND SCOBICIA PUSTULATA FAB.) AND TWO CERAMBYCIDAE (CHLOROPHORUS RUFICORNIS OLIV.

DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED REGARDING THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE AMONG THE PLOTS AND AMONG THE TREE SPECIES FROM WHICH THE BEETLES EMERGED. SIMPLE REGRESSION ANALYSES REVEALED NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TREE DENSITY/BUPRESTIDAE, LIVESTOCK/BOSTRICHIDAE, AND LAND USE/CERAMBYCIDAE. MULTIVARIANT LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS DID NOT FIND SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS AMONG ENVIRONMENTAL TRAITS AND SAPROXYLIC DIVERSITY. RESULTS CONFIRMED THAT DRY WOOD WAS A MAIN RESOURCE FOR THE MAINTENANCE DEHESAS' BIODIVERSITY BECAUSE IT CONSTITUTES AN ECOLOGICAL NICHE EXPLOITED BY A SIGNIFICANT SET OF SAPROXYLIC BEETLES BELONGING TO THE BOSTRICHIDAE, BUPRESTIDAE, AND CERAMBYCIDAE FAMILIES, IN ADDITION TO OTHER GUILDS OF SPECIES, MAINLY CARABIDAE AND CLERIDAE, WHICH FEED ON THE ABOVE-MENTIONED GROUPS.

WE ASSESSED THE ROLE OF SHRUB ENCROACHMENT FOR BIRD COMMUNITIES BY TESTING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHANGE IN SPECIES OCCURRENCE AND SPECIES HABITAT USING A GENERAL LINEAR MODEL. WE ALSO ESTIMATED SPECIES RICHNESS, COLONIZATION AND EXTINCTION AND USED GENERAL LINEAR MODELS TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF VEGETATION CHANGES ON THESE PARAMETERS. RESULTS MORE THAN HALF OF THE BIRD SPECIES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OCCURRENCE BETWEEN 1998 AND 2008: 32 SPECIES INCREASED AND 29 DECREASED. CHANGE IN SPECIES OCCURRENCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPLAINED BY SPECIES HABITAT. SPECIES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING WERE MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH WOODED SAVANNA, WHEREAS SPECIES SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASING WERE MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH OPEN SAVANNA. SPECIES RICHNESS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, AND THIS DECREASE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPLAINED BY SHRUB COVER INCREASE AT THE PLOT SCALE (FROM 24\% TO 44\% ON AVERAGE). EXTINCTION AT THE PLOT SCALE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY THE LOSS OF GRASS COVER, WHILE COLONIZATION AT THE PLOT SCALE WAS INFLUENCED BY TREE COVER INCREASE. MAIN CONCLUSIONS THIS STUDY REPRESENTS THE FIRST EVIDENCE OF TEMPORAL CHANGES IN BIRD COMMUNITIES OWING TO SHRUB ENCROACHMENT IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. DESPITE ITS SHORT TIME FRAME (10 YEARS), THIS STUDY SHOWS DRAMATIC CHANGES IN BOTH VEGETATION STRUCTURE AND BIRD COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. THIS CONFIRMS THE GENERAL CONCERN FOR SOUTHERN AFRICAN BIRD SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH OPEN SAVANNA IF CURRENT TRENDS CONTINUE."

THIS PAPER USED AN EXPERIMENTAL VIGNETTE SURVEY IN MAINLAND CHINA (N = 1002) TO EXPLORE EMPIRICALLY HOW LEGALIZATION, WILDLIFE FARMING, AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN CONSUMPTIVE ACCEPTABILITY AFFECT DEMAND FOR WILDLIFE PRODUCTS. EACH RESPONDENT READ A VIGNETTE ABOUT THE CONSUMPTION OF A WILDLIFE PRODUCT FROM ONE OF FOUR SPECIES (BEARS, TIGERS, SNAKES, OR TURTLES), FOR ONE OF TWO USES (MEDICINAL OR NON-MEDICINAL), IN ONE OF THREE LEGAL SITUATIONS (PRODUCT IS ILLEGAL, PRODUCT IS LEGAL AND FROM FARMED ANIMAL, OR PRODUCT IS LEGAL AND FROM WILD ANIMAL).

DATA WAS ANALYZED USING LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS THAT INCLUDED INTERACTION EFFECTS AND CONTROLLED FOR AGE, GENDER, EDUCATION, INCOME, AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS SPECIFIC SPECIES, TOWARDS WILDLIFE CONSUMPTION, AND TOWARDS TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE. WILDLIFE PRODUCT BANS DECREASED THE ACCEPTABILITY AND SOCIAL APPROVAL OF WILDLIFE CONSUMPTION AND INCREASED ESTIMATIONS OF LEGAL PUNISHMENTS. THE TYPE OF BAN THAT PRODUCED THESE EFFECTS DEPENDED UPON THE WILDLIFE PRODUCT AND THE MEASUREMENT OF WILDLIFE CONSUMPTION. THE EFFECTS OF WILDLIFE FARMING ON DEMAND FOR WILDLIFE PRODUCTS WERE PARTICULARLY PROMINENT FOR MAMMALS. BEAR FARMING INCREASED THE ACCEPTABILITY AND PERCEIVED SOCIAL APPROVAL OF BEAR BILE; IT ALSO DECREASED PERCEIVED LEGAL SANCTIONS FOR BEAR CONSUMPTION. TIGER FARMING DIMINISHED PERCEIVED LEGAL SANCTIONS FOR TIGER CONSUMPTION AND FARMING TIGERS FOR MEDICINAL USE INCREASED THE ACCEPTABILITY OF TIGER CONSUMPTION.

THUS, OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE HOW WELL THEY WOULD PREDICT THE RICHNESS OF PLANTS, MAMMALS AND BIRDS ACROSS THE XINJIANG UYGUR AUTONOMOUS REGION. WE CALCULATED THE DHIS AND ILST FROM THE MODIS VEGETATION AND TEMPERATURE PRODUCTS FROM 2001 TO 2015. WE FOUND THAT: (1) ILST COULD CAPTURE MORE ADDITIVE INFORMATION COMPARED WITH DHIS IN TERMS OF THE RELATIVELY HIGH VARIANCE EXPLANATION OF SPECIES RICHNESS AND HIGH VARIABLE IMPORTANCE, AND THE COMBINATION OF ILST AND DHIS GAVE BETTER PREDICTIONS THAN SINGLE METRICS FOR SPECIES RICHNESS PATTERNS. (2) PLANTS AND BIRDS WERE MORE SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE THAN VEGETATION PRODUCTIVITY, PROBABLY DUE TO PHYSIOLOGICAL TOLERANCE AND EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES. (3) LSTSTD WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLE AFFECTING SPECIES RICHNESS, EXCEPT ON MAMMALS. HIGH LSTSTD WAS RELATED TO MORE FOOD RESOURCES AND HABITATS, AND LOW LSTSTD REPRESENTED EXTREME ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS. COMBINED VEGETATION PROPERTIES AND TEMPERATURE VARIABILITIES ARE GOOD DETERMINANTS OF SPECIES RICHNESS, AND SHOULD BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED IN FUTURE RESEARCH."

SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE INCREASED WITH MAMMALIAN HERBIVORE STOCKING RATES AND RAINFALL. MOST RECENT RAINFALL BEST PREDICTED SPECIES RICHNESS, BUT ABUNDANCE WAS BEST EXPLAINED BY THE LONG-TERM MEASURE OF RAINFALL (MEAN ANNUAL PRECIPITATION). FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY SHOWED NO PATTERNS WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL OR MANAGEMENT VARIABLES WE MEASURED. MEAN BODY LENGTH AND SIZE VARIATION DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN PROTECTED AREAS AND FARMS, BUT THE SPREAD OF BEETLE SIZES WAS MORE EVEN AS VEGETATION COVER INCREASED AND SOIL CLAY CONTENT DECREASED.

TO DO SO, WE MODELED THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION ON NESTING SUCCESS RATES OF 12 GRASSLAND BIRD SPECIES INHABITING A RANGE OF GRASSLAND PATCHES ACROSS NORTH AMERICA (21,000 NESTS FROM 81 INDIVIDUAL STUDIES). HIGHER AMOUNTS OF PRECIPITATION IN THE PRECEDING YEAR WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER NESTING SUCCESS, BUT WETTER CONDITIONS DURING THE ACTIVE BREEDING SEASON REDUCED NESTING SUCCESS. EXTREMELY COLD OR HOT CONDITIONS DURING THE EARLY BREEDING SEASON WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER RATES OF NESTING SUCCESS. THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION ON NESTING SUCCESS WAS MODERATED BY GRASSLAND PATCH SIZE. THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF PRECIPITATION IN THE PRECEDING YEAR ON NESTING SUCCESS WERE STRONGEST IN RELATIVELY SMALL GRASSLAND PATCHES AND HAD LITTLE EFFECT IN LARGE PATCHES. CONVERSELY, WARM TEMPERATURES REDUCED NESTING SUCCESS IN SMALL GRASSLAND PATCHES BUT INCREASED NESTING SUCCESS IN LARGE PATCHES. MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THESE DIFFERENCES MAY BE PATCH-SIZE-INDUCED VARIATION IN MICROCLIMATES AND PREDATOR ACTIVITY.

WE SAMPLED FOR AMPHIBIAN LARVAE DURING 6 SUMMERS FROM 2013 TO 2020 AND USED MULTI-SPECIES OCCUPANCY MODELS THAT ESTIMATED DETECTION AND OCCUPANCY OF EACH OF 4 AMPHIBIAN SPECIES TO DETERMINE HOW AMPHIBIAN RESPONSES CHANGED OVER TIME, ESPECIALLY IN MITIGATION WETLANDS. OCCUPANCY DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN IMPACTED AND REFERENCE WETLANDS FOR ANY OF THE 4 AMPHIBIAN SPECIES. WESTERN TOADS (ANAXYRUS BOREAS) WERE MOST COMMON (ALTHOUGH BRIEFLY) IN CREATED WETLANDS, AND OCCUPANCY OF COLUMBIA SPOTTED FROGS (RANA LUTEIVENTRIS), WESTERN TIGER SALAMANDERS (AMBYSTOMA MAVORTIUM), AND BOREAL CHORUS FROGS (PSEUDACRIS MACULATA) WAS LOWER IN CREATED WETLANDS THAN IN IMPACTED OR REFERENCE WETLANDS. INDIVIDUAL WETLAND AREA WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH OCCUPANCY FOR ALL 4 SPECIES AND WETLAND VEGETATION COVER WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH BOREAL CHORUS FROG AND COLUMBIA SPOTTED FROG OCCUPANCY; THESE RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS WHEN PLANNING MITIGATION WETLANDS. THE LINK BETWEEN WETLAND AGE AND OCCUPANCY WAS COMPLEX AND INCLUDED THRESHOLD AND QUADRATIC RELATIONSHIPS FOR THREE OF THE FOUR SPECIES, BUT ONLY BOREAL CHORUS FROG OCCUPANCY WAS STILL INCREASING SLOWLY AT THE END OF OUR STUDY. OUR RESULTS INDICATE CREATED WETLANDS DID NOT ATTAIN THE SUITABILITY OF IMPACTED AND NATURAL WETLANDS FOR LOCAL AMPHIBIANS, EVEN SEVERAL YEARS AFTER CONSTRUCTION. THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WETLAND AGE AND SPECIES-SPECIFIC OCCUPANCY ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF LONG-TERM MONITORING IN DESCRIBING POPULATION RESPONSES TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF WETLANDS AS MITIGATION FOR WETLAND LOSS."

THE CORE DISTRIBUTION AREA OF KSR IS LIPING, CONGJIANG AND RONGJIANG COUNTY OF SOUTHEAST, GUIZHOU PROVINCE. PADDY FIELDS, FORESTS, LIVESTOCK AND COTTAGES HAVE FORMED A SPECIAL ARTIFICIAL WETLAND ECOSYSTEM IN LOCAL AREA, AND THE DONG PEOPLE HAVE ALSO FORMED A SET OF TRADITIONAL FARMING SYSTEMS OF KSR FOR VARIETY BREEDING, FIELD MANAGEMENT, AND SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION. HOWEVER, THIS TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED AT MULTIPLE LEVELS BASED ON LANDRACES, SPECIES AND ECOSYSTEMS. METHODS FIELDWORK WAS CONDUCTED IN TEN VILLAGES IN SOUTHEAST GUIZHOU FROM 2019 TO 2021. A TOTAL OF 229 INFORMANTS WERE INTERVIEWED FROM THE VILLAGES. SEMI-STRUCTURED AND KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS WERE ADMINISTERED TO COLLECT ETHNOECOLOGICAL DATA ON THE CHARACTERISTICS AND TRADITIONAL UTILIZATION OF KSR, TRADITIONAL FARMING SYSTEMS AND AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT OF THE DONG PEOPLE. RESULTS (1): A TOTAL OF 57 KSR LANDRACES WERE RECORDED AS USED BY THE DONG PEOPLE IN SOUTHEAST GUIZHOU. WE ANALYZED THE CULTURAL IMPORTANCE INDEX (CII) OF ALL KSRS. KSR WITH HIGH CII OFTEN HAS A PLEASANT TASTE, SPECIAL BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF COLD RESISTANCE, DISEASE AND INSECT RESISTANCE AND HIGH UTILIZATION IN THE TRADITIONAL CULTURE OF DONG PEOPLE. (2) THERE IS A CLEAR DIVISION OF LABOR BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IN THE BREEDING, SEED RETENTION, FIELD MANAGEMENT AND GRAIN STORAGE MANAGEMENT OF DIFFERENT LANDRACES OF KSR IN DONG COMMUNITIES. IN ORDER TO RESIST NATURAL DISASTERS AND INSECT PESTS, THE CULTIVATION OF KSR IS USUALLY MANAGED BY MULTI-VARIETY MIXED PLANTING. THESE AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT MODES ARE THE RESULT OF DONG PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING AND ADAPTATION TO THE LOCAL NATURAL GEOGRAPHICAL ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS THE EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM CRYSTALLIZATION OF DONG PEOPLE'S LONG-TERM PRACTICE. (3) THE TRADITIONAL FARMLAND OF DONG PEOPLE IS A TYPICAL ARTIFICIAL WETLAND ECOSYSTEM THAT IS PLANTED WITH MIXED KSR LANDRACES WITH RICH TRADITIONAL WISDOM. IN ADDITION, THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF THE RICE-FISH-DUCK SYMBIOTIC SYSTEM WAS 3.07 TIMES THAT OF HYBRID RICE ALONE; THEREFORE, THE RICE-FISH-DUCK SYSTEM NOT ONLY HAS THE FUNCTION OF MAINTAINING SOIL, WATER AND ECOLOGICAL BALANCE BUT ALSO IMPROVES THE INCOME OF DONG PEOPLE. CONCLUSION KSR IS A SPECIAL KIND OF RICE THAT HAS BEEN DOMESTICATED AND CULTIVATED BY DONG PEOPLE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. DONG PEOPLE HAVE ALSO FORMED TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURE DOMINATED BY KSR CULTIVATION. THE TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT OF DONG PEOPLE PROVIDES SUITABLE HABITATS FOR FLORA AND FAUNA WITH BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION, AND CONVENIENT CONDITIONS FOR RATIONAL UTILIZATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF WATER RESOURCES WERE ALSO PROVIDED. THIS TRADITIONAL MANAGEMENT MODE IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, CLIMATE CHANGE RESPONSE, COMMUNITY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, SUSTAINABLE UTILIZATION AND AGRICULTURAL TRANSFORMATION IN MODERN SOCIETY. THEREFORE, WE CALL FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, IN-DEPTH STUDY OF THE ECOLOGICAL CULTURE OF ETHNIC AREAS, AND SORT OUT TREASURES CONDUCIVE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL MANKIND."

OUR RESULTS INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE-DECAY EFFECT FOR MULTIFACETED BETA-DIVERSITY OF AMPHIBIANS ON MOUNT EMEI AND FOUND THAT EFFECTS AND DIRECTIONS OF PREDICTORS ON MULTIFACETED BETA-DIVERSITY WERE DIFFERENT, WITH TEMPERATURE SEASONALITY, ANNUAL PRECIPITATION, AND ELEVATIONAL DISTANCE ACTING AS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS. COMPARING OBSERVED PATTERNS WITH NULL-MODEL EXPECTATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERING, AND COMPETITIVE EXCLUSION MAY JOINTLY DRIVE ELEVATIONAL PATTERNS OF BETA-DIVERSITY. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: OUR STUDY EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTITIONING TAXONOMIC, PHYLOGENETIC, AND FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS OF BETA-DIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY WHEN DETERMINING BETA-DIVERSITY DRIVERS. ALTHOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH RANDOM COMMUNITIES FROM OUTCOMES OF NICHE-BASED PROCESSES, THIS WORK HIGHLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL ROLES OF ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERING AND COMPETITIVE EXCLUSION IN CONTROLLING ELEVATIONAL COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO AMPHIBIAN COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY IN A BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT."

ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN A RISE OF ETHNOBIOLOGICAL STUDIES OVER THE LAST DECADE, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HUMAN INTERACTION WITH HERPETOFAUNA IN SOUTH AMERICA AND COLOMBIA. IN THIS WORK, WE ANALYZED THE KNOWLEDGE, PERCEPTION, AND INTERACTION OF A LOCAL COMMUNITY LOCATED IN THE FOREST RESERVE OF QUININI (RFPCQ) IN CUNDINAMARCA (COLOMBIA), CONCERNING TO THE HERPETOFAUNA THAT INHABITS THE AREA. METHODS WE PERFORMED SEMI-STRUCTURED SURVEYS CONTAINING 30 QUESTIONS CATEGORIZED INTO THREE GROUPS: ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE (1), USE AND CULTURAL BELIEFS (2), AND INTERACTIONS (3) RELATED TO THE HERPETOFAUNA THAT OCCURS IN THE REGION. THE OBTAINED DATA IN QUESTION GROUPS 1 AND 2 ARE PRESENTED AS A QUALITATIVE SUMMARY. FOR THE QUESTION GROUP 3, WE ASSIGNED THE ANSWERS TO A HOSTILITY VALUE ACCORDING TO THE POSSIBLE REACTION OF EACH INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWED IN A HYPOTHETICAL ENCOUNTER WITH THE HERPETOFAUNA AND BUILT TENDENCY CHARTS IN ORDER TO SEE THE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE REACTIONS DUE TO THE BIRTHPLACE (URBAN/RURAL) AND GENDER (MALE/FEMALE). RESULTS THE COMMUNITY RECOGNIZED THE PRESENCE OF AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES THAT COHABIT THEIR SPACE, AS WELL AS THEIR POTENTIAL HABITATS. BESIDES, THE ROLE OF HERPETOFAUNA WAS RECOGNIZED IN THE MAGICAL/RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS FOR SOME INHABITANTS OF THE REGION, MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FATE AND CURE OF CHRONIC DISEASES. IN GENERAL, THE PERCEPTION OF AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES VARIED ACCORDING TO THE ORIGIN AND GENDER OF THE PEOPLE, WHICH TEND TO HAVE A MORE POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF REPTILES THAN COMPARED TO AMPHIBIANS IN MOST CASES. CONCLUSIONS ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A GENERAL LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ON THE PART OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE RFPCQ ABOUT THE BIOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF HERPETOFAUNA, THE POPULATION RECOGNIZED THE BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE HABITATS OF THESE ANIMALS WITHIN THE RESERVE AREA. THERE IS A WIDE VARIETY OF USES OF AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES IN TRADITIONAL MEDICINE. GREATER EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE IN THE TRANSMISSION AND DISSEMINATION OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF HERPETOFAUNA."
