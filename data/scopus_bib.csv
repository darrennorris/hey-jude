THIS STUDY MODELLED THE SPATIAL EFFECTS OF ORGANIC FARMING (INTENSITY OF LOCAL FARMING SYSTEMS), ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY, AND URBANISATION ON TWO WIDELY STUDIED ENVIRONMENTAL TAXA — VASCULAR PLANT AND BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS (SURROGATE MEASURES OF BIODIVERSITY) — IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA, USING A UNIQUE CERTIFIED ORGANIC FARMING POSTCODE LEVEL DATASET FROM 2001 TO 2016 (N = 5440). THE SPATIAL DURBIN ERROR MODEL RESULTS CONFIRMED THE POSITIVE SPATIAL CONGRUENCE OF ORGANIC FARMING WITH GREATER VASCULAR PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS, WHEREAS ONLY WEAK TO NO SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS. LANDSCAPE FEATURES (HABITAT HETEROGENEITY) AND GREEN VEGETATION (A PROXY INDICATOR OF RESOURCE AVAILABILITY) – RATHER THAN ORGANIC FARMING – APPEARED TO BE MOST ASSOCIATED WITH BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS. BOTH PLANT AND BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH HABITAT HETEROGENEITY (LAND COVER DIVERSITY AND ELEVATION RANGE), PLANT PRODUCTIVITY AND PROPORTION OF CONSERVATION LAND AND WATER BODIES. WHEREAS, INCREASED ANTHROPOGENIC LAND USE FOR CROPPING AND HORTICULTURAL FARMING, SOIL TYPE DIVERSITY AND PROXIMITY TO THE COAST SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SPECIES RICHNESS OF BOTH TAXA.

HOWEVER, CAPTIVE-REARED ANIMALS ARE OFTEN RAISED IN CONDITIONS DISSIMILAR TO THEIR RELEASE SITES AND LACKING NATURAL CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH COULD ALTER MOVEMENT PATTERNS AND POSTRELEASE SURVIVORSHIP. THESE PATTERNS CAN BE FURTHER ALTERED BY SEASON OF RELEASE AND SOFT-RELEASE CONDITIONS. WE REARED JUVENILE EASTERN HELLBENDERS (CRYPTOBRANCHUS ALLEGANIENSIS ALLEGANIENSIS) FOR 18 MO IN CAPTIVITY IN ONE OF TWO CONDITIONS: A CONTROL CONDITION WITH LOW-VELOCITY WATER FLOW (UNCONDITIONED) OR A TREATMENT CONDITION WITH MOVING WATER (CONDITIONED) THAT SIMULATED NATURAL FLOW VELOCITIES AT THEIR INTENDED RELEASE SITE. WE DIVIDED 4-YR-OLD HELLBENDERS (N = 118) INTO SIX TREATMENT GROUPS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF RELEASE SEASON (FALL OR SUMMER), RELEASE TYPE (STANDARD SOFT RELEASE OR ENHANCED SOFT RELEASE), AND CONDITIONING (UNCONDITIONED OR CONDITIONED) ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS UNTIL FIRST MOVEMENT, RELEASE SITE RETENTION, AND SURVIVAL. IN NOVEMBER 2017, WE RELEASED 80 RADIO-TAGGED INDIVIDUALS (40 CONDITIONED AND 40 UNCONDITIONED) INTO SOFT-RELEASE STRUCTURES IN THE BLUE RIVER, INDIANA. IN JULY 2018, WE RELEASED ANOTHER 38 RADIO-TAGGED INDIVIDUALS (18 CONDITIONED AND 20 UNCONDITIONED) INTO SOFT-RELEASE STRUCTURES AT THE SAME SITE. AFTER RELEASE, WE TRACKED EACH INDIVIDUAL ONE TO THREE TIMES WEEKLY FOR 10 MO (FALL RELEASE) OR 12 MO (SUMMER RELEASE). WE FOUND THAT TREATMENT GROUPS RELEASED INTO CAGED COBBLE BEDS (I.E., ENHANCED SOFT RELEASE) DELAYED THEIR FIRST MOVEMENT AND HAD HIGHER RELEASE SITE RETENTION RELATIVE TO GROUPS RELEASED UNDER CAGED SHELTER ROCKS (I.E., STANDARD SOFT RELEASE). WE FOUND THAT CONDITIONING HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON SURVIVAL BUT ONLY IN THE TREATMENT GROUP RELEASED IN THE SUMMER. BY COMBINING TECHNIQUES AND RELEASING CONDITIONED INDIVIDUALS IN THE SUMMER USING ENHANCED SOFT RELEASES, WE INCREASED ANNUAL SURVIVAL OF CAPTIVE-REARED HELLBENDERS FROM A PROBABILITY OF 0.50 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] = 0.31-0.79) TO 0.74 (95% CI = 0.55-0.99).

IN GREATER SAN MIGUEL DE TUCUMÁN (GSMT), PROVINCE OF TUCUMÁN, ARGENTINA, THERE ARE HIGHER LEVELS OF URBANIZATION TO THE EAST AND LOWER LEVELS TO THE WEST, BORDERING THE SIERRA DE SAN JAVIER. ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE BIOLOGY OF BIRDS IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS ARE KNOWN, KNOWLEDGE IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS IS SCARCE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK WAS TO EVALUATE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE NESTING OF THE GREAT KISKADEE IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS AND HOW THEY VARY BETWEEN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF URBANIZATION. THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN THREE SECTORS OF THE GSMT, TWO IN THE CITY OF SAN MIGUEL DE TUCUMÁN AND ONE IN YERBA BUENA, DURING THE REPRODUCTIVE SEASONS (SEPTEMBER-MARCH) OF 2020-2022. A TOTAL OF 46 NESTS WERE FOUND, OF WHICH 27 OF THEM WERE SUCCESSFUL.

HERE, WE ASSESS HOW DIVERSITY INFLUENCES LONG-TERM THERMAL NICHE VARIATION IN COMMUNITIES UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE. WE USE 50-YEAR CONTINENTAL-SCALE DATA ON BIRD COMMUNITIES DURING BREEDING AND NON-BREEDING SEASONS TO QUANTIFY THE COMMUNITIES’ THERMAL VARIABILITY. THERMAL VARIABILITY IS MEASURED AS THE TEMPORAL CHANGE IN THE COMMUNITY’S AVERAGE THERMAL NICHE AND IT INDICATES COMMUNITY’S RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THEN, WE STUDY HOW THE THERMAL VARIABILITY VARIES AS A FUNCTION OF TAXONOMIC, FUNCTIONAL, AND EVOLUTIONARY DIVERSITY USING LINEAR MODELS. WE FIND THAT COMMUNITIES WITH LOW THERMAL NICHE VARIATION HAVE HIGHER FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY, WITH THIS PATTERN BEING MEASURABLE IN THE NON-BREEDING BUT NOT IN THE BREEDING SEASON. GIVEN THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN SEASONAL VARIATION IN THE FUTURE CLIMATE, THE DIFFERENCES IN BIRD COMMUNITIES’ THERMAL VARIABILITY BETWEEN BREEDING AND NON-BREEDING SEASONS MAY GROW WIDER.

PARTICULARLY, THE QMISEQ APPROACH HAS RECENTLY BEEN DEVELOPED AS A QUANTITATIVE METABARCODING METHOD AND HAS ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION DUE TO ITS USEFULNESS. THE AIM HERE WAS TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE QMISEQ APPROACH AS A QUANTITATIVE MONITORING TOOL FOR FISH COMMUNITIES BY COMPARING THE QUANTIFIED EDNA CONCENTRATIONS WITH THE RESULTS OF FISH CAPTURE SURVEYS. THE EDNA WATER SAMPLING AND THE CAPTURE SURVEYS USING THE ELECTRICAL SHOCKER WERE CONDUCTED AT A TOTAL OF 21 SITES IN FOUR RIVERS IN JAPAN. AS A RESULT, WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE EDNA CONCENTRATIONS OF EACH SPECIES QUANTIFIED BY QMISEQ AND BOTH THE ABUNDANCE AND BIOMASS OF EACH CAPTURED TAXON AT EACH SITE. FURTHERMORE, FOR SEVEN OUT OF ELEVEN TAXA, A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN QUANTIFIED DNA CONCENTRATIONS BY SAMPLE AND THE ABUNDANCE AND/OR BIOMASS. IN TOTAL, OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT EDNA METABARCODING WITH THE QMISEQ APPROACH IS A SUITABLE AND USEFUL TOOL FOR QUANTITATIVE MONITORING OF FISH COMMUNITIES. DUE TO THE SIMPLICITY OF THE EDNA ANALYSIS, THE EDNA METABARCODING WITH QMISEQ APPROACH WOULD PROMOTE FURTHER GROWTH OF QUANTITATIVE MONITORING OF BIODIVERSITY. © 2022, THE AUTHOR(S).",21524,"DNA, ENVIRONMENTAL",NA,"TSUJI, S.; GRADUATE SCHOOL OF SCIENCE, KITASHIRAKAWA-OIWAKECHO, SAKYO-KU, JAPAN; EMAIL: SATSUKI.MAY425@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1038/s41598-022-25274-3,"RIVER FOUNDATIONRIVER FOUNDATION, 2019-5211-030 YAMAGUCHI UNIVERSITYYAMAGUCHI UNIVERSITY HONG KONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYHONG KONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, HKUST",20452322,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,1,NA,NATURE RESEARCH,36513686,SCOPUS,QUANTITATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL DNA METABARCODING SHOWS HIGH POTENTIAL AS A NOVEL APPROACH TO QUANTITATIVELY ASSESS FISH COMMUNITY,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144159137&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-022-25274-3&partnerID=40&md5=20198da54e4c97e076d6103f0b01325a,12,2022,"WE THANK LABORATORY MEMBERS OF AKAMATSU LABORATORY, YAMAGUCHI UNIVERSITY, AND INUI LABORATORY, FUKUOKA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY, FOR HELP WITH THE FIELD SAMPLING.

THE ASSESSMENT OF ECOSYSTEMS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION IS ESSENTIAL FOR KNOWING THEIR INTEGRITY AND ABILITY TO PROVIDE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. THE AIM OF THIS INVESTIGATION WAS TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF LEAP/FAO GUIDELINES FOR QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF BIODIVERSITY IN THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR AT THE LOCAL SCALE (FARM LEVEL) IN A GROUP OF SIX STUDY CASES IN URUGUAY. A SET OF 20 INDICATORS WAS USED, INCLUDING SEVEN KEY THEMATIC ISSUES: HABITAT PROTECTION, HABITAT CHANGE, WILDLIFE CONSERVATION, INVASIVE SPECIES, POLLUTION, AQUATIC BIODIVERSITY, OFF-FARM FEED, AND LANDSCAPE-SCALE CONSERVATION. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE LEAP BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES CAN BE USEFUL TO CHARACTERIZE THE STATE OF ECOSYSTEMS UNDER PASTORAL USE AND SOME SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THEIR BIODIVERSITY, AS WELL AS ASSESS THE INTERACTION OF THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM WITH THE ENVIRONMENT AND PLAN MANAGEMENT ACCORDINGLY. THIS WORK ALSO PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF THE METHODOLOGY USED AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO FACILITATE ITS APPLICATION BY THE SECTOR. THE RESULTS FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE INDICATORS SHOW A GREAT DEAL OF WILD BIODIVERSITY THAT USES GRAZING SYSTEMS BASED ON NATIVE GRASSLANDS AS HABITATS AND THE ACCEPTABLE INTEGRITY OF THESE ECOSYSTEMS. ON AVERAGE, FARMS HAVE 83% OF THEIR NATIVE ECOSYSTEM, WITH A VALUE OF 3.5 FOR THE ECOSYSTEM INTEGRITY INDEX. IN TERMS OF THE RICHNESS OF DIFFERENT GROUPS, THERE WAS AN AVERAGE NUMBER OF SPECIES OF 112 HERBACEOUS PLANTS, 48 WOODY PLANTS, 48 SPIDERS, 150 BIRDS, AND 14 FISH. THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO HELP IN THE WIDER APPLICATION OF THE GUIDELINES BY FACILITATING DECISIONS ABOUT METHODOLOGY, NECESSARY RESOURCES, AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT.

ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY ACCEPTED MEASURES TO HALT THE RATE OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS IS TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND PROTECTED AREAS THAT ARE EFFECTIVELY MANAGED. HOWEVER, DOING SO REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL FINANCE DERIVED FROM NATURE-BASED TOURISM, SPECIFICALLY VISITORS FROM URBAN AREAS. USING THE BAYESIAN MINDSPONGE FRAMEWORK (BMF) FOR CONDUCTING ANALYSIS ON 535 VIETNAMESE URBAN RESIDENTS, THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED HOW THEIR BIODIVERSITY LOSS PERCEPTIONS CAN AFFECT THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR THE ENTRANCE FEE AND CONSERVATION IN PROTECTED AREAS. WE FOUND THAT PERCEIVED ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, LOSS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, LOSS OF NATURE-BASED RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES, AND LOSS OF KNOWLEDGE AS CONSEQUENCES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS INDIRECTLY AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS TO PAY THROUGH THE MEDIATION OF THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS CONSERVATION. NOTABLY, PERCEIVED KNOWLEDGE LOSS ALSO HAS A DIRECT POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON THE WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR THE ENTRANCE FEE AND CONSERVATION. IN CONTRAST, PERCEIVED LOSS OF HEALTH IS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS CONSERVATION. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, WE SUGGEST THAT BUILDING AN ECO-SURPLUS CULTURE AMONG URBAN RESIDENTS BY STIMULATING THEIR SUBJECTIVE COST-BENEFIT JUDGMENTS TOWARDS BIODIVERSITY LOSS CAN BE A PROMISING WAY TO GENERATE MORE FINANCE FROM NATURE-BASED TOURISM FOR CONSERVATION IN PROTECTED AREAS AND EASE THE DOMESTIC GOVERNMENT’S AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS’ FUNDING ALLOCATION PROBLEMS.

WHILE HERALDED AS CONSERVATION SUCCESS, ONLY FEW SUCH RECOVERIES HAVE BEEN EXAMINED FROM A GENETIC PERSPECTIVE, I.E. WHETHER GENETIC VARIABILITY AND CONNECTIVITY HAVE BEEN RESTORED. WE HERE USE LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM GENETIC MONITORING DATA FROM UK OTTERS, WHOSE POPULATION UNDERWENT A WELL-DOCUMENTED POPULATION DECLINE BETWEEN THE 1950S AND 1970S, TO EXPLORE THE DYNAMICS OF A POPULATION RE-EXPANSION OVER A 21-YEAR PERIOD. WE GENOTYPED OTTERS FROM ACROSS WALES AND ENGLAND AT FIVE TIME POINTS BETWEEN 1994 AND 2014 USING 15 MICROSATELLITE LOCI. WE USED THIS COMBINATION OF LONG-TERM TEMPORAL AND LARGE-SCALE SPATIAL SAMPLING TO EVALUATE 3 HYPOTHESES RELATING TO GENETIC RECOVERY THAT (I) GENE FLOW BETWEEN SUBPOPULATIONS WOULD INCREASE OVER TIME, (II) GENETIC DIVERSITY OF PREVIOUSLY ISOLATED POPULATIONS WOULD INCREASE AND THAT (III) GENETIC STRUCTURING WOULD WEAKEN OVER TIME. ALTHOUGH WE FOUND AN INCREASE IN INTER-REGIONAL GENE FLOW AND ADMIXTURE LEVELS AMONG SUBPOPULATIONS, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT TEMPORAL CHANGE IN EITHER HETEROZYGOSITY OR ALLELIC RICHNESS. GENETIC STRUCTURING AMONG THE MAIN SUBPOPULATIONS HENCE REMAINED STRONG AND SHOWED A CLEAR HISTORICAL CONTINUITY. THESE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT AN UNDERAPPRECIATED ASPECT OF POPULATION RECOVERY OF ENDANGERED SPECIES: THAT GENETIC RECOVERY MAY OFTEN LAG BEHIND THE PROCESSES OF SPATIAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC RECOVERY. IN OTHER WORDS, THE RESTORATION OF THE PHYSICAL CONNECTIVITY OF POPULATIONS DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO GENETIC CONNECTIVITY.

ONE OF THE MAIN CAUSES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN VIETNAM IS THE UNSUSTAINABLE BUSHMEAT CONSUMPTION RATE IN URBAN AREAS. TO HELP MITIGATE THE DEMAND FOR BUSHMEAT, THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN BIODIVERSITY LOSS PERCEPTIONS, PERCEPTION TOWARD THE PROHIBITION OF ILLEGAL WILDLIFE CONSUMPTION, AND BUSHMEAT CONSUMPTION BEHAVIORS AMONG URBAN RESIDENTS IN VIETNAM. THE INVESTIGATION EMPLOYED THE BAYESIAN MINDSPONGE FRAMEWORK (BMF)—AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK THAT COMBINES THE STRENGTHS OF THE MINDSPONGE MECHANISM AND BAYESIAN INFERENCE TO FACILITATE INVESTIGATION INTO PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ISSUES—ON 535 RESPONDENTS FROM URBAN AREAS ACROSS VIETNAM (MOSTLY IN THE TWO URBAN CENTERS OF HO CHI MINH AND HANOI). WE FOUND THAT PEOPLE PERCEIVING ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, AND LOSSES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, NATURE-BASED RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES, HEALTH, AND KNOWLEDGE AS CONSEQUENCES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS WERE MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT THE PROHIBITION OF ILLEGAL WILDLIFE CONSUMPTION. ALTHOUGH URBAN RESIDENTS TENDED TO CONSUME BUSHMEAT LESS FREQUENTLY IF THEY PERCEIVED LOSSES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND KNOWLEDGE AS CONSEQUENCES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS, THE PERCEPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION HAD AN OPPOSITE EFFECT ON THE BEHAVIOR. ADDITIONALLY, PEOPLE CONSUMING BUSHMEAT FREQUENTLY AND SUPPORTING THE BIODIVERSITY LOSS PREVENTIVE MEASURE SEEMED TO SHARE SIMILAR FEATURES: HIGH INCOME AND EDUCATIONAL LEVELS. THESE PARADOXICAL RESULTS HINT AT THE CULTURAL ADDITIVITY PHENOMENON—THE WILLINGNESS TO INCORPORATE INTO ONE'S MIND THE NEW VALUES THAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT LOGICALLY CONTRADICT THEIR EXISTING CORE CULTURAL VALUES—AND ITS INFLUENCE ON PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR AMONG VIETNAMESE URBAN RESIDENTS. GIVEN THE INFLUENCE OF CULTURAL ADDITIVITY, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO PUT TOUGHER MEASURES (E.G., FINANCIAL PUNISHMENT) INTO PERSPECTIVE SO THAT URBAN PEOPLE CAN RECOGNIZE THE HIGH “COST” OF BUSHMEAT CONSUMPTION AND CHANGE THEIR PERCEPTIONS AND BEHAVIORS ACCORDINGLY. APART FROM THAT, SOCIAL MARKETING, DEMARKETING, OR EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS SHOULD CONVEY KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP RECEIVERS RELATE BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND BUSHMEAT CONSUMPTION TO THEIR SUBJECTIVE COST-BENEFIT JUDGMENTS RATHER THAN THE RARITY OF THE SPECIES TO AVOID TRIGGERING AN ANTHROPOGENIC ALLEE EFFECT—FOR EXAMPLE, EMPHASIZING THE PENALTY FOR CONSUMING BUSHMEAT AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS ON HUMANS IN TARGETED CAMPAIGNS (E.G., LOSSES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND KNOWLEDGE). © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

NAT. CONSERV.,1,"IN HUMAN-DOMINATED AND HIGHLY FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPES, KEEPING WILDLIFE WITHIN RESERVE BOUNDARIES IS VITAL FOR CONSERVATION SUCCESS. IN SOUTH AFRICA, FENCES ARE A WIDELY EMPLOYED CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT TOOL FOR PROTECTED AREAS AND ARE SUCCESSFUL IN MITIGATING HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICT. HOWEVER, FENCES ARE PERMEABLE, AND PREDATORS ARE ABLE TO CROSS THROUGH RESERVE FENCES. AFRICAN WILD DOGS (LYCAON PICTUS) OFTEN LEAVE FENCED BOUNDARIES, RESULTING IN HIGH CAPTURE AND TRANSLOCATION COSTS. MOREOVER, WHEN WILD DOG PACKS (UP TO 30 INDIVIDUALS) LEAVE FENCED RESERVES THEY ENTER HUMAN-DOMINATED LANDSCAPES WHERE THEY FACE STRONG PERSECUTION AND LIVESTOCK PREDATION INCURS HIGH COSTS. THE FACTORS DRIVING PACKS TO LEAVE MANAGED RESERVES ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD, THUS, TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE WILD DOGS IN FENCED SYSTEMS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY LEAVE RESERVE BOUNDARIES. THERE ARE SEVERAL HYPOTHESES AS TO WHY WILD DOGS CROSS THROUGH RESERVE FENCES, INCLUDING INTER- AND INTRA-SPECIFIC COMPETITION, SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR, MANAGEMENT, PREY DENSITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY. USING A LONG-TERM DATASET COMPRISING 32 RESIDENT PACKS ACROSS FIVE RESERVES, WE INVESTIGATED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THESE HYPOTHESES ON THE PROBABILITY OF WILD DOGS EXITING A FENCED RESERVE. DURING THE 14-YEAR STUDY PERIOD, WE RECORDED 154 EXIT EVENTS. WE FOUND THAT THE INTERACTION OF FENCE INTEGRITY AND TIME SINCE PACK FORMATION WERE THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROBABILITY OF A PACK LEAVING A RESERVE. WHEN FENCE INTEGRITY WAS POOR, ESCAPE PROBABILITY DECREASED WITH PACK AGE LIKELY DUE TO THE EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOUR OF NEW PACKS. WHEN FENCE INTEGRITY WAS AVERAGE, ESCAPE PROBABILITY INCREASED WITH PACK AGE LIKELY DUE TO THE FITNESS BENEFITS OF HOLDING LARGER AND MORE EXCLUSIVE TERRITORIES AS PACKS AGE. WHEN FENCE INTEGRITY WAS GOOD, THE PROBABILITY OF A PACK ESCAPING WAS VERY LOW (ONLY 1% OCCURRENCE). THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS RESEARCH SUGGEST THAT THE PRIMARY MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATION FOR REDUCING WILD DOG ESCAPES FROM FENCED RESERVES SHOULD BE MAINTAINING ADEQUATE RESERVE-WIDE FENCE INTEGRITY, RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON SOCIAL STRUCTURE OR DRIVERS OF INTER- AND INTRA-SPECIFIC COMPETITION. © 2022 THE AUTHOR(S)",126291,NA,JNCOA,"STONE, D.W.; SCHOOL OF BIODIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY AVENUE, UNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: DAVID.STONE.2@GLASGOW.AC.UK",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.jnc.2022.126291,"HORIZON 2020 FRAMEWORK PROGRAMMEHORIZON 2020 FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME, H2020 BRITISH ECOLOGICAL SOCIETYBRITISH ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY, BES HORIZON 2020HORIZON 2020, 641918",16171381,JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,ELSEVIER GMBH,NA,SCOPUS,FENCE MANAGEMENT AND TIME SINCE PACK FORMATION INFLUENCE AFRICAN WILD DOG ESCAPES FROM PROTECTED AREAS IN SOUTH AFRICA,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140493247&doi=10.1016%2fj.jnc.2022.126291&partnerID=40&md5=2fe420efb2771b1e8b5c75291b1f55c0,70,2022,"THIS PROJECT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF EZEMVELO KZN WILDLIFE AND THE ISIMANGALISO WETLAND PARK AUTHORITY.

PASTURE AND PLANTATION EXPANSION OFTEN DRIVES DEFORESTATION, WHICH CAUSES HOMOGENIZATION OF BIOTIC COMMUNITIES AND IS A MAJOR DRIVER OF THE GLOBAL EXTINCTION CRISIS. A CORE QUESTION IS HOW THE SEVERITY OF LOSSES VARIES BETWEEN PASTURES AND PLANTATIONS, AND IN TURN, HOW GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND PLANTATION MANAGEMENT CHARACTERISTICS MODERATE THESE IMPACTS. FOCUSING ON HERPETOFAUNA (AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES) AS THE MOST ENDANGERED VERTEBRATE GROUP, WE PERFORMED A GLOBAL SYNTHESIS USING 41 SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES THAT REPORTED SPECIES RICHNESS OR ABUNDANCE IN PASTURES AND FORESTRY PLANTATIONS RELATIVE TO NATURAL FOREST IN 191 CASE STUDIES AMONG 19 COUNTRIES. WE FOUND A SEVERE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF PASTURE AND A LESS NEGATIVE EFFECT OF FORESTRY PLANTATIONS ON SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF HERPETOFAUNA. WITHIN PLANTATIONS, SPECIES RICHNESS AND TOTAL ABUNDANCE WERE MORE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN AMPHIBIANS THAN REPTILES, IN THE TROPICS, WHEN PLANTING EXOTIC TREE SPECIES, MONOCULTURES, LARGE OR COMMERCIAL PLANTATIONS, AND WHEN CLEARING UNDERSTORY VEGETATION.

BETTER MANAGEMENT ACTIONS WITHIN A SPECIES' RANGE CAN BE ACHIEVED BY IDENTIFYING THE LOCATION AND TIMING OF POPULATION CHANGES. IN THE GREATER MAHALE ECOSYSTEM (GME), WESTERN TANZANIA, DEFORESTATION DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF HUMAN SETTLEMENTS AND AGRICULTURE, ANNUAL BURNING, AND LOGGING ARE KNOWN THREATS TO WILDLIFE. FOR ONE OF THE MOST CHARISMATIC SPECIES, THE ENDANGERED EASTERN CHIMPANZEE (PAN TROGLODYTES SCHWEINFURTHII), APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE INDIVIDUALS ARE DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE NATIONAL PARK BOUNDARIES, REQUIRING MONITORING AND PROTECTION EFFORTS OVER A VAST LANDSCAPE OF VARIOUS PROTECTION STATUSES. THESE EFFORTS ARE ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING WHEN WE LACK DATA ON TRENDS IN DENSITY AND POPULATION SIZE. TO PREDICT SPATIO-TEMPORAL CHIMPANZEE DENSITY AND ABUNDANCE ACROSS THE GME, WE USED DENSITY SURFACE MODELING, FITTING A GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODEL TO A 10-YEAR TIME-SERIES DATA SET OF NEST COUNTS BASED ON LINE-TRANSECT SURVEYS. THE CHIMPANZEE POPULATION DECLINED AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 2.41%, INCLUDING DECLINES OF 1.72% IN RIPARIAN FORESTS (FROM THIS POINT FORWARD, FORESTS), 2.05% IN MIOMBO WOODLANDS (FROM THIS POINT FORWARD, WOODLANDS) AND 3.45% IN NONFORESTS. THESE POPULATION DECLINES WERE ACCOMPANIED BY ECOSYSTEM-WIDE DECLINES IN VEGETATION TYPES OF 1.36% AND 0.32% PER YEAR FOR FORESTS AND WOODLANDS, RESPECTIVELY; WE ESTIMATED AN ANNUAL INCREASE OF 1.35% FOR NONFORESTS. OUR MODEL PREDICTED THE HIGHEST CHIMPANZEE DENSITY IN FORESTS (0.86 CHIMPANZEES/KM2, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) 0.60–1.23; AS OF 2020), FOLLOWED BY WOODLANDS (0.19, 95% CI 0.12–0.30) AND NONFORESTS (0.18, 95% CI 0.10–1.33). ALTHOUGH FORESTS REPRESENT ONLY 6% OF THE LANDSCAPE, THEY SUPPORT NEARLY ONE-QUARTER OF THE CHIMPANZEE POPULATION (769 CHIMPANZEES, 95% CI 536–1103). WOODLANDS DOMINATE THE LANDSCAPE (71%) AND THEREFORE SUPPORT MORE THAN A HALF OF THE CHIMPANZEE POPULATION (2294; 95% CI 1420–3707). THE REMAINING QUARTER OF THE LANDSCAPE IS REPRESENTED BY NONFORESTS AND SUPPORTS ANOTHER QUARTER OF THE CHIMPANZEE POPULATION (750; 95% CI 408–1381). GIVEN THE PRESSURES ON THE REMAINING SUITABLE HABITAT IN TANZANIA, AND THE NEED OF CHIMPANZEES TO ACCESS BOTH FOREST AND WOODLAND VEGETATION TO SURVIVE, WE URGE FUTURE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TO INCREASE RESOURCES AND EXPAND THE EFFORTS TO PROTECT CRITICAL FOREST AND WOODLAND HABITAT AND PROMOTE STRATEGIES AND POLICIES THAT MORE EFFECTIVELY PREVENT IRREVERSIBLE LOSSES.

HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF LOCAL VERSUS REGIONAL TREE MIXING ON ASSOCIATED BIODIVERSITY AND NOTABLY THE MODIFYING ROLE OF TREE SPECIES GROWING OUTSIDE THEIR NATURAL RANGE REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE ASSESSED HOW MONOCULTURES AND MIXTURES OF NATIVE AND INTRODUCED TREE SPECIES INFLUENCE THE TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF BIRD COMMUNITIES AT STAND AND LANDSCAPE SCALES IN NORTH-WEST GERMANY.

NEVERTHELESS, THIS IMPACT COULD BE BUFFERED BY THE INCREASING EXPANSION OF SECONDARY (REGENERATING) FORESTS, WHICH CAN PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTARY HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE. OBJECTIVES: WE TESTED THIS HYPOTHESIS ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF OLD-GROWTH AND SECONDARY FOREST COVER ON THE ABUNDANCE AND IMMATURE-TO-FEMALE RATIO (PROXY OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS) OF TWO ENDANGERED PRIMATES: GEOFFROY’ SPIDER MONKEYS AND BLACK HOWLER MONKEYS. METHODS: WE MEASURED THE RESPONSE AND PREDICTOR VARIABLES ACROSS 18 WHOLE LANDSCAPES (LANDSCAPE-SCALE APPROACH) IN THE LACANDONA RAINFOREST, MEXICO. AS THERE COULD BE TIPPING POINTS OF FOREST LOSS BEYOND WHICH SPECIES EXTINCTION IS ACCELERATED (EXTINCTION THRESHOLDS), WE SEPARATELY TESTED THE LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR EFFECT OF FOREST COVER ON EACH RESPONSE, INDEPENDENTLY FOR THREE SPATIAL SCALES. RESULTS: WE FOUND STRONGER AND LARGER-SCALE NEGATIVE RESPONSES TO FOREST LOSS IN SPIDER MONKEYS THAN IN HOWLER MONKEYS. HOWEVER, THE DATA WERE BETTER PREDICTED BY LINEAR MODELS, GIVING NO SUPPORT TO THE EXTINCTION THRESHOLD HYPOTHESIS. IN BOTH SPECIES, FOREST LOSS HAD STRONGER NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON MONKEY ABUNDANCE WHEN CONSIDERING OLD-GROWTH FOREST, THAN WHEN CONSIDERING SECONDARY FOREST COVER, OR TOTAL (OLD-GROWTH + SECONDARY) FOREST COVER. YET, THE IMMATURE-TO-FEMALE RATIO WAS WEAKLY RELATED TO FOREST COVER IN BOTH SPECIES. CONCLUSION: SECONDARY FORESTS SEEM TO HAVE A WEAK BUFFERING EFFECT IN BOTH SPECIES, POSSIBLY BECAUSE THEY ARE RELATIVELY YOUNG (< 30 YEARS OLD) AND DO NOT HAVE LARGE TREES. THIS IMPLIES THAT OLD-GROWTH FORESTS ARE IRREPLACEABLE FOR PREVENTING PRIMATE EXTIRPATION, ESPECIALLY FOR SPECIES WITH SPECIALIZED DIET AND LARGE SPATIAL REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS SPIDER MONKEYS. © 2022, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER NATURE B.V.",NA,NA,LAECE,"ARROYO-RODRÍGUEZ, V.; INSTITUTO DE INVESTIGACIONES EN ECOSISTEMAS Y SUSTENTABILIDAD, MICHOACÁN, MEXICO; EMAIL: VICTORARROYO_RODRIGUEZ@HOTMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1007/s10980-022-01532-7,"CONSEJO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGÍACONSEJO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGÍA, CONACYT, 2016-285940",9212973,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,12,3223-3238,SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,CAN SECONDARY FORESTS MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF OLD-GROWTH FOREST LOSS ON BIODIVERSITY?

RACCOON DOG (NYCTEREUTES PROCYONOIDES) THAT PREVIOUSLY INHABITED SHANGHAI HAD BEEN EXTIRPATED FROM THE METROPOLITAN AREA BUT RECENTLY RETURNED TO AND EXPANDED IN ALMOST ALL DISTRICTS, CAUSING HUNDREDS OF HUMAN-RACCOON DOG CONFLICTS.

BY CONSTRUCTING AN ENSEMBLE MODELING USING DATA FROM CAMERA TRAP SURVEYS, INTERVIEWS AND RESCUING RECORDS, WE FOUND THAT RACCOON DOG DISTRIBUTION WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL ANTHROPOGENIC FACTORS INCLUDING NIGHTTIME LIGHT, HUMAN POPULATION, AND PERCENTAGE AREA OF BUILDINGS.

HOWEVER, REPTILE POPULATIONS ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO MONITOR GIVEN THE FREQUENCY OF CRYPSIS IN THEIR LIFE HISTORY. THIS DIFFICULTY HAS LEFT UNCERTAIN THE CONSERVATION STATUS OF MANY SPECIES AND THE EFFICACY OF CONSERVATION ACTIONS UNKNOWN. ENVIRONMENTAL DNA (EDNA) SURVEYS CONSISTENTLY ELEVATE THE DETECTION RATE OF SPECIES THEY ARE DESIGNED TO MONITOR, AND WHILE THEIR USE IS PROMISING FOR TERRESTRIAL REPTILE CONSERVATION, SUCCESSES IN DEVELOPING SUCH SURVEYS HAVE BEEN SPARSE. WE TESTED THE DEGREE TO WHICH INCLUSION OF SURFACE AND SOIL EDNA SAMPLING INTO CONVENTIONAL ARTIFICIAL-COVER METHODS ELEVATES THE DETECTION PROBABILITY OF A SMALL, CRYPTIC TERRESTRIAL LIZARD, SCINCELLA LATERALIS. THE EDNA SAMPLING OF COVER OBJECT SURFACES WITH PAINT ROLLERS ELEVATED PER SAMPLE DETECTION PROBABILITIES FOR THIS SPECIES 4–16 TIMES COMPARED WITH VISUAL SURVEYS ALONE. WE READILY DETECTED S. LATERALIS EDNA UNDER COVER OBJECTS UP TO 2 WEEKS AFTER THE LAST VISUAL DETECTION, AND AT SOME COVER OBJECTS WHERE NO S. LATERALIS WERE VISUALLY OBSERVED IN PRIOR MONTHS. WITH SUFFICIENT SAMPLING INTENSITY, EDNA TESTING OF SOIL UNDER COVER OBJECTS PRODUCED COMPARABLE PER SAMPLE DETECTION PROBABILITIES AS ROLLER SURFACE METHODS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT COMBINING EDNA AND COVER OBJECT METHODS CAN CONSIDERABLY INCREASE THE DETECTION POWER OF REPTILE MONITORING PROGRAMS, ALLOWING MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF POPULATION SIZE, DETECTION OF TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL CHANGES IN HABITAT USE, AND TRACKING SUCCESS OF RESTORATION EFFORTS.

HOWEVER, COVID-19 IS JUST ONE OF SEVERAL HIGH-IMPACT INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT EMERGED FROM WILDLIFE AND ARE LINKED TO THE HUMAN RELATIONSHIP WITH NATURE. THE RATE OF EMERGENCE OF NEW ZOONOSES (DISEASES OF ANIMAL ORIGIN) IS INCREASING, DRIVEN BY HUMAN-INDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES THAT THREATEN BIODIVERSITY ON A GLOBAL SCALE. THIS INCREASE IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS INCLUDING BIODIVERSITY LOSS, CLIMATE CHANGE AND UNSUSTAINABLE RESOURCE EXTRACTION. AUSTRALIA IS A BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT AND IS SUBJECT TO SUSTAINED AND SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, INCREASING THE RISK OF IT BEING A LOCATION FOR PANDEMIC ORIGIN. MOREOVER, THE GLOBAL INTEGRATION OF MARKETS MEANS THAT CONSUMPTION TRENDS IN AUSTRALIA CONTRIBUTES TO THE RISK OF DISEASE SPILL-OVER IN OUR REGIONAL NEIGHBOURS IN ASIA-PACIFIC, AND BEYOND. DESPITE THE CLEAR CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURES ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND INCREASING PANDEMIC RISKS, AUSTRALIA’S RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, LIKE MOST OF THE WORLD, HAS CENTRED LARGELY ON PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGIES, WITH A CLEAR FOCUS ON REACTIVE MANAGEMENT. YET, THE SPAN OF EXPERTISE AND EVIDENCE RELEVANT TO THE GOVERNANCE OF PANDEMIC RISK MANAGEMENT IS MUCH WIDER THAN PUBLIC HEALTH AND EPIDEMIOLOGY. IT INVOLVES ANIMAL/WILDLIFE HEALTH, BIOSECURITY, CONSERVATION SCIENCES, SOCIAL SCIENCES, BEHAVIOURAL PSYCHOLOGY, LAW, POLICY AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES TO NAME JUST A FEW. THE AUTHORS ARE A TEAM OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY PRACTITIONERS AND RESEARCHERS WHO HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO ANALYSE, SYNTHESISE, AND HARMONISE THE LINKS BETWEEN PANDEMIC RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACHES AND ISSUES IN DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES TO PROVIDE A HOLISTIC OVERVIEW OF CURRENT PRACTICE, AND CONCLUDE THE NEED FOR REFORM IN AUSTRALIA. WE DISCUSS THE ADOPTION OF A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTERDISCIPLINARY ‘ONE HEALTH’ APPROACH TO PANDEMIC RISK MANAGEMENT IN AUSTRALIA. A KEY GOAL OF THE ONE HEALTH APPROACH IS TO BE PROACTIVE IN COUNTERING THREATS OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND ZOONOSES THROUGH A RECOGNITION OF THE INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN HUMAN, ANIMAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. DEVELOPING WAYS TO IMPLEMENT A ONE HEALTH APPROACH TO PANDEMIC PREVENTION WOULD NOT ONLY REDUCE THE RISK OF FUTURE PANDEMICS EMERGING IN OR ENTERING AUSTRALIA, BUT ALSO PROVIDE A MODEL FOR PREVENTION STRATEGIES AROUND THE WORLD. © 2022, THE AUTHOR(S).",73,NA,NA,"WOOLASTON, K.; SCHOOL OF LAW, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: KATIE.WOOLASTON@QUT.EDU.AU",ARTICLE,10.1186/s12992-022-00850-4,"NATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCILNATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, NHMRC DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE, AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTDEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE, AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, DFAT QUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGYQUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, QUT",17448603,GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH,ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,1,NA,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,35883185,SCOPUS,AN ARGUMENT FOR PANDEMIC RISK MANAGEMENT USING A MULTIDISCIPLINARY ONE HEALTH APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE: AN AUSTRALIAN CASE STUDY,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134758555&doi=10.1186%2fs12992-022-00850-4&partnerID=40&md5=57b8adac2434048d5e9c8c5392e8317a,18,2022,"THE WORKSHOPS AND WRITING OF THIS PAPER WAS FUNDED BY THE QUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (INCLUDING THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY VICE CHANCELLOR OF RESEARCH, THE CENTRE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THE CENTRE FOR JUSTICE).

HERE, WE INVESTIGATE THE IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT CLIMATE SCENARIOS ON ALPHA AND BETA DIVERSITIES OF FOREST FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS. LOCATION: CENTRAL CORRIDOR OF THE ATLANTIC FOREST (CCAF), BRAZIL. METHODS: WE USED ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS TO PROJECT SPECIES DISTRIBUTION OF 68 FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS FOR THE BASELINE AND FUTURE (2050 AND 2070) SCENARIOS. WE GENERATED BINARY MAPS OF SUITABLE AREAS FOR EACH SPECIES BY CLIMATE SCENARIO TO CALCULATE ALPHA AND BETA DIVERSITIES. RESULTS: MOST FOREST FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS WERE PROJECTED TO LOSE SUITABLE AREA, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, REDUCING ALPHA DIVERSITY IN FUTURE SCENARIOS AND INCREASING TEMPORAL BETA DIVERSITY, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY THE NESTEDNESS COMPONENT. IN ADDITION, SPECIES RICHNESS DECREASED FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST PORTION OF THE CCAF, WHILE DIFFERENTIATION OF BIRD COMMUNITIES INCREASED IN THE SAME DIRECTION, A PATTERN CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL CLIMATE SCENARIOS EVALUATED. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: CLIMATE CHANGE MAY EXERT DRASTIC ALTERATIONS IN THE COMPOSITION OF FRUGIVOROUS BIRD COMMUNITIES IN THE CCAF. AS FOREST FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS ARE CRITICAL TO SEED DISPERSAL OF FOREST PLANT SPECIES, IMPOVERISHMENT OF THEIR COMMUNITIES CAN DRASTICALLY AFFECT FOREST REGENERATION, DIVERSITY, AND STRUCTURE IN THE DECADES TO COME. THEREFORE, A BETTER COMPREHENSION OF SPATIO-TEMPORAL CHANGES IN DIVERSITY PATTERNS OF FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS CAN HELP US TO AVOID THE DISRUPTION OF SEED DISPERSAL AND ITS CONSEQUENCES, SUCH AS CASCADING EFFECTS THAT WILL TRIGGER BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN THE CCAF. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

LOWER OCEAN PH LEVELS THREATEN MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND ESPECIALLY STRONGLY CALCIFYING SPECIES. IMPACTS ON MARINE ECOSYSTEM QUALITY ARE CURRENTLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTS (LCAS). HERE, WE DEVELOPED CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS FOR THE LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION. OUR MAIN CONTRIBUTION WAS DEVELOPING NEW SPECIES SENSITIVITY DISTRIBUTIONS (SSDS), FROM WHICH WE DERIVED EFFECT FACTORS FOR DIFFERENT IMPACT PERSPECTIVES: MARGINAL, LINEAR, AND AVERAGE CHANGES FOR BOTH THE PAST AND FOUR FUTURE EMISSION SCENARIOS (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, AND RCP8.5). BASED ON A DATASET THAT COVERED FIVE TAXA (CORALS, CRUSTACEANS, ECHINODERMS, FISHES, MOLLUSCS) AND THREE CLIMATE ZONES, WE SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SENSITIVITIES FOR STRONGLY CALCIFYING THAN SLIGHTLY CALCIFYING TAXA AND IN POLAR REGIONS COMPARED TO TROPICAL AND TEMPERATE REGIONS. EXPERIMENTAL DURATION, LEADING TO ACUTE, SUBCHRONIC, OR CHRONIC TOXICOLOGICAL ENDPOINTS, DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE SPECIES SENSITIVITIES. WITH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION IMPACTS STILL ACCELERATING, THE FUTURE-ORIENTED AVERAGE EFFECTS ARE HIGHER THAN THE MARGINAL OR PAST-ORIENTED AVERAGE EFFECTS. WHILE OUR CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS ARE READY FOR USE IN LCA, WE ALSO POINT TO OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT IN FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE PROCESS OF FOUNDING NEW POPULATIONS FOR SUCH SPECIES OR THE FEASIBILITY OF ASSISTED COLONISATIONS AS A VIABLE CONSERVATION MEASURE. HERE, WE COMBINED GENETICS WITH REPRODUCTIVE DATA TO STUDY THE RISE OF TWO WILD POPULATIONS OF GREEN TURTLES (CHELONIA MYDAS) IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AS A POSSIBLE OUTCOME OF A REINTRODUCTION PROGRAM STARTED 50 YEARS AGO. WE SHOW THAT BOTH POPULATIONS ARE HIGHLY RELATED TO THE CAPTIVE POPULATION BUT RAPIDLY DIVERGED DUE TO GENETIC DRIFT. INDIVIDUALS FROM THE REINTRODUCED POPULATIONS SHOWED HIGH LEVELS OF NEST FIDELITY, WITHIN AND ACROSS NESTING SEASONS, INDICATING THAT PHILOPATRY MAY HELP REINFORCE THE SUCCESS OF NEW POPULATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE SHOW THAT REINTRODUCTION FROM CAPTIVE POPULATIONS HAS NOT UNDERMINED THE REPRODUCTIVE FITNESS OF FIRST GENERATION INDIVIDUALS.

LOCATION: BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST (BAF). METHODS: WE BUILT A FOREST REGENERATION SCENARIO VIA A MODEL OF SEED DISPERSAL BASED ON THE POTENTIAL MOVEMENT OF FRUGIVOROUS FAUNA AND PROJECTED THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF 356 BIRD SPECIES AND 21 ARBOREAL MAMMALS BASED ON SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS (SDM) WHICH EMPLOYED 79,462 OCCURRENCE RECORDS AND FOUR ALGORITHMS FOR DIFFERENT CLIMATE AND LANDSCAPE SCENARIOS. SDM WERE BASED ON CLIMATE AND LANDSCAPE PREDICTORS SEPARATELY AND THE RESULTS WERE COMBINED INTO MAPS OF SPECIES RICHNESS. FINALLY, WE ASSESSED THE SPECIES’ RISK OF EXTINCTION BASED ON THE SPECIES–AREA RELATIONSHIP. RESULTS: WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION AREA FOR EACH SPECIES INCREASES ON AVERAGE BY 72.5% (SD = 8%) IN THE SCENARIO OF POTENTIAL REGENERATION. CLIMATE CHANGE DECREASES THE AREA OF POTENTIAL OCCURRENCE OF 252 SPECIES, WHICH MAY SUFFER A MEAN REDUCTION OF 74.4% (SD = 9.3%) IN THEIR CURRENT POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION AREAS. BAF REGIONS WITH THE LARGEST AMOUNTS OF FOREST HAD THE GREATEST POTENTIAL RICHNESS OF SPECIES. IN FUTURE CLIMATE SCENARIO, 3.4% OF SPECIES MAY BECOME EXTINCT, BUT WE SHOW THAT LARGE-SCALE REGENERATION MAY PREVENT THESE EXTINCTIONS. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: DESPITE THE POSSIBLE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF 67% OF THE STUDIED SPECIES, WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE RISK OF SPECIES EXTINCTION, OUR ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT PROMOTING LARGE-SCALE BAF RESTORATION BASED ON NATURAL REGENERATION MAY PREVENT BIODIVERSITY LOSS. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

WE INTRODUCE NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN DRYLAND STREAMS (NIDS), WHICH ARE STRUCTURES NATURALLY OR ANTHROPOGENICALLY CREATED FROM EARTH, WOOD, DEBRIS, OR ROCK THAT CAN RESTORE IMPLICIT FUNCTION OF THESE SYSTEMS. THIS MANUSCRIPT FURTHER DISCUSSES THE CAPABILITY OF AND FUNCTIONAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN BEAVER DAMS AND ANTHROPOGENIC NIDS, DOCUMENTED BY DECADES OF SCIENTIFIC STUDY. IN ADDITION, WE PRESENT THE NOVEL, EVIDENCE-BASED FINDING THAT NIDS CAN CREATE WETLANDS IN WATER-SCARCE RIPARIAN ZONES, WITH SOIL ORGANIC CARBON STOCK AS MUCH AS 200 TO 1400 MG C/HA IN THE TOP METER OF SOIL. WE IDENTIFY THE KEY RESTORATIVE ACTION OF NIDS, WHICH IS TO SLOW THE DRAINAGE OF WATER FROM THE LANDSCAPE SUCH THAT MORE OF IT CAN INFILTRATE AND BE USED TO FACILITATE NATURAL PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN FLUVIAL ENVIRONMENTS. SPECIFICALLY, WE ASSERT THAT THE RAPID DRAINAGE OF WATER FROM SUCH ENVIRONMENTS CAN BE REVERSED THROUGH THE RESTORATION OF NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ONCE EXISTED.

WE PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF HOW NIDS HAVE BEEN USED TO RESTORE SUCH FEEDBACK LOOPS, THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM INSTALLATION OF NIDS IN THE DRYLAND STREAMS OF THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES, HOW SUCH EFFORTS MIGHT BE SCALED UP, AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE FOR MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS.

IN THIS WORK, COMBINED INFORMATION ON THE ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS, DIVERSITY INDICES, SPECIES COMPOSITION, TROPHIC LEVEL AND VULNERABILITY INDEX WERE EXAMINED FOR THE FIRST-TIME TO DETECT DIFFERENCES IN FIVE UNITS RELATED TO TRAWL FISHING: THE FISH ASSEMBLAGE ENTERING THE TRAWL CODEND, AND THE ESCAPING, RETAINED, DISCARDED AND LANDED FRACTIONS, DERIVED BY THE GEAR AND FISHER SELECTION PRACTICES. THE WORK WAS BASED ON A CASE STUDY CONDUCTED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA, USING THREE DIFFERENT MESHES IN THE TRAWL CODEND (40MM-40D AND 50MM-50D DIAMOND MESHES, AND 40 MM-40S SQUARE MESHES) AND A COVER OF THE CODENDS WITH SMALL MESH SIZE. IN GENERAL, TRAWL FISHING PRODUCES AN ESCAPING FRACTION THAT WAS ALWAYS LOWER IN ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS, AND VULNERABILITY INDEX, SIMILAR IN DIVERSITY INDICES AND TROPHIC LEVEL, AND DIFFERENT IN SPECIES COMPOSITION COMPARED TO THE FISH ASSEMBLAGE ENTERING THE CODEND. IN ALMOST ALL CASES, FISHERS SELECTED AS LANDINGS A FRACTION THAT WAS THE LOWEST IN DIVERSITY INDICES, AND THE HIGHEST IN TROPHIC LEVEL. IN CONTRAST, FISHERS DISCARDED A FRACTION THAT WAS THE HIGHEST IN DIVERSITY AND VULNERABILITY INDEX, AND THE LOWEST IN TROPHIC LEVEL. ALTHOUGH THE THREE CODENDS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FRACTION OF ESCAPEES IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY INDICES, TROPHIC LEVEL, AND VULNERABILITY INDEX, THE 40S CODEND SHOWED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PERCENTAGE IN THE ESCAPING NUMBER OF SPECIES AND INDIVIDUALS, AND LESS DIFFERENCES IN THE SPECIES COMPOSITION; IN ADDITION, LOWER PERCENTAGE IN ABUNDANCE OF DISCARDS AND HIGHER OF LANDINGS IN THE RETAINED CATCH (0.6:1) THAN DID THE OTHER TWO CODENDS (0.9:1). IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT AN URGENT MODIFICATION OF THE TRAWL FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE DISCARDED HIGHLY VULNERABLE SPECIES (E.G. ELASMOBRANCHS) IS NEEDED, AND THAT TRAWL SPECIES-SELECTIVITY SHOULD BE IMPROVED BY ALLOWING ESCAPE OR AVOIDING CATCH OF THE DISCARDED FRACTION TO MINIMIZE BIODIVERSITY LOSSES.

AS INTRODUCED, POPULATIONS MAY INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE AND EXPAND GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE, SO DOES THE POTENTIAL FOR NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON NATIVE COMMUNITIES. AS SUCH, IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESSES DRIVING RANGE EXPANSION, BEFORE A SPECIES BECOMES ESTABLISHED IN NEW AREAS. THROUGH AN INVESTIGATION INTO CAPACITY FOR POPULATION GROWTH AND RANGE EXPANSION OF INTRODUCED POPULATIONS OF A NON-NATIVE LIZARD, WE AIMED TO DEMONSTRATE HOW MULTI-SCALE FACTORS INFLUENCE SPATIAL SPREAD, POPULATION GROWTH, AND INVASION POTENTIAL IN INTRODUCED SPECIES. THE ITALIAN WALL LIZARD (PODARCIS SICULUS) WAS INTRODUCED MULTIPLE TIMES TO THE UNITED STATES WITH EXTANT POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA, KANSAS, NEW JERSEY, AND NEW YORK. RECENTLY, A SINGLE SPECIMEN WAS DISCOVERED IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA, AND UNSTUDIED POPULATIONS ARE ON ORCAS ISLAND AND MISSOURI (USA). WE USED PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF MTDNA SEQUENCES (CYTB GENE) OF INDIVIDUALS SAMPLED FROM THESE INTRODUCED POPULATIONS AND ACROSS THE NATIVE RANGE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SOURCE POPULATIONS. OUR PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS RESULT WITH DOCUMENTATION OF THE INTRODUCTIONS REVEALED THAT THE CANADIAN INDIVIDUAL IS DERIVED FROM THE TUSCANY CLADE (TOGETHER WITH SAMPLES FROM KANSAS AND NEW YORK).

THIS STUDY USES SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS AND GENETIC ANALYSIS TO (1) IDENTIFY THE EVIDENCE OF INTRASPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN THE POPULATION SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE THREE EXTANT LINEAGES (SICHUAN/GANSU (SG), QINLING (QL) AND SHENNONGJIA (SNJ)) OF SICHUAN SNUB-NOSED MONKEYS AND (2) DETERMINE WHY SOME LINEAGES HAVE LOWER POPULATION NUMBERS, A SMALLER GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION, AND ARE MORE THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION. LOCATION: CHINA. METHODS: WE USED N-DIMENSIONAL HYPERVOLUME MODELLING AND GENOTYPE-ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATION (GEA) MODELS TO COMPARE THE CLIMATIC NICHES OF THREE SNUB-NOSED MONKEY LINEAGES, SDMS TO RECONSTRUCT THE HISTORICAL, CURRENT AND FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS OF EACH LINEAGE AND SMC++ TO CALCULATE THEIR EFFECTIVE POPULATION SIZES. RESULTS: WE FOUND EVIDENCE OF: (1) CLIMATIC NICHE DIFFERENTIATION AMONG THE SG, QL AND SNJ LINEAGES OF SICHUAN SNUB-NOSED MONKEYS; (2) GEOGRAPHICAL ISOLATION COMBINED WITH A DECREASE IN POPULATION SIZE DURING THE LGM RESULTED IN ECOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATION AMONG THESE THREE LINEAGES; AND (3) A DECLINE IN CLIMATIC SUITABILITY AND ANTHROPOGENICALLY DRIVEN LAND CONVERSION, COMBINED WITH SMALL POPULATION SIZE AND A NARROW DISTRIBUTIONAL RANGE, INDICATES THAT THE SNJ LINEAGE IS AT A GREATER RISK OF EXTINCTION THAN THE SG AND QL LINEAGES. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: WE DEMONSTRATE THAT DURING THE LGM A REDUCTION IN HABITAT SUITABILITY DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE, IN CONCERT WITH DECREASING POPULATION SIZE, RESULTED IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL ISOLATION OF THE THREE SICHUAN SNUB-NOSED MONKEY SUBPOPULATIONS, LEADING TO LINEAGE DIFFERENCES IN ECOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATION. GEA MODELS AND HYPERVOLUME MODELS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE THREE LINEAGES OCCUPY DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL NICHES. BASED ON LINEAGE-LEVEL MODELS, THE SNJ AND QL LINEAGES SHOULD BE THE IMMEDIATE FOCUS OF CONSERVATION EFFORTS DUE TO THEIR SMALL EFFECTIVE POPULATION SIZE AND EXPECTED FUTURE REDUCTIONS IN AVAILABLE SUITABLE HABITATS.

LOCATION: CONTINENTAL AFRICA. METHODS: WE COMPILED HISTORICAL RECORDS OF LION DISTRIBUTION TO GENERATE A RECENT HISTORICAL RANGE FOR THE SPECIES. HISTORICAL POPULATION SIZE WAS PREDICTED USING A GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODEL. RESISTANT KERNEL AND FACTORIAL LEAST-COST PATH ANALYSES WERE USED TO PREDICT RECENT HISTORICAL LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY AND COMPARE THIS WITH CONTEMPORARY CONNECTIVITY AT CONTINENTAL, REGIONAL AND COUNTRY SCALES. RESULTS: WE ESTIMATE A BASELINE POPULATION OF ~92,054 (83,017–101,094 95% CI) LIONS IN C1970, SUGGESTING AFRICA'S LION POPULATION HAS DECLINED BY ~75%, OVER THE LAST FIVE DECADES. ALTHOUGH GREATLY REDUCED FROM HISTORICAL EXTENTS (C1500AD), RECENT HISTORICAL LION HABITAT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CONNECTED. HOWEVER, IN COMPARISON, CONTEMPORARY POPULATION CONNECTIVITY HAS DECLINED DRAMATICALLY, WITH MANY POPULATIONS NOW ISOLATED, AS WELL AS LARGE DECLINES WITHIN REMAINING POPULATION CORE AREAS. THIS DECLINE WAS MOST MARKED IN THE WEST AND CENTRAL REGION, WITH A 90% DECLINE IN CONNECTED HABITAT COMPARED WITH ITS C1970 EXTENT. THE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN REGIONS HAVE EXPERIENCED LOWER, THOUGH SIGNIFICANT, DECLINES IN CONNECTED HABITAT (44% AND 55%, RESPECTIVELY). CONTEMPORARY POPULATIONS ARE CONNECTED BY THREE NON-CORE HABITAT LINKAGES AND 15 POTENTIAL CORRIDORS (SPANNING UNCONNECTED HABITAT) THAT MAY ALLOW DISPERSAL AND GENE FLOW. DECLINING CONNECTIVITY MIRRORS RECENT STUDIES SHOWING LOSS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND INCREASING GENETIC ISOLATION OF LION POPULATIONS. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: WE PROVIDE AN EMPIRICALLY DERIVED BASELINE FOR AFRICAN LION POPULATION SIZE, HABITAT EXTENT AND CONNECTIVITY IN C1970 AND AT PRESENT AGAINST WHICH TO EVALUATE CONTEMPORARY CONSERVATION OF THE SPECIES, AVOIDING A SHIFTING BASELINE SYNDROME WHERE CONSERVATION SUCCESS/FAILURE IS MEASURED ONLY AGAINST RECENT POPULATION SIZE OR RANGE.

TO ADDRESS THIS, WE CONDUCTED A SPECIES-WIDE ASSESSMENT OF GENOMIC DIVERSITY IN THE NORTHERN QUOLL (DASYURUS HALLUCATUS), AN ENDANGERED MARSUPIAL CARNIVORE. WE USED NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING METHODS TO GENOTYPE 10,191 SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS (SNPS) IN 352 INDIVIDUALS FROM ACROSS A 3220-KM LENGTH OF THE CONTINENT, INVESTIGATING PATTERNS OF POPULATION GENOMIC STRUCTURE AND DIVERSITY, AND IDENTIFYING LOCI SHOWING SIGNALS OF PUTATIVE SELECTION. WE FOUND STRONG HETEROGENEITY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF GENOMIC DIVERSITY ACROSS THE CONTINENT, CHARACTERIZED BY (I) BIOGEOGRAPHICAL BARRIERS DRIVING HIERARCHICAL POPULATION STRUCTURE THROUGH LONG-TERM ISOLATION, AND (II) SEVERE REDUCTIONS IN DIVERSITY RESULTING FROM POPULATION DECLINES, EXACERBATED BY THE SPREAD OF INTRODUCED TOXIC CANE TOADS (RHINELLA MARINA). THESE RESULTS WARN OF A LARGE ONGOING LOSS OF GENOMIC DIVERSITY AND ASSOCIATED ADAPTIVE CAPACITY AS MAMMALS DECLINE ACROSS NORTHERN AUSTRALIA. ENCOURAGINGLY, POPULATIONS OF THE NORTHERN QUOLL ESTABLISHED ON TOAD-FREE ISLANDS BY TRANSLOCATIONS APPEAR TO HAVE MAINTAINED MOST OF THE INITIAL GENOMIC DIVERSITY AFTER 16 YEARS. BY MAPPING PATTERNS OF GENOMIC DIVERSITY WITHIN AND AMONG POPULATIONS, AND INVESTIGATING THESE PATTERNS IN THE CONTEXT OF POPULATION DECLINES, WE CAN PROVIDE CONSERVATION MANAGERS WITH DATA CRITICAL TO INFORMED DECISION-MAKING. THIS INCLUDES THE IDENTIFICATION OF POPULATIONS THAT ARE CANDIDATES FOR GENETIC MANAGEMENT, THE IMPORTANCE OF REMNANT ISLAND AND INSURANCE/TRANSLOCATED POPULATIONS FOR THE CONSERVATION OF GENETIC DIVERSITY, AND THE CHARACTERIZATION OF PUTATIVE EVOLUTIONARILY SIGNIFICANT UNITS. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

THE NORTH AMERICAN BAT MONITORING PROGRAM (NABAT) AIMS TO USE ITS TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE TO ASSESS STATUS AND TRENDS OF BAT POPULATIONS, WHILE DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE AND COMMUNITY-DRIVEN CONSERVATION SOLUTIONS. HERE, WE PRESENT NABAT ML, AN AUTOMATED MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHM THAT IMPROVES THE SCALABILITY AND SCIENTIFIC TRANSPARENCY OF NABAT ACOUSTIC MONITORING. THIS MODEL COMBINES SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) TO DETECT AND CLASSIFY RECORDED BAT ECHOLOCATION CALLS. WE DEVELOPED OUR CNN MODEL WITH INTERNET-BASED COMPUTING RESOURCES (‘CLOUD ENVIRONMENT’), AND TRAINED IT ON >600,000 SPECTROGRAM IMAGES. WE ALSO INCORPORATED SPECIES RANGE MAPS TO IMPROVE THE ROBUSTNESS AND ACCURACY OF THE MODEL FOR FUTURE ‘UNSEEN’ DATA. WE EVALUATED MODEL PERFORMANCE USING A COMPREHENSIVE, INDEPENDENT, HOLDOUT DATASET. NABAT ML SUCCESSFULLY DISTINGUISHED 31 CLASSES (30 SPECIES AND A NOISE CLASS) WITH OVERALL WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ACCURACY AND PRECISION RATES OF 92%, AND ≥90% CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY FOR 19 OF THE BAT SPECIES. USING A SINGLE CLOUD-ENVIRONMENT COMPUTING INSTANCE, THE ENTIRE MODEL TRAINING PROCESS TOOK <16 H. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN)-BASED MODEL, NABAT ML, CLASSIFIES 30 NORTH AMERICAN BAT SPECIES USING THEIR RECORDED ECHOLOCATION CALLS WITH AN OVERALL ACCURACY OF 92%. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING HIGHLY ACCURATE SPECIES-LEVEL CLASSIFICATION, NABAT ML AND ITS OUTPUTS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH BAYESIAN AND OTHER STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES FOR MEASURING UNCERTAINTY IN CLASSIFICATION. OUR MODEL IS OPEN-SOURCE AND REPRODUCIBLE, ENABLING FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS AS SOFTWARE ON END-USER DEVICES AND CLOUD-BASED WEB APPLICATIONS. THESE QUALITIES MAKE NABAT ML HIGHLY SUITABLE FOR APPLICATIONS RANGING FROM GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY SCIENCE INITIATIVES TO BIG-DATA METHODS DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED BY RESEARCHERS AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONERS. WE BELIEVE THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF NABAT ML WILL ENCOURAGE BROAD-SCALE PARTICIPATION IN BAT MONITORING, AND ENABLE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS NEEDED TO CONSERVE NORTH AMERICAN BAT SPECIES. © 2022 HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA AND THE AUTHORS.

HOWEVER, SPECIES-POOR HABITATS OFTEN HARBOUR DISTINCT, VALUABLE AND/OR FUNCTIONALLY UNIQUE SPECIES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO REGIONAL DIVERSITY. IN THE TROPICAL MARINE REALM, THE ‘MANGROVE-SEAGRASS-CORAL REEF CONTINUUM’ HAS DOMINATED BOTH THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING. BARE SEDIMENT HABITATS ARE ALSO PART OF THIS CONTINUUM AND OFTEN COMPRISE THE MAJORITY OF BOTTOM AREA, AS THEY DO IN MOST REGIONS WORLDWIDE, BUT ARE UNDERSTUDIED AND RARELY CONSIDERED IN CONSERVATION. TO ADDRESS THIS INFORMATION GAP, WE PARTITION THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FIVE HABITATS IN THE COASTAL MOSAIC (FOREREEFS, PATCH REEFS, SEAGRASS, MANGROVES AND BARE SAND) TO FISH DIVERSITY ACROSS A TROPICAL SEASCAPE. LOCATION: CARRIE BOW CAY, BELIZE BARRIER REEF. METHODS: USING DIVER VISUAL CENSUSES, WE ASSESSED FISH COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AT THREE REPLICATE SITES FROM EACH OF THE FIVE HABITATS ANNUALLY FOR 5 YEARS. WE THEN PARTITIONED DIVERSITY INTO WITHIN (Α) AND BETWEEN (Β) HABITAT CONTRIBUTIONS, AND FURTHER PARTITIONED Β-DIVERSITY INTO COMPONENTS ATTRIBUTED TO SPECIES REPLACEMENT AND RICHNESS DIFFERENCE. FINALLY, WE DETERMINED THE LOCAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO Β-DIVERSITY (LCBD) BY EACH HABITAT AND IDENTIFIED THE KEY INDIVIDUAL SPECIES BEHIND THESE CONTRIBUTIONS. MAIN RESULTS: TROPICAL SAND FLATS CONTRIBUTED UNIQUELY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY TO REGIONAL FISH SPECIES DIVERSITY, DESPITE HAVING THE FEWEST SPECIES OVERALL. SAND FLATS ALSO HAD HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED LOCAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO Β-DIVERSITY (LCBD) AND HAD THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF SPECIES NOT FOUND IN OTHER HABITATS. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT PREVIOUSLY UNDERSTUDIED SAND HABITATS HARBOUR A RELATIVELY UNIQUE ASSEMBLAGE OF SPECIES COMPARED WITH OTHER NEARBY HABITATS.

UNDERSTANDING THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN CARBON STORAGE AND BIODIVERSITY IS IMPORTANT TO MAXIMISE THE VALUE OF RESTORATION OPPORTUNITIES. ECOLOGICAL THEORY SUGGESTS BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY CONTRIBUTES POSITIVELY TO CARBON STORAGE UNTIL THE RELATIONSHIP PLATEAUS (I.E., SPECIES ARE ADDED WITH NO EFFECT ON CARBON STORAGE), AND YET IN PRACTICE, TREE MONOCULTURES ARE PERCEIVED TO SEQUESTER MORE CARBON THAN DIVERSE PLANTINGS. HERE, WE MEASURED THE CONTRIBUTION OF PLANT DIVERSITY TO CARBON STORAGE IN TREES AND SHRUBS TEN YEARS AFTER PLANTING FOR YATE (EUCALYPTUS OCCIDENTALIS) WOODLAND RESTORATION. WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE FOR A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN CARBON STORAGE AND PLANT DIVERSITY. WE PLANTED YATE WITH MIXES OF YATE WOODLAND SPECIES INCLUDING NATIVE GRASSES, SHRUBS, AND TREES. TEN YEARS AFTER PLANTING, GRASS ESTABLISHMENT WAS POOR, AND DENSITY OF TREES AND SHRUBS WAS PATCHY. THERE WAS SOME UNASSISTED RECRUITMENT OF WOODY SPECIES. DIVERSITY WAS MEASURED AS OBSERVED SPECIES RICHNESS AND OBSERVED FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS, WHICH INCORPORATED TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY, STRUCTURAL DIVERSITY, AND PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF NITROGEN-FIXING LEGUMES. CARBON STOCKS MEASURED WERE ABOVE AND BELOWGROUND TREE AND SHRUB BIOMASS, LEAF AND TWIG LITTER BIOMASS, AND ORGANIC CARBON (%) IN THE TOPSOIL. ACROSS ALL THREE CARBON STOCKS DIVERSE YATE PLANTINGS SEQUESTERED AS MUCH CARBON AS YATE MONOCULTURES. OBSERVED SPECIES RICHNESS HAD A WEAK NEGATIVE EFFECT ON TREE AND SHRUB BIOMASS IN THE BEST LINEAR MIXED MODEL BUT THIS EFFECT DIMINISHED WITH THE REMOVAL OF AN OUTLIER. TREE DENSITY HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON TREE AND SHRUB BIOMASS IN MODELS WITH AND WITHOUT THE OUTLIER. THERE WAS NO EFFECT OF DIVERSITY ON LITTER BIOMASS AND SOIL ORGANIC CARBON. INSTEAD, LINEAR MIXED MODELS OF THESE STOCKS SHOWED THE INFLUENCE OF SOIL PROPERTIES. LITTER BIOMASS INCREASED WITH SOIL POTASSIUM AND DECREASED WITH SOIL PH. SOIL ORGANIC CARBON INCREASED WITH INITIAL SOIL ORGANIC CARBON AND SOIL NITROGEN. THERE ARE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL BIODIVERSITY BENEFITS OF DIVERSE PLANTINGS THAT WE DID NOT MEASURE (E.G., SOIL EROSION CONTROL, WILDLIFE HABITAT).

METHODS FOR MONITORING THE SPREAD OF ALIEN INVASIVE PLANTS ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATE IMPACT ON LOCAL BIODIVERSITY. RECENT ADVANCES IN DEEP LEARNING AND IMAGE FUSION HOLDS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR MAPPING AND MANAGING ALIEN INVASIVE PLANTS. ONE SUCH METHOD IS SUPER-RESOLUTION IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION, WHERE A NEURAL NETWORK LEARNS TO DOWNSCALE IMAGES FROM COARSE TO FINE RESOLUTION. WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL TIMBER PRODUCTION LANDSCAPE OF KWAZULU-NATAL, ENDANGERED GRASSLAND CORRIDORS ARE THREATENED BY AMERICAN BRAMBLE INVASION, IMPACTING PLANTS, BIRDS, ARTHROPODS, AND SOIL RESTORATION. HERE WE AIM TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BRAMBLE INVASION DYNAMICS THROUGH USING SUPER-RESOLVED SATELLITE MOSAICS. BRAMBLE WAS CLASSIFIED WITH VERY HIGH ACCURACIES (85%) FROM THE SUPER-RESOLVED SATELLITE MOSAIC, COMPARED TO OTHER CONVENTIONAL SATELLITE IMAGERY WITH DIFFERENT SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS. USING LANDSCAPE ANALYSES, WE IDENTIFIED PLANTATION TREE HARVESTING AND PRESCRIBED BURNING TO BE MAJOR DRIVERS INCREASING BRAMBLE COVER WITHIN THE LANDSCAPE. BRAMBLE COVER WAS HIGHEST ONE YEAR FOLLOWING PLANTATION TREE HARVESTING. CONTINUOUS PRESCRIBED BURNING POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BRAMBLE. BRAMBLE COVER WAS ALSO HIGH CLOSE TO STREAMS, AND UNDER FUTURE INVASION PROJECTIONS, BRAMBLE WILL SEVERELY IMPACT ENSIFERA SPECIES ALONGSIDE LOW PRIORITY GRASSHOPPER SPECIES HABITAT. RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT BRAMBLE HAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INTERMEDIATE PRIORITY GRASSHOPPERS AND PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS. FOR CONTROLLING BRAMBLE INVASION WITHIN COMMERCIAL TIMBER PRODUCTION LANDSCAPES, WE RECOMMEND THE ADOPTION ROTATIONAL HARVESTING, AS HARVESTING ENTIRE PLANTATION BLOCKS THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPE WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE INVASION POTENTIAL OF BRAMBLE. CURRENT BRAMBLE REMOVAL PROGRAMMES SHOULD PRIORITIZE RIPARIAN AREAS. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS NEEDED TO CONTROL BRAMBLE ONE YEAR AFTER TIMBER HARVESTING, AS THIS IS WHEN BRAMBLE COVER IS HIGHEST.

AS EARTH WARMS, MANY SPECIES RESPOND BY SHIFTING THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL RANGES EITHER POLEWARDS, OR IN MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS, UPSLOPE TOWARDS HIGHER ELEVATIONS, PRESUMABLY TO TRACK SUITABLE THERMAL ENVIRONMENTS. UPSLOPE RANGE SHIFTS ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN IN TROPICAL MOUNTAIN RANGES BECAUSE: (A) TROPICAL SPECIES ARE PARTICULARLY THERMALLY SENSITIVE; (B) SPECIES MOVING UPWARDS COULD BECOME LOCALLY EXTIRPATED AS THEY RUN OUT OF HABITABLE SPACE; AND (C) TROPICAL MOUNTAINS HARBOR A HIGH FRACTION OF EARTH'S TERRESTRIAL BIODIVERSITY. RAPID UPSLOPE SHIFTS CAN, THEREFORE, RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT BIODIVERSITY LOSSES. WE USED COMMUNITY SCIENCE DATA OVER A 13-YEAR PERIOD TO EVALUATE WHETHER 93 EASTERN HIMALAYAN BIRD SPECIES MIGHT BE SHIFTING TO HIGHER ELEVATIONS. TO DO THIS, WE ANALYZED CHANGES IN THEIR OCCURRENCE PROBABILITIES IN EBIRD CHECKLISTS FROM BIRDWATCHING HOTSPOTS AT FIXED ELEVATIONS. WE FOUND PATTERNS CONSISTENT WITH UPSLOPE RANGE SHIFTS; SPECIES WITH ELEVATIONAL RANGES PRIMARILY BELOW HOTSPOT ELEVATIONS SHOW INCREASES IN THEIR OCCURRENCE PROBABILITY OVER TIME, AND THOSE WITH MOST OF THEIR ELEVATIONAL RANGES ABOVE A HOTSPOT ELEVATION DECLINE IN OCCURRENCE PROBABILITY. OUR FINDINGS ARE SUGGESTIVE OF RAPID RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE BY EASTERN HIMALAYAN BIRDS. WE CAUTION THAT EASTERN HIMALAYAN BIRD SPECIES MIGHT BE AT SPECIAL RISK FROM INCREASING GLOBAL TEMPERATURES BECAUSE OF HEIGHTENED THERMAL SENSITIVITY COUPLED WITH HIGH RATES OF WARMING IN THE REGION.

RARE SPECIES ARE MUCH MORE SPATIALLY RESTRICTED AND USUALLY SHOW HIGHER HABITAT SPECIALIZATION, SO THEY CAN BE MUCH MORE VULNERABLE TO LANDSCAPE CHANGES THAN COMMON SPECIES. WE SIMULATED THREE SPECIES-LOSS SCENARIOS TO ASSESS HOW DIFFERENT GROUPS OF STREAM FISH SPECIES RESPOND TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SPATIAL VARIABLES AND HOW POTENTIAL EXTINCTIONS AFFECTED REGIONAL FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS AND THE AVERAGE FUNCTIONAL DISTINCTIVENESS. RARE AND COMMON SPECIES CONTRIBUTE SIMILARLY TO THE GLOBAL FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS, BUT THE LOSS OF COMMON SPECIES LED TO A MARKED DECREASE IN LOCAL REDUNDANCY. WHILST INTERMEDIATE AND RARE SPECIES ARE REGULATED BY DISPERSAL, DOMINANT SPECIES RESPOND TO NICHE PROCESSES AND ARE MORE AFFECTED BY LAND-USE CHANGES. THEREFORE, COMMON AND RARE SPECIES ARE UNDER DISTINCT ASSEMBLY RULES AND MAY EXHIBIT DISTINCT RESPONSES IN THE FACE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANTHROPIZATION. ADDRESSING RARE SPECIES IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED, DESPITE CONSTANT CLAIMS REGARDING THEIR IMPORTANCE AND THEIR FREQUENTLY CONCERNING CONSERVATION STATUS.

THE EXPANSION OF PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS FOREST PLANTATIONS, OFTEN RESULTS IN THE LOSS AND DEGRADATION OF NATIVE FORESTS, AFFECTING NATIVE SPECIES IN MANY WAYS. WHILE MANY STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF HABITAT DEGRADATION ON TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY, THE EFFECTS ON FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY HAVE BEEN LITTLE EXPLORED. FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY PROVIDES A ROBUST FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE CHANGES BIODIVERSITY. WE ASSESSED HOW BIRD FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY CHANGES ALONG A HABITAT DEGRADATION GRADIENT IN THE VALDIVIAN RAINFORESTS (SOUTHERN CHILE). WE USED FOUR FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY INDICES AND COMPARED FOUR HABITAT TYPES (OLD-GROWTH, SECONDARY, AND LOGGED NATIVE FORESTS AND EXOTIC PLANTATIONS) TO ASSESS HOW FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY CHANGES DEPENDING ON HABITAT STRUCTURE AND BIRD LIFE HISTORY, AND BEHAVIORAL TRAITS. WE FOUND THAT MOST FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY DIFFERENCES OCCUR BETWEEN OLD GROWTH AND SECONDARY NATIVE FORESTS, BEING THE LATTER THE LESS FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE HABITAT. FURTHER, SECONDARY FORESTS LACK NATURAL TREE CAVITIES, AND BIRDS NESTING THERE ARE MORE PRONE TO BE AFFECTED BY BROOD PARASITISM. CHANGES IN HABITAT STRUCTURE SEEM TO BE DETERMINANT FOR BIRD FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY ALONG A HABITAT DEGRADATION GRADIENT.

THE NORTH-WESTERN IONIAN SEA (CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN) EXPERIENCED LONG-STANDING TRAWL FISHING ACTIVITY WITH THE EXPLOITATION OF DEEP-SEA DEMERSAL RESOURCES. THE INTEGRATE ANALYSIS WITH DATA OF BOTH BENTHIC, DEMERSAL AND BENTHOPELAGIC SPECIES COLLECTED DURING A TIME SERIES OF EXPERIMENTAL TRAWL SURVEY, YEARLY CARRIED OUT IN THE IONIAN BASIN DOWN TO 800 M IN DEPTH, ALLOWED TO ASSES THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE IONIAN DEEP-SEA FAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES AND THEIR POTENTIAL CHANGES OVERTIME. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS AND UNIVARIATE INDICES, MODELLED USING GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODEL (GAM) FRAMEWORK, CONFIRM A DEPTH ZONATION PATTERN OF DEEP-SEA FAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES IN THE STUDY AREA, WITH THE PRESENCE OF TWO DISTINCT EPIBATHYAL AND MESOBATHYAL GROUPS. GAM ALSO HIGHLIGHTED A TEMPORAL EFFECT ON THE BIODIVERSITY INDICES, WITH SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE TRENDS OF DIVERSITY AND EVENNESS INDICES AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASING OF DOMINANCE ONE, OVER THE STUDY PERIOD 2012-2020. THE BENTHIC COMMUNITY IS CHARACTERISED BY MORE GENERALIST SPECIES AND A SIMPLIFIED STRUCTURE, WITH A SEVERE DEPLETION IN HABITAT-FORMER TAXA WHEREAS THE DEMERSAL AND BENTHOPELAGIC FAUNA OF THE IONIAN SEA SHOW A GENERAL STABILITY IN THE OVERALL STRUCTURE IF COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES LASTING OVER TWO DECADES.

ONE MAJOR THREAT IS AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, TYPICALLY CHARACTERISED BY LARGE AREAS OF MONOCULTURE, MECHANICAL TILLAGE, AND THE USE OF AGROCHEMICALS. INTENSIFICATION LEADS TO THE FRAGMENTATION AND LOSS OF NATURAL HABITATS, NATIVE VEGETATION, AND NESTING AND BREEDING SITES. UNDERSTANDING THE ADAPTABILITY OF INSECTS TO THESE CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IS CRITICAL TO PREDICTING THEIR SURVIVAL. BUMBLEBEES, KEY POLLINATORS OF WILD AND CULTIVATED PLANTS, ARE USED AS MODEL SPECIES TO ASSESS INSECT ADAPTATION TO ANTHROPOGENIC STRESSORS. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL PRESSURES ON TWO COMMON EUROPEAN BUMBLEBEES, BOMBUS PASCUORUM AND B. LAPIDARIUS. RESTRICTION-SITE ASSOCIATED DNA SEQUENCING WAS USED TO IDENTIFY LOCI UNDER SELECTIVE PRESSURE ACROSS AGRICULTURAL-NATURAL GRADIENTS OVER 97 LOCATIONS IN EUROPE. 191 UNIQUE LOCI IN B. PASCUORUM AND 260 IN B. LAPIDARIUS WERE IDENTIFIED AS UNDER SELECTIVE PRESSURE, AND ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURAL STRESSORS.

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THERE IS A LACK OF SYSTEMATIC, WIDESPREAD MAMMAL MONITORING, AND A RECOGNIZED DEFICIENCY OF DATA. INNOVATIVE NEW APPROACHES ARE REQUIRED. WE DEVELOPED MAMMALWEB, A PORTAL TO ENABLE UK-WIDE CAMERA TRAPPING BY A NETWORK OF CITIZEN SCIENTISTS AND PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. MAMMALWEB CITIZEN SCIENTISTS CONTRIBUTE TO BOTH THE COLLECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF CAMERA TRAP DATA. FOLLOWING TRIALS IN 2013–2017, MAMMALWEB HAS GROWN ORGANICALLY TO INCREASE ITS GEOGRAPHIC REACH (E.G. ∼2000 SITES IN BRITAIN). IT HAS SO FAR PROVIDED THE EQUIVALENT OF OVER 340 CAMERA TRAP-YEARS OF WILD MAMMAL MONITORING, AND PRODUCED NEARLY 440,000 CLASSIFIED IMAGE SEQUENCES AND VIDEOS, OF WHICH, OVER 180,000 ARE MAMMAL DETECTIONS. WE DESCRIBE MAMMALWEB, ITS BACKGROUND, ITS DEVELOPMENT AND THE NOVEL APPROACHES WE HAVE FOR PARTICIPATION. WE CONSIDER THE DATA COLLECTED BY MAMMALWEB PARTICIPANTS, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE MAIN GOALS OF WILDLIFE MONITORING: TO PROVIDE SPATIAL DATA, ABUNDANCE DATA AND TEMPORAL BEHAVIOURAL DATA. MAMMALWEB CAN COMPLEMENT EXISTING APPROACHES TO MAMMAL MONITORING. EXPLICIT ACCOUNTING FOR SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS IN ANIMAL ACTIVITY ENABLES ACCOUNTING OF BIAS RELATIVE TO AD HOC OBSERVATIONAL DATA. ESTIMATING ABUNDANCE PRESENTS CHALLENGES, AS FOR MANY CAMERA-TRAPPING STUDIES, BUT WE DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL OF THE DATA AS THEY STAND, AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVANCE THEIR VALUE FOR ABUNDANCE ESTIMATION. CHALLENGES REMAIN TO MAMMALWEB'S CENTRAL MISSIONS OF ENHANCING ENGAGEMENT WITH AND CONNECTION TO NATURE, AND DELIVERING POLICY-RELEVANT DATA ON BRITAIN'S WILD MAMMALS. WE DISCUSS THESE CHALLENGES AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THEY PROVIDE FOR ADVANCES IN RESPECT OF ENGAGEMENT, SCIENCE AND FINANCIAL SECURITY. OUR APPROACH REDUCES ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND INCREASES SPATIAL COVERAGE AND, AS SUCH, MAMMALWEB PROVIDES A USEFUL ADDITION TO EXISTING CASE STUDIES OF CITIZEN SCIENCE CAMERA-TRAPPING PROGRAM DESIGN. WE BELIEVE MAMMALWEB IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS FULFILLING CALLS FOR UK-WIDE MAMMAL MONITORING AND OUR DESCRIPTION OF CHALLENGES IDENTIFIES AN AGENDA FOR FULFILLING THAT PURPOSE. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

MAMMALWEB HAS DELIBERATELY REMAINED SMALL TO ENSURE AFFORDABILITY BUT, EVEN SO, THE FIXED ANNUAL COSTS FOR SERVERS, DATA STORAGE AND PLATFORM MAINTENANCE ARE IN THE ORDER OF USD 6000. THE COST OF PLATFORM IMPROVEMENTS IS HIGHER STILL, AND WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR THE TIME VOLUNTEERED TO THE PROJECT BY SCIENTISTS AND POLICYMAKERS. WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE IN ATTRACTING SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF SMALL, DIRECTED PROJECT GRANTS TO BE ABLE TO MEET OUR ANNUAL COSTS, HITHERTO. HOWEVER, THE FUNDING LANDSCAPE IS INHERENTLY UNSTABLE, AND LONG-TERM SECURITY WILL ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL MODEL. IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONJECTURE SEVERAL MODELS FOR SUSTAINABLE FINANCING OF CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECTS, WHICH ARE WORTH EXPLORING. A COMMON APPROACH AMONG NGOS IS A MEMBERSHIP MODEL, IN WHICH PARTICIPANTS CONTRIBUTE AN ANNUAL SUM TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF AN ORGANIZATION. AMONG ENVIRONMENTAL NGOS, THIS IS MOST COMMON FOR THOSE THAT TAKE DIRECT ACTION OR MANAGE LANDSCAPES FOR WILDLIFE PROTECTION. THE BRITISH TRUST FOR ORNITHOLOGY PRESENTS AN EXAMPLE OF A MEMBERSHIP-FUNDED ORGANIZATION WHOSE MAIN FOCUS IS ‘UNDERSTANDING BIRDS AND, IN PARTICULAR, HOW AND WHY BIRD POPULATIONS ARE CHANGING’ (BTO, 2010) AND THEY RUN SEVERAL MONITORING SCHEMES IN WHICH MEMBERS PAY FOR PARTICIPATION, SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A DETERRENT TO ENGAGEMENT. HOWEVER, THIS MIGHT BE PROBLEMATIC FOR THE WIDER PARTICIPATION THAT OUR PLATFORM IS DESIGNED TO FOSTER. ALTERNATIVELY, THE EMAMMAL PLATFORM CHARGES CAMERA TRAPPING PROJECTS—INSTEAD OF CITIZEN SCIENTISTS—FOR HOSTING THEIR DATA (HTTPS://EMAMMAL.SI.EDU/ABOUT/COSTS/); DOING SO FOR LARGER COLLABORATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD BE A VIABLE WAY TO FUND THE PLATFORM WITHOUT DETERRING WIDER PARTICIPATION. A SECOND POSSIBILITY TO DEFRAY THE FIXED COSTS OF THE PROJECT WOULD BE TO PARTNER WITH AN ORGANIZATION THAT ALREADY HOSTS ONLINE PLATFORMS AND SPECIALIZES IN ENGAGEMENT. TO SUCH ORGANIZATIONS, THE COST OF HOSTING MAMMALWEB WOULD LIKELY MAKE LESS DIFFERENCE TO THEIR RUNNING COSTS THAN MIGHT BE EXPECTED BASED ON OUR CURRENT RUNNING COSTS. TO DATE, OUR EXPLORATION OF THIS POSSIBILITY WITH TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAVE REVEALED TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS OR COMPATIBILITY ISSUES THAT REQUIRE UPFRONT INVESTMENT. NONETHELESS, BOTH AVENUES MERIT FURTHER INVESTIGATION. A THIRD POSSIBILITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH SPONSORSHIP. MAMMALWEB IS AN ONLINE FACILITY WITH THE POTENTIAL TO REACH LARGE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH QUITE DEFINED INTERESTS. THIS COULD BE OF INTEREST TO A COMMERCIAL SPONSOR OR ADVERTISING BY RELEVANT RETAILERS. FINALLY, THE UNITED KINGDOM IS OBLIGED BY THE BERN CONVENTION AND ASSOCIATED UK STATUTES TO ENSURE THE CONSERVATION OF WILD PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES, AND BY THE CONVENTION OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY TO PROVIDE BIODIVERSITY INDICATORS AS AGREED FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE CAN ONLY BE DEMONSTRATED WITH SOME DEGREE OF WILDLIFE MONITORING. EFFICIENT TOOLS TO SUPPORT THAT REQUIREMENT ARE LIKELY TO BE IMPORTANT BUT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER CORE FUNDING WILL BE ALLOCATED FOR THAT PURPOSE.

MANY OF THESE SERVICES ARE NOT FULLY-APPRECIATED DUE TO COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMICS AND LACK OF BASELINE DATA. MULTICONTINENTAL AMPHIBIAN DECLINE DUE TO THE FUNGAL PATHOGEN BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS (BD) PROVIDES A STARK EXAMPLE. EVEN THOUGH AMPHIBIANS ARE KNOWN TO AFFECT NATURAL FOOD WEBS—INCLUDING MOSQUITOES THAT TRANSMIT HUMAN DISEASES—THE HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS CONNECTED TO THEIR MASSIVE DECLINE HAVE RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION. HERE WE LEVERAGE A UNIQUE ENSEMBLE OF ECOLOGICAL SURVEYS, SATELLITE DATA, AND NEWLY DIGITIZED PUBLIC HEALTH RECORDS TO SHOW AN EMPIRICAL LINK BETWEEN A WAVE OF BD-DRIVEN COLLAPSE OF AMPHIBIANS IN COSTA RICA AND PANAMA AND INCREASED HUMAN MALARIA INCIDENCE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE ESTIMATED DATE OF BD-DRIVEN AMPHIBIAN DECLINE IN EACH ‘COUNTY’ (CANTON OR DISTRITO), WE FIND THAT MALARIA CASES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED FOR SEVERAL YEARS. FOR THE SIX YEAR PEAK OF THE ESTIMATED EFFECT, THE ANNUAL EXPECTED COUNTY-LEVEL INCREASE IN MALARIA RANGES FROM 0.76 TO 1.1 ADDITIONAL CASES PER 1000 POPULATION. THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE GIVEN THAT CASES COUNTRY-WIDE PER 1000 POPULATION PEAKED DURING THE TIMEFRAME OF OUR STUDY AT APPROXIMATELY 1.5 FOR COSTA RICA AND 1.1 FOR PANAMA. THIS PREVIOUSLY UNIDENTIFIED IMPACT OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS ILLUSTRATES THE OFTEN HIDDEN HUMAN WELFARE COSTS OF CONSERVATION FAILURES.

AN ALTERNATIVE TO IDENTIFY RISK-PRONE POPULATIONS IS TO USE INDICATORS INFORMING ON THEIR GENERAL HEALTH (I.E., THEIR GENERAL FITNESS AND ABILITY TO COPE WITH CHANGING ENVIRONMENT) BASED ON SIMPLE AND COMPLEMENTARY PARAMETERS ESTIMATED FROM SNAPSHOT SAMPLING. HOWEVER, MOST STUDIES ON WILDLIFE POPULATION HEALTH FOCUS ON ONE OR ONLY A FEW PARAMETERS, YIELDING POTENTIALLY BIASED CONCLUSIONS FOR CONSERVATION. HERE, WE DEVELOPED A MULTIFACETED INDEX OF POPULATION HEALTH BY COMBINING 3 COMPLEMENTARY INDICATORS, NAMELY PATHOLOGICAL, ECOLOGICAL, AND GENETIC INDICATORS, BASED ON AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH TRADITIONALLY USED TO ASSESS ECOSYSTEM MULTIFUNCTIONALITY. WE INVESTIGATED THEIR COMPLEMENTARITY AND RELEVANCE FOR DETECTING BROWN TROUT (SALMO TRUTTA) RISK-PRONE POPULATIONS AT A LARGE SPATIAL SCALE, AND THE UNDERLYING ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS. THE MULTIFACETED HEALTH INDEX PROPERLY REPRESENTED THE INDIVIDUAL INDICATORS' COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. IT IDENTIFIED A CLUSTER OF MODERATELY RISK-PRONE POPULATIONS AND RAISED THE ALARM FOR ONE POPULATION. EACH INDICATOR WAS INDIVIDUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH DISTINCT ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS RELEVANT FOR BROWN TROUT REQUIREMENTS. THE MULTIFACETED HEALTH INDEX HIGHLIGHTED SURROUNDING AGRICULTURAL LAND AND OXYGEN CONCENTRATION AS THE MOST IMPACTING ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS FOR THE GENERAL HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY OF BROWN TROUT POPULATIONS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH INTEGRATIVE INDEX CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO A WIDE RANGE OF SPECIES AND CONTEXTS.

WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT DROUGHT WILL SLOW THE DECOMPOSITION OF LITTER MIXTURES DUE TO A DECLINE IN COMPLEMENTARY RESOURCE USE. THE PRESENCE OF SOIL FAUNA COULD FAVOR LITTER DECOMPOSITION AND MITIGATE THE DROUGHT EFFECT, BUT THIS DEPENDS ON SOIL NITROGEN (N) AVAILABILITY TO SOIL FAUNA. TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES, WE COMPARED THE DECOMPOSITION OF SINGLE AND ALL POSSIBLE LITTER MIXTURES (11) OF FOUR LEAF LITTER TYPES IN LITTERBAGS WITH THREE MESH SIZES (I.E., 0.05-MM, 1-MM, AND 5-MM) IN CONTROL AND TREATMENT PLOTS (DROUGHT, N ADDITION OR BOTH) IN AN N-ENRICHED BAMBOO FOREST ECOSYSTEM. INCREASING THE LITTER SPECIES RICHNESS MODERATELY ACCELERATED LITTER CARBON (C) AND N LOSS. THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF LITTER DIVERSITY ON DECOMPOSITION WAS DUE TO MORE COMPLEMENTARY RESOURCE USE. BOTH DROUGHT AND N ADDITION SLOWED THE C AND N LOSS FROM DIVERSE LITTER MIXTURES, AND N ADDITION EXACERBATED THE NEGATIVE DROUGHT EFFECT IN THIS N-ENRICHED FOREST. THESE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ABIOTIC MANIPULATION ON LITTER DECOMPOSITION WERE PARTLY ATTRIBUTED TO LESS COMPLEMENTARY RESOURCE USE. SPECIFICALLY, THE COMPLEMENTARITY EFFECTS OF LITTER MIXING ON C LOSS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY, BY 50%, WITH DROUGHT, AND WAS EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE DROUGHT AND N ADDITION TREANTMENT. THE THREE-WAY INTERACTIONS AMONG DROUGHT, N ADDITION, AND DECOMPOSER COMMUNITIES DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PRESENCE OF SOIL FAUNA SUPPORTS COMPLEMENTARY RESOURCE USE AND ALLEVIATES THEDROUGHT CONSTRAINT, BUT NOT THE RESTRICTION IN DECOMPOSITION CAUSED BY N ADDITION IN THIS N-ENRICHED FOREST. THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR PROJECTED DECOMPOSITION RATES UNDER FUTURE GLOBAL CHANGE SCENARIOS, SINCE THEY SUGGEST THAT ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AFFECT DECOMPOSITION THROUGH DIRECT EFFECTS ON SOIL BIOTA AND INDIRECT IMPACTS ON WITHIN- AND AMONG-TROPHIC INTERACTIONS IN FOREST ECOSYSTEMS. © 2022 ELSEVIER LTD",108783,NA,SBIOA,"LUAN, J.; INSTITUTE OF RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT, CHINA; EMAIL: JUNWEILUAN@ICBR.AC.CN; LIU, S.; KEY LABORATORY OF FOREST ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT OF NATIONAL FORESTRY AND GRASSLAND ADMINISTRATION, CHINA; EMAIL: LIUSR@CAF.AC.CN",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108783,"1632019006, 1632021023 NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA, NSFC, 31971461 NATIONAL KEY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF CHINANATIONAL KEY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF CHINA, NKRDPC, 2021YFD2200405",380717,SOIL BIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,ELSEVIER LTD,NA,SCOPUS,DECOMPOSITION OF DIVERSE LITTER MIXTURES AFFECTED BY DROUGHT DEPENDS ON NITROGEN AND SOIL FAUNA IN A BAMBOO FOREST,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136592008&doi=10.1016%2fj.soilbio.2022.108783&partnerID=40&md5=e829574178586f6d82067d9cf1b836e8,173,2022,"THIS STUDY WAS JOINTLY FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL KEY R&D PROGRAM OF CHINA ( 2021YFD2200405 ), THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (NO. 31971461 ), AND THE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR BAMBOO AND RATTAN ( 1632021023 , 1632019006 ).

THIS HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE USE OF BIOINDICATORS IN LAND MANAGEMENT. WE EVALUATED THE LOCAL-SCALE RESPONSES OF MULTIPLE FAUNAL TAXA TO LAND-USE CHANGE IN THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO MEASURING DIFFERENT ASPECTS (TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL) AND LEVELS (ALPHA AND BETA) OF DIVERSITY. WE COMPARED ANT, DUNG BEETLE AND BIRD ASSEMBLAGES INHABITING REMNANTS OF NATURAL HABITAT (SAVANNA AND SEMI-DECIDUOUS FOREST) WITH THOSE FOUND IN CATTLE PASTURES, SOY FIELDS OR EUCALYPTUS PLANTATIONS. SPECIES RICHNESS WAS MARKEDLY HIGHER IN NATURAL HABITATS FOR ANTS AND BIRDS BUT NOT FOR DUNG BEETLES. EFFECTS ON FUNCTIONAL ALPHA DIVERSITY WERE TAXON SPECIFIC AND THERE WAS NOT SUCH A CONTRAST BETWEEN NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC HABITATS. PATTERNS OF FUNCTIONAL BETA DIVERSITY WERE CORRELATED WITH PATTERNS OF TAXONOMIC BETA DIVERSITY AND WERE ALSO TAXON SPECIFIC. FOR DUNG BEETLES, SITE-TO-SITE VARIATION IN TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION WAS GREATEST IN FORESTS, WHEREAS BIRDS TENDED TO PRESENT GREATER SPATIAL TURNOVER AND ANTS GREATER NESTEDENESS IN THE ANTHROPOGENIC THAN IN THE NATURAL HABITATS. AMONG THE THREE ANTHROPOGENIC LAND USES, TREE PLANTATIONS PRESENTED THE MOST SIMILAR COMPOSITION TO NATURAL HABITAT FOR ALL TAXA. OVERALL, SIMILARITY IN TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION BETWEEN NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC HABITATS WAS GREATER FOR SAVANNA THAN FOREST. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THE RESPONSES OF ANT, DUNG BEETLE AND BIRD ASSEMBLAGES TO LAND-USE CHANGE IN THE CERRADO WERE HIGHLY VARIABLE. NONETHELESS, RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE EXTENT OF IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY REFLECTS THE EXTENT OF HABITAT TRANSFORMATION AND THAT IMPACTS AT A LANDSCAPE SCALE MAY BE REDUCED BY A MIX OF LAND USES. WE SHOWED THAT EFFECTS WERE MORE SEVERE FROM A TAXONOMIC THAN FROM A FUNCTIONAL PERSPECTIVE, FOR THE FOREST THAN FOR THE SAVANNA-ASSOCIATED FAUNA, FOR THE ANT AND BIRD THAN FOR THE DUNG BEETLE FAUNA, AND OFTEN IN LANDS DEVOTED TO INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE RATHER THAN TO PASTORALISM OR PLANTATION FORESTRY.

RESEARCH ON HOW LAND-USE CHANGE CONTRIBUTES TO A LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY IS URGENTLY NEEDED, ESPECIALLY IN ECOSYSTEMS THAT HAVE UNDERGONE RAPID ANTHROPOGENIC CHANGES. WE SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH HABITAT LOSS, FRAGMENTATION, AND HABITAT SPLIT (THE SEPARATION OF FOREST AND AQUATIC HABITATS) NEGATIVELY INFLUENCED TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY, FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY, TOTAL ABUNDANCE, AND THE INDIVIDUAL ABUNDANCES OF FIVE ANURAN SPECIES IN THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO. WE SAMPLED ANURANS BETWEEN DECEMBER 2017 AND MARCH 2018 USING PITFALL TRAPS AT SITES DISTRIBUTED ALONG A GRADIENT OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION/HABITAT SPLIT: UNFRAGMENTED FOREST, FOREST FRAGMENTS WITHOUT HABITAT SPLIT, AND FOREST FRAGMENTS WITH HABITAT SPLIT. FOREST COVER WAS MEASURED WITHIN A 1-KM RADIUS OF EACH SITE. SITES WITHIN UNFRAGMENTED FORESTS HAD HIGHER TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITIES THAN EITHER FRAGMENT TYPE. TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY WAS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY, BUT WE DID NOT FIND A PATTERN TO THE LOSS OF FUNCTIONAL TRAITS. TOTAL ANURAN ABUNDANCE AND THE ABUNDANCES OF CHIASMOCLEIS ALBOPUNCTATA, PHYSALAEMUS CUVIERI, AND RHINELLA DIPTYCHA WERE HIGHER IN UNFRAGMENTED FORESTS COMPARED TO FOREST FRAGMENTS. NO SPECIES WAS MORE ABUNDANT IN FRAGMENTS THAN IN UNFRAGMENTED FORESTS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE FRAGMENTATION OF FORESTS BY AGRICULTURAL LAND USE IS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OF TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY, AS WELL AS FOR REDUCING POPULATION SIZES OF GROUND-DWELLING ANURANS.

THE ECTOTHERMIC NATURE OF AMPHIBIANS MAY MAKE THEM PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION REGIMES, ADDING TO DECLINES FROM OTHER THREATS. WHILE ACTIVE SEASON ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CAN INFLUENCE GROWTH AND SURVIVAL, EFFECTS OF VARIATION IN WINTER CONDITIONS ON POPULATION DYNAMICS ARE LESS WELL-STUDIED. GIVEN THAT EXTREME WINTER TEMPERATURES CAN INFLUENCE AMPHIBIAN SURVIVAL AND FITNESS, WE EXPECTED THAT INCREASED WINTER SEVERITY—AS MEASURED BY VARIABILITY IN WINTER TEMPERATURES AND SNOW COVER—WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED OCCUPANCY, AND THAT POPULATIONS THAT EXPERIENCE MORE SEVERE WINTERS WOULD HAVE THE LARGEST SENSITIVITIES AND SHOW THE GREATEST DECLINES. LOCATION: EASTERN UNITED STATES. TIME PERIOD: 2001–2015. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: ANURANS. METHODS: WE USED LARGE-SCALE CITIZEN SCIENCE DATA FROM THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES, A DIVERSE BIOGEOGRAPHIC AND CLIMATIC REGION, TO ASSESS HOW VARIATION IN WINTER SEVERITY INFLUENCED OCCUPANCY DYNAMICS (I.E. PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF SPECIES ACROSS SITES AND YEARS) OF 11 SPRING AND SUMMER BREEDING ANURAN SPECIES. RESULTS: MOST SPECIES HAD INCREASED OCCUPANCY IN YEARS WITH GREATER THAN AVERAGE SNOW COVER AND WARMER THAN AVERAGE MEAN WINTER TEMPERATURES. SURPRISINGLY, CLIMATIC CONDITIONS IN WINTER AFFECTED OCCUPANCY DYNAMICS OF SPECIES WITH VARYING LIFE HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING BOTH SPRING AND SUMMER BREEDING SPECIES, THOSE THAT OVERWINTER UNDER THE SOIL, AND THOSE THAT OVERWINTER IN PONDS AND STREAM BEDS. FOR TWO WIDE-RANGING SPECIES (LITHOBATES CATESBEIANUS AND LITHOBATES CLAMITANS), COLDER WINTER TEMPERATURES REDUCED OCCUPANCY MORE AT NORTHERN LATITUDES, WHILE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DAYS OF SNOW COVER AND LATITUDE WAS EQUIVOCAL. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: AS THE CLIMATE CONTINUES TO CHANGE, EXPECTED REDUCTIONS IN SNOWPACK MAY REDUCE OCCUPANCY OF ALREADY DECLINING ANURAN POPULATIONS, WHILE MILDER WINTERS MAY IMPROVE OVERWINTER SURVIVAL FOR SOME SPECIES. THE CONTRADICTORY IMPACTS OF TEMPERATURE AND SNOW COVER ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING MULTI-DIMENSIONAL IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON ANURAN POPULATIONS. PUBLISHED 2022.

J. PRIMATOL.,1,"WITH THE ONGOING GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY CRISIS IN THE ANTHROPOCENE, IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO SAVE ENDANGERED SPECIES TO “BEND THE CURVE” OF BIODIVERSITY DECLINE. THE HAINAN GIBBON (NOMASCUS HAINANUS) IS A CRITICALLY ENDANGERED SPECIES THAT IS ENDEMIC TO HAINAN ISLAND. WE PERFORMED TWO SYNCHRONIZED TOTAL COUNT SURVEYS IN HAINAN TROPIC RAIN FOREST NATIONAL PARK IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER OF 2020 AND 2021 BY LOCATING GIBBON GROUPS FROM THEIR MORNING CALLS AND CONDUCTING DETAILED COUNTS IN ALL POTENTIAL HABITAT FRAGMENTS. WE COMPARED OUR FINDINGS WITH EXISTING DATA TO MODEL THE POPULATION TREND, AND ANALYZED THE POTENTIAL AND REALIZED REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIALS. WE FOUND 5 GROUPS WITH A TOTAL OF 33 GIBBONS IN 2020 AND 35 IN 2021, INCLUDING 4 AND 6 SOLITARY INDIVIDUALS RESPECTIVELY. THIS IS AN INCREASE OF 169% SINCE 2003, WHEN THERE WERE 13 INDIVIDUALS WITH 2 GROUPS AND 2 SOLITARY INDIVIDUALS. LOGISTIC AND LINEAR CURVES FITTED THE 2003-2021 POPULATION CENSUS DATA EQUALLY WELL.

HOWEVER, ACQUIRING DATA ON ALL INDICATORS AND ESTIMATING CRITERIA ACCORDING TO ESTABLISHED DEFINITIONS CAN BE CHALLENGING. HERE, WE DEVELOPED AN INTEGRATED POPULATION MODEL (IPM) AND POPULATION VIABILITY ANALYSIS (PVA) FRAMEWORK TO ESTIMATE ALL DEMOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS AND CRITERIA FOR A REINTRODUCED POPULATION OF CRESTED IBIS NIPPONIA NIPPON, AND TO PROJECT POPULATION DYNAMICS UNDER A RANGE OF RELEASE SCENARIOS ON SADO ISLAND, JAPAN. OUR IPM-PVA FRAMEWORK INTEGRATED ROOST COUNT AND MARK–RESIGHT DATA FOR 415 RELEASED AND 203 WILD-HATCHED INDIVIDUALS, AS WELL AS REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE FOR A TOTAL OF 575 PAIRS. WE AIMED TO ASSESS SURVIVAL, REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, POPULATION SIZE, NUMBER OF MATURE INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATION PROJECTION. IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER RELEASE, THE ESTIMATED APPARENT ANNUAL SURVIVAL RATE WAS 0.566 [BAYESIAN CREDIBLE INTERVALS (CRI) 0.518–0.614]; HOWEVER, THIS RATE INCREASED AFTER 1 YEAR (0.865; CRI 0.836–0.892). WILD-HATCHED JUVENILES EXHIBITED A HIGH SURVIVAL RATE (0.757; CRI 0.670–0.838) THAT WAS JUST LOWER THAN THAT OF ADULTS (0.899; CRI 0.844–0.949). THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS RATE VARIED WITH PAIR ATTRIBUTES (RELEASED–RELEASED PAIR: 0.245, CRI 0.194–0.299; RELEASED–WILD PAIR: 0.377, CRI 0.281–0.471; WILD–WILD PAIR: 0.350, CRI 0.237–0.471).

INT.,1,"DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND HABITAT CONVERSION, ESTIMATES OF THE RESULTING LEVELS OF SPECIES EXTINCTION OVER THE NEXT CENTURY ARE ALARMING. DEVISING CONSERVATION SOLUTIONS WILL REQUIRE MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES, INCLUDING EXAMINING THE EXTINCTION PROCESSES OF RECENTLY EXTINCT SPECIES. GIVEN THAT PARROTS ARE ONE OF THE MOST THREATENED GROUPS OF BIRDS, INFORMATION REGARDING PARROT EXTINCTION IS PRESSING. WHILE MOST RECENT PARROT EXTINCTIONS HAVE BEEN ISLAND ENDEMICS, THE CAROLINA PARAKEET CONUROPSIS CAROLINENSIS HAD AN 18TH-CENTURY RANGE COVERING NEARLY HALF OF THE PRESENT-DAY UNITED STATES, YET MOSTLY DISAPPEARED BY THE END OF THE 19TH CENTURY. DESPITE A GREAT DEAL OF SPECULATION, THE MAJOR CAUSE OF ITS EXTINCTION REMAINS UNKNOWN. ESTABLISHING THE DATE WHEN A SPECIES WENT EXTINCT IS ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS IN DETERMINING WHAT CAUSED THEIR EXTINCTION. WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN ESTIMATES OF THEIR EXTINCTION DATE, THESE ANALYSES USED A LIMITED DATASET AND DID NOT INCLUDE OBSERVATIONAL DATA. WE USED A RECENTLY PUBLISHED, EXTENSIVE DATASET OF CAROLINA PARAKEET SPECIMENS AND OBSERVATIONS COMBINED WITH A BAYESIAN EXTINCTION ESTIMATING MODEL TO DETERMINE THE MOST LIKELY EXTINCTION DATES. BY CONSIDERING EACH OF THE TWO SUBSPECIES INDEPENDENTLY, WE FOUND THAT THEY WENT EXTINCT 30 YEARS APART: THE WESTERN SUBSPECIES C. C. LUDOVICIANUS GOING EXTINCT AROUND 1914 AND THE EASTERN SUBSPECIES C. C. CAROLINENSIS EITHER IN THE LATE 1930S OR MID-1940S. HAD WE ONLY CONSIDERED ALL OBSERVATIONS TOGETHER, THIS PATTERN WOULD HAVE BEEN OBSCURED, POSSIBLY MISSING A MAJOR CLUE IN SOLVING THE MYSTERY OF THE PARAKEET'S EXTINCTION. SINCE THE CAROLINA PARAKEET WAS A WIDE-RANGING SPECIES THAT WENT EXTINCT DURING A PERIOD OF RAPID AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION, CONDITIONS THAT MIRROR THOSE OCCURRING IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE PARROT DIVERSITY IS HIGHEST, ANY PROGRESS WE MAKE IN UNRAVELING THE MYSTERY OF THEIR DISAPPEARANCE MAY BE VITAL TO MODERN CONSERVATION EFFORTS. ©",NA,NA,NA,"BURGIO, K.R.; DEPARTMENT OF ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, 75 N.

THIS HAS HAD MEASURABLE IMPACTS ON FRESHWATER SPECIES, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY ON FRESHWATER FISHES, AS DATA FROM THE RED LIST SHOW THAT 23.5% OF THE 11,937 FRESHWATER FISH SPECIES EVALUATED SO FAR, ARE CLASSIFIED AS THREATENED. MEXICO IS NOT EXEMPT FROM THIS SITUATION, AS A RECENT REPORT DEMONSTRATES THAT 39.9% OF MEXICAN FRESHWATER FISHES ARE THREATENED, AND THERE ARE 21 LOST SPECIES (EXTINCT + EXTINCT IN THE WILD), THE HIGHEST NUMBER FOR ANY COUNTRY OR REGION OF THE WORLD. HERE WE DEVELOP A THEORY OF CHANGE (TOC) TO GUIDE MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS WHEN SEEKING TO PREVENT FURTHER FRESHWATER FISH EXTINCTIONS IN MEXICO AND REVERSING THE CURRENT EXTINCTION CRISIS. WE DESCRIBE FOUR THEMATIC AREAS OF INTERVENTION: (1) RESTORATION AND REINTRODUCTION AIMED AT EIGHT EXTINCT IN THE WILD AND FOUR REGIONALLY EXTINCT SPECIES, (2) CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT PRIORITIZING 39 CRITICALLY ENDANGERED SPECIES, DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THOSE INHABITING PROTECTED AREAS, WATER PARKS, AND THOSE WITH NO MANAGEMENT NOR PROTECTION, (3) EXPLORATIONS TO FIND EIGHT POSSIBLY EXTINCT SPECIES, AND (4) COMMUNICATION AND OUTREACH TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR CONSERVATION INTERVENTIONS.

ORGANIC FARMING IS OFTEN CONSIDERED A MORE ECOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVE SINCE IT GENERALLY HOSTS GREATER FAUNAL DIVERSITY. TO DATE, THE IMPACT OF CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURE ON THE DECLINE IN AVIAN SPECIES HAS MAINLY BEEN ASSESSED THROUGH THE LENS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS; FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL FARMING ON INDIVIDUAL LIFE-HISTORY TRAIT COMPONENTS. BEHAVIOUR REPRESENTS THE FINAL INTEGRATED OUTCOME OF A RANGE OF BIOCHEMICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS AND CAN BE CONSIDERED A PROXY OF HEALTH AS IT IS MORE SENSITIVE THAN OTHER LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS, POTENTIALLY ALLOWING ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES TO BE BETTER TRACKED. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND HOW EXPOSURE TO CONVENTIONAL VERSUS ORGANIC FARMING AFFECTS THE BEHAVIOUR OF PASSERINE BIRDS IN REAL CONDITIONS. BY SAMPLING 6 SPECIES OF PASSERINE BIRDS IN 10 HEDGEROWS IN ORGANIC LANDSCAPES AND 10 HEDGEROWS IN CONVENTIONAL LANDSCAPES DURING THE BREEDING PERIOD, WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT ORGANIC FARMING SHARPLY INCREASED THE VITALITY OF INDIVIDUALS, IRRESPECTIVE OF SPECIES. THIS WAS MEASURED THROUGH BEHAVIOUR SUCH AS FLEE ATTEMPTS, AGGRESSIVITY, PECKING AND DISTRESS CALLS WHEN CAPTURED, ALL OF WHICH WERE HIGHER IN BIRDS CAUGHT IN ORGANIC HEDGES THAN THOSE CAUGHT IN CONVENTIONAL LANDSCAPES. WE POSIT THAT PASSERINES LIVING IN ORGANICALLY FARMED LANDSCAPES BENEFIT FROM REDUCED PESTICIDE EXPOSURE RATHER THAN A GREATER ABUNDANCE OF FOOD, AS BODY CONDITION WAS IDENTICAL IN THE TWO CONTEXTS. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE BEHAVIOUR OF PASSERINES CAN BE A USEFUL INDICATOR OF THE STATE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND CAN THUS SERVE AS AN EARLY WARNING OF SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS.

SHARKS, RAYS, AND CHIMAERAS ARE FACING A BIODIVERSITY CRISIS WITH AN ESTIMATED 37% OF SPECIES THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION DRIVEN BY OVERFISHING. YET SPATIAL PLANNING TOOLS OFTEN FAIL TO CONSIDER THE HABITAT NEEDS CRITICAL FOR THEIR SURVIVAL. THE IMPORTANT SHARK AND RAY AREA (ISRA) APPROACH IS PROPOSED AS A RESPONSE TO THE DIRE GLOBAL STATUS OF SHARKS, RAYS, AND CHIMAERAS. A SET OF FOUR GLOBALLY STANDARDIZED SCIENTIFIC CRITERIA, WITH SEVEN SUB-CRITERIA, WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON INPUT COLLATED DURING FOUR SHARK, BIODIVERSITY, AND POLICY EXPERT WORKSHOPS CONDUCTED IN 2022. THE ISRA CRITERIA PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY DISCRETE, THREE-DIMENSIONAL PORTIONS OF HABITAT IMPORTANT FOR ONE OR MORE SHARK, RAY, OR CHIMAERA SPECIES, THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE DELINEATED AND MANAGED FOR CONSERVATION. THE ISRA CRITERIA CAN BE APPLIED TO ALL ENVIRONMENTS WHERE SHARKS OCCUR (MARINE, ESTUARINE, AND FRESHWATER) AND CONSIDER THE DIVERSITY OF SPECIES, THEIR COMPLEX BEHAVIORS AND ECOLOGY, AND BIOLOGICAL NEEDS. THE IDENTIFICATION OF ISRAS WILL GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT, DESIGN, AND APPLICATION OF AREA-BASED CONSERVATION INITIATIVES FOR SHARKS, RAYS, AND CHIMAERAS, AND CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR RECOVERY.

FLOODPLAINS WITH PERMANENT, EITHER ONE- OR TWO-SIDED LATERAL CONNECTIVITY TO THE MAIN CHANNEL, FAVOUR TOTAL FISH ABUNDANCE, AND ARE ESSENTIAL AS NURSERY AREAS FOR RIVERINE FISHES. HABITAT HETEROGENEITY HAD A STRONG POSITIVE EFFECT ON SPECIES RICHNESS BUT WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED WITH FISH ABUNDANCES. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES VARIED BETWEEN ECOLOGICAL GROUPS AND SPATIAL SCALES. SURPRISINGLY, RICHNESS OF CRITICAL RHEOPHILIC FISHES DECLINED WITH LARGE-SCALE HABITAT HETEROGENEITY (~1000 M), WHILE IT INCREASED AT SMALL SCALES (~100 M), POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF UNFAVOURABLE HABITATS FOR THIS ECOLOGICAL GROUP AT LARGER SCALES. CLEARLY, THERE IS NO ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL DESIGN FOR RIVER RESTORATION PROJECTS. WHETHER A RIVER SECTION IS FREE-FLOWING OR IMPOUNDED DICTATES THE SCOPE AND EFFICACY OF RESTORATION PROJECTS AND, WITHIN A RIVER SECTION, MULTIPLE COMPLEMENTARY RESTORATION PROJECTS MIGHT BE KEY TO MITIGATE FRESHWATER FISH BIODIVERSITY LOSS.

IN 2021, CHINA’S GIANT PANDA NATIONAL PARK (GPNP, 27,134 KM2) WAS ESTABLISHED IN ONE OF THE GLOBAL ENDEMISM HOTSPOTS. IN THIS STUDY WE ASK THE QUESTION WHETHER THIS LARGE NATIONAL PARK IS ABLE TO CONSERVE THE MANY THREATENED ENDEMIC VERTEBRATES OCCURRING IN THE REGION IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE AND LAND-USE CHANGES, IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE LONG-TERM EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GPNP. WE USED SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELING TECHNIQUES TO PROJECT THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF 40 THREATENED TERRESTRIAL (AND FRESHWATER) ENDEMIC VERTEBRATES UNDER LAND-USE AND CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0 AND SSP5–8.5 IN 2081–2100, AND ASSESSED THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS ARE COVERED BY THE GPNP, NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. WE FOUND THAT BY 2081–2100, TWO THIRDS OF THE THREATENED ENDEMIC VERTEBRATES ARE PREDICTED TO LOSE PART (15–79%, N = 4) OF OR (NEARLY) THEIR ENTIRE (80–100% LOSS, N = 23) RANGE UNDER ALL THREE CLIMATE AND LAND-USE CHANGE SCENARIOS. CONSEQUENTLY, FEWER SPECIES ARE PREDICTED TO OCCUR IN THE GPNP THAN AT PRESENT. OUR FINDINGS CONFIRM THE HIGH VULNERABILITY OF THREATENED ENDEMIC SPECIES TO CLIMATE AND LAND-USE CHANGES, DESPITE PROTECTED AREAS. HABITAT LOSS DUE TO CLIMATE AND LAND-USE CHANGES ELEVATE EXTINCTION RISK OF SPECIES IN ENDEMISM HOTSPOTS ACROSS THE GLOBE.

ALTHOUGH SPECIES LOSS HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED IN URBAN HABITATS, WHY SOME SPECIES PERSIST AND NOT OTHERS, AND HOW SPECIES INTERACTIONS CHANGE REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD, ESPECIALLY FOR SPECIES WITH SPECIALIZED NICHE REQUIREMENTS. HERE, WE TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT URBANIZATION DISRUPTS SPECIALIZED PLANT–HERBIVORE INTERACTIONS, AND THESE EFFECTS VARY ACCORDING TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH CITIES AND THE FEATURES OF THE ORGANISMS THEMSELVES. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE SURVEYED MILKWEED SPECIALIST HERBIVORE COMMUNITIES IN THE EARLY AND LATE GROWING SEASON OF THE COMMON MILKWEED (ASCLEPIAS SYRIACA) ACROSS SIX CITIES THAT VARIED IN SIZE BY TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. FOUR RESULTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO ANSWERING OUR RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) THE ABUNDANCE OF HERBIVORE SPECIES WAS HIGHER IN URBAN THAN IN RURAL HABITATS, WHEREAS LEAF HERBIVORY WAS HIGHER IN RURAL THAN IN URBAN HABITATS, AND THESE EFFECTS VARIED BETWEEN SEASONS AND AMONG CITIES; (2) THE HIGHER SPECIES DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE ARE LIKELY DUE TO A FEW SPECIES BEING MORE ASSOCIATED WITH RURAL HABITATS AND OTHER SPECIES MORE COMMON IN URBAN HABITATS, AND THUS, URBANIZATION ALTERS INSECT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; (3) THE SPECIES WITH THE LOWEST DISPERSAL ABILITIES, RHYSSOMATUS LINEATICOLLIS AND LIRIOMYZA ASCLEPIADIS, WERE THOSE THAT WERE MOST STRONGLY AFFECTED BY URBANIZATION, WITH R. LINEATICOLLIS LESS ABUNDANT AND L.

GENETIC APPROACHES ARE APPEALING GIVEN THE RELATIVE EASE OF FIELD SAMPLING REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE GENETIC DIVERSITY CHARACTERISTICS ASSUMED RELATED TO POPULATION SIZE, EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL, AND EXTINCTION RISK, AND TO EVALUATE HYBRIDIZATION WITH NON-NATIVE SPECIES SIMULTANEOUSLY. HOWEVER, LINKAGES BETWEEN POPULATION GENETIC METRICS OF DIVERSITY FROM SURVEY-STYLE FIELD COLLECTIONS AND DEMOGRAPHIC ESTIMATES OF POPULATION SIZE AND EXTINCTION RISK ARE STILL IN NEED OF EMPIRICAL EXAMPLES, ESPECIALLY FOR REMOTELY DISTRIBUTED SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN WHERE THE APPROACH MIGHT BE MOST BENEFICIAL. WE CAPITALIZED ON AN EXCEPTIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE CONGRUENCE BETWEEN GENETIC DIVERSITY METRICS AND DEMOGRAPHIC-BASED ESTIMATES OF ABUNDANCE AND EXTINCTION RISK FROM A COMPREHENSIVE MULTIPLE POPULATION VIABILITY ANALYSIS (MPVA) IN A THREATENED FISH, THE LAHONTAN CUTTHROAT TROUT (LCT). WE SEQUENCED NON-NATIVE TROUT REFERENCE SAMPLES AND RECENTLY COLLECTED AND ARCHIVED TISSUE SAMPLES OF MOST REMAINING POPULATIONS OF LCT (N = 60) AND ESTIMATED COMMON GENETIC ASSESSMENT METRICS, PREDICTING MINIMAL HYBRIDIZATION WITH NON-NATIVE TROUT, LOW DIVERSITY, AND DECLINING DIVERSITY OVER TIME. WE FURTHER HYPOTHESIZED GENETIC METRICS WOULD CORRELATE POSITIVELY WITH MPVA-ESTIMATED ABUNDANCE AND NEGATIVELY WITH EXTINCTION PROBABILITY. WE UNCOVERED SEVERAL INSTANCES OF HYBRIDIZATION THAT POINTED TO IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT NEEDS. AFTER REMOVING HYBRIDIZED INDIVIDUALS, CAUTIOUS INTERPRETATION OF LOW EFFECTIVE POPULATION SIZES (2–63) SUGGESTED REDUCED EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL FOR MANY LCT POPULATIONS. OTHER GENETIC METRICS DID NOT DECLINE OVER TIME NOR CORRELATE WITH MPVA-BASED ESTIMATES OF HARMONIC MEAN ABUNDANCE OR 30-YEAR EXTINCTION PROBABILITY. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE BENEFITS OF GENETIC MONITORING FOR EFFICIENTLY DETECTING HYBRIDIZATION AND, THOUGH GENETIC RESULTS WERE DISCONNECTED FROM DEMOGRAPHIC ASSESSMENT OF CONSERVATION STATUS, THEY SUGGEST REDUCED EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL AND LIKELY A HIGHER CONSERVATION RISK THAN CURRENTLY RECOGNIZED FOR THIS THREATENED FISH.

HERE, WE CONDUCTED A LARGE-SCALE FIELD EXPERIMENT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE REAL DIMENSION OF THE ILLEGAL WILDLIFE POISONING IN TERMS OF COMPOSITION AND NUMBER OF SPECIES AND ABUNDANCE OF IMPACTED INDIVIDUALS, AS WELL AS THE ECOLOGICAL FACTORS DRIVING IT. WE USED CAMERA TRAPS TO MONITOR SIMULATED POISON BAITS PLACED IN 25 STUDY AREAS IN SW EUROPE AND APPLIED GOOD–TURING THEORY TO ESTIMATE THE RICHNESS OF SPECIES OF THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLAGE (OBSERVED PLUS UNDETECTED). WE RECORDED 3095 INDIVIDUALS FROM 39 VERTEBRATE SPECIES THAT CONSUMED 94 % OF THE BAITS (N = 590). YET, USING SAMPLE COMPLETENESS TO ESTIMATE THE ENTIRE SPECIES ASSEMBLAGE YIELDED A TOTAL OF 47 SPECIES EXPOSED TO ILLEGAL POISONING. THE OBSERVED ASSEMBLAGE INCLUDED DIFFERENT TROPHIC AND FUNCTIONAL GROUPS (FROM LIZARDS AND SNAKES TO APEX SPECIES AMONG BIRDS AND MAMMALS), AS WELL AS A 38 % OF THREATENED AND NEAR THREATENED SPECIES (ACCORDING TO SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE VERTEBRATE RED LIST AND UICN LIST). THE SIZE (WEIGHT) OF THE BAIT OUTSTANDS AS A RELIABLE PREDICTOR OF THE NUMBER OF SPECIES (0–8 SPECIES/BAIT, MEAN = 2) AND INDIVIDUALS (0–99 INDIVIDUALS/BAIT, MEAN = 5) SUSCEPTIBLE TO POISONING. THE HABITAT WHERE THE BAIT WAS PLACED MODULATED THE ABUNDANCE OF INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED (GREATER IN OPEN THAN IN CLOSED HABITATS). TYPE OF BAIT AND HABITAT DROVE THE COMPOSITIONAL VARIATION OF SPECIES.

THIS BACKGROUND IS ESPECIALLY EVIDENT FROM THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF FOSSIL-BEARING SITES IN THE PLEISTOCENE AND HISTORICAL RECORDS OVER THE PAST 800 YEARS. WE ILLUSTRATE CATARRHINES' EARLY DISPERSAL AND RADIATION ROUTES, PATHS, AND LATER SHRINKING TRAJECTORIES, PROVIDING ROBUST EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION FOR MAKING OR AMENDING CONSERVATION STRATEGIES. CATARRHINES (APES AND OLD-WORLD MONKEYS) IN EAST ASIA ARE ANALYZED IN THIS STUDY. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THEIR SPREAD DURING THE PLEISTOCENE FROM THE WEST TO EAST REMARKABLY INVOLVED THE THREE RIVER SYSTEMS (YANGTZE, YELLOW, AND PEARL) AND THE COASTLINES, RESULTING IN BROAD DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE FAR EAST (TAIWAN, KOREA, AND JAPAN). UNFORTUNATELY, THEIR CONTINENTAL TAXA SIGNIFICANTLY SUFFERED REDUCTIONS FROM ANCIENT TO MODERN HOLOCENE, LEADING TO A TREMENDOUS BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN EAST ASIA. THESE EVENTS CORRESPONDED TO MAJOR PERIODIC SOCIAL UPHEAVALS AND ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE LAST CENTURY AND THE POST-WAR PERIOD AFTER 1950 THAT HAS INVOLVED UNPARALLELED ENVIRONMENTAL DEVASTATION AND NATURAL RESOURCE DEPLETION. EXCEPT FOR THE TAXA IN TAIWAN AND JAPAN, PRIMATES IN EAST ASIA WILL FINALLY BE CONFINED TO SOUTHWEST CHINA, ESPECIALLY A CONVERGENCE-DIVERGENCE CENTER (CDC) THAT HAS PLAYED A UNIQUE ROLE IN SHIELDING PRIMATES AND OTHER ANIMALS, AS WELL AS THE PLANTS SINCE THE LATER MIOCENE.

THE INCREASING NUMBER OF ILLEGAL KILLINGS OF THE GREY WOLF (CANIS LUPUS, LINNAEUS, 1758), A THREATENED SPECIES, DISPLAYS THE NEED FOR INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF SUCH OFFENCES. FORENSIC ENTOMOLOGY MAKES USE OF THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT NECROPHAGOUS INSECTS TO ESTIMATE A MINIMUM TIME-SINCE-DEATH INTERVAL OF THE DECEASED PERSON OR ANIMAL, WHICH CAN GIVE IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON A POSSIBLE PERPETRATOR. THE CADAVER FAUNA ALONG FIVE DECOMPOSITION STAGES OF WOLVES IN GERMANY WAS INVESTIGATED IN THE PERIOD 2014–2021. THE INSECTS FROM 70 WOLF CADAVERS, ORIGINATING FROM ALL OVER GERMANY, WERE PROVIDED BY THE LEIBNIZ INSTITUTE FOR ZOO AND WILDLIFE RESEARCH BERLIN. THE ACCUMULATED DEGREE DAY (ADD) MODEL WAS APPLIED FOR THE POST-MORTEM INTERVAL ESTIMATION ON WOLF CADAVERS FOR THE FIRST TIME. A TOTAL OF 20 COLEOPTERAN SPECIES AND 14 DIFFERENT DIPTERAN SPECIES WERE DISCOVERED AND IDENTIFIED. ALMOST 99 % OF ALL INSECT SPECIMENS WERE FROM THE ORDER OF DIPTERA, AND BEETLES (COLEOPTERA) ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY 1 % OF THE CADAVER FAUNA. THE BLOWFLIES (CALLIPHORIDAE) ARE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR FORENSIC ISSUES, ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT 66 % OF ALL FAMILIES. CARRION BEETLES (SILPHIDAE) WERE FOUND AS THE SECOND MOST ABUNDANT FAMILY (ABOUT 21 %). IN ADDITION, COMBINING ALL CASES, A STEADILY INCREASING INSECT SPECIES RICHNESS S WAS DETECTED FROM EARLY DECAY TO ADVANCED DECAY (FRESH S = 8; BLOATED S = 12; ACTIVE DECAY S = 21; ADVANCED DECAY S = 34). IN THE FOLLOWING REMAINS STAGE, THE SPECIES NUMBER DECREASED AGAIN (S = 24). HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF SPECIES WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE STAGES OF DECAY WHEN THE CASES WERE CONSIDERED INDIVIDUALLY. THE TEMPORAL PATTERN OF INSECT APPEARANCE WAS FOUND TO BE CONGRUENT WITH THOSE OF PREVIOUS STUDIES.

USING ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELING AND A LAND-USE MODEL WITHIN THE BRAZILIAN POLITICAL CONTEXT, WE QUANTIFIED CLIMATIC, HABITAT, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUITABILITY FOR CRAX FASCIOLATA UNDER HISTORICAL (2000) AND FUTURE (2050) SCENARIOS. OUR FINDINGS SHOWED THAT ENVIRONMENTAL SUITABILITY CAN INCREASE FOR CRAX FASCIOLATA IN BRAZIL IN FUTURE, BUT THESE EFFECTS VARY ACCORDING TO THE DOMAIN AND THE SPECIFIC FUTURE SCENARIO CONSIDERED. CLIMATICALLY SUITABLE AREAS WILL INCREASE IN ALL SCENARIOS, AND THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL SCENARIOS THAT INCLUDE BETTER HABITAT CONDITIONS WILL PROVIDE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUITABLE AREAS FOR CRAX FASCIOLATA. HOWEVER, THIS INCREASE COMES FROM NEWLY SUITABLE AREAS IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST AND THE AMAZON, WHILE THE PANTANAL, THE CAATINGA, AND THE CERRADO WILL LOSE ENVIRONMENTAL SUITABILITY DUE TO NATIVE VEGETATION LOSS. DESPITE THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE NEW AREAS, REDUCED LANDSCAPE PERMEABILITY MAY HINDER CRAX FASCIOLATA FROM REACHING THEM.

THE MPA IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SPATIALLY SEPARATED ZONES BASED ON HABITAT TYPE: A SEAGRASS ZONE AND A CORAL REEF ZONE. IN THIS STUDY, VISUAL CENSUS DATA WERE COLLECTED IN 2018–2019 AND WERE USED TO DERIVE FISH BIOMASS AND COMMUNITY DIVERSITY METRICS AS PROXIES FOR ECOSYSTEM CONDITION AND FUNCTION (TROPHIC AND MOBILITY). THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MPA IN PROTECTING FISH COMMUNITIES IN THE SEAGRASS AND CORAL REEF ZONES WAS EVALUATED. AN UPDATED CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PHU QUOC FISH COMMUNITIES, AND AN ASSESSMENT OF FISH COMMUNITY VARIATION AMONG REGIONS AND BETWEEN HABITAT TYPES, IS PROVIDED. IN TOTAL, 125 SPECIES REPRESENTING 74 GENERA OF 40 FAMILIES WERE RECORDED. OMNIVORES WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT (38%), FOLLOWED BY PLANKTIVORES (24%), WHEREAS PISCIVORES (2%) WERE SCARCE. THERE WAS AN ESPECIALLY LOW DENSITY OF HIGH-VALUE FISHERY TARGET SPECIES SUCH AS HAEMULIDAE (<0.01%), CARANGIDAE (<0.2%), LETHRINIDAE (<0.3%), LUTJANIDAE (<0.4%), SERRANIDAE (<2%), AND CHAETODONTIDAE (<3%). ALARMINGLY, FISHES WITH A TOTAL LENGTH OF >20 CM ONLY ACCOUNTED FOR 1% OF THE TOTAL INDIVIDUALS. SPECIES AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN PROTECTED AND UNPROTECTED AREAS BUT DIFFERED AMONG REGIONS AND BETWEEN HABITATS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE PROTECTION OF FISHES PROVIDED BY PHU QUOC MPA AT THE TIME OF THIS STUDY WAS INEFFECTIVE.

CAMERA TRAPS TOGETHER WITH ABUNDANCE ESTIMATION METHODS ARE OFTEN EMPLOYED FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE NECESSARY DISTANCES BETWEEN CAMERA AND OBSERVED ANIMALS ARE TRADITIONALLY DERIVED IN A LABORIOUS, FULLY MANUAL OR SEMI-AUTOMATIC PROCESS. BOTH APPROACHES REQUIRE REFERENCE IMAGE MATERIAL, WHICH IS BOTH DIFFICULT TO ACQUIRE AND NOT AVAILABLE FOR EXISTING DATASETS. WE PROPOSE A FULLY AUTOMATIC APPROACH WE CALL AUTOMATED DISTANCE ESTIMATION (AUDIT) TO ESTIMATE CAMERA-TO-ANIMAL DISTANCES. WE LEVERAGE EXISTING STATE-OF-THE-ART RELATIVE MONOCULAR DEPTH ESTIMATION AND COMBINE IT WITH A NOVEL ALIGNMENT PROCEDURE TO ESTIMATE METRIC DISTANCES. AUDIT IS FULLY AUTOMATED AND REQUIRES NEITHER THE COMPARISON OF OBSERVATIONS IN CAMERA TRAP IMAGERY WITH REFERENCE IMAGES NOR CAPTURING OF REFERENCE IMAGE MATERIAL AT ALL. AUDIT THEREFORE RELIEVES BIOLOGISTS AND ECOLOGISTS FROM A SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD.

HERE, WE SYNTHESIZED 73 FIELD STUDIES TO QUANTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL AND/OR INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF GRAZING AND GLOBAL CHANGE FACTORS ON BIODIVERSITY-PRODUCTIVITY RELATIONSHIP IN GRASSLANDS. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT GRAZING SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PLANT RICHNESS BY 3.7% AND ABOVEGROUND NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY (ANPP) BY 29.1%, BUT INCREASED BELOWGROUND NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY (BNPP) BY 9.3%. GLOBAL CHANGE FACTORS, HOWEVER, DECREASED RICHNESS BY 8.0% BUT INCREASED ANPP AND BNPP BY 13.4% AND 14.9%, RESPECTIVELY. INTERESTINGLY, THE STRENGTH OF THE CHANGE IN BIODIVERSITY IN RESPONSE TO GRAZING WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE CHANGE IN BNPP. YET, GLOBAL CHANGE FLIPPED THESE RELATIONSHIPS FROM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE EVEN WHEN COMBINED WITH GRAZING. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE IMPACTS OF GLOBAL CHANGE FACTORS ARE MORE DOMINANT THAN GRAZING ON THE BELOWGROUND BIODIVERSITY-PRODUCTIVITY RELATIONSHIP, WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE PATTERN OF ABOVEGROUND ONE.

FIRST, ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELLING WAS USED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN AREAS ACCESSIBLE TO ANATOLIAN GROUND SQUIRRELS THROUGH DISPERSAL (I.E. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE). SECOND, BASED ON THE HABITAT PREFERENCES OF GROUND SQUIRRELS, LAND-USE DATA WERE USED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF LAND-USE CHANGE IN SUITABLE BIOCLIMATIC AREAS FOR ANATOLIAN GROUND SQUIRRELS UNDER PRESENT AND FUTURE CONDITIONS (I.E.

THESE LOSSES NECESSITATE COORDINATED CONSERVATION ACTIONS GUIDED BY BIODIVERSITY AND SPECIES DISTRIBUTION SPATIAL DATA THAT COVER LARGE AREAS YET HAVE FINE-ENOUGH RESOLUTION TO BE MANAGEMENT-RELEVANT (I.E., ≤5 KM). HOWEVER, MOST BIODIVERSITY PRODUCTS ARE TOO COARSE FOR MANAGEMENT OR ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR SMALL AREAS. FURTHERMORE, MANY MAPS GENERATED FOR BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT AND CONSERVATION DO NOT EXPLICITLY QUANTIFY THE INHERENT TRADEOFF BETWEEN RESOLUTION AND ACCURACY WHEN PREDICTING BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS. OUR GOALS WERE TO GENERATE PREDICTIVE MODELS OF OVERALL BREEDING BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF DIFFERENT GUILDS BASED ON NINE FUNCTIONAL OR LIFE-HISTORY-BASED TRAITS ACROSS THE CONTERMINOUS UNITED STATES AT THREE RESOLUTIONS (0.5, 2.5, AND 5 KM) AND QUANTIFY THE TRADEOFF BETWEEN RESOLUTION AND ACCURACY AND, HENCE, RELEVANCE FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE RESULTING BIODIVERSITY MAPS. WE SUMMARIZED 18 YEARS OF NORTH AMERICAN BREEDING BIRD SURVEY DATA (1992–2019) AND MODELED SPECIES RICHNESS USING RANDOM FORESTS, INCLUDING 66 PREDICTOR VARIABLES (DESCRIBING CLIMATE, VEGETATION, GEOMORPHOLOGY, AND ANTHROPOGENIC CONDITIONS), 20 OF WHICH WE NEWLY DERIVED. AMONG THE THREE SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS, THE PERCENTAGE VARIANCE EXPLAINED RANGED FROM 27% TO 60% (MEDIAN = 54%; MEAN = 57%) FOR OVERALL SPECIES RICHNESS AND 12% TO 87% (MEDIAN = 61%; MEAN = 58%) FOR OUR DIFFERENT GUILDS. OVERALL SPECIES RICHNESS AND GUILD-SPECIFIC SPECIES RICHNESS WERE BEST EXPLAINED AT 5-KM RESOLUTION USING ~24 PREDICTOR VARIABLES BASED ON PERCENTAGE VARIANCE EXPLAINED, SYMMETRIC MEAN ABSOLUTE PERCENTAGE ERROR, AND ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR VALUES.

WORLDWIDE, LAND MODIFICATION TO ACCOMMODATE HUMAN RESOURCE NEEDS HAS CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN WILDLIFE POPULATIONS. TO HELP MINIMIZE BIODIVERSITY LOSS, WE MUST SUPPORT WILDLIFE ON HUMAN-DOMINATED LAND, SUCH AS FARMS AND URBAN AREAS, BUT OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO DO SO IS LACKING. AGRICULTURE IS A MAJOR DRIVER OF LAND MODIFICATION; BUT ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PLAY A ROLE IN CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY. TO SUPPORT CRITICALLY ENDANGERED ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS THAT USE FARMS, SUCH AS GIANT GALAPAGOS TORTOISES, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CHARACTERISTICS ENCOURAGING OR HINDERING THEM. TO QUANTIFY TORTOISE HABITAT PREFERENCES, WE ASSESSED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TORTOISE DENSITY, HABITAT STRUCTURE, AND LAND-USE TYPE, BY RECORDING TORTOISE DENSITY ON FARMS ON SANTA CRUZ ISLAND, GALAPAGOS, OVER TWO YEARS. TORTOISE DENSITY WAS LOWEST IN ABANDONED FARMLAND AND HIGHEST IN TOURIST AREAS AND WAS MOST STRONGLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH ABUNDANT GROUND COVER, SHORT VEGETATION, AND FEW SHRUBS. THE HABITAT FEATURES FAVOURED BY TORTOISES COULD POTENTIALLY BE MANIPULATED TO HELP SUPPORT TORTOISE CONSERVATION ON FARMS.

APPL.,1,"DEDICATED LONG-TERM MONITORING AT APPROPRIATE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND BIODIVERSITY LOSSES AND DEVELOP EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION PLANS. WILDLIFE MONITORING IS OFTEN ACHIEVED BY OBTAINING DATA AT A COMBINATION OF SPATIAL SCALES, RANGING FROM LOCAL TO BROAD, TO UNDERSTAND THE STATUS, TRENDS, AND DRIVERS OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES OR WHOLE COMMUNITIES AND THEIR DYNAMICS. HOWEVER, LIMITED RESOURCES FOR MONITORING NECESSITATES TRADEOFFS IN THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF DATA COLLECTION. CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL ALLOCATION OF FINITE SAMPLING EFFORT IS CRUCIAL FOR MONITORING PROGRAMS THAT SPAN MULTIPLE SPATIAL SCALES. HERE WE EVALUATE THE ABILITY OF FIVE MONITORING DESIGNS—STRATIFIED RANDOM, WEIGHTED EFFORT, INDICATOR UNIT, ROTATING PANEL, AND SPLIT PANEL—TO RECOVER PARAMETER VALUES THAT DESCRIBE THE STATUS (OCCUPANCY), TRENDS (CHANGE IN OCCUPANCY), AND DRIVERS (SPATIALLY VARYING COVARIATE AND AN AUTOLOGISTIC TERM) OF WILDLIFE COMMUNITIES AT TWO SPATIAL SCALES. USING AN AMPHIBIAN MONITORING PROGRAM THAT SPANS A NETWORK OF US NATIONAL PARKS AS A MOTIVATING EXAMPLE, WE CONDUCTED A SIMULATION STUDY FOR A REGIONAL COMMUNITY OCCUPANCY SAMPLING PROGRAM TO COMPARE THE MONITORING DESIGNS ACROSS VARYING LEVELS OF SAMPLING EFFORT (RANGING FROM 10% TO 50%). WE FOUND THAT THE STRATIFIED RANDOM DESIGN OUTPERFORMED THE OTHER DESIGNS FOR MOST PARAMETERS OF INTEREST AT BOTH SCALES AND WAS THUS GENERALLY PREFERABLE IN BALANCING THE ESTIMATION OF STATUS, TRENDS, AND DRIVERS ACROSS SCALES. HOWEVER, WE FOUND THAT OTHER DESIGNS HAD IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROTATING PANEL DESIGN PERFORMED BEST AT ESTIMATING SPATIAL DRIVERS AT A REGIONAL LEVEL. THUS, OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE NUANCED SCENARIOS IN WHICH VARIOUS DESIGN STRATEGIES MAY BE PREFERRED AND OFFER GUIDANCE AS TO HOW MANAGERS CAN BALANCE COMMON TRADEOFFS IN LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM MONITORING PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE GAINED.

IN TEMPERATE REGIONS AVIAN SPECIES RICHNESS–URBANIZATION INTENSITY RELATIONSHIPS TYPICALLY EXHIBIT UNIMODAL PATTERNS, WITH PEAK RICHNESS AT INTERMEDIATE URBANIZATION LEVELS. IN TROPICAL REGIONS, THE FORM OF SUCH RELATIONSHIPS AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE MODERATED BY PATCHES OF SEMINATURAL HABITAT ARE UNCLEAR. WE ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS IN BANGKOK, THAILAND (ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST RAPIDLY EXPANDING TROPICAL MEGA-CITIES) AND GENERATE CONSERVATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TROPICAL BIODIVERSITY IN URBAN LOCATIONS. WE USE REPEATED POINT COUNT SURVEYS AT A RANDOM LOCATION, AND THE LARGEST AVAILABLE WOODLAND PATCH, IN 150 1 KM × 1 KM GRID CELLS SELECTED ALONG THE URBANIZATION GRADIENT. WOODLAND PATCHES SUPPORT HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS COMPARED WITH RANDOMIZED LOCATIONS (EXCEPT FOR NON-NATIVES), AND AVIAN SPECIES RICHNESS DECLINES LINEARLY WITH INCREASING URBANIZATION. THE CONTRAST WITH UNIMODAL PATTERNS IN TEMPERATE REGIONS IS PROBABLY DRIVEN BY DIVERGENT PATTERNS OF HABITAT HETEROGENEITY ALONG TROPICAL AND TEMPERATE URBANIZATION GRADIENTS. MOREOVER, WE PROVIDE NOVEL EVIDENCE THAT RETAINING PATCHES OF URBAN WOODLAND MODERATES ADVERSE IMPACTS OF URBANIZATION ON AVIAN SPECIES RICHNESS. FOR MOST SPECIES GROUPS, THE BENEFITS OF WOODLAND INCREASE AS URBANIZATION INTENSIFIES, DESPITE SUCH WOODLAND PATCHES BEING VERY SMALL (MEAN OF 0.38 HA). AVIAN SPECIES RICHNESS IN WOODLAND PATCHES IS MAXIMIZED, AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION LESS SIMILAR TO THAT IN RANDOMIZED LOCATIONS, WHEN WOODLAND PATCHES ARE LARGER AND VISITED BY FEWER PEOPLE. ASSEMBLAGES OF FOREST-DEPENDENT SPECIES (WHICH PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS) HAVE HIGHER RICHNESS, AND ARE LESS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN RANDOMIZED LOCATIONS, IN PATCHES OF WOODLAND WITH HIGHER TREE SPECIES RICHNESS AND BIOMASS. FINALLY, SPECIES RICHNESS IN RANDOMIZED SITES IS GREATEST WHEN THEY ARE CLOSER TO WOODLAND PATCHES, AND SUCH ASSEMBLAGES MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLE THOSE OF WOODLAND SITES. OUR WORK HIGHLIGHTS FOUR STRATEGIES FOR TROPICAL URBAN BIRD CONSERVATION: (1) CONSERVING WOODLAND PATCHES ACROSS THE URBANIZATION GRADIENT REGARDLESS OF PATCH SIZE, (2) IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF EXISTING WOODLAND BY INCREASING TREE BIOMASS AND DIVERSITY, (3) CREATING ADDITIONAL WOODLAND THAT IS WELL DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE URBAN AREA TO MINIMIZE EFFECTS OF HABITAT ISOLATION AND (4) REDUCING HUMAN DISTURBANCE, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF THE HIGHEST HABITAT QUALITY, WHILE ENSURING THAT THE BENEFITS OF CONNECTING PEOPLE TO NATURE ARE REALIZED IN OTHER LOCATIONS. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

WE FURTHER COMPARE SPECIFIC TRAITS OF A WORLDWIDE FISH LIST TO OUR SAMPLE TO ASSESS ITS REPRESENTATIVENESS. OVERALL, 15.1% OF SPECIES IN THE SAMPLE WERE ESTIMATED TO BE THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION, RESULTING IN A SAMPLED RLI OF 0.914 FOR ALL SPECIES, 0.968 IN MARINE AND 0.862 IN FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS. OUR SAMPLE SHOWED FISHING AS THE PRINCIPAL THREAT FOR MARINE SPECIES, AND POLLUTION BY AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY EFFLUENTS FOR FRESHWATER FISHES.

COFFEE, A MAJOR EXPORT OF TROPICAL COUNTRIES, OFFERS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE HOW DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES CAN LEAD TO A VARIETY OF OUTCOMES IN FOOD SECURITY, ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. OUR STUDY EXAMINED THIS INTERSECTION TO IDENTIFY TRADEOFFS AND SYNERGIES USING COMPILED DATA FROM PUERTO RICO. AT THE ISLAND LEVEL, WE ANALYZED DATA ON COFFEE YIELD AND PLANTED AREA UNDER SHADE OR SUN MANAGEMENT. AT THE FARM LEVEL, WE ANALYZED MANAGEMENT VARIABLES (PERCENT SHADE COVER, MAXIMUM CANOPY HEIGHT, GROUND COVER, AND FOOD CROP RICHNESS), NON-PROVISIONING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES VARIABLES (TOTAL FARM CARBON STORAGE, SOIL ORGANIC CARBON STORAGE, COFFEE PLANT CARBON BIOMASS, AND HURRICANE RESISTANCE AND RESILIENCE), AND BIODIVERSITY VARIABLES (ANT, BIRD, AND LIZARD RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE). AT THE ISLAND LEVEL, WE FOUND THAT PLANTED AREA WAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF TOTAL PRODUCTION, SUGGESTING NO OBVIOUS TRADEOFF BETWEEN PRODUCTION AND SHADE MANAGEMENT IN COFFEE FARMS. AT THE FARM LEVEL, CANOPY COVER OF SHADE TREES WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH GROUND COVER AND POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH FOOD CROP RICHNESS, SUGGESTING A SYNERGY BETWEEN AGROFORESTRY AND SUBSISTENCE FOOD PRODUCTION. WE DETECTED MOSTLY SYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, AND AGROFORESTRY MANAGEMENT AND NO TRADEOFFS AMONG ECOSYSTEM SERVICE AND BIODIVERSITY PARAMETERS. SHADE CANOPY COVER SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED TOTAL CARBON STORAGE, COFFEE PLANT BIOMASS, HURRICANE RESISTANCE, AND BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS. SHADE CANOPY HEIGHT HAD A SIMILAR POSITIVE EFFECT ON TOTAL FARM CARBON STORAGE WHILE FOOD CROP RICHNESS HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON FARM RESILIENCE FOLLOWING HURRICANE MARIA. GROUND COVER WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH SOIL CARBON STORAGE AND PEST-CONTROLLING LIZARD ABUNDANCE. TRADEOFFS RELATED TO AGROFORESTRY MANAGEMENT INCLUDED AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GROUND COVER AND HURRICANE RESISTANCE AND MORE DOMINANCE OF AN INVASIVE ANT SPECIES IN FARMS WITH HIGHER SHADE CANOPIES.

THEREFORE, INTERVENTIONS SIMILAR TO NBS WERE USED FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE THIS TERM WAS FIRST INTRODUCED. SUCH PRE-EXISTING ACTIONS, TO BE CONSIDERED AS NBS, MUST MEET THE GLOBAL STANDARDS FORMULATED BY THE UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE GLOBAL STANDARDS. ONE OF THESE STANDARDS REFERS TO THE CHALLENGE-ORIENTATION OF NBS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO PROPOSE OBJECTIVE CRITERIA THAT ENABLE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE CHALLENGE-ORIENTATION OF SUCH INTERVENTIONS. TO THIS END, A SET OF CRITERIA REFERRING TO THE SEVEN SOCIETAL CHALLENGES WAS PRESENTED. A LUBLIN CITY (POLAND) CASE STUDY WAS APPLIED IN RELATION TO 24 TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT ALL OF THE ANALYSED PRE-EXISTING ACTIONS MET AT LEAST TWO OF THE CHALLENGES. THE ACTIONS WITH THE GREATEST CHALLENGE-ORIENTATION POTENTIAL CONTINUITY FOR ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS ARE: PROTECTING SURFACE WETLANDS, PUBLIC PARKS, ALLOTMENT GARDENS, RESTORING WATERBODIES AND MAINTAINING FLOODPLAINS, AND THE LOWEST POTENTIAL ARE: CREATING NESTING BOXES FOR BATS AND INSECT HOTELS, INSTALLING APIARIES AND BELOW-GROUND RAINWATER COLLECTION SYSTEMS.

ON ONE HAND, THE LOSS OF AN APEX PREDATOR LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN PRIMARY PREY SPECIES, TRIGGERING A TROPHIC CASCADE OF OTHER CHANGES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, WHILE DENSITY COMPENSATION AND ECOLOGICAL RELEASE CAN OCCUR BECAUSE OF REDUCED COMPETITION FOR RESOURCES AND ABSENCE OF DIRECT AGGRESSION.

USING A TEMPORALLY REPLICATED CAMERA TRAPPING DATASET, IN BOTH A PRE- AND POST- WLP CRASH, WE EXPLORE HOW WLP DISAPPEARANCE ALTERS THE STRUCTURE OF A NEOTROPICAL VERTEBRATE COMMUNITY WITH FINDINGS INDICATIVE OF DENSITY COMPENSATION. WHITE-LIPPED PECCARY WERE THE MOST FREQUENTLY DETECTED TERRESTRIAL MAMMAL IN THE 2006–2007 PRE-POPULATION CRASH PERIOD BUT WERE UNDETECTED DURING THE 2019 POST-CRASH SURVEY.

CONSERV.,1,"HALTING BIODIVERSITY LOSS IS A MAJOR CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGE. NATURE PROTECTION CAN HELP CONSERVE BIODIVERSITY, BUT INCREASING WILDLIFE NUMBERS INSIDE PROTECTED AREAS AND SHRINKING HABITATS INTENSIFY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HUMANS AND WILDLIFE, POTENTIALLY CAUSING HUMAN–WILDLIFE CONFLICT (HWC). CONTEMPORARY NARRATIVES OF HWC HIGHLIGHT DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON HOUSEHOLDS' SOCIOECONOMIC OUTCOMES. DESPITE A WEALTH OF LITERATURE ON HWC, MANY STUDIES REMAIN DESCRIPTIVE AND LITTLE INFERENTIAL EVIDENCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED. HERE WE IDENTIFY THE DETERMINANTS AND EFFECTS OF REPORTED HWC ON HOUSEHOLD OUTCOMES USING SPATIAL PREDICTORS AND AN ORIGINAL FARM-HOUSEHOLD DATASET COLLECTED IN NAMIBIA'S SHARE OF THE KAVANGO-ZAMBEZI TRANSFRONTIER CONSERVATION AREA. IN ADDITION TO DEPENDENCE ON AGRICULTURE, WE FIND THAT COMMUNITY-BASED CONSERVATION, THE SHARE OF A COMMUNITY'S AREA SET ASIDE FOR CONSERVATION, AND HABITAT CONNECTIVITY ARE KEY DRIVERS OF HWC. CONTRARY TO CONTEMPORARY NARRATIVES OF HWC, WE FIND THAT REPORTED CONFLICTS DID NOT HAVE STRONG NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND LIVELIHOOD DIVERSITY. CONVERSELY, COMMUNITY-BASED WILDLIFE CONSERVATION INCREASES INCOME AND LIVELIHOOD DIVERSITY AMONG PARTICIPATING HOUSEHOLDS. IT IS, HOWEVER, ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH FOOD INSECURITY CONCERNS. SUCH CONCERNS MAY BE DRIVEN BY COMPARATIVELY HIGHER RESTRICTIONS RELATED TO LAND USE PLANNING AND ZONING THAT CONSTRAIN PRODUCTIVE LAND USES, SUCH AS AGRICULTURE. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT COMMUNITY-BASED CONSERVATION CAN CREATE DEVELOPMENT SYNERGIES FOR HOUSEHOLDS IN FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTS, DESPITE INCREASING HWC RISKS.

THE EXTINCTION OF LARGE CARNIVORES CAN HAVE RAMIFYING EFFECTS ON ECOSYSTEMS LIKE AN UNCONTROLLED INCREASE IN WILD HERBIVORES, WHICH IN TURN CAN HAVE KNOCK-ON IMPACTS ON VEGETATION REGENERATION AND COMMUNITIES. CHEETAHS (ACINONYX JUBATUS) SERVE IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS AS APEX PREDATORS; YET, THEY ARE QUICKLY HEADING TOWARDS AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE. THREATENED BY HABITAT LOSS, HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICT AND ILLEGAL TRAFFICKING, THERE ARE ONLY APPROXIMATELY 7100 INDIVIDUALS REMAINING IN NATURE. WE PRESENT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE GENOME-WIDE ANALYSIS OF CHEETAH PHYLOGEOGRAPHY AND CONSERVATION GENOMICS TO DATE, ASSEMBLING SAMPLES FROM NEARLY THE ENTIRE CURRENT AND PAST SPECIES' RANGE. WE SHOW THAT THEIR PHYLOGEOGRAPHY IS MORE COMPLEX THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT, AND THAT EAST AFRICAN CHEETAHS (A. J. RAINEYI) ARE GENETICALLY DISTINCT FROM SOUTHERN AFRICAN INDIVIDUALS (A. J. JUBATUS), WARRANTING THEIR RECOGNITION AS A DISTINCT SUBSPECIES. WE FOUND STRONG GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN ALL CLASSICALLY RECOGNIZED SUBSPECIES, THUS REFUTING EARLIER FINDINGS THAT CHEETAHS SHOW ONLY LITTLE DIFFERENTIATION. THE STRONGEST DIFFERENTIATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE ASIATIC AND ALL THE AFRICAN SUBSPECIES. WE DETECTED HIGH INBREEDING IN THE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED IRANIAN (A. J. VENATICUS) AND NORTH-WESTERN (A. J. HECKI) SUBSPECIES, AND SHOW THAT OVERALL CHEETAHS, ALONG WITH SNOW LEOPARDS, HAVE THE LOWEST GENOME-WIDE HETEROZYGOSITY OF ALL THE BIG CATS. THIS FURTHER EMPHASIZES THE CHEETAH'S PERILOUS CONSERVATION STATUS. OUR RESULTS PROVIDE NOVEL AND IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON CHEETAH PHYLOGEOGRAPHY THAT CAN SUPPORT EVIDENCE-BASED CONSERVATION POLICY DECISIONS TO HELP PROTECT THIS SPECIES.

INDIC.,1,"UNSUSTAINABLE HUNTING IS ONE OF THE LEADING DRIVERS OF GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY LOSS, YET VERY FEW DIRECT MEASURES EXIST DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY IN MONITORING THIS CRYPTIC ACTIVITY. WHERE GUNS ARE COMMONLY USED FOR HUNTING, SUCH AS IN THE TROPICAL FORESTS OF THE AMERICAS AND AFRICA, ACOUSTIC DETECTION CAN POTENTIALLY PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO THIS MONITORING CHALLENGE. THE EMERGENCE OF LOW COST AUTONOMOUS RECORDING UNITS (ARUS) BRINGS INTO REACH THE ABILITY TO MONITOR HUNTING PRESSURE OVER WIDE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. HOWEVER, ARUS PRODUCE IMMENSE AMOUNTS OF DATA, AND LONG TERM AND LARGE-SCALE MONITORING IS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT EFFICIENT AUTOMATED SOUND CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUES. WE TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SEQUENTIAL TWO-STAGE DETECTION PIPELINE FOR DETECTING GUNSHOTS FROM ACOUSTIC DATA COLLECTED IN THE TROPICAL FORESTS OF BELIZE. THE PIPELINE INVOLVED AN ON-BOARD DETECTION ALGORITHM WHICH WAS DEVELOPED AND TESTED IN A PRIOR STUDY, FOLLOWED BY A SPECTROGRAM BASED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN), WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN THIS MANUSCRIPT. AS GUNSHOTS ARE RARE EVENTS, WE FOCUSSED ON DEVELOPING A CLASSIFICATION PIPELINE THAT MAXIMISES RECALL AT THE COST OF INCREASED FALSE POSITIVES, WITH THE AIM OF USING THE CLASSIFIER TO ASSIST HUMAN ANNOTATION OF FILES. WE TRAINED THE CNN ON ANNOTATED DATA COLLECTED ACROSS TWO STUDY SITES IN BELIZE, COMPRISING 597 GUNSHOTS AND 28,195 BACKGROUND SOUNDS. PREDICTIONS FROM THE ANNOTATED VALIDATION DATASET COMPRISING 150 GUNSHOTS AND 7044 BACKGROUND SOUNDS COLLECTED FROM THE SAME SITES YIELDED A RECALL OF 0.95 AND PRECISION OF 0.85. THE COMBINED RECALL OF THE TWO-STEP PIPELINE WAS ESTIMATED AT 0.80.

PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THAT AMPHIBIANS QUICKLY DISAPPEAR AFTER TROUT INTRODUCTION, FOLLOWED BY MANY CONSPICUOUS INVERTEBRATES. HERE, WE HAVE STUDIED THE EFFECTS OF MINNOWS VERSUS TROUT ON THE LITTORAL MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY OF 54 HIGH MOUNTAIN LAKES FROM THE PYRENEES, COVERING A GRADIENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS. THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF FISH COMPARED TO OTHER VARIABLES IN EXPLAINING MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES WAS ASSESSED USING DISTANCE-BASED REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS (DBRDA) AND MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION TREE (MRT) TO FIND THE MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL THRESHOLDS. BOTH DBRDA AND MRT APPROACHES REVEALED THAT MINNOW DENSITY WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLE NEGATIVELY DETERMINING COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, FOLLOWED BY AQUATIC MACROPHYTES, WHICH INCREASED TAXA RICHNESS. THE OCCURRENCE AND ABUNDANCE OF RELEVANT TAXA WAS ANALYSED IN RELATION TO FISH DENSITIES AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS USING BINOMIAL AND GAMMA GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS (GLM). GLM SUGGESTED THAT TROUT HAD AN IMPACT ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF SWIMMER TAXA AND CAUSED DECLINES IN THE ABUNDANCE OF CONSPICUOUS CLINGER AND BURROWER TAXA. MINNOWS RESTRICTED THE OCCURRENCE OF MORE TAXA THAN TROUT AND NEGATIVELY AFFECTED A WIDE VARIETY OF BODY SIZES AND FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. INDEED, WE FOUND THAT MINNOWS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR A DRAMATIC BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN THE LITTORAL MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY. THE FAST SPREAD OF MINNOWS IN HIGH MOUNTAIN AREAS IS OF GREAT CONCERN FOR THE CONSERVATION OF LAKE MACROINVERTEBRATES.

BOLD NEW APPROACHES TO BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION ARE NEEDED. PROMOTING AN ENGAGED COMMUNITY IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF ACHIEVING CONSERVATION OUTCOMES. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CITIZEN SCIENCE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ELICIT CONSERVATION ENGAGEMENT. HOWEVER, RESEARCH HAS NOT SPECIFICALLY EXPLORED HOW INTENSIVE CITIZEN SCIENCE EXPEDITION PROGRAMS CONTRIBUTE TO CHANGE. HERE WE USE TRANSFORMATIVE LEARNING THEORY AS A TOOL TO INVESTIGATE HOW PARTICIPATION IN CITIZEN SCIENCE PROGRAMS INFLUENCES CONSERVATION ENGAGEMENT. WE ANALYSED EVALUATION SURVEYS OF EARTHWATCH INSTITUTE CITIZEN SCIENCE PARTICIPANTS (N = 608) AND CONDUCTED IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS (N = 11), TO EXAMINE THE LINKS BETWEEN CITIZEN SCIENCE EXPERIENCES AND ENGAGEMENT OUTCOMES. WE DISCOVERED THAT WHILE NATURE-BASED COMPONENTS OF CITIZEN SCIENCE PROGRAMS ATTRACT PARTICIPANTS AND CREATE A SALIENT ENVIRONMENT FOR TRANSFORMATION, THESE ARE NOT OBJECTIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ENGAGEMENT OUTCOMES. STRENGTHENED AWARENESS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LEARNING, SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND CULTURAL EXPERIENCES, WHEREAS INTENTIONS TO ENGAGE IN CONSERVATION ACTION WAS ONLY INFLUENCED BY EXPERIENCING A SENSE OF CONTRIBUTION. RATHER THAN FOCUSING ONLY ON LEARNING AND NATURE EXPERIENCES, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE ELEMENTS OF CITIZEN SCIENCE PROGRAMS WHICH SUPPORT SOCIAL CHANGE MAY REQUIRE ALLOWING PARTICIPANTS TO DEVELOP A SENSE OF CONTRIBUTION AMID AN INTERACTIVE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT.

APPL. ECOL.,1,"INVASIVE SPECIES ARE ONE OF THE GREATEST DRIVERS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS WORLDWIDE, AND THE ERADICATION OF INVASIVE SPECIES FROM ISLANDS IS A HIGHLY EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. BECAUSE ERADICATION OPERATIONS REQUIRE LARGE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS, UNCERTAINTY OVER THE MAGNITUDE OF IMPACTS OF BOTH INVASIVE SPECIES AND THEIR REMOVAL CAN IMPEDE THE WILLINGNESS OF DECISION MAKERS TO INVEST IN ERADICATION. SUCH UNCERTAINTY IS PREVALENT FOR LONG-LIVED SPECIES THAT DISPLAY AN INHERENT LAG BETWEEN LIFE STAGES AFFECTED BY INVASIVE SPECIES AND THOSE USED FOR POPULATION STATUS ASSESSMENTS. ALBATROSSES ARE AMONGST THE LONGEST-LIVING BIRD SPECIES AND ARE THREATENED ON LAND BY INVASIVE SPECIES AND AT SEA BY INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES. AS IN MANY SEABIRD SPECIES, USUALLY ONLY A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION (BREEDING ADULTS) IS USED FOR STATUS ASSESSMENTS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ASSESS ALBATROSS POPULATION TRENDS AND THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF CONSERVATION ACTION, SUCH AS THE MANAGEMENT OF PREDATORY INVASIVE SPECIES. WE USED POPULATION MONITORING AND MARK-RECAPTURE DATA TO ESTIMATE THE PAST POPULATION TRAJECTORY OF THE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED TRISTAN ALBATROSS DIOMEDEA DABBENENA BY ACCOUNTING FOR UNOBSERVABLE BIRDS AT SEA IN AN INTEGRATED POPULATION MODEL. WE THEN PROJECTED THE FUTURE POPULATION TRAJECTORY OF TRISTAN ALBATROSSES FOR SCENARIOS WITH OR WITHOUT PREDATION BY INVASIVE HOUSE MICE MUS MUSCULUS ON THEIR MAIN BREEDING SITE, GOUGH ISLAND. THE ADULT BREEDING POPULATION REMAINED STABLE BETWEEN 2004 AND 2021, BUT BREEDING SUCCESS WAS LOW (31%) AND OUR MODEL INDICATED THAT THE TOTAL POPULATION (INCLUDING UNOBSERVABLE IMMATURE BIRDS) DECREASED FROM A MEDIAN ESTIMATE OF 9,795 TO 7,752 BIRDS. ERADICATING INVASIVE MICE LEADING TO A TWO-FOLD INCREASE IN BREEDING SUCCESS WOULD RESULT IN A 1.8–7.6 TIMES HIGHER ALBATROSS POPULATION BY 2050 (MEDIAN ESTIMATE 10,352 INDIVIDUALS) THAN WITHOUT THIS INTERVENTION. LOW REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT FOR LONG-LIVED SPECIES MAY LEAD TO A CRYPTIC POPULATION DECREASE, WHICH CAN BE OBSCURED FROM READILY AVAILABLE COUNTS OF BREEDING PAIRS BY CHANGES IN THE POPULATION STRUCTURE.

A COMMON CONSERVATION SOLUTION IS TO PROVIDE ARTIFICIAL ROOSTS (I.E. BAT BOXES), BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT THESE CAN BECOME HOTTER THAN NATURAL ROOSTS IN SUMMER AND COULD BE DEATH TRAPS DURING HEAT WAVES. NEVERTHELESS, FEMALES OF SEVERAL BAT SPECIES FORM MATERNITY COLONIES IN THESE BOXES, THUS OCCUPYING HOTTER AND MORE HUMID MICROCLIMATES THAN SOLITARILY ROOSTING MALES. WE TESTED IF COOLING EFFICIENCY AND HEAT TOLERANCE DIFFER BETWEEN SEXES IN EUROPEAN BATS, AND ESTIMATED THE EVAPORATIVE WATER REQUIREMENTS FOR BATS LIVING IN BAT BOXES DURING HOT SUMMER DAYS. WE USED INDIRECT CALORIMETRY AND THERMOMETRY TO QUANTIFY THERMOREGULATION AT HIGH AIR TEMPERATURES (TA) IN FOUR SPECIES OF VERSPITILIONID BATS THAT REGULARLY OCCUPY ARTIFICIAL ROOSTS. WE MEASURED RESTING METABOLIC HEAT PRODUCTION, EVAPORATIVE WATER LOSS RATES (EWL) AND BODY TEMPERATURE (TB) AT TA BETWEEN 28°C AND 48°C DURING SUMMER. WE PREDICTED THAT FEMALES HAVE HIGHER EVAPORATIVE COOLING EFFICIENCY (EVAPORATIVE HEAT LOSS/METABOLIC HEAT PRODUCTION) THAN MALES, ALLOWING THEM TO REACH THEIR HEAT TOLERANCE LIMIT AT HIGHER TA. WE FOUND NO SEX DIFFERENCES IN MAXIMUM EVAPORATIVE COOLING EFFICIENCY, MAXIMUM TB, AND MAXIMUM TA TOLERATED. HOWEVER, THE PATTERNS OF INCREASING EWL WITH TA DIFFERED BETWEEN SEXES. FEMALES TOLERATED HIGHER TA BEFORE INCREASING EWL THAN MALES AND THEN RAPIDLY INCREASED EWL TO HIGHER VALUES THAN MALES AT THE MAXIMUM TA TOLERATED. THESE SEX DIFFERENCES IN HEAT DISSIPATION STRATEGIES MAY REFLECT VARYING ECOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT SUMMER ROOSTING HABITS. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR STUDY REVEALED THAT SOME SMALL EUROPEAN BAT SPECIES ARE ALREADY AT RISK OF SUCCUMBING TO LETHAL DEHYDRATION DURING PRESENT-DAY HEAT WAVES, WITH DAYTIME EVAPORATIVE WATER REQUIREMENTS EQUIVALENT TO ~30% OF BODY MASS IN SUN-EXPOSED BOXES. FOR CONSERVATION MANAGERS WORKING WITH COMMON EUROPEAN BAT SPECIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN MONOCULTURE FORESTS WITH WOODCRETE BAT-BOXES, OUR PHYSIOLOGICALLY INFORMED RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE POSITIONING BOXES IN DIVERSE LOCATIONS VARYING IN ASPECT AND SUN EXPOSURE.

PAP.,1,"THE RIO GRANDE RISE (RGR) IS A LARGE AND GEOMORPHOLOGICALLY COMPLEX FEATURE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHWEST ATLANTIC, WITH GREAT COMMERCIAL AND SCIENTIFIC INTEREST DUE TO ITS POTENTIAL FOR MINING RARE EARTH ELEMENTS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR LOW-CARBON TECHNOLOGIES. BRAZILIAN INTEREST IN THIS AREA LED TO THE SUBMISSION OF A PETITION TO THE UN COMMISSION ON THE LIMITS OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF IN 2018 TO INCLUDE RGR ON THE LIMITS OF ITS CONTINENTAL SHELF BEYOND 200 NAUTICAL MILES. HOWEVER, MINING ACTIVITIES ARE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL TO DEEP-SEA ECOSYSTEMS AND WILL LIKELY CAUSE SOME EXTENT OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS. THUS, BASELINE AND CONTINUOUS ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES IN THE RGR ARE IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN MINERAL EXTRACTION AND THE CONSERVATION OF DEEP-SEA BIODIVERSITY. THE RGR IS CHARACTERIZED BY A SERIES OF SUMMIT PLATEAUS OF ∼600 M DEEP DIVIDED NE-SW BY A RIFT VALLEY, UP TO 2000 M DEEP. IN 2018, THE PLATEAUS AND RIFT OF A SMALL AREA IN RGR (30°35′S – 31°03′S, 35°36′W – 36°16′W) WERE EXPLORED THROUGH 13 DIVES OF THE ROBOTIC UNDERWATER VEHICLE (RUV) HYBIS. VIDEOS WERE ANALYZED FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF STRUCTURING FACTORS (TOPOGRAPHY AND HABITAT TYPES) AND TO RECORD BENTHIC MEGAFAUNA OCCURRENCES. VIDEO TRANSECTS REVEALED HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS AND RAPIDLY CHANGING HABITATS. ELEVEN HABITATS, FIVE IN THE RIFT AND SIX IN THE PLATEAUS ARE PROPOSED BASED ON GEOMORPHOLOGY, SLOPE, AND SUBSTRATE TEXTURES. WE RECORDED 17,008 MEGABENTHIC ORGANISMS CLASSIFIED IN 83 MORPHOTYPES AND SIX DIFFERENT PHYLA, FROM WHICH PORIFERA (42.7%) AND CNIDARIA (41.5%) WERE THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE. SAMPLES WERE CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH DOMINANCE AND THE DISSIMILARITIES RESULT CHIEFLY FROM DIFFERENCES IN ABUNDANCE SCORES. PERMANOVA TESTS INDICATED THAT HABITAT AND REGION VARIABLES WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO EXPLAIN STRUCTURE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY DATA, FOLLOWED BY DEPTH AND SLOPE. THE RIFT FLOOR EXHIBITED A LOW ABUNDANCE OF MEGABENTHIC EPIFAUNA, EXCEPT IN A SINKHOLE IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE RIFT. THE LOWER AND UPPER RIFT WALL WERE CHARACTERIZED BY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES DELIMITED BY THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE ANTARCTIC INTERMEDIATE WATER AND THE UPPER CIRCUMPOLAR DEEP WATER. THE HABITATS FORMED BY FE–MN DEPOSITS WERE DOMINATED BY DISTINCT COMMUNITIES, WHICH WERE RARELY OBSERVED ELSEWHERE. ADDITIONALLY, WE FOUND VARIATIONS IN COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AT REGIONAL SCALES (20–30 KM), WITH DISTINCT COMMUNITIES ON EACH SIDE OF THE RIFT AND AT THE SOUTHWEST OF THE STUDY AREA. OUR RESULTS CONTRIBUTE TOWARD UNDERSTANDING THE DIVERSITY, BIOGEOGRAPHY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS OF THE RGR.

A NEW MACROINVERTEBRATE TRAIT-BASED INDEX, FLOW-T, DERIVED FROM ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONAL INFORMATION (FLOW VELOCITY PREFERENCES) CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR ALMOST 500 INVERTEBRATE TAXA AT THE EUROPEAN SCALE IS PRESENTED. THE INDEX WAS TESTED USING DATA FROM RIVERS SPANNING DIFFERENT BIOGEOGRAPHIC AND HYDRO-CLIMATIC REGIONS FROM THE UK, CYPRUS AND ITALY. THE PERFORMANCE OF FLOW-T AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ESTABLISHED UK FLOW ASSESSMENT TOOL, THE LOTIC-INVERTEBRATE INDEX FOR FLOW EVALUATION (LIFE), WAS ASSESSED TO DETERMINE THE TRANSFERABILITY OF THE APPROACH INTERNATIONALLY. FLOW-T WAS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH THE LIFE INDEX USING BOTH PRESENCE-ABSENCE AND ABUNDANCE WEIGHTED DATA FROM ALL STUDY AREAS (R VARYING FROM 0.46 TO 0.96). WHEN APPLIED AT THE RIVER REACH SCALE, FLOW-T WAS EFFECTIVE IN IDENTIFYING COMMUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH DISTINCT MESOHABITATS CHARACTERISED BY THEIR HYDRAULIC CHARACTERISTICS (E.G., POOLS, RIFFLES, GLIDES). FLOW-T CAN BE DERIVED USING BOTH PRESENCE/ABSENCE AND ABUNDANCE DATA AND CAN BE EASILY ADAPTED TO VARYING TAXONOMIC RESOLUTIONS.

FRAGMENTATION AND DEFAUNATION OF TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS AFFECT THE MAINTENANCE OF THEIR BIODIVERSITY IN A MYRIAD OF WAYS. OLD-GROWTH FOREST PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM LOCAL EXTINCTION, NOT ONLY BECAUSE FRAGMENTS FREQUENTLY REPRESENT LOW QUALITY HABITATS BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF BIOTIC INTERACTIONS SUCH AS SEED DISPERSAL. IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATED THE MAINTENANCE OF TREE SPECIES DIVERSITY IN THE FACE OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION IN SOUTHERN MEXICO USING DIFFERENT APPROACHES. FIRSTLY, WE USED COMMUNITY PHYLOGENY AT DIFFERENT TREE LIFE STAGES (I.E., SEEDS, SEEDLINGS AND ADULTS). SECONDLY, WE CATEGORISED PLANT SPECIES IN DIFFERENT LIFE STAGES INTO FUNCTIONAL GROUPS ACCORDING TO SEED SIZE (SMALL SEEDS < 1 CM LENGTH AND LARGE SEEDS > 1 CM LENGTH) AND, FINALLY, BY DISPERSAL SYNDROME (PREDOMINANTLY PRIMATE DISPERSED). WE SEARCHED FOR THREE SITES OF CONTINUOUS FOREST AS EXPERIMENTAL CONTROLS WHERE TWO IMPORTANT SEED DISPERSERS COEXIST, THE HOWLER (ALOUATTA PIGRA) AND SPIDER (ATELES GEOFFROYI) MONKEYS, AND SIX FOREST FRAGMENTS OF SIMILAR SIZES (CA. 3–6 HA). THREE FRAGMENTS WERE OCCUPIED ONLY BY HOWLER MONKEYS, AND THREE HAD NO PRIMATES. WE COMPARED ENTIRE ASSEMBLAGES AS WELL AS ASSEMBLAGES OF SMALL-SEEDED AND LARGE-SEEDED SPECIES SEPARATELY TO DETERMINE THE PHYLOGENETIC STRUCTURE AND PATTERNS OF SPECIES RICHNESS AND THE DENSITY OF ADULT TREES (> 10 CM DBH), SEEDLINGS (10–100 CM TALL) AND SEED ASSEMBLAGES. FRAGMENTS AND CONTINUOUS FOREST DIFFERED IN TAXONOMIC SPECIES RICHNESS AND DENSITY AT ALL LIFE STAGES WHEN LARGE-SEEDED SPECIES MAINLY DISPERSED BY PRIMATES WERE SOLELY CONSIDERED, WITH NUMBERS IN UNOCCUPIED FRAGMENTS BEING CONSISTENTLY LOWER THAN IN CONTINUOUS FORESTS AND OCCUPIED FRAGMENTS.

HOWEVER, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING (THE BEF RELATIONSHIP) IN OVEREXPLOITED ECOSYSTEMS REMAINS CONTROVERSIAL LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF VALIDATION IN NATURE. THEREFORE, IN THIS STUDY, THROUGH FOUR SEASONAL TRAWL SURVEYS OF DEMERSAL FISH ASSEMBLAGES OFF THE SHELF SEA OF SHANDONG PROVINCE, CHINA, WE EXPLORED BEF RELATIONSHIPS AND THEIR SEASONAL VARIABILITY. FURTHERMORE, WE ASSESSED THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND BIODIVERSITY ON BIOMASS VARIATIONS. LOCATION: SHELF SEA OF SHANDONG PROVINCE, CHINA. METHODS: AT EACH STATION, WE CALCULATED TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY INDICES, AND EXAMINED THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING BASED ON THE BIOMASS INDEX. MOREOVER, WE EXAMINED THE BIOMASS INDEX'S ASSOCIATION WITH TWO ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, SEA BOTTOM TEMPERATURE AND SEA SURFACE CHLOROPHYLL-A CONCENTRATION, TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN EXPLAINING CHANGES IN ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING. RESULTS: TWO TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY INDICES (SPECIES RICHNESS AND VARIANCE) AND TWO FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY INDICES (FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS AND FUNCTIONAL EVENNESS) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH BIOMASS IN AT LEAST ONE SEASON. HOWEVER, THE BEF RELATIONSHIPS WERE NOT CONSISTENT AMONG THE SEASONS, HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED TO CONSIDER SEASON-SPECIFIC BIODIVERSITY INDICES (E.G., FUNCTIONAL EVENNESS). SPECIFICALLY, DESPITE CONSISTENTLY SIGNIFICANT BEF RELATIONSHIPS IN THE FOUR SEASONS FOR SPECIES RICHNESS, VARIANCE, AND FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS, WE NOTED TEMPORALLY VARIABLE BEF RELATIONSHIPS FOR FUNCTIONAL EVENNESS. BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT AND BIODIVERSITY PRODUCED A STRONG SYNERGISTIC EFFECT ON BIOMASS, ALTHOUGH THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE VARIED AMONG SEASONS. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: BIODIVERSITY GREATLY CONTRIBUTES TO ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING, UNDERSCORING THE NEED TO ASSESS THE CONSEQUENCES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS ON ECOSYSTEMS USING INTEGRATED TAXONOMIC AND TRAIT-BASED APPROACHES.

WHILE UNCERTAINTY IN SUCH ANIMAL SURVEY DATA ARE INHERENTLY LARGE AND IT IS HARD TO GENERALIZE ACROSS A 795-KM2 AREA THAT ENCOMPASSES DIVERSE HABITAT TYPES, DATA SUGGEST AN INCREASE IN ANIMAL ABUNDANCE IN THE NATIONAL PARK. AN INCREASE IN PATROLLING EFFORT BY PARK GUARDS OVER THE DECADE WAS CORRELATED WITH A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF TRAPS AND SNARES FOUND, WHICH SUGGESTS PATROLLING HELPED LIMIT RESOURCE EXTRACTION FROM THE PARK. THE PARK’S EDGE WAS EXTENSIVELY USED FOR ILLEGAL FOREST PRODUCT EXTRACTION, WHILE THE SETTING OF SNARES OCCURRED MORE OFTEN DEEPER IN THE FOREST. PERHAPS COUNTER-INTUITIVELY, INCREASED COMMUNITY WEALTH OR PARK-RELATED EMPLOYMENT IN A VILLAGE NEXT TO THE PARK WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH INCREASED ILLEGAL FOREST PRODUCT EXTRACTION.

AS HUMAN SETTLEMENT AND ACTIVITY INCREASINGLY OVERLAP WITH BIG CAT HABITAT, THE FREQUENCY OF HUMAN CONFLICT OVER WILDLIFE IS RISING, OFTEN PRECIPITATING DIRECT COSTS TO PEOPLE LIVING NEAR BIG CATS. BIG CATS ARE RARE, THEY PLAY MANY CRITICAL ROLES IN THE ECOSYSTEMS THEY INHABIT, AND ARE OFTEN FLAGSHIP CONSERVATION SPECIES BECAUSE THEY ARE POSTER-CHARISMATIC MEGAFAUNA. AS MANY OF THE COSTS OF CONSERVATION ARE BORNE BY LOCALS, LOCAL ACCEPTANCE OF BIG CATS ON THE LANDSCAPE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE SUCCESS OF IN-SITU CONSERVATION OF THESE SPECIES. HERE, WE EXPLORE THIS ISSUE BY CONDUCTING A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW OF ARTICLES THAT DIRECTLY MEASURE LOCAL PERCEPTIONS (OR ACCEPTANCE) OF BIG CATS QUANTITATIVELY. WE NORMALIZED ALL PERCEPTION DATA SO WE COULD SYNTHESIZE RESULTS ACROSS PLACES AND SPECIES. THE FINAL SET OF DATA INCLUDED THE VIEWS OF 14 253 LOCALS FROM 45 PAPERS, INTERROGATING FIVE DIFFERENT QUESTION TYPES ON LOCAL PERCEPTIONS OF BIG CATS. ACROSS THESE STUDIES, WE FOUND THAT LOCALS GENERALLY HOLD NEUTRAL OR SLIGHTLY POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF BIG CATS – PARTICULARLY FOR TIGERS AND MOUNTAIN LIONS. ON AVERAGE, LIVESTOCK OWNERS HAVE MORE NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF BIG CATS COMPARED TO NON-LIVESTOCK OWNERS. GEOGRAPHICALLY, THERE ARE LARGE PORTIONS OF BIG CAT POPULATION RANGES WHERE NO RESEARCH ON LOCAL PERCEPTIONS EXIST. THESE RESULTS CALL FOR TWO THINGS (1) RETHINKING THE PERCEPTION THAT LOCALS LARGELY HOLD NEGATIVE VIEWS TOWARD BIG CATS ACROSS THEIR RANGES AND (2) MORE SYSTEMATIC RESEARCH ACROSS BIG CAT SPECIES RANGES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND LOCAL PERCEPTIONS, WHAT DRIVES THOSE PERCEPTIONS, AND HOW THEY IMPACT THE OUTCOMES OF CONSERVATION APPROACHES. © 2021 THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.",NA,NA,NA,"CORCORAN, W.; ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: WILLCORCORAN20@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1111/acv.12756,NA,13679430,ANIMAL CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,4,467-479,JOHN WILEY AND SONS INC,NA,SCOPUS,LIFE WITH BIG CATS: LOCAL PERCEPTIONS OF BIG CAT SPECIES,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119827098&doi=10.1111%2facv.12756&partnerID=40&md5=b1e35b88f6a3e408195b62d4e735dccc,25,2022,WE THANK OUR TWO ANONYMOUS REVIEWERS FOR THEIR TIME AND CONTINUED CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

KATHA IS USUALLY USED DURING THE WINTER SEASON WHEN THE WATER DEPTH DECREASES. HENCE, THIS EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED FROM NOVEMBER 2018 TO MARCH 2019 ON KATHA FISHING TO INVESTIGATE ITS STATUS AND IMPACTS ON FISHERIES RESOURCES OF THE SHARI-GOYAIN RIVER IN THE SYLHET DISTRICT OF BANGLADESH. THE STUDY WAS BASED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT KATHA FISHING MIGHT HAVE DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS TO FISH BIODIVERSITY AND PRODUCTION. DATA WERE OBTAINED THROUGH A QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED SURVEY, PERSONAL INTERVIEWS, CATCH ASSESSMENT (CA), FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, AND KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS. A TOTAL OF 54 SPECIES WERE DOCUMENTED, INCLUDING TWO EXOTIC FISH SPECIES (TILAPIA AND COMMON CARP) AND 3 SPECIES OF PRAWN DURING HARVESTING OF THE KATHAS. THE CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT (CPUE) (KG/GEAR/HA/PERSON/HOUR) WAS THE HIGHEST IN DECEMBER (1.13 ± 0.37), FOLLOWED BY NOVEMBER (1.06 ± 0.40), JANUARY (0.80 ± 0.25), FEBRUARY (0.71 ± 0.23), AND MARCH (0.52 ± 0.21). THE CATCH PER UNIT AREA (CPUA) (KG/HA) WAS THE HIGHEST IN NOVEMBER (264.66 ± 18.21), FOLLOWED BY DECEMBER (205.05 ± 27.77), JANUARY (175.02 ± 76.04), FEBRUARY (147.73 ± 52.11), AND MARCH (102.08 ± 41.04) WHERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES (P < 0.05) AMONG THE MONTHS WERE OBSERVED. AVERAGE CATCH PER KATHA IN A MONTH RANGED FROM 41.09 ± 16.11 TO 12.42 ± 5.89 KG, WITH A MEAN OF 24.29 ± 11.08 KG, AND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN AVERAGE CATCH WAS OBSERVED WITH THE PROGRESSION OF MONTHS. THE MOST SPECIES RICHNESS WAS NOTICED IN DECEMBER (38), FOLLOWED BY NOVEMBER (35), JANUARY (34), FEBRUARY (28), AND MARCH (25).

ACCORDING TO THE CA AND RESPONDENTS’ PERCEPTION, INDISCRIMINATE HARVESTING OF FISH BY KATHA FISHING CAN BE A CAUSE OF FISH BIODIVERSITY LOSS AS IT REDUCES OPEN WATER CATCHES, TOTAL PRODUCTION, AND DISTURBS THE ECOSYSTEM. FROM THE RESEARCH FINDINGS, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT KATHA FISHING SHOULD BE STOPPED FOR SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF FISHERIES RESOURCES IN THE SHARI-GOYAIN RIVER.

AS LANDSCAPE FRAGMENTATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE INCREASE, FIRES WILL BECOME MORE FREQUENT AND WIDESPREAD ACROSS TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS WORLDWIDE, WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR FOREST DYNAMICS BY ALTERING PLANT–ANIMAL INTERACTIONS. HERE WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT RECURRENT FIRES IN TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS CHANGE BOTTOM-UP AND TOP-DOWN FORCES CONTROLLING THE ABUNDANCE OF INSECT HERBIVORES, WHICH IN TURN INCREASES HERBIVORY. TO QUANTIFY HERBIVORY, WE COLLECTED 50 LEAVES PER TREE OF FIVE SPECIES IN BURNED AND UNBURNED EXPERIMENTAL PLOTS (N = 75) IN SOUTHEASTERN AMAZONIAN FORESTS. WE MEASURED LEAF NITROGEN CONTENT AND LEAF THICKNESS OF TREE LEAVES AS BOTTOM-UP FACTORS THAT COULD EXPLAIN DIFFERENCES IN HERBIVORY; WE MEASURED PREDATION PRESSURE ON MODEL CATERPILLARS AND ESTIMATED THE ABUNDANCE OF PREDATORY ANTS AS TOP-DOWN FACTORS. WE FOUND HIGHER HERBIVORY IN BURNED THAN IN UNBURNED FORESTS, AS WELL AS LOWER PREDATOR ATTACKS IN CATERPILLAR MODELS AND LOWER ABUNDANCE OF PREDATORY ANTS. LEAF NITROGEN CONTENT DID NOT VARY ACROSS TREATMENTS. BIRDS ATTACKED MODEL CATERPILLARS MORE FREQUENTLY IN BURNED THAN IN UNBURNED FORESTS, AND LEAF THICKNESS WAS HIGHER IN BURNED FORESTS, BUT THESE FACTORS TOGETHER WERE NOT ENOUGH TO OFFSET THE HIGHER HERBIVORY IN BURNED PLOTS. FIRE DEGRADES TROPICAL FORESTS NOT ONLY BY KILLING TREES AND ALTERING THEIR STRUCTURE AND COMMUNITY DYNAMICS, BUT ALSO BY REDUCING PREDATORY ARTHROPODS AND DISRUPTING PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS, WHICH TRIGGERS INCREASED HERBIVORY. THESE INDIRECT IMPACTS OF RECURRENT FIRES PROBABLY CONTRIBUTE TO FURTHER ALTER FOREST STRUCTURE, FUNCTIONING, AND TO DECREASE REGENERATION IN AMAZONIAN FORESTS.

TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THIS STUDY CAPTURED THE OBSERVATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN MALIPATI, A REMOTE AGRARIAN DRYLAND AREA IN THE CHIREDZI DISTRICT, ZIMBABWE. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO GATHER DETAILED INSIGHTS ABOUT PERCEIVED ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES USING THE EVIDENCE DRAWN FROM LOCAL AND INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS WHO HAVE CLOSE INTERACTIONS WITH THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. A HOUSEHOLD QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED SURVEY WITH RANDOMLY CHOSEN FARMERS (N = 116) REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS’ OBSERVATIONS OF CHANGES IN HYDROLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM WERE CONSISTENT WITH AVAILABLE EVIDENCE OF INCREASING TEMPERATURES AND LITTLE RAINFALL RECORDED IN THE DISTRICT. RESULTS ALSO SHOWED HIGH SENSITIVITY OF THE AREA TO CLIMATE CHANGE THAT MANIFEST IN VARIOUS INDICATORS: HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES IN RIVERS, STREAMS, SWAMPS, AND GROUND WATER; AND ECOLOGICAL CHANGES THROUGH THE BEHAVIOUR OF TREES, INSECTS, BIRDS, AND WILD ANIMALS. SEX AND AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS DID NOT INFLUENCE THE WAY THEY PERCEIVED MOST OF THESE CHANGES (P > 0.05). HOWEVER, EDUCATION AND THE PERIOD OF STAY IN THE AREA WERE RELATED TO THE RESPONDENTS’ PERCEIVED CHANGES IN RIVER FLOWS AND SILTATION, AND THE CONDITIONS OF SWAMPS (P < 0.05). OUR STUDY ALSO REVEALED DEEPER INSIGHTS ABOUT THE HUMAN-BIODIVERSITY INTERACTIONS IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN UNIQUE AREAS WHERE COMMUNITIES LIVE ALONGSIDE WILDLIFE. THE EVIDENCE DRAWN FROM LOCAL AND INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS CAN BE USED TO INFORM LOCAL-BASED SOLUTIONS TO THE GROWING PROBLEMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS.

THUS, WE ASSESSED HOW BODY CONDITION OF INDIVIDUAL BIRDS' CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO FOREST FRAGMENT ISOLATION. WE COMPARED WEIGHTS OF THE SAME INDIVIDUALLY BANDED BIRDS CAUGHT IN MIST NETS WITHIN 5 YEARS BEFORE AND AFTER FRAGMENT ISOLATION AND ASSESSED THE POPULATION-LEVEL CHANGES OF THREE SPECIES AT THE BIOLOGICAL DYNAMICS OF FOREST FRAGMENTS PROJECT IN THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON.

CONTRARY TO PREDICTIONS, INSECTIVOROUS SPECIES THAT REMAINED IN FRAGMENTS GAINED WEIGHT (3.43%) AFTER FRAGMENT ISOLATION WHILE FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS MAINTAINED A STABLE WEIGHT.

YET REGULATION FOR CONSERVATION AND HEALTH PURPOSES IS AT ODDS WITH THE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES PROVIDED BY THIS MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY. TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE WILDLIFE TRADE PERSISTS DESPITE ASSOCIATED BIODIVERSITY AND GLOBAL HEALTH THREATS, WE USED A BENEFIT–COST APPROACH USING SIMPLE CALCULATIONS TO COMPARE THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE WILDLIFE TRADE AT THE INDIVIDUAL, NATIONAL, AND GLOBAL SCALES TO THE COSTS OF COVID-19, SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS), AND EBOLA DISEASE ACROSS SCENARIOS OF EPIDEMIC FREQUENCY. FOR COVID-19, BENEFITS OF THE WILDLIFE TRADE OUTWEIGH COSTS AT INDIVIDUAL SCALES, BUT COSTS FAR EXCEED BENEFITS AT NATIONAL AND GLOBAL SCALES, PARTICULARLY IF EPIDEMICS WERE TO BECOME FREQUENT. FOR SARS AND EBOLA, BENEFITS OUTWEIGH COSTS AT ALL SCALES, EXCEPT IF EBOLA-LIKE EPIDEMICS WERE TO BECOME FREQUENT. THE WILDLIFE TRADE PRODUCES NET BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON WILDLIFE FOR FOOD AND INCOME BUT INCURS NET COSTS ON STAKEHOLDERS AT LARGER SCALES FROM INCREASED EPIDEMIC RISK.

HOWEVER, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS ARE BEING ABANDONED WORLDWIDE DUE TO CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE AND RESOURCE USE, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN A DRASTIC DECLINE IN GRASSLAND-DEPENDENT SPECIES. SKI PISTES CAN FUNCTION AS IMPORTANT HABITATS FOR VARIOUS GRASSLAND FLORA AND FAUNA, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY CLOSED BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND POPULATION DECLINE.

INCREASING MONITORING OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND THE BREADTH OF THE CHANGES IN BIODIVERSITY, ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING AND PROPOSE MORE EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION STRATEGIES. SUCH STRATEGIES SHOULD NOT ONLY FOCUS ON MAXIMIZING THE NUMBER OF SPECIES (I.E., TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY) BUT ALSO THE DIVERSITY OF PHYLOGENETIC HISTORIES AND ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS WITHIN COMMUNITIES. TO SUPPORT FUTURE CONSERVATION DECISIONS, MULTICOMPONENT BIODIVERSITY MONITORING CAN BE COMBINED WITH HIGH-THROUGHPUT SPECIES ASSEMBLAGE DETECTION METHODS SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL DNA (EDNA) METABARCODING. HERE, WE USED EDNA TO ASSESS FISH BIODIVERSITY ALONG THE COAST OF SOUTHERN BRITTANY (FRANCE, IROISE SEA). WE FILTERED SURFACE MARINE WATER FROM 17 SAMPLING STATIONS AND APPLIED AN EDNA METABARCODING APPROACH TARGETING ACTINOPTERYGII AND ELASMOBRANCHII TAXA. WE DOCUMENTED THREE COMPLEMENTARY BIODIVERSITY COMPONENTS—TAXONOMIC, PHYLOGENETIC, AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY—AND THREE DIVERSITY FACETS—RICHNESS, DIVERGENCE AND REGULARITY. WE IDENTIFIED A NORTH/SOUTH CONTRAST WITH HIGHER DIVERSITY FOR THE THREE FACETS OF THE BIODIVERSITY COMPONENTS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STUDY AREA. THE NORTHERN COMMUNITIES SHOWED HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS, STRONGER PHYLOGENETIC OVERDISPERSION AND LOWER FUNCTIONAL CLUSTERING COMPARED TO THE ONES IN THE SOUTHERN PART, DUE TO THE HIGHER DIVERSITY OF HABITATS (REEFS, ROCKY SHORES) AND RESTRICTED ACCESS FOR FISHING. MOREOVER, WE ALSO DETECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF TAXONOMIC, PHYLOGENETIC, AND FUNCTIONAL UNIQUENESS IN MANY OFFSHORE STATIONS COMPARED TO MORE COASTAL ONES, WITH THE PRESENCE OF SPECIES TYPICALLY LIVING AT GREATER DEPTHS (> 300 M), WHICH SUGGESTS AN INFLUENCE OF HYDRODYNAMIC STRUCTURES AND CURRENTS ON EDNA DISPERSION AND HENCE SAMPLE COMPOSITION.

POPULATION DYNAMICS OF AMPHIBIANS CAN RESULT FROM PROCESSES ACTING AT DIFFERENT SCALES. BOTH THE LOCAL CHARACTERISTICS OF BREEDING WETLANDS AND THE FEATURES OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE CAN STRONGLY AFFECT THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF AMPHIBIAN POPULATIONS. EUROPEAN NEWTS ARE PARTICULARLY THREATENED BY LAND-USE CHANGE AND INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES. WHILE IT IS KNOWN THAT NEWTS ARE DECLINING ACROSS EUROPE, FEW STUDIES HAVE PERFORMED BROAD-SCALE ASSESSMENTS OF THEIR DECLINE, EITHER BECAUSE ABUNDANCE DYNAMICS ARE MORE COMPLEX TO ANALYSE THAN PRESENCE/ABSENCE DATA OR BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE A HIGH SAMPLING EFFORT AND LONG-TERM MONITORING. IN THIS STUDY, WE SHOW THAT LONG-TERM DISTRIBUTION DATA CAN BE COMBINED WITH DEMOGRAPHIC MODELS TO QUANTIFY THE DECLINE IN ABUNDANCE OF NEWT SPECIES AT THE REGIONAL SCALE, AND TO ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF MULTIPLE FACTORS IN DETERMINING ABUNDANCE DYNAMICS. WE PERFORMED MULTIPLE SURVEYS BETWEEN 1996 AND 2020 AND USED N-MIXTURE MODELS IN A BAYESIAN FRAMEWORK. WE THEN CALCULATED ABUNDANCE CHANGES BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THE LAST SAMPLING SEASON, WHICH WERE PERFORMED WITH AN AVERAGE TIMESPAN OF 13 YEARS ACROSS ALL WETLANDS. BOTH ITALIAN CRESTED NEWTS AND SMOOTH NEWTS SHOWED LARGE DECLINES, WITH AN AVERAGE ESTIMATED ABUNDANCE LOSS BETWEEN THE FIRST AND LAST SAMPLING SEASON OF 57% AND 63%, RESPECTIVELY. LOCAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WETLANDS WERE THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF ABUNDANCE DYNAMICS: THE ABUNDANCE OF BOTH SPECIES SHOWED A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AREA AND THE PERMANENCE OF THE WETLAND AND A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESENCE OF FISH. ADDITIONALLY, THE ABUNDANCE OF ITALIAN CRESTED NEWTS WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE PRESENCE OF INVASIVE CRAYFISH. NO RELATIONSHIP WAS DETECTED BETWEEN ABUNDANCE AND TERRESTRIAL HABITAT AVAILABILITY OR CONNECTIVITY MEASURES. DESPITE UNCERTAINTIES IN THE ABSOLUTE VALUES OF ESTIMATED ABUNDANCE, THE STRIKING REGIONAL-SCALE DECLINE OF NEWTS IS EVIDENT. AMONG THE MAJOR DETERMINANTS OF POPULATION DYNAMICS, FISH AND CRAYFISH PRESENCE INCREASED THEIR PREVALENCE IN THE STUDY AREA, WHILE OTHER FACTORS REMAINED MORE STABLE. MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AIMED AT ERADICATING OR CONTROLLING INVASIVE FISH AND CRAYFISH MIGHT HALT ABUNDANCE LOSS AND EVEN REVERT THIS DECLINING TREND.

WHILE THE SOCIOECOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES SUCH AS PALM OIL, COCOA AND COFFEE ARE WELL STUDIED, THE EFFECTS FOR COMMODITIES SUCH AS CASHEW (ANACARDIUM OCCIDENTALE) HAVE RECEIVED LESS ATTENTION. GLOBAL CULTIVATED AREA FOR CASHEW INCREASED RAPIDLY FROM 526,250 HA IN 1980 TO ~5.9 MILLION HA IN 2018. INDIA IS THE WORLD’S SECOND LARGEST CASHEW PRODUCER, WITH CASHEW FARMS OFTEN OCCURRING ADJACENT TO REMNANT FORESTS. TO MITIGATE DEFORESTATION FOR CASHEW EXPANSION, IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND PRESENT-DAY LAND USE POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT DRIVE THIS EXPANSION. THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS (N = 65) AND A LITERATURE REVIEW ON AGRICULTURAL POLICIES IN INDIA, WE EVALUATED THE ROLE OF STATE-LED LAND USE POLICIES IN CASHEW EXPANSION AND CHARACTERISED PRESENT-DAY CASHEW FARMING SYSTEMS IN THE SAWANTWADI-DODAMARG LANDSCAPE IN INDIA. AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES INTRODUCED FROM 1980S TO 1990S ENCOURAGED CULTIVAR CASHEW EXPANSION AND INFLUENCED LAND USE CONVERSION FROM RICE AND PRIVATELY OWNED FOREST TO CASHEW. FARMERS PREFERRED CULTIVAR CASHEW AS THEY PRODUCED HIGHER YIELDS FASTER, ALTHOUGH THEY REQUIRED MORE AGROCHEMICAL INPUTS AND WERE SUSCEPTIBLE TO PESTS AND WILDLIFE DEPREDATION. ABOUT 80% OF FARMERS HAD PLANTED CASHEW FARMS BY CLEARING FORESTS IN THE PAST 30 YEARS AND EXPRESSED INTEREST TO CONTINUE THE SAME. FARMERS AVOIDED APPLYING FOR GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED COMPENSATION FOR CROP LOSSES DUE TO WILDLIFE DEPREDATION AND CHOSE INSTEAD TO EXPAND CULTIVAR CASHEW INTO FORESTED AREAS. OUR STUDY DEEPENS THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW GOVERNMENT-LED AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES DRIVE FARMERS’ UPTAKE OF CASHEW CULTIVARS, FARMERS’ CASHEW MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, AND HOW THESE FACTORS DRIVE DEFORESTATION IN THIS LANDSCAPE AT THE STATE AND FARM LEVEL. WE RECOMMEND FURTHER RESEARCH WITH EQUITABLE STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION IN CASHEW FARMING SYSTEMS TO DEVISE SOUND PLANNING FOR FOREST CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS FOR THE CASHEW INDUSTRY.

SPATIAL ANALYSIS INDICATED RANGE CONTRACTIONS OF 57.7% (T. MACROSTOMUS) AND 69.0% (T. BRACHYDACTYLUS). DEFAUNATION RATES AND SPECIES ABUNDANCES IN PAS WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE OUTSIDE PAS. POACHING, LIVESTOCK, AND SOLID WASTE WERE THE PREDOMINANT THREATS. ANALYSIS OF ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY INDICATED THAT STRICT-USE SITES HAD GREATER BIOTIC INDEX AND HABITAT ASSESSMENT SCORES COMPARED TO MULTI-USE SITES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DESPITE BENEFITS OF GREATER ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY IN STRICT-USE PAS, PROTECTION TYPE HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON THE CONSERVATION OF AQUATIC SPECIES BY ITSELF. PROTECTED AREAS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE WITHOUT BETTER MANAGEMENT OF THE TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN CULTURAL ACTIVITIES AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. FOR PA NETWORKS TO BE OF BETTER CONSERVATION VALUE FOR AQUATIC BIODIVERSITY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD, THEY SHOULD BE COMMUNITY-ORIENTED AND CONNECT HIGH-QUALITY HABITATS, WITH THEIR BORDERS DEFINED BY CATCHMENTS. © 2022, THE AUTHOR(S).",NA,NA,BONSE,"WATSON, A.S.; FIELD CONSERVATION DEPARTMENT, 2300 STEELE STREET, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: A.WATSON029@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1007/s10531-022-02406-9,"NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETYNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY, NGS, EC-352 C-18",9603115,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,7,1847-1866,SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,ARE PROTECTED AREAS WORKING FOR ENDANGERED FROGS IN THE PERUVIAN ANDES?,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131565689&doi=10.1007%2fs10531-022-02406-9&partnerID=40&md5=7c43f2c760851905413f216e01d719c0,31,2022,"WE THANK OSCAR DAMIÁN BALDEÓN, WINY ARIAS LOPEZ, AUSTIN FITZGERALD, AND NUMEROUS VOLUNTEERS FOR THEIR HELP WITH FIELD SAMPLING; ROBERTO ELIAS AND ROGGER ANGEL MORENO LINO FOR LOGISTICAL SUPPORT; CESAR AGUILAR FOR PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE SCIENTIFIC COLLECTION AND PROVIDING SUGGESTIONS THAT IMPROVED THE PROJECT; DAVID SCHIEL, MIKE HICKFORD, AND JON HARDING FOR HELPFUL COMMENTS; THREE ANONYMOUS REFEREES AND EDITOR CLINTON JENKINS FOR COMMENTS THAT IMPROVED THE MANUSCRIPT; AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES IN THE JUNÍN AND PASCO PROVINCES.

IN THIS FRAMEWORK OF BIODIVERSITY DECLINE, ORGANISMS THAT PROVIDE BIOGENIC HABITAT PLAY A RELEVANT ROLE BY THEIR CAPACITY TO STRUCTURE ASSEMBLAGES AND INFLUENCE ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES. THE MEDITERRANEAN MUSSEL MYTILUS GALLOPROVINCIALIS IS CONSIDERED AN ECOSYSTEM ENGINEER BECAUSE IT ALTERS LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS MAINTAINING HABITAT SUITABILITY FOR OTHER ORGANISMS, AND ENHANCING LOCAL BIODIVERSITY. ALTHOUGH IT IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED THAT MUSSEL BEDS INCREASE DIVERSITY, THE DRIVERS SHAPING THESE ASSEMBLAGES ARE POORLY EXPLORED. WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER MUSSEL SIZE HOMOGENISATION SHAPES THE ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS AND STRUCTURE OF MACROBENTHIC ASSEMBLAGES ASSOCIATED WITH MUSSEL BEDS IN TWO SHORES OF THE GALICIAN COAST (NW SPAIN). AT EACH SHORE, TWO SITES, 10 M APART, WERE SELECTED AND AT EACH SITE, FAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES WERE COMPARED BETWEEN MUSSEL CLUMPS SHOWING SHELLS OF VARIOUS SIZES (CONTROL), AND MUSSEL CLUMPS WITH CLOSELY SIMILAR-SIZED MUSSELS, CONSIDERED AS HOMOGENISED. HOMOGENISED CLUMPS SHOWED, IN GENERAL, HIGHER VALUES IN TOTAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND SPECIES THAN CONTROL CLUMPS. REGARDING THE EFFECT OF MUSSEL SIZE HOMOGENISATION ON THE MULTIVARIATE STRUCTURE OF THE ASSEMBLAGES, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONTROL AND HOMOGENISED CLUMPS WERE FOUND IN THREE OUT OF THE FOUR SITES. MOST RELEVANT ASSOCIATED SPECIES USUALLY REACHED HIGHER ABUNDANCES IN HOMOGENISED CLUMPS THAN CONTROL ONES. THEREFORE, MUSSEL SIZE HOMOGENISATION INFLUENCED THE STRUCTURE OF THE MACROFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ASSOCIATED WITH MUSSEL BEDS BUT, ITS EFFECT WAS CONTEXT DEPENDENT (I.E., VARIED WITH SITES). INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPECIES CONTRIBUTION TO DISSIMILARITIES AMONG HOMOGENISED AND CONTROL CLUMPS WAS PROVIDED AND THE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF SEDIMENT AND ALGAE ON MUSSEL CLUMPS WAS DISCUSSED. © 2022 VEIGA ET AL.

SCI.,0,"THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYSE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PIG PRODUCTION BASED ON A DIET CONTAINING YEAST AS A PROTEIN SOURCE. THE YEAST IS PRODUCED FROM SUGAR, AND THE SUGAR CAN BE PRODUCED FROM HYDROLYSED WOOD THROUGH A BIOREFINERY PROCESS. THIS STUDY INCLUDED YEAST FROM TWO DIFFERENT BIOREFINERY PROCESSES: 1) A DOMESTIC DEMO PLANT IN CONNECTION WITH A COMPLEX BIOREFINERY, AND 2) A SMALL-SCALE WOOD REFINERY PROCESS LARGELY BASED ON WOOD RESIDUES. IN THE YEAST DIETS, THE YEAST REPLACED SOYBEAN MEAL AS A PROTEIN SOURCE AND THE TWO YEAST DIETS WERE COMPARED WITH A STANDARD DIET. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM THE PIG PRODUCTION SYSTEMS WERE ASSESSED BY USING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA), AND THE FUNCTIONAL UNIT WAS 1 KG CARCASS WEIGHT OF PORK AT THE FARM GATE. THE RESULTS FROM THE STUDY SHOW THAT YEAST REPLACING IMPORTED FEED PROTEIN SOURCES USED IN PIG PRODUCTION GIVES A LOWER IMPACT FOR BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING LAND USE CHANGE. THE LOWER IMPACT WAS CREATED BY THE REPLACEMENT OF SOYBEAN MEAL WITH YEAST FROM WOOD SUGAR IN THE FEED RECIPE. ALSO, THE SCENARIOS WITH YEAST DIETS GAVE A LAND USE RATIO BELOW 1, INDICATING AN IMPROVED LAND USE EFFICIENCY REGARDING PRODUCING HUMAN DIGESTIBLE PROTEIN. EVEN THOUGH THE FOREST LAND USED FOR DERIVING WOOD SUGAR CONSTITUTES A GREATER AREA THAN THE CORRESPONDING AREA FOR SOYBEAN MEAL PRODUCTION, THE FOREST LAND DOES NOT OCCUPY AREAS SUITABLE FOR FOOD PRODUCTION. THE REFERENCE CASE, REPRESENTING CURRENT PIG PRODUCTION AND FEEDING SYSTEM, HAD A LAND USE RATIO OF 1.15, MEANING THAT THE FEED PRODUCTION WAS DIRECTLY COMPETING FOR THE AREA SUITABLE FOR FOOD PRODUCTION. THE OVERALL CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE UTILISATION OF YEAST FROM WOOD SUGAR APPEARS TO AVOID FEED-FOOD COMPETITION AND AT THE SAME TIME TO BE AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION FOR FUTURE FEED PROTEIN EMPLOYED IN PIG PRODUCTION. © 2022",104925,"CELLULOSE, 61991-22-8, 68073-05-2, 9004-34-6; HEMICELLULOSE, 63100-39-0, 63100-40-3, 9034-32-6; LIGNIN, 9005-53-2; MOLASSES, 68476-78-8; NITROGEN, 7727-37-9; RAPESEED OIL, 8002-13-9; XYLOSE, 25990-60-7, 58-86-6",NA,"MØLLER, H.; NORWEGIAN INSTITUTE FOR SUSTAINABILITY RESEARCHNORWAY; EMAIL: HAM@NORSUS.NO",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.livsci.2022.104925,"237841/030 295189 NORGES FORSKNINGSRÅDNORGES FORSKNINGSRÅD, 233685/E50",18711413,LIVESTOCK SCIENCE,ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,LOCAL NON-FOOD YEAST PROTEIN IN PIG PRODUCTION–ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND LAND USE EFFICIENCY,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130285213&doi=10.1016%2fj.livsci.2022.104925&partnerID=40&md5=328574294b773d467724bb9b3584dace,260,2022,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE PROJECT LIVESTOCK – SUSTAINABLE LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION UNDER THE NORWEGIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL PROGRAMME BIONÆR - SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION IN FOOD AND BIO-BASED INDUSTRIES (GRANT NO. 295189).

AMONG THE MANY FACTORS IMPLICATED IN THE ONGOING LOSS OF AMPHIBIAN BIODIVERSITY ARE CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE DISEASE CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS, CAUSED BY THE FUNGUS BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS (BD). THESE THREATS ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE BD HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE DECLINES OF AT LEAST 43 FROG SPECIES, AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS EMERGING AS AN ADDITIONAL THREAT. WE EXPLORE HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS LIKELY TO AFFECT THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF AUSTRALIAN FROG SPECIES AND BD TO THE YEAR 2100, AND HOW THE SPATIAL AND CLIMATIC NICHE OVERLAP BETWEEN CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS-DECLINED FROGS AND BD COULD SHIFT. LOCATION: AUSTRALIA. METHODS: WE USED SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELLING TO INFER THE CURRENT AND FUTURE DISTRIBUTION OF 141 AUSTRALIAN FROG SPECIES AND BD, UNDER TWO EMISSIONS SCENARIOS. WE USED VARIOUS METRICS OF NICHE SIMILARITY TO QUANTIFY PREDICTED ALTERATIONS TO SPATIAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BD AND FROG SPECIES. RESULTS: CLIMATE CHANGE IS LIKELY TO HAVE A VARIABLE IMPACT ON FROG DISTRIBUTIONS IN AUSTRALIA, WITH SOME 23 AND 47 SPECIES, PRIMARILY IN SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA, PREDICTED TO LOSE AT LEAST 30% OF THEIR CURRENT DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER LOW AND HIGH EMISSIONS SCENARIOS, RESPECTIVELY. IN CONTRAST, 69 AND 68 SPECIES, RESPECTIVELY, HAVE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS, PRIMARILY IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA. WHILE THE DISTRIBUTION OF BD IS PREDICTED TO DECREASE, THE PROPORTIONAL SPATIAL AND NICHE OVERLAP BETWEEN BD AND SUSCEPTIBLE FROG SPECIES IS PREDICTED TO REMAIN LITTLE CHANGED, AND IN SOME CASES, TO INCREASE. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH EFFECTS WILL BE VARIABLE ACROSS THE CONTINENT, CLIMATE CHANGE IS LIKELY TO BE A THREATENING FACTOR TO MANY AUSTRALIAN FROG SPECIES. ADDITIONALLY, CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO MANY FROG SPECIES, AS ANY REDUCTIONS TO THE PATHOGEN'S DISTRIBUTION LARGELY COINCIDE WITH GEOGRAPHIC RANGE CONTRACTIONS OF CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS-SUSCEPTIBLE SPECIES. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

IN THE FACE OF HABITAT LOSS AND CLIMATE UNCERTAINTY, LARGE-SCALE NETWORKS OF PROTECTED AREAS CONNECTED BY CORRIDORS ARE NEEDED TO INCREASE THE DISPERSAL AND PERSISTENCE POTENTIAL OF BIOTA. FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECENT EUROPEAN BIODIVERSITY STRATEGY FOR 2030 DEFINES CLEAR TARGETS FOR IDENTIFYING, ESTABLISHING AND INTEGRATING ECOLOGICAL CORRIDORS, AS PART OF A TRANS-EUROPEAN NATURE NETWORK. HERE, WE EXAMINED WHETHER RIVERS COULD SERVE AS SUCH CORRIDORS, FACILITATING LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY (I.E. EXTENT TO WHICH LANDSCAPE FACILITATES OR IMPEDES SPECIES MOVEMENT, EXCHANGE OF GENES, NATAL DISPERSAL AND METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS) AMONG PROTECTED AREAS HOSTED WITHIN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN THE BALKAN PENINSULA, SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE. TO QUANTITATIVELY ADDRESS THIS QUESTION, WE CALCULATED THE PROPORTION OF THE RIVER NETWORK ENCLOSED WITHIN A PROTECTED AREA PER COUNTRY TO DETECT PATTERNS OF PROTECTION COVERAGE AND EXPLORED THE DEGREE TO WHICH SPATIAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN 1878 PROTECTED AREAS ARE SUPPORTED BY THE RIVER NETWORK. ACKNOWLEDGING THAT DAMS HINDER INSTREAM CONTINUITY, WE FURTHER QUANTIFIED POTENTIAL LOSS OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PROTECTED AREAS CAUSED BY THE EXISTENCE OF ALREADY IMPLEMENTED OR PLANNED DAM PROJECTS UPON CRITICAL RIVER HABITATS OF ENDANGERED FISH SPECIES. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THAT BALKAN RIVERS HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL IN PROVIDING THE SPATIAL CONNECTIONS NEEDED TO ESTABLISH LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN MOST OF PROTECTED AREAS IN THE REGION. STILL, HEEDLESS HYDROPOWER GROWTH AND DISSIMILARITIES IN RIVER PROTECTION BETWEEN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES REMAIN KEY CHALLENGES FOR THE EVOLUTION OF A RELATIVE FRAMEWORK.

WE STUDIED THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF MOWING ON THE ARTHROPOD FAUNA OF ROADSIDE GRASSLAND, WHICH MIGHT SERVE AS POTENTIAL HABITAT FOR INSECTS TO PREVENT THEIR LOCAL EXTINCTION AND AS CORRIDOR FOR THE DISPERSAL IN ANTHROPOGENIC LANDSCAPES. IN ADDITION, WE STUDIED IF LOSSES DUE TO MOWING CAN BE MITIGATED BY THE USE OF ‘ARTHROPOD-FRIENDLY’ MOWING TECHNIQUE. IN AGREEMENT WITH EARLIER STUDIES, WE FOUND THAT MOWING WITH A CONVENTIONAL MOWING HEAD (MK 1200 FROM MULAG) CAUSED CONSIDERABLE LOSSES IN ARTHROPODS, RANGING FROM 29% FOR HETEROPTERA OVER AROUND 50% IN ARANEAE, CICADINA, HYMENOPTERA AND DIPTERA, UP TO 73% FOR HOLOMETABOLOUS LARVAE, AND 87% FOR LEPIDOPTERA. THESE LOSSES BY MOWING WERE FULLY OFFSET FOR ARANEAE, CICADINA, HETEROPTERA, LEPIDOPTERA AND LARVAE OF HOLOMETABOLOUS INSECTS WHEN USING THE MOWING HEAD ECO 1200 FROM MULAG, WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO BE ‘ARTHROPOD-FRIENDLY’. FOR HYMENOPTERA AND DIPTERA, THE LOSSES WERE REDUCED BY 15% AND 25% RESPECTIVELY. FOR SALTATORIA AND COLEOPTERA, WE DID NOT FIND ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ALL TREATMENTS. THESE DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT MOWING OF ROADSIDES WITH CONVENTIONAL MOWING TECHNOLOGY HAS A HIGHLY DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE GRASSLAND ARTHROPOD FAUNA. HOWEVER, THIS EFFECT CAN BE OFFSET OR AT LEAST MITIGATED BY THE USE OF ‘ARTHROPOD-FRIENDLY’ MOWING TECHNIQUE.

WE ADAPTED A STRUCTURED DECISION-MAKING PRIORITIZATION TOOL TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL BIODIVERSITY BENEFITS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGES.

DETERMINING THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE MAINTENANCE OF ESTUARINE BIODIVERSITY, ESPECIALLY THAT OF FISH, IS VITAL FOR PROMOTING ESTUARINE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY. WE USED ENVIRONMENTAL DNA METABARCODING ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE FISH SPECIES COMPOSITION IN 22 ESTUARIES AROUND JAPAN AND MEASURED WATERSHED-SCALE LAND-USE FACTORS (E.G., POPULATION SIZE, URBAN AREA PERCENTAGE, AND FOREST AREA PERCENTAGE). WE SOUGHT TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE RICHNESS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE ESTUARINE FISH SPECIES (I.E., REGISTERED BY THE JAPANESE MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE NATIONAL SPECIES RED-LIST) IS DETERMINED BY WATERSHED-SCALE LAND-USE FACTORS. THE RICHNESS OF SUCH SPECIES WAS GREATER, WHERE FOREST COVER WAS HIGHEST; THUS, FOREST COVER CONTRIBUTES TO THEIR CONSERVATION. THE PROPORTION OF AGRICULTURE COVER WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW SPECIES RICHNESS OF RED-LISTED FISHES (REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS, ADJUSTED R2 = 43.9% OF TOTAL VARIANCE, DF = 5, F = 5.3843, P = 0.0001). THE NUMBER OF RED-LISTED SPECIES INCREASED FROM 3 TO 11 ALONG A WATERSHED LAND-USE GRADIENT RANGING FROM A HIGH PROPORTION OF AGRICULTURE COVER TO A LARGE PROPORTION OF FOREST COVER. FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THROUGHOUT JAPAN ALL THE EXAMINED WATERSHEDS THAT WERE COVERED BY &GT;74.8% FOREST HAD MORE THAN THE AVERAGE (6.7 SPECIES PER SITE) RICHNESS OF RED-LISTED FISH SPECIES. THIS RESULT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ALREADY HIGH AVERAGE FOREST COVER IN JAPAN OF 67.2%. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE HOW THE LAND USE OF WATERSHEDS CAN AFFECT THE COASTAL SEA ENVIRONMENT AND ITS BIODIVERSITY AND SUGGEST THAT PROPER FOREST MANAGEMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH LAND-USE MANAGEMENT MAY BE OF PRIME IMPORTANCE FOR THREATENED FISH SPECIES AND COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS IN GENERAL. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

GROWING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT INVESTIGATING FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY BEYOND PURELY TAXONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS MAY PROVIDE DIFFERENT BUT COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ABOUT COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY. HOWEVER, SUCH MULTIFACETED STUDIES ON COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY FROM BOTH FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC PERSPECTIVES ARE RARE IN THE CONTEXT OF FISH ASSEMBLAGES IN LAKES. WE EXAMINED PATTERNS OF FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC ALPHA DIVERSITY IN FISHES AND EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE PATTERNS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS ACROSS BROAD ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS IN 30 SHALLOW LAKES. FURTHERMORE, WE EXAMINED COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY MECHANISMS USING NULL MODELS TO QUANTIFY THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DETERMINISTIC AND STOCHASTIC ASSEMBLY PROCESSES. OUR RESULTS REVEALED NO CLEAR PATTERNS AMONG MULTIPLE BIODIVERSITY COMPONENTS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS, AND NO SINGLE COMPONENT COULD BE USED AS A RELIABLE PROXY FOR ANOTHER; THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ACCOUNTING FOR FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY CAN HELP TO EXPLAIN FISH COMMUNITY VARIATION. NULL MODELS REVEALED THAT BOTH DETERMINISTIC AND STOCHASTIC ASSEMBLY PROCESSES OCCURRED SIMULTANEOUSLY, WITH STOCHASTIC PROCESSES BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF FISH COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY PROCESSES IN MOST OF OUR STUDY LAKES. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF EVALUATING BOTH FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC ALPHA DIVERSITY WHEN IDENTIFYING PATTERNS OF COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY. © 2021, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG.",NA,NA,NA,"CHEN, Y.; LABORATORY OF BIOLOGICAL INVASION AND ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION, 7 DONGHU SOUTH ROAD, HUBEI, CHINA; EMAIL: CHENYF@IHB.AC.CN",ARTICLE,10.1007/s11160-021-09688-2,"KLPA2013-01, KLPA2016-01, KLPA2017-01 NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA, NSFC, 31720103905 MAJOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM FOR WATER POLLUTION CONTROL AND TREATMENTMAJOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM FOR WATER POLLUTION CONTROL AND TREATMENT, 2017ZX07302-002",9603166,REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES,ENGLISH,NA,NA,4,2,623-644,SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA DEUTSCHLAND GMBH,NA,SCOPUS,UNRAVELLING FISH COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY IN SHALLOW LAKES: INSIGHTS FROM FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118127948&doi=10.1007%2fs11160-021-09688-2&partnerID=40&md5=1bf06fadf9fd610812aeb20d4e74769e,32,2022,THIS RESEARCH WAS FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (GRANT NO. 31720103905); THE MAJOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM FOR WATER POLLUTION CONTROL AND TREATMENT (GRANT NO. 2017ZX07302-002); AND THE KEY LABORATORY OF PLATEAU AQUATIC ORGANISM AND ENVIRONMENT OF QINGHAI PROVINCE (GRANT NO.

LARGE-SCALE DISTURBANCES SUCH AS HABITAT LOSS, FRAGMENTATION AND DEGRADATION ARE KNOWN TO HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR NATIVE BIOTA, BUT THE EFFECTS OF SMALL-SCALE DISTURBANCES SUCH AS SELECTIVE LOGGING ARE LESS WELL KNOWN. WE COMPARED THREE SITES WITH DIFFERENT REGIMES OF SELECTIVE LOGGING PERFORMED BY INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES IN THE SOUTH AMERICAN TEMPERATE RAINFOREST, TO ASSESS EFFECTS ON THE DENSITY AND HABITAT SELECTION PATTERNS OF THE NEAR THREATENED ENDEMIC ARBOREAL MARSUPIAL DROMICIOPS GLIROIDES. WE USED STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS OF WOOD EXTRACTION, WHICH WAS 0.22-2.55 M3 PER HA PER YEAR. IN THE LESS DISTURBED SITE ONLY TWO TREE SPECIES WERE LOGGED, IN THE INTERMEDIATELY DISTURBED SITES EIGHT SPECIES WERE LOGGED AT LOW INTENSITY, AND IN THE MOST DISTURBED SITE SEVEN SPECIES WERE LOGGED INTENSIVELY. THE SITE WITH INTERMEDIATE DISTURBANCE HAD THE HIGHEST FLESHY-FRUITED PLANT DIVERSITY AND FRUIT BIOMASS VALUES AS A RESULT OF THE PROLIFERATION OF SHADE-INTOLERANT PLANTS. THIS SITE ALSO HAD THE HIGHEST DENSITY OF D. GLIROIDES. THESE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH CONNELL'S INTERMEDIATE DISTURBANCE HYPOTHESIS, SUGGESTING THAT COEXISTENCE OF PEOPLE WITH NATURE IS POSSIBLE IF WOOD EXTRACTION VOLUMES ARE MODERATE, INCREASING PLANT DIVERSITY.

ENVIRON. SCI.,1,"ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES ARE ONE OF THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT DRIVE BIODIVERSITY LOSS. TEMPORAL CHANGES IN BIODIVERSITY RESPOND TO SUCH DISTURBANCES. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE TEMPORAL CHANGES IN TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF FISH ASSEMBLAGES IN DIFFERENT HABITATS (THREE GORGES RESERVOIR, TGR; RUNNING WATER ABOVE THE TGR, UTGR; AND TRIBUTARY CHISHUI RIVER, CSR) IN THE UPPER YANGTZE BASIN AFTER IMPOUNDMENT OF THE TGR FROM 2008 TO 2015. DURING THE SURVEY, THE TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OF FISH ASSEMBLAGES VARIED AMONG THE HABITATS. ALTHOUGH TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY INCREASED AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE ENTIRE UPPER YANGTZE BASIN, NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE DIVERSITIES WERE OBSERVED IN EACH HABITAT. THE HABITATS SHOWED DIRECTIONAL CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF FISH SPECIES. THE SLOPE OF THE DIRECTIONAL CHANGES IN THE TGR WAS MORE THAN THAT IN THE UTGR AND CSR. THESE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF FISH SPECIES WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HABITAT AFTER THE IMPOUNDMENT. THE ASSEMBLY OF THE FISH ASSEMBLAGE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE NEUTRAL PROCESS IN THE ENTIRE SURVEY AREA BUT WAS PROMOTED BY A COMBINATION OF SPECIES SORTING AND NEUTRAL PROCESS IN EACH HABITAT. THE IMPOUNDMENT CAUSED MORE EFFECTS ON THE TGR THAN ON THE UTGR, BUT IT SLIGHTLY AFFECTED THE CSR. REGARDING FISHING CLOSURE, CONSERVATION MEASURES FOR FISH DIVERSITY SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT HABITATS. THE STUDY FINDINGS SUGGEST THE REMOVAL OF SMALL DAMS IN TRIBUTARIES AND ECOLOGICAL REGULATION IN THE MAINSTREAM AND CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF FISH BIODIVERSITY.

TO REGULATE ITS IMPACT, LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL SCALES. THE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES OF WILD FAUNA AND FLORA (CITES) HAS REGULATED THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL TRADE SINCE 1975. HOWEVER, AN IMPORTANT VOLUME OF ILLEGAL TRADE—MAINLY WITHIN COUNTRIES—CONTINUES TO THREATEN SEVERAL VERTEBRATE GROUPS, WHICH COULD BE DUE TO A LACK OF SPECIFIC LEGISLATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING REGULATIONS. OUR AIM WAS TO GAIN A MORE ACCURATE PICTURE OF POACHING AND LEGAL POSSESSION OF NATIVE PARROTS AS PETS IN THE NEOTROPICS, WHERE ILLEGAL DOMESTIC TRADE IS CURRENTLY WIDESPREAD. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF THE LAWS OF EACH OF THE 50 COUNTRIES AND OVERSEAS TERRITORIES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THEIR YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION AND WHETHER THE CAPTURE, POSSESSION AND/OR SALE OF PARROTS IS PERMITTED. WE COMPARED THIS INFORMATION WITH LEGAL EXPORTS REPORTED BY CITES TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ENFORCEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS. WE FOUND THAT ONLY TWO COUNTRIES (GUYANA AND SURINAME) CURRENTLY ALLOW THE CAPTURE, TRADE AND POSSESSION OF NATIVE PARROTS, WHILE PERU ALLOWED INTERNATIONAL LEGAL TRADE UNTIL RECENTLY. THE OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE BANNED PARROT TRADE FROM YEARS TO DECADES AGO. HOWEVER, THE TIMING OF IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS VARIED GREATLY BETWEEN COUNTRIES, WITH HALF OF THEM CONTINUING TO EXPORT PARROTS LEGALLY YEARS OR DECADES AFTER BANNING DOMESTIC TRADE. THE CONFUSION CREATED BY THIS COMPLEX LEGAL SYSTEM MAY HAVE HINDERED THE ADOPTION OF CONSERVATION MEASURES, ALLOWING POACHING, KEEPING AND TRADE OF PROTECTED SPECIES WITHIN AND BETWEEN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. MOST COUNTRIES LEGALLY EXPORTED NEOTROPICAL PARROT SPECIES WHICH WERE NOT NATIVE TO THOSE COUNTRIES, INDICATING THAT TRANS-BORDER SMUGGLING OFTEN OCCURRED BETWEEN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES PRIOR TO THEIR LEGAL EXPORTATIONS, AND THAT THIS ILLICIT ACTIVITY CONTINUES FOR THE DOMESTIC TRADE.

ALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OR INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED TO MITIGATE THE BIODIVERSITY LOSS, THE EROSION OF TERRESTRIAL BIOME HABITATS IS INEVITABLE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE IDENTIFICA-TION OF POTENTIAL SUITABLE HABITATS UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN DISTURBANCE HAS BECOME AN URGENT TASK OF BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED THE MAXIMUM ENTROPY MODEL (MAXENT) TO IDENTIFY THE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE HABITATS OF ASIAN ELEPHANTS IN SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA. WE PERFORMED ANALYSES FOR FUTURE PROJECTIONS WITH 17 SCENARIOS USING THE PRESENT RESULTS AS BASELINE. TO OPTIMIZE THE MODELLING RESULTS, WE DELINEATED THE CORE HABITATS BY USING THE CORE MAPPER TOOL AND COMPARED THEM WITH EXISTING PROTECTED AREAS (PAS) THROUGH GAP ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE CURRENT TOTAL AREA OF CORE HABITATS IS 491,455 KM2 IN SIZE AND WILL BE REDUCED TO 332,544 KM2 BY 2090 UNDER SSP585 (THE SHARED SOCIOECONOMIC PATHWAY). THE PROJECTION ANALYSIS UNDER DIFFERENTIAL SCENARIOS SUGGESTED THAT MOST OF THE CORE HABITATS IN THE CURRENT PROTECTED AREAS WOULD REMAIN STABLE AND SUITABLE FOR ELEPHANTS IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THE REMAINING 75.17% OF THE CORE HABITATS LAY OUTSIDE THE CURRENT PAS, AND FINALLY WE MAPPED APPROXIMATELY 219,545 KM2 OF SUITABLE HABITATS AS PRIORITY PROTECTED AREAS IN THE FUTURE.

THUS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER ARTIFICIAL WETLANDS PLAY SIGNIFICANT ROLES AS ALTERNATIVE HABITATS FOR WETLAND BIRDS. THE DISTANCE SAMPLING POINT COUNT METHOD WAS EMPLOYED TO ASCERTAIN THE DIFFERENCE IN WATERBIRD ASSEMBLAGES INHABITING LUNGH NATURAL WETLAND AND RAJA ARTIFICIAL WETLAND IN SINDH PROVINCE, PAKISTAN FROM SEPTEMBER 2017 TO FEBRUARY 2019. NATURAL WETLANDS HARBORED 39,282 INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING 40 WATERBIRD SPECIES AND 14 FAMILIES, WHILE ARTIFICIAL WETLANDS HOSTED 23,122 INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING 39 SPECIES AND 13 FAMILIES. IN TOTAL, 37 SPECIES WERE IDENTIFIED AS LEAST CONCERN, 3 WERE NEAR THREATENED, AND ONE SPECIES WAS ENDANGERED, ONE VULNERABLE, AND ONE DATA DEFICIENT. ANAS CRECCA (4.95%) AND A.

HERE WE PRESENT THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE THREAT ASSESSMENT ACROSS THE COLORADO RIVER BASIN – ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST ENDANGERED RIVER BASINS IN NORTH AMERICA – USING A SPATIAL FRAMEWORK ACCOUNTING FOR THE WIDE RANGE OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES (LAND USES, TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE, EXPLOITATIVE ACTIVITIES, WATER WITHDRAWALS), PATHWAYS (LOCAL FOOTPRINT, OVERLAND RUNOFF, UPSTREAM CUMULATIVE EFFECTS), AND SPATIAL EXTENT OF INFLUENCE (VALLEY BOTTOM, CATCHMENT AND RIVER NETWORK) KNOWN TO AFFECT THE ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY OF RIVERINE ECOSYSTEMS. WE QUANTIFIED AND MAPPED 69 INDIVIDUAL THREAT INDICES WITH GEOSPATIAL TOOLS FOR EACH PERMANENT, EPHEMERAL, AND INTERMITTENT STREAM SEGMENT WITHIN THE BASIN, ENCOMPASSING A TOTAL OF >1,067,700 RIVER KILOMETERS. WE FURTHER AGGREGATED THESE INDICES INTO COMPONENTS OF WATER QUALITY (DIFFUSE AND POINT-SOURCE POLLUTION), HYDROLOGY (FLOW REGULATION/USES AND CLIMATE CHANGE), AND PHYSICAL SYSTEM (CONNECTIVITY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY). TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL OF OUR FRAMEWORK TO INFORM SPATIAL PLANNING DECISION PROCESSES, WE EXAMINED THE TYPICAL COMBINATIONS OF THREATS EXPERIENCED BY DIFFERENT HYDROLOGIC AREAS AND STREAM SEGMENT TYPES, IDENTIFIED CANDIDATE WATERSHEDS FOR HABITAT RESTORATION AND ENHANCEMENT WHERE HOTSPOTS OF BIODIVERSITY AND THREAT OVERLAPPED, AND ASSESSED THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THREAT INDICES AND IN SITU MEASUREMENTS OF ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY DESCRIBING A SUITE OF BIOLOGICAL (BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATE, FISH), CHEMICAL (TOTAL NITROGEN LOAD, WATER CONDUCTIVITY), HYDROLOGICAL (FLOW ALTERATION) AND PHYSICAL INDICATORS (STREAMBED STABILITY, INSTREAM HABITAT COMPLEXITY).

URBAN GREENING,1,"URBAN FORESTERS ARE ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE OF URBAN BIODIVERSITY LOSS THROUGH MANAGEMENT PLANS IN THE CONTEXT OF RAPID URBANIZATION. PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF THE URBAN ECOSYSTEM REQUIRES LONG-TERM MONITORING AND PLANNING FOR RESILIENCE AS WELL AS EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT. THE SOUNDSCAPE ASSESSMENT HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION IN THIS FIELD, BUT APPLYING THE SOUNDSCAPE ASSESSMENT IN URBAN ECOLOGICAL MONITORING REQUIRES A PROTOCOL THAT LINKS SOUNDSCAPES TO THE IMPACT OF RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ON BIODIVERSITY OVER TIME. THE EFFECTIVE PROCESSING AND VISUALIZATION OF LARGE-SCALE DATA ALSO REMAINS AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOUNDSCAPE AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS INNOVATIVE SOUNDSCAPE APPROACH IN HIGHLY URBANIZED AREAS. SOUNDSCAPE RECORDINGS WERE COLLECTED FOR 20 URBAN PARKS TWICE ON 4 CONSECUTIVE DAYS IN SPRING. A TOTAL OF 691,200 MIN OF SOUND MATERIAL WERE AUTOMATICALLY OBTAINED. IN ORDER TO TRACK THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF A SOUNDSCAPE AND DETERMINE ITS POTENTIAL SUITABILITY FOR ECOSYSTEM MONITORING, OUR STUDY CHARACTERIZED SOUNDSCAPE INFORMATION BY ADOPTING 4 WIDELY USED ACOUSTIC INDICES: ACOUSTIC DIVERSITY INDEX (ADI), BIOACOUSTIC INDEX (BIO), NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDSI), AND POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY (PSD). DAILY PATTERNS OF PSD HAVE PROVIDED A POTENTIAL CONNECTION BETWEEN SOUNDSCAPES AND BIRD SONGS, AND 1–2 KHZ PRESENTED A SIMILAR PATTERN THAT WAS LINKED TO HUMAN ACTIVITY. THROUGH FURTHER MODELING, WE TESTED THE RELATIONSHIP OF SOUNDSCAPES TO PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERISTICS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THE IMPORTANCE OF HABITAT VEGETATION STRUCTURE FOR ACOUSTIC DIVERSITY. MORE VERTICAL HETEROGENEITY, WITH AN UNEVEN CANOPY HEIGHT OR MULTILAYERED VEGETATION, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE ACOUSTIC DIVERSITY. THIS SUGGESTS THAT CLEARING GROUND COVER MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WILDLIFE. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SOUNDSCAPE APPROACHES PROVIDE A WAY TO QUICKLY SYNTHESIZE LARGE-SCALE RECORDING DATA INTO MEANINGFUL PATTERNS THAT CAN TRACK CHANGES IN BIRD SONGS AND ECOSYSTEM CONDITIONS.

CURRENT RESTORATION INITIATIVES TO RE-WET PEAT MAY BENEFIT FARMERS BY REDUCING FIRE RISK, WITHOUT AFFECTING YIELDS. WETTER FARMS HAD INCREASED UNDERSTOREY VEGETATION COMPLEXITY, BUT THIS DID NOT AFFECT BIRD DIVERSITY, SO WE FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT RE-WETTING IMPROVES ON-FARM BIODIVERSITY. HOWEVER, ON-FARM FIRE REDUCTION EFFORTS IN CULTIVATED PEATLANDS, INCLUDING RE-WETTING, WILL BE VITAL FOR REDUCING THE RISK OF FIRES ESCAPING INTO NEARBY FORESTS, WHICH CONTAIN UNIQUE AND DIVERSE BIRD SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES. PROTECTION OF REMAINING PEATLAND FORESTS FROM FIRE AND CLEARANCE IS KEY FOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, AND FOR PROVIDING A SOURCE OF SEED DISPERSERS AND GENETIC MATERIAL FOR FUTURE FOREST AND LANDSCAPE RESTORATION EFFORTS. RESTORATION OF MORE BIODIVERSITY-FRIENDLY LAND COVERS WILL IMPROVE LANDSCAPE PERMEABILITY AND HELP CONSERVE SPECIES AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY DELIVER. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

BUILDING A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PET TRADE WOULD IMPROVE PREDICTION OF CONSERVATION AND BIOSECURITY THREATS, WITH THE AIM TO PREVENT FURTHER NEGATIVE IMPACTS. WE USED SOUTH AUSTRALIA’S NATIVE WILDLIFE PERMIT REPORTING SYSTEM AS A DATA-RICH EXAMPLE OF A VERTEBRATE PET MARKET, SPANNING 590 DISTINCT TAXA ACROSS 105 FAMILIES OF TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES (MAMMALS, REPTILES, BIRDS AND AMPHIBIANS). USING A PIECEWISE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING (SEM) APPROACH, WE TESTED THE INFLUENCE OF 11 A PRIORI VARIABLES RELATING TO PETS (E.G. SPECIES TRAITS), PET OWNERS (E.G. SOCIOECONOMIC METRICS) AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS (E.G. PERMIT REQUIREMENTS) ON THE QUANTITIES OF CAPTIVE PET KEEPING, BREEDING, TRADING AND ESCAPES INTO THE WILD. BIRDS AND REPTILES WITH HIGHER ANNUAL FECUNDITY WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE KEPT IN CAPTIVITY AND BIRDS WITH LARGER ADULT MASS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE SOLD. SPECIES WITH MORE STRINGENT PERMIT REQUIREMENTS WERE POSSESSED AND ESCAPED, IN LOWER ABUNDANCES. PET KEEPING WAS WEAKLY CORRELATED WITH REGIONS OF LOWER HUMAN POPULATION DENSITIES AND HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, YET ALL SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES WERE ULTIMATELY POOR AT EXPLAINING TRADE DYNAMICS. MORE ESCAPES OCCURRED IN REGIONS THAT POSSESSED LARGER QUANTITIES OF PETS, FURTHER EMPHASISING THE ROLE OF PROPAGULE PRESSURE IN THE RISK OF PET ESCAPES. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. SPECIES TRAITS ARE A STRONG DETERMINANT OF NATIVE PET TRADE DYNAMICS, YET PERMIT SYSTEMS ALSO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DE-INCENTIVISING UNDESIRABLE TRADE PRACTICES. WHILE OUR RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTED THE POSITIVE POTENTIAL OF TRADE REGULATORY SYSTEMS, WE RECOMMEND THAT CONSISTENT PERMIT CATEGORY CRITERIA ARE ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE TRADE IN THREATENED SPECIES AS WELL AS INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES OF HIGH BIOSECURITY RISK.

YET, WE HAVE STILL A POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS THAT REGULATE SPECIES COEXISTENCE AND SHAPE THE STRUCTURE OF ASSEMBLAGES IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS CARRION PULSED RESOURCES. HERE, WE STUDY HOW LARGE VERTEBRATES COEXIST IN SCAVENGER ASSEMBLAGES BY ADAPTING THEIR DIEL ACTIVITY AT LARGE UNGULATE CARCASSES IN NW SPAIN. WE USED CAMERA TRAPS TO RECORD VERTEBRATE SCAVENGERS CONSUMING 34 CARCASSES OF LIVESTOCK AND HUNTED WILD UNGULATES, WHICH ALLOWED US TO ASSESS ALSO DIFFERENCES REGARDING CARCASS ORIGIN. TO EVALUATE TEMPORAL RESOURCE PARTITION AMONG SPECIES, WE ESTIMATED THE OVERLAP OF DIEL ACTIVITY PATTERNS AND THE MEAN TIMES OF EACH SCAVENGER AT CARCASSES. WE RECORDED 16 SPECIES OF SCAVENGERS, 7 MAMMALS AND 9 BIRDS, AND FOUND SIMILAR RICHNESS AT BOTH TYPES OF CARCASSES. BIRDS AND MAMMALS SHOWED CONTRASTING DIEL ACTIVITY PATTERNS, WITH BIRDS USING CARCASSES DURING DAYTIME (MEAN= 11:38 H) AND MAMMALS MOSTLY AT NIGHT (23:09 H). THE UNIMODAL ACTIVITY PATTERNS OF SCAVENGERS SHOWED ASYNCHRONOUS PEAKS AMONG SPECIES. SUBORDINATE SPECIES MODIFIED THEIR ACTIVITY PATTERNS AT CARCASSES USED BY APEX SPECIES TO REDUCE TEMPORAL OVERLAP. ALSO, DIEL ACTIVITY PATTERNS OF VULTURES CLOSELY FOLLOWED THOSE OF CORVIDS, SUGGESTING FACILITATION PROCESSES IN WHICH CORVIDS WOULD ENHANCE CARCASS DETECTION BY VULTURES. TWO MAMMAL SPECIES (12.5%) INCREASED NOCTURNALITY AT CARCASSES OF HUNTED UNGULATES, WHICH COULD BE A RESPONSE TO HUMAN DISTURBANCE. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT BOTH TEMPORAL SEGREGATION AND COUPLING MEDIATE THE COEXISTENCE OF LARGE VERTEBRATES AT CARCASSES. THESE MECHANISMS MIGHT LEAD TO RICHER SCAVENGER ASSEMBLAGES AND THEREBY MORE EFFICIENT ONES IN DRIVING CRITICAL ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS RELATED TO CARRION CONSUMPTION, SUCH AS ENERGY AND NUTRIENT RECYCLING AND BIODIVERSITY MAINTENANCE. © 2022 THE AUTHOR(S)",NA,NA,BAEAC,"OLEA, P.P.; TERRESTRIAL ECOLOGY GROUP (TEG), C.

BEAVER-CREATED HABITAT CHANGES AFFECT A WIDE RANGE OF AQUATIC INVERTEBRATE SPECIES. HOWEVER, DESPITE NUMEROUS INDIVIDUAL STUDIES OF HOW BEAVERS AFFECT AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES, THERE HAS BEEN NO EVALUATION OF THE CONSENSUS OF THESE EFFECTS ACROSS STUDIES. METHODOLOGY: WE COLLATED AND EXAMINED STUDIES COMPARING BEAVER-CREATED PONDS TO NEARBY LOTIC REACHES TO DETERMINE GENERAL TRENDS IN AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATE RICHNESS, DENSITY, BIOMASS, AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION BETWEEN HABITATS. FROM THIS EVIDENCE, WE HIGHIGHT KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN HOW BEAVER ACTIVITY AFFECTS AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATES. RESULTS: OVERALL, IN THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES, AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATE RICHNESS WAS HIGHER IN NEARBY LOTIC REACHES COMPARED TO BEAVER-CREATED PONDS, BUT RICHNESS AT COARSER SCALES (GAMMA DIVERSITY) INCREASED WITH THE ADDITION OF BEAVER PONDS DUE TO INCREASED HABITAT HETEROGENEITY. FUNCTIONAL FEEDING GROUP (FFG) PATTERNS WERE HIGHLY CONTEXT-DEPENDENT, THOUGH PREDATOR TAXA WERE GENERALLY MORE ABUNDANT IN BEAVER PONDS THAN ADJACENT LOTIC REACHES. SITE-SPECIFIC GEOMORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES, COUPLED WITH DAM OR RIPARIAN ZONE CHARACTERISTICS AND RESULTING DIFFERENCES IN BASAL FOOD RESOURCES LIKELY SHAPE OTHER FFG RESPONSES.

SCALING UP OF NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS (NBS) TO EFFECTIVELY PROTECT, SUSTAINABLY MANAGE, AND RESTORE COASTAL SEASCAPES IS URGENTLY REQUIRED FOR MITIGATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS. EVIDENCE-BASED SITE SELECTION IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES AND AVOID NEGATIVE IMPACTS WHEN PRIORITIZING NBS INVESTMENTS AT NATIONAL LEVEL. WE DEVELOPED A SPATIALLY EXPLICIT, INTEGRATIVE AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT ECOSYSTEM-BASED SITE SELECTION PROCESS TO IDENTIFY A PORTFOLIO OF SEASCAPES FOR NBS CONSIDERATION IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (UAE). THE PRIMARY GOAL WAS TO RANK PLANNING UNITS BASED ON POTENTIAL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ACTION, POSITIVE IMPACT TO BIODIVERSITY AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO PEOPLE. THE MULTI-CRITERIA SITE-SELECTION FRAMEWORK PROVIDED A RAPID, TRANSPARENT, REPEATABLE AND SCALABLE TOOL. THE HIGHEST WEIGHTINGS WERE ASSIGNED TO BLUE CARBON STORAGE VALUE, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION FEATURES, AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDER PREFERRED AREAS. SPATIAL PROXIES FOR BENEFITS TO PEOPLE WERE REPRESENTED BY POPULATION DENSITY AND ACCESSIBILITY TO COASTAL SEASCAPES, RELATIVE TOURISM AND RECREATION POTENTIAL, AND IMPORTANCE OF FISH HABITAT AND FISHING GROUNDS FOR FOOD SECURITY. PARTICIPATORY MAPPING OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND REVIEW OF EXISTING DATA ENSURED THAT BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA WERE RELIABLE, UP-TO-DATE AND LOCALLY RELEVANT. TWO DISTINCT CLUSTERS OF HIGH SUITABILITY PLANNING UNITS WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE ABU DHABI REGION AND FOUR ALONG THE NORTH-WESTERN COAST OF THE UAE. MOST HIGH SUITABILITY SITES WERE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF EXISTING MARINE PROTECTED AREAS. ALTERNATIVE SPATIAL SCENARIOS WITHOUT STAKEHOLDER BIAS UNDERSCORED THE SUITABILITY OF SITES IDENTIFIED THROUGH PARTICIPATORY MAPPING AND HIGHLIGHTED ADDITIONAL PRIORITY SITES FOR FUTURE SCALING-UP OF NBS.

ENVIRON. SCI.,1,"FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY HAS UNDERGONE DRASTIC DECLINES DUE TO AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION DURING THE LAST DECADES. TO PREVENT FURTHER BIODIVERSITY LOSS, THE MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION OF NON-PRODUCTIVE HABITATS IS ESSENTIAL. WOODLOTS, SMALL PATCHES OF WOODY VEGETATION IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, ARE ONE SUCH HABITAT THAT ARE CURRENTLY SUBSIDIZED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION’S COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY (EU’S CAP). FOR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION, HOWEVER, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSESS WHAT HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS ARE THE MOST BENEFICIAL FOR BIODIVERSITY. OUR STUDY PERFORMS SUCH AN ASSESSMENT USING BIRDS AS MODEL ORGANISMS. SPECIFICALLY, WE RELATED CHARACTERISTICS OF VARIOUS WOODLOTS TO (I) THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF ALL BIRDS, AND (II) THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF BOTH FOREST AND FARMLAND BIRDS–GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE COUNTED BIRDS (27 FARMLAND AND 26 FOREST SPECIES) AND MEASURED HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS (DESCRIBING VEGETATION STRUCTURE, DIVERSITY AND NATIVENESS) AND SPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS (AREA, SHAPE AND ISOLATION) IN 82 MID-FIELD WOODLOTS (0.76–1.25 HA, AVERAGE 0.46 HA) IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC (CENTRAL EUROPE). AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF SPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS, OVERALL BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS INCREASED WITH VEGETATION HEIGHT AND WOODY PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS. IN ADDITION, RICHNESS SHOWED A NON-LINEAR DECREASE WITH THE COVER OF AN INVASIVE TREE, THE BLACK LOCUST ROBINIA PSEUDOACCACIA. INTERESTINGLY, FOREST BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS WAS RELATED TO THE SAME HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS AS THE OVERALL BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS. BY CONTRAST, FARMLAND BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE DIVERSITY OF WOODLOT MICROHABITATS, WHICH REFLECTS MAINLY ENRICHMENT BY NON-FOREST SITES SUCH AS GRASSLAND OR SPARSE SHRUBS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE ECOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE OF HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS (AND NOT ONLY THE WOODLOT AREA) IS IMPORTANT FOR THE RESTORATION OF BIRD DIVERSITY IN WOODLOTS, AND AS SUCH SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY THE EU’S CAP SUBSIDY SYSTEM. MOREOVER, IF WOODLOT MANAGEMENT AIMS TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL BIRD DIVERSITY—A COMMON PRACTICE IN BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION—OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT CURRENT PRACTICES MAY FAVOR WIDESPREAD FOREST BIRD SPECIES, BUT NOT THE FARMLAND BIRDS THAT ARE MORE THREATENED IN EUROPE. TO MANAGE THE WOODLOT HABITAT FOR FARMLAND BIRDS, WE SUGGEST THAT MICROHABITAT HETEROGENEITY SHOULD BE MAXIMIZED.

ECOACOUSTIC MONITORING CAN BE APPLIED ACROSS LARGE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES, OFFERING THE POTENTIAL FOR LESS RESOURCE-INTENSIVE ECOSYSTEM MONITORING. INDICES OF ACOUSTIC DIVERSITY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CORRELATE WITH SPECIES RICHNESS OF VARIOUS TAXA, AS WELL AS VEGETATION AND LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE. IN ORDER TO APPLY ECOACOUSTIC MONITORING AT LARGE SCALES WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF LOCAL AND REGIONAL LAND-USE ON ACOUSTIC PATTERNS, AND ASSESS HOW TEMPORAL ASPECTS OF ACOUSTIC PATTERNS CAN BE INTEGRATED IN THESE ANALYSES. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT LAND-USE INTENSITY AND LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AFFECT SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION OF BIRDS AND ORTHOPTERAN, AND THEREFORE INDIRECTLY AFFECT ACOUSTIC DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION. TO TEST THIS, WE SET UP AUTONOMOUS RECORDING SYSTEMS IN GRASSLAND PLOTS ALONG LAND-USE INTENSITY GRADIENTS IN THREE REGIONS IN GERMANY. WE APPLIED STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING TO ANALYZE THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT DRIVERS OF ACOUSTIC DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION, INCLUDING MOWING AND GRAZING INTENSITIES, LANDSCAPE DIVERSITY, DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST ROAD, VASCULAR PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS AS WELL AS BIRD AND ORTHOPTERAN SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION. SINGLE INDICES OF ACOUSTIC DIVERSITY DID NOT REFLECT CHANGES IN BIRD OR ORTHOPTERAN SPECIES RICHNESS, MAKING THEM POOR PREDICTORS FOR LOCAL LAND-USE RELATED CHANGES IN SPECIES RICHNESS IN GRASSLAND PLOTS. ACOUSTIC COMPOSITION (NON-METRIC MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING COMBINATION OF MEAN MONTHLY ACOUSTIC INDICES AT DIFFERENT DAY PHASES), HOWEVER, DID RELATE TO DIFFERENCES IN LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE, LAND-USE INTENSITY, VOCALIZING SPECIES COMPOSITION AND ORTHOPTERAN SPECIES RICHNESS.

HERE WE STUDY GENETIC POPULATION STRUCTURE IN THE ENDANGERED ASHY RED COLOBUS (PILIOCOLOBUS TEPHROSCELES) POPULATION IN THE FOREST FRAGMENTS SURROUNDING KIBALE NATIONAL PARK, UGANDA. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE USE LANDSCAPE FEATURES (ELEVATION, ROAD DATA AND DISTANCE TO THE PARK) TO DESIGN A FEASIBLE STRATEGY TO RESTORE FOREST IN A FASHION SUITABLE FOR BOTH THE DISPERSAL PATTERNS OF THE SPECIES AND LAND USE PRACTICES OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE. A LACK OF ASSOCIATION BETWEEN GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE AND PAIRWISE GENETIC RELATEDNESS AMONG LOCALITIES, THE PRESENCE OF FIRST DEGREE RELATIVES ACROSS LOCALITIES, AND A LOW GLOBAL FST VALUE SUGGEST THAT RED COLOBUS INDIVIDUALS HAVE MIGRATED ACROSS THIS LANDSCAPE IN THE RECENT PAST. THUS, A SERIES OF “STEPPING STONE” FORESTS FROM THE FRAGMENTS TO THE PARK WILL LIKELY MAINTAIN VIABILITY OF RED COLOBUS FRAGMENT POPULATIONS.

THE COMMON CARP HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN EVERY FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEM OF PAKISTAN AND IS A LEADING THREAT TO THE NATIVE ICHTHYOFAUNA. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, STABLE ISOTOPES OF NITROGEN AND CARBON (Δ15N AND Δ13C) ARE USED TO EXPLORE THE FEEDING NICHE OVERLAP AMONG ALIEN CYPRINUS CARPIO (COMMON CARP) AND NATIVE OMNIVOROUS FISHES INCLUDING TOR PUTITORA (MAHSEER) AND BARILIUS PAKISTANICUS (PAKISTANI CHALWA) FROM SWAT RIVER, KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA (KP), PAKISTAN. DIFFERENCES IN MEAN VALUES OF Δ15N AND Δ13C AMONG THE SPECIES WERE FOUND NON-SIGNIFICANT. COMMUNITY-WIDE METRICS WITHIN Δ13C-Δ15N BI-PLOT SPACE REFLECTING VITAL ASPECTS OF THE TROPHIC STRUCTURE WERE ALSO CALCULATED. IT WAS FOUND THAT ALL THE SELECTED SPECIES WERE FEEDING AT THE SAME TROPHIC LEVEL, WHEREAS NICHE SIZE AND TROPHIC DIVERSITY OF COMMON CARP WAS GREATER COMPARED TO BOTH OF THE NATIVE SPECIES WHICH INDICATED THAT THIS ALIEN FISH IS A HIGHLY OPPORTUNISTIC FEEDER ON DIFFERENT FOOD ITEMS WITH MULTIPLE BASAL RESOURCES HAVING A WIDE RANGE OF Δ13C VALUES. MAHSEER OCCUPIED A VERY SMALL TROPHIC NICHE WITHIN THE NICHE SPACE OF COMMON CARP.

IN NORTH AMERICA, LONG-TERM POPULATION DECLINES HAVE ELEVATED THE RECOVERY OF THE GRASSLAND AVIFAUNA TO AMONG THE HIGHEST CONSERVATIONPRIORITIES. BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF GRASSLANDS OF THE GREAT PLAINS ARE PRIVATELY OWNED, THE RECOVERY OF THESE ECOSYSTEMS AND BIRD POPULATIONS WITHIN THEM DEPEND ON LANDSCAPE-SCALE CONSERVATION STRATEGIES THAT INTEGRATE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND BIODIVERSITY OBJECTIVES. THE CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM (CRP) IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM FOR PRIVATE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS ADMINISTERED BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE THAT PROVIDES FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO TAKE CROPLAND OUT OF PRODUCTION AND RESTORE PERENNIAL GRASSLAND. WE INVESTIGATED SPATIAL PATTERNS OF GRASSLAND AVAILABILITY AND RESTORATION TO INFORM LANDSCAPE-SCALE CONSERVATION FOR A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY OF GRASSLAND BIRDS IN THE GREAT PLAINS. THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES WERE TO (1) DETERMINE HOW APPARENT HABITAT LOSS HAS AFFECTED SPATIAL PATTERNS OF GRASSLAND BIRD BIODIVERSITY, (2) EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CRP FOR OFFSETTING THE BIODIVERSITY DECLINES OF GRASSLAND BIRDS, AND (3) DEVELOP SPATIALLY EXPLICIT PREDICTIONS TO ESTIMATE THE BIODIVERSITY BENEFIT OF ADDING CRP TO LANDSCAPES IMPACTED BY HABITAT LOSS. WE USED THE INTEGRATED MONITORING IN BIRD CONSERVATION REGIONS PROGRAM TO EVALUATE HYPOTHESES FOR THE EFFECTS OF HABITAT LOSS AND RESTORATION ON BOTH THE OCCUPANCY AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF GRASSLAND SPECIALISTS WITHIN A CONTINUUM-MODELING FRAMEWORK. WE FOUND THE ODDS OF COMMUNITY OCCUPANCY DECLINED BY 37% FOR EVERY 1 SD DECREASE IN GRASSLAND AVAILABILITY [LOGE(KM2)] AND INCREASED BY 20% FOR EVERY 1 SD INCREASE IN CRP LAND COVER [LOGE(KM2)]. THERE WAS 17% TURNOVER IN SPECIES COMPOSITION BETWEEN INTACT GRASSLANDS AND CRP LANDSCAPES, SUGGESTING THAT GRASSLANDS RESTORED BY CRP RETAINED CONSIDERABLE, BUT INCOMPLETE, REPRESENTATION OF BIODIVERSITY IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. SPATIALLY EXPLICIT PREDICTIONS INDICATED THAT ABSOLUTE CONSERVATION OUTCOMES WERE GREATEST AT HIGH LATITUDES IN REGIONS WITH HIGH BIODIVERSITY, WHEREAS THE RELATIVE OUTCOMES WERE GREATER AT LOW LATITUDES IN HIGHLY MODIFIED LANDSCAPES.

STUDIES REGARDING DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEMS HAVE BECOME EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING COMMUNITIES AND PROMOTING STRATEGIES FOR CONSERVATION, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVING FOREST RESTORATION AS STRATEGY TO REVERSE BIODIVERSITY LOSS. WE COMPARED BEE DIVERSITY INDICES BETWEEN THREE REMNANTS OF ATLANTIC RAINFOREST IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL AND FOUR ADJACENT AREAS THAT WERE REFORESTED AFTER SHALE MINING, AND WHICH ARE NOW UNDER DIFFERENT RESTORATION LEVELS. SEVEN SITES WERE MONITORED FOR OVER 5 YEARS (2011–2016), BY SAMPLING BEES DIRECTLY ON FLOWERS OR IN FLIGHT USING AN ENTOMOLOGICAL NET, WITH 400 COLLECTED INDIVIDUALS/SITE/YEAR. BEE SPECIES COMPOSITION DIFFERED BETWEEN POST-MINING AGES AND BETWEEN SITES. IN ALL, WE SAMPLED 14.185 SPECIMENS AND 236 BEE SPECIES. THE INTRODUCED AFRICANIZED APIS MELLIFERA LINNAEUS WAS THE MOST FREQUENT AND ABUNDANT SPECIES, FOLLOWED BY TRIGONA SPINIPES AND PSAENYTHIA BERGII HOLMBERG. AMONG HABITATS, THE REFORESTED AREA IN INITIAL PHASE SHOWED LOWER RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY IN RELATION ALL OTHERS SAMPLE SITES. CONVERSELY, ALL INDICES WERE HIGHER IN FOREST REMNANTS, MIDDLE PHASE II, AND ADVANCED PHASE REFORESTED AREAS, REINFORCING THE IMPORTANCE OF REFORESTATION FOR CONSERVATION, NOTABLY ENDANGERED SPECIES, SUCH AS OXYTRIGONA SP., SCHWARZIANA QUADRIPUNCTATA (LEPELETIER), AND THE SOLITARY SPECIES OF THE GENUS HYLAEUS, ALL FOUND IN THE RESTORED AREAS. THESE RESULTS REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION FOR UNDERSTANDING THE RECOVERY OF THE BEE FAUNA IN RESTORED MINING HABITATS. THE DATASET REVEALS AN INTERESTING RESPONSE IN AREAS THAT WERE MINED FOR SHALE EXTRACTION AND ARE NOW UNDERGOING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RESTORATION, SUGGESTING THAT OLDER REFORESTED HABITATS HAVE A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF HAVING A FULLY RECOVERED BEE COMMUNITY. © 2022, SOCIEDADE ENTOMOLÓGICA DO BRASIL.",NA,NA,NA,"GRUCHOWSKI-WOITOWICZ, F.C.; LABORATÓRIO DE BIONOMIA, BA, BRAZIL; EMAIL: FRANCIELLICGW@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1007/s13744-022-00949-8,NA,1519566X,NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,2,230-242,SPRINGER,35165852,SCOPUS,"WHAT CAN RESTORATION DO FOR BEE COMMUNITIES?

AS AN EXAMPLE, WE FOCUS ON MOLLUSCS, THE SECOND LARGEST PHYLUM IN NUMBERS OF KNOWN SPECIES, AND, EXTRAPOLATING BOLDLY, ESTIMATE THAT, SINCE AROUND AD 1500, POSSIBLY AS MANY AS 7.5–13% (150,000–260,000) OF ALL ~2 MILLION KNOWN SPECIES HAVE ALREADY GONE EXTINCT, ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE GREATER THAN THE 882 (0.04%) ON THE RED LIST. WE REVIEW DIFFERENCES IN EXTINCTION RATES ACCORDING TO REALMS: MARINE SPECIES FACE SIGNIFICANT THREATS BUT, ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS MASS EXTINCTIONS WERE LARGELY DEFINED BY MARINE INVERTEBRATES, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE MARINE BIOTA HAS REACHED THE SAME CRISIS AS THE NON-MARINE BIOTA. ISLAND SPECIES HAVE SUFFERED FAR GREATER RATES THAN CONTINENTAL ONES. PLANTS FACE SIMILAR CONSERVATION BIASES AS DO INVERTEBRATES, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE HINTS THEY MAY HAVE SUFFERED LOWER EXTINCTION RATES. THERE ARE ALSO THOSE WHO DO NOT DENY AN EXTINCTION CRISIS BUT ACCEPT IT AS A NEW TRAJECTORY OF EVOLUTION, BECAUSE HUMANS ARE PART OF THE NATURAL WORLD; SOME EVEN EMBRACE IT, WITH A DESIRE TO MANIPULATE IT FOR HUMAN BENEFIT. WE TAKE ISSUE WITH THESE STANCES. HUMANS ARE THE ONLY SPECIES ABLE TO MANIPULATE THE EARTH ON A GRAND SCALE, AND THEY HAVE ALLOWED THE CURRENT CRISIS TO HAPPEN. DESPITE MULTIPLE CONSERVATION INITIATIVES AT VARIOUS LEVELS, MOST ARE NOT SPECIES ORIENTED (CERTAIN CHARISMATIC VERTEBRATES EXCEPTED) AND SPECIFIC ACTIONS TO PROTECT EVERY LIVING SPECIES INDIVIDUALLY ARE SIMPLY UNFEASIBLE BECAUSE OF THE TYRANNY OF NUMBERS. AS SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGISTS, WE ENCOURAGE THE NURTURING OF THE INNATE HUMAN APPRECIATION OF BIODIVERSITY, BUT WE REAFFIRM THE MESSAGE THAT THE BIODIVERSITY THAT MAKES OUR WORLD SO FASCINATING, BEAUTIFUL AND FUNCTIONAL IS VANISHING UNNOTICED AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE. IN THE FACE OF A MOUNTING CRISIS, SCIENTISTS MUST ADOPT THE PRACTICES OF PREVENTIVE ARCHAEOLOGY, AND COLLECT AND DOCUMENT AS MANY SPECIES AS POSSIBLE BEFORE THEY DISAPPEAR. ALL THIS DEPENDS ON REVIVING THE VENERABLE STUDY OF NATURAL HISTORY AND TAXONOMY. DENYING THE CRISIS, SIMPLY ACCEPTING IT AND DOING NOTHING, OR EVEN EMBRACING IT FOR THE OSTENSIBLE BENEFIT OF HUMANITY, ARE NOT APPROPRIATE OPTIONS AND PAVE THE WAY FOR THE EARTH TO CONTINUE ON ITS SAD TRAJECTORY TOWARDS A SIXTH MASS EXTINCTION. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

HOWEVER, DESPITE THE CURRENT ALARMING LOSS OF PLANT DIVERSITY, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW PLANT DIVERSITY AFFECTS SOIL FAUNA COMMUNITIES. BY SYNTHESIZING 623 PAIRED OBSERVATIONS OF PLANT MIXTURES AND CORRESPONDING MONOCULTURES FROM 40 STUDIES, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF PLANT MIXTURES ON SOIL FAUNA ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY. FURTHER, WE INVESTIGATED THE DEPENDENCE OF MIXTURE EFFECTS ON SPECIES RICHNESS, STAND AGE, CLIMATE CONDITIONS, AND ECOSYSTEM TYPES. WE FOUND THAT, ON AVERAGE, THE DIVERSITY OF SOIL FAUNA WAS 10% HIGHER IN PLANT MIXTURES THAN THE AVERAGE OF CORRESPONDING MONOCULTURES, WHILE THE ABUNDANCE OF FAUNA DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE MIXTURES AND THE AVERAGE OF MONOCULTURES. THE MIXTURE EFFECTS ON BOTH SOIL FAUNA ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY INCREASED WITH PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS IN MIXTURES, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF SOIL FAUNA IN SPECIES-RICH PLANT MIXTURES THAN THE AVERAGES OF THEIR CORRESPONDING MONOCULTURES.

VARIOUS CONSERVATION MEASURES, INCLUDING EU AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEMES (AES), HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO PREVENT FURTHER BIODIVERSITY LOSS. DESPITE THE AES WERE CRITICIZED FOR LIMITED BENEFITS FOR BIODIVERSITY, THE EXISTING CONSERVATION EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATED SOME AES, SUCH AS SEED-RICH STRIPS (SRS), CAN HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON OVERALL BIODIVERSITY. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SRS DURING WINTER IS LARGELY MISSING IN EASTERN EUROPE OR IT IS BASED ON SINGLE-SPECIES EVALUATIONS. IN OUR STUDY, WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF SRS ON SEVERAL TAXA TYPICAL OF THE FARMLAND (I.E., FARMLAND BIRDS, EUROPEAN HARE, ROE DEER AND SMALL MAMMALS) DURING WINTER, WHEN THESE SPECIES MAY SUFFER FROM A LACK OF FOOD SOURCES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF SPATIAL LOCATION (HEDGES, FORESTS, AND OPEN FIELDS), TIME IN THE SEASON (EARLY AND LATE WINTER), AND AREA (SINGLE LARGE OR SEVERAL SMALL ANALYSIS, I.E., “SLOSS ANALYSIS”) OF SRS ON SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF BIRDS AND MAMMALS. SRS SHOWED HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE THAN CONTROL TRANSECTS, EXCEPT FOR ROE DEER. THE LARGEST DIFFERENCES IN ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF FARMLAND BIRDS BETWEEN THE SRS AND THE CONTROLS WERE FOUND IN THE FIELDS. THE HIGHEST ABUNDANCE OF EUROPEAN HARE AND SMALL MAMMALS WERE FOUND IN SRS LOCATED IN THE FIELDS. ORDINATION ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT SEVERAL BIRD SPECIES PREFERRED SRS. MOREOVER, DIFFERENT BIRDS OCCURRED IN STRIPS ADJACENT TO OPEN FIELDS, HEDGES, AND FOREST, INDICATING THAT THE LANDSCAPE CONTEXT OF SRS CAN AFFECT ITS USE BY DIFFERENT BIRD SPECIES. WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE ABUNDANCE OF FARMLAND BIRDS AND DECLINING FARMLAND SPECIES DURING LATE WINTER IN THE SRS, BUT NOT IN THE CONTROLS, SUGGESTING THE SRS MAY BE DEPLETED OF SEEDS TOWARDS THE END OF WINTER. FINALLY, THE SLOSS ANALYSIS INDICATED THERE WAS NO CLEAR DIFFERENCE IN SPECIES RICHNESS BETWEEN SMALL-TO-LARGE AND LARGE-TO-SMALL STRIPS ACCUMULATION, BUT THE POOLED ABUNDANCE OF ALL BIRDS AND MAMMALS WAS GENERALLY HIGHER AT A FEW LARGE RATHER THAN MANY SMALL PATCHES OF THE SAME CUMULATIVE SIZE. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT SRS ARE A SIMPLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE MEASURE FOR FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. EVEN RELATIVELY SMALL SRS ARE USED BY MANY SPECIES AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE PROMOTED.

IN COLOMBIA, THE MAGDALENA RIVER BASIN IS HOME TO A MEGADIVERSE WILDLIFE COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY EXPOSED TO PERVASIVE HABITAT LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION. WITHIN A LONG-TERM PROJECT ON THE CONSERVATION OF CRITICALLY ENDANGERED BROWN SPIDER MONKEYS (ATELES HYBRIDUS), WE SIGNED CONSERVATION AGREEMENTS WITH LOCAL LANDOWNERS TO PROTECT THE REMAINING FORESTS AND RECONNECT THEM THROUGH RESTORATION CORRIDORS. WE ESTABLISHED 10 CORRIDORS WITHIN A MATRIX OF PASTURES USED FOR CATTLE-RANCHING WHICH RECONNECT APPROXIMATELY 1,000 HA OF FORESTS. WE PLANTED TREES IN 2016/2017 AND 2020, ESTABLISHED 24 VEGETATION PLOTS (10 × 10 M) TO MEASURE THEIR STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION, AND COMPARED THEM WITH SIX VEGETATION PLOTS (50 × 2 M) IN FOREST FRAGMENTS. WE INSTALLED CAMERA TRAPS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CORRIDORS AS POTENTIAL PATHWAYS FOR TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES IN A FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPE. OVERALL, FOREST STRUCTURE DIFFERED BETWEEN YOUNG CORRIDORS (1 YEAR) AND BOTH OLDER CORRIDORS (5 YEARS) AND FORESTS; OLDER CORRIDORS HAD NO STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES WITH FOREST FRAGMENTS.

WE PERFORMED POINT-COUNT BIRD SURVEYS WITHIN A REGION OF TROPICAL DECIDUOUS AND SEASONAL OAK FORESTS CONSIDERING THREE DEGREES OF ANTHROPIZATION: PRIMARY FOREST, SECONDARY GROWTH, AND HUMAN SETTLEMENTS.

HERE, WE ASSESS HOW INSECTIVOROUS BATS RESPOND TO FOREST FRAGMENTATION IN THOUSAND ISLAND LAKE, A MEGA-HYDROELECTRIC DAM IN EAST CHINA. BAT ASSEMBLAGES WERE SURVEYED ACROSS 36 LAND-BRIDGE ISLANDS OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND DEGREES OF ISOLATION, USING AUDIOMOTH RECORDERS. ECHOLOCATION CALLS WERE CLASSIFIED INTO SONOTYPES, EACH CORRESPONDING TO EITHER SINGLE OR MULTIPLE SPECIES, WHICH WERE FURTHER CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR HABITAT AFFINITIES INTO FOREST OR OPEN-SPACE FORAGERS. BASED ON 22 875 FIVE-MIN RECORDINGS FROM 108 DETECTOR-NIGHTS, WE RECORDED 15 BAT SONOTYPES, EIGHT OF WHICH WE CLASSIFIED AS FOREST SONOTYPES (2329 BAT PASSES) AND SEVEN AS OPEN-SPACE SONOTYPES (52 277 BAT PASSES). OVERALL, SONOTYPE RICHNESS INCREASED WITH ISLAND AREA, BUT ONLY ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD (34 HA). HABITAT AFFINITY PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENSEMBLE-LEVEL RESPONSES TO FRAGMENTATION; FOREST SONOTYPE RICHNESS INCREASED WITH ISLAND AREA, WHEREAS OPEN-SPACE SONOTYPE ACTIVITY WAS HIGHER IN MORE ISOLATED ISLANDS. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE RELEVANCE OF PARTICULARLY LARGE FRAGMENTS (>1000 HA) TO MAINTAIN AREA-SENSITIVE FOREST BAT SPECIES.

BIOL.,1,"THE TRADE IN WILD MEAT IS AN IMPORTANT ECONOMIC COMPONENT OF RURAL PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS, BUT IT HAS BEEN PERCEIVED TO BE AMONG THE MAIN CAUSES OF THE DECLINE OF WILDLIFE SPECIES. RECENTLY, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN OF WILDLIFE MARKETS AS A MAJOR HUMAN-HEALTH CHALLENGE. WE ANALYZED DATA FROM THE LARGEST LONGITUDINAL MONITORING (1973–2018) OF THE MOST IMPORTANT URBAN WILD-MEAT MARKETS IN IQUITOS, PERU, TO EXAMINE THE TRENDS IN AND IMPACTS OF THESE MARKETS ON PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS. OVER THE LAST 45 YEARS, WILD MEAT SALES INCREASED AT A RATE OF 6.4 T/YEAR (SD 2.17), PARALLELING URBAN POPULATION GROWTH. WILD MEAT SALES WERE HIGHEST IN 2018 (442 T), CONTRIBUTING US$2.6 MILLION (0.76%) TO THE REGIONAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. FIVE SPECIES OF UNGULATES AND RODENTS ACCOUNTED FOR 88.5% OF THE AMOUNT OF BIOMASS TRADED. VULNERABLE AND ENDANGERED SPECIES REPRESENTED 7.0% AND 0.4% OF INDIVIDUALS SOLD, RESPECTIVELY. DESPITE GROWTH IN SALES, THE CONTRIBUTION OF WILD MEAT TO OVERALL URBAN DIET WAS CONSTANT: 1–2%/YEAR OF TOTAL MEAT CONSUMED. THIS RESULT WAS DUE TO GREATER AVAILABILITY AND HIGHER CONSUMPTION OF CHEAPER MEATS (E.G., IN 2018, POULTRY WAS 45.8% CHEAPER AND WAS THE MOST CONSUMED MEAT) COUPLED WITH THE LACK OF ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO HARVEST WILD MEAT SPECIES IN RURAL AREAS. MOST WILD MEAT WAS SOLD SALTED OR SMOKED, REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FOODBORNE DISEASES. COMMUNITY-BASED WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT PLANS AND THE CONTINUED TRADE BANS ON PRIMATES AND THREATENED TAXA MAY AVOID BIODIVERSITY LOSS. CONSIDERING THE RECENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC, FUTURE MANAGEMENT PLANS SHOULD INCLUDE POTENTIAL VIRAL HOSTS AND REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF HYGIENE PRACTICES IN WILD-MEAT MARKETS. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

HOWEVER, STUDIES FOCUSED ON DETERMINING THE RESPONSE OF LOCAL BIODIVERSITY TO URBANIZATION ARE STILL SCARCE, ESPECIALLY IN TROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS. URBAN ECOSYSTEMS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY LOW BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY WHICH IN TURN LEADS TO A REDUCTION IN BIODIVERSITY. HOWEVER, THE RESPONSES TO URBANIZATION SHOULD BE SPECIES DEPENDENT. FOR INSTANCE, CHANGES IN THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES CAN FAVOR CERTAIN SPECIES WITH SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS. WE ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF THE URBANIZATION PROCESS ON A BIRD COMMUNITY IN A CITY LOCATED IN THE TROPICAL ANDES OF SOUTHERN ECUADOR, A REGION WIDELY RECOGNIZED FOR ITS DIVERSITY AND ENDEMISM OF BIRDS. WE SELECTED THREE INDEPENDENT LOCALITIES IN EACH OF THE FOUR LEVELS OF THE URBANIZATION GRADIENT IN THE STUDY AREA (FOREST, FOREST-PASTURE, PASTURE, AND URBAN). IN EACH LOCALITY, WE SAMPLED THE BIRD COMMUNITY BY VISUAL AND AUDITORY SURVEYS ALONG 1 KM TRANSECTS BETWEEN 2016 AND 2017. WE RECORDED A TOTAL OF 1,257 INDIVIDUALS BELONGING TO 74 BIRD SPECIES. WE EVALUATED IF THE RESPONSES OF RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF BIRDS ARE DEPENDENT ON TROPHIC GUILD AND FORAGING STRATA. WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE FROM FOREST TO URBAN SITES. HOWEVER, THE RESPONSE OF BIRDS WAS DEPENDENT ON THE TROPHIC GUILD AND FORAGING STRATA. GRANIVOROUS BIRDS SHOWED A POSITIVE RESPONSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE URBANIZATION GRADIENT WHILE INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS SHOWED A NEGATIVE RESPONSE. INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS WERE MORE ABUNDANT IN FOREST SITES AND DECREASED IN ABUNDANCE ACROSS THE URBANIZATION GRADIENT. WE FOUND THAT THE PROPORTION OF BIRDS USING DIFFERENT FORAGING STRATA DRASTICALLY CHANGED ALONG URBAN GRADIENT. FOREST SITES EXHIBITED A BIRD COMMUNITY USING A VARIETY OF HABITATS, BUT THE BIRD COMMUNITY BECAME SIMPLER TOWARD THE MOST URBANIZED SITES. OUR FINDINGS SHOWED DIFFERENT EFFECTS OF URBANIZATION ON BIRD COMMUNITIES. THE UGLY: URBANIZATION LEADS TO A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN THE DIVERSITY OF BIRDS, WHICH IS CONSISTENT IN CITIES WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS AND ECOLOGICAL CONTEXTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE RESPONSES OF BIRD GUILDS TO URBANIZATION ARE SPECIES DEPENDENT. SOME GUILDS ARE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY URBANIZATION AND SHOW INCREASES IN SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WHILE OTHER GUILDS ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

DAM CONSTRUCTION FOR ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION REPRESENTS A SEVERE HUMAN ALTERATION OF ECOSYSTEMS WITH CONSEQUENCES FOR PRIMATE CONSERVATION. TO EVALUATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY IN A. CARAYA, WE ANALYSED AND COMPARED THE GENETIC STRUCTURE OF THE SPECIES ACROSS 22 STUDY SITES IN ARGENTINA (14), PARAGUAY (1), AND BRAZIL (7). FOUR OF THESE STUDY SITES (REFERRED TO AS FLOODED) WERE SAMPLED BEFORE DAM-LINKED FLOODING WHICH MOST LIKELY CAUSED A DRASTIC DECLINE OR FUNCTIONAL EXTINCTION OF THESE POPULATIONS. THE GENETIC VARIABILITY OF 256 INDIVIDUALS WAS EVALUATED USING 10 AUTOSOMAL MICROSATELLITES (STRS) AND 112 INDIVIDUALS BY SEQUENCING A FRAGMENT OF 507 BP OF MTDNA. DNA WAS EXTRACTED FROM TISSUE, BLOOD, AND FAECAL SAMPLES. SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER VALUES OF GENETIC VARIABILITY WERE OBSERVED FOR THE FLOODED POPULATIONS BOTH IN MTDNA AND STRS. POPULATION GENETIC STRUCTURE SHOWED A K = 1, 2, OR 5 DEPENDING ON THE METHOD, SEPARATING ARGENTINIAN AND PARAGUAYAN SITES FROM BRAZILIAN SITES AND, IN THE CASE OF K = 5, TWO CLUSTERS WERE MOSTLY REPRESENTED BY FLOODED POPULATIONS. ISOLATION-BY-DISTANCE ANALYSES SHOWED THAT GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES INFLUENCE GENE FLOW. ANALYTICAL METHODS, SUCH AS PAIRWISE FST’S AND NEI’S AND REGRESSION MODEL OF HARPENDING AND WARD, WERE CONCORDANT IN DETECTING SIGNIFICANT GENETIC STRUCTURING BETWEEN FLOODED AND REMAINING SITES EXAMINED. ALTHOUGH SOME SITES HAVE VERY LOW SAMPLE SIZES, THESE SAMPLES ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE SINCE THESE SAMPLING SITES ARE CURRENTLY FLOODED. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE STUDY SITES WHERE DAMS WERE BUILT HAD THE GREATEST GENETIC DIVERSITY. AS A. CARAYA IS CURRENTLY SEVERELY THREATENED BY YELLOW FEVER OUTBREAKS, THE REMAINING POPULATIONS MAY BE MORE VULNERABLE TO DISEASE OUTBREAKS DUE TO IMPOVERISHED GENETIC VARIABILITY. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO IMPLEMENT MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TO CONSERVE THE REMAINING POPULATIONS. OUR RESULTS UNDERLINE THE IMPORTANCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS (EIA) TO INCLUDE DATA ON THE GENETIC STRUCTURE OF SPECIES IN THE AFFECTED SITES PRIOR TO THEIR ALTERATION OR DESTRUCTION. THESE GENETIC DATA ARE ALSO REMARKABLY IMPORTANT FOR DETERMINING WHERE TO RELOCATE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS TO HELP AVOID BIODIVERSITY LOSS.

RIVER FISH, AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS, ARE UNDER THREAT OF POPULATION DEGRADATION AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION OF RIVER WATER ENERGY RESOURCES. THE ECOLOGICAL OPERATION OF THE RESERVOIR IS ECO-ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO ALLEVIATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS, WHICH ARTIFICIALLY CREATES HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDRODYNAMIC CONDITIONS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT OF FISH DURING KEY LIFE PERIODS. HOWEVER, BASED ON ECOLOGICAL OPERATION PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE, THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE DOWNSTREAM FLOW CONDITIONS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE FISH REQUIREMENT IN LOCAL PERIODS AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT OPERATION CONDITIONS OF RESERVOIRS. THAT MEANS THE ECOLOGICAL OPERATION STILL NEEDS IMPROVEMENT. THIS PAPER TAKES THE THREE GORGES DAM, THE WORLD'S LARGEST POWER STATION, AND THE DOWNSTREAM GEZHOUBA DAM, AS A CASE STUDY, BUILDS A JOINT OPERATION MODEL OF CASCADE RESERVOIRS, SIMULATES AND ANALYZES THE FEASIBILITY OF THE CASCADE RESERVOIRS TO IMPROVE THE SPAWNING CONDITIONS OF FISH IN THE DOWNSTREAM RIVER REACHES UNDER JOINT OPERATION AND DISCUSSES THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY.

HOWEVER, LIMITED INFORMATION EXISTS REGARDING THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF KELP HARVESTING, WHICH, IN TURN, LIMITS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION EFFORTS. HERE, WE EXAMINED THE ECOSYSTEM-LEVEL CONSEQUENCES OF THE ARTISANAL SUBTIDAL LESSONIA TRABECULATA FISHERY ALONG THE COAST OF CENTRAL CHILE DURING A 2-YEAR PERIOD, ASSESSING (1) THE CHANGE IN ADULT AND JUVENILE L. TRABECULATA DENSITY WITHIN HARVESTED AND NONHARVESTED (CONTROL) PLOTS (~90 M2), (2) THE IMPACT OF L. TRABECULATA HARVESTING ON REEF FISH AND MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES, AND (3) THE CHANGE IN DENSITY OF THE MOST ABUNDANT L. TRABECULATA-ASSOCIATED SPECIES. THE EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED OVER A 2-YEAR PERIOD, FROM DECEMBER 2016 TO MAY 2019. APPROXIMATELY 90% OF L. TRABECULATA WAS REMOVED BY AN EXPERIENCED KELP FISHERMAN IN EXPERIMENTAL PLOTS. AFTER 2 YEARS, L. TRABECULATA AND ITS ASSOCIATED COMMUNITY SHOWED A LACK OF RECOVERY IN THE HARVESTED PLOTS. WITHIN THESE PLOTS, THE AVERAGE ABUNDANCE OF THE ROCK SHRIMP, RHYNCHOCINETES TYPUS, AND THE HERBIVOROUS SNAIL, TEGULA TRIDENTATA, WAS GREATER THAN IN NONHARVESTED PLOTS AND THE PATTERN PERSISTED OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. THE DIFFERENCE IN ABUNDANCE OF ASSOCIATED SPECIES MAY BE KEY TO THE (LACK OF) RECOVERY OF L. TRABECULATA FORESTS. OUR STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPACT OF L. TRABECULATA HARVESTING ON ASSOCIATED FAUNA; HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS REMAIN REGARDING THE CAPACITY AND TIME FRAME TO REESTABLISH THE ORIGINAL BIOMASS OF L. TRABECULATA, AS WELL AS ITS ASSOCIATED FAUNA. THE MANAGEMENT OF L. TRABECULATA FISHERIES NEEDS TO ACCOUNT FOR ECOSYSTEM-WIDE IMPACTS IN ORDER TO BETTER MANAGE AND PROTECT VITAL COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

WE DEVELOPED AND TESTED A CONSERVATION PRIORITY INDEX (CPI) THAT RANKS HABITATS TO AID IN PRIORITIZING THEM FOR CONSERVATION. WE TESTED THE INDEX USING 1897 FISH SPECIES FROM 273 AFRICAN INLAND LAKES AND 34 COUNTRIES. IN THE INDEX, LAKE SURFACE AREA, RARITY, AND THEIR INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE (IUCN) RED LIST STATUS WERE INCORPORATED. WE RETRIEVED DATA FROM THE GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY INFORMATION FACILITY (GBIF) AND IUCN DATA REPOSITORIES. LAKE NYASA HAD THE HIGHEST SPECIES RICHNESS (424), FOLLOWED BY TANGANYIKA (391), NOKOUÉ (246), VICTORIA (216), AND AHÉMÉ (216). HOWEVER, LAKES OTJIKOTO AND GIUNAS HAD THE HIGHEST CPI OF 137.2 AND 52.1, RESPECTIVELY. LAKES WERE GROUPED INTO HIGH PRIORITY (CPI > 0.5; N = 56) AND LOW PRIORITY (CPI < 0.5; N = 217). THE MEDIAN SURFACE AREA BETWEEN PRIORITY CLASSES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT (W = 11,768, P <.05, EFFECT SIZE = 0.65). PREDICTION ACCURACY OF RANDOM FOREST (RF) AND EXTREME GRADIENT BOOSTING (XGBOOST) FOR PRIORITY CLASSES WERE 0.912 AND 0.954, RESPECTIVELY. BOTH MODELS EXHIBITED LAKE SURFACE AREA AS THE VARIABLE WITH THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE. CPI GENERALLY INCREASED WITH A DECREASE IN LAKE SURFACE AREA. THIS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO LESS ECOLOGICAL SUBSTITUTABILITY AND HIGHER EXPOSURE LEVELS OF ANTHROPOGENIC STRESSORS SUCH AS POLLUTION TO A SPECIES IN SMALLER LAKES. ALSO, THE HIGHEST SPECIES RICHNESS PER UNIT AREA WAS RECORDED FOR HIGH-PRIORITY LAKES. THUS, SMALLER HABITATS OR LAKES MAY BE PRIORITIZED FOR CONSERVATION ALTHOUGH LARGER WATERBODIES OR HABITATS SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED.

THE RESEARCH DATA WAS CONDUCTED DURING YEARS 2015–2017 USING QUESTIONNAIRE PROFORMA EMPLOYING STRUCTURED AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW MODELS. THE INFORMANTS BELONGED FROM INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES COMPRISING OF BOTH GENDERS WITH AGE RANGING FROM 35–105 YEARS. THE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED USING LOCAL TRANSLATOR OR GUIDE WHO KNEW THE DIALECTS OF ALL LOCAL LANGUAGES. THE STUDY PRODUCED ETHNOBOTANICAL INVENTORY OF 173 HERBAL SPECIES BELONGING TO 45 FAMILIES AND OUT OF THESE POACEAE WAS DOMINANT FAMILY WITH 27 SPECIES. IT WAS EXPLORED THAT MAXIMUM HERBAL SPECIES DEPICTED MULTI-USAGE ESPECIALLY FOOD, FODDER AND FUEL. AMONG 173 HERBAL PLANT SPECIES, 69% SPECIES WERE USED AS FODDER, 72% SPECIES AS FUEL SOURCE, 9.8% AS ETHNOVETERINARY MEDICINES, 16% FOR HOME CONSTRUCTION, 12% FOR COSMETICS, 5.2% AS HONEYBEE PLANTS AND 2.7% WERE USED AS FIBER SOURCE BY THE LOCAL PEOPLE. MANY LOCAL PLANTS HAVE BEEN IN PROMULGATION FOR CURE OF DIFFERENT DISEASES IN TRADITIONAL CULTURES SUCH AS FOR CURE OF STOMACH PROBLEMS, COUGH, CANCER, JAUNDICE, KIDNEY DISEASES, DIABETES, SNAKE BITING AND TOOTH PROBLEMS. DIFFERENT PARTS OF PLANTS SUCH AS LEAF, ROOT, STEM BARK, FLOWER, SEED AND GUMS ARE USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIFFERENT DISEASES BY THE LOCAL PEOPLE. THE MAJOR ALIMENTS BEING CURED ARE CLASSIFIED INTO 12 DISEASE CATEGORIES BY USING INFORMANT CONSENSUS FACTOR (ICF) PROTOCOL. ACCORDING TO ICF, THE HIGHEST NUMBERS OF PLANT SPECIES WERE USED AGAINST WOUND HEALING, SNAKE BITE, SKIN DISEASES, EYE DISEASES AND ASTHMA. FIDELITY LEVEL (FL) WAS ASSESSED TO CHECK THE RELIABILITY AND USE CONSISTENCY OF HERBAL DRUGS BY THE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES OF THE STUDY AREA. THE USE VALUE INDEX (UVI) OF DIFFERENT HERB SPECIES RANGED FROM 0.29 TO 0.57 WHILE THE HIGHEST VALUE WAS CALCULATED FOR ALTERNANTHERA PUNGENS L. (UVI: 0.57). RELATIVE FREQUENCY OF CITATION (RFC) VALUE WAS CALCULATED ON THE BASES OF THE RESPONSE OF THE INTERVIEWEES RECORDED DURING SURVEY IN CORRELATION WITH AUTHENTICATING OF TRADITIONAL DATA. THE RFC VALUES REPRESENTED THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES IN STUDY AREA ACCORDING TO THEIR USE VALUES. THE HIGHEST VALUE WAS CALCULATED FOR ALTERNANTHERA PUNGENS L.

THE WORLD HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO MEET THIS ISSUE BY DEVELOPING SEVERAL CULTIVATION TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS THE USE OF CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS AND ARABLE LAND CONVERSION INTO AGRICULTURAL LAND. HOWEVER, MOST OF THESE TECHNIQUES HAVE CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEMS SERVICES. RECENT DATA SUGGEST THAT BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION WITHIN AND AROUND AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS ARE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BOTH REDUCE BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND GUARANTEE CROP PRODUCTION. THIS LOGIC IS BASED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INCREASING PLANT DIVERSITY IN AND AROUND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS CAN LIMIT THE PEST ATTACK RATE AND INCREASE CROP YIELD. WE TESTED THIS HYPOTHESIS USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING ON EMPIRICAL DATA COLLECTED IN AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS AROUND THE PENDJARI BIOSPHERE RESERVE IN WEST AFRICA. WE MEASURED CROP DIVERSITY, CROP YIELD, ARTHROPOD PEST DIVERSITY, ABUNDANCE, THE RATE OF CROP HERBIVORY, AND THE DIVERSITY OF PLANTS IN SURROUNDING NATURAL VEGETATION IN 32 PERMANENT PLOTS. WE ESTIMATED ARTHROPOD DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE USING PITFALL TRAPS. WE FOUND A DIRECT POSITIVE EFFECT FOR PLANT DIVERSITY AND A DIRECT NEGATIVE EFFECT OF ARTHROPOD HERBIVORY ON CROP YIELD. THE DIVERSITY OF PLANTS IN SURROUNDING NATURAL VEGETATION HAD A DIRECT POSITIVE EFFECT ON ARTHROPOD PEST DIVERSITY BUT A MARGINAL NEGATIVE DIRECT EFFECT ON THE RATE OF CROP HERBIVORY. WE FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT DIRECT OR INDIRECT EFFECT FOR CROP DIVERSITY. OUR FINDINGS UNDERLINE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IMPROVEMENT.

INDIC.,1,"HABITAT LOSS IS A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS, CAUSING FRAGMENTATION INTO SMALL, ISOLATED PATCHES OF SUITABLE LAND COVER. THIS REDUCES THE PERMEABILITY OF LANDSCAPES TO THE MOVEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS AND REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF METAPOPULATION PERSISTENCE. QUANTIFYING FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY, THE ABILITY OF A FOCAL SPECIES TO MOVE BETWEEN RESOURCE PATCHES, IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL FOR CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTING A TECHNIQUE BASED ON ‘POPULATION SYNCHRONY’- THE DEGREE OF CORRELATION IN TIME-SERIES OF ANNUAL POPULATION GROWTH RATES BETWEEN DIFFERENT LONG-TERM MONITORING SITES, TO PROVIDE A MEASURE OF FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY. HOWEVER, SYNCHRONISED POPULATION DYNAMICS ARE NOT ONLY DRIVEN BY THE MOVEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN SITES, BUT ALSO SHARED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WHICH MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR. HERE, WE USE SPECIES SURVEY DATA FROM OVER FOUR DECADES TO INVESTIGATE AVERAGE LEVELS AND TEMPORAL TRENDS IN POPULATION SYNCHRONY FOR 58 BRITISH BIRD AND BUTTERFLY SPECIES. WE FIRST SHOW THAT POPULATION SYNCHRONY IS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH SYNCHRONY IN SOME SEASONAL CLIMATIC VARIABLES. ONCE WE ACCOUNTED FOR SPATIOTEMPORAL CLIMATIC PATTERNS, WE FOUND THAT SYNCHRONY IN BUTTERFLIES DECLINED OVER TIME BY 71% BETWEEN 1985 AND 2000 BUT INCREASED BY 64% IN RECENT YEARS. SYNCHRONY IN BIRDS SHOWED SOME DECLINE BETWEEN 1999 AND 2005, AFTER WHICH THERE APPEARS TO BEING RECOVERY, HOWEVER MOST SPECIES (74%) SHOW NO SIGNIFICANT OVERALL CHANGE IN SYNCHRONY. OUR PROPOSED INDICATOR PROVIDES A ‘SPECIES-EYE-VIEW’ OF FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY USING WIDELY AVAILABLE ABUNDANCE DATA.

HOWEVER, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EU FRAMEWORK THAT EXPLICITLY OBLIGES MEMBER STATES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OR TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN OBJECTIVES IN THIS FIELD. THIS ARTICLE FIRST SHOWS HOW ECOLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY HAS GRADUALLY EMERGED AS A SPATIAL PLANNING ISSUE, IN PARTICULAR THROUGH NATIONAL/FEDERAL AND/OR REGIONAL LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS, IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES (GERMANY, ITALY AND FRANCE). A FOCUS ON THE FRENCH CONTEXT AND ITS GREEN AND BLUE NETWORK POLICY THEN DEPICTS THE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES OBSERVED IN SPATIAL PLANNING AT THE REGIONAL, SUB-REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS.

ENVIRON. MANAGE.,1,"PRIORITIZING THREATENED SPECIES PROTECTION HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN EFFICIENT RESPONSE TO THE GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY CRISIS. WE USED IN-SITU CONSERVATION DATA TO PREDICT THE POTENTIAL HABITAT AREA OF FOUR FLAGSHIP SPECIES: THE GIANT PANDA (AILUROPODA MELANOLEUCA), GOLDEN MONKEY (RHINOPITHECUS ROXELLA QUINLINGENSIS), TAKIN (BUDORCAS TAXICOLOR BEDFORDI), AND CRESTED IBIS (NIPPONIA NIPPON). WE THEN DESIGNED SYSTEMATIC CONSERVATION PLANNING SCHEMES FOR VARIOUS SCENARIOS GIVEN SPECIES HABITAT PREFERENCES AND ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES AND CONDUCTED A COST-EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT. BROADLY, THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUITABLE HABITATS FOR GIANT PANDAS, GOLDEN MONKEYS, AND TAKINS EXHIBITED HIGH SPATIAL CONGRUENCE (CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS OF 0.59–0.90), AND AREAS OF HIGH CONGRUENCE WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE QINLING MOUNTAINS AT HIGH ELEVATION (>1500 M). BY CONTRAST, THE CRESTED IBIS WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED IN SPACE WITH ITS SYMPATRIC SPECIES (−0.47 TO −0.29). CRESTED IBIS HABITATS WERE CLUSTERED IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE REGION AT LOW ELEVATION (<1500 M). A HYPOTHETICAL CONSERVATION PRIORITY AREA (CPA) BASED ON THE GIANT PANDA, GOLDEN MONKEY, AND TAKIN INCLUDED 39.64% OF THE QINLING MOUNTAINS AND 100%, 99.99%, 99.59%, AND 7.84% OF THE SUITABLE HABITATS FOR GIANT PANDAS, GOLDEN MONKEYS, TAKINS, AND CRESTED IBISES, RESPECTIVELY. THE SAME AREA INCLUDED 99.07%, 70.87%, AND 39.96% OF THE HIGHLY IMPORTANT AREAS FOR THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES OF BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, WATER SUPPLY, AND SOIL RETENTION, RESPECTIVELY, AND ONLY 4.62%, 16.83%, AND 13.4% OF THE AREA WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH-DENSITY RESIDENTIAL AREA, IMPERVIOUS SURFACES, AND CROPLAND, RESPECTIVELY. THEREFORE, WE CONCLUDE THAT A CPA APPROACH BASED ON THE SPECIALIST SPECIES COULD RESULT IN EFFECTIVE, LOW-COST BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN THE QINLING MOUNTAINS. HOWEVER, WE NOTE THAT EXISTING PROTECTED AREAS ACCOUNT FOR ONLY 26.52% OF THE CPA. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE MAIN AREA OF THE PROPOSED QINLING NATIONAL PARK SHOULD BE BASED ON THE CPA DEVELOPED HERE. © 2021",114388,NA,JEVMA,"CHEN, J.; ACADEMY OF FORESTRY INVENTORY AND PLANNING, NO.18 HEPINGLI DONG JIE, DONGCHENG DISTRICT, CHINA; EMAIL: CHENJUNZHI@AFIP.COM.CN; LUAN, X.; SCHOOL OF ECOLOGY AND NATURE CONSERVATION, NO.35 TSINGHUA EAST ROAD, HAIDIAN DISTRICT, CHINA; EMAIL: LUANXIAOFENG@BJFU.EDU.CN",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.114388,NA,3014797,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,ACADEMIC PRESS,34972047,SCOPUS,"A FLAGSHIP SPECIES-BASED APPROACH TO EFFICIENT, COST-EFFECTIVE BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN THE QINLING MOUNTAINS, CHINA",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121855203&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2021.114388&partnerID=40&md5=f82b03800959b8044870e0e62bab1b04,305,2022,NA NA NA,J ENVIRON MANAGE,none,ACADEMY OF FORESTRY INVENTORY AND PLANNING;BEIJING FORESTRY UNIVERSITY;FIRST INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHY;SHAANXI INSTITUTE OF ZOOLOGY;SHAANXI INSTITUTE OF FORESTRY INVENTORY AND PLANNING;CHINESE RESEARCH ACADEMY OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES,NOTREPORTED;ACADEMY OF FORESTRY INVENTORY AND PLANNING;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;SCHOOL OF ECOLOGY AND NATURE CONSERVATION;NOTREPORTED,NA,"ZHUANG H, 2022, J ENVIRON MANAGE","ZHUANG H, 2022, J ENVIRON MANAGE"

EUROPE HAS SET ITS OWN POLICY TARGETS TO ACHIEVE GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS (GES) OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS BY IMPLEMENTING THE MARINE STRATEGY FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE (MSFD) ACROSS MEMBER STATES. WE COMBINED AN EXTENSIVE DATASET ACROSS FIVE MEDITERRANEAN ECOREGIONS INCLUDING 26 MARINE PROTECTED AREAS (MPAS), THEIR REFERENCE UNPROTECTED AREAS, AND A NO-TRAWL CASE STUDY. OUR AIM WAS TO ASSESS IF MPAS REACH GES, IF THEIR EFFECTS ARE LOCAL OR CAN BE DETECTED AT ECOREGION LEVEL OR UP TO A MEDITERRANEAN SCALE, AND WHICH ARE THE ECOSYSTEM COMPONENTS DRIVING GES ACHIEVEMENT. THIS WAS UNDERTAKEN BY USING THE ANALYTICAL TOOL NEAT (NESTED ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS ASSESSMENT TOOL), WHICH ALLOWS AN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT OF THE STATUS OF MARINE SYSTEMS. WE ADOPTED AN ECOSYSTEM APPROACH BY INTEGRATING DATA FROM SEVERAL ECOSYSTEM COMPONENTS: THE SEAGRASS POSIDONIA OCEANICA, MACROALGAE, SEA URCHINS AND FISH. THRESHOLDS TO DEFINE THE GES WERE SET BY DEDICATED WORKSHOPS AND LITERATURE REVIEW. IN THE WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN, MOST MPAS ARE IN GOOD/HIGH STATUS, WITH P. OCEANICA AND FISH DRIVING THIS RESULT WITHIN MPAS. HOWEVER, GES IS ACHIEVED ONLY AT A LOCAL LEVEL, AND THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA, AS A WHOLE, RESULTS IN A MODERATE ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS. MACROALGAL FORESTS ARE OVERALL IN BAD CONDITION, CONFIRMING THEIR STATUS AT RISK. THE RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE ASSUMPTION THAT DISCRETE OBSERVATIONS OVER SMALL SPATIAL SCALES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TOTAL EXTENSION INVESTIGATED. THIS CALLS FOR LARGE-SCALE, DEDICATED ASSESSMENTS TO REALISTICALLY DETECT ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS CHANGES UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. UNDERSTANDING MPAS EFFECTIVENESS IN REACHING GES IS CRUCIAL TO ASSESS THEIR ROLE AS SENTINEL OBSERVATORIES OF MARINE SYSTEMS. MPAS AND TRAWLING BANS CAN LOCALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ATTAINMENT OF GES AND TO THE FULFILLMENT OF THE MSFD OBJECTIVES. BUILDING CONFIDENCE IN SETTING THRESHOLDS BETWEEN GES AND NON-GES, INVESTING IN LONG-TERM MONITORING, INCREASING THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF SAMPLING AREAS, RETHINKING AND BROADENING THE SCOPE OF COMPLEMENTARY TOOLS OF PROTECTION (E.G., NATURA 2000 SITES), ARE INDICATED AS SOLUTIONS TO AMELIORATE THE STATUS OF THE BASIN. © 2021",114370,NA,JEVMA,"FRASCHETTI, S.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY, ITALY; EMAIL: SIMONETTA.FRASCHETTI@UNINA.IT",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.114370,"INTERREGINTERREG, 8022 EUROPEAN COMMISSIONEUROPEAN COMMISSION, EC, 110661/2018/794286/SUB/ENV, SI2.721917 EUROPEAN COOPERATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYEUROPEAN COOPERATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, COST REGIONE CAMPANIAREGIONE CAMPANIA, ISSPA 2.51 MINISTERIO DE CIENCIA E INNOVACIÓNMINISTERIO DE CIENCIA E INNOVACIÓN, MICINN",3014797,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,NA,NA,9,NA,NA,ACADEMIC PRESS,34968935,SCOPUS,AN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT OF THE GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL STATUS OF MEDITERRANEAN MARINE PROTECTED AREAS,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121780251&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2021.114370&partnerID=40&md5=ffc2d48612b5aea572f6c1eb62c51dd3,305,2022,"THIS ARTICLE WAS UNDERTAKEN WITHIN THE COST ACTION 15121 MARCONS ( HTTP://WWW.MARCONS-COST.EU , EUROPEAN COOPERATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY), THE INTERREG MED AMARE PLUS (REF: 8022) AND THE PROJECT PO FEAMP 2014-2020 INNOVAZIONE, SVILUPPO E SOSTENIBILITÀ NEL SETTORE DELLA PESCA E DELL’ACQUACOLTURA PER LA REGIONE CAMPANIA ( ISSPA 2.51 ).

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,1,"AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A VARIETY OF HABITATS RESULTING FROM MAN-MADE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. PROGRESSING AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION IS LEADING TO A REDUCTION IN NATURAL AND SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS, RESULTING IN TURN IN A LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY. IN FARMLAND, NATURAL HABITATS SUCH AS FIELD MARGINS, HEDGEROWS, AND MEADOWS ARE PROGRESSIVELY DECLINING OR BEING TRANSFORMED. THERE IS A NEED FOR REGIONALLY ADJUSTED SCHEMES THAT BALANCE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION DUE TO STRONG DIFFERENCES EVEN WITHIN ONE COUNTRY. WE PRESENT A POTENTIAL TOOL THAT CAN MITIGATE BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN FARMLAND ECOSYSTEMS. IN THIS STUDY, WE COMPARED TRANSECTS ON THREE DIFFERENT HABITAT TYPES: UNUSED RAILWAY LINES, DIRT ROAD VERGES AND FIELDS IN TERMS OF OVERALL, FARMLAND AND OPEN LAND BIRD SPECIES ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS AND SHANNON-WIENER DIVERSITY INDEX AS WELL AS COMMUNITY COMPOSITION IN INTENSIVELY MANAGED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. WE PREDICTED THAT 1) BIRD ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY WOULD BE GREATER IN VEGETATION STRUCTURE ALONG UNUSED RAILWAY LINES DUE TO THEIR SPONTANEOUS VEGETATION CHARACTER THAN IN OTHER HABITATS, AND 2) BIRD COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WOULD BE DIFFERENT BETWEEN THREE HABITAT TYPES (UNUSED RAILWAY LINES, FARMLAND ROADS AND TRANSECTS IN FARMING AREAS). OUR FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THAT HABITATS ALONG UNUSED RAILWAY LINES PROVIDE A SUITABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR FARMLAND BIRDS, INCREASING BIRD DIVERSITY IN THE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE AND PLAYING A WIDER ROLE IN BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. VEGETATION STRUCTURES ALONG UNUSED RAILWAY LINES MAY ACT AS ALTERNATIVE REFUGES FOR BIRDS IN EACH SEASON, PROVIDING FOOD RESOURCES, NESTING, SHELTER, PERCHING, SINGING, AND RESTING SITES AS WELL AS CONSTITUTE A KIND OF ECOLOGICAL CORRIDOR RUNNING WITHIN AN INTENSIVELY USED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE. © 2021 ELSEVIER B.V.",107820,NA,AEEND,"DYLEWSKI; DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY, WOJSKA POLSKIEGO 71C, POLAND",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.agee.2021.107820,"NARODOWYM CENTRUM NAUKINARODOWYM CENTRUM NAUKI, NCN, 2016/N/NZ8/01289",1678809,"AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT",ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,"UNUSED RAILWAY LINES AS A CONTRIBUTOR TO BIRD ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY IN INTENSIVELY MANAGED FARMLAND",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120900066&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2021.107820&partnerID=40&md5=fe7425bb28a17bd5fb90845350a3fa36,326,2022,"WE WISH TO THANK ANDRZEJ WUCZYŃSKI AND MICHAŁ ŻMIHORSKI FOR HELPFUL COMMENTS ON THE FIRST VERSION OF THE MANUSCRIPT.

HOWEVER, THE LINK BETWEEN BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND CHANGES IN ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD. WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE EXCLUSION OF VERTEBRATES AFFECTS THE DECOMPOSITION RATES OF DIFFERENT LITTER TYPES (GRASS, A PIONEER SPECIES AND A MIX OF LITTERS FROM A WELL PRESERVED SECONDARY FOREST). TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, WE PLACED LITTER BAGS INSIDE ARTIFICIAL EXCLUSION PLOTS THAT WERE BUILT IN TWO TYPES OF VEGETATION COVERAGE (ABANDONED PASTURELAND AND PRESERVED FOREST) IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST OF SOUTHEAST BRAZIL. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT VERTEBRATE EXCLUSION WILL CHANGE DECOMPOSITION RATES OF DIFFERENT LITTER TYPES DUE TO THE TOP-DOWN CASCADE EFFECT ON SOIL INVERTEBRATES. WE FOUND OUT THAT VERTEBRATE EXCLUSION DID NOT AFFECT DECOMPOSITION RATES, POSSIBLY DUE TO THE OVERLAP OF ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN THE SOIL FAUNA RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECOMPOSITION PROCESS.

RES.,1,"CONTEXT: INVASIVE SPECIES ARE MAJOR DRIVERS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS, REQUIRING MANAGEMENT TO REDUCE THEIR ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS. POPULATION GENETICS CAN BE APPLIED TO DELINEATE MANAGEMENT UNITS, PROVIDING INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP PLAN AND IMPROVE CONTROL STRATEGIES. AIM: THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO USE A GENETIC APPROACH TO TEST THE EXISTENCE OF THREE PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED SAMBAR DEER POPULATIONS IN SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA. IN DOING SO, THE STUDY AIMS TO DELINEATE MANAGEMENT UNITS OF SAMBAR DEER IN SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA. METHODS: SAMBAR DEER DNA WAS SOURCED OPPORTUNISTICALLY FROM TISSUE SAMPLES AND TARGETED SCAT COLLECTION. SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM THREE AREAS IN VICTORIA, SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA: MT COLE (MC), FRENCH ISLAND (FI) AND EASTERN VICTORIA (EV). CONTEMPORARY POPULATION STRUCTURE WAS ASSESSED USING A SUITE OF 11 POLYMORPHIC MICROSATELLITE MARKERS. THE NUMBER OF MATERNAL SAMBAR DEER LINEAGES IN SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA WAS INVESTIGATED THROUGH SEQUENCING OF THE MITOCHONDRIAL (MT)DNA CONTROL REGION. KEY RESULTS: THREE DISTINCT GENETIC CLUSTERS WERE IDENTIFIED. DIFFERENTIATION AMONG INFERRED CLUSTERS WAS FOUND TO BE HIGH, WITH FST RANGING FROM 0.24 BETWEEN EV AND FI CLUSTERS AND 0.48 BETWEEN MC AND FI CLUSTERS. TWO MTDNA HAPLOTYPES WERE IDENTIFIED; R.U1 WAS FOUND THROUGHOUT EV AND FI, AND R.U2 WAS UNIQUE TO MC. DNA ISOLATED FROM SCATS PROVIDED RELIABLE DATA AND PROVED CRITICAL FOR SAMPLING AREAS WHERE HUNTING AND CULLING OF DEER ARE NOT GENERALLY UNDERTAKEN. CONCLUSIONS: THREE GENETICALLY DISTINCT SAMBAR DEER MANAGEMENT UNITS IN SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA ARE DEFINED-MC, FI AND EV.

THIS IS PARTICULARLY NECESSARY CONSIDERING THAT CHRONIC HUMAN DISTURBANCE IS A THREAT TO BIODIVERSITY WORLDWIDE. DEPENDING ON HOW SPECIES TOLERATE AND ADAPT TO SUCH DISTURBANCE, ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES WILL BE MORE OR LESS AFFECTED. BATS ARE A SPECIES-RICH AND FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE GROUP, WITH IMPORTANT ROLES IN ECOSYSTEMS, AND ARE THEREFORE RECOGNIZED AS A GOOD MODEL GROUP FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. THEIR POPULATIONS HAVE DECREASED IN SEVERAL REGIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE TROPICS, AND ARE THREATENED BY INCREASING HUMAN DISTURBANCE. USING PASSIVE ACOUSTIC MONITORING, WE ASSESSED HOW THE SPECIES-RICH AERIAL INSECTIVOROUS BATS—ESSENTIAL FOR INSECT SUPPRESSION SERVICES—RESPOND TO CHRONIC HUMAN DISTURBANCE IN THE CAATINGA DRY FORESTS OF BRAZIL, AN AREA POTENTIALLY HARBORING CA. 100 BAT SPECIES (NEARLY 50% ARE INSECTIVOROUS), BUT WITH > 60% ITS AREA COMPOSED OF ANTHROPOGENIC ECOSYSTEMS UNDER CHRONIC PRESSURE. ACOUSTIC DATA FOR BAT ACTIVITY WAS COLLECTED AT RESEARCH SITES WITH VARYING AMOUNTS OF CHRONIC HUMAN DISTURBANCE (E.G., LIVESTOCK GRAZING AND FIREWOOD GATHERING). THE INTENSITY OF THE DISTURBANCE IS INDICATED BY THE GLOBAL MULTI-METRIC CAD INDEX (GMDI). USING ANIMAL SOUND IDENTIFIER (ASI) SOFTWARE, WE IDENTIFIED 18 DIFFERENT BAT TAXON UNITS. USING HIERARCHICAL MODELING OF SPECIES COMMUNITIES (HMSC), WE FOUND TRENDS IN THE ASSOCIATION OF THE DISTURBANCE GRADIENT WITH SPECIES RICHNESS AND BAT ACTIVITY: SPECIES RICHNESS WAS HIGHER AT SITES WITH HIGHER HUMAN DISTURBANCE, WHEREAS BAT ACTIVITY DECREASED WITH INCREASING HUMAN DISTURBANCE. ADDITIONALLY, WE OBSERVED TAXON-SPECIFIC RESPONSES TO HUMAN DISTURBANCE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE ON THE INSECTIVOROUS BAT FAUNA IN THE CAATINGA ARE NOT HOMOGENEOUS AND A SPECIES-SPECIFIC APPROACH IS NECESSARY WHEN ASSESSING THE RESPONSES OF LOCAL BATS TO HUMAN DISTURBANCES IN TROPICAL DRY FORESTS, AND IN OTHER BIOMES UNDER HUMAN PRESSURE.

IN AFRICA, THESE THREATS ARE ESPECIALLY SEVERE. FOR INSTANCE, DEMAND TO CONVERT LAND INTO AGRICULTURAL USES IS LEADING TO INCREASING AREAS OF DRYLANDS IN SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL AFRICA BEING TRANSFORMED FOR AGRICULTURE. IN ZIMBABWE, A LAND REFORM PROGRAMME PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THE BIODIVERSITY RESPONSE TO ABRUPT HABITAT MODIFICATION IN PART OF A 91,000 HA DRYLAND AREA OF SEMI-NATURAL SAVANNAH USED SINCE 1930 FOR LOW-LEVEL CATTLE RANCHING. SMALL-SCALE SUBSISTENCE FARMS WERE CREATED DURING 2001–2002 IN 65,000 HA OF THIS AREA, WITH RANCHING CONTINUING IN THE REMAINING UNCHANGED AREA. WE MEASURED THE COMPOSITIONS OF BIRD COMMUNITIES IN FARMED AND RANCHED LAND OVER 8 YEARS, COMMENCING ONE DECADE AFTER SUBSISTENCE FARMS WERE ESTABLISHED. OVER THE STUDY PERIOD, REPEATED COUNTS WERE MADE ALONG THE SAME 45 TRANSECTS TO ASSESS SPECIES' POPULATION CHANGES THAT MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM TRAIT-FILTERING RESPONSES TO HABITAT DISTURBANCE. IN 2012, AVIAN SPECIES' RICHNESS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER (+8.8%) IN THE FARMLAND BIRD COMMUNITY THAN IN THE UNMODIFIED RANCHED AREA. TEMPORAL TRENDS OVER THE STUDY PERIOD SHOWED INCREASED SPECIES' RICHNESS IN THE RANCHED AREA (+12.3%) AND FARMLAND (+6.8%). THERE WERE INCREASED ABUNDANCES IN BIRDS OF MOST SIZES, AND IN ALL FEEDING GUILDS. NEW SPECIES DID NOT ADD NEW FUNCTIONAL TRAITS, AND NO SPECIES WITH DISTINCTIVE TRAITS WERE LOST IN EITHER AREA. AS A RESULT, SPECIES' DIVERSITY REDUCED, AND FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY INCREASED BY 6.8% IN RANCHED LAND. BY 2020, TWO DECADES AFTER PART OF THE RANCHED SAVANNAH WAS CONVERTED INTO FARMLAND, THE COMPOSITIONS OF THE TWO BIRD COMMUNITIES HAD BOTH CHANGED AND BECAME MORE SIMILAR. THE BROADLY BENIGN IMPACT ON BIRDS OF LAND CONVERSION INTO SUBSISTENCE FARMS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL OF AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY IN THE FARMLAND AND THE LARGE REGIONAL POOL OF NONSPECIALIST BIRD SPECIES. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

USING THE NON-METRIC MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING, WE TESTED WHETHER THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE COMPOSITION OF FORAGING GUILDS BETWEEN HABITATS. COMMERCIAL POLYCULTURE COFFEE FIELDS CAN SUSTAIN LEVELS OF BIRD ABUNDANCE, DIVERSITY, AND RICHNESS COMPARABLE TO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS UNDER NATURAL FOREST, AND HIGHER THAN SUN COFFEE AND SHADED MONOCULTURE COFFEE, AND OF OTHER HUMAN MODIFIED HABITATS SUCH AS CROP/FRUIT FIELDS AND TREE FARMS. COFFEE AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS HAVE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF NECTARIVORES, INSECTIVORES, AND FRUGIVORES THAN OTHER SYSTEMS THAT CAN SUSTAIN HIGH DIVERSITY AND RICHNESS OF BIRDS SUCH AS PADDY FIELDS THAT MAINLY HAVE GRANIVORES AND CARNIVORES. COMPLEX POLYCULTURES CAN REPRESENT AN AVENUE FOR THE FUTURE OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE IN CONDITIONS WHERE DEFORESTATION RATES ARE HIGH AND IN CROPS SUCH AS COFFEE, WHICH MAINTAIN HIGH YIELD IN THE PRESENCE OF DIVERSE SHADE. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.

PASSIVE ACOUSTIC MONITORING (PAM) HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR THE COLLECTION OF DATA PASSIVELY, OBJECTIVELY, AND CONTINUOUSLY ACROSS LARGE AREAS AND FOR EXTENDED PERIODS. HOWEVER, IT CONTINUES TO BE A DIFFICULT SUBJECT DUE TO THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT AUDIO RECORDINGS CONTAIN. MOST EXISTING AUTOMATED ANALYSIS METHODS HAVE LIMITATIONS IN THEIR APPLICATION IN URBAN AREAS, WITH UNCLEAR ECOLOGICAL RELEVANCE AND EFFICACY. TO BETTER SUPPORT URBAN FOREST BIODIVERSITY MONITORING, WE PRESENT A NOVEL METHODOLOGY FOR AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTING BIRD VOCALIZATIONS FROM SPECTROGRAMS OF FIELD AUDIO RECORDINGS, INTEGRATING OBJECT-BASED CLASSIFICATION. WE APPLIED THIS APPROACH TO ACOUSTIC DATA FROM AN URBAN FOREST IN BEIJING AND ACHIEVED AN ACCURACY OF 93.55% (±4.78%) IN VOCALIZATION RECOGNITION WHILE REQUIRING LESS THAN 1/8 OF THE TIME NEEDED FOR TRADITIONAL INSPECTION. THE DIFFERENCE IN EFFICIENCY WOULD BECOME MORE SIGNIFICANT AS THE DATA SIZE INCREASES BECAUSE OBJECT-BASED CLASSIFICATION ALLOWS FOR BATCH PROCESSING OF SPECTROGRAMS. USING THE EXTRACTED VOCALIZATIONS, A SERIES OF ACOUSTIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF BIRD-VOCALIZATION SYLLABLES (SYLLABLE FEATURE METRICS, SFMS) COULD BE CALCULATED TO BETTER QUANTIFY ACOUSTIC EVENTS AND DESCRIBE THE SOUNDSCAPE. A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SFMS AND BIODIVERSITY INDICES WAS FOUND, WITH 57% OF THE VARIANCE IN SPECIES RICHNESS, 41% IN SHANNON’S DIVERSITY INDEX AND 38% IN SIMPSON’S DIVERSITY INDEX BEING EXPLAINED BY SFMS.

ECOL.,1,"CONTEXT: HABITAT LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION ARE MAIN DRIVERS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND ARE OCCURRING AT AN ACCELERATING RATE GLOBALLY. CARNIVORES ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO PERSECUTION AND CONFLICT WITH HUMANS, TYPICALLY RESIDE IN LOW DENSITIES AND REQUIRE LARGE AREAS FOR CORE HABITAT AND DISPERSAL, WHICH MAKES THEM ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO HABITAT LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION. OBJECTIVES: THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES, MAPS AND ANALYSES HABITAT CORE AREAS AND CONNECTIVITY LINKAGES FOR THREE MOUNTAIN-RESIDING CARNIVORE SPECIES OF HIGH CONSERVATION IMPORTANCE IN IRAN: PERSIAN LEOPARD (PANTHERA PARDUS SAXICOLOR), EURASIAN LYNX (LYNX LYNX) AND PALLAS’S CAT (OTOCOLOBUS MANUL). METHODS: WE USED ENSEMBLE HABITAT SUITABILITY MODELING, AND COMPARED THE ACCURACY OF ENSEMBLE MODELS WITH SEVEN SEPARATE MODELS BASED ON AUC AND TSS. WE APPLIED RESISTANT KERNEL AND FACTORIAL LEAST-COST PATH ANALYSES TO IDENTIFY POPULATION CORE AREAS AND CORRIDORS ACROSS THE FULL DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE THREE SPECIES IN IRAN. RESULTS: MEAN ANNUAL TEMPERATURE, VEGETATION GREENNESS (NDVI), AND SLOPE WERE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR VARIABLES FOR ALL THREE SPECIES. WE FOUND ENSEMBLE MODELING OUTCOMPETED ALL SINGLE-METHOD MODELS IN TERMS OF AUC. WE FOUND LOW OVERLAP BETWEEN PREDICTED CORRIDOR LOCATIONS OF OUR MODELED SPECIES WITH PROTECTED AREAS. CONCLUSIONS: GIVEN THE FRAGMENTED POPULATIONS OF OUR STUDIED SPECIES IN IRAN, CONSERVING THEM WILL REQUIRE INTEGRATED LANDSCAPE-LEVEL MANAGEMENT TO PROTECT CORRIDORS AND ENHANCE CONNECTIVITY, ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE OF PROTECTED AREAS. OPTIMIZED LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT TO CONSERVE THESE SPECIES WILL LIKELY PROMOTE CONSERVATION OF MONTANE LANDSCAPES AND THEIR INHABITANTS IN IRAN. © 2021, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER NATURE B.V.",NA,NA,LAECE,"MOHAMMADI, A.; DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, IRAN; EMAIL: ARMOHAMMADI1989@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1007/s10980-021-01386-5,NA,9212973,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,15,2,411-430,SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,COMPARISON OF HABITAT SUITABILITY AND CONNECTIVITY MODELLING FOR THREE CARNIVORES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN IN AN IRANIAN MONTANE LANDSCAPE,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123936796&doi=10.1007%2fs10980-021-01386-5&partnerID=40&md5=aac935dc7909c57c4994ed6ccedf3e51,37,2022,WE ARE GRATEFUL TO GAME WARDENS THAT HAVE DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO SAVE ENDANGERED ANIMALS AND SHARING THEIR VALUABLE DATA WITH US.

TO MINIMISE BIODIVERSITY LOSS, CONSERVATION MANAGERS SHOULD IDENTIFY SPECIES VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND PRIORITISE THEIR PROTECTION. HERE, WE ESTIMATE CLIMATIC SUITABILITY FOR TWO SPECIES-RICH TAXONOMIC GROUPS, THEN USE PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES TO ASSESS VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE. LOCATION: AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND (NZ). TAXA: NZ LIZARDS: DIPLODACTYLID GECKOS AND EUGONGYLINAE SKINKS. METHODS: WE BUILT CORRELATIVE SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS (SDMS) FOR NZ GECKOS AND SKINKS TO ESTIMATE CLIMATIC SUITABILITY UNDER CURRENT CLIMATE AND 2070 FUTURE CLIMATE SCENARIOS. WE THEN USED BAYESIAN PHYLOGENETIC MIXED MODELS (BPMMS) TO ASSESS VULNERABILITY FOR BOTH GROUPS WITH PREDICTOR VARIABLES FOR LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS (BODY SIZE AND ACTIVITY PHASE) AND CURRENT DISTRIBUTION (ELEVATION AND LATITUDE). WE EXPLORED TWO SCENARIOS: AN UNLIMITED DISPERSAL SCENARIO, WHERE PROJECTIONS TRACK CLIMATE, AND A NO-DISPERSAL SCENARIO, WHERE PROJECTIONS ARE RESTRICTED TO AREAS CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED AS SUITABLE. RESULTS: SDMS PROJECTED VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE FOR MOST MODELLED LIZARDS. FOR SPECIES' RANGES PROJECTED TO DECLINE IN CLIMATICALLY SUITABLE AREAS, AVERAGE DECREASES WERE BETWEEN 42% AND 46% FOR GECKOS AND 33% AND 52% FOR SKINKS, ALTHOUGH AREA DID INCREASE OR REMAIN STABLE FOR A MINORITY OF SPECIES. FOR THE NO-DISPERSAL SCENARIO, THE AVERAGE DECREASE FOR GECKOS WAS 37%–52% AND FOR SKINKS WAS 33%–52%. OUR BPMMS SHOWED PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL IN CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY FOR BOTH GROUPS, WITH ELEVATION INCREASING VULNERABILITY FOR GECKOS, AND BODY SIZE REDUCING VULNERABILITY FOR SKINKS. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: NEW ZEALAND LIZARDS SHOWED VARIABLE VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE, WITH MOST SPECIES' RANGES PREDICTED TO DECREASE. FOR SPECIES WHOSE SUITABLE CLIMATIC SPACE IS PROJECTED TO DISAPPEAR FROM WITHIN THEIR CURRENT RANGE, MANAGED RELOCATION COULD BE CONSIDERED TO ESTABLISH POPULATIONS IN REGIONS THAT WILL BE SUITABLE UNDER FUTURE CLIMATES. © 2022 JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.",NA,NA,JBIOD,"JARVIE, S.; TE PAPA ATAWHAI, NEW ZEALAND; EMAIL: SJARVIE@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1111/jbi.14314,"CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATIONCALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION, DOC AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCILAUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL, ARC, FT200100108",3050270,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,3,2,431-442,JOHN WILEY AND SONS INC,NA,SCOPUS,VARIABLE VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN NEW ZEALAND LIZARDS,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123829001&doi=10.1111%2fjbi.14314&partnerID=40&md5=15d11cde92529cbb4f402d0ccc3fe21a,49,2022,"FOR OCCURRENCE RECORDS AND TISSUE SAMPLES, WE THANK TE PAPA ATAWHAI | DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION (DOC), TONY JEWELL, MARIEKE LETTINK, DYLAN VAN WINKEL AND NUMEROUS OTHERS.

SUBULATUM HAD LITTLE IMPACT. INCREASING SPECIES RICHNESS DECREASED LITTER DECOMPOSITION EXCEPT UNDER INTENSIVE DROUGHT. A STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL SHOWED THAT DROUGHT AND SPECIES RICHNESS AFFECTED LITTER DECOMPOSITION INDIRECTLY THROUGH CHANGES IN LITTER NITROGEN CONCENTRATION RATHER THAN BY ALTERING QUANTITY AND DIVERSITY OF SOIL MESO-FAUNA OR SOIL PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES. THE SLOWED LITTER DECOMPOSITION UNDER HIGH SPECIES DIVERSITY ORIGINATED FROM A SAMPLING EFFECT, SPECIFICALLY FROM LOW LITTER NITROGEN CONCENTRATIONS IN THE TWO DOMINANT SPECIES.

AS INVASION RATES ACCELERATE WORLDWIDE, UNDERSTANDING PAST INVASION DYNAMICS IS ESSENTIAL TO INFORM PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE INVADERS AND IMPACTS. OWING TO A HIGH DIVERSITY OF PATHWAYS AND CURRENT BIOSECURITY GAPS, AQUATIC SYSTEMS NEAR URBAN CENTRES ARE ESPECIALLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ALIEN SPECIES ESTABLISHMENTS. HERE, WE COMPILED AND COMPARED ALIEN SPECIES LISTS FOR THREE DIFFERENT AQUATIC RECIPIENT REGIONS SPANNING THE NORTH ATLANTIC: CHESAPEAKE BAY, GREAT LAKES-ST. LAWRENCE RIVER AND NORTH AND BALTIC SEAS. EACH SYSTEM IS A MAJOR TRADE CENTRE, WITH A HISTORY OF INVASIONS, AND CHARACTERIZED BY A STRONG NATURAL SALINITY GRADIENT. OUR GOAL WAS TO COMPARE THE ALIEN SPECIES ACROSS SYSTEMS, TO TEST FOR SIMILARITIES IN THE TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION AND GEOGRAPHIC ORIGIN AS WELL AS SPECIES OVERLAP AMONG THE THREE REGIONS. WE SELECTED SPECIFIC MACROINVERTEBRATE, ALGAL AND FISH TAXA FOR ANALYSIS, TO CONTROL FOR UNEVEN TAXONOMIC AND BIOGEOGRAPHIC RESOLUTION ACROSS REGIONS. CUMULATIVELY, WE IDENTIFIED 326 INDIVIDUAL ALIEN SPECIES ESTABLISHED IN THESE AQUATIC SYSTEMS, WITH THE NORTH AND BALTIC SEAS MOST INVADED OVERALL (163), FOLLOWED BY GREAT LAKES-ST. LAWRENCE RIVER (84) AND CHESAPEAKE BAY (79). MOST INVASIONS WERE FROM PONTO-CASPIAN, EURASIAN, NORTHWEST PACIFIC, NORTHWEST ATLANTIC AND NORTH AMERICAN ORIGINS, AND MOSTLY COMPRISED ARTHROPODA, CHORDATA, MOLLUSCA AND ANNELIDA. HOWEVER, ORIGINS AND TAXONOMIES DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG DESTINATIONS, WITH PONTO-CASPIAN SPECIES PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL INVADERS TO THE NORTH AND BALTIC SEAS THEN GREAT LAKES-ST. LAWRENCE RIVER, BUT LESS SO TO CHESAPEAKE BAY. NEVERTHELESS, APPROXIMATELY EIGHT-TENTHS OF INVADERS ESTABLISHED IN ONLY ONE REGION, INDICATING DISPARATE INVASION PATTERNS AND A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE ALIENS TO ACCRUE FROM INCREASINGLY DIVERSE SOURCE POOLS AND PATHWAYS.

AS SUCH, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT RESEARCHERS BETTER UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS AFFECTING SOIL C. INCREASING EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THAT ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN (N) DEPOSITION CAN CAUSE DRAMATIC CHANGES IN GRASSLAND SOIL C. IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER HERBIVORE GRAZING, A PRIMARY MEANS TO MANAGE AND UTILIZE GRASSLAND RESOURCES, CAN REGULATE THE EFFECTS OF N DEPOSITION ON SOIL C, AND WHETHER THESE EFFECTS ARE DEPENDENT ON PLANT COMMUNITY DIVERSITY. HERE, WE EXAMINED THE JOINT EFFECTS OF HERBIVORE GRAZING AND N-ADDITION ON SOIL ORGANIC C (SOC) STOCKS IN TWO TYPES OF COMMUNITIES WITH LOW AND HIGH PLANT DIVERSITY RESPECTIVELY. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE EFFECTS OF N-ADDITION AND ITS COMBINATION WITH HERBIVORE GRAZING ON GRASSLAND SOC WERE INCONSISTENT IN THE TWO TYPES OF COMMUNITIES. IN THE LOW-DIVERSITY COMMUNITY, N-ADDITION GREATLY DECREASED SOC STOCKS, WHILE GRAZING SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IT. ADDITIONALLY, THE GRAZING-INDUCED INCREASE IN SOIL C STOCKS IN THE PRESENCE OF N-ADDITION WAS SO GREAT THAT IT COMPLETELY COUNTERACTED THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SOC INDUCED BY N-ADDITION. HOWEVER, IN THE HIGH-DIVERSITY COMMUNITY, WE OBSERVED NO EFFECTS OF N-ADDITION ON SOC AND GRAZING INCREASED SOC ONLY IN THE ABSENCE OF N-ADDITION AND HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN THE PRESENCE OF N-ADDITION. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT INCREASED N DEPOSITION CAN TRIGGER A REMARKABLE REDUCTION IN SOIL C SEQUESTRATION IN GRASSLANDS WITH LOW PLANT DIVERSITY, BUT THAT HERBIVORE GRAZING CAN OFFSET THIS DECLINE, WHICH MAY HELP TO MITIGATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CAUSED BY ATMOSPHERIC N DEPOSITION. AS A RESULT, WE SUGGEST THAT MODERATE HERBIVORE GRAZING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS AN EFFECTIVE GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT MEASURE FOR MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING GRASSLAND SOIL C SEQUESTRATION AS THE INCREASING GLOBAL CHANGES SUCH AS ELEVATED ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE, N DEPOSITION AND BIODIVERSITY LOSSES THREAT. © 2021 BRITISH ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY",NA,NA,JAPEA,"ZHANG, M.; INSTITUTE OF GRASSLAND SCIENCE, CHINA; EMAIL: ZHANGMN443@NENU.EDU.CN; WANG, L.; INSTITUTE OF GRASSLAND SCIENCE, CHINA; EMAIL: WANGL890@NENU.EDU.CN",ARTICLE,10.1111/1365-2664.14066,"2013‐373 B16011 NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA, NSFC, 31772652, 31802113",218901,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,2,2,483-491,JOHN WILEY AND SONS INC,NA,SCOPUS,HERBIVORE GRAZING MITIGATES THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF NITROGEN DEPOSITION ON SOIL ORGANIC CARBON IN LOW-DIVERSITY GRASSLAND,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118476321&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2664.14066&partnerID=40&md5=97801016ffa8d67fa9012715fc38dfe2,59,2022,"WE ACKNOWLEDGE SUPPORT FROM THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (NO. 31772652, 31802113), THE PROGRAM FOR INTRODUCING TALENTS TO UNIVERSITIES (B16011) AND THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION INNOVATION TEAM DEVELOPMENT PLAN (2013‐373).

PROJECTED FUTURE GLOBAL DEMANDS FOR FOOD, FIBER AND BIOENERGY WILL REQUIRE ENHANCEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, BUT FAVORING BIODIVERSITY-BASED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES GENERALLY REMAINS UNDERUTILIZED IN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICE. IN ADDITION, AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION IS A KEY DRIVER OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS. A SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE PREVENTING THE ADOPTION OF ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE PRACTICES IS A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPECIES DELIVERING THE SERVICES. INSECTIVOROUS BATS HAVE LONG BEEN SUGGESTED TO REGULATE INSECT PEST POPULATIONS AND MAY BE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF BIODIVERSITY-BASED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. BATS MAY ALSO SERVE AS AGENTS OF INSECT PEST SURVEILLANCE THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL DNA (EDNA) MONITORING APPROACHES. HOWEVER, THE BIOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF BATS TO AGRICULTURE REMAINS UNDER-QUANTIFIED. HERE WE CATALOGUED THE DIETARY NICHE OF TWO NORTH AMERICAN BATS, LITTLE BROWN BAT (MYOTIS LUCIFUGUS) AND BIG BROWN BAT (EPTESICUS FUSCUS), THROUGH DNA METABARCODING OF GUANO COLLECTED FROM SEVEN ROOSTING SITES OVER A 26-WEEK PERIOD. WE MEASURED THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF KNOWN PEST SPECIES IN GUANO SAMPLES, COMPARED INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN DIET, AND EXAMINED SEASONAL PATTERNS IN PREY SELECTION. OVERALL, WE DETECTED 653 UNIQUE PREY SPECIES, 160 OF WHICH WERE KNOWN AGRICULTURAL PESTS OR DISEASE VECTORS. SPECIES DIVERSITY OF PREY SPECIES CONSUMED VARIED BY BAT SPECIES AND ACROSS THE SEASON, WITH BIG BROWN BATS ACCOUNTING FOR THE MAJORITY OF ARTHROPOD DIVERSITY DETECTED. HOWEVER, LITTLE BROWN BATS CONSUMED RELATIVELY MORE AQUATIC INSECTS THAN BIG BROWN BATS, SUGGESTING THAT INCREASED BAT SPECIES RICHNESS IN A LANDSCAPE CAN AMPLIFY THEIR NET PEST REGULATION SERVICE. FURTHER, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT DETECTION PROBABILITIES OF TARGET INSECT PESTS WOULD BE HIGHER IN GUANO SAMPLES THAN IN CONVENTIONAL SURVEY METHODS.

HERE, WE FOCUS ON CHANGES IN BODY SIZE AND DIET IN NEOTOMA (WOODRATS) IN RESPONSE TO THESE ECOLOGICAL PERTURBATIONS USING THE FOSSIL RECORD FROM THE EDWARDS PLATEAU (TEXAS) ACROSS THE PAST 20,000 YEARS. BODY MASS WAS ESTIMATED USING MEASUREMENTS OF FOSSIL TEETH AND DIET WAS QUANTIFIED USING STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSIS OF CARBON AND NITROGEN FROM FOSSIL BONE COLLAGEN. PRIOR TO CA. 7000 CAL YR BP, MAXIMUM MASS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO PRECIPITATION AND NEGATIVELY CORRELATED TO TEMPERATURE. INDEPENDENTLY, MASS WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED TO COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, BECOMING MORE SIMILAR TO MODERN OVER TIME. NEOTOMA DIET IN THE PLEISTOCENE WAS PRIMARILY SOURCED FROM C3 PLANTS, BUT BECAME PROGRESSIVELY MORE RELIANT ON C4 (AND POTENTIALLY CAM) PLANTS THROUGH THE HOLOCENE. DECREASING POPULATION MASS AND HIGHER C4/CAM CONSUMPTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A TRANSITION FROM A MESIC TO XERIC LANDSCAPE. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT NEOTOMA RESPONDED TO CLIMATIC VARIABILITY DURING THE TERMINAL PLEISTOCENE THROUGH CHANGES IN BODY SIZE, WHILE CHANGES IN RESOURCE AVAILABILITY DURING THE HOLOCENE LIKELY LED TO SHIFTS IN THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF DIFFERENT NEOTOMA SPECIES IN THE COMMUNITY.

ELEPHANTS, IN PARTICULAR, CAN DESTROY A YEAR'S HARVEST IN A SINGLE NIGHT, AND CAN ALSO CAUSE DAMAGE TO BUILDINGS AND OTHER FARM STRUCTURES. FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED WHETHER DAMAGE CAUSED BY WILD ELEPHANTS INCREASES SOCIAL INEQUALITIES IN FARMER COMMUNITIES. WE INTERVIEWED SETTLEMENT LEADERS AND SUBSISTENCE RICE FARMERS LIVING IN THE BUFFER ZONE OF BARDIYA NATIONAL PARK, NEPAL, TO EXAMINE (1) THE VARIATION AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH WITHIN THE FARMER COMMUNITY, (2) THE SEVERITY AND SPATIO-TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF DAMAGE INFLICTED BY ASIAN ELEPHANTS ELEPHAS MAXIMUS, AND (3) THE WILLINGNESS TO INSURE AGAINST SUCH DAMAGE. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER PARTICULAR SOCIETAL STRATA ARE DISPROPORTIONALLY AFFECTED BY NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS WITH ELEPHANTS. WE FOUND THAT FARMERS NEAR THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL AND WILDERNESS AREAS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY POORER AND HAD SMALLER LANDHOLDINGS THAN THOSE FURTHER INTO THE CULTIVATED LANDS. CONCOMITANTLY, DAMAGE TO CROPS AND HOUSES WAS MORE FREQUENT NEARER THE WILDERNESS-AGRICULTURE BOUNDARY THAN FURTHER AWAY FROM IT. HENCE, IN THE BUFFER ZONE OF BARDIYA NATIONAL PARK, FARMERS NEAR THE WILDERNESS-CULTIVATION BOUNDARY, WITH SMALL LANDHOLDINGS, HAD A RELATIVELY HIGHER COST OF ELEPHANT DAMAGE, YET WERE LESS WILLING TO PAY FOR AN INSURANCE SCHEME. WE INFER THAT IN AREAS WHERE BOTH SOCIAL INEQUALITY AND DAMAGE CAUSED BY WILDLIFE ARE SPATIALLY STRUCTURED, CONSERVATION SUCCESS MAY CAUSE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY FOR THE POORER CLASS.

SELECTED SITES ENCOMPASSED VARIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ALONG A TRANSFORMATION GRADIENT, FROM NATURAL PROTECTED AREAS TO LANDSCAPED PARKS.

WE USED MULTI-MODEL INFERENCE TO ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP OF GREEN SPACE AREA, SHAPE, ISOLATION, TREE RICHNESS, HABITAT DIVERSITY, AND VEGETATION COVER WITH SPECIES RICHNESS, FAITH’S PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY, AND FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS. WE CALCULATED STANDARDIZED EFFECT SIZES FROM NULL MODELS TO ASSESS PHYLOGENETIC AND FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE. WE REGISTERED 91 SPECIES BELONGING TO 28 FAMILIES ACROSS ALL SITES AND SEASONS. THE NUMBER OF DETECTED SPECIES WAS LARGEST IN WINTER AND DECREASED TOWARD THE DRY BREEDING SEASON, AND THEN TOWARD THE WET BREEDING SEASON. WE FOUND A MODERATE TO STRONG POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP OF SPECIES RICHNESS WITH PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY AND FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS. OVERALL, PHYLOGENETIC AND FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE OF BIRD COMMUNITIES IN GREEN SPACES WAS NEITHER CLUSTERED NOR OVER-DISPERSED. HOWEVER, FEW CASES OF FUNCTIONAL CLUSTERING, PHYLOGENETIC CLUSTERING, OR BOTH WERE OBSERVED, AND THEY CORRESPONDED TO NATURAL PROTECTED AREAS. RESULTS SHOWED A PREDOMINANT ROLE OF GREEN SPACE AREA IN DETERMINING COMMUNITY DIVERSITY AND PHYLOGENETIC STRUCTURE WHILE IT DID NOT INFLUENCE FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE. CONTRARY TO OUR PREDICTIONS, HABITAT DIVERSITY HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON SPECIES RICHNESS AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY AND THIS EFFECT WAS DETECTED ONLY DURING THE WET BREEDING SEASON, WHEREAS ISOLATION SHOWED A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH PHYLOGENETIC AND FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE, DURING THE WET BREEDING SEASON AND WINTER, RESPECTIVELY.

RES.,1,"CONTEXT: INVASIVE PREDATORS ARE MAJOR DRIVERS OF GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY LOSS. RED FOXES (VULPES VULPES) AND FERAL CATS (FELIS CATUS) HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE AND EXTINCTION OF MANY NATIVE SPECIES IN AUSTRALIA. THE DEPLOYMENT OF POISON BAITS TO CONTROL FOX POPULATIONS IS A WIDESPREAD CONSERVATION TOOL, BUT THE EFFECTS OF BAITING INTENSITY, RAINFALL AND PREY ABUNDANCE ON BAITING EFFECTIVENESS REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. AIMS: WE AIMED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT INFLUENCES THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FOX BAITING INTENSITY, RED FOX ACTIVITY AND FERAL CAT ACTIVITY, TO PROVIDE INFERENCES ABOUT WHAT MIGHT AFFECT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FOX BAITING IN REDUCING FOX ACTIVITY. METHODS: WE USED GENERALISED LINEAR MODELS TO ASSESS HOW FOX AND CAT ACTIVITY CHANGES IN RELATION TO FOX BAITING INTENSITY, RAINFALL, NATIVE PREY AVAILABILITY AND DISTANCE TO AGRICULTURAL LAND OVER A 6-YEAR PERIOD (2006-13) IN THE FOREST ECOSYSTEMS OF THE UPPER WARREN REGION OF SOUTH-WESTERN AUSTRALIA. KEY RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT FOX ACTIVITY WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH RAINFALL IN THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS AND POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PREY ABUNDANCE AND FOX BAITING INTENSITY. WE ALSO FOUND AN INTERACTION BETWEEN FOX BAITING AND PREY ABUNDANCE, WITH FOX ACTIVITY INCREASING WITH PREY ACTIVITY IN AREAS OF LOW AND MODERATE BAITING INTENSITY, BUT REMAINING CONSTANT IN AREAS OF HIGH BAITING INTENSITY. FERAL CAT ACTIVITY WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PREY ABUNDANCE AND FOX BAITING INTENSITY. WE FOUND NO CLEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOX AND CAT ACTIVITY. CONCLUSIONS: THE DRIVERS OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FOX BAITING AND FOX ACTIVITY ARE UNCLEAR BECAUSE INTENSE FOX BAITING WAS TARGETED AT AREAS OF KNOWN HIGH FOX ABUNDANCE. HOWEVER, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT INTENSE FOX BAITING MAY BE EFFECTIVE AT DECOUPLING THE POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FOX ACTIVITY AND PREY ABUNDANCE. OUR RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FOX BAITING INTENSITY AND FERAL CAT ACTIVITY, THUS SUPPORTING THE CASE FOR INTEGRATED FOX AND CAT MANAGEMENT. IMPLICATIONS: WE CAUTION INTERPRETATION OF OUR RESULTS, BUT NOTE THAT MANAGEMENT OF INVASIVE PREDATORS COULD BE IMPROVED BY ADJUSTING THE INTENSITY OF MANAGEMENT IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND LOCAL CONTEXT (E.G. STRATEGICALLY CONDUCTING INTENSE PREDATOR MANAGEMENT WHERE PREY ABUNDANCE IS HIGHEST).

RES.,1,"CONTEXT: HABITAT LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION ARE KEY DRIVERS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS WORLDWIDE, YET THE INFLUENCE OF LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE ON SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS IS UNKNOWN. GLOBALLY, REPTILES ARE THOUGHT TO BE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION DUE TO THEIR LIMITED CAPACITY FOR DISPERSAL AND RELIANCE ON NATIVE VEGETATION. NEW KNOWLEDGE OF HOW LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE INFLUENCES SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS IS NEEDED TO INFORM CONSERVATION STRATEGIES. AIMS: OUR PRINCIPAL AIM WAS TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE ON THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF 40 TERRESTRIAL REPTILE SPECIES IN VICTORIA, SOUTHEAST AUSTRALIA. METHODS: WE OBTAINED SPECIES OCCURRENCE RECORDS FROM THE VICTORIAN BIODIVERSITY ATLAS, AND USED MAXENT TO MODEL THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF REPTILE SPECIES WITHIN VICTORIA USING BIOPHYSICAL AND LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE VARIABLES. A MOVING WINDOW ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED TO A LAND COVER MAP TO DERIVE FIVE LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE METRICS; TWO METRICS REPRESENTED LANDSCAPE COVER AND THREE REPRESENTED LANDSCAPE CONFIGURATION. KEY RESULTS: CLIMATE VARIABLES WERE GENERALLY FOUND TO BE THE STRONGEST DRIVERS OF SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS, ALTHOUGH 80% OF REPTILE SPECIES WERE ALSO INFLUENCED BY LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE (PERMUTATION IMPORTANCE ≥5%). OF THE FIVE LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE VARIABLES, EXTENT OF NATIVE VEGETATION HAD THE GREATEST INFLUENCE (30 OF 40 SPECIES), FOLLOWED BY HABITAT SHAPE. FOR LERISTA BOUGAINVILLII AND TILIQUA RUGOSA, NATIVE VEGETATION COVER HAD A GREATER INFLUENCE ON THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS THAN CLIMATE VARIABLES. MOST SPECIES RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO NATIVE VEGETATION EXTENT, WHEREAS RESPONSES TO OTHER LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE VARIABLES WERE VARIED. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH MOST STUDIES OF REPTILE DISTRIBUTIONS ONLY USE BIOPHYSICAL VARIABLES IN MODELLING, OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AT THE SCALE OF OUR STUDY AREA, REPTILE SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS WERE ALSO INFLUENCED BY LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE; EXTENT OF NATIVE VEGETATION WAS AN IMPORTANT PREDICTOR FOR MOST SPECIES. INTEGRATING LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE IN MODELLING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS.

HEREIN, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER ABIOTIC FACTORS ARE RELATED TO CHANGES IN FRUIT AVAILABILITY THAT CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN FEEDING BEHAVIOR AND, CONSEQUENTLY, IN ENDOPARASITE LOAD AND GENERAL HEALTH STATUS IN TWO GROUPS OF GOLDEN-HEADED LION TAMARINS (LEONTOPITHECUS CHRYSOMELAS) LIVING IN DEGRADED FRAGMENTS OF ATLANTIC FOREST IN SOUTHERN BAHIA, BRAZIL. WE DETECTED THAT THERE WAS A HIGH VARIATION IN AVAILABILITY OF RIPE FRUITS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WITH LOWER AVAILABILITY OCCURRING AT THE END OF SPRING AND BEGINNING OF SUMMER. DESPITE THIS, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN TAMARINS’ GENERAL HEALTH STATUS, BODY MASS AND BLOOD COUNTS BETWEEN SEASONS. THIS IS PROBABLY BECAUSE DURING NATIVE FRUIT SCARCITY, THE TAMARINS EAT CULTIVATED SPECIES, SUCH AS BANANA (MUSA SPP.) AND JACKFRUIT (ARTOCARPUS HETEROPHYLLUS). TEMPERATURE AND DAYLENGTH WERE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH GOLDEN-HEADED LION TAMARIN ENDOPARASITE LOADS. CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATIONS, ENDOPARASITE LOADS ARE NOT LINKED TO FRUIT SCARCITY AND CONSEQUENT CHANGES IN FEEDING BEHAVIOR. NEVERTHELESS, WE FOUND HIGHER PARASITE DIVERSITY IN THE GROUP OF GOLDEN-HEADED LION TAMARINS THAT OCCUPIED THE SMALLEST HOME RANGE. THE SMALLER THE AREA AVAILABLE, THE GREATER THE CONTACT WITH PARASITES THE ANIMAL WILL HAVE, AS THEY ARE FORCED TO TRAVEL CONSTANTLY ALONG THE SAME ROUTES IN THE FOREST, INCREASING INFECTION RISK AND RE-INFECTION RATES.

THE SUCCESS OF EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION STRATEGIES TARGETING THESE IMPORTANT POLLINATORS RELIES HEAVILY ON ACCURATE BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENTS. THE SHORTAGE OF TAXONOMIC EXPERTS AND THE ESCALATION OF THE ONGOING BIODIVERSITY CRISIS CALL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE IDENTIFICATION TOOLS TO IMPLEMENT EFFICIENT MONITORING PROGRAMS. THE VALIDATION OF SUCH TECHNIQUES IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURE THAT THEY PROVIDE RESULTS COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF TRADITIONAL MORPHOTAXONOMY. HERE WE PERFORMED TWO DOUBLE-BLIND EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE THE ACCURACY OF A PAIR OF NEW TECHNIQUES USED FOR WILD BEE IDENTIFICATION: DNA METABARCODING AND IN VIVO IDENTIFICATION IN THE FIELD. THE METHODS WERE TESTED ON SETS OF WILD BEES FROM GERMANY AND THEIR RESULTS COMPARED AGAINST EVALUATIONS DONE BY PANELS OF BEE EXPERTS USING TRADITIONAL MORPHOTAXONOMY. ON AVERAGE THE CONGRUENCY OF SPECIES IDENTIFICATION BETWEEN METABARCODING AND MORPHOTAXONOMY WAS 88.98% ACROSS SAMPLES (N = 10), WHILE IN VIVO IDENTIFICATION AND MORPHOTAXONOMY WERE 91.81% CONGRUENT (N = 7) FOR BEES CONSIDERED FEASIBLE FOR IN VIVO IDENTIFICATION IN THE FIELD. TRADITIONAL MORPHOTAXONOMY SHOWED SIMILAR CONGRUENCIES WHEN COMPARED TO ITSELF: 93.65% IN THE METABARCODING STUDY AND 92.96% IN THE IN VIVO STUDY. OVERALL, THESE RESULTS SUPPORT BOTH NEW METHODS AS VIABLE ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL MICROSCOPY-BASED ASSESSMENT, WITH NEITHER METHOD BEING ERROR-FREE. METABARCODING PROVIDES A SUITABLE OPTION TO ANALYZE LARGE NUMBERS OF SPECIMENS IN THE ABSENCE OF HIGHLY TRAINED TAXONOMIC EXPERTS, WHILE IN VIVO IDENTIFICATION IS RECOMMENDED FOR REPEATED LONG-TERM MONITORING, AND WHEN WORKING IN AREAS WHERE THE SAMPLING OF INDIVIDUALS COULD THREATEN LOCAL POPULATIONS OF ENDANGERED WILD BEE SPECIES. FURTHER RESEARCH IS STILL NEEDED TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF BOTH TECHNIQUES FOR CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT AND WILDLIFE MONITORING, AS WELL AS TO OVERCOME THEIR CURRENT LIMITATIONS AS TAXONOMIC TOOLS. © 2022 PENSOFT PUBLISHERS.

HERE WE EXPLORE THE MULTI-SCALE LANDSCAPE ASSOCIATIONS OF THE LITTLE-STUDIED STOCK DOVE WITHIN THE URBAN MATRIX OF GREATER MANCHESTER, UK, IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY ITS HABITAT REQUIREMENTS. WE BUILT A PILOT MODEL FROM HISTORICAL CITIZEN SCIENCE RECORDS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY OCCUPIED SITES WITHIN THE CITY, AND THEN SURVEYED THESE SITES FOR STOCK DOVE DURING SPRING 2019. WE COMBINED THE SURVEY RESULTS WITH CITIZEN SCIENCE RECORDS FROM THE SAME PERIOD AND DESCRIBED THE HABITAT AND LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS OF SITES OCCUPIED BY STOCK DOVE USING FOUR VARIABLES AT DIFFERENT SCALES PLUS TWELVE UNSCALED VARIABLES. WE USED A THREE-STAGE RANDOM FOREST APPROACH TO IDENTIFY A SUBSET OF THESE VARIABLES FOR INTERPRETATION AND A SUBSET FOR PREDICTION FOR THE PRESENCE OF STOCK DOVE WITHIN THESE SITES. KEY VARIABLES FOR PREDICTING STOCK DOVE PRESENCE WERE THEIR RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IN THE LANDSCAPE IMMEDIATELY BEYOND THE CORE URBAN AREA, THE GREENNESS (NDVI) OF THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND SITES, AND THE CANOPY COVER OF INDIVIDUAL TREES OVER 20 M HIGH WITHIN SITES. STOCK DOVES TENDED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HABITATS WITH MORE SURFACE WATER DURING THE NON-BREEDING SEASON THAN THE BREEDING SEASON. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF LARGE TREES WITHIN URBAN GREENSPACE FOR THIS CAVITY-NESTING SPECIES, SOFTER BOUNDARIES AROUND URBAN SITES FOR STOCK DOVES AND STOCK DOVE PRESENCE IN NEARBY AREAS.

DESPITE THE RECENT BOOM IN GENOMES FOR WILDLIFE SPECIES, IMMUNE GENES ARE POORLY ANNOTATED IN NONMODEL SPECIES OWING TO THEIR HIGH LEVEL OF POLYMORPHISM AND COMPLEX GENOMIC ORGANISATION. OUR RESEARCH OVER THE PAST DECADE AND A HALF ON TASMANIAN DEVILS AND KOALAS HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF GENOMICS AND ACCURATE IMMUNE ANNOTATIONS TO INVESTIGATE DISEASE IN WILDLIFE. GIVEN THIS, WE HAVE INCREASINGLY BEEN ASKED THE MINIMUM LEVELS OF GENOME QUALITY REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY ANNOTATE IMMUNE GENES IN ORDER TO STUDY IMMUNOGENETIC DIVERSITY. HERE WE SET OUT TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION BY MANUALLY ANNOTATING IMMUNE GENES IN 5 MARSUPIAL GENOMES AND 1 MONOTREME GENOME TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF SEQUENCING DATA TYPE, ASSEMBLY QUALITY, AND AUTOMATED ANNOTATION ON ACCURATE IMMUNE ANNOTATION. RESULTS: GENOME QUALITY IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO OUR ABILITY TO ANNOTATE COMPLEX IMMUNE GENE FAMILIES, WITH LONG READS AND SCAFFOLDING TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED TO REASSEMBLE IMMUNE GENE CLUSTERS AND ELUCIDATE EVOLUTION, ORGANISATION, AND TRUE GENE CONTENT OF THE IMMUNE REPERTOIRE. DRAFT-QUALITY GENOMES GENERATED FROM SHORT READS WITH HIC OR 10× CHROMIUM LINKED READS WERE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS. DESPITE MAMMALIAN BUSCOV5 SCORES OF UP TO 94.1% AMONGST THE 6 GENOMES, AUTOMATED ANNOTATION PIPELINES INCORRECTLY ANNOTATED UP TO 59% OF MANUALLY ANNOTATED IMMUNE GENES REGARDLESS OF ASSEMBLY QUALITY OR METHOD OF AUTOMATED ANNOTATION.

SYNTHESIZING THE SEQUENCE OF BASIC EVENTS INVOLVED IN THE EMERGENCE OF NEW HUMAN PATHOGENS IS IMPORTANT FOR GUIDING THE UNDERSTANDING, IDENTIFI CATION, AND DESCRIPTION OF KEY ASPECTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BE CHANGED TO PREVENT NEW OUTBREAKS, EPIDEMICS, AND PANDEMICS. THIS REVIEW SYNTHESIZES THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL DISTURBANCES AND INCREASED RISK OF SPILLOVER EVENTS BASED ON THE ONE HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES IN THE ENVIRONMENT (E.G., DEFORESTATION, HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, BIODIVERSITY LOSS, WILDLIFE EXPLOITATION) LEAD TO CHANGES IN ECOLOGICAL NICHES, REDUCTION OF THE DILUTION EFFECT, INCREASED CONTACT BETWEEN HUMANS AND OTHER ANIMALS, CHANGES IN THE INCIDENCE AND LOAD OF PATHOGENS IN ANIMAL POPULATIONS, AND ALTERATIONS IN THE ABIOTIC FACTORS OF LANDSCAPES. THESE PHENOMENA CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF SPILLOVER EVENTS AND, POTENTIALLY, FACILITATE NEW INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS.

PLANT SCI.,0,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: THE LACK OF BIODIVERSITY KNOWLEDGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS ARE THE TWO INEVITABLE TRUTHS AROUND US. ALGAE ARE THE MOST CRUCIAL ORGANISM IN OUR ENTIRE BIODIVERSITY. THE SEASONAL VARIATION OF ALGAL DIVERSITY CAN MONITOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES OF THE FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEM. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BECAUSE THE SEASONAL CHANGES OF ALGAL DIVERSITY IN CHIMMONY WILDLIFE SANCTUARY WERE UTTERLY UNKNOWN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE ALGAL SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AND PRESERVED FROM TEN STATIONS FOR THREE SEASONS (PRE-MONSOON, MONSOON, POST-MONSOON). THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS OF WATER LIKE TEMPERATURE, PH, TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS, TOTAL DISSOLVED OXYGEN, TOTAL ALKALINITY AND LIGHT INTENSITY OF THE SAMPLING STATIONS WERE RECORDED. RESULTS: THE STUDY REVEALED THAT THE SEASONAL VARIATION OF PHYSICOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS PROVOKED A CHANGE IN THE DIVERSITY OF ALGAE. THE CHIMMONY WILDLIFE SANCTUARY HAS ITS HIGHEST ALGAL DIVERSITY DURING PRE-MONSOON SEASON. THE CHLOROPHYCEAE ALGAE WERE DOMINANT DURING THE PRE-MONSOON SEASON, WHILE THE CYANOPHYCEAN ALGAE WERE DOMINANT DURING MONSOON SEASON. THE ANOVA (TWO-WAY) ANALYSIS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STATIONS AND THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEASONS FOR DISSOLVED OXYGEN, ALKALINITY, TEMPERATURE AND TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS. WHILE FOR PH, IT SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEASONS AND STATIONS BUT FOR LIGHT INTENSITY, IT SHOWED A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STATIONS AND SEASONS.

ONE APPROACH FOR INCREASING URBAN BIODIVERSITY IS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF “GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE”. ALTHOUGH RESEARCH HAS EXPLORED URBAN-RURAL GRADIENTS AND THE OVERALL VALUE OF URBAN GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE, FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE HABITAT VALUE FOR WILDLIFE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF URBAN GREENSPACE. HERE, WE USE A WELL-ESTABLISHED METRIC IN ECOLOGY, GIVING UP-DENSITIES (GUDS), TO COMPARE FORAGING COSTS FOR A COMMON URBAN WILDLIFE SPECIES, THE EASTERN GRAY SQUIRREL (SCIURUS CAROLINENSIS), AMONG THREE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE CATEGORIES: MUNICIPAL PARKS, COLLEGE CAMPUSES, AND RESIDENTIAL YARDS. WE FOUND THAT GUDS FOR GRAY SQUIRRELS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG LOCATION CATEGORIES AFTER CONTROLLING FOR PROXIMITY TO ROADS, BUT PROXIMITY TO ROADS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GUDS IN ALL LOCATIONS. IN AN EXPLICIT TEST, WE ALSO FOUND THAT BOTH PROXIMITY TO ROADS AND TRAFFIC VOLUME WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER GUDS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT MAXIMUM DISTANCE FROM ROADS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOR CAMPUSES AND PARKS THAN FOR RESIDENTIAL YARDS, INDICATING A GREATER PROPORTION OF THE AREA OF CAMPUSES AND PARKS IS “AWAY FROM ROADS” COMPARED TO RESIDENTIAL YARDS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT VEHICLE TRAFFIC MAY CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO AN “URBAN LANDSCAPE OF FEAR” FOR GRAY SQUIRRELS AND SUGGEST THAT CAMPUS AND PARK CONFIGURATIONS THAT REDUCE ROAD EFFECTS COULD IMPROVE HABITAT QUALITY FOR SQUIRRELS AND POSSIBLY OTHER ANIMALS. © 2022, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA, LLC, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE.",NA,NA,NA,"KAY, A.D.; BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: ADKAY@STTHOMAS.EDU",ARTICLE,10.1007/s11252-022-01288-7,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, DEB-2045382 UNIVERSITY OF ST.

THIS CAN BE COMBINED WITH OTHER ECOTOURISM ACTIVITIES TO ATTRACT TOURISTS AND CREATE AN INTEREST IN THE CONSERVATION OF FROGS WHILE HAVING FUN AT THE SAME TIME. THE AIM WAS TO DETERMINE THE ECOTOURISM POTENTIAL OF FROGS IN SOUTH AFRICA, PRIMARILY BY DISTRIBUTING QUESTIONNAIRES TO TOURISTS TO RETRIEVE INFORMATION ON WHETHER THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN FROG-RELATED ECOTOURISM ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL PARKS. FOR THIS RESEARCH, A QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH APPROACH WAS FOLLOWED, NAMELY NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING, TO WHICH CONVENIENCE SAMPLING WAS APPLIED. AN ONLINE SURVEY (QUESTIONNAIRE) WAS DESIGNED TO COLLECT THE DATA FOR THE RESEARCH. THE SURVEY OUTCOME WAS SATISFACTORY, AS POTENTIAL TOURISTS INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN FROG-RELATED ACTIVITIES. THE PROJECT OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSERVE FROGS, EDUCATE TOURISTS, AND CREATE JOB OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. IT WILL ALSO CREATE A NEW TOURISM PRODUCT FOR THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL PARKS.

ENVIRONMENTAL DNA (EDNA) METHODS HAVE IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL BIODIVERSITY SURVEY METHODS FOR MONITORING CONSERVATION AREAS. TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF EDNA METABARCODING FOR FISH BIODIVERSITY MONITORING, WE SAMPLED 19 COASTAL EELGRASS (ZOSTERA MARINA) BEDS IN CANADA, AS EELGRASS BEDS ARE KNOWN FOR HIGH BIODIVERSITY AND SIGNIFICANT CONSERVATION VALUE. AT EACH SITE, BEACH SEINES WERE USED TO SURVEY FISH AND WATER SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED CONTEMPORANEOUSLY FOR EDNA METABARCODING. IN TOTAL, BEACH SEINING CAUGHT 32 672 INDIVIDUALS ACROSS 59 FISH TAXA, AND EDNA DETECTED 129 FISH TAXA. EDNA CAPTURED SITE-LEVEL VARIATION AND DETECTED HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS AT BOTH SITE AND REGIONAL LEVELS COMPARED TO SEINING. EDNA ABUNDANCE HAD A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WITH CAPTURE ABUNDANCE.

OVER THE PAST 50 YEARS, MORE THAN 68% OF THE MAMMALS, BIRDS, AMPHIBIANS, REPTILES, AND FISH ON EARTH HAVE DISAPPEARED, PUTTING THE PLANET'S SURVIVAL AND ITS INHABITANTS—INCLUDING HUMAN BEINGS—AT RISK. FINANCIALIZATION, OR THE TRANSFORMATION OF NATURE INTO FINANCIAL ASSETS, IS INCREASINGLY PROPOSED AS A SOLUTION TO THE BIODIVERSITY CRISIS. PROPONENTS OF FINANCIALIZATION BELIEVE THAT ASSIGNING A MONETARY VALUE TO NATURE WILL INCENTIVIZE HUMAN BEINGS TO PROTECT HABITATS AND THEIR SPECIES. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A FOUR-MECHANISM MODEL OF NATURE'S FINANCIALIZATION, EXPLAINING WHY IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FINANCIALIZE NATURE. WE COLLECTED DATA THROUGH A UNIQUE TWO-STAGE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS, INCLUDING A SINGLE CASE STUDY AND ADDITIONAL INTERVIEWS WITH CONSERVATIONISTS AND CONSERVATION FINANCE SPECIALISTS. WE ANALYZED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CALCULATIVE DEVICE, THE “INDEX,” DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF CONSERVATION EFFORTS ON THE SURVIVAL OF ENDANGERED SPECIES. CONSERVATIONISTS HOPED TO USE THE INDEX TO CALCULATE THE FINANCIAL RETURN OF A CONSERVATION IMPACT BOND, A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT DESIGNED TO FINANCE CONSERVATION PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL. WE DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FINANCIALIZATION AND CONSERVATION LITERATURE AND THE ROLE OF ACCOUNTING THEREIN.

HENCE, THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS AND RISKS OF TWO READILY AVAILABLE PET TRADE SPECIES: GOLDFISH, CARASSIUS AURATUS, A SPECIES WITH NON-NATIVE POPULATIONS WORLDWIDE; AND WHITE CLOUD MOUNTAIN MINNOW, TANICHTHYS ALBONUBES, A SPECIES WITH A LIMITED INVASION HISTORY TO DATE. FIRST, WE COMPARED THE PER CAPITA FEEDING RATES OF THESE NON-NATIVE SPECIES WITH TWO EUROPEAN TROPHICALLY ANALOGOUS NATIVES – THE STONE LOACH, BARBATULA BARBATULA, AND THE COMMON MINNOW, PHOXINUS PHOXINUS – USING THE COMPARATIVE FUNCTIONAL RESPONSE METHOD. SECOND, WE USED FORAGING EXPERIMENTS IN CONSPECIFIC PAIRS TO DETERMINE SYNERGISTIC, NEUTRAL OR ANTAGONISTIC INTRASPECIFIC INTERACTIONS. THIRD, WE PERFORMED NOVEL OBJECT EXPERIMENTS USING THE TWO PET TRADE SPECIES TO ASSESS BOLDNESS, A KNOWN “DISPERSAL ENHANCING TRAIT”. GOLDFISH HAD THE HIGHEST MAXIMUM FEEDING RATES OF THE FOUR SPECIES, WHILE WHITE CLOUD MOUNTAIN MINNOWS HAD THE LOWEST. NEUTRAL INTERACTIONS WERE OBSERVED FOR ALL FOUR SPECIES IN THE PAIRED FORAGING EXPERIMENTS, WITH GOLDFISH HAVING THE HIGHEST CONSUMPTION AND WHITE CLOUD MOUNTAIN MINNOWS HAVING THE LOWEST. GOLDFISH DEMONSTRATED GREATER BOLDNESS, BEING MORE ACTIVE DURING THE EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS AND MORE LIKELY TO APPROACH A NOVEL OBJECT THAN WHITE CLOUD MOUNTAIN MINNOWS. FURTHER, COMBINING MAXIMUM FEEDING RATES, BOLDNESS AND SPECIES AVAILABILITIES FROM OUR SURVEY OF PET SHOPS, WE ASSESSED THE RELATIVE INVASION RISKS (RIR) OF THE TWO NON-NATIVES. THIS HIGHLIGHTED GOLDFISH AS THE HIGHER RISK AND MOST WORTHY OF MANAGEMENT PRIORITISATION, MIRRORING ITS MORE EXTENSIVE INVASION HISTORY.

IN THE LABORATORY, FECES WERE WASHED, SEINED AND DRIED IN AN OVEN AT 70°C FOR 24 H; LATER, THE CONSUMED COMPONENTS WERE SEPARATED AND IDENTIFIED. A TOTAL OF 101 FECES WERE COLLECTED IN THE AYUQUILA-ARMERÍA RIVER, AND 93 IN THE MARABASCO RIVER. AN 80% OF THE FOOD IS MADE UP OF FISH AND CRUSTACEANS, WHILE THE REMAINING 20% INCLUDES INSECTS, MAMMALS, REPTILES, AMPHIBIANS, BIRDS, MOLLUSKS AND PLANT MATTER. SIXTEEN SPECIES OF FISH CONSUMED WERE IDENTIFIED, OF WHICH FIVE ARE EXOTIC. THE NEOTROPICAL OTTER PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNISTIC AND GENERALIST DIET, BASED MAINLY ON THE CONSUMPTION OF FISH AND CRUSTACEANS. © 2022 UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL AUTONOMA DE MEXICO.

WHEN PAYMENTS CEASE, THE BEHAVIORS THEY MOTIVATE CAN CHANGE. PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON CONSERVATION-BASED PAYMENTS RECOGNIZES THE IMPERMANENCE OF CONSERVATION SUCCESS, BUT IT DOES NOT CONSIDER THE LEGACY OF PAYMENTS THAT FAILED TO EFFECT CHANGE. THIS RESEARCH ASSESSES IMPERMANENCE AND FAILURE BY INVESTIGATING THE LEGACY OF VILLAGE-LEVEL CONSERVATION PAYMENTS MADE THROUGH ONE OF THE LARGEST INTEGRATED CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN INDONESIA. THE KERINCI-SEBLAT INTEGRATED CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AIMED TO CONSERVE FOREST AREA AND PROMOTE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH VOLUNTARY CONSERVATION AGREEMENTS (VCAS) THAT PROVIDED PAYMENTS FOR PRO-CONSERVATION PLEDGES AND ACTIVITIES FROM 2000 THROUGH 2003. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND PREVIOUS RESEARCH FIND THAT PAYMENTS FAILED TO INCENTIVIZE ADDITIONAL FOREST CONSERVATION, PRODUCING NONSIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN FOREST-COVER CHANGE DURING THE PROJECT PERIOD. TO EXAMINE THE LEGACY OF THESE PAYMENTS IN THE POST-PROJECT PERIOD, THIS RESEARCH USES MATCHED DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES AND TRIPLE DIFFERENCES MODELS TO ANALYZE FOREST COVER CHANGE IN VILLAGES (N = 263) FROM 2000 THROUGH 2016 AS WELL AS MATCHED BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS TO ASSESS ENDURING DIFFERENCES IN HOUSEHOLD (N = 1303) LIVELIHOOD STRATEGIES WITHIN VCA VILLAGES IN 2016. THE ANALYSIS FINDS THAT VCA VILLAGES CONTAINED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FOREST LOSS THAN THE MOST SIMILAR NON-VCA VILLAGES OUTSIDE THE NATIONAL PARK, AND GREATER PAYMENTS PREDICT INCREASED FOREST LOSS IN THE POST-PROJECT PERIOD. IN ADDITION, FARMING HIGH-VALUE TREE CROPS AND CULTIVATING PRIVATE LAND WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTES FOR MODELING VCA AFFILIATION AMONG RANDOMLY SELECTED HOUSEHOLDS.

CHANGES IN LAND USE CAN ALTER THE ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF BIRDS OF PREY BY AFFECTING HABITAT AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF HABITAT ALTERATION ON THE DEMOGRAPHY OF A DECLINING EASTERN IMPERIAL EAGLE (AQUILA HELIACA), MAKING ASSUMPTIONS FOR FUTURE POPULATION TRAJECTORIES. WE USED THE GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS WITH POISSON DISTRIBUTION AND LOG LINK FUNCTION, SEARCHING A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEMOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS AND THE LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF FRAGMENTATION. IN OUR STUDY AREA, HABITAT CHANGE AFFECTED DRAMATICALLY PERMANENT GRASSLANDS, SHRINKING THEIR AVAILABILITY. AS WE EXPECTED, THE SHARE OF GRASSLANDS IN EAGLES’ TERRITORIES SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED OCCUPANCY RATE, BUT NOT PRODUCTIVITY AND BREEDING FREQUENCY. WE FOUND THAT OCCUPANCY RATE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, WHILE PRODUCTIVITY AND BREEDING FREQUENCY SHOWED NO TREND. MODELING THE EFFECT OF HABITAT ALTERATION ON EASTERN IMPERIAL EAGLE DEMOGRAPHY, WE FOUND OUT THAT TERRITORY QUALITY WAS A MORE POWERFUL FACTOR DRIVING THE RESPONSE OF A TOP PREDATOR TO THE ALTERATION OF FAVORITE FORAGING HABITATS. ONLY THE HABITAT QUALITY IN SOURCE TERRITORIES HAD A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON EAGLE PRODUCTIVITY. WE FOUND THAT SIMPLE RULES TO PREDICT ADVERSE AGRICULTURAL IMPACT ON TERRITORY ABANDONMENT OR BREEDING PRODUCTIVITY OF A TOP PREDATOR WERE NOT RELIABLE.

WE FOUND THAT LAND-USE PATTERNS OF OUR STUDY AREA CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE COUNTRY'S ACCESSION TO THE EU. SPECTACULAR LOSS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF GRASSLANDS, ESPECIALLY PERMANENT PASTURES, WAS RECORDED IN THE FIRST PROGRAMMING PERIOD FOR BULGARIA (2007?2013), FOLLOWING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CAP. THIS OCCURRED THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE COUNTRY (DOBREV ET AL., 2014), PARTICULARLY AFFECTING THE SAKAR MNT., THE ADJACENT DERVENT HEIGHTS, AND THE WESTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE STRANDZHA MNT., WHERE MOST OF THE EIE POPULATION IN BULGARIA IS CONCENTRATED AND WHERE MOST OF THE AREAS ARE SOURCE TERRITORIES (DEMERDZHIEV ET AL., 2014B). THIS RESULTED IN A CHANGE IN THE LAND-USE PATTERN EXPRESSED AS WIDESPREAD CONVERSION OF GRASSLANDS INTO CROPLAND AND ESTABLISHMENT OF LARGE ARABLE MONOCULTURE FIELDS MAINLY SOWN WITH CEREALS, SUNFLOWER, AND OIL RAPE. HENCE, IN THE 1990S, A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE ARABLE LAND IN THE COUNTRY WAS ABANDONED. THEREFORE, BY 2007 (THE YEAR OF BULGARIA'S ACCESSION TO THE EU), ONLY 58.4% OF THE ARABLE LAND IN BULGARIA WAS CULTIVATED (AGROSTATISTICS, 2011). AFTER BULGARIA'S ACCESSION TO THE EU AND THE RELATED PRE-ACCESSION FUNDING, A GRADUAL PROCESS OF PARTIAL RESTORATION OF LIVESTOCK BREEDING BEGAN IN THE SEMI-MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS. THUS, FORMERLY ARABLE LANDS THAT WERE SUBSEQUENTLY ABANDONED WERE CONVERTED INTO SEMI-NATURAL PERMANENT GRASSLANDS. HOWEVER, THE ACCESSION TO THE EU AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CAP AND THE SINGLE AREA PAYMENT SCHEME (SAPS) IN PARTICULAR, LED TO WIDESPREAD PLOWING OF THESE SEMI-NATURAL PERMANENT GRASSLANDS AND THEIR CONVERSION BACK TO ARABLE AREAS (DOBREV ET AL., 2014).MANY VOLUNTEERS ASSISTED WITH THE MONITORING AND CONSERVATION EFFORTS, AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF VERA DYULGERSKA, SVETOSLAV SPASOV, EDITA DIFOVA, IVAYLO ANGELOV, NIKOLAI TERZIEV, TZENO PETROV, PETAR IANKOV, VLADIMIR TRIFONOV, NEDKO NEDYALKOV, ATANAS DEMERDZHIEV, KRASIMIRA DEMERDZHIEVA, GEORGI GEORGIEV, DIMITAR PLACHIYSKY, GEORGI GERDZHIKOV, VLADIMIR DOBREV, VANYO ANGELOV, ALEXANDER GEORGIEV, VASILENA GEORGIEVA.

HERE, WE ESTIMATE NET FERTILIZATION RATES OF DOGS IN PERI-URBAN ECOSYSTEMS, WITH A FOCUS ON NITROGEN (N) AND PHOSPHORUS (P) BECAUSE OF THEIR EVIDENT EFFECTS ON PLANT BIODIVERSITY. WE USED 487 DIRECT-COUNT CENSUSES OVER 1.5 YEARS TO COLLECT ACCURATE DOG ABUNDANCE DATA PER HECTARE PER YEAR IN FOUR SITES IN PERI-URBAN FORESTS AND NATURE RESERVES IN BELGIUM. BASED ON ESTIMATED DOG DENSITIES AND A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH OF NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS IN URINE AND FAECES, WE CALCULATE N AND P FERTILIZATION RATES FROM URINE AND FAECES DEPOSITS, ALSO PROPAGATING UNCERTAINTY AND VARIABILITY IN THESE ESTIMATES. WE FIND THAT CANINE N AND P FERTILIZATION RATES ON AVERAGE AMOUNT TO 11 KG N (MORE OR LESS EQUALLY FROM URINE AND FAECES) AND 5 KG P (PREDOMINANTLY FROM FAECES) PER HECTARE PER YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. THESE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS ARE SUBSTANTIAL WHEN COMPARED TO ATMOSPHERIC INPUTS OF N AND EXTRACTABLE AMOUNTS VIA TRADITIONAL NATURE MANAGEMENT (E.G. MOWING AND HAY REMOVAL).

SOC.,1,"PLANNING AND POLICY ARE BEST DONE THROUGH INTEGRATED APPROACHES THAT HOLISTICALLY ADDRESS MULTIPLE SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES. CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS ARE TWO OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FACING OUR PLANET. ACCORDINGLY, ADVANCEMENTS IN INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING AND POLICY REQUIRE A MEANS FOR EXAMINING HOW CERTAIN STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS MAY ALIGN OR CONFLICT WITH THESE SUSTAINABILITY IMPERATIVES. HERE, WE ENHANCE THE KNOWLEDGE OF INTEGRATED APPROACHES FOR ADDRESSING SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES BY DEVELOPING AND APPLYING A FRAMEWORK FOR EXAMINING DIFFERENT PLANNING AND POLICY AREAS IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE ACTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. AS A CASE STUDY, WE USED WILDLIFE CROSSING PLANNING AND LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY POLICY IN CANADA, WHICH IS CURRENTLY PIECEMEAL, FRAGMENTED, AND COULD BENEFIT FROM AN INTEGRATED APPROACH. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN TWO STAGES. FIRST, WE DEVELOPED AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR EXAMINING ISSUES IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE ACTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION CO-BENEFITS AND TRADE-OFFS. THEN, WE APPLIED THE FRAMEWORK TO WILDLIFE CROSSING AND LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY ISSUES TO ELUCIDATE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR INTEGRATED PLANNING AND POLICY. WE USED A LITERATURE REVIEW TO DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED CLIMATE-BIODIVERSITY FRAMEWORK (ICBF). ICBF WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPLIED TO WILDLIFE CROSSING AND LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY PLANNING AND POLICIES IN CANADA. ICBF MAPS RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CLIMATE ACTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION CO-BENEFITS AND TRADE-OFFS AND IS ORGANIZED INTO SIX THEMES: GREEN SPACE, TRANSPORTATION, GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE, FOOD AND AGRICULTURE, ENERGY, AND LAND MANAGEMENT. APPLYING ICBF TO PARTICIPANT INTERVIEW DATA PRODUCED INSIGHTS INTO OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR INTEGRATED APPROACHES TO WILDLIFE CROSSING AND LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY BY ELUCIDATING POTENTIAL CO-BENEFITS AND TRADE-OFFS SUCH AS ALIGNMENTS BETWEEN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND AQUATIC CROSSINGS (I.E., CO-BENEFITS) AND POTENTIAL ISSUES RELATED TO ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND HABITAT FRAGMENTATION (I.E., TRADE-OFFS). ICBF HAS APPLICATION BEYOND WILDLIFE CROSSINGS, AND ITS CONTINUAL USE AND REFINEMENT WILL RESULT IN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT INTEGRATED APPROACHES AND TRANSITION TOWARD SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PATHS. © 2022 BY THE AUTHOR(S).

THEY NOW HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MASSIVELY INCREASE THE VOLUME AND SPATIOTEMPORAL COVERAGE OF IAS OCCURRENCE DATA ACCRUED IN CENTRALISED DATABASES. WHILE MORE REPORTING APPS ARE DEVELOPED EACH YEAR, INNOVATION ACROSS DIVERSE FUNCTIONALITIES AND DATA MANAGEMENT IN THIS FIELD ARE OCCURRING SEPARATELY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY AMONGST NUMEROUS RESEARCH GROUPS WITH LITTLE ATTENTION TO TRENDS, PRIORITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT. THIS CREATES THE RISK OF DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPLEMENTING NEW AND EXISTING FUNCTIONALITIES THAT WOULD DIRECTLY BENEFIT IAS RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT. USING A LITERATURE SEARCH OF EARLY DETECTION AND RAPID RESPONSE IMPLEMENTATION, SMARTPHONE APP DEVELOPMENT AND INVASIVE SPECIES REPORTING APPS, WE DEVELOPED A RUBRIC FOR QUANTITATIVELY ASSESSING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IAS REPORTING APPS AND APPLIED THIS RUBRIC TO 41 FREE, ENGLISH-LANGUAGE IAS REPORTING APPS, AVAILABLE VIA MAJOR MOBILE APP STORES IN NORTH AMERICA. THE FIVE HIGHEST PERFORMING APPS ACHIEVED SCORES OF 61.90% TO 66.35% RELATIVE TO A HYPOTHETICAL MAXIMUM SCORE, INDICATING THAT MANY APP FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITIES, ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE USEFUL FOR IAS REPORTING IN LITERATURE, ARE NOT PRESENT IN SAMPLED APPS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT CURRENT IAS REPORTING APPS DO NOT MAKE USE OF ALL AVAILABLE AND KNOWN FUNCTIONALITIES THAT COULD MAXIMISE THEIR EFFICACY. MAJOR IMPLEMENTATION GAPS, HIGHLIGHTED BY THIS RUBRIC ANALYSIS, INCLUDED LIMITED IMPLEMENTATION IN USER ENGAGEMENT (PARTICULARLY GAMIFICATION ELEMENTS AND SOCIAL MEDIA COMPATIBILITY), ANCILLARY INFORMATION ON SEARCH EFFORT, DETECTION METHOD, THE ABILITY TO REPORT ABSENCES AND LOCAL HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS. THE GREATEST ADVANCEMENT IN IAS EARLY DETECTION WOULD LIKELY RESULT FROM APP GAMIFICATION. THIS WOULD MAKE IAS REPORTING MORE ENGAGING FOR A GROWING COMMUNITY OF NON-PROFESSIONAL CONTRIBUTORS AND ENCOURAGE FREQUENT AND PROLONGED PARTICIPATION. WE DISCUSS THESE IMPLEMENTATION GAPS IN RELATION TO THE INCREASINGLY URGENT NEED FOR EARLY DETECTION AND RAPID RESPONSE FRAMEWORKS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND FUTURE INNOVATIONS IN IAS REPORTING APP DEVELOPMENT TO HELP SLOW THE SPREAD OF IAS AND CURB THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND BIODIVERSITY EXTINCTION CRISES. WE ALSO SUGGEST THAT FURTHER FUNDING AND INVESTMENT IN THIS AND OTHER IMPLEMENTATION GAPS COULD GREATLY INCREASE THE EFFICACY OF CURRENT IAS REPORTING APPS AND INCREASE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO ADDRESSING THE CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGICAL INVASION THREAT © COPYRIGHT LEIF HOWARD ET AL.

ABOUT 50% OF THE CURRENTLY RECOGNISED CHELONIAN SPECIES ARE CONSIDERED THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION ACCORDING TO THE IUCN RED LIST. ASIA IS AN EPICENTRE FOR THE TURTLE AND TORTOISE EXTINCTION CRISIS, CONTAINING THE HIGHEST DIVERSITY OF THREATENED SPECIES. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS (SDMS) TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING PROTECTED AREAS ACROSS SOUTHEAST AND SOUTH ASIA FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THREE LARGE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED FRESHWATER TURTLES (BATAGUR BORNEOENSIS, B. AFFINIS, AND PELOCHELYS CANTORII). WE DERIVED THE MODELS BASED ON SELECTED BIOCLIMATIC VARIABLES AT THE SITES OF KNOWN SPECIES RECORDS. OUR SDMS SHOWED THAT INDONESIA IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IN PRIORITISING CONSERVATION FOR THESE THREE SPECIES, CONTAINING THE LARGEST AREAS OF SUITABLE HABITAT WITHIN PROTECTED AREAS. HOWEVER, WHEN CONSIDERING WATER SURFACE COVERAGE, THAILAND HAS THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF SUITABLE AREAS UNDER PROTECTION. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE PRESENT COVER OF PROTECTED NETWORK RESERVES SEEMS INADEQUATE IN TERMS OF SIZE AND SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO SUSTAIN POPULATIONS OF THE THREE TARGET SPECIES. THEREFORE, WE IDENTIFIED PRIORITY AREAS AND RESERVES CRITICAL FOR FURTHER FIELD SURVEYS TO GUIDE THE POTENTIAL DISCOVERY OF NOVEL POPULATIONS. TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WE ALSO PROJECTED POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTIONS ONTO ENSEMBLES OF FOUR IPCC STORY LINES. AS A RESULT, WE FOUND LARGER EXTRALIMITAL AREAS OF SUITABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL THREE SPECIES, PARTICULARLY NORTHWARDS AND INLAND. HOWEVER, HIGH DEGREES OF UNCERTAINTY IN CLIMATE CONDITIONS INDICATE FEW RESERVES MAY PROVIDE LONG TERM PROTECTION.

THIS PRESSURE IS DUE, INTER ALIA, TO DIFFERENT LAND USES SUCH AS PASTORALISM. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE PRESENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ANALYSES THE STATE OF RESEARCH ON THE NEXUS BETWEEN PASTORALISM AND BIODIVERSITY IN WEST AFRICA. IN PARTICULAR, IT EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PASTORALISM (CF. AGRO-PASTORALISM, SYLVO-PASTORALISM, AGRO-SYLVO-PASTORALISM), ON THE ONE HAND, AND PLANT DIVERSITY, ANIMAL DIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM DIVERSITY, ON THE OTHER HAND. THE PAPER ALSO ANALYSES THE BIBLIOMETRICS OF THE RESEARCH FIELD. A SEARCH PERFORMED IN MARCH 2021 ON THE WEB OF SCIENCE YIELDED 205 DOCUMENTS AND 73 OF THEM WERE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THE BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS SUGGESTS AN INCREASING INTEREST IN THE RESEARCH FIELD, ESPECIALLY IN BURKINA FASO AND BENIN, BUT ALSO THE WEAKNESS OF THE DOMESTIC RESEARCH SYSTEM AS A LARGE SHARE OF THE SELECTED DOCUMENTS IS AUTHORED BY RESEARCHERS BASED OUTSIDE WEST AFRICA. IN GENERAL, THE SCHOLARLY LITERATURE SHOWS A NEGATIVE IMPACT OF PASTORALISM ON PLANT DIVERSITY (CF. RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE, COMPOSITION) AND ANIMAL DIVERSITY (CF. WILD HERBIVOROUS MAMMALS, PREDATORS, BIRDS, INSECTS) IN WEST AFRICA. HOWEVER, THE LITERATURE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE EFFECTS OF PASTORALISM ARE RATHER MIXED. THEY ARE CONTEXT-SPECIFIC AND DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS SUCH AS GRAZING INTENSITY AND LIVESTOCK SPECIES. THE EFFECTS ON PLANT DIVERSITY DIFFER BETWEEN WOODY (TREES AND SHRUBS) AND HERBACEOUS SPECIES. THERE IS A GENERAL TREND TOWARDS THE EROSION OF INDIGENOUS LIVESTOCK GENETIC DIVERSITY DUE TO UNCONTROLLED MATING AND CROSS-BREEDING. THE IMPACTS OF PASTORALISM ON ECOSYSTEM DIVERSITY ARE MAINLY DUE TO CHANGES IN LAND USE AND HABITAT FRAGMENTATION. FURTHER MULTI-COUNTRY, COMPARATIVE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO BETTER QUALIFY THE INTERACTIONS, COMPLEMENTARITIES AND POSSIBLE CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PASTORALISM-RELATED LAND USES AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN WEST AFRICA. © 2022 THE AUTHOR(S), LICENSEE AIMS PRESS.

TO GAIN INSIGHTS INTO THE STATUS OF NORTHERN GERMANY’S OTTER POPULATION, 92 OTTERS FOUND DEAD IN SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN BETWEEN 2015−2020 WERE COLLECTED AND UNDERWENT DETAILED DISSECTION WITH THE AIM TO ESTABLISH A MONITORING PROGRAM FOR THIS POPULATION. EXAMINATIONS FOLLOWED A PROTOCOL ESPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR OTTERS, INCLUDING VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL DATA ASSESSMENTS AND EXTENDED SAMPLING. THE FINDING SITES SHOWED A CLEAR CONCENTRATION IN THE CONTINENTAL REGION. SEASONAL CONCENTRATION DIFFERED AMONG THE YEARS, YET PEAKS WERE SEEN FROM FALL TO WINTER. OVERALL, MORE MALES THAN FEMALES WERE FOUND, ALTHOUGH THIS DIFFERED AMONG THE YEARS. THE MAJORITY OF OTTERS THAT COULD BE AGED WERE BETWEEN 1–3 YEARS. PLACENTAL SCARS AND PREGNANCY WERE RECORDED IN ONLY FEW FEMALES. NUTRITIONAL STATUS WAS GOOD IN MOST CASES. INFECTIOUS DISEASES FOUND INCLUDED VAGOCOCCUS LUTRAE, TOXOPLASMA GONDII, AND EMMONSIA SPP. A MAJOR CAUSE OF DEATH WAS ROADKILL. KNOWN SAMPLE BIAS IN STUDIES FOCUSING ON ROADKILL WAS CONSIDERED IN THE FINDING INTERPRETATION.

CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH CHANGES DEPEND ON COMPLEX CAUSAL CHAINS WHICH CALL FOR INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES WHOSE EFFICIENCY COULD BENEFIT FROM ECOSYSTEM DYNAMIC MODELING. HOWEVER, ECOSYSTEM MODELS OFTEN REQUIRE LOTS OF QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FOR ESTIMATING PARAMETERS, WHICH IS OFTEN UNAVAILABLE. ALTERNATIVELY, QUALITATIVE MODELING FRAMEWORKS HAVE PROVED USEFUL FOR EXPLAINING ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES TO PER-TURBATIONS, WHILE ONLY REQUIRING QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS AND EVENTS AND PROVIDING MORE GENERAL PREDICTIONS DUE TO THEIR VALIDITY FOR WIDE RANGES OF PARAMETER VALUES. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE THE ECOLOGICAL DISCRETE-EVENT NETWORK (EDEN), AN INNOVATIVE QUALITATIVE DYNAMIC MODELING FRAMEWORK BASED ON “IF-THEN” RULES GENERATING NON-DETERMINISTIC DYNAMICS.

UNDERSTANDING THIS DISTRIBUTION OF OPINION IS KEY TO FINDING CONSERVATION SOLUTIONS. WE EXAMINE HOW STAKEHOLDERS WITH WIDELY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS VARY IN THEIR JUDGMENTS OF RANGELAND DEGRADATION IN MONGOLIA'S GOBI DESERT, WHERE GRAZING INTENSITY IS A CONTESTED ISSUE. WE GATHERED THE JUDGMENTS OF 92 STAKEHOLDERS FROM A HIGHLY DIVERSE GROUP INCLUDING: (I) NOMADIC PASTORALISTS (HERDERS), (II) EXPERTS IN BOTANY, (III) EXPERTS IN WILDLIFE ECOLOGY, AND (IV) CONSERVATION POLICY PRACTITIONERS. THESE STAKEHOLDERS CONSIDERED DEGRADATION IN FIVE ECOSYSTEMS INCLUDING DESERT SHRUBLANDS, STEPPE, AND SIBERIAN ELM RIPARIAN WOODLANDS, USING WRITTEN SITE DESCRIPTIONS IN A WORKSHOP CONTEXT. EACH STAKEHOLDER CONSIDERED DEGRADATION USING TWO CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS: THE NOTION OF “ECOSYSTEM COLLAPSE” DESCRIBED BY THE IUCN RED LIST OF ECOSYSTEMS AND THE CONCEPT OF ECOLOGICAL CONDITION. WE USED GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODELS (GAMS) TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VEGETATION ATTRIBUTES AND STAKEHOLDER JUDGMENTS OF CONDITION. ALTHOUGH INDIVIDUAL STAKEHOLDER VARIED IN THEIR JUDGMENTS, WE FOUND ONLY RELATIVELY SMALL SYSTEMATIC VARIATIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF STAKEHOLDERS. SIMILARLY, WE FOUND THE DEGREE OF SPECIALIZATION OF EXPERTS HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE CONDITION SCORE. WE ALSO USED GAMS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VEGETATION ATTRIBUTES AND STAKEHOLDER JUDGMENTS OF COLLAPSE, FINDING LITTLE VARIATION BETWEEN GROUPS. WE ALSO EXPLORED THE THRESHOLD OF OVERALL VEGETATION COVER WHERE STAKEHOLDERS ARE LIKELY TO SHIFT THEIR JUDGMENT FROM COLLAPSED TO NOT COLLAPSED, AND WHILE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ECOSYSTEMS WERE OBSERVED, WE FOUND CONSENSUS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WITHIN EACH ECOSYSTEM. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, AT LEAST IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SOUTHERN MONGOLIA, DIVERSE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS HAVE CONVERGENT VIEWS IN RESPECT TO ECOLOGICAL DEGRADATION. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

UNDERSTANDING HOW GIANT PANDA RESPONDS TO THESE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES THUS IS CRITICAL FOR DEVELOPING LONG-TERM EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, UNTIL NOW MOST STUDIES FOCUSED ON ONLY THE EFFECTS OF EITHER CLIMATE CHANGE OR LAND-USE CHANGE ON GIANT PANDA. SO, IF THE POTENTIAL COMBINED EFFECTS OF THESE PROCESSES ARE GREATER THAN EITHER OF THEM, THE CURRENT CONSERVATION RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE OR MISLEADING. HERE, BASED ON TWO NATIONAL SURVEY DATA ON GIANT PANDA OCCURRENCES ACROSS NEARLY THIRTY YEARS, WE QUANTIFIED THE VARIATION OF GIANT PANDA'S POPULATION PERSISTENCE AS A FUNCTION OF LAND-USE (MEASURED AS FOREST-COVER) CHANGE, CLIMATE (MEASURED AS ANNUAL MEAN TEMPERATURE (MAT), ANNUAL MEAN SUMMER TEMPERATURE (MAST) AND ANNUAL MEAN PRECIPITATION (MAP)) CHANGE, AND THE SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF LAND-USE AND CLIMATE CHANGE. WE FOUND FOREST-COVER CHANGE EXPLAINED 38.1% OF GIANT PANDA'S PERSISTENCE VARIATION, WHILE CLIMATE CHANGE EXPLAINED 20.1% OF THE VARIATION, AND THE SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF LAND-USE AND CLIMATE CHANGE EXPLAINED ONLY 1.5% OF THE VARIATION. WE CONFIRMED THAT FOREST-COVER CHANGE SURPASSED CLIMATE CHANGE OR THE SYNERGISTIC EFFECT BETWEEN THEM AS THE GREATEST FORCE DRIVING GIANT PANDA'S POPULATION PERSISTENCE.

SDMS ARE SUBJECTED TO INTRINSIC UNCERTAINTIES, AND CONSERVATION STUDIES HAVE GENERALLY OVERLOOKED THESE. THE INTEGRATION OF SDM UNCERTAINTIES IN CONSERVATION SOLUTIONS REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUITABLE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM. EXACT OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS GRANT EFFICIENCY TO CONSERVATION SOLUTIONS, BUT MOST OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATIONS GENERATE A SINGLE BINARY AND INDIVISIBLE SOLUTION. THEREFORE, WITHOUT VARIATION IN THEIR PARAMETERIZATION, THEY PROVIDE LOW FLEXIBILITY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CONSERVATION SOLUTIONS BY STAKEHOLDERS. CONTRARILY, HEURISTIC ALGORITHMS PROVIDE SUCH FLEXIBILITY, BY GENERATING LARGE AMOUNTS OF SUB-OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, EFFICIENCY AND FLEXIBILITY ARE IMPLICITLY LINKED IN CONSERVATION APPLICATIONS: MATHEMATICALLY EFFICIENT SOLUTIONS PROVIDE LESS FLEXIBILITY, AND THE FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS PROVIDED BY HEURISTICS ARE SUB-OPTIMAL. TO AVOID THIS TRADE-OFF BETWEEN FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY IN SCP, WE PROPOSE A RESERVE-SELECTION FRAMEWORK, BASED ON EXACT OPTIMIZATION COMBINED WITH A POST-SELECTION OF SDM OUTPUTS.

A SAMPLE SURVEY OF FARMERS (N = 400) FROM SOUTH ASIA WAS CONDUCTED TO STUDY THE FARMERS’ PERCEPTION ABOUT DROUGHT IMPACTS ON THEIR SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS, AGRO-BIODIVERSITY, AND ADAPTATION BESIDES PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS’ DROUGHT MITIGATION MEASURES. THE RESULTS REVEALED REDUCED SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER AVAILABILITY, SOIL DEGRADATION, PARTIAL OR COMPLETE CROP FAILURE, INCREASED AGRICULTURAL FALLOWS AND WASTELANDS, BIODIVERSITY LOSS, DECREASE IN AGRICULTURAL YIELDS, PASTURE LANDS, AND LIVESTOCK IN DROUGHT-IMPACTED SOUTH ASIA. ABOUT 16–26% OF THE FARMERS PERCEIVED A REDUCTION IN THE AGRICULTURAL AREA AND PRODUCTION OF COMMERCIAL CROPS AND MILLETS IN DROUGHT-PRONE AREAS, WHILE CHANGES IN THE CROPPING OF PULSES, OILSEEDS, HORTICULTURAL, AND FODDER CROPS WERE MINIMAL. ABOUT 57–92% OF RESPONDENTS SHOWED A REDUCTION IN THE CONSUMPTION OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES, DAIRY PRODUCTS, AND FISH. UNEMPLOYMENT, MIGRATION, REDUCED FARM INCOME, AND MALNUTRITION WERE MAJOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS AMONG RESPONDENTS (38–46%). DESPITE SUFFICIENT PUBLIC SUPPORT AS A MITIGATION STRATEGY, THE FARMERS HAD POOR PARTICIPATION (8–65%) FOR AGRI-INFORMATION AND ADAPTATION (7–36%) AGAINST DROUGHT IMPACTS.

WHILE BD HAS AFFECTED AMPHIBIANS WORLDWIDE, BSAL REMAINS RESTRICTED TO ASIA AND EUROPE, BUT ALSO COULD BE A MAJOR THREAT FOR SALAMANDERS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, INCLUDING THE 320 BOLITOGLOSSINE SPECIES DESCRIBED. HERE, WE PREDICT THE SUITABLE AREAS FOR BSAL IN THE NEOTROPICS AND ASSESS ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON BOLITOGLOSSINE DIVERSITY. FOR THIS, WE DETERMINED THE GEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS OF TAXONOMIC, PHYLOGENETIC, AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY FOR BOLITOGLOSSINES AND MODELED THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF BSAL IN THE NEOTROPICS. WE IDENTIFIED WHICH SPECIES AND REGIONS COULD BE AT RISK FROM AN EVENTUAL INTRODUCTION OF BSAL IN THE REGION, QUANTIFIED THE DEGREE OF OVERLAP BETWEEN REGIONS OF HIGH DIVERSITY AND THE SUITABLE CONDITIONS FOR THE PATHOGEN, AND CONSIDERED SPECIES IUCN RED LIST STATUS, AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE SIZE. WE FOUND THAT REGIONS OF HIGH TAXONOMIC, PHYLOGENETIC, AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE TRANS-MEXICAN VOLCANIC BELT, SIERRA MADRE ORIENTAL, THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF SIERRA MADRE DEL SUR AND THE MOUNTAINS OF OAXACA IN MÉXICO, AS WELL AS THE CHIAPAN-GUATEMALAN HIGHLANDS, AND THE CORDILLERAS OF COSTA RICA AND PANAMA. ALARMINGLY, THE REGIONS OF HIGH DIVERSITY FOR BOLITOGLOSSINES AND OVER 75% OF THE RANGES OF THE MORE THREATENED SPECIES COULD BE AFFECTED BY BSAL. GIVEN THE UNKNOWN VULNERABILITY OF THESE SPECIES, WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND MEASURES TO AVOID THE INTRODUCTION OF BSAL IN THE CONTINENT.

ALTHOUGH CANALS HAVE GREATLY CONTRIBUTED TO BIODIVERSITY LOSS BY DESICCATING WETLANDS, THEY HAVE RECENTLY ATTRACTED CONSERVATION ATTENTION DUE TO THEIR POTENTIAL TO FUNCTION AS REFUGIA FOR NATIVE SPECIES IN INTENSIVELY MANAGED LANDSCAPES. HOWEVER, THEIR CONSERVATION ROLE IN COMPLEX LANDSCAPES COMPOSED OF AGRICULTURAL FIELDS AND DESICCATED BUT OTHERWISE UNTRANSFORMED, SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS, ON WHICH CANALS STILL POSE A HEAVY BURDEN, IS UNKNOWN. IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF DRAINAGE CANALS AND RELATED BIODIVERSITY IN THESE LANDSCAPES COULD HELP UNLOCK THEIR POTENTIAL AND SUPPORT SYNERGISTIC LAND MANAGEMENT FOR NATURE CONSERVATION AND WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. WE APPLIED A MULTI-TAXON APPROACH, INCLUDING PLANTS, BUTTERFLIES, TRUE BUGS, SPIDERS AND BIRDS, TO (A) ASSESS THE CONSERVATION VALUE OF DRAINAGE CANALS WITH TEMPORARY WATER COVER IN A HEAVILY DRAINED EUROPEAN LOWLAND REGION, (B) TO TEST LANDSCAPE-LEVEL AND LOCAL CANAL PARAMETERS FOR AIDING PRIORITIZATION AMONG CANALS AND (C) TO PROPOSE A RECONCILIATION-BASED MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK THAT SUITS THE INTEREST OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS. WE FOUND THAT DRAINAGE CANALS AND THEIR BANKS CONCENTRATE MORE SPECIES ACROSS MOST TAXA THAN SEMI-NATURAL, MOSTLY GRASSLAND HABITATS, POSSIBLY DUE TO MICRO-ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY AND THE ABSENCE OF LOW-INTENSITY ANNUAL MANAGEMENT COMPARED TO GRASSLANDS. CANALS TRAVERSING SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS CONCENTRATE PARTICULARLY HIGH NUMBERS OF NATIVE SPECIES, BUT AGRICULTURAL CANALS ALSO SUPPORT REMARKABLE SPECIES RICHNESS. HOWEVER, AGRICULTURAL CANALS ARE IMPORTANT DISPERSAL CORRIDORS FOR NON-NATIVE INVASIVE PLANTS, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT NATIVE BIODIVERSITY. CANAL SIZE HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON BIODIVERSITY, BUT HABITAT STRESS IS AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT. THE HIGHER THE STRESS (DUE TO SANDINESS AND SALINITY), THE HIGHER THE ADDED VALUE OF CANALS TO LANDSCAPE-WIDE BIODIVERSITY. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. WE SHOW THAT DRAINAGE CANALS CAN HARBOUR HIGH BIODIVERSITY AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE RECOGNIZED AS IMPORTANT NOVEL ECOSYSTEMS WITH HIGH CONSERVATION VALUE, EVEN WHEN CUTTING THROUGH SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND HABITATS. CANALS HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONSIDERED DETRIMENTAL TO NATURE CONSERVATION DUE TO THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH LOSS OF WETLANDS. HOWEVER, BY REDUCING WATER LOSS WITH REVERSIBLE OBSTRUCTIONS, CONTROLLING INVASIVE SPECIES AND APPLYING SPECIFIC CONSERVATION MEASURES, THEY MAY BE TURNED INTO CONSERVATION ALLIES WITHOUT COMPROMISING LONG-TERM INTERESTS OF WATER MANAGEMENT AND AGRICULTURAL LAND USE. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

IN BRAZIL, WHERE MPAS HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED TO REPLENISH BIODIVERSITY, THERE IS A LACK OF REGIONAL-SCALE ANALYSIS OF MPA IMPACTS AND THE FACTORS RELATED TO POSITIVE ECOLOGICAL CHANGE. THIS STUDY AIMS TO QUANTIFY THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF BRAZILIAN MPAS AND TEST WHETHER SOME STUDY AND MPA CHARACTERISTICS (E.G., TAXONOMIC GROUP STUDIED, EXPLOITATION LEVEL OF SPECIES, MPA AREA, PROTECTION TIME, MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS, LEVEL OF CONNECTEDNESS, ETC.) WERE UNDERLYING FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR PERFORMANCE. WE CONDUCTED A STRUCTURED SEARCH IN A DATABASE OF SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES, SELECTING COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF DIRECT BIODIVERSITY METRICS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE MPAS OFFERING DIFFERENT PROTECTION LEVELS (I.E., FULLY- OR PARTIALLY-PROTECTED MPAS) OR WITHIN MPAS WITH DISTINCT ZONES. WE THEN CARRIED OUT A META-ANALYSIS BASED ON 424 OBSERVATIONS FOUND IN 18 ARTICLES. AVERAGED ACROSS ALL STUDIES, WE FOUND THAT MPAS HAD A 17% INCREASE IN THE ABUNDANCE OF SPECIES, LENGTH OF INDIVIDUALS, AND COMMUNITY DIVERSITY. WHEN COMPARED TO OPEN-ACCESS AREAS, FULLY-PROTECTED MPAS INCREASED BIODIVERSITY BY 45%. HOWEVER, MPAS OFFERING PARTIAL PROTECTION HAD VARIABLE EFFECTS, RANGING FROM SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE TO SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECTS. MPA EFFECTS DEPENDED ON THE TAXONOMIC GROUP AND EXPLOITATION LEVEL OF SPECIES, WITH THE STRONGEST POSITIVE EFFECTS SEEN ON EXPLOITED FISH SPECIES AND BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES. PARTIALLY-PROTECTED MPAS THAT REPORTED STRONG POSITIVE EFFECTS REQUIRED LONG TIME OF PROTECTION (>15YEARS) AND HIGH LEVEL OF CONNECTIVITY. CONVERSELY, FULLY-PROTECTED MPAS (I.E., NO-TAKE ONES) COULD BE EFFECTIVE EVEN WHEN SMALL, UNDER INTENSE FISHING PRESSURE IN THEIR SURROUNDINGS, AND REGARDLESS OF THEIR LEVEL OF CONNECTIVITY. WE USED THE BRAZILIAN MPAS AS A CASE STUDY, BUT THESE RESULTS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF MPAS AND DRIVERS OF CONSERVATION SUCCESS, AND OFFER KEY INFORMATION TO CONSOLIDATE MPA NETWORKS THAT SUSTAIN BIODIVERSITY. © 2021 ELSEVIER LTD",113889,NA,JEVMA,"FERREIRA, H.M.; CHICO MENDES INSTITUTE FOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, BRAZIL; EMAIL: HARILDON.FERREIRA.BOLSISTA@ICMBIO.GOV.BR",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113889,"PETROBRASPETROBRAS, 02001.000128/2018 -26 INSTITUTO CHICO MENDES DE CONSERVAÇÃO DA BIODIVERSIDADEINSTITUTO CHICO MENDES DE CONSERVAÇÃO DA BIODIVERSIDADE, ICMBIO, SEI 1777032",3014797,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,NA,NA,15,NA,NA,ACADEMIC PRESS,34610560,SCOPUS,DRIVERS OF ECOLOGICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS: A META-ANALYTIC APPROACH FROM THE SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC OCEAN (BRAZIL),NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116095379&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2021.113889&partnerID=40&md5=e276847fe0a403ece7100ca7d2ba0154,301,2022,"HMF AND RAM ARE THANKFUL TO THE STAFF TEAM MEMBERS WORKING AT THE COORDINATION FOR CREATION OF PROTECTED AREAS OF ICMBIO, FOR THE INSIGHTFUL DISCUSSIONS AND INCENTIVE TO CARRY OUT THIS RESEARCH.

SPINIFEX GRASSES (TRIODIA SPP.) ARE FOUNDATION SPECIES OF ARID AUSTRALIA THAT PROVIDE RESOURCES TO MANY BIRDS, MAMMALS, REPTILES AND INVERTEBRATES. WE TESTED DRIVERS OF TRIODIA SCARIOSA PRESENCE AND ABUNDANCE AT LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE SCALES USING A BAYESIAN STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL AND SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELLING, BASED ON THE MAPPED DISTRIBUTION OF 11,887 SPINIFEX PLANTS IN REMNANT VEGETATION ACROSS A ~12,000 KM2 AGRICULTURAL REGION. AT THE LOCAL SCALE (&LT;1 KM), THERE WAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF SOIL PHOSPHORUS ON SPINIFEX ABUNDANCE, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE PREVALENCE OF OTHER GRASSES WAS HIGH. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE COMBINATION OF OTHER GRASSES AND NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT PROMOTE HOSTILE CONDITIONS FOR SPINIFEX IN SMALL AGRICULTURAL REMNANTS, POSSIBLY THROUGH ALTERED COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS. HOWEVER, AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE (100 + KM), THERE WAS A POSITIVE EFFECT OF PHOSPHORUS ON SPINIFEX ABUNDANCE, REINFORCING THE IMPORTANCE OF MULTI-SCALE STUDIES. SPINIFEX PRESENCE AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE WAS BEST DETERMINED BY PROXIMITY TO NATURE RESERVES. SITES CLOSEST TO RESERVES WERE CLEARED LATER THAN MORE DISTANT SITES, WHICH SUGGESTS A TRAJECTORY OF DECLINE CONSISTENT WITH AN EXTINCTION DEBT.

ECOL.,1,"CONTEXT: FOREST LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION ARE RAPIDLY EXPANDING ACROSS THE TROPICS. ALTHOUGH FOREST LOSS IS A MAJOR DRIVER OF THE CURRENT BIODIVERSITY CRISIS, THE EFFECT OF FRAGMENTATION REMAINS DEBATED, PARTICULARLY FOR FOREST-SPECIALIST SPECIES. OBJECTIVES: WE EVALUATED THE UNIVARIATE AND COMBINED EFFECT OF FOREST LOSS (PERCENT OF FOREST COVER) AND FRAGMENTATION (FOREST PATCH DENSITY) ON POPULATIONS OF A FOREST-SPECIALIST PRIMATE, THE BLACK-FRONTED TITI MONKEY (CALLICEBUS NIGRIFRONS), IN THE LANDSCAPES FROM A TRANSITIONAL ZONE BETWEEN ATLANTIC FOREST AND CERRADO BIOMES. METHODS: WE SURVEYED TITI MONKEY DENSITY IN 14 LANDSCAPES. USING A MULTISCALE AND MULTIMODEL INFERENCE APPROACH, WE TESTED THE RELATIVE EFFECT OF EACH LANDSCAPE VARIABLE ASSESSED AT THEIR RESPECTIVE SCALES OF EFFECT ON TITI MONKEY DENSITY. RESULTS: TITI MONKEY DENSITY RANGED FROM 0 TO 12 GROUPS/KM2 AND WAS BEST PREDICTED BY THE COMBINED EFFECT OF FOREST COVER AND PATCH DENSITY. DENSITY INCREASED IN FOREST PATCHES EMBEDDED IN MORE DEFORESTED AND FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPES. INTERESTINGLY, THE EFFECT OF FOREST PATCH DENSITY WAS CONSISTENTLY POSITIVE ALONG THE ENTIRE EVALUATED FOREST COVER GRADIENT (9–42%). CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS SUPPORT THAT FRAGMENTATION PER SE CAN HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON BIODIVERSITY, IN THIS CASE, BY INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT MORE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE ‘RESCUED’ FROM DEFORESTATION AND CROWDED IN THE REMAINING FOREST PATCHES. ALTHOUGH THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF LIVING CROWDED IN FOREST PATCHES ARE UNKNOWN, A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH FOR PRESERVING THIS (AND POTENTIALLY OTHER) FOREST-SPECIALIST SPECIES COULD BE TO PROMOTE FOREST RESTORATION PROJECTS FOCUSED ON INCREASING THE NUMBER AND/OR SIZE OF FOREST PATCHES IN THE LANDSCAPE (I.E., REVERSE FRAGMENTATION). © 2021, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER NATURE B.V.",NA,NA,LAECE,"GESTICH, C.C.; DEPARTAMENTO DE BIOLOGIA ANIMAL, SP, BRAZIL; EMAIL: CARLAGESTICH@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1007/s10980-021-01336-1,"260108/004.263/2013 NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCILNATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL, NERC, 2013/50421-2, 2020/01779-5, NE/S011811/1 FUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SÃO PAULOFUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SÃO PAULO, FAPESP, 2012/14245-2, GESTBRAZ0510 COORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIORCOORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIOR, CAPES, 2013/24453-4 EMPRESA BRASILEIRA DE PESQUISA AGROPECUÁRIAEMPRESA BRASILEIRA DE PESQUISA AGROPECUÁRIA, EMBRAPA CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICO, CNPQ, 312045/2013-1, 312292/2016-3, 442147/2020-1, 88881.068425/2014-01",9212973,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,6,1,147-157,SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,FOREST LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION CAN PROMOTE THE CROWDING EFFECT IN A FOREST-SPECIALIST PRIMATE,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114144351&doi=10.1007%2fs10980-021-01336-1&partnerID=40&md5=1dbc96a9560e6f3de19c9f0b88ebab97,37,2022,"WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE LANDOWNERS FOR GRANTING PERMISSION TO COLLECT DATA ON THEIR PROPERTIES.

MACROFAUNA ARE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE BELOWGROUND BIODIVERSITY, AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOIL ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS AND SOIL PROCESSES. THE RESPONSE OF SOIL MACROFAUNA TO CROPPING PATTERN IS CRUCIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE SOIL ECOLOGICAL DYNAMICS AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. HEREIN, WE ESTABLISHED AN EXPERIMENT OF RICE (ORYZA SATIVA L.)-BASED DOUBLE CROPPING SYSTEM IN JIANGSU PROVINCE, CHINA SINCE 2016 TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF ROTATION REGIMES ON SOIL PROPERTIES AND SOIL MACROFAUNA COMMUNITIES. THE RICE-BASED DOUBLE CROPPING SYSTEM INCLUDED RICE–WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM L.), RICE-OILSEED RAPE (BRASSICA CAMPESTRIS L.), RICE-TINY VETCH (VICIA HIRSUTA L.), RICE-BROAD BEAN (VICIA FABA L.), AND RICE-FALLOW. AFTER 3-YEAR ROTATIONS, SOIL MACROFAUNAL BIODIVERSITY AND TROPHIC STRUCTURE VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH SOIL PROPERTIES. THE HIGHER BIODIVERSITY INDICES WERE FOUND IN THE TINY VETCH (USED AS GREEN MANURE IN SITU) AND FALLOW FIELDS. IN ADDITION, SOIL ORGANIC CARBON (SOC), THE MAIN FACTOR FOR SHAPING THE SOIL ENVIRONMENT AND REGULATING THE SOIL MACROFAUNAL COMMUNITIES, WAS IMPROVED. WHILE SOIL WATER CONTENT AND PH WERE SELECTED TO PREDICT EACH TROPHIC RICHNESS AND DENSITY IN MOST OF THE OPTIMAL REGRESSION MODELS, CHANGES IN SOIL MACROFAUNAL COMMUNITIES SHOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED AS COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSES TO THE SOIL ENVIRONMENTS (FOOD RESOURCES, MICROHABITATS ETC.)

THE RED-CROWNED AMAZON AMAZONA VIRIDIGENALIS IS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES THAT HAS BECOME NATURALIZED IN MULTIPLE URBAN AREAS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO, AND THESE POPULATIONS MAY CURRENTLY OUTNUMBER THE POPULATION WITHIN THEIR HISTORICAL HABITAT.

TO DETERMINE A TIMELINE OF RED-CROWNED AMAZON ARRIVAL AND GROWTH IN THE LRGV, WE REVIEWED PUBLISHED LITERATURE AND ONLINE CITIZEN SCIENCE DATABASES. TO QUANTIFY CURRENT POPULATION LEVELS AND TRENDS, WE CONDUCTED 412 SURVEYS AT ALL KNOWN ROOST SITES THROUGHOUT THE LRGV FROM JANUARY 2016 THROUGH APRIL 2019.

WHILE ECOACOUSTIC MONITORING IS INCREASINGLY BEING USED AND SHOWS PROMISE, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF THE BIG DATA PRODUCED REMAINS A CHALLENGE. COMPUTER-GENERATED ACOUSTIC INDICES POTENTIALLY PROVIDE A BIOLOGICALLY MEANINGFUL SUMMARY OF SOUND, HOWEVER, TEMPORAL AUTOCORRELATION, DIFFICULTIES IN STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF MULTI-INDEX DATA AND LACK OF CONSISTENCY OR TRANSFERABILITY IN DIFFERENT TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS HAVE HINDERED THE APPLICATION OF THOSE INDICES IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WE INVESTIGATE THE USE OF TIME-SERIES MOTIF DISCOVERY AND RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFICATION OF MULTI-INDICES THROUGH TWO CASE STUDIES. WE USE A SEMI-AUTOMATED WORKFLOW COMBINING TIME-SERIES MOTIF DISCOVERY AND RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFICATION OF MULTI-INDEX (ACOUSTIC COMPLEXITY, TEMPORAL ENTROPY, AND EVENTS PER SECOND) DATA TO CATEGORIZE SOUNDS IN UNFILTERED RECORDINGS ACCORDING TO THE MAIN SOURCE OF SOUND PRESENT (BIRDS, INSECTS, GEOPHONY). OUR APPROACH SHOWED MORE THAN 70% ACCURACY IN LABEL ASSIGNMENT IN BOTH DATASETS. THE CATEGORIES ASSIGNED WERE BROAD, BUT WE BELIEVE THIS IS A GREAT IMPROVEMENT ON TRADITIONAL SINGLE INDEX ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RECORDINGS AS WE CAN NOW GIVE ECOLOGICAL MEANING TO RECORDINGS IN A SEMI-AUTOMATED WAY THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND MANUAL VALIDATION IS ONLY NECESSARY FOR A SMALL SUBSET OF THE DATA. FURTHERMORE, TEMPORAL AUTOCORRELATION, WHICH IS LARGELY IGNORED BY RESEARCHERS, HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED THROUGH THE TIME-SERIES MOTIF DISCOVERY TECHNIQUE APPLIED HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO ECOACOUSTIC DATA. WE EXPECT THAT OUR APPROACH WILL GREATLY ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN THE FUTURE AS IT WILL ALLOW LARGE DATASETS TO BE RAPIDLY PROCESSED AND LABELED, ENABLING THE SCREENING OF RECORDINGS FOR UNDESIRED SOUNDS, SUCH AS WIND, OR TARGET BIOPHONY (INSECTS AND BIRDS) FOR BIODIVERSITY MONITORING OR BIOACOUSTICS RESEARCH.

HISTORICALLY, RAVENS HAVE RECEIVED SPECIAL ATTENTION IN HUMAN CULTURE, BEING EITHER RESPECTED OR VILIFIED. IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES, RAVENS ARE EXPLOITING THE EXPANDING HUMAN ENTERPRISE, WHICH PROVIDES THEM WITH UNINTENDED SUBSIDIES OF FOOD, WATER, AND BREEDING LOCATIONS, ALLOWING RAVENS TO EXPAND THEIR RANGE AND INCREASE IN POPULATION DENSITY AND RESULTING IN RAVEN DEPREDATION THREATENING SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN. FROM A CONSERVATION BIOLOGY PERSPECTIVE, INCREASED RAVEN POPULATIONS PRESENT A DIFFICULT CHALLENGE IN MANAGING HUMAN–WILDLIFE CONFLICT. SOME RAVEN CONTROL MEASURES ARE EFFECTIVE EMPIRICALLY BUT PRESENT ETHICAL DILEMMAS, ARE ECONOMICALLY EXPENSIVE, OR ARE SOCIALLY DIVISIVE.

HERE, BY CHARACTERIZING THE OUTCOMES AND DIFFERENCES OF THE EPIZOOCHORIC SEED DISPERSAL CARRIED OUT BY TWO SPECIES OF FRUGIVOROUS BATS (ARTIBEUS PHAEOTIS AND URODERMA CONVEXUM) IN A NEOTROPICAL FOREST, WE TESTED THE PREDICTION THAT, THROUGH THEIR FEEDING ACTIVITY, BOTH BAT SPECIES DISPERSE AND INFLUENCE THE SUBSEQUENT SEEDLING SURVIVAL OF MULTIPLE SEED SPECIES. BY DIRECT SAMPLING ON BATS' DISPERSING SITES AND SURROUNDING AREAS, WE FOUND EVIDENCE OF THE DISPERSAL OF 2,310 SEEDS OF EIGHT PLANT SPECIES, OF WHICH 118 SURVIVED TO BECOME SEEDLINGS. THE TOTAL DENSITY OF SEEDS AND THE SEEDLING SURVIVAL WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN AREAS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY THE BATS (I.E., FEEDING ROOSTS) THAN IN PERIPHERAL AREAS. POSITIVE DENSITY-DEPENDENT EFFECTS NEVERTHELESS WERE DETECTED IN BOTH SAMPLING AREAS (FEEDING ROOSTS AND PERIPHERAL AREAS). INTERSPECIFIC COMPARISONS SHOWED THAT DESPITE BOTH BAT SPECIES HAVING SIMILAR DISPERSAL OUTCOMES, SEEDLINGS IN PERIPHERAL AREAS RELATED TO A. PHAEOTIS HAVE BETTER SURVIVAL RATES. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT BOTH BAT SPECIES PRIMARILY DISPERSE BY EPIZOOCHORIC MEANS SEEDS OF VARIOUS TREE SPECIES AT SEVERAL LOCALITIES IN THE STUDY SITE. THIS RESULT, TOGETHER WITH THE POSITIVE DENSITY-DEPENDENT EFFECTS, SUGGESTS THAT BATS ARE MOVING SEEDS AWAY FROM MATERNAL TREES AND DEPOSITING THEM IN LOCATIONS WHERE SOME OF THE SEEDS CAN GERMINATE, ESTABLISH, AND SURVIVE, THEREBY HIGHLIGHTING THE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE BAT SPECIES TO THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF TREES INHABITING NEOTROPICAL HABITATS.

HOWEVER, IT IS STILL UNKNOWN HOW THE COMBINED EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND FLOW REGULATION RELATED TO HYDROPOWER GENERATION MAY AFFECT FISH ASSEMBLAGES IN THE DOWNSTREAM RIVER REACHES BELOW THE LITHUANIAN HPPS. IN THIS STUDY, THE PHYSICAL HABITAT MODELLING SYSTEM MESOHABSIM WAS USED TO SIMULATE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL CHANGES IN AQUATIC HABITATS AVAILABILITY FOR DIFFERENT FISH SPECIES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HPP AT DIFFERENT CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS. CHANGES IN THE AVAILABLE HABITAT WERE ASSESSED FOR COMMON FISH SPECIES IN FOUR HPP-AFFECTED RIVERS REPRESENTING DIFFERENT HYDROLOGICAL REGIONS OF LITHUANIA. THE MODELLING RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE OPERATION OF HPP UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE CONDITIONS IN MOST RIVERS COULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR SMALL BENTHIC FISH SPECIES SUCH AS GUDGEON GOBIO GOBIO AND STONE LOACH BARBATULA BARBATULA.

THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE DEFORESTATION FOR OIL PALM BECAUSE IT POSES THE HIGHEST RISK FOR WILDLIFE COMPARED TO OTHER HABITATS. THE TAXON AFFINITY AND REGIONAL CHARACTERIZATION FACTORS SHOW THE RISK TO WILDLIFE (BIRDS AND INSECTS) IN THE FORMERLY NATURAL HABITAT AREAS (I.E., DECIDUOUS, EVERGREEN, AND MANGROVE FORESTS). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF ANIMAL SURVIVAL IN FORMER MANGROVE FORESTS IS HIGHER THAN IN OTHER FORESTS UPON OCCUPATION, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE TAXON AFFINITY. LIKEWISE, DEFORESTATION IN THE NORTHERN REGION CAUSES THE LEAST SPECIES LOSS PER AREA, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE LOWEST AVERAGE REGIONAL CHARACTERIZATION FACTOR, BECAUSE SPECIES DENSITIES ARE LOWEST. HOWEVER, THE IMPACTS ON SPECIES RICHNESS DEPEND ON THE TAXON AND THE COMBINATION OF THE REGION AND THE FOREST TYPE.

WE STUDIED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF BOTH “VULNERABLE” AND “ENDANGERED” SPECIES ON REGIONAL LISTS OF THREATENED SPECIES AND APPROVED MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR SUCH SPECIES (MANDATORY) WITH ECOLOGICAL (E.G. PERCENTAGE OF FOREST AND AGRICULTURAL AREAS), SOCIAL (E.G. ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS AND GPD PER CAPITA) AND GEOGRAPHICAL (E.G. TOTAL AND PROTECTED AREAS) VARIABLES ON THE REGIONAL SCALE. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT AN APPROVED MANAGEMENT PLAN IS AVAILABLE FOR ONLY 20% OF THREATENED TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES AND THERE WERE IMPORTANT TAXONOMICAL AND REGIONAL BIASES. HIGHER PROTECTION LEVELS APPEARED IN REGIONS WITH HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF PROTECTED AREA, MORE CITIZENS’ ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS, LOWER GPD PER CAPITA AND SHORTER REGIONAL LISTS. HERPETOFAUNA HAS FEWER APPROVED MANAGEMENT PLANS THAN MAMMALS OR BIRDS.

HOWEVER, TO PREVENT BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND REDUCE THE RISK OF LOCAL EXTINCTIONS, BLUE AND GREEN SPACES NEED TO BE CONNECTED BY CORRIDORS, SO THAT ORGANISMS MAY DISPERSE BETWEEN SITES. LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY AFFECTS LOCAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND METACOMMUNITY DYNAMICS BY FACILITATING DISPERSAL. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO TEST THE RELATIVE ROLES OF POND ENVIRONMENTAL PROPERTIES, SPATIAL STRUCTURE, AND FUNCTIONAL LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY ON DIFFERENTIATION OF INVERTEBRATE METACOMMUNITIES IN URBAN PONDS IN THE CITY OF STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN. WE CHARACTERIZED FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY AS BLUE CONNECTIVITY (DISTANCE TO WATER BODIES), GREEN CONNECTIVITY (LAND USE), AND COMBINED BLUE-GREEN CONNECTIVITY. WE ESTIMATED FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY BY USING ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT THEORY TO IDENTIFY DISPERSAL CORRIDORS. INTERESTINGLY, WHILE CIRCUIT THEORY IS OFTEN USED IN SINGLE-TAXON STUDIES, THIS METHOD HAS RARELY BEEN APPLIED TO MULTIPLE TAXA FORMING A METACOMMUNITY, AS WE HAVE DONE IN THIS STUDY. INDEED, OUR STUDY CONTRIBUTES TOWARD AN INCREASED FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF DISPERSAL AT THE METACOMMUNITY LEVEL. WE DETERMINED THAT FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN EXPLAINING COMMUNITY DIFFERENTIATION, WITH THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT CONTRIBUTING COMPARATIVELY LITTLE, AND SPATIAL STRUCTURE THE LEAST. COMBINED BLUE-GREEN FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY HAD A MAJOR INFLUENCE ON STRUCTURING URBAN POND COMMUNITIES, EXPLAINING 7.8% OF THE VARIANCE IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION ACROSS PONDS. FURTHERMORE, WE FOUND THAT INCREASED FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SPECIES. IN SUMMARY, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TO PRESERVE BIODIVERSITY IN URBAN PONDS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENHANCE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY, AND THAT OPEN GREEN SPACES COULD AUGMENT BLUE CORRIDORS IN MAINTAINING FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN URBAN POND METACOMMUNITIES.

WE INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE VARIABLES ON NATIVE BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE. WE SURVEYED BIRDS AND VEGETATION IN 449 SAMPLING POINTS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE CITY. NATIVE BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS WAS GREATER IN AREAS WITH GREATER SHRUB AND WOODY VEGETATION COVER AT THE LOCAL SCALE. NATIVE BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS WAS ALSO GREATER WITH HIGH VEGETATION DENSITY IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE AND NEAR TO AN URBAN BOUNDARY. NATIVE BIRDS WERE ABUNDANT IN AREAS WITH LARGE WOODY VEGETATION COVER AT BOTH LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE SCALES, HIGH VEGETATION DENSITY IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE, NEAR TO AN URBAN PARK AND NEAR TO AN URBAN BOUNDARY. ADDITIVE EFFECTS OF VEGETATION AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES SUGGEST THAT COMBINING LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT, PLANNING AND DESIGN WILL BE BEST TO PRESERVE NATIVE BIRDS IN A LARGE CITY. ALTHOUGH NATIVE BIRDS ARE SPECIES RICH AND ABUNDANT NEAR THE URBAN FRINGE AND DECREASE TOWARDS THE INTERIOR OF THE CITY, LOCAL-SCALE MANAGEMENT OF HABITAT ENCOURAGING SHRUB AND TREE PLANTING AND LANDSCAPE-SCALE ACTIONS SUCH AS TARGETING HIGH LEVELS OF VEGETATION (INCLUDING WOODY COVER) AND PROVIDING A WELL-DISTRIBUTED NETWORK OF URBAN PARKS WILL HELP SUSTAIN NATIVE BIRDS ACROSS THE CITY.

HOWEVER, TO DATE, ASSESSMENTS OF PARASITE DIVERSITY IN PROTECTED NATURE RESERVES ARE RARE. TO EXPAND OUR KNOWLEDGE OF PARASITE COMMUNITIES IN NATURAL HABITATS, WE EXAMINED 1994 MOLLUSCS BELONGING TO 15 SPECIES FOR TREMATODE INFECTIONS IN A CENTRAL EUROPEAN NATURAL RESERVE.

HOWEVER, THE PARASITE DIVERSITY AND PREVALENCE DID NOT DIFFER MARKEDLY FROM TREMATODE COMMUNITIES IN NON-PROTECTED ENVIRONMENTS, WHICH MIGHT BE PARTLY EXPLAINED BY A DILUTION EFFECT CAUSED BY A HIGH NUMBER OF NON-HOST ORGANISMS IN OUR STUDY SYSTEM.

WHILST THE POTENTIAL FOR GARDEN PONDS TO SERVE AS IMPORTANT BIODIVERSITY RESOURCES IN URBAN AREAS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES, QUANTIFYING THE CONTRIBUTION OF GARDEN PONDS TO URBAN FRESHWATER DIVERSITY HAS BEEN LARGELY NEGLECTED. THIS STUDY AIMS TO QUANTIFY THE TAXONOMIC RICHNESS, COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND CONSERVATION VALUE OF AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATES IN DOMESTIC GARDEN AND NON-URBAN PONDS. TAXONOMIC RICHNESS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN GARDEN PONDS THAN NON-URBAN PONDS AT AN ALPHA AND GAMMA SCALE. A GREATER RICHNESS OF ODONATA, COLEOPTERA, GASTROPODA AND HEMIPTERA WERE RECORDED IN NON-URBAN PONDS. GARDEN PONDS WERE FOUND TO SUPPORT COMPOSITIONALLY DIFFERENT MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES COMPARED TO NON-URBAN PONDS, INFLUENCED BY VARIATION IN WATER DEPTH AND CONDUCTIVITY. A TOTAL OF 23 TAXA WERE RECORDED FROM GARDEN PONDS ONLY. NON-URBAN PONDS HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CONSERVATION VALUE COMPARED TO GARDEN PONDS (87% OF GARDEN PONDS WERE OF LOW OR MODERATE CONSERVATION VALUE, WHILE ONLY 35% OF NON-URBAN PONDS WERE IN THESE CATEGORIES). ALTHOUGH GARDEN PONDS CURRENTLY SUPPORT LIMITED MACROINVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY AND HAVE LOWER CONSERVATION VALUE, THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE REGIONAL SPECIES POOL AND THEIR POTENTIAL TO LIMIT FUTURE URBAN BIODIVERSITY LOSS IS SIGNIFICANT. GIVEN THEIR HIGH ABUNDANCE AND POPULARITY WITHIN THE URBAN LANDSCAPE, CLEAR GUIDANCE IS REQUIRED FOR POND-OWNERS ON HOW TO BEST MANAGE GARDEN PONDS TO SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN BIODIVERSITY.

RIVERINE ECOSYSTEMS OF THE HIMALAYAN FOOTHILL FORESTS OF INDIA ARE A STRONGHOLD OF THE VULNERABLE SMOOTH-COATED OTTER POPULATIONS. THIS STUDY ENTAILS THE UNDERSTANDING OF RESOURCE UTILISATION BY THE SMOOTH-COATED OTTER (LUTROGALE PERSPICILLATA) IN TERMS OF HABITAT USE AND DIETARY COMPOSITION IN SEVEN RIVERS ALONG THE HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS IN INDIA. WE SURVEYED 121.09 KM OF RIVERS FOR OTTER SIGNS AND ASSOCIATED HABITAT VARIABLES. USING GENERALISED LINEAR MODELS, WE ASSESSED THE FACTORS INFLUENCING OTTER HABITAT USE. WE ESTIMATED THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE AND CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT OF FISH SPECIES AND EVALUATED OTTER DIET BASED ON SPRAINT SAMPLES (N = 120) USING FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE AND SCORE-BULK ESTIMATE METHODS. HABITAT USE BY OTTERS IS GOVERNED BY A COMBINATION OF HABITAT COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE INTRICATELY LINKED TO DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS FEEDING, GROOMING, AND DENNING. WE FOUND THAT HABITAT USE WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH CHANNEL DEPTH, MODERATE VEGETATION, AND BANK SUBSTRATE TYPES – BEDROCK, BOULDERS, SAND, AND GRASS. WHEREAS, INCREASING DISTANCE TO ESCAPE COVER, SPARSE VEGETATION, CHANNEL WIDTH, AND ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE NEGATIVELY INFLUENCED HABITAT USE. DIETARY ANALYSES REVEALED THAT RELATIVELY ABUNDANT FISH SPECIES VIZ., TOR PUTITORA AND BARILIUS VAGRA, PREDOMINATED THE DIET OF OTTERS. ECHOING THE PRINCIPLES OF OPTIMAL FORAGING THEORY, OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT SMALL-MEDIUM SIZED FISHES OF THE SIZE RANGE 79.05–199.92 MM, WERE CONSUMED MORE OFTEN, AND LARGER FISHES (> 263.24 MM) WERE CONSUMED OPPORTUNISTICALLY. OUR FINDINGS PROVIDE IMPORTANT CONSERVATION INSIGHTS ON THE STATUS OF THE SMOOTH-COATED OTTER, THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH DIFFERENT HABITAT COMPONENTS, AND DIETARY SPECTRUM IN RIVERS OF THE HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS.

ECOL.,1,"RAPID BIODIVERSITY LOSS HAS TRIGGERED DECADES OF RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BIODIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY STABILITY. RECENT STUDIES HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF SPECIES TRAITS FOR UNDERSTANDING BIODIVERSITY–STABILITY RELATIONSHIPS. THE SPECIES WITH HIGH GROWTH RATES (‘FAST’ SPECIES) ARE EXPECTED TO BE LESS RESISTANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS BUT RECOVER FASTER IF DISTURBED; IN CONTRAST, THE SPECIES WITH SLOW GROWTH RATES (‘SLOW’ SPECIES) CAN BE MORE RESISTANT BUT RECOVER MORE SLOWLY IF DISTURBED. SUCH A ‘FAST–SLOW’ TRAIT CONTINUUM PROVIDES A NEW PERSPECTIVE FOR UNDERSTANDING COMMUNITY STABILITY, BUT ITS VALIDITY HAS MAINLY BEEN EXAMINED IN PLANT COMMUNITIES. HERE, WE INVESTIGATE HOW ‘FAST–SLOW’ TRAIT COMPOSITION, TOGETHER WITH SPECIES RICHNESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, REGULATE AVIAN COMMUNITY STABILITY AT A CONTINENTAL SCALE. WE USED BIRD POPULATION RECORDS FROM THE NORTH AMERICAN BREEDING BIRD SURVEY DURING 1988–2017 AND DEFINED AVIAN COMMUNITY STABILITY AS THE TEMPORAL INVARIABILITY OF TOTAL COMMUNITY BIOMASS. WE CALCULATED SPECIES RICHNESS AND THE COMMUNITY–WEIGHTED MEAN (CWM) AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY (FD) OF FOUR KEY LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS, INCLUDING BODY SIZE, NESTLING PERIOD (I.E. PERIOD OF EGG INCUBATION AND YOUNG BIRD FLEDGING), LIFE SPAN AND CLUTCH SIZE (I.E. ANNUAL TOTAL NUMBER OF EGGS). ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INCLUDED TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION AND LEAF AREA INDEX (LAI). OUR ANALYSES SHOWED THAT AVIAN COMMUNITY STABILITY WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY THE CWM OF THE ‘FAST–SLOW’ TRAIT. COMMUNITIES DOMINATED BY ‘FAST’ SPECIES (I.E. SPECIES WITH SMALL BODY SIZE, SHORT NESTLING PERIOD AND LIFE SPAN AND LARGE CLUTCH SIZE) WERE MORE STABLE THAN THOSE DOMINATED BY ‘SLOW’ SPECIES (I.E. SPECIES WITH LARGE BODY SIZE, LONG NESTLING PERIOD AND LIFE SPAN AND SMALL CLUTCH SIZE). SPECIES RICHNESS AND THE FD OF THE ‘FAST–SLOW’ TRAIT EXPLAINED MUCH SMALLER PROPORTIONS OF VARIATION IN AVIAN COMMUNITY STABILITY. TEMPERATURE HAD DIRECT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON AVIAN COMMUNITY STABILITY, WHILE PRECIPITATION AND LEAF AREA INDEX AFFECTED COMMUNITY STABILITY INDIRECTLY BY INFLUENCING SPECIES RICHNESS AND TRAIT COMPOSITION. OUR STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT COMPOSITION OF ‘FAST–SLOW’ TRAITS IS THE MAJOR BIOTIC DRIVER OF AVIAN COMMUNITY STABILITY OVER NORTH AMERICA. TEMPERATURE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ABIOTIC FACTOR, BUT ITS EFFECT IS WEAKER THAN THAT OF THE ‘FAST–SLOW’ TRAIT. AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK COMBINING ‘FAST–SLOW’ TRAIT COMPOSITION AND TEMPERATURE IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSE OF AVIAN COMMUNITIES IN A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT.

FOR SHALLOW LAKES, DECREASING RAINFALL VOLUME AND TIMING, CHANGING REGIONAL WIND PATTERNS AND INCREASED EVAPORATION RATES ALTER WATER REGIMES SO THAT DRY PERIODS OCCUR MORE FREQUENTLY AND FOR LONGER. DRIER CONDITIONS MAY AFFECT FAUNA DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY THROUGH ALTERED PHYSICOCHEMICAL CONDITIONS IN LAKES. ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE PREDICTED NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH CHANGES ON AQUATIC BIODIVERSITY, EMPIRICAL STUDIES DEMONSTRATING THESE EFFECTS ARE RARE. GLOBAL WARMING HAS CAUSED SEVERE CLIMATIC DRYING IN SOUTHWESTERN AUSTRALIA SINCE THE 1970S, SO WE AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER LAKES IN THIS REGION SHOWED IMPACTS ON LAKE HYDROPERIOD, WATER QUALITY, AND Α, Β AND Γ DIVERSITY OF LAKE INVERTEBRATES FROM 1998 TO 2011. SEVENTEEN LAKES ACROSS A RANGE OF SALINITIES WERE SAMPLED BIENNIALLY IN SPRING IN THE WHEATBELT AND GREAT SOUTHERN REGIONS OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES WERE USED TO IDENTIFY CHANGES IN Α, Β AND Γ DIVERSITY AND EXAMINE PATTERNS IN PHYSICOCHEMICAL DATA. SALINITY AND AVERAGE RAINFALL PARTIALLY EXPLAINED PATTERNS IN INVERTEBRATE RICHNESS AND ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION. CLIMATIC DRYING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN LAKE DEPTH, INCREASED FREQUENCY OF DRY PERIODS, AND REDUCED Α AND Γ DIVERSITY (Γ DECLINED FROM ~300 TO ~100 TAXA FROM 1998 TO 2011 IN THE 17 WETLANDS). IN CONTRAST, Β DIVERSITY REMAINED CONSISTENTLY HIGH, BECAUSE EACH LAKE RETAINED A DISTINCT FAUNA. MEAN Α DIVERSITY PER-LAKE DECLINED BOTH IN LAKES THAT DRIED AND LAKES THAT DID NOT DRY OUT, BUT LAKES WHICH RETAINED A GREATER PROPORTION OF THEIR MAXIMUM DEPTH RETAINED MORE Α DIVERSITY. ACCUMULATED LOSSES IN Α DIVERSITY CAUSED THE DECLINE IN Γ DIVERSITY LIKELY THROUGH SHRINKING HABITAT AREA, FEWER STEPPING STONES FOR DISPERSAL AND LOSS OF SPECIFIC HABITAT TYPES.

THE FREE-LIVING ZOOSPORES OF THE CAUSATIVE AGENTS OF THIS DISEASE, THE CHYTRID PATHOGENS BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS (BD) AND BATRACHOCHYTRIUM SALAMANDRIVORANS (BSAL), ARE A POTENTIAL FOOD SOURCE FOR FILTER-FEEDING MICROPREDATORS AS PART OF THE AQUATIC FOOD WEB. WHILE CONSUMPTION OF ZOOSPORES CAN LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL PATHOGEN LOADS, ALTERNATIVE FOOD SOURCES MAY INTERFERE WITH PATHOGEN REMOVAL RATES. WE COMPARED THE ABILITY OF THREE FILTER-FEEDING ZOOPLANKTON SPECIES, THE CLADOCERAN DAPHNIA MAGNA, THE ROTIFER BRACHIONUS CALYCIFLORUS AND THE OSTRACOD HETEROCYPRIS INCONGRUENS, TO REMOVE BD ZOOSPORES IN WATER AND INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF ALTERNATIVE FOOD SOURCES, THE GREEN ALGAE PSEUDOKIRCHNERIELLA SUBCAPITATA AND CHLORELLA VULGARIS, ON ZOOSPORE INGESTION BY D.

QUANTIFYING THESE BENEFITS IS RARE, YET CAN LEAD TO INNOVATIVE CONSERVATION SOLUTIONS. TO ASSESS THESE BENEFITS, WE EXAMINED THE FEEDING ECOLOGY AND POPULATION SIZE OF PERI-URBAN SPOTTED HYENAS CROCUTA CROCUTA IN MEKELLE, ETHIOPIA. WE INTEGRATED THESE FIELD DATA INTO A DISEASE TRANSMISSION MODEL TO PREDICT: (A) THE NUMBER OF ANTHRAX AND BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS (BTB) INFECTIONS ARISING IN HUMANS AND LIVESTOCK FROM INFECTED CARCASS WASTE AND (B) THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TREATING THESE INFECTIONS AND LOSING LIVESTOCK. WE COMPARED THESE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES UNDER TWO SCENARIOS: (A) HYENAS ARE PRESENT AND (B) THE COUNTERFACTUAL, HYENAS ARE ABSENT. WE ESTIMATED THAT HYENAS ANNUALLY REMOVE 4.2% (207 TONNES) OF THE TOTAL CARCASS WASTE DISPOSED OF BY RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES IN MEKELLE. FURTHERMORE, THE SCAVENGING BEHAVIOUR OF HYENAS ANNUALLY PREVENTS FIVE INFECTIONS OF ANTHRAX AND BTB IN HUMANS, AND 140 INFECTIONS IN CATTLE, SHEEP AND GOATS. THIS DISEASE CONTROL SERVICE POTENTIALLY SAVES USD 52,165 DUE TO THE TREATMENT COSTS AND LIVESTOCK LOSS AVOIDED. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THIS HUMAN–HYENA INTERACTION IN ETHIOPIA IS EVIDENCE THAT LARGE CARNIVORES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO HUMAN HEALTH AND ECONOMY. TO RETAIN THESE BENEFITS AND MAINTAIN TOLERANCE OF HYENAS, WE RECOMMEND INTRODUCING EDUCATION PROGRAMMES TO PROMOTE SAFE OUTDOOR BEHAVIOUR AROUND HYENAS, TRAINING WATCHDOGS TO ALERT RESIDENTS OF HYENA PRESENCE, CONSTRUCTING BOMAS TO PROTECT LIVESTOCK FROM HYENA ATTACKS, AND PRESERVING THE HYENAS' ACCESS TO CARCASS WASTE TO REDUCE THEIR DEPENDENCY ON LIVESTOCK PREDATION.

HIGHLY MOBILE SPECIES, SUCH AS AERIAL INVERTEBRATES MAY BE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY LAND COVER AT LARGE SPATIAL SCALES DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO DISPERSE. ASSESSING THE EFFICACY OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY FARMING, SUCH AS AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES (AES), THEREFORE, REQUIRES ESTABLISHING THE INFLUENCE OF LAND COVER BEYOND FOCAL FARMS OR FIELDS, CONTEXTUALISING THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT. THIS STUDY MEASURED THE RESPONSE OF AERIAL INVERTEBRATE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS TO AES MANAGEMENT IN IMPROVED AND SEMI-IMPROVED UPLAND GRASSLANDS ACCOUNTING FOR SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION AND MULTI-SCALE EFFECTS OF LAND COVER WITHIN BUFFERS VARYING FROM 100 M TO 5 KM AT 88 PAIRED FIELDS.

EXPANDING CROPLANDS AND INTENSIFYING GRAZING PRESSURES ARE POPULARLY HYPOTHESIZED TO BE THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN THE REGION. OUR STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CONTEMPORARY LAND-USE CHANGE ON BIRD COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN THAR DESERT. 2. WE SURVEYED 59 RANDOMLY LAID LINE TRANSECTS IN A ~2000 SQ.KM STUDY AREA, TO QUANTIFY PARAMETERS OF BIRD COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN THREE PREDOMINANT LAND-COVER TYPES VIZ. PROTECTED GRASSLANDS, RANGELANDS, AND FALLOW CROPLANDS. FIELDWORK FOR THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE DRY SEASON (WINTER AND SUMMER) BETWEEN DECEMBER 2018 AND APRIL 2019. 3. DURING WINTER, OVERALL BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WAS HIGHEST IN PROTECTED GRASSLANDS FOLLOWED BY FALLOW CROPLANDS AND RANGELANDS. PROTECTED GRASSLANDS ALSO HAD A HIGHER ABUNDANCE OF DIET AND HABITAT SPECIALISTS. COMPARED TO PROTECTED GRASSLANDS, DENSITY WAS LOWER IN FALLOW CROPLANDS AND RANGELANDS FOR 35% AND 10% OF SPECIES, RESPECTIVELY. A MAJORITY OF THE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED SPECIES WERE INSECTIVOROUS GRASSLAND SPECIALISTS. 4. CONTRARY TO THE PATTERN IN WINTER, OVERALL BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE, COMPOSITION, AND GUILD STRUCTURE IN SUMMER WAS SIMILAR ACROSS THE THREE LAND-USE TYPES. ONLY ONE OF THE 17 ANALYSED SPECIES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER DENSITY IN MODIFIED LAND-USE TYPES. 5. OVERALL, PROTECTED GRASSLANDS WERE THE BEST HABITAT FOR BIRDS AND SPECIFICALLY IMPORTANT FOR DIET AND HABITAT SPECIALISTS, MORE SO DURING THE WINTER. RANGELANDS AND FALLOW CROPLANDS SUSTAINED MOST GENERALISTS AT COMPARABLE DENSITIES BUT HAD SEVERE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON SPECIALIST SPECIES. 6. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATION: OUR RESULTS POINT OUT THAT LOW-INTENSITY AGRO-PASTORAL LAND-USES CAN SUPPLEMENT, BUT NOT REPLACE, PROTECTED AREAS IN CONSERVATION OF THAR DESERT'S AVIFAUNAL DIVERSITY.

MOST STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON ENTIRE CLADES, WHILE APPROACHES TESTING FOR SELECTIVE EXTINCTION RISK WITH RESPECT TO ECOLOGICAL TRAITS ARE RARE. AS STUDIES ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON MODERN FAUNAS, THE GENERALITY OF THE DETECTED PATTERNS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT BIODIVERSITY CRISIS REMAINS UNCERTAIN. WE USE A DATASET OF FOSSIL AND MODERN FRESHWATER GASTROPODS TO INVESTIGATE EXTINCTION PROBABILITY IN DEPENDENCE OF LIFESTYLE AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION. LOCATION: EUROPE, MIOCENE TO PRESENT-DAY. METHODS: WE PERFORMED GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELLING TO TEST FOR A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXTINCTION PROBABILITY AND TAXONOMIC GROUP (CAENOGASTROPODA VS. HYGROPHILA, REFLECTING DIFFERENT LIFESTYLES) AND RANGE SIZE, WHILE USING TIME AS RANDOM EFFECT. EXTINCTION AND SURVIVAL OF MODERN REPRESENTATIVES WAS PREDICTED BASED ON IUCN CONSERVATION STATUS. TO IDENTIFY THE TYPES OF FAUNAS WITH ELEVATED EXTINCTION RISK WITH RESPECT TO LIFESTYLE, WE TESTED FOR A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PROPORTION OF CAENOGASTROPODA AND LAKE SURFACE AREA AND GEOLOGICAL DURATION USING GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS. RESULTS: WE FOUND A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXTINCTION LIKELIHOOD AND LIFESTYLE, WHICH IS LINKED TO DIFFERENCES IN RANGE SIZES AND IS INDEPENDENT OF GEOLOGICAL TIME. CAENOGASTROPODA ARE MORE PRONE TO GO EXTINCT. A STRONG POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PROPORTION OF CAENOGASTROPODA AND GEOLOGICAL DURATION WAS FOUND, SHOWING THAT CAENOGASTROPODA ARE MORE DOMINANT IN LONG-LIVED LAKES. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: THE ELEVATED EXTINCTION RISK OF CAENOGASTROPODS IS LINKED TO THEIR SMALLER GEOGRAPHIC RANGES, WHICH REFLECTS THEIR COMPARABLY POOR COLONIZATION ABILITY, AND URGES ENHANCED CONSERVATION EFFORTS. THEIR HIGH DIVERSITY AND HIGH DEGREE OF ENDEMISM IN LONG-LIVED LAKES RENDER, ESPECIALLY THESE ARCHIVES OF EVOLUTION IMPORTANT CONSERVATORS OF BIODIVERSITY.

THIS DIVERSITY IS IN DECLINE DUE TO LAND USE INTENSIFICATION AND ABANDONMENT. NATURAL AND SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS OF THE CARPATHIAN LOWLANDS HAVE BECOME ENDANGERED OVER THE 19TH CENTURY. HOWEVER, SOME REMAINS OF FORMER WETLANDS HAVE SURVIVED LAND USE CHANGE IN THE BEREG REGION (NORTH-EASTERN HUNGARY AND EASTERN UKRAINE). WE SURVEYED ORTHOPTERANS AS SENSITIVE INDICATORS OF HABITAT STRUCTURE AND MICROCLIMATE IN GRASSLANDS. WE IDENTIFIED THREE DIFFERENT ORTHOPTERA ASSEMBLAGES AND THEIR CHARACTER SPECIES. ALTHOUGH RARE AND ESPECIALLY VALUABLE SPECIES WERE NOT FOUND IN THE STUDIED SITES, THE SPECIES RICH REMAINS OF WETLANDS STILL PROTECTED RELICS OF FORMER WILDLIFE OF WETLANDS.

CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO DISENTANGLING THE CAUSES AND SELECTIVITY OF THE ETE, WHILST DOWNPLAYING THE PATTERNS OF CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONING OF MARINE PALEOFAUNA. HERE WE PROVIDE DETAILED QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FROM ACROSS THE TRIASSIC-JURASSIC BOUNDARY AT WATERLOO BAY, LARNE, NORTHERN IRELAND, TO DESCRIBE PATTERNS OF CHANGES IN DIFFERENT PALAEOECOLOGICAL PARAMETERS ACROSS THE ETE. THE ANALYSIS WAS BASED ON ABUNDANCE DATA OF SPECIES SAMPLED FROM APPROXIMATELY 1 M INTERVALS THROUGH THE SEQUENCE. DOMINANCE AND RICHNESS WERE ESTIMATED USING RAREFACTION TECHNIQUES AND Β-DIVERSITY INDEX, AND DISTINCTNESS DIVERSITY INDICES WERE CALCULATED. CHANGES IN SPECIES COMPOSITION WERE EVALUATED BY MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS (NMDS, ANOMSIM AND SIMPER). RANK ABUNDANCE MODELS WERE FITTED, AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY WERE ESTIMATED BASED ON AN ECOSPACE MODEL, APPLIED TO EACH SAMPLED UNIT TO DETECT CHANGES IN STRUCTURE AND ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY. ACROSS THE ETE THREE DISTINCTIVE STATES WERE IDENTIFIED: THE PRE-EXTINCTION STATE (WESTBURY FORMATION), CHARACTERISED BY AN ASSEMBLAGE WITH HIGH SPECIES RICHNESS AND ECOLOGICAL REDUNDANCY, AND WITH LOW TAXONOMIC VARIATION AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY.

BY TRANSCENDING THE TRADITIONAL DISCIPLINARY BOUNDARIES, CONSERVATIONISTS CAN REACH NEW AUDIENCES TO COMMUNICATE PRO-CONSERVATION KNOWLEDGE, EDUCATION AND AWARENESS MESSAGES. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 2.7 BILLION VIDEO-GAMERS WORLDWIDE, WITH MILLIONS MORE JOINING AS A RESULT OF GLOBAL LOCKDOWNS. IN MARCH 2020, ANIMAL CROSSING: NEW HORIZONS WAS RELEASED BY NINTENDO, FAST BECOMING THE SECOND-BEST SELLING VIDEO GAME EVER IN JAPAN, AND SELLING OVER 26.4 MILLION UNITS WORLDWIDE. UNLIKE MANY POPULAR VIDEO GAMES, ITS UNIQUE PREMISE INVOLVES PLAYERS CREATING AN ISLAND, GROWING VEGETATION, CATCHING WILDLIFE AND DONATING FOSSILS AND SPECIES TO A MUSEUM. THE GAME HAS BEEN PRAISED FOR ITS POSITIVITY, ESCAPISM AND MEASURABLE BENEFITS TO MENTAL WELL-BEING. HERE, WE ARTICULATE HOW DIFFERENT FEATURES OF THE GAME, INCLUDING THE ISLANDS, THEIR BIODIVERSITY AND INHABITANTS, ENCOURAGE PLAYERS TO EXHIBIT PRO-CONSERVATION BEHAVIOURS AND ATTITUDES (E.G. RECYCLING LITTER, OR PLANTING A DIVERSITY OF FLOWERS), AS WELL AS IMPROVING PLAYERS’ KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF RELATIVELY LITTLE KNOWN TAXA (MARINE AND FRESHWATER FISHES AND INVERTEBRATES). WE ALSO HIGHLIGHT WHERE PITFALLS EXIST (E.G. ENCOURAGING THE COLLECTION OF THREATENED SPECIES). WE PRINCIPALLY FRAME THESE DISCUSSIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF JAPAN'S CULTURAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NATURAL WORLD, INCLUDING ITS HISTORY OF INSECT-COLLECTING AND ITS MANAGEMENT OF GREEN SPACES. WE CONCLUDE BY OUTLINING SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS TO FUTURE RELEASES, OR FOR SIMILAR GAMES, THAT COULD FURTHER PROMOTE CONSERVATION MESSAGING. THIS PERSPECTIVE SHEDS LIGHT ON THE AVENUES THROUGH WHICH ANIMAL CROSSING: NEW HORIZONS ENCOURAGES PRO-CONSERVATION KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOURS OF ITS INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE, WITH POTENTIAL FOR THESE EXPERIENCES TO TRANSLATE INTO REAL-WORLD CONSERVATION ACTIONS.

ECOL. EVOL.,1,"BACKGROUND: BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS (BD) IS THE CAUSATIVE AGENT OF CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS, ONE OF THE MAJOR CAUSES OF WORLDWIDE AMPHIBIAN BIODIVERSITY LOSS. MANY AMPHIBIANS EXHIBIT SKIN-BASED CHEMICAL DEFENCES, WHICH MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE AGAINST INVADING PATHOGENS, BUT WHETHER THE SYNTHESIS OF THESE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS IS ENHANCED OR SUPPRESSED IN THE PRESENCE OF PATHOGENS IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. HERE WE INVESTIGATED DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF LARVAL EXPOSURE TO THE GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED AND HIGHLY VIRULENT BD-GPL STRAIN ON SKIN SECRETED CHEMICAL DEFENCES AND LIFE HISTORY TRAITS DURING EARLY ONTOGENY OF AGILE FROGS (RANA DALMATINA) AND COMMON TOADS (BUFO BUFO). RESULTS: EXPOSURE TO BD DURING THE LARVAL STAGE DID NOT RESULT IN ENHANCED SYNTHESIS OF THE ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE BREVININ-1 DA IN R. DALMATINA TADPOLES OR IN INCREASED PRODUCTION OF BUFADIENOLIDES IN B. BUFO TADPOLES. HOWEVER, EXPOSURE TO BD DURING THE LARVAL STAGE HAD A CARRY-OVER EFFECT REACHING BEYOND METAMORPHOSIS: BOTH R. DALMATINA AND B. BUFO FROGLETS CONTAINED SMALLER QUANTITIES OF DEFENSIVE CHEMICALS THAN THEIR BD-NAÏVE CONSPECIFICS IN THE CONTROL TREATMENT. PREVALENCE OF BD AND INFECTION INTENSITIES WERE VERY LOW IN BOTH LARVAE AND METAMORPHS OF R. DALMATINA, WHILE IN B. BUFO WE OBSERVED HIGH BD PREVALENCE AND INFECTION INTENSITIES, ESPECIALLY IN METAMORPHS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE DID NOT FIND A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF BD-EXPOSURE ON BODY MASS OR DEVELOPMENT RATE IN LARVAE OR METAMORPHS IN EITHER SPECIES. CONCLUSIONS: THE LACK OF DETRIMENTAL EFFECT OF BD-EXPOSURE ON LIFE HISTORY TRAITS, EVEN PARALLEL WITH HIGH INFECTION INTENSITIES IN THE CASE OF B. BUFO INDIVIDUALS, IS SURPRISING AND SUGGESTS HIGH TOLERANCE OF LOCAL POPULATIONS OF THESE TWO SPECIES AGAINST BD.

HOWEVER, RELATED DEBATES IN CONSERVATION, SUCH AS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT, OFTEN OVERLOOK THE DETAILS WITHIN NATIONAL LEGISLATION THAT DEFINE WHICH SPECIFIC ACTS ARE ILLEGAL, THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH LAWS APPLY, AND HOW THEY ARE SANCTIONED. BASED ON A REVIEW OF 90 WILDLIFE LAWS IN 8 HIGH-BIODIVERSITY COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT LEGAL SYSTEMS, WE DEVELOPED A TAXONOMY THAT DESCRIBES ALL TYPES OF WILDLIFE OFFENSES IN THOSE COUNTRIES. THE 511 OFFENSES ARE ORGANIZED INTO A HIERARCHICAL TAXONOMY THAT SCHOLARS AND PRACTITIONERS CAN USE TO HELP CONDUCT LEGAL ANALYSES. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT AMIDST COMPETING CALLS TO STRENGTHEN, DEREGULATE, AND REFORM WILDLIFE LEGISLATION, PARTICULARLY IN RESPONSE TO FEARS OVER ZOONOTIC THREATS AND LARGE-SCALE BIODIVERSITY LOSS. IT CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE MORE NUANCE LEGAL ANALYSES AND FACILITATE LIKE-FOR-LIKE COMPARISONS ACROSS COUNTRIES, INFORMING PROCESSES TO REDRAFT CONSERVATION LAWS, REVIEW DEREGULATION EFFORTS, CLOSE LOOPHOLES, AND HARMONIZE LEGISLATION ACROSS JURISDICTIONS. WE APPLIED THE TAXONOMY IN A COMPARISON OF SANCTIONS IN 8 COUNTRIES FOR HUNTING A PROTECTED SPECIES. WE FOUND NOT ONLY HUGE RANGES IN FINES (US$0 TO $200,000) AND IMPRISONMENT TERMS (1.5 YEARS TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT), BUT ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO DESIGNING SANCTIONS FOR WILDLIFE OFFENSES.

THE RICHNESS OF TAXONOMIC GROUPS WAS RATHER INSENSITIVE TO MANAGEMENT INTENSITY, CARBON STOCKS AND FOREST PRODUCTIVITY. DESPITE THE LOW EXPLANATORY POWER OF THE MAIN PREDICTOR VARIABLES, FOREST MANAGEMENT HAD THE GREATEST RELATIVE INFLUENCE ON RICHNESS OF INSECTS AND TREE-RELATED MICROHABITATS, WHILE CARBON STOCKS INFLUENCED RICHNESS OF BATS, BIRDS, VASCULAR PLANTS AND POOLED TAXA. SPECIES COMPOSITION CHANGED RELATIVELY ABRUPTLY ALONG THE MANAGEMENT INTENSITY GRADIENT, WHILE CHANGES ALONG CARBON AND PRODUCTIVITY GRADIENTS WERE MORE GRADUAL.

FIRE FREQUENCY (I.E., TEMPORAL SCALE) IS LIKELY THE MOST STUDIED FIRE REGIME ATTRIBUTE AS IT RELATES TO CONSERVATION OF FIRE-ADAPTED ECOSYSTEMS. GENERALLY, RESEARCH CONVERGES ON FIRE FREQUENCY AS THE PRIMARY FILTER IN PLANT COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY AND STRUCTURE, WHICH IS OFTEN CRITICAL TO CONSERVATION GOALS. THUS, CONSERVATION SUCCESS IS COMMONLY LINKED TO FIRE FREQUENCY IN FIRE REGIMES. THE SPATIAL SCALE OF FIRE MAY ALSO BE VITAL TO CONSERVATION OUTCOMES, BUT THIS ATTRIBUTE IS UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE PRIMARY LITERATURE. IN OUR GLOBAL, CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE SEARCH, WE FOUND 37 PUBLISHED SYNTHESES CONCERNING THE EFFECTS OF PRESCRIBED FIRE IN CONSERVATION OVER THE LAST DECADE. IN THOSE SYNTHESES, ONLY 16% INCLUDED STUDIES THAT REPORTED DATA-BASED INFERENCES RELATED TO THE SPATIAL SCALE OF THE FIRE, WHEREAS 73% INCLUDED DISCUSSION OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES ON THE TEMPORAL SCALE. ONLY ONE OF THE SYNTHESES DISCUSSED STUDIES THAT EXPLICITLY TESTED THE EFFECTS OF SPATIAL EXTENT, AND NONE OF THOSE STUDIES WERE EXPERIMENTS MANIPULATING SPATIAL SCALE. FURTHER, UNDERSTANDING SPATIAL-SCALE-DEPENDENT PATTERNS MAY BE RELEVANT BECAUSE TWO DATABASES OF FIRE-OCCURRENCE DATA FROM THE UNITED STATES INDICATED THAT SPATIAL SCALE AMONG LIGHTNING-IGNITED AND PRESCRIBED FIRES MAY HAVE BEEN MISMATCHED OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES. BASED ON A RICH ECOLOGICAL LITERATURE BASE THAT DEMONSTRATES PERVASIVE SCALE-DEPENDENT EFFECTS IN ECOLOGY, SPATIAL-SCALE-DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PRESCRIBED FIRE REGIMES AND CONSERVATION OUTCOMES ARE LIKELY. USING EXAMPLES FROM THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES, WE EXPLORED THE POTENTIAL FOR SCALE-DEPENDENT ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF FIRE.

SINCE THE LAST TWO DECADES, THE HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED MAMMAL FAUNA FOUND FROM THIS CAVE HAS BEEN WIDELY USED AS STANDARD REFERENCES FOR SEVERAL STUDIES, THOUGH THE MAJORITY OF FOSSIL PRIMATES, CARNIVORES, AND UNGULATES HAVE NEVER BEEN DESCRIBED IN DETAIL. THIS PAPER PRESENTS TAXONOMIC DESCRIPTIONS OF UNPUBLISHED FOSSIL SPECIMENS FROM THE LONG-KNOWN COLLECTION OF THAM WIMAN NAKIN. AS A RESULT, THE FAUNA OF THAM WIMAN NAKIN CONSISTED OF AT LEAST 28 LARGE MAMMAL TAXA. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED SPECIMENS ARE RE-ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENT TOOTH ELEMENTS AND/OR MAMMAL TAXA, OUR TAXONOMIC STUDY CONFIRMS THE EXISTENCE OF MOST OF THE SPECIES IDENTIFIED FROM THE PREVIOUS WORK AND DESCRIBES THREE ADDITIONAL TAXA FOR THE LOCALITY: AN ASIAN BADGER, A TIGER, AND A HIMALAYAN GORAL. THE THAM WIMAN NAKIN FAUNA IS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE PLEISTOCENE MAMMALS, INCLUDING A HOMININ, IN MAINLAND SOUTHEAST ASIA AND DOCUMENTS LONG-TERM SURVIVORS OF LIVING SPECIES SINCE THE LATE MIDDLE PLEISTOCENE. BASED ON SEVERAL RECENT DATES OF FOSSIL SITES IN MAINLAND SOUTHEAST ASIA, BIOCHRONOLOGICAL DATA IMPLY A POSSIBLE FAUNAL AGE UP TO THE MAXIMUM OF 300 KA FOR THE THAM WIMAN NAKIN FAUNA, BUT YOUNGER THAN THAT OF PHA BONG WHERE GIGANTOPITHECUS WAS PRESENT. FOSSIL RECORDS IN THE REGION ALSO SUGGEST A RELATIVELY STABLE FAUNA THROUGH PLEISTOCENE GLACIAL-INTERGLACIAL CYCLES, AT LEAST FROM THE LATE MIDDLE TO LATEST PLEISTOCENE. THE EXTINCTION OCCURRING IN THE MAINLAND VARIED ACROSS TAXA AND LIKELY RESULTED IN LESS IMPACTED BIODIVERSITY LOSS PRIOR TO THE HOLOCENE, COMPARED TO OTHER CONTINENTS, AS INDICATED BY THE SMALL PROPORTION OF SPECIES BECOMING EXTINCT DURING EACH INTERVAL.

WITHIN CAMBODIA, THE USE OF WIRE SNARES TO CAPTURE WILDLIFE IS A SEVERE THREAT IN PROTECTED AREAS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN FEW STUDIES OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF HUNTERS FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES. HERE, WE COMBINE THE UNMATCHED COUNT TECHNIQUE WITH DIRECT QUESTIONING TO ESTIMATE THE PREVALENCE OF HUNTING BEHAVIOURS AND WILDLIFE CONSUMPTION AMONGST 705 HOUSEHOLDS LIVING WITHIN KEO SEIMA WILDLIFE SANCTUARY, CAMBODIA. WE ASSESSED RESPONDENTS' KNOWLEDGE OF RULES, AND THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF PATROLS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING RULES. ESTIMATES OF HUNTING BEHAVIOUR WERE VARIABLE: RESULTS FROM THE UNMATCHED COUNT TECHNIQUE WERE INCONCLUSIVE, AND DIRECT QUESTIONING REVEALED 9% OF HOUSEHOLDS HUNTED, AND 20% SET SNARES AROUND FARMS TO PREVENT WILDLIFE EATING CROPS. HUNTING WITH DOMESTIC DOGS WAS THE METHOD MOST COMMONLY USED TO CATCH WILDLIFE (87% OF HOUSEHOLDS OWNED DOGS). WILD MEAT WAS CONSUMED BY 84% OF HOUSEHOLDS, AND WAS MOST FREQUENTLY BOUGHT OR CAUGHT, BUT ALSO GIFTED. WE DETECTED A HIGH AWARENESS OF CONSERVATION RULES, BUT LOW AWARENESS OF PUNISHMENTS AND PENALTIES, WITH WILDLIFE DEPLETION, RATHER THAN THE RISK OF BEING CAUGHT BY PATROLS, CAUSING THE GREATEST REDUCTION IN HUNTING.

ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION STANDS AS A SOLUTION TO REVERT SUCH EFFECTS. CONCOMITANTLY, AWARENESS IS CURRENTLY BEING GIVEN ON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES TO EVALUATE RESTORATION EFFICIENCY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS RESTORATION SUCCESS IN A QUARRY SUBJECTED TO RESTORATION PRACTICES FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS INVOLVING THE PLANTATION OF NATIVE MEDITERRANEAN VEGETATION AND THE NON-NATIVE ALEPPO PINE PINUS HALEPENSIS. THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT BY ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SEED DISPERSAL SERVICE PROVIDED BY BIRDS IN THE RESTORED QUARRY BY COMPARING THIS SERVICE TO NEIGHBOURING NATURAL (SHRUBLAND) AND OTHER SEMI-NATURAL AREAS (OAK-PINE MIXED OPEN AND ALEPPO PINE FOREST) PRESENT AT THE LANDSCAPE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE EXPLORED BIRD COMPOSITION STRUCTURE AND SEED DISPERSAL NETWORKS USING POINT COUNTS AND FAECAL SAMPLES OF MIST-NETTED BIRDS. WE ALSO COLLECTED VEGETATION STRUCTURE DATA AND EXPLORED ITS EFFECT ON BIRD COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT BIRD ABUNDANCE IN THE RESTORED QUARRY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER, AND ITS BIRD COMMUNITY WAS COMPOSITIONALLY DIFFERENT THAN NATURAL SHRUBLAND AND SEMI-NATURAL AREAS. FOR INSTANCE, SEED-DISPERSING BIRDS, WOODY AND SHRUB/GROUND FORAGERS AND PARTIALLY MIGRATORS WERE THE MOST AFFECTED GROUPS AT THE RESTORED AREA. BIRD COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND THEIR TRAITS WERE LIKELY DRIVEN BY VEGETATION CHARACTERISTICS, WITH HIGHER NATIVE VEGETATION COVER AND FRUIT RICHNESS PROMOTING HIGHER BIRD ABUNDANCE AND ALEPPO PINE COVER NEGATIVELY INFLUENCING SEED-DISPERSING BIRDS. CONCURRENTLY, SEED DISPERSAL NETWORK IN THE RESTORED QUARRY WAS LESS COMPLEX THAN IN OTHER AREAS. SEED DISPERSAL SERVICES IN THE RESTORED QUARRY WERE BELOW THE REPORTED VALUES FOR NEIGHBOURING NATURAL AND SEMI-NATURAL AREAS AND ARE LIKELY DRIVEN BY THE LOW ABUNDANCE OF SEED-DISPERSING BIRDS. WE CONSIDER THAT THE CAUSES AFFECTING THIS GROUP'S LOW ABUNDANCE CAN BE RELATED TO REVEGETATION MEASURES FAVOURING ALEPPO PINE, COMBINED WITH A SHALLOW SOIL DEPTH AND POOR SOIL QUALITY, WHICH MAY HAVE CONSTRAINED NATIVE VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT. WE CONCLUDE THAT SEED DISPERSAL SERVICES AT THE QUARRY ARE DEPLETED, WHICH MAY SUGGEST A LOW RESTORATION SUCCESS CONCERNING ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING. OUR RESULTS STRENGTHEN THAT QUARRY REVEGETATION WITH NON-NATIVE SPECIES MUST BE AVOIDED, SINCE IT ALTERS BIRD COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, AND CONSEQUENTLY, AFFECTS SEED DISPERSAL SERVICE PROVIDED BY BIRDS. © 2021 ELSEVIER LTD",113472,NA,JEVMA,"SAMPAIO, A.D.; UBC, PÓLO DA MITRA, AP. 94, PORTUGAL; EMAIL: ANADSAMPAIO@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113472,NA,3014797,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,ACADEMIC PRESS,34365186,SCOPUS,BOTTOM-UP CASCADING EFFECTS OF QUARRY REVEGETATION DEPLETE BIRD-MEDIATED SEED DISPERSAL SERVICES,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111920924&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2021.113472&partnerID=40&md5=549c32328471861a82aeb4c398be2222,298,2021,"WE ACKNOWLEDGE SECIL-OUTÃO FOR FUNDING THIS STUDY AND GRANTING ACCESS TO THE QUARRY, CAROLINA CARVALHO FOR THE HELP PROVIDED DURING FIELDWORK, ALEXANDRA SILVA FOR LOGISTICAL SUPPORT, AND LABOR - LABORATORY OF ORNITHOLOGY (MED) FOR THE SUPPORT ON BIRD TRAPPING MATERIAL AND DISCUSSION OF THE MANUSCRIPT.

IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED MULTI-SCALE HABITAT SELECTION FOR OHIO’S EXPANDING BOBCAT POPULATION, AND EXAMINED HABITAT CONNECTIVITY IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE CONDUITS FOR DISPERSAL STATEWIDE. WE USED CITIZEN OBSERVATIONS COLLECTED BETWEEN 1978 AND 2019 AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO EVALUATE POPULATION-LEVEL HABITAT SELECTION, AND GPS TELEMETRY DATA FOR 20 INDIVIDUALS COLLECTED BETWEEN 2012 AND 2014 AND A DISTRIBUTION-WEIGHTED EXPONENTIAL RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTION TO EVALUATE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL HABITAT SELECTION WITHIN HOME RANGES. AT THE POPULATION LEVEL, BOBCATS SELECTED FOR HIGHER AMOUNTS OF FOREST AND PASTURE (AT A 50 KM2 SCALE) AND HERBACEOUS VEGETATION (AT 15–50 50 KM2 SCALES), THUS OVERALL HETEROGENEOUS FORESTED HABITAT. AT INDIVIDUAL (HOME RANGE) LEVEL, BOBCATS SELECTED FOR FORESTED HABITATS WITH LOW ROAD DENSITY AND FARTHER AWAY FROM HIGH TRAFFIC ROADS; THEY ALSO SHOWED WEAK SELECTION FOR OPEN HABITAT AT THE HOME RANGE LEVEL. MALE HOME RANGES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN FEMALE HOME RANGES. LASTLY, WE USED THE POPULATION-LEVEL SPATIAL OUTPUTS (I.E. HABITAT SUITABILITY MAP) TO PARAMETERIZE HABITAT CONNECTIVITY MODELS USING CIRCUIT THEORY IN THE PROGRAM CIRCUITSCAPE. WE TESTED THREE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HABITAT SUITABILITY AND RESISTANCE TO MOVEMENT AND USED A SUBSET OF DATA ON POTENTIAL DISPERSING INDIVIDUALS TO EVALUATE WHICH RELATIONSHIP PERFORMED BEST. ALL THREE RELATIONSHIPS PERFORMED ALMOST EQUALLY WELL, AND WE CALCULATED A WEIGHTED AVERAGED CONNECTIVITY MAP AS OUR FINAL MAP. HABITAT WAS HIGHLY PERMEABLE TO MOVEMENTS BETWEEN CORE AREAS OF TWO GENETICALLY DISTINCT SUBPOPULATIONS LOCATED IN SOUTHEASTERN OHIO. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL DISPERSAL CORRIDORS FROM THE CORE AREAS TO OTHER REGIONS OF OHIO DOMINATED BY AGRICULTURE AND SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT VIA FORESTED RIPARIAN CORRIDORS.

BIOL.,1,"THE SCALE AND DRIVERS OF MARINE BIODIVERSITY LOSS ARE BEING REVEALED BY THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE (IUCN) RED LIST ASSESSMENT PROCESS. WE PRESENT THE FIRST GLOBAL REASSESSMENT OF 1,199 SPECIES IN CLASS CHONDRICHTHYES—SHARKS, RAYS, AND CHIMERAS. THE FIRST GLOBAL ASSESSMENT (IN 2014) CONCLUDED THAT ONE-QUARTER (24%) OF SPECIES WERE THREATENED. NOW, 391 (32.6%) SPECIES ARE THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION. WHEN THIS PERCENTAGE OF THREAT IS APPLIED TO DATA DEFICIENT SPECIES, MORE THAN ONE-THIRD (37.5%) OF CHONDRICHTHYANS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE THREATENED, WITH MUCH OF THIS CHANGE RESULTING FROM NEW INFORMATION. THREE SPECIES ARE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED (POSSIBLY EXTINCT), REPRESENTING POSSIBLY THE FIRST GLOBAL MARINE FISH EXTINCTIONS DUE TO OVERFISHING. CONSEQUENTLY, THE CHONDRICHTHYAN EXTINCTION RATE IS POTENTIALLY 25 EXTINCTIONS PER MILLION SPECIES YEARS, COMPARABLE TO THAT OF TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES. OVERFISHING IS THE UNIVERSAL THREAT AFFECTING ALL 391 THREATENED SPECIES AND IS THE SOLE THREAT FOR 67.3% OF SPECIES AND INTERACTS WITH THREE OTHER THREATS FOR THE REMAINING THIRD: LOSS AND DEGRADATION OF HABITAT (31.2% OF THREATENED SPECIES), CLIMATE CHANGE (10.2%), AND POLLUTION (6.9%). SPECIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY THREATENED IN TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL COASTAL WATERS. SCIENCE-BASED LIMITS ON FISHING, EFFECTIVE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS, AND APPROACHES THAT REDUCE OR ELIMINATE FISHING MORTALITY ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO MINIMIZE MORTALITY OF THREATENED SPECIES AND ENSURE SUSTAINABLE CATCH AND TRADE OF OTHERS.

THE IUCN WORLD COMMISSION ON PROTECTED AREAS, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH UNEP – WORLD CONSERVATION MONITORING CENTRE, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY AND BIRDLIFE INTERNATIONAL HAS PUBLISHED GUIDANCE ENTITLED ‘CONSERVING AT LEAST 30% OF THE PLANET BY 2030: WHAT SHOULD COUNT?’. THIS GUIDANCE CALLS FOR A FOCUS ON QUALITY AS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF LARGE AREA-BASED CONSERVATION TARGETS. QUALITY INCLUDES MANY ELEMENTS, INCLUDING A FOCUS ON ESTABLISHING PROTECTED AND CONSERVED AREAS IN AREAS IMPORTANT FOR BIODIVERSITY, HOW THEY ARE DESIGNED AND ECOLOGICALLY CONNECTED, AND ENSURING MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND GOVERNANCE EQUITY. BUT PROTECTED AND CONSERVED AREAS MUST BE REALISED IN FULL PARTNERSHIP WITH INDIGENOUS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

PBFD IS CAUSED BY THE BEAK AND FEATHER DISEASE VIRUS (BFDV), WHICH BELONGS TO THE CIRCOVIRIDAE FAMILY AND COMPRISES A CIRCULAR, SINGLE-STRANDED DNA GENOME. BFDV IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE SPREAD RAPIDLY ACROSS THE WORLD AND, IN 2005, AN OUTBREAK OF PBFD WAS DOCUMENTED IN THE RECOVERING POPULATION OF THE MAURITIUS PARAKEET (ALEXANDRINUS EQUES).

LARGE HERBIVORES REGULATE MANY ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES AND FUNCTIONS; YET, THEIR POTENTIAL AS A NATURE-BASED SOLUTION TO BUFFER AGAINST LONG-TERM TEMPORAL DECLINES IN BIODIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL CHANGE AND RESTORE DIVERSITY IN SECONDARY FORESTS REMAINS UNKNOWN. BY MEANS OF AN EXCLUSION EXPERIMENT, WE TESTED EXPERIMENTALLY THE BUFFERING EFFECTS OF LARGE WILD HERBIVORES TO AVERT AGAINST LONG-TERM BIODIVERSITY COLLAPSE IN OLD-GROWTH AND SECONDARY TROPICAL FORESTS IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST OF BRAZIL WHERE SAPLING ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS DECLINED C. 20% OVER THE COURSE OF 10 YEARS. THE EXPERIMENT COMPRISED 50 LARGE HERBIVORE EXCLOSURE-OPEN CONTROL PLOT PAIRS (25 AT THE OLD-GROWTH FOREST AND 25 AT THE SECONDARY FOREST), WHERE 2 M2 WERE MONITORED IN EVERY PLOT DURING A 10-YEAR PERIOD. LARGE HERBIVORES WERE ABLE TO DECELERATE DIVERSITY DECLINES AND COMPOSITIONAL CHANGE IN THE SPECIES-RICH OLD-GROWTH FOREST, BUT ONLY DECELERATED COMPOSITIONAL CHANGE IN THE SECONDARY FOREST. IN CONTRAST, DECLINES IN SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WERE UNAFFECTED BY LARGE HERBIVORES ON EITHER FOREST. THE BUFFERING EFFECTS OF LARGE HERBIVORES WERE STRONGLY NONLINEAR AND CONTINGENT ON THE INITIAL LEVEL OF DIVERSITY AT THE PATCH SCALE: HIGHLY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES SUFFERED THE STRONGEST COLLAPSE IN THE ABSENCE OF LARGE HERBIVORES. THUS, LARGER BUFFERING EFFECTS OF LARGE HERBIVORES ON THE OLD-GROWTH FOREST ARE THE LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF LARGE HERBIVORES BUFFERING THE MANY HIGH DIVERSITY PLANT COMMUNITIES FOUND IN THIS FOREST. CONVERSELY, AS THE SECONDARY FOREST HELD FEWER HIGH DIVERSITY PATCHES, BUFFERING EFFECTS ON THE SECONDARY FOREST WERE WEAK. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR STUDY INDICATES THAT LARGE HERBIVORES HAVE MODERATE YET CRITICAL EFFECTS ON SLOWING DOWN COMMUNITY CHANGE AND DIVERSITY LOSS OF HIGHLY DIVERSE PLANT COMMUNITIES, THUS SUGGESTING THAT THE CONSERVATION OF (AND POTENTIALLY TROPHIC REWILDING WITH) LARGE HERBIVORES IS A FUNDAMENTAL NATURE-BASED SOLUTION FOR AVERTING THE GLOBAL COLLAPSE OF THE STRONGHOLDS OF BIODIVERSITY.

HOWEVER, THE CURRENT NETWORK OF GRASSLAND CONSERVATION AREAS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE FOR HALTING POPULATION DECLINES AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS. HERE, WE EVALUATE A NETWORK OF GRASSLAND CONSERVATION AREAS WITHIN WISCONSIN, U.S.A., THAT INCLUDES BOTH LARGE FOCAL LANDSCAPES AND SMALLER TARGETED CONSERVATION AREAS (E.G., GRASSLAND BIRD CONSERVATION AREAS, GBCAS) ESTABLISHED WITHIN THEM. TO DATE, THIS CONSERVATION NETWORK HAS LACKED BASELINE INFORMATION TO ASSESS WHETHER THE CURRENT PLACEMENT OF THESE CONSERVATION AREAS ALIGNS WITH POPULATION HOT SPOTS OF GRASSLAND-DEPENDENT TAXA. TO DO SO, WE FITTED DATA FROM THOUSANDS OF AVIAN POINT-COUNT SURVEYS COLLECTED BY CITIZEN SCIENTISTS AS PART OF WISCONSIN'S BREEDING BIRD ATLAS II WITH MULTINOMIAL N-MIXTURE MODELS TO ESTIMATE HABITAT–ABUNDANCE RELATIONSHIPS, DEVELOP SPATIALLY EXPLICIT PREDICTIONS OF ABUNDANCE, AND ESTABLISH ECOLOGICAL BASELINES WITHIN PRIORITY CONSERVATION AREAS FOR A SUITE OF OBLIGATE GRASSLAND SONGBIRDS. NEXT, WE DEVELOPED SPATIAL RANDOMIZATION TESTS TO EVALUATE THE PLACEMENT OF THIS CONSERVATION NETWORK RELATIVE TO RANDOMLY PLACED CONSERVATION NETWORKS. OVERALL, LESS THAN 20% OF SPECIES STATEWIDE POPULATIONS WERE FOUND WITHIN THE CURRENT GRASSLAND CONSERVATION NETWORK. SPATIAL TESTS DEMONSTRATED A HIGH REPRESENTATION OF THIS BIRD ASSEMBLAGE WITHIN THE ENTIRE CONSERVATION NETWORK, BUT WITH A BIAS TOWARD BIRDS ASSOCIATED WITH MODERATELY TALLGRASSES RELATIVE TO THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH SHORTGRASSES OR TALLGRASSES.

HOWEVER, CLIMATE CHANGE REPRESENTS A MAIN BARRIER TO FULLY REALIZING A BE. ENABLING CONDITIONS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF A BE AND INCREASE ITS CLIMATE RESILIENCY MUST BE PROMOTED. ROMANIA HAS HIGH POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EU BE DUE TO ITS GEO-GRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, NAMELY THE PRESENCE OF THE DANUBE DELTA–BLACK SEA MACROSYSTEM, WHICH IS PART OF THE ROMANIAN LOWER DANUBE EUROREGION (RLDE). AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES REPRESENT A SECTOR WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH OF THE BE IN THE RLDE, A SITUATION WHICH IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS FOR BOTH HALTING BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND MAINTAINING THE PROPER CONDITIONS TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE EXISTING MACROSYSTEM. IT IS KNOWN THAT CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSES WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS, ACCENTUATES WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS AND LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY AND INDUCES THE DESTRUCTION OF HABITATS, WHICH EVENTUALLY LEADS TO FISH STOCK DEPLETION. THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEVELOP AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK BASED ON MULTIPLE LINEAR PREDICTIVE AND FORECAST MODELS THAT OFFERS COST‐EFFICIENT TOOLS FOR THE MONITORING AND CONTROL OF WATER QUALITY, FISH STOCK DYNAMICS AND BIODIVERSITY IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITY OF THE BE OF THE RLDE IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE FOLLOWING WATER‐DEPENDENT VARIABLES WERE CONSIDERED: TOTAL NITROGEN (TN); TOTAL PHOSPHORUS (TP); DISSOLVED OXYGEN (DO); PH; WATER TEMPERATURE (WT); AND WATER LEVEL, ALL OF WHICH WERE MEASURED BASED ON A SERIES OF 26 PHYSICOCHEMICAL INDICATORS ASSOCIATED WITH 4 SAMPLING AREAS WITHIN THE RLDE (BRĂILA, GALAȚI, TULCEA AND SULINA COUNTIES). PREDICTIVE MODELS BASED ON FISH SPECIES CATCHES ASSOCIATED WITH THE GALATI COUNTY DANUBE RIVER BASIN SEGMENT AND THE ʺDANUBE DELTA” BIOSPHERE RESERVE ADMINISTRATION TERRITORY WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK TO ESTABLISH AN EFFICIENT TOOL FOR MONITORING FISH STOCK DYNAMICS AND STRUCTURES AS WELL AS IDENTIFY METHODS OF CONTROLLING FISH BIODIVERSITY IN THE RLDE TO ENHANCE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND RESILIENCE OF THE ALREADY‐EXISTING BE AND ITS EXPANSION (BLUE GROWTH) IN THE CONTEXT OF AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT CLIMATE VARIATION. THE STUDY AREA REFLECTS THE INTEGRATED APPROACH OF THE EMERGING BE, FOCUSED ON THE OCEAN, SEAS, LAKES AND RIVERS ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS AGENDA. THE RESULTS EMPHASIZED THE VULNERABILITY OF THE RLDE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, A SITUATION REVEALED BY THE WATER LEVEL, AIR TEMPERATURE AND WATER QUALITY PARAMETER TREND LINES AND FORECAST MODELS. CONSIDERING THE SAMPLING DESIGN APPLIED WITHIN THE RLDE, IT CAN BE STATED THAT THE TULCEA COUNTY DANUBE SECTOR WAS LESS AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE COMPARED WITH THE GALAȚI COUNTY SECTOR AS CONFIRMED BY WATER TN AND TP FORECAST ANALYSIS, WHICH REVEALED HIGHER INCREASING TRENDS IN GALAȚI COMPARED WITH TULCEA. THE FISH STOCK BIODIVERSITY WAS PROVEN TO BE AFFECTED BY GLOBAL WARMING WITHIN THE RLDE, SINCE PEACEFUL SPECIES HAD A HIGHER UPWARD TREND COMPARED WITH PREDATORY SPECIES. WATER LEVEL AND AIR TEMPERATURE FORECASTING ANALYSIS PROVED TO BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MONITORING IN THE STUDY AREA. THE RESULTING ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK CONFIRMED THAT TIME SERIES METHODS COULD BE USED TOGETHER WITH MACHINE LEARNING PREDICTION METHODS TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR SYNERGETIC ABILITIES FOR MONITORING AND PREDICTING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE MARINE LIVING RESOURCES OF THE BE SECTOR WITHIN THE RLDE. THE FORECASTING MODELS DEVELOPED IN THE PRESENT STUDY WERE MEANT TO BE USED AS METHODS OF REVEALING FUTURE INFORMATION, MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR DECISION MAKERS TO ADOPT PROPER MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT OR LIMIT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE BE. THROUGH THE IDENTIFIED INDEPENDENT VARIABLES, PREDICTION MODELS OFFER A SOLUTION FOR MANAGING THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFORMING LESS COST‐DEMANDING AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT MONITORING ACTIVITIES. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

UNDERSTANDING KEY SPECIES DISTRIBUTION TO OPTIMIZE CONSERVATION TARGETS IS BOTH URGENT AND NECESSARY TO REVERSE THE CURRENT BIODIVERSITY CRISIS. HEREIN, WE APPLIED HABITAT SUITABILITY MODELS FOR A KEY NEOTROPICAL FOREST UNGULATE, THE WHITE-LIPPED PECCARY (WLP TAYASSU PECARI), TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE AND LANDSCAPE MODIFICATIONS ON ITS DISTRIBUTION, WHICH HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY REDUCED IN BRAZIL. WE USED 318 PRIMARY RECORDS OF WLP TO DERIVE HABITAT SUITABILITY MAPS ACROSS BRAZIL. OUR MODELS INCLUDED BIOCLIMATIC, TOPOGRAPHIC, LANDSCAPE, AND HUMAN INFLUENCE PREDICTORS IN TWO MODELLING APPROACHES. MODELS INCLUDING ALL CATEGORIES OF PREDICTORS OBTAINED THE HIGHEST PREDICTIVE ABILITY AND SHOWED PREVALENCE OF SUITABLE AREAS IN FORESTED REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY, COVERING 49% OF THE BRAZILIAN TERRITORY. FILTERING OUT SMALL FOREST FRAGMENTS (<2050 HA) REDUCED THE SUITABLE AREA BY 5%, WITH A FURTHER REDUCTION OF 4% THAT WAS CAUSED BY DEFORESTATION UNTIL 2020, THEREFORE UNTIL 2020, THE SPECIES HAS SUFFERED A REDUCTION OF ~60% FROM ITS HISTORICAL RANGE IN BRAZIL. OF THE 40% OF THE BRAZILIAN TERRITORY SUITABLE TO WLP, ONLY 12% IS PROTECTED. IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST, ONLY HALF OF ALL PROTECTED AREAS HAVE SUITABLE HABITAT FOR WLP AND EVEN LESS IN PANTANAL (44%), CERRADO (14%) AND CAATINGA (7%). IN A SECOND MODELLING APPROACH, MAPPING THE AREAS WITH SUITABLE CLIMATE AND THOSE WITH SUITABLE LANDSCAPES SEPARATELY, ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY FOUR CATEGORIES OF CONSERVATION VALUES, AND SHOWED THAT ONLY 17% OF THE BRAZILIAN TERRITORY HAS BOTH HIGH LANDSCAPE AND CLIMATIC SUITABILITY FOR WLP. OUR MODELS CAN HELP INFORM COMPLEMENTARY CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS THAT COULD BE ESSENTIAL IN SLOWING DOWN AND POSSIBLY REVERSING CURRENT TRENDS OF POPULATION AND GEOGRAPHIC RANGE REDUCTIONS FOR THE SPECIES, THEREBY AVERTING A POSSIBLE FUTURE COLLAPSE OF FOREST ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING IN THE NEOTROPICAL REGION. © 2021 THE AUTHORS",E01796,NA,NA,"OSHIMA, J.E.D.F.; LABORATÓRIO DE ECOLOGIA DE MOVIMENTO, BRAZIL; EMAIL: JULIAOSHIMA@YAHOO.COM.BR",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01796,"FUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SÃO PAULOFUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SÃO PAULO, FAPESP, 2013/50421–2, 2014/23132–2, 2016/09957–4, 2017/09676–8 COORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIORCOORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIOR, CAPES CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICO, CNPQ, 161089/2014–3 INSTITUTO CHICO MENDES DE CONSERVAÇÃO DA BIODIVERSIDADEINSTITUTO CHICO MENDES DE CONSERVAÇÃO DA BIODIVERSIDADE, ICMBIO",23519894,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,SETTING PRIORITY CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT REGIONS TO REVERSE RAPID RANGE DECLINE OF A KEY NEOTROPICAL FOREST UNGULATE,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117266002&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2021.e01796&partnerID=40&md5=ebe07c18d2c02b64c56a32d1567a2599,31,2021,"THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY COORDINATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION PERSONNEL (CAPES) AGREEMENT WITH SÃO PAULO RESEARCH FOUNDATION (FAPESP) FOR GRANTS (2014/23132–2, 2016/09957–4, 2013/50421–2, AND 2017/09676–8) AND NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (CNPQ GRANT: 161089/2014–3).

WE ARGUE THAT CANCERS SHOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL KEY FOCUS IN THE ONE HEALTH APPROACH BASED ON THREE FACTORS THAT ADD TO THE WELL-DOCUMENTED IMPACT OF HUMANS ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ON CANCER EMERGENCE. FIRST, HUMAN ACTIVITIES ARE ONCOGENIC TO OTHER ANIMALS, EXACERBATING THE DYNAMICS OF ONCOGENESIS, CAUSING IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DISORDERS IN WILDLIFE WITH EFFECTS ON HOST–PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS, AND EVENTUALLY FACILITATING PATHOGEN SPILLOVERS. SECOND, THE EMERGENCE OF TRANSMISSIBLE CANCERS IN ANIMAL SPECIES (INCLUDING HUMANS) HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ACCELERATE BIODIVERSITY LOSS ACROSS ECOSYSTEMS AND TO BECOME PANDEMIC. IT IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND WHY, HOW, AND WHEN TRANSMISSIBLE CANCERS EMERGE AND SPREAD.

THE “ONE WORLD–ONE HEALTH” CONCEPT, INITIATED IN 2004, RECOGNIZES THE CLOSE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN HEALTH OF HUMANS AND THAT OF OTHER ANIMALS AND OUR SHARED ENVIRONMENT. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CONCEPT IS EVIDENCED BY THE ACCELERATED EMERGENCE OR RE-EMERGENCE OF ZOONOSES (E.G., EBOLA, CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC) OVER THE LAST DECADES (PEYRE ET AL., 2021). ALTHOUGH THE ONE HEALTH APPROACH PROPOSES A HOLISTIC VIEW OF HEALTH, IT HAS, AND STILL REMAINS, LARGELY FOCUSED ON ZOONOTIC AND VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES. REASONS BEHIND THIS BIAS ARE MULTIPLE, RANGING FROM THE FACT THAT HISTORICALLY IT HAS ORIGINATED FROM A COLLABORATION BETWEEN HUMAN AND VETERINARY MEDICINES, AND ALSO BECAUSE ZOONOTIC DISEASES UNDOUBTEDLY REPRESENT MAJOR HEALTH AND ECONOMIC THREATS TO HUMAN SOCIETIES. THE SCOPE HAS BROADENED WITH THE INCLUSION OF OTHER FIELDS, SUCH AS ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE (WHO, 2015), (ECO)TOXICOLOGY, AND HEALTH IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS (DESTOUMIEUX-GARZÓN ET AL., 2018), BUT NOT CANCER. THE IMPACT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS ON CANCER EMERGENCE IN HUMANS HAVE BEEN LARGELY DOCUMENTED (E.G., ANTHROPOGENIC POLLUTION, OCCUPATION, FOOD, AND LIFESTYLE; AKTIPIS & NESSE, 2013) (BRIFFA ET AL., 2020; ERREN ET AL., 2015; TURNER ET AL., 2020). THESE EFFECTS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES COULD INCREASE IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE (HIATT & BEYELER, 2020). BEYOND THIS ACKNOWLEDGED LINK BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENT AND CANCER, WE DISCUSS HERE THREE REASONS FOR A BROADER INCLUSION OF CANCER INTO THE ONE HEALTH CONCEPT. FIRST, THE INTERPLAY/INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CANCER AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES MAKE ARDUOUS TO SEPARATE THESE COMMUNICABLE AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES, AND THEIR COMBINATION COULD POSE HIGHER RISK FOR HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH. FOR INSTANCE, CANCERS CAN CAUSE IMMUNOSUPPRESSION 2020); CANCERS CAN ALSO BE INDUCED BY PATHOGENS (EWALD & SWAIN EWALD, 2015; JACQUELINE ET AL., 2017). HOWEVER, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE ROLE OF HUMAN-INDUCED CANCERS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES’ EMERGENCE AND SPREAD. HUMAN ACTIVITIES ELEVATE CANCER INCIDENCES FOR WILDLIFE SPECIES (VIA CHEMICAL POLLUTION, CHANGES IN DIET, AND REDUCTIONS IN GENETIC DIVERSITY; BAINES ET AL., 2021; GIRAUDEAU ET AL., 2018; SEPP ET AL., 2019; UJVARI ET AL., 2018). AS IN HUMANS, CANCER BURDENS GENERATE A RANGE OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DISORDERS IN LIVESTOCK, AND LIKELY IN WILDLIFE (POLLOCK & ROTH, 1989; VITTECOQ ET AL., 2013). ANIMALS WITH CANCER, HUMAN OR OTHERWISE, MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE, CONTAGIOUS, AND DEBILITATED BY INFECTIOUS DISEASES. THEREFORE, THE EVOLUTIONARY MISMATCH BETWEEN ENHANCED HUMAN-INDUCED CANCER RISKS AND MALADAPTED CANCER DEFENSE LEVELS IN ANIMALS WILL INDIRECTLY AMPLIFY PATHOGEN DYNAMICS IN WILDLIFE, IN BOTH NATURAL AND HUMAN-DOMINATED ECOSYSTEMS. IN UNDISTURBED NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS, A FRACTION OF PATHOGENS IS GENERALLY MAINTAINED BY THE PRESENCE OF IMMUNOCOMPROMISED INDIVIDUALS, A STABLE EQUILIBRIUM, THAT HAS BEEN REACHED OVER EVOLUTIONARY TIME (HASSELL ET AL., 2021). BY ACCELERATING CANCER INCIDENCE AND THE DYNAMICS OF ONCOGENESIS, ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES CAN DISRUPT THESE EQUILIBRIA. THESE ALTERED DYNAMICS ARE COMPLEX AND NOT MERELY CORRELATED WITH POLLUTION LEVELS, BUT ALSO DRIVEN BY, FOR EXAMPLE, THE DIFFERENT SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF EXPOSED SPECIES TO CARCINOGENESIS. FOR INSTANCE, A BENTHIC LIFESTYLE WITHIN FISH COMMUNITIES CONTRIBUTES TO ELEVATED CANCER INCIDENCE THROUGH CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO CONTAMINATED SEDIMENT AND/OR CONSUMPTION OF CONTAMINATED INVERTEBRATES (BLACK & BAUMANN, 1991; MARTINEAU ET AL., 2002). THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE DISTURBANCES ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT GIVEN THE CASCADE OF INDIRECT EFFECTS THAT MAY SUBSEQUENTLY OCCUR. FOR EXAMPLE, THE IMPACT OF HIGHER CANCER INCIDENCES AND CARCINOGENS WILL DEPEND ON THE SPECIES MOST AFFECTED BY CANCER (E.G., PREDATORS OR PREY SPECIES) AND THE RESULTING IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DISORDERS (SEE, FOR INSTANCE, PERRET ET AL., 2020). THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN ANIMAL'S IMMUNOSUPPRESSION AND CANCER BURDEN (E.G., LINEAR, EXPONENTIAL, NEGATIVE BINOMIAL, AND WITH OR WITHOUT CRITICAL THRESHOLDS) MAY ALSO VARY WITH SPECIES AND/OR WITH THE ORGAN IN WHICH MALIGNANCIES DEVELOP. CLEARLY, THE ROLES OF POLLUTION-INDUCED ONCOGENESIS AND IMMUNOSUPPRESSION IN BOOSTING PATHOGEN COMMUNITIES IN WILDLIFE AND THEIR SPREAD TO HUMANS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD AT THE MOMENT. GIVEN THAT PARASITISM AND DISEASE SPREAD MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES VIA MECHANISMS SUCH AS THE DILUTION EFFECT (CIVITELLO ET AL., 2015), POLLUTION-INDUCED ONCOGENESIS COULD AMPLIFY THESE TRANSFERS IF IT CONCOMITANTLY PROMOTES A DECLINE IN BIODIVERSITY. A SECOND REASON FOR ELEVATING THE IMPORTANCE OF CANCERS IN THE ONE HEALTH APPROACH CONCERNS CANCERS THAT CAN THEMSELVES BECOME TRANSMISSIBLE. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NINE KNOWN TRANSMISSIBLE CANCER LINEAGES (ONE IN DOGS, TWO IN TASMANIAN DEVIL POPULATIONS, AND SIX IN MARINE BIVALVES; DUJON, BRAMWELL, ET AL., 2020; DUJON, GATENBY, ET AL., 2020), SOME OF WHICH THREATEN THE SURVIVAL OF ANIMAL POPULATIONS (AND SPECIES) AND ARE DETRIMENTAL TO ECOSYSTEM STABILITY (SEE, FOR INSTANCE, HAMEDE ET AL., 2020). INDUBITABLY, THIS NUMBER IS A GROSS UNDERESTIMATE DUE TO POOR MONITORING OF CANCER IN WILDLIFE (DUJON, BRAMWELL, ET AL., 2020; DUJON, GATENBY, ET AL., 2020; DUJON, UJVARI, ET AL., 2020; UJVARI ET AL., 2016). THE CONDITIONS FOR THE EMERGENCE OF TRANSMISSIBLE CANCERS, WHILE POORLY UNDERSTOOD, REQUIRE A PERFECT STORM OF SEQUENTIAL STEPS THAT IS REMINISCENT OF A PARASITIC LIFESTYLE. FIRST, THE TUMOR MUST SHED A LARGE NUMBER OF CELLS THAT ARE ABLE TO SURVIVE OUTSIDE OF OR ON THE SURFACE OF THE ORIGINAL HOST. THOSE CELLS, WHEN IN CONTACT WITH A NEW HOST, MUST THEN EVADE IMMUNE RECOGNITION (PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING IN VERTEBRATES) AND SUCCESSFULLY PROLIFERATE IN THE CORRECT TISSUE OF THE NEW HOST (UJVARI ET AL., 2017). ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS, LACK OF GENETIC DIVERSITY WITHIN THE HOST POPULATION, AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES MAY WEAKEN THE HOST'S IMMUNE SYSTEM ENABLING TRANSMISSION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF CANCER CELLS FROM ONE INDIVIDUAL TO ANOTHER (DUJON, BRAMWELL, ET AL., 2020; DUJON, GATENBY, ET AL., 2020; DUJON, UJVARI, ET AL., 2020). HUMAN ACTIVITIES MAY ALSO DISPERSE CERTAIN TRANSMISSIBLE CANCERS ACROSS THE GLOBE, GIVING PREVIOUSLY ISOLATED OUTBREAKS PANDEMIC POTENTIALS. ALREADY, A SINGLE TRANSMISSIBLE CANCER LINEAGE HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN MULTIPLE MARINE MUSSEL SPECIES ACROSS MULTIPLE OCEANS, SUGGESTING DISPERSAL BY AQUACULTURE AND/OR SHIPPING (BRAMWELL ET AL., 2021; SKAZINA ET AL., 2021; YONEMITSU ET AL., 2019). A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF TRANSMISSIBLE CANCERS ON ECOSYSTEMS AND BIODIVERSITY WILL REQUIRE INTEGRATING TOOLS FROM LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY, CONSERVATION BIOLOGY, AND EPIDEMIOLOGY TO IDENTIFY WILDLIFE SPECIES AT RISK OF CONTAGIOUS MALIGNANT CELL LINES, DETECT THEIR EMERGENCE, ANTICIPATE THEIR SPREAD, AND EVALUATE CONSEQUENCES TO NATURAL AND HUMAN-DOMINATED ECOSYSTEMS (BRAMWELL ET AL., 2021; DUJON ET AL., 2020; DUJON, GATENBY, ET AL., 2020; DUJON, UJVARI, ET AL., 2020). A WORST-CASE SCENARIO MIGHT INVOLVE THE EMERGENCE OF A COMMUNICABLE CANCER IN HUMANS OR IN LIVESTOCK, YIELDING ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN/ANIMAL HEALTH CRISES SIMILAR TO CLASSICAL EPIDEMICS AND EPIZOOTICS. FINALLY, A THIRD REASON TO CONSIDER CANCER IN THE ONE HEALTH APPROACH LIES IN THE SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS PROVIDED BY COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY FOCUSING ON THE DIVERSE TUMOR SUPPRESSION MECHANISMS THAT HAVE EVOLVED ACROSS THE ANIMAL KINGDOM (NUNNEY ET AL., 2015; SCHIFFMAN & BREEN, 2015). CANCERS APPEARED DURING THE TRANSITION FROM UNICELLULAR TO METAZOAN LIFE, APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION YEARS AGO (DOMAZET-LOŠO & TAUTZ, 2010). CANCERS OCCUR IN ALL BRANCHES OF MULTICELLULAR LIFE, AND THEY HAVE EVOLVED DIVERSE ADAPTATIONS TO PREVENT CANCER INITIATION, SUPPRESS MALIGNANT PROGRESSION, AND ALLEVIATE NEGATIVE FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF TUMOR BURDENS (AKTIPIS ET AL., 2015). FOR INSTANCE, ONE MIGHT EXPECT LARGE/LONG-LIVED ANIMALS TO HAVE MORE CANCERS THAN SMALLER/SHORTER-LIVED ONES, GIVEN THAT THE FORMER HAVE MANY MORE CELL DIVISIONS THAT POTENTIAL GIVE RISE TO CANCER-INITIATING MUTATIONS, BUT SUCH A RELATIONSHIP ACROSS SPECIES IS NOT OBSERVED, DUE TO THE VARIOUS MECHANISMS OF CANCER RESISTANCE THAT HAVE EVOLVED IN LARGE AND LONG-LIVED SPECIES (I.E., PETO'S PARADOX, TOLLIS ET AL., 2017). EVEN IN SMALLER SPECIES, UNDER PARTICULAR ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, SELECTION CAN FAVOR HIGH LEVELS OF CANCER RESISTANCE, AS OBSERVED IN NAKED-MOLE RATS AND BATS (LAMBERT & PORTFORS, 2017; SELUANOV ET AL., 2018; TIAN ET AL., 2013). SCIENTISTS ARE INCREASINGLY FOCUSING ON THE WAYS NATURAL SELECTION HAS PROTECTED ANIMAL SPECIES FROM CANCER (BOUTRY ET AL., 2020). THIS WORK IS DECIPHERING THE UNDERLYING TISSUE, CELLULAR, AND GENOMIC MECHANISMS IN CANCER-RESISTANT/TOLERANT SPECIES (ABEGGLEN ET AL., 2015; KEANE ET AL., 2015; SULAK ET AL., 2016). ANOTHER PARTICULARLY INTERESTING DIRECTION OF COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY INVESTIGATES THE LOCAL EVOLUTION OF ADAPTATIONS IN SPECIES OR POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN LIVING IN ENVIRONMENTS WITH EXCESSES OF NATURALLY OCCURRING CARCINOGENS (HOURDEZ ET AL., 2021; VITTECOQ ET AL., 2018). TO WHAT EXTENT DO THESE POPULATIONS SHOW ADAPTATIONS TO PREVENT THE EMERGENCE OF CANCER VERSUS ADAPTATIONS TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CANCER BURDENS? TO WHAT EXTENT DO THESE POPULATIONS’ ANTI-CANCER ADAPTATIONS INCREASE OR DECREASE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES? OF PARTICULAR INTEREST WOULD BE ADAPTATIONS THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCE CANCER AND INFECTIONS. STUDYING SPECIES AND ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES CHRONICALLY EXPOSED TO CARCINOGENS, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON HOST–PATHOGEN DYNAMICS, COULD SHED LIGHT ON THE POSSIBLE IMPACTS AND REPERCUSSIONS OF HUMAN-INDUCED CANCERS WITHIN WILDLIFE SPECIES (VITTECOQ ET AL., 2018). FROM A MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE, THE ADAPTATIONS OF LONG-LIVED MAMMALS AND OTHER SPECIES FOR PREVENTING AND SUPPRESSING CANCER SHOULD INSPIRE NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO CANCER, SUCH AS NOVEL CANCER TREATMENT STRATEGIES, BY MIMICKING THE PROCESSES ALLOWING THESE ORGANISMS TO PREVENT OR LIMIT MALIGNANT PROGRESSION DESPITE HIGH LEVELS OF MUTAGENIC SUBSTANCES. THUS, COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY OFFERS KEY INSIGHTS INTO CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY, PREVENTION, AND NOVEL THERAPIES FOR HUMANS. IN CONCLUSION, HUMANS, DOMESTIC ANIMALS, AND WILDLIFE SPECIES ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AND EXPOSURE TO TOXIC HAZARDS FROM ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES. WHILE IT IS WELL RECOGNIZED THAT THESE PROCESSES DIRECTLY AFFECT IMMUNITY AND HENCE PATHOGEN DYNAMICS (E.G., DITTMAR ET AL., 2014; TRACY ET AL., 2020), MUCH LESS IS KNOWN CONCERNING THE INDIRECT LINKS RESULTING FROM INTERACTIONS INVOLVING NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES, SUCH AS CANCER. THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS DO NOT NECESSARILY YIELD THE SAME OUTCOMES. CANCER-CAUSING OR CANCER-ASSOCIATED PROCESSES ARE UNDOUBTEDLY AN UNDERAPPRECIATED HEALTH CONSEQUENCE OF MODERN ANTHROPOGENIC CHANGES, AND THEY CANNOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION FROM OTHER BIOLOGICAL PLAYERS IN ECOSYSTEMS, ESPECIALLY PATHOGENS. ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS, SOONER OR LATER, ARE USUALLY FOLLOWED BY EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES, LEADING TO NOVEL EQUILIBRIA IN ECOSYSTEMS. HOWEVER, WE CURRENTLY IGNORE HOW THE NOVEL EQUILIBRIA WILL BE ACHIEVED AND SHAPED IN AN INCREASINGLY STRESSFUL WORLD. A PARTICULAR QUESTION REMAINING TO BE ANSWERED IS HOW POLLUTION AND CONSEQUENT ONCOGENIC PROCESSES WILL IMPACT INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THUS HUMAN HEALTH PARTICULARLY BEFORE REACHING A NOVEL EQUILIBRIUM. EXPLORING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN HUMAN ACTIVITIES, NOVEL CANCER RISKS EXPERIENCED BY WILDLIFE SPECIES, CANCER DEFENSE EVOLUTION, BIOTIC INTERACTIONS, AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS, NOTABLY THOSE TRANSMISSIBLE TO HUMANS, SHOULD BECOME A STRONGER TOPIC WITHIN THE ONE HEALTH PERSPECTIVE (FIGURE 1). BECAUSE ONE SINGLE METHOD OR MODEL CANNOT THOROUGHLY DESCRIBE THESE COMPLEX DYNAMICS, MORE THAN EVER RESEARCHERS MUST ENGAGE IN GREATER EXCHANGES AND COLLABORATIONS INVOLVING DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES, SUCH AS FIELD AND EXPERIMENTAL ECOLOGY, EPIDEMIOLOGY, ECO-TOXICOLOGY, IMMUNOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, ONCOLOGY, AND PHARMACY.

IN SOUTH AFRICA, AN ESTIMATED AREA OF 20 MILLION HA IS UNDER WILDLIFE RANCHING, A FORM OF PRIVATE LAND ENTERPRISE THAT ADOPTS WILDLIFE-BASED LAND USES FOR COMMERCIAL GAIN. THIS LAND HAS POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, BUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS OCCURS HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED. USING STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRES OF 226 WILDLIFE RANCHERS, WE ASSESSED HOW THE SECTOR CONTRIBUTES TOWARDS THE CONSERVATION OF UNGULATES AND ELEPHANTS (HEREAFTER HERBIVORES). OVERALL, 40 HERBIVORE SPECIES WERE PRESENT ACROSS THE SAMPLE, WHERE INDIVIDUAL RANCHES HAD A MEAN OF 15.0 (± 4.8) SPECIES, 1.9 (± 1.5) THREATENED SPECIES, AND 3.6 (± 3.1) EXTRALIMITAL SPECIES PER PROPERTY. IN COMPARISON TO 54 STATE PAS, WILDLIFE RANCHES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS, MORE THREATENED SPECIES BUT MORE EXTRALIMITAL SPECIES WHEN PROPERTY/RESERVE SIZE WAS CONTROLLED FOR. RANCHES CONDUCTING TROPHY HUNTING HAD SIMILAR SPECIES RICHNESS AND NUMBERS OF EXTRALIMITAL SPECIES PER HA, BUT FEWER THREATENED SPECIES WHEN COMPARED TO RANCHES CONDUCTING ECOTOURISM. WE ESTIMATE THAT 4.66–7.25 MILLION HERBIVORES OCCUR ON RANCHES NATIONALLY, REPRESENTING ONE OF THE FEW EXAMPLES ON EARTH WHERE INDIGENOUS MAMMAL POPULATIONS ARE THRIVING AND DEMONSTRATING HOW SUSTAINABLE USE CAN LEAD TO REWILDING. WE DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF WIDESPREAD GAME FENCING ON LANDSCAPE FRAGMENTATION AND GENE FLOW, AS WELL AS HOW THE WIDESPREAD OCCURRENCE OF EXTRALIMITAL SPECIES MAY LEAD TO HYBRIDISATION, BIOTIC HOMOGENISATION, AND CHANGES TO VEGETATION DYNAMICS.

HOWEVER, THE GROWING INTEREST IN NON-NATIVE REPTILES AS PETS HAS POSED SERIOUS CONCERNS TO WILDLIFE MANAGERS AND CONSERVATIONISTS. INSTITUTING EFFECTIVE POLICIES REGARDING NON-NATIVE REPTILES REQUIRES A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE POTENTIAL RANGE OF SPECIES IN NEW ENVIRONMENTS. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED AN ENSEMBLE OF TEN SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS TO PREDICT THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION FOR 23 OF THE MOST COMMONLY TRADED SPECIES OF REPTILES ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. WE USED TEN MODELING TECHNIQUES IMPLEMENTED IN THE BIOMOD2 PACKAGE AND ENSEMBLE FORECASTS. FINAL MODELS USED THIRTY ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, INCLUDING CLIMATIC, TOPOGRAPHIC, AND LAND COVER/LAND USE VARIABLES. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT ALL MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES INCLUDED SUITABLE HABITATS FOR AT LEAST SIX SPECIES, EXCEPT QATAR, KUWAIT AND BAHRAIN, FOR WHICH THE MODELS DID NOT PREDICT ANY SUITABLE HABITATS.

IN RECENT YEARS, ICHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS HAS EMERGED AS A PROXY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PALEOENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT, AS WELL AS THEIR EFFECT(S) ON THE BIOTA AND ITS RECOVERY. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE ICHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF AN EXTENDED UPPER PERMIAN – LOWER TRIASSIC SUCCESSION FROM THE DD-1 CORE, DRILLED IN DELTADALEN, CENTRAL SPITSBERGEN. VARIATIONS IN DEGREE OF BIOTURBATION AND ICHNODIVERSITY ACROSS THE PERMIAN-TRIASSIC TRANSITION ALLOW FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF PRE-, SYN-, AND POST-EPME PHASES. PRE-EPME IS CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH DEGREE OF BIOTURBATION (BI = 5), AND A DIVERSE TRACE FOSSIL ASSEMBLAGE (13 ICHNOTAXA) WITH ABUNDANT NEREITES, FREQUENT PLANOLITES AND PHYCOSIPHON, AND THE MORE OR LESS LOCAL RECORD OF ASTEROSOMA, BERGAUERIA, CHONDRITES, MACARONICHNUS, PALAEOPHYCUS, TAENIDIUM, TEICHICHNUS, THALASSINOIDES, ZOOPHYCOS, MENISCATE HORIZONTAL BURROWS AND UNDIFFERENTIATED VERTICAL TRACES, INDICATIVE OF OXYGENATED BOTTOM AND PORE-WATERS, AS WELL AS HIGH NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY IN THE BENTHIC HABITAT. THE EPME WAS FOLLOWED BY AN INTERVAL CHARACTERIZED BY THE SCARCITY (BI = 1) OR EVEN ABSENCE (BI = 0) OF TRACE FOSSILS. THE DECREASE IN ICHNODIVERSITY WAS ABRUPT AT FIRST AND MORE PROGRESSIVE SUBSEQUENTLY, AS THE CONDITIONS WERE INHOSPITABLE (I.E., VERY LOW OXYGENATION) IN THE BENTHIC HABITAT. IN THIS CONTEXT, SHORT-LASTING EPISODES OF IMPROVED PALEOENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS (FROM ANOXIA TO DYSOXIA) ALLOWED FOR INTERMITTENT COLONIZATION OF THE SUBSTRATE. THE POST-EPME INTERVAL IS CHARACTERIZED BY A GRADUAL RECOVERY OF THE TRACE MAKER COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF ABUNDANCE (BI FROM 1 TO 5) AND ICHNODIVERSITY (TOTAL OF 10 ICHNOTAXA), REVEALING A RELATIVELY RAPID REESTABLISHMENT OF FAVOURABLE PALEOENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS FOR THE BENTHIC HABITAT, WITH BETTER‑OXYGENATED BOTTOM AND PORE-WATERS, AS WELL AS IMPROVED NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY AT OR JUST BELOW THE SEAFLOOR.

ALPHA TAXONOMY HISTORICALLY RELIED ON EXPERT KNOWLEDGE TO DESCRIBE NEW SPECIES USING PHENOTYPIC AND BIOGEOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE, WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF INVESTIGATOR SUBJECTIVITY. IN CONTRAST, DNA-BASED METHODS USING THE MULTISPECIES COALESCENT MODEL (MSC) PROMISE A MORE OBJECTIVE APPROACH TO DESCRIBING BIODIVERSITY. HOWEVER, RECENT CRITICISMS SUGGEST THAT UNDER SOME CONDITIONS THE MSC MAY OVER-SPLIT LINEAGES, IDENTIFYING SPECIES THAT DO NOT REFLECT BIOLOGICAL REALITY. HERE, WE RECONCILE THESE APPROACHES USING EMPIRICAL DATA FOR THE GREENTHROAT DARTER COMPLEX (ETHEOSTOMA LEPIDUM), A SMALL FRESHWATER FISH SPECIES WITH A DISJUNCT DISTRIBUTION IN TEXAS AND NEW MEXICO, USA. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT MSC METHODS RECOGNIZES ALL NINE SAMPLED POPULATIONS AS DISTINCT SPECIES, SOMETIMES SPLITTING SPECIMENS FROM A SINGLE LOCALITY INTO MULTIPLE SPECIES. HOWEVER, ENVIRONMENTAL, PHENOTYPIC, AND BIOGEOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE DO NOT CORROBORATE THE NINE SPECIES SUPPORTED BY THE MSC. INSTEAD, COLLECTIVE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT E. LEPIDUM IS COMPRISED OF JUST THREE SPECIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY: ETHEOSTOMA LEPIDUM (GREENTHROAT DARTER) IN RIVERS DRAINING THE EASTERN EDWARDS PLATEAU, ETHEOSTOMA CF. LEPIDUM (TEXAS DARTER) IN THE CONCHO AND SAN SABA RIVERS, AND ETHEOSTOMA CF. LEPIDUM (PECOS DARTER) IN THE PECOS RIVER. THE PECOS DARTER IS LIKELY HIGHLY IMPERILED DUE TO ITS LOCALIZED DISTRIBUTION AND RELIANCE ON VANISHING SPRING-FED STREAM HABITATS.

WE ANALYSED ~2 MILLION DETECTIONS FOR 23 SPECIES, RANGING FROM REEF FISH SUCH AS NASSAU GROUPER (EPINEPHELUS STRIATUS, SERRANIDAE) TO MIGRATORY APEX PREDATORS SUCH AS WHITE SHARKS (CARCHARODON CARCHARIAS, LAMNIDAE). TO FACILITATE COMPARISONS ACROSS SPECIES, WE USED AN ECO-EVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT STRATEGY FRAMEWORK THAT IDENTIFIED MEASURABLE MOVEMENT TRAITS AND THEIR PROXIMATE AND ULTIMATE DRIVERS. DETECTABILITY WAS SPECIES-SPECIFIC AND QUANTIFIED WITH A DETECTION POTENTIAL INDEX. LIFE STAGES DETECTED IN THE STUDY AREA VARIED BY SPECIES AND RESIDENCY VARIED WITH LIFE STAGE. FOUR ANNUAL MOVEMENT TYPES WERE IDENTIFIED AS FOLLOWS: HIGH SITE-FIDELITY RESIDENTS, RANGE RESIDENTS, SEASONAL MIGRANTS AND GENERAL MIGRANTS. THE ENDANGERED SMALLTOOTH SAWFISH (PRISTIS PECTINATA, PRISTIDAE), A SEASONAL MIGRANT, EXHIBITED THE GREATEST WITHIN-ECOSYSTEM CONNECTIVITY. SITE ATTACHMENT, STOPOVER AND DEEP-WATER MIGRATION BEHAVIOURS DIFFERED BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS, SPECIES AND ANNUAL MOVEMENT TYPES. ALL APEX PREDATORS WERE MIGRATORY.

HERE, WE PRESENT A CASE STUDY OF PEAT MEADOWS THAT WERE DRAINED FROM THE MID 1980S TO 1990S AND WERE RESTORED BY INTERRUPTING DRAINAGE PIPES THROUGH CLAY SEALED TRENCHES. THIS TRIAL WAS SUBJECT OF EXTENSIVE SURVEY OF PLANT, SOIL FAUNA AND SOIL CHEMISTRY, WHICH WAS DONE JUST BEFORE RESTORATION AND THEN REPEATED 20 YEARS LATER. THE WATER TABLE WAS THE CLOSEST TO SURFACE IN UNDRAINED MEADOWS AND MUCH DEEPER IN DRAINED AND RESTORED MEADOWS DURING BOTH TIMES. IN THE RESTORED MEADOW, SOME INCREASE OF THE WATER TABLE WAS OBSERVED, BUT THE WATER TABLE WAS MOSTLY WITHIN 60 CM OF THE SURFACE. UNDRAINED MEADOW WAS MUCH RICHER IN SOIL ORGANIC CARBON. PLANT COMMUNITIES IN BOTH DRAINED AND RESTORED PLOTS BECOME CLOSER TO THOSE IN UNDRAINED REMNANTS 20 YEARS AFTER RESTORATION. COMMUNITY WEIGHTED MEAN FOR ELLENBERGER VALUES SHOWED THAT UNDRAINED PEAT MEADOW REMNANTS WERE MORE OLIGOTROPHIC THAN DRAINED AND RESTORED SITES. SOIL FAUNA COMMUNITIES OF UNDRAINED REMNANTS AND BOTH DRAINED TREATMENTS WERE CLEARLY SEPARATED IN 1990S AND LUMPED TOGETHER 20 YEARS LATER. THIS WAS CAUSED BY A SHIFT IN THE COMMUNITIES IN BOTH DRAINED TREATMENTS BUT ALSO BY DEGRADATION OF UNDRAINED REMNANTS, WHICH SHIFTED TOWARDS DRAINED SITES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT RESTORATION SLIGHTLY SHIFTED THE COMMUNITIES TOWARDS THE UNDRAINED REFERENCE SITES, BUT THE SHIFT WAS NOT MUCH BIGGER THAT THOSE IN DRAINED SITES AND IN BOTH CASES, DO NOT RESULT IN PEAT FORMATION.

RES.,1,"ONE OF THE MAJOR CAUSES OF AQUATIC BIODIVERSITY LOSS IS THE CONTAMINATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT BY PESTICIDES. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF STUDIES ON THE SUBJECT, THERE ARE STILL FEW THAT DEAL WITH THE EFFECTS OF CARBOFURAN ON NATIVE SPECIES IN BRAZIL. ALTHOUGH CARBOFURAN IS WIDELY USED IN BRAZIL, ITS ACTION ON NATIVE ORGANISMS, SUCH AS THE ATLANTIC FOREST LAMBARI DEUTERODON IGUAPE, HAS NOT YET BEEN STUDIED. THIS WORK AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO CARBOFURAN ON THE FISH D. IGUAPE, CONSIDERING THE BEHAVIOR AND SPECIFIC OXYGEN CONSUMPTION AS END POINTS. OPERCULAR MOVEMENTS, DORSAL FIN MOVEMENTS, AND SWIMMING SPEED WERE ANALYZED AS BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS. TO ASSESS SPECIFIC OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, FISH WERE SUBJECTED TO CONCENTRATIONS OF 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, AND 0.5 MG/L, FOR 24 H. FOR BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS, FISH REMAINED EXPOSED TO CARBOFURAN AT CONCENTRATIONS OF 0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, AND 0.5 MG/L, IN PERIODS OF 0, 2, 24, AND 48 H. THE BEHAVIOR WAS STUDIED THROUGH FILMING, ANALYZED WITH THE FREE SOFTWARE, TRACKER 4.92 (OPEN SOURCE PHYSICS). THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE AN INCREASE IN OPERCULAR MOVEMENTS (18% ± 2.65) AND A DECREASE IN DORSAL FIN MOVEMENTS (− 21.2% ± 2.97), AS WELL AS IN SWIMMING SPEED (− 58.3% ± 1.83) OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN OXYGEN CONSUMPTION OF 58.4% IN FISH EXPOSED TO THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF CARBOFURAN. THUS, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT CARBOFURAN ALTERED D. IGUAPE’S BEHAVIOR AND OXYGEN CONSUMPTION. THE SPECIES WAS SENSITIVE TO CARBOFURAN CONCENTRATIONS AND CAN BE USED AS A BIOINDICATOR. © 2021, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH GERMANY, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE.",NA,"CARBOFURAN, 1563-66-2; CARBOFURAN; PESTICIDES; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL",ESPLE,"BARBIERI, E.; INSTITUTO DE PESCA – GOVERNO DO ESTADO DE SÃO PAULO, AV.

SUCH LITIGATION REMAINS LARGELY UNTESTED IN MOST BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS AND IS RARELY USED IN RESPONSE TO LEADING DRIVERS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS, INCLUDING ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE. YET, LIABILITY LITIGATION IS A POTENTIALLY GROUND-BREAKING CONSERVATION STRATEGY TO REMEDY HARM TO BIODIVERSITY BY SEEKING LEGAL REMEDIES SUCH AS SPECIES REHABILITATION, PUBLIC APOLOGIES, HABITAT CONSERVATION AND EDUCATION, WITH THE GOAL OF MAKING THE INJURED PARTIES ‘WHOLE’. HOWEVER, PRECEDENT CASES, EXPERT GUIDANCE, AND EXPERIENCE TO BUILD SUCH CONSERVATION LAWSUITS IS NASCENT IN MOST COUNTRIES. WE PROPOSE A SIMPLIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPING CONSERVATION LAWSUITS ACROSS COUNTRIES AND CONSERVATION CONTEXTS. WE EXPLAIN LIABILITY LITIGATION IN TERMS OF THREE DIMENSIONS: (1) DEFINING THE HARM THAT OCCURRED, (2) IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE REMEDIES TO THAT HARM, AND (3) UNDERSTANDING WHAT REMEDIES THE LAW AND COURTS WILL ALLOW. WE ILLUSTRATE THE FRAMEWORK VIA A HYPOTHETICAL LAWSUIT AGAINST AN ILLEGAL ORANGUTAN TRADER IN INDONESIA. WE HIGHLIGHT THAT CONSERVATIONISTS’ EXPERTISE IS ESSENTIAL TO CHARACTERIZING HARM AND IDENTIFYING REMEDIES, AND COULD MORE ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO STRATEGIC, SCIENCE-BASED LITIGATION.

RISKS TO HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ECONOMY ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH INNS AND INVASIVE PARASITES; HOWEVER, WE UNDERSTAND LITTLE ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF SYMBIOTIC ORGANISMS CO-INVADING ALONGSIDE INNS. THIS LACK OF CLARITY IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE ‘ONE HEALTH’ PREROGATIVE, WHICH AIMS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN HUMAN, WILDLIFE, AND ECOSYSTEM HEALTH. TO EXPLORE SYMBIONT DIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVASIVE CRUSTACEAN GROUP (INCLUDING: CRAB, LOBSTER, CRAYFISH, SHRIMP, AMPHIPOD, ISOPOD, COPEPOD, BARNACLE, OTHER) (N = 323) DERIVED FROM 1054 AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES CLASSED AS INNS ACROSS DATABASES, WE COMPILE LITERATURE (YEAR RANGE 1800–2017) FROM THE NATIVE AND INVASIVE RANGE TO PROVIDE A CUMULATIVE SYMBIONT PROFILE FOR EACH SPECIES. OUR SEARCH INDICATED THAT 31.2% OF INN CRUSTACEANS WERE KNOWN TO HOLD AT LEAST ONE SYMBIONT, WHEREBY THE REMAINING 68.8% HAD NO DOCUMENTED SYMBIONTS. THE SYMBIONT LIST MOSTLY CONSISTED OF HELMINTHS (27% OF THE KNOWN DIVERSITY) AND PROTISTS (23% OF THE KNOWN DIVERSITY), FOLLOWED BY BACTERIA (12%) AND MICROSPORIDIANS (12%). CARCINUS MAENAS, THE GLOBALLY INVASIVE AND EXTREMELY WELL-STUDIED GREEN CRAB, HARBOURED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF SYMBIONTS (N = 72). ADDITIONAL SCREENING IS IMPERATIVE TO BECOME MORE INFORMED ON INVASIVE SYMBIONT THREATS. WE REVEAL THAT FEW STUDIES PROVIDE TRULY EMPIRICAL DATA THAT CONNECT BIODIVERSITY LOSS WITH INVASIVE PARASITES AND SUGGEST THAT DEDICATED STUDIES ON AVAILABLE SYSTEMS WILL HELP TO PROVIDE VITAL CASE STUDIES. DESPITE THE LACK OF EMPIRICAL DATA, CO-INVASIVE PARASITES OF INVASIVE INVERTEBRATES APPEAR CAPABLE OF LOWERING LOCAL BIODIVERSITY, ESPECIALLY BY CAUSING BEHAVIOURAL CHANGE AND MORTALITY IN NATIVE SPECIES. ALTERNATIVELY, SEVERAL INVASIVE PARASITES APPEAR TO PROTECT ECOSYSTEMS BY CONTROLLING THE IMPACT AND POPULATION SIZE OF THEIR INVASIVE HOST.

VET. SCI.,1,"EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES ARE ONE OF THE MULTIPLE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE CURRENT “BIODIVERSITY CRISIS”. AS PART OF THE WORLDWIDE BIODIVERSITY CRISIS, AMPHIBIAN POPULATIONS ARE DECLINING GLOBALLY. CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS, AN EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASE, CAUSED BY THE FUNGAL PATHOGEN BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS (BD), IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF AMPHIBIAN POPULATION DECLINES. THIS FUNGUS PRIMARILY AFFECTS KERATINIZED STRUCTURES IN LARVAL, JUVENILE, AND ADULT AMPHIBIANS AS WELL AS HEART FUNCTION. HOWEVER, WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HOW BD CAN IMPACT EMBRYOS AS WELL AS POTENTIAL LATENT EFFECTS OF BD EXPOSURE OVER ONTOGENY. USING TWO DIFFERENT BD STRAINS AND MULTIPLE EXPOSURE TIMES, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF BD EXPOSURE IN PACIFIC CHORUS FROG (PSEUDACRIS REGILLA), WESTERN TOAD (ANAXYRUS BOREAS) AND AMERICAN BULLFROG (LITHOBATES CATESBEIANUS) LIFE STAGES. USING A FACTORIAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, EMBRYOS OF THESE THREE SPECIES WERE EXPOSED TO BD AT EARLY AND LATE EMBRYONIC STAGES, WITH SOME INDIVIDUALS RE-EXPOSED AFTER HATCHING. EMBRYONIC BD EXPOSURE RESULTED IN DIFFERENTIAL SURVIVAL AS A FUNCTION OF HOST SPECIES, BD STRAIN AND TIMING OF EXPOSURE. P. REGILLA EXPERIENCED EMBRYONIC MORTALITY WHEN EXPOSED DURING LATER DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES TO ONE BD STRAIN. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE TREATMENTS IN EMBRYONIC MORTALITY OF A. BOREAS AND EMBRYONIC MORTALITY OF L. CATESBEIANUS OCCURRED IN ALL BD EXPOSURE TREATMENTS. WE DETECTED LATENT EFFECTS IN A. BOREAS AND L. CATESBEIANUS LARVAE, AS MORTALITY INCREASED WHEN INDIVIDUALS HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO ANY OF THE BD STRAINS DURING THE EMBRYONIC STAGE. WE ALSO DETECTED DIRECT EFFECTS ON LARVAL MORTALITY IN ALL THREE ANURAN SPECIES AS A FUNCTION OF BD STRAIN, AND WHEN INDIVIDUALS WERE DOUBLE EXPOSED (LATE IN THE EMBRYONIC STAGE AND AGAIN AS LARVAE). OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT EXPOSURE TO BD CAN DIRECTLY AFFECT EMBRYO SURVIVAL AND HAS DIRECT AND LATENT EFFECTS ON LARVAE SURVIVAL OF BOTH NATIVE AND INVASIVE SPECIES. HOWEVER, THESE IMPACTS WERE HIGHLY CONTEXT DEPENDENT, WITH TIMING OF EXPOSURE AND BD STRAIN INFLUENCING THE SEVERITY OF THE EFFECTS.

THE BIODIVERSITY PROVIDES A WIDE ARRAY OF PROVISION AND CULTURAL-ECOLOGICAL SERVICES TO URBAN RESIDENTS, BUT IT IS BEING OVEREXPLOITED TO THE POINT OF CRISIS. THE CRISIS IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE EXPANDING ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITH A HIGH URBANIZATION RATE AND BIODIVERSITY LEVEL LIKE VIETNAM. WHILE SUPPLY-SIDE MEASURES ARE INEFFECTIVE IN REDUCING BIODIVERSITY LOSS, RESEARCHERS HAVE SUGGESTED DEMAND-SIDE MEASURES AS SUPPLEMENTS, SUCH AS SOCIAL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN URBAN AREAS.

THIS NEGATIVE INTERACTION IS INFLUENCED BY ATTITUDES (FEELINGS, ACTIONS, AND PERCEPTIONS) OF HUMANS TOWARDS CERTAIN SPECIES. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF REPTILES IN FOOD CHAINS AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, THEY ARE OFTEN NEGATIVELY PERCEIVED, RESULTING IN FEAR AND PERSECUTION. IN THIS SCENARIO, EDUCATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (ESD) MAY CONTRIBUTE FOR STUDENTS TO DEVELOP POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS NATURE AND, IN PARTICULAR, TOWARDS REPTILE CONSERVATION. SOME STUDIES SHOWED THAT WATCHING WILDLIFE MOVIES IMPROVES ATTITUDES OF PEOPLE TOWARDS WILDLIFE. HOWEVER, FEW INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON THE IMPACT OF ENGAGING PEOPLE IN MOVIE PRODUCTION IN THEIR ATTITUDES ON BIODIVERSITY. HERE WE PRESENT AN EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY AND DESCRIBE A PROJECT-BASED LEARNING ACTIVITY (PBL) IMPLEMENTED WITH CABO VERDEAN HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS AND PLANNED TO IMPROVE THEIR PERCEPTIONS, FEELINGS AND ACTIONS TOWARDS REPTILES IN GENERAL, AND THE THREATENED ENDEMIC SPECIES C. VAILLANTI IN PARTICULAR. WE ASKED STUDENTS TO WRITE A SCRIPT, SHOOT AND PRODUCE A SHORT FILM THAT COULD IMPROVE THE ATTITUDES OF THEIR COMMUNITY TOWARDS THIS ENDEMIC SPECIES. THIS MOVIE WAS THEN PRESENTED TO THE COMMUNITY IN A PUBLIC EVENT AND SUBJECTED TO A CONTENT ANALYSIS. TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THE ACTIVITY ON STUDENTS, THEY WERE ASKED TO FILL IN TWO QUESTIONNAIRES, BEFORE AND AFTER THE ACTIVITY. OUR RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF POSITIVE FEELINGS OF STUDENTS ABOUT THE REPTILES, AND INCREASED PERCEPTION OF THEIR IMPORTANCE, AND OF POSITIVE ACTIONS TOWARDS C. VAILLANTI FROM PRE TO POST TEST. THE MOVIE CONTENT ANALYSES AND INTERVIEWS SHOWED THAT STUDENTS LEARNED ABOUT SPECIES BIOLOGY, THREATS AND REASONS FOR ITS CONSERVATION, OF WHICH ENDEMICITY WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED.

WE ESTIMATED THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BARRIERS ON FISH SPECIES RICHNESS AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE ALONG AN ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT IN THE MAIN STEM OF THE RIVER ALLIER (FRANCE). USING EDNA METABARCODING, WE IDENTIFIED 24 FISH ZERO-RADIUS OPERATIONAL TAXONOMIC UNITS (ZOTUS), CORRESPONDING TO 26 SPECIES DISTRIBUTED ALONG THE MAIN STEM OF THE RIVER. ELEVATION EXPLAINED THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF VARIATION IN FISH DISTRIBUTION, TOGETHER WITH AVERAGE FLOW, BARRIER DENSITY AND ITS INTERACTION WITH CUMULATIVE BARRIER HEIGHT. BASED ON EDNA, THE LARGEST DISCONTINUITY IN SPECIES RICHNESS WAS NOT RELATED TO THE LOCATION OF POUTÈS, THE LARGEST DAM IN THE SYSTEM, BUT LOCATED DOWNSTREAM FROM IT. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE MORE OBVIOUS EFFECTS OF LARGE DAMS ON MIGRATORY FISH SUCH AS THE ATLANTIC SALMON, THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SMALL BARRIERS CAN HAVE WIDESPREAD IMPACTS ON FISH SPECIES RICHNESS AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE, WHICH SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED.

THIS STUDY DETAILS THE LAST ∼90 Y OF IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS IN ONE OF THE MOST BIOLOGICALLY DIVERSE, YET POORLY UNDERSTOOD, TROPICAL WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS OF THE REGION. THE LAKE IS LISTED AS A RAMSAR WETLAND OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE, YET, SINCE INITIAL EUROPEAN CONTACT IN THE 1930S AND THE OPENING OF MINERAL RESOURCE EXTRACTION FACILITIES IN THE 1990S, THERE HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN DEFORESTATION AND AN INFLUX OF PEOPLE TO THE AREA. USING MULTIPROXY PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RECORDS FROM LAKE SEDIMENTS, WE SHOW HOW THESE ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS HAVE TRANSFORMED LAKE KUTUBU. THE RECENT COLLAPSE OF ALGAL COMMUNITIES REPRESENTS AN ECOLOGICAL TIPPING POINT THAT IS LIKELY TO HAVE ONGOING REPERCUSSIONS FOR THIS IMPORTANT WETLAND’S ECOSYSTEMS. WE ARGUE THAT THE INCORPORATION OF AN ADEQUATE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE INTO MODELS FOR WETLAND MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION IS CRITICAL IN UNDERSTANDING HOW TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF ECOLOGICAL CATASTROPHES SUCH AS BIODIVERSITY LOSS. © 2021 NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.

MANY PROJECTS AIMED AT RECONCILING THE GOALS OF BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND SOCIAL ASPIRATIONS WITHIN PROTECTED AREAS (PAS) HAVE FAILED ON ONE OR BOTH COUNTS. HERE, WE INVESTIGATE THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF LIVING EITHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE SUSTAINABLE-USE PAS IN THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON, USING DATA FROM MORE THAN 100 LOCAL COMMUNITIES ALONG A 2,000-KM SECTION OF A MAJOR AMAZONIAN RIVER. THE PAS IN THIS REGION ARE NOW WIDELY VIEWED AS CONSERVATION TRIUMPHS, HAVING IMPLEMENTED COMMUNITY COMANAGEMENT OF FISHERIES AND RECOVERY OF OVEREXPLOITED WILDLIFE POPULATIONS. WE DOCUMENT CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL WELFARE IN COMMUNITIES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE PAS. SPECIFICALLY, COMMUNITIES INSIDE PAS ENJOY BETTER ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, ELECTRICITY, BASIC SANITATION, AND COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE. MOREOVER, LIVING WITHIN A PA WAS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF HOUSEHOLD WEALTH, FOLLOWED BY CASH-TRANSFER PROGRAMS AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PER HOUSEHOLD. THESE COLLECTIVE COBENEFITS CLEARLY INFLUENCE LIFE SATISFACTION, WITH ONLY 5% OF ALL ADULT RESIDENTS INSIDE PAS ASPIRING TO MOVE TO URBAN CENTERS, COMPARED WITH 58% OF ADULTS IN UNPROTECTED AREAS.

WITH FINITE RESOURCES AVAILABLE, AND A RAPIDLY NARROWING WINDOW, THE SCIENTIFIC AND POLICY COMMUNITIES HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENTIONS FOR CONSERVING THREATENED SPECIES. GIVEN THE RECENT EMPHASIS ON THE USE OF COUNTER WILDLIFE CRIME INTERVENTIONS (I.E. THOSE THAT DIRECTLY PROTECT WILDLIFE FROM ILLEGAL HARVEST, DETECT AND SANCTION RULE-BREAKERS, AND INTERDICT AND CONTROL ILLEGAL WILDLIFE COMMODITIES), THERE IS A CLEAR NEED TO SUMMARIZE THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON BIOLOGICAL AND THREAT REDUCTION OUTCOMES OF SUCH ACTIONS TO HELP MAKE EVIDENCE-INFORMED MANAGEMENT AND FUNDING DECISIONS. HERE, WE PRESENT A PROTOCOL FOR A SYSTEMATIC MAP THAT WILL COLLATE THE EXISTING BODY OF LITERATURE ADDRESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COUNTER-WILDLIFE CRIME INTERVENTIONS FOR PROTECTING TARGETED SPECIES. OUR FOCUS WILL BE ON SELECT SPECIES OR SPECIES GROUPS DIRECTLY THREATENED BY EXPLOITATION (I.E. ILLEGAL HARMING WHETHER BY HARVEST AS A RESOURCE OR FOR CONTROL/PERSECUTION) AND NATIVE TO AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA, WHICH ARE REGIONS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT WILDLIFE POPULATIONS DECLINES. THE SYSTEMATIC MAP WILL AIM TO CAPTURE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE FOUND IN COMMERCIALLY PUBLISHED AND GREY LITERATURE. WE WILL SEARCH FOR THE LITERATURE USING FOUR PUBLICATION DATABASES, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, 36 SPECIALIST WEBSITES AND DATABASES AND SOURCES IDENTIFIED THROUGH A CALL FOR EVIDENCE AMONG RELEVANT NETWORKS. ELIGIBILITY SCREENING WILL BE CONDUCTED AT TWO STAGES: (1) TITLE AND ABSTRACT AND (2) FULL TEXT. RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM INCLUDED PAPERS WILL BE EXTRACTED AND ENTERED INTO A SEARCHABLE, CODED DATABASE (MS-EXCEL). NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WILL DESCRIBE THE KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RELEVANT EVIDENCE BASE (E.G. GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, SPECIES, INTERVENTIONS, DIRECT THREATS, OUTCOMES AND STUDY DESIGNS). USING VISUAL HEAT MAPS, WE WILL IDENTIFY KEY KNOWLEDGE GAPS WARRANTING FURTHER RESEARCH AND CLUSTERS OF EVIDENCE THAT COULD SERVE AS TOPICS FOR FUTURE SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. THE RESULTING MAP WILL GUIDE FURTHER EXPLORATION ON EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COUNTER-WILDLIFE CRIME INTERVENTIONS, AND AID IN BUILDING AN EVIDENCE BASE THAT SUPPORTS BOTH MANAGEMENT AND FUNDING DECISIONS TO ENSURE EFFICIENT USE OF LIMITED RESOURCES AND MAXIMAL CONSERVATION BENEFITS. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

IDENTIFYING AND RECORDING COASTAL BIODIVERSITY IS ESSENTIAL TO ASSESS ECOSYSTEM HEALTH, CHANGES AND THE EXTENT OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS. COASTAL TROPICAL HABITATS SUCH AS CORAL REEFS AND SEAGRASS BEDS HAVE BEEN THE RESEARCH FOCUS FOR SCIENTISTS DURING THE LAST DECADES; HOWEVER, OTHER ECOSYSTEMS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED, SUCH AS MACROALGAE FORESTS, SUBTIDAL (20-30 M DEEP) SEDIMENTARY BOTTOMS, AND ROCKY REEFS. OBJECTIVE: OUR STUDY REPORTS THE MARINE BIODIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH ROCKY REEFS, CORAL REEFS, SARGASSUM FORESTS AND SEDIMENTARY SUBTIDAL BOTTOMS (20-30 M DEEP), IN A TROPICAL SEASONAL UPWELLING AREA (SANTA ELENA PENINSULA, SANTA ELENA BAY, AND MURCIÉLAGO ISLANDS, COSTA RICA). METHODS: DURING THE ‘SANTA ELENA EXPEDITION’ (APRIL 21-MAY 2 2018), A TOTAL OF 28 SITES WERE VISITED IN ORDER TO RECORD THE BIODIVERSITY ACROSS FOUR DIFFERENT HABITATS (ROCKY AND CORAL REEFS, SARGASSUM FORESTS, SUBTIDAL SEDIMENTARY BOTTOMS), USING SCUBA AND BOTH SYSTEMATIC SURVEYS AND VISUAL ASSESSMENTS; IN SOME SEDIMENTARY BOTTOMS A 20-MINUTE DREDGE TOWS WERE DONE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 254 TAXA WERE IDENTIFIED, BEING BONY FISHES THE MOST DIVERSE GROUP (91 SPECIES), FOLLOWED BY GASTROPODS (25 SPP.), RED ALGAE (21 SPP.) AND ANTHOZOANS (19 SPP.). WE REPORT FOUR NEW RECORDS FOR THE PACIFIC MAINLAND OF COSTA RICA, INCLUDING THE SUBCLASS OF TUBE-DWELLING SEA ANEMONE (CERIANTHARIA). CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT SANTA ELENA PENINSULA, SANTA ELENA BAY, AND MURCIÉLAGO ISLANDS HARBOR UNCOMMON AND UNSTUDIED HABITATS, SUCH AS SARGASSUM FORESTS, SEDIMENTARY BOTTOMS, REEFS CONSTRUCTED BY THE STONY CORAL PAVONA GIGANTEA –WHICH IS VERY UNUSUAL– AND ROCKY REEF COMMUNITIES DOMINATED BY CALCAREOUS COLONIES OF POLYCHAETES (SALMACINA TRIBRANCHIATA). © 2021, UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA.

MOREOVER, IT PROVIDES A PLETHORA OF ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS TO SOCIETY. NEVERTHELESS, THE KL IS SUFFERING FROM MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC STRESSORS THAT THREATEN THESE WETLANDS’ SUSTAINABILITY. THOUGH THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK ASSURES SUSTAINABLE CONSERVATION OF FISHERIES RESOURCES, THE IMPLEMENTATION SCENARIOS OF FISHERIES LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND POLICIES IN THE KL WETLAND ARE INSUFFICIENT. THIS STUDY AIMED AT ASSESSING THE FISHER’S PERCEPTION OF THE REGULATION IMPLEMENTATION EFFICIENCY OF THE PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION FISH ACT OF 1950, WHILE ANALYZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN THE CONTEXT OF BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND THE MANAGEMENT SUSTAINABILITY OF KL. BY INTEGRATING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA COLLECTED THROUGH PARTICIPATORY RURAL APPRAISAL (PRA) TOOLS VIZ. 225 INTERVIEWS WITH FISHERS, FOUR FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, AND 12 KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS, THE INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED IN FOUR SELECTED AREAS IN KL. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT FISHERS ROUTINELY DISREGARD LAWS AND RESTRICTIONS OF THE PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION OF FISH ACT 1950 DUE TO VARIOUS SOCIOECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FORCES. ALTHOUGH THE ANNUAL FISH HARVEST RATE FROM KL APPEARS TO BE INCREASING, THE LAKE IS LOSING ITS CHARISMATIC BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY PRIMARILY DUE TO INAPPROPRIATE AND INEFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF FISHING REGULATIONS. MANY FISHERS BELIEVE THAT THEY STILL FOLLOW THE ACT’S SIGNIFICANT LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHILE BEING INVOLVED IN SEVERAL DESTRUCTIVE AND PROHIBITED FISHING PRACTICES. THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN COMMUNITY AWARENESS, THE SCOPE OF THE ACT’S PROVISIONS, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS ENFORCEMENT, AND THE STRENGTH OF ITS EXECUTION. ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN THE KL IS INADEQUATE AND INEFFECTIVE FISHING REGULATIONS. IMPROVEMENT IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE FISHING ACT MAY BE THE PROMINENT OPTION TO ENSURE BETTER BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF THIS WETLAND. THIS RESULT CALLS FOR FUNCTIONAL AND POLICY ATTENTION TO REVISING THE REGULATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR SOCIOECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ELEMENTS CONTRIBUTING TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION.

HEREIN, WE INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF PREDATOR EXCLUSION ON RODENT COMMUNITIES AND THE SEROPREVALENCE OF HANTAVIRUSES WITHIN THE RESERVA NATURAL DEL BOSQUE MBARACAYÚ (RNBM), WHICH IS A PROTECTED AREA OF THE INTERIOR ATLANTIC FOREST (IAF). IN THE IAF, TWO SYMPATRIC RODENT RESERVOIRS, AKODON MONTENSIS AND OLIGORYZOMYS NIGRIPES, HARBOR JABORÁ AND JUQUITIBA HANTAVIRUS (JABV, JUQV), RESPECTIVELY. IN THIS STUDY, WE EMPLOYED TWO COMPLEMENTARY METHODS FOR PREDATOR EXCLUSION: COMPREHENSIVE FENCING AND TRAPPING/REMOVAL. THE GOAL OF EXCLUSION WAS TO PRECLUDE THE INFLUENCE OF PREDATION ON SMALL MAMMALS ON THE SAMPLING GRIDS AND THEREBY POTENTIALLY REDUCE RODENT MORTALITY. FOLLOWING BASELINE SAMPLING ON THREE GRID PAIRS WITH DIFFERENT HABITATS, WE CLOSED THE GRIDS AND BEGAN PREDATOR REMOVAL. BY SAMPLING THREE HABITAT TYPES, WE CONTROLLED FOR HABITAT-SPECIFIC EFFECTS, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR HANTAVIRUS–RESERVOIR DYNAMICS IN NEOTROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS. OUR SIX-MONTH PREDATOR EXCLUSION EXPERIMENT REVEALED THAT THE EXCLUSION OF TERRESTRIAL MAMMALIAN PREDATORS HAD LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE RODENT COMMUNITY OR THE POPULATION DYNAMICS OF A. MONTENSIS AND O. NIGRIPES. INSTEAD, FLUCTUATIONS IN SPECIES DIVERSITY AND SPECIES ABUNDANCES WERE INFLUENCED BY SAMPLING SESSION AND FOREST DEGRADATION.

WE INVESTIGATED HWC BY INTERVIEWING 498 RESPONDENTS FROM 42 VILLAGES IN NOWSHERA DISTRICT, PAKISTAN. ACCORDING TO RESPONDENTS, SIX SPECIES—THE COMMON LEOPARD (PANTHERA PARDUS), GREY WOLF (CANIS LUPUS), GOLDEN JACKAL (CANIS AUREUS), RED FOX (VULPES VULPES), INDIAN PORCUPINE (HYSTRIX INDICA), AND WILD BOAR (SUS SCROFA)—WERE INVOLVED IN LIVESTOCK PREDATION AND CROP-RAIDING. LIVESTOCK PREDATION (N = 670) TRANSLATED INTO A TOTAL ANNUAL ECONOMIC LOSS OF USD 48,490 ACROSS THE 42 VILLAGES, WITH THE HIGHEST ECONOMIC LOSS OF USD 57.1/HOUSEHOLD/YEAR ATTRIBUTED TO THE GOLDEN JACKAL. CROP DAMAGE BY WILD BOAR AND PORCUPINE INCURRED A TOTAL ANNUAL ECONOMIC LOSS OF USD 18,000. RESULTS FURTHER SHOWED THAT LIVESTOCK PREDATION WAS HIGHLY AFFECTED BY LOCATION, PREY TYPE, PREY AGE, AND HERDING PRACTICES, WHILE CEREALS AND VEGETABLES WERE PREFERRED CROPS FOR WILD BOAR AND INDIAN PORCUPINE. THE GREY WOLF WAS DECLARED AS THE MOST DANGEROUS CARNIVORE, FOLLOWED BY THE GOLDEN JACKAL AND COMMON LEOPARD. NEGATIVE ATTITUDE ABOUT GOLDEN JACKAL AND WILD BOAR PREVAILS AMONG 90% OF THE RESPONDENTS OF THE STUDY AREA. WE STRONGLY ASSUME THAT THE ABUNDANCE OF APEX PREDATORS CAN CONTROL THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF MESO-CARNIVORES AND WILD BOAR ON THE COMMUNITY’S LIVELIHOOD. KEEPING RELATIVELY SMALLER HERDS MAY REDUCE CARNIVORE ATTACKS AND EDUCATING THE POPULOUS AND COMPENSATION CAN MINIMISE NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF HWC. TO REDUCE HWC IN THE STUDY AREA, THERE SHOULD BE AN INCESSANT AND TIMELY COORDINATION BETWEEN WILDLIFE OFFICIALS AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

HOWEVER, COMMUNITY-BASED CONSERVATION’S EFFICACY AND IMPACT IN SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT VARIES DEPENDING ON NATIONAL NATURAL RESOURCE POLICIES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR LOCAL INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN ON THE MANAGEMENT OF COMMON POOL RESOURCES (CPRS), BY COMPARING NAMIBIAN CONSERVANCIES AND COMMUNITY FORESTS. TO MEET THIS AIM, WE REVIEWED KEY NATIONAL POLICIES PERTINENT TO NATURAL RESOURCE GOVERNANCE AND CONDUCTED 28 SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS BETWEEN 2012 AND 2013. KEY INFORMANTS INCLUDED CONSERVANCY AND COMMUNITY FOREST STAFF AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS, VILLAGE HEADMEN, NGO COORDINATORS, REGIONAL FORESTERS, WILDLIFE OFFICIALS (WARDENS), AND SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT AND TOURISM AND THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, WATER AND FORESTRY. WE EXPLORED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: HOW DO NATIONAL NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT POLICIES AFFECT THE OPERATIONS OF LOCAL COMMON POOL RESOURCE INSTITUTIONS? AND HOW DO EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECT LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN CPRS DECISION-MAKING? OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT A DIVERSITY OF NATIONAL POLICIES SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED LOCAL INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. FORMATION OF CONSERVANCIES AND COMMUNITY FORESTS BY COMMUNITIES IS NOT ONLY DIRECTLY LINKED WITH STATE POLICIES DESIGNED TO INCREASE WILDLIFE NUMBERS AND PROMOTE FOREST GROWTH OR IMPROVE CONDITION, BUT ALSO FORMULATED PRIMARILY FOR BENEFITS FROM AND CONTROL OVER NATURAL RESOURCES. THE OFTEN-ASSUMED DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NATIONAL POLICIES AND LOCAL INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS DOES NOT ALWAYS HOLD IN PRACTICE, RESULTING IN INSTITUTIONAL MISMATCH.

RESULTS INDICATE THAT REMOVAL IS INDEED EFFECTIVE AS A CONTROL TECHNIQUE; HOWEVER, AS INVADERS HAVE HIGH REGENERATION CAPABILITIES AND RECRUITMENT RATES, SUCCESSIVE MANAGEMENT EFFORTS ARE ESSENTIAL. IN ORDER FOR MANAGEMENT TO BE EFFECTIVE AGAINST TUBASTRAEA'S YEAR-ROUND RELEASE OF CLONAL LARVAE, RESULTS SUGGEST INVADED AREAS SHOULD RECEIVE AT LEAST TWO MANAGEMENT ACTIONS PER YEAR.

THIS DISCREPANCY REFLECTS THE PRESENCE OF PROTECTED AREAS ON LANDS AVAILABLE INSTEAD OF THE ECOLOGICAL, EVOLUTIONARY, OR CONSERVATION VALUES OF SPECIES PRESENT. HABITAT LOSS CONSEQUENTLY CONTINUES TO IMPACT THREATENED SPECIES, AS ILLUSTRATED BY GEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS FOR AMPHIBIANS. GIVEN THE NEED TO BETTER ALIGN THE BOUNDARIES OF PROTECTED AREAS WITH AT-RISK BIODIVERSITY, WE ASSESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS FACTORS FOR IDENTIFYING GLOBAL AND BIOME-LEVEL CONSERVATION PRIORITY AREAS, SPECIFICALLY FOR AMPHIBIANS. WE IDENTIFIED, MAPPED, AND RANKED AREAS OF CRITICAL CONSERVATION IMPORTANCE FOR ALL AMPHIBIAN SPECIES ON EARTH USING A NEW INTEGRATIVE TOOL THAT SCORES THE URGENCY OF CONSERVING EACH SPECIES AND LOCATION BASED ON A COMBINATION OF SPECIES CHARACTERISTICS AND ECOREGION-LEVEL HUMAN IMPACTS. OUR INTEGRATIVE APPROACH IS NOVEL IN THAT IT ACCOUNTS FOR LIKELY THREATS TO DATA DEFICIENT SPECIES, CONSIDERS THE IRREPLACEABILITY OF UNIQUE SPECIES THAT ARE PHYLOGENETICALLY ISOLATED, AND ADDRESSES THE LOCALIZED CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS OF SPECIES ENDEMICITY AND PROJECTED FUTURE HUMAN IMPACTS TO AN ECOREGION. FOR COMPARISON, WE ALSO MAPPED AND RANKED AMPHIBIAN BIODIVERSITY USING SPECIES RICHNESS AND AN EVOLUTIONARILY DISTINCT AND GLOBALLY ENDANGERED (EDGE) SCORE PROXY. OUR INTEGRATIVE APPROACH PREDICTED KEY REGIONS FOR AMPHIBIAN CONSERVATION THAT WERE NOT APPARENT WHEN USING A SIMPLE SPECIES RICHNESS OR EDGE SCORE PROXY-BASED APPROACH. FURTHERMORE, BY SCALING CONSERVATION PRIORITY SCORES RELATIVE TO BIOME, WE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL TEMPERATE AND XERIC REGIONS OF CRUCIAL YET OVERLOOKED CONSERVATION IMPORTANCE FOR AMPHIBIANS. UNTIL GLOBAL AMPHIBIAN DIVERSITY IS THOROUGHLY CATALOGUED, WE RECOMMEND USING OUR INTEGRATIVE SCORING APPROACH TO SET GEOGRAPHIC PRIORITIES FOR AMPHIBIAN HABITAT PROTECTION, WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS APPROACH MAY BE COMPLEMENTED BY OTHERS (E.G., EDGE SCORES).

FORESTS ARE CRUCIAL IN MAINTAINING BIODIVERSITY AND MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE. APART FROM CONTINUING DEFORESTATION, FORESTS ALSO FACE INCREASING PRESSURE FROM LIVESTOCK GRAZING IN THE SYSTEM, WHICH IS LESS UNDERSTOOD COMPARED TO GRASSLANDS. THROUGH A META-ANALYSIS OF 156 ARTICLES WITH 1936 DATA ENTRIES, THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE EFFECT OF LIVESTOCK ON FOREST BIODIVERSITY, STRUCTURE, AND FUNCTIONS, VARYING WITH LIVESTOCK TYPES, LIVESTOCK DENSITY, GRAZING HISTORY, AND CLIMATIC FACTORS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT LIVESTOCK OVERALL HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE FOREST STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS, REDUCED SPECIES ABUNDANCE BUT INCREASED RICHNESS. MEDIUM AND LARGE MAMMALS, PLANT COMMUNITIES, AND SOIL WERE MORE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED COMPARED TO OTHER GROUPS SUCH AS BIRDS AND INVERTEBRATES. LIVESTOCK ALSO INFLUENCED THE ROLE OF FORESTS IN MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY CHANGED FOREST CARBON STOCK BY REDUCING PLANT BIOMASS; HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE SOIL CARBON STOCK OR SOIL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. ECOSYSTEM ATTRIBUTES WERE MORE AFFECTED IN WARMER AND DRIER REGIONS AND BY SINGLE SPECIES GRAZING THAN THE MIXED GRAZING. PAST LIVESTOCK GRAZING HISTORY MODERATES THE IMPACTS OF LIVESTOCK, WITH THE STRONGEST NEGATIVE EFFECT OCCURRED WITH A HISTORY OF 1–5 YEARS. NONETHELESS, LIVESTOCK ACTIVITIES ALSO HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON FOREST MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS REDUCING FOREST FLAMMABILITY. OUR RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THE LACK OF STUDIES ON HOW HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS RESPOND TO LIVESTOCK DISTURBANCES AND HOW GRAZING INTENSITY MODERATES THE EFFECT, WHICH INCLUDES GRAZING DURATION AND LIVESTOCK DENSITY.

ECOL.,1,"CONTEXT: THE CURRENT BIODIVERSITY CRISIS HAS INTENSIFIED THE NEED TO PREDICT SPECIES RESPONSES TO LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION AND HAS RENEWED ATTENTION ON THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF WHAT INFLUENCES THE DYNAMICS OF SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS. LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION CAN AFFECT TWO MAIN COMPONENTS THAT DICTATE DISTRIBUTIONS: HABITAT SUITABILITY AND HABITAT CONNECTIVITY. ELUCIDATING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THESE FACTORS AND ASSOCIATED LANDSCAPE FEATURES CAN HELP PRIORITIZE MANAGEMENT ACTION FOR SPECIES CONSERVATION. OBJECTIVES: OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO USE SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS AND NETWORK-BASED LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY MODELS TO UNDERSTAND WHICH LANDSCAPE FACTORS WERE MOST PREDICTIVE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF AN ANURAN, BLANCHARD’S CRICKET FROG (ACRIS BLANCHARDI), IN AN AGRICULTURALLY-DOMINATED LANDSCAPE. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED OUR STUDY IN OHIO, USA, NEAR THE EDGE OF THE CRICKET FROG’S CONTRACTING RANGE. TO OBTAIN A CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF CRICKET FROG DISTRIBUTION, WE SURVEYED 367 POND AND STREAM LOCATIONS ACROSS THREE NORTH–SOUTH TRANSECTS. WE THEN TESTED SEVEN REGRESSION MODELS, COMBINING HABITAT SUITABILITY AND LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY METRICS, TO DETERMINE WHICH FACTORS BEST PREDICTED CRICKET FROG PRESENCE. RESULTS: WE DETECTED CRICKET FROGS IN 24% OF SURVEYED LOCATIONS AND THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUPY POND SITES THAN STREAM SITES. CRICKET FROG PRESENCE WAS BEST PREDICTED BY MODELS WITH HABITAT SUITABILITY AND THE NUMBER OF INTERCONNECTED HABITAT PATCHES. WE FOUND THAT, WHILE THERE WAS HIGH VARIATION IN HABITAT SUITABILITY ACROSS THE STUDY AREA, LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY WAS RELATIVELY UNIFORM WHERE WE SURVEYED. CONCLUSIONS: AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES AROUND THE WORLD ARE OFTEN MOSAICS OF LAND COVER TYPES, WHICH MAY FUNCTIONALLY PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY FOR SOME SPECIES. IN SUCH AREAS, CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT SHOULD FOCUS ON PRESERVING AND RESTORING REGIONS OF HIGHLY SUITABLE HABITAT. THIS FOCUS MAY BE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR SPECIES THAT DO NOT APPEAR TO BE DISPERSAL LIMITED AND, THEREFORE, ABLE TO MAINTAIN METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS. © 2021, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER NATURE B.V.",NA,NA,LAECE,"YOUNGQUIST, M.B.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY, 1200 SOUTH LAKE SHORE DRIVE, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: MYOUNGQUIST@SHEDDAQUARIUM.ORG",ARTICLE,10.1007/s10980-021-01295-7,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, 1406814",9212973,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,3,10,2795-2809,SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,MAKING THE CONNECTION: COMBINING HABITAT SUITABILITY AND LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY TO UNDERSTAND SPECIES DISTRIBUTION IN AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110429162&doi=10.1007%2fs10980-021-01295-7&partnerID=40&md5=7e32ea7ce39cf45494114dd59019fc2a,36,2021,"FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT WAS PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION DOCTORAL DISSERTATION IMPROVEMENT GRANT (DDIG) TO MBY.

IN INTENSIVELY USED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, PATCHES OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS AND PARTICULARLY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM ARE OF HIGH IMPORTANCE FOR MANY TAXA. VEGETATED CONNECTIONS LIKE HEDGEROWS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR FORAGING AND COMMUTING OF MOBILE TAXA SUCH AS BATS. HOWEVER, THE INTEREST OF ANOTHER TREELESS LINEAR HABITAT – HERBACEOUS FIELD MARGINS – REMAINS UNSTUDIED FOR INSECTIVOROUS BATS. FIELD MARGINS ARE NEVERTHELESS KNOWN AS AN IMPORTANT HABITAT FOR OTHER TAXA, INCLUDING BAT PREY. HERE WE ASSESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF FIELD MARGINS FOR BATS COMPARED TO OTHER LANDSCAPE VARIABLES. WE MEASURED BAT ACTIVITY BASED ON A REPEATED PASSIVE ACOUSTIC MONITORING DURING 17 COMPLETE NIGHTS IN SUMMER ON 112 STUDY SITES IN AN INTENSIVELY USED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE. EACH NIGHT, WE SAMPLED BAT SPECIES ACTIVITY AND COMMUNITY METRICS (I.E. SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMMUNITY HABITAT SPECIALIZATION INDEX) AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES TO FIELD MARGINS, AND ALONG A GRADIENT OF RELATIVE DENSITY OF FIELD MARGINS. TO COMPARE FIELD MARGIN EFFECTS WITH OTHER LANDSCAPE VARIABLES, THE SAMPLED SITES WERE SELECTED BY KEEPING A LARGE VARIABILITY IN THESE OTHER VARIABLES (LAND-COVER SHANNON DIVERSITY INDEX, FORESTS, HEDGEROWS, WATER BODIES, MAIN ROADS, URBAN AREAS, GRASSLANDS, NUMBER OF CROPS AND RAPESEED PERCENTAGE). ONLY MYOTIS SP. WERE AFFECTED BY HERBACEOUS FIELD MARGINS. SPECIFICALLY, THE MYOTIS GROUP ACTIVITY DECREASED WITH THE DISTANCE TO HERBACEOUS FIELD MARGINS (I.E. TOWARDS FIELD CROP CORES), AND POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH RELATIVE DENSITY OF HERBACEOUS FIELD MARGINS, FOR WHICH THE EFFECT SIZE WAS COMPARABLE TO OTHER LANDSCAPE VARIABLES. HOWEVER, OTHER LANDSCAPE VARIABLES SUCH AS THE PROPORTION OF AND THE DISTANCE TO FORESTS, THE RELATIVE DENSITY OF AND THE DISTANCE TO HEDGEROWS OR LAND-COVER SHANNON DIVERSITY INDEX, AFFECTED SPECIES RICHNESS, COMMUNITY SPECIALIZATION INDEX, AND BAT ACTIVITY OF SPECIES FROM OPEN, EDGE AND NARROW-SPACE FORAGERS, INCLUDING THE MYOTIS GROUP AS WELL. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THAT HERBACEOUS FIELD MARGINS HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE ACTIVITY OF NARROW-SPACE BAT FORAGERS AS MYOTIS SPECIES, BUT DO NOT REPLACE OTHER LANDSCAPE VARIABLES THAT DRIVE THE ACTIVITY OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. © 2021 ELSEVIER B.V.",107494,NA,AEEND,"BARRÉ, K.; CENTRE D′ECOLOGIE ET DES SCIENCES DE LA CONSERVATION (CESCO), CP 135, 57 RUE CUVIER, FRANCE; EMAIL: KEVIN.BARRE@EDU.MNHN.FR",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.agee.2021.107494,"FONDATION POUR LA RECHERCHE SUR LA BIODIVERSITEFONDATION POUR LA RECHERCHE SUR LA BIODIVERSITE, FRB",1678809,"AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT",ENGLISH,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,ASSESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF FIELD MARGINS FOR BAT SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES IN INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110370699&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2021.107494&partnerID=40&md5=9aea593ed26adb56a5d13b7b346e1163,319,2021,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY DIM ASTREA GRANTS FROM REGION ILE-DE-FRANCE (FRANCE) AND BY THE FONDATION POUR LA RECHERCHE SUR LA BIODIVERSITÉ (FRANCE).

VARIATION IN EDGE RESPONSES MAY BE DRIVEN BY LUMPING SPECIALISTS AND GENERALISTS WITH DIVERGENT RESPONSES. OBJECTIVES: WE EXAMINED ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH A HABITAT EDGE IN AN INTERTIDAL SALT MARSH IN NEW JERSEY. WE PREDICTED THAT HERBIVORES, LARGELY SPECIALISTS, WOULD DECLINE ALONG THE HABITAT EDGE DUE TO THEIR FAILURE TO EXPAND ACROSS THE BOUNDARY, AND SPECIALIST NATURAL ENEMIES SHOULD TRACK PREY. GENERALISTS SHOULD BE LESS IMPACTED BY THE EDGE IF THEY USE RESOURCES FROM BOTH SIDES. THUS, HABITAT EDGES SHOULD AFFECT SPECIES COMPOSITION MORE THAN SPECIES DIVERSITY. METHODS: WE STUDIED THE EDGE RESPONSES OF 115 ARTHROPOD SPECIES TO THE HABITAT EDGE FORMED BETWEEN SPARTINA PATENS (SP) AND SPARTINA ALTERNIFLORA (SA) THROUGHOUT THE GROWING SEASON. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT THE EDGE BETWEEN SA AND SP AFFECTED THE ABUNDANCE AND COMPOSITION OF THE ASSOCIATED ARTHROPOD COMMUNITY, BUT NOT SPECIES RICHNESS. COMPOSITION OF HERBIVORES, EPIGEIC FEEDERS, SPECIALIST NATURAL ENEMIES, AND GENERALIST PREDATORS SHIFTED NOT ONLY BETWEEN SA AND SP INTERIORS, BUT ALSO THE EDGES. COMPOSITIONAL SHIFTS WERE DRIVEN BY DIETARY OR HABITAT SPECIALISTS. CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND THAT EDGES CHANGE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION VIA DIVERGENT RESPONSES BY SPECIES WITH DIFFERENT RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS. THIS CHANGE IN COMPOSITION IS NOT BETWEEN TWO DISPARATE HABITAT TYPES BUT TWO CONGENERIC GRASS SPECIES.

UPLAND GRASSLAND SOILS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY INTENSIFICATION INCLUDING DRAINAGE, ARTIFICIAL FERTILISER USE, COMPACTION AND EROSION WHILE THE EFFECT OF AES MANAGEMENT ON BELOW-GROUND MICROARTHROPODS, WHICH MEDIATE A RANGE OF ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES, IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. THIS STUDY TESTED THE EFFECTS OF AES MANAGEMENT OF UPLAND GRASSLANDS ON MICROARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES USING A LARGE-SCALE FACTORIAL FIELD EXPERIMENT. THE STUDY FOCUSED ON MICROARTHROPODS WITH DISTINCT TAXA-SPECIFIC RESPONSES OBSERVED. ORIBATID MITE ABUNDANCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH WETTER, MORE EXTENSIVE PASTURES WITH NATIVE GRASSES CHARACTERISTIC OF SEMI-IMPROVED GRASSLAND MANAGED BY AESS, WHEREAS COLLEMBOLA ABUNDANCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DRIER, MORE INTENSE, RESEEDED (LOLIUM PERENNE DOMINATED) PASTURES CHARACTERISTIC OF CONVENTIONALLY MANAGED IMPROVED GRASSLANDS.

THERE WAS NO NET EFFECT OF MANAGEMENT, HABITAT OR THEIR INTERACTION ON TOTAL MICROARTHROPOD FAMILY DIVERSITY OR ABUNDANCE. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT IN FLORISTICALLY SIMPLE UPLAND AGROECOSYSTEMS THE IMPACT OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENT MEASURES ON BELOW-GROUND SOIL BIOTA ARE CONTEXT-DEPENDENT (DIFFERING BETWEEN CONTRASTING GRASSLAND TYPES), AND TAXA-SPECIFIC, RATHER THAN LEADING TO GENERAL INCREASES IN BIODIVERSITY PER SE, AND THE RESPONSES OF SOIL MICROARTHROPODS ARE DRIVEN BY ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION CAUSED BY OVERALL MANAGEMENT OF GRASSLAND FIELDS.

WE DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY TO BUILD A 500+ FOOD ITEM, NUTRIENT, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT DATABASE SPECIFIC TO A GIVEN COUNTRY AND MONTH, WHICH INCLUDES SEVERAL LIFE CYCLE STAGES OF A FOOD ITEM AND CALCULATES IMPACTS DEPENDING ON FROM WHERE THE ITEM IS SOURCED. THIS DATABASE IS THEN USED TO DEVELOP A DETAILED AND PERSONALIZED, HEALTHFUL, LOW IMPACT DIET BY USING LINEAR OPTIMIZATION.

UNDERSTANDING THE DRIVERS OF JAGUAR KILLING, TRADE AND CONSUMPTION IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE JAGUAR CONSERVATION STRATEGIES, PARTICULARLY AS DEMAND FOR JAGUAR PRODUCTS APPEARS TO BE RISING DUE TO CHINESE DEMAND. WE INTERVIEWED 1107 RURAL HOUSEHOLDS IN NORTH-WESTERN BOLIVIA, AN AREA WITH AN ACTIVE HISTORY OF HUMAN–JAGUAR CONFLICT, WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN AT THE EPICENTRE OF RECENT JAGUAR TRADE CASES. WE COLLECTED INFORMATION ON PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES WITH JAGUARS, THEIR JAGUAR KILLING, TRADING AND CONSUMING BEHAVIOURS AND POTENTIAL DRIVERS OF THESE BEHAVIOURS.

SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING (SRS) DATA SETS ON GLOBAL ECOSYSTEM DISTRIBUTIONS AND FUNCTIONING SHOW EXCITING POTENTIAL FOR INFORMING RANGE-BASED RLS ASSESSMENT, BUT THEIR INCORPORATION HAS BEEN RESTRICTED BY LOW TEMPORAL RESOLUTION AND COVERAGE OF DATA SETS, LACK OF INCORPORATION OF DEGRADATION-DRIVEN HABITAT LOSS, AND NONINCLUSION OF ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO IDENTIFICATION OF CHANGING HABITAT DISTRIBUTIONS FOR TAXA WITH VARYING HABITAT DEPENDENCY AND ECOLOGIES. FOR POORLY KNOWN MANGROVE-ASSOCIATED CUBAN HUTIAS (MESOCAPROMYS SPP.), WE TESTED THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THESE ISSUES ON RANGE-BASED RLS ASSESSMENT OUTCOMES.

WE FOUND EXTENSIVE VARIATION IN SIMULATED SPECIES-SPECIFIC RANGE-BASED RLS ASSESSMENTS, AND THIS VARIATION WAS MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIME SERIES OVER WHICH PARAMETERS WERE ESTIMATED. HOWEVER, RESULTS OF SOME SPECIES-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENTS DIFFERED BY UP TO 3 CATEGORIES (NEAR THREATENED TO CRITICALLY ENDANGERED) WITHIN THE SAME TIME SERIES, DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF INCORPORATING HABITAT QUALITY AND THE SPATIAL SCALING USED IN RLS PARAMETER ESTIMATION. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL APPROACH TO INCORPORATING SRS INFORMATION IN RLS ASSESSMENT IS INAPPROPRIATE, AND WE URGE CAUTION IN CONDUCTING RANGE-BASED ASSESSMENTS WITH SRS FOR SPECIES FOR WHICH HABITAT DEPENDENCE ON SPECIFIC ECOSYSTEM TYPES IS INCOMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD.

MANAGE.,0,"HABITAT DISTURBANCE AND PARTICULARLY LAND-USE CHANGE FROM NATURAL HABITATS TO FOREST PLANTATIONS, CROPLANDS, AND URBAN EXPANSION HAVE CAUSED A RAPID BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA'S TEMPERATE RAINFORESTS. IN THOSE FORESTS, BRYOPHYTES CONSTITUTE A CRUCIAL COMPONENT, WITH IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM ROLES. WE EVALUATED BRYOPHYTE DIVERSITY AND SPECIES TURNOVER BETWEEN NATIVE TEMPERATE FORESTS AND SITES WITH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF DISTURBANCE TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO HOW HABITAT DISTURBANCE AFFECTS THE BRYOPHYTE COMMUNITY. WE USED FOUR DIFFERENT HABITAT DISTURBANCE SCENARIOS AT A TEMPERATE RAINFOREST, COMPRISING PRIMARY NATIVE FORESTS, SECONDARY FORESTS, CLEAR-CUT AREAS, AND ABANDONED EUCALYPTUS FOREST PLANTATIONS. WE SAMPLED BRYOPHYTES FOR THREE YEARS (2016 TO 2018) ON FOUR SUBSTRATES (ROCK, SOIL, LIVE WOOD, AND DEADWOOD). WE FOUND THAT SPECIES RICHNESS DECREASES, AND TURNOVER INCREASES AS DISTURBANCE INCREASES. LIVERWORTS WERE MORE SENSITIVE TO HABITAT DISTURBANCE THAN MOSSES, REACHING THEIR HIGHEST DIVERSITY IN PRIMARY FORESTS. SUBSTRATE AVAILABILITY WAS ALSO A KEY FACTOR FOR THE BRYOPHYTE COMMUNITY, AS SPECIES WERE NON-RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THEM. IN CONCLUSION, HABITAT DISTURBANCE AFFECTS THE TEMPERATE FOREST BRYOPHYTE COMMUNITY, ALTERING ITS COMPOSITION ALONG WITH DISTURBANCE CONDITIONS. CONSIDERING THE CRUCIAL ROLES THAT BRYOPHYTES PLAY WITHIN THE ECOSYSTEM, THESE CHANGES CAN ALSO AFFECT BIRD AND MAMMAL SPECIES THAT USE THEM AS NESTING MATERIAL. © 2021 ELSEVIER B.V.",119467,NA,FECMD,"RIFFO-DONOSO, V.; DEPARTAMENTO DE CIENCIAS ECOLÓGICAS, CHILE; EMAIL: VRIFFODONOSO@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119467,"FONDO NACIONAL DE DESARROLLO CIENTÍFICO Y TECNOLÓGICOFONDO NACIONAL DE DESARROLLO CIENTÍFICO Y TECNOLÓGICO, FONDECYT, 11160152",3781127,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,"HABITAT DISTURBANCE ALTERS SPECIES RICHNESS, COMPOSITION, AND TURNOVER OF THE BRYOPHYTE COMMUNITY IN A TEMPERATE RAINFOREST",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108282927&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2021.119467&partnerID=40&md5=dc1c231b31973e340fd1588206826c10,496,2021,"WE ARE GRATEFUL TO CRISTOBAL VALENZUELA, FELIPE ZAMORANO, GLORIA RODRÍGUEZ, AND IGNACIO ORELLANA FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE IN THE FIELD.

THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A GROWING INTEREST IN SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS ORGANIC FARMING. UNTIL NOW, STUDIES ADDRESSING THE IMPACT OF CONVENTIONAL AND ORGANIC MANAGEMENT ON SOIL BIODIVERSITY AND FUNCTIONING HAVE MAINLY FOCUSED ON ARABLE FARMING AND ONLY A FEW REPORTS ARE AVAILABLE ON VEGETABLE PRODUCTION. VEGETABLE FARMING IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST, SINCE MANAGEMENT INTENSITY IS USUALLY VERY HIGH AND THERE IS AN INCREASING DEMAND FOR VEGETABLE PRODUCTS. SOIL NEMATODES ARE USEFUL INDICATORS OF MANAGEMENT INTENSITY ON SOIL ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING BECAUSE THEY OCCUPY SEVERAL TROPHIC LEVELS IN SOIL MICRO-FOOD WEBS AND PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN NUTRIENT CYCLING, PEST SUPPRESSION, AND THE REGULATION OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES. IN THIS STUDY, WE ASSESSED THE IMPACT OF MANAGEMENT INTENSITY AND FARMING SYSTEM ON THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONAL GUILDS OF SOIL NEMATODES, COMPARING 20 CONVENTIONAL VEGETABLE FIELDS, 20 ORGANIC VEGETABLE FIELDS, AND 20 EXTENSIVE GRASSLANDS IN SWITZERLAND, ANALYZING OVER 30'000 NEMATODE INDIVIDUALS AND DETECTING 98 DIFFERENT NEMATODE GENERA. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION ACROSS THREE FARMING SYSTEMS. EXTENSIVE GRASSLANDS CONTAINED THE HIGHEST NEMATODE ABUNDANCE, FOLLOWED BY ORGANIC VEGETABLE FIELDS, AND CONVENTIONAL VEGETABLE FIELDS, INDICATING A DECLINE DUE TO LAND-USE INTENSIFICATION. ORGANIC FARMING LED TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE ABUNDANCE OF HERBIVORES (+82%), BACTERIVORES (+206%) AND OMNIVORES (+135%) IN COMPARISON WITH CONVENTIONAL FARMING. ORGANIC MANAGEMENT ALSO ENHANCED COMPOSITE (+195%) AND HERBIVORES (+451%) FOOTPRINTS, SUGGESTING GREATER CARBON AND ENERGY ENRICHMENT IN SOIL FOOD WEB THROUGH THESE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF SOIL NEMATODES VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS THE THREE FARMING SYSTEMS, WITH EACH FARMING SYSTEM FOSTERING SPECIFIC INDICATOR TAXA. IN CONCLUSION, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT FARMING SYSTEM HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON SOIL NEMATODE COMMUNITIES WITH INCREASING NEMATODE POPULATIONS UNDER ORGANIC VEGETABLE FARMING. ALTHOUGH ORGANIC VEGETABLE PRODUCTION MAY BENEFIT FROM ENHANCED SOIL FERTILITY DUE TO INCREASED POPULATION DENSITIES OF MICROBE FEEDING AND OMNIVOROUS NEMATODES, THE THREAT FROM PLANT PARASITIC NEMATODES TO VEGETABLE PRODUCTION REQUIRES ATTENTION AND CONTROL STRATEGIES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED FURTHER. © 2021 THE AUTHORS",107488,NA,AEEND,"YANG, B.; PLANT-SOIL-INTERACTIONS, RECKENHOLZSTRASSE 191, SWITZERLAND; EMAIL: XINYUAN890@163.COM; BANERJEE, S.; PLANT-SOIL-INTERACTIONS, RECKENHOLZSTRASSE 191, SWITZERLAND; EMAIL: BANERJEE.SOILMICRO@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.agee.2021.107488,"SCHWEIZERISCHER NATIONALFONDS ZUR FÖRDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTLICHEN FORSCHUNGSCHWEIZERISCHER NATIONALFONDS ZUR FÖRDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTLICHEN FORSCHUNG, SNF, 16607 CHINA SCHOLARSHIP COUNCILCHINA SCHOLARSHIP COUNCIL, CSC, 201604910484",1678809,"AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT",ENGLISH,NA,NA,7,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,"IMPACT OF LAND USE TYPE AND ORGANIC FARMING ON THE ABUNDANCE, DIVERSITY, COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF SOIL NEMATODE COMMUNITIES IN VEGETABLE FARMING",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107695769&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2021.107488&partnerID=40&md5=24abffe6783de4786109b4f2c7c8dca3,318,2021,"THIS STUDY WAS SUPPORTED BY THE STATE SCHOLARSHIP FUND OF THE CHINESE SCHOLARSHIP COUNCIL AWARDED TO DR.

POECILLA RETICULATA SHOWED RESISTANCE TO SALINITY UP TO A CONDUCTIVITY OF 25.2 MS/CM, AND NO LETHAL EFFECTS WERE RECORDED FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL IN THE TEST POPULATION. THE STUDY SHOWED THAT WINTER SALINITIES RECORDED IN INLAND WATERS (WITHOUT EMERGENCIES SUCH AS SUDDEN INFLUX OF POLLUTANTS DUE TO INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS) ARE UNLIKELY TO AFFECT FISH BUT MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO SMALL PLANKTON. HOWEVER, THE HIGH DARE OF D. MAGNA MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF PLANKTIVOROUS FISH. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS. LICENSEE MDPI, BASEL, SWITZERLAND.

THOUGHT TO ORIGINATE IN ASIA, B. DENDROBATIDIS NOW HAS A GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION, LIKELY DUE TO HUMAN MOVEMENT AND TRADE. THE PATHOGEN HAS YET TO BE DETECTED IN MELANESIA, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN FEW SURVEYS FOR B.

ALL FROGS TESTED NEGATIVE FOR THE PATHOGEN BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PATHOGEN IS PRESENT DESPITE NON-DETECTION, SO FURTHER SURVEYS FOR THE PATHOGEN ARE NEEDED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. DESPITE THIS, IT IS SAFEST TO TAKE A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH AND ASSUME THAT B. DENDROBATIDIS HAS NOT YET BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE SOLOMON ISLANDS, AND THAT NAÏVE NATIVE AMPHIBIAN POPULATIONS MAY BE AT RISK OF DECLINE IF THE PATHOGEN IS INTRODUCED. PROTOCOLS ARE NEEDED TO PREVENT THE ACCIDENTAL IMPORT OF INFECTED FROGS VIA TOURISM OR IN LOGGING OR MINING EQUIPMENT. MONITORING OF FROG POPULATIONS NEAR AREAS OF HIGH RISK SUCH AS PORTS IS ALSO RECOMMENDED.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF HABITAT TRANSFORMATION ON TAXONOMIC, FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY IN AFROTROPICAL BIRD COMMUNITIES. LOCATION: NYUNGWE LANDSCAPE, A MONTANE RAINFOREST WITH ADJOINING FARMLAND IN SOUTH-WEST RWANDA. METHODS: DATA ON BIRD OCCURRENCE, ABUNDANCE AND FUNCTIONAL TRAITS WERE COLLECTED IN 2017/18 USING POINT COUNTS. WE ALSO COLLECTED DATA ON HABITAT AND MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS FOR ALL BIRD SPECIES RECORDED. WE QUANTIFIED BIRD DIVERSITY USING A RANGE OF METRICS, INCLUDING THE INVERSE SIMPSON INDEX, FUNCTIONAL DISPERSION AND THE STANDARDIZED EFFECT SIZE OF MEAN NEAREST TAXON DISTANCE. RESULTS: IN COMPARISON WITH PRIMARY FOREST AREAS, EVEN LOW LEVELS OF LAND USE CHANGE ALTERED SPECIES COMPOSITION AND REDUCED SPECIES DIVERSITY. ALTHOUGH OVERALL FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY WERE SIMILAR ACROSS LAND USE TYPES, WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTION OF TROPHIC AND LOCOMOTORY TRAIT STRUCTURES OF BIRD COMMUNITIES IN RESTORED AREAS AND CULTIVATED AREAS, RESPECTIVELY. SOIL MOISTURE, ELEVATION AND LOWER VEGETATION HEIGHT WERE MAJOR FACTORS INFLUENCING TAXONOMIC, FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC DIMENSIONS OF BIRD COMMUNITIES, ALTHOUGH THEIR EFFECTS VARIED ACROSS THESE DIMENSIONS. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: THE SENSITIVITY OF FOREST SPECIES TO MINOR HABITAT DISTURBANCE EMPHASIZES THE VALUE OF CONSERVING PRIMARY VEGETATION. LONG-TERM CONSERVATION OF BIRD COMMUNITIES IN AFROMONTANE ECOSYSTEMS REQUIRES HALTING WIDE-SCALE DESTRUCTION OF PRIMARY FOREST, PROMOTING VEGETATION HETEROGENEITY IN THE ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION OF DEGRADED HABITATS AND ADOPTING WILDLIFE-FRIENDLY AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MONITORING AND CONSERVATION IN THESE LANDSCAPES CAN BE REFINED USING TAXONOMIC, FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY METRICS TO PROVIDE COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT AND LIKELY FUTURE IMPACTS OF LAND USE CHANGE. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL APPALACHIAN ECOREGION, EXTENSIVE SURFACE COAL MINES GENERATE ALKALINE MINE DRAINAGE THAT RAISES THE PH, SALINITY, AND TRACE ELEMENT CONCENTRATIONS IN DOWNSTREAM WATERS. PREVIOUS REGIONAL ASSESSMENTS HAVE FOUND SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN STREAM MACROINVERTEBRATE AND FISH COMMUNITIES AFTER DRAINING THESE MINED AREAS. HERE, WE EXPAND THESE ASSESSMENTS WITH A MORE COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF ORGANISMS (BACTERIA, ALGAE, MACROINVERTEBRATES, ALL EUKARYOTES, AND FISH) USING HIGH-THROUGHPUT AMPLICON SEQUENCING OF ENVIRONMENTAL DNA (EDNA). WE COLLECTED WATER SAMPLES FROM 93 STREAMS IN CENTRAL APPALACHIA (WEST VIRGINIA, UNITED STATES) SPANNING A GRADIENT OF MOUNTAINTOP COAL MINING INTENSITY AND LEGACY TO ASSESS HOW THIS LAND USE ALTERS DOWNSTREAM WATER CHEMISTRY AND AFFECTS AQUATIC BIODIVERSITY. FOR EACH GROUP OF ORGANISMS, WE IDENTIFIED THE SENSITIVE AND TOLERANT TAXA ALONG THE GRADIENT AND CALCULATED STREAM SPECIFIC CONDUCTIVITY THRESHOLDS IN WHICH LARGE SYNCHRONOUS DECLINES IN DIVERSITY WERE OBSERVED. STREAMS BELOW MINING OPERATIONS HAD STEEP DECLINES IN DIVERSITY (−18 TO −41%) AND SUBSTANTIAL SHIFTS IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION THAT WERE CONSISTENT ACROSS MULTIPLE TAXONOMIC GROUPS. OVERALL, LARGE SYNCHRONOUS DECLINES IN BACTERIAL, ALGAL, AND MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES OCCURRED EVEN AT LOW LEVELS OF MINING IMPACT AT STREAM SPECIFIC CONDUCTIVITY THRESHOLDS OF 150–200 ΜS/CM THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE CURRENT U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AQUATIC LIFE BENCHMARK OF 300 ΜS/CM FOR CENTRAL APPALACHIAN STREAMS.

OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE EIGHT COUNTRIES FELL SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THAT OF COSTA RICA. WHILST ISOLATED GOOD EXAMPLES WERE IDENTIFIED, THE OVERALL APPROACH LEGISLATES FOR BROAD CONCEPTS BUT FAILS TO DELIVER ON DETAILED PROVISIONS. AS RECOMMENDED BY THE CURRENT REGIONAL ACTION PLAN FOR THE CONSERVATION OF WESTERN CHIMPANZEES, ALL COUNTRIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM URGENT LEGISLATIVE REFORM TO BETTER INCORPORATE MHPS WITHIN EIA PROCEDURES.

IDENTIFYING WHICH LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS INCREASE EXTINCTION RISK IS IMPORTANT TO INFORM PROACTIVE CONSERVATION. WHILE GEOGRAPHICALLY OR NUMERICALLY RARE SPECIES ARE TYPICALLY MORE VULNERABLE, ECOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATION MAY ALSO INCREASE EXTINCTION RISK PARTICULARLY WHEN ASSOCIATED WITH RARITY. WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER REGIONALLY ENDEMIC FRESHWATER FISHES HAVE MORE SPECIALIZED DIETS AND HABITAT REQUIREMENTS THAN MORE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED, CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES. WE THEN USE THIS INFORMATION TO ASSESS EXTINCTION RISK. USING CLOSELY-RELATED WIDESPREAD AND ENDEMIC CONGENERIC PAIRINGS FROM THE KIMBERLEY REGION OF NORTH-WESTERN AUSTRALIA, WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER THERE ARE ONTOGENETIC DIET SHIFTS IN 13 SPECIES AND IF SOME OF THESE ONTOGENETIC TROPHIC UNITS (OTUS) HAVE NARROW DIETARY NICHES. USING QUALITATIVE MEASURES OF HABITAT AND PRESENCE/ABSENCE DATA, WE ALSO ASSESS HABITAT SPECIALIZATION IN 32 SPECIES. OVERALL, RANGE-RESTRICTED SPECIES HAD NARROWER ECOLOGICAL NICHES. ONTOGENETIC DIET SHIFTS EXISTED IN 12 OF 13 SPECIES AND RANGE-RESTRICTED SPECIES WERE MORE SPECIALIZED FOR SOME OR ALL OF THEIR OTUS COMPARED TO THEIR WIDESPREAD CONGENERICS. ENDEMIC SPECIES HAD A HIGHER DEGREE OF VARIANCE IN HABITAT USE COMPARED TO THEIR WIDESPREAD CONGENERICS, SHOWING THEY HAD MORE SPECIALIZED HABITAT REQUIREMENTS. AS SPECIALIZATION IS LINKED TO EXTINCTION RISK, THE NARROW NICHE BREADTH OF SMALL-RANGED ENDEMIC FISHES MAKES THEM MORE VULNERABLE TO EXTINCTION THAN MORE COSMOPOLITAN SPECIES.

RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE RECOVERY OF PLANT AND VERTEBRATE SPECIES RICHNESS IS RELATIVELY FAST, BUT THE PACE OF RECOVERY FOR OTHER GROUPS REMAINS UNCLEAR. SOIL MACROINVERTEBRATES PLAY CRITICAL ROLES ON LITTER DECOMPOSITION AND SEED DISPERSAL, THEREFORE THE PACE OF THEIR RECOVERY HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ENTIRE FOREST ECOSYSTEM. WE INVESTIGATED HOW FAST BROAD TAXONOMIC GROUPS OF SOIL MACROFAUNA RECOVER IN THE FIRST 30 YEARS OF FOREST REGENERATION USING FORESTS OLDER THAN 50 YEARS AS REFERENCE. WE SURVEYED THE NUMBER, DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF 19 BROAD TAXONOMIC GROUPS OF SOIL MACROFAUNA IN 85 SITES LOCATED IN BRAZILIAN AMAZON, COVERING FORESTS OF DIFFERENT AGES AND CLEARING FREQUENCIES. FOREST AGE AND CLEARING FREQUENCY WERE OBTAINED ACCURATELY FROM LANDSAT IMAGES IN FORESTS UP TO 30 YEARS OLD. WE USED REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE (A) THE EFFECTS FOREST AGE AND CLEARING FREQUENCY ON MACROFAUNA GROUPS IN SECONDARY FORESTS UP TO 30 YEARS OLD; AND (B) THE CHANGES IN MACROFAUNA GROUPS BETWEEN YOUNG FORESTS (UP TO 10 YEARS OLD), MEDIAN AGE FORESTS (BETWEEN 10 AND 30 YEARS OLD) AND FORESTS OLDER THAN 50 YEARS. WE FOUND THAT THE NUMBER AND DIVERSITY OF MACROFAUNA GROUPS RECOVER RAPIDLY IN THE FIRST 10 YEARS OF FOREST REGROWTH, BUT SHOW SLOWER CHANGE AMONG OLDER FORESTS. THIS RAPID RECOVERY WAS ALSO OBSERVED IN THE ABUNDANCE OF SEVERAL TAXONOMIC GROUPS AND FOR PREDATORS AND DETRITIVORES AS FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. FOREST CLEARING FREQUENCY HAD NO EFFECT ON THE NUMBER OR THE DIVERSITY OF MACROFAUNA GROUPS, BUT THE ABUNDANCE OF ANTS INCREASED AS FOREST WAS CLEARED MORE OFTEN. OUR RESULTS FOR SOIL MACROFAUNA ALIGN WITH THOSE IN PLANT AND VERTEBRATE STUDIES SHOWING THAT SECONDARY FORESTS QUICKLY RECOVER A LARGE PART OF THEIR BIODIVERSITY AND ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS.

COMPOUNDING THESE THREATS ARE INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES OVER TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, EXERTING A GENERAL DISINCLINATION TOWARD REGIONAL COLLABORATIONS TO SOLVE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. SINCE SEA TURTLES ARE MIGRATORY ANIMALS THAT MOVE THROUGH AQUATIC AND TERRESTRIAL HABITATS, FEEDING IN WATERS, AND NESTING ON BEACHES UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF MULTIPLE COUNTRIES, THE SPECIES IS AN IDEAL AMBASSADOR TO RAISE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS. TRANSNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS TO COORDINATE CONSERVATION EFFORTS ACROSS BORDERS PROVIDE A POSITIVE AGENDA OF COOPERATION TO BUILD TRUST, CREATING A POLITICALLY NEUTRAL PLATFORM TO FACILITATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIPLOMACY TO RESET AND IMPROVE FOREIGN RELATIONS, UNDERSCORING THE VALUE OF SEA TURTLES AS A FLAGSHIP SPECIES TO REDUCE INTERNATIONAL TENSIONS AND BRING NATIONS TOGETHER. FOR THIS REASON, THE U.S.-CHINA ECOPARTNERSHIP BETWEEN SEA TURTLES 911 AND HAINAN NORMAL UNIVERSITY WAS FORMED TO EMPOWER LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT THE OCEAN THROUGH SEA TURTLE RESCUE, PUBLIC EDUCATION, AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROJECTS.

DEBRIS POLLUTION SURVEY AT A MAJOR TURTLE NESTING BEACH IN THE PARACEL ISLANDS DEMONSTRATED THAT POLLUTION IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING NEWBORN TURTLE HATCHLINGS AND THAT REGIONAL COOPERATION IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA SHOULD PROMOTE THE REDUCTION AND CLEANUP OF MARINE DEBRIS.

A SEA TURTLE RESCUE CENTER WAS JOINTLY ESTABLISHED IN WHICH MORE THAN 100 SEA TURTLES WERE SUCCESSFULLY RESCUED AND RELEASED BY THE INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL COMMUNITY, INCLUDING STUDENTS WHO WON NATIONAL AWARDS FOR THEIR VOLUNTEER SERVICE.

LONG-DISTANCE MIGRANTS SEEM ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO RAPID ANTHROPOGENIC CHANGE, YET, THE RATE OF DECLINE ACROSS POPULATIONS AND SPECIES VARIES GREATLY WITHIN FLYWAYS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT DIFFERENCES IN MIGRATION STRATEGY, AND NOTABLY STOPOVER-SITE USE, MAY BE AT THE BASIS OF THESE VARIATIONS IN RESILIENCE TO GLOBAL CHANGE. BY IDENTIFYING AND COMPARING THE MIGRATION STRATEGIES OF TWO VERY CLOSELY RELATED SHOREBIRD SPECIES, THE CURLEW SANDPIPER CALIDRIS FERRUGINEA AND THE RED-NECKED STINT CALIDRIS RUFICOLLIS, MIGRATING FROM THE SAME NON-BREEDING SITE IN AUSTRALIA TO SIMILAR BREEDING SITES IN THE HIGH RUSSIAN ARCTIC, WE AIMED TO EXPLAIN WHY THESE TWO SPECIES EXPRESS DIFFERENTIAL RESILIENCE TO RAPID CHANGES WITHIN THEIR FLYWAY RESULTING IN DIFFERENT POPULATION TRAJECTORIES IN RECENT TIMES. BASED ON 13 CURLEW SANDPIPER AND 16 RED-NECKED STINT TRACKS FROM LIGHT-LEVEL GEOLOCATOR TAGS, WE FOUND THAT INDIVIDUAL CURLEW SANDPIPERS MAKE USE OF FEWER STOPOVER AREAS ALONG THE FLYWAY COMPARED TO RED-NECKED STINTS. FURTHERMORE, AND NOTABLY DURING NORTHWARD MIGRATION, CURLEW SANDPIPERS HAVE A HIGHER DEPENDENCY ON FEWER SITES, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS VISITING KEY STOPOVER SITES AND THE RELATIVE TIME SPENT AT THOSE SITES. WHILE CURLEW SANDPIPERS RELY MAINLY ON THE YELLOW SEA REGION, WHICH HAS RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A SHARP DECLINE IN SUITABLE HABITAT, RED-NECKED STINTS MAKE USE OF ADDITIONAL SITES AND SPREAD THEIR RELATIVE TIME EN-ROUTE ACROSS SITES MORE EVENLY. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT DIFFERENTIAL MIGRATION STRATEGIES MAY EXPLAIN WHY CURLEW SANDPIPERS WITHIN THE EAST ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN FLYWAY ARE DECLINING RAPIDLY (9.5%–5.5% PER YEAR) WHILE RED-NECKED STINTS REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE (−3.1%–0%). WE CONSIDER THAT MORE GENERALLY, THE NUMBER OF SITES PER INDIVIDUAL AND AMONG A POPULATION, THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION ACROSS THE FLYWAY, AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TIME SPENT OVER SITES MAY PROVE TO BE KEY VARIABLES EXPLAINING POPULATIONS AND SPECIES' DIFFERENTIAL RESILIENCE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

HERE, WE INVESTIGATE AVIAN EXTINCTIONS RESULTING FROM THE TUCURUÍ HYDROELECTRIC RESERVOIR (THR), THE OLDEST AMAZONIAN MEGA DAM, WHICH IMPOUNDED THE TOCANTINS RIVER IN 1984. OUR AVIAN INVENTORY—BASED ON SEVERAL SAMPLING METHODS (MIST-NETTING, POINT-COUNTS, BOAT CENSUS AND QUALITATIVE SURVEYS) DURING 280 DAYS OF FIELDWORK FROM 2005 TO 2007—WAS COMBINED WITH AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH OF MUSEUM VOUCHERS AND DIGITAL ONLINE DATABASES OF CITIZEN SCIENCE FROM THE LOWER TOCANTINS RIVER TO IDENTIFY LONG-TERM TRENDS IN SPECIES PERSISTENCE AND EXTINCTION IN THE THR INFLUENCE AREA. THE REGIONAL AVIFAUNA WAS COMPRISED OF 479 SPECIES, 404 OF WHICH WERE RECORDED DURING OUR FIELDWORK. BASED ON RECENT AND HISTORICAL RECORDS SPANNING 172 YEARS, WE FOUND EVIDENCE FOR LIKELY EXTINCTIONS AT THR INFLUENCE AREA FOR 53 (11.06%) SPECIES THAT HAVE REMAINED ENTIRELY UNREPORTED SINCE 1984.

ONE MAJOR DRIVER IS THE UNSUSTAINABLE TRADE OF WILDLIFE. TRADE IN INTERNATIONALLY REGULATED SPECIES GAINS THE MOST RESEARCH ATTENTION, BUT THIS ONLY ACCOUNTS FOR A MINORITY OF TRADED SPECIES AND WE RISK FAILING TO APPRECIATE THE SCALE AND IMPACTS OF UNREGULATED LEGAL TRADE. DESPITE BEING LEGAL, TRADE PUTS PRESSURE ON WILD SPECIES VIA: DIRECT COLLECTION, INTRODUCED PATHOGENS, AND INVASIVE SPECIES. SMALLER SPECIES-RICH VERTEBRATES, SUCH REPTILES, FISH, AND AMPHIBIANS, MAY BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO TRADING BECAUSE OF GAPS IN REGULATIONS, SMALL DISTRIBUTIONS, AND DEMAND OF NOVEL SPECIES. HERE WE COMBINE DATA FROM FIVE SOURCES: ONLINE WEB SEARCHES IN SIX LANGUAGES, CITES TRADE DATABASE, LEMIS TRADE INVENTORY, IUCN ASSESSMENTS, AND A RECENT LITERATURE REVIEW, TO CHARACTERISE THE GLOBAL TRADE IN AMPHIBIANS, AND ALSO MAP USE BY PURPOSE INCLUDING MEAT, PETS, MEDICINAL AND FOR RESEARCH.

APPL.,1,"BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ARE A LEADING DRIVER OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND POPULATION DECLINES WORLDWIDE. WHILE MUCH RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF LONG-DISTANCE (E.G., CROSS-CONTINENTAL) INVASION, THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF SPECIES THAT INVADE CLOSE TO OR WITHIN THEIR NATIVE RANGES ARE RELATIVELY UNDERSTUDIED. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF THE NEAR-RANGE INTRODUCTION OF A NON-NATIVE PLANT, NEW MEXICO LOCUST (ROBINIA NEOMEXICANA), ON RIPARIAN PLANT AND BIRD COMMUNITIES IN NORTHWESTERN COLORADO, USA. BY SURVEYING PLANT AND BIRD COMMUNITIES AND EXAMINING NEST SUCCESS AND PRODUCTIVITY IN RIPARIAN FOREST WITH AND WITHOUT LOCUST, WE EVALUATED THE FOLLOWING ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO INVASION: (1) TREE AND SHRUB RICHNESS AND DENSITY; (2) BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS, OCCUPANCY, AND ABUNDANCE; AND (3) AVIAN REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION OF THE PLANT COMMUNITY WITH INCREASING INTENSITY OF LOCUST INVASION, YET WE FOUND LITTLE EVIDENCE FOR NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON AVIAN HABITAT USE OR REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. INSTEAD, LOCUST INVASION SHOWED A POSITIVE EFFECT ON NEST PRODUCTIVITY, WITH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BROOD SIZES AND NUMBERS OF YOUNG FLEDGED FOR NESTS IN INVADED HABITATS COMPARED TO THOSE WHERE LOCUST WAS ABSENT. BECAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY LEADING TO SHIFTS IN SPECIES DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS, WE SUGGEST THAT UNDERSTANDING THE ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF PLANT INVASIONS THAT OCCUR WITHIN OR NEAR HISTORIC RANGES WILL ADVANCE THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF INVASIVE SPECIES BIOLOGY IN A CHANGING WORLD. OUR FINDINGS OF MOSTLY NEUTRAL TO POSITIVE EFFECTS OF LOCUST SUGGEST THAT NEAR-RANGE PLANT INVASIONS MAY NOT ALWAYS NEGATIVELY IMPACT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. LAY SUMMARY NEAR-RANGE INTRODUCTIONS OCCUR WHEN SPECIES ARE BROUGHT TO AREAS CLOSE TO THEIR NATIVE RANGES. THOUGH MUCH LESS STUDIED THAN TRADITIONAL LONG-DISTANCE INVASIONS, THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM NATIVE PLANT AND ANIMAL COMMUNITIES. NEW MEXICO LOCUST, A FAST-GROWING WOODY PLANT, WAS INTRODUCED TO A VALLEY IN COLORADO, USA, NEAR ITS NORTHERN RANGE BOUNDARY. WE COLLECTED DATA ON PLANTS AND BIRDS IN AREAS WITH AND WITHOUT LOCUST AND FOUND THAT LOCUST DECREASED THE DIVERSITY OF PLANT SPECIES BUT HAD NEUTRAL TO POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THE BIRD COMMUNITY. NESTS LOCATED IN AREAS WITH LOCUST PRODUCED MORE NESTLINGS THAN THOSE IN UNINVADED SITES, SUGGESTING LOCUST MAY PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR SOME SONGBIRDS, POTENTIALLY IN THE FORM OF ENHANCED NEST PROTECTION AND/OR FOOD AVAILABILITY.

IN THIS RESEARCH, THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF TWO POSSIBLE STRESS SOURCES FOR BEES, PESTICIDES AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS (MULTI-STRESS CONDITIONS), WERE ANALYZED IN THE FIELD. THREE EXPERIMENTAL SITES WERE CHOSEN: A CONTROL ONE FAR FROM DIRECT ANTHROPOGENIC STRESS SOURCES, A PESTICIDE-STRESS SITE AND MULTI-STRESS ONE, ADDING TO THE SAME EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES THE PRESENCE OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD, COMING FROM A HIGH-VOLTAGE ELECTRIC LINE. EXPERIMENTAL APIARIES WERE MONITORED WEEKLY FOR ONE YEAR (FROM APRIL 2017 TO APRIL 2018) BY MEANS OF COLONY SURVIVAL, QUEEN ACTIVITY, STORAGE AND BROOD AMOUNT, PARASITES AND PATHOGENS, AND SEVERAL BIOMARKERS IN YOUNG WORKERS AND PUPAE. BOTH EXPOSURE AND EFFECT BIOMARKERS WERE ANALYSED: AMONG THE FIRST, ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE), CATALASE (CAT), GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE (GST) AND ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE (ALP) AND REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS); AND AMONG THE LAST, DNA FRAGMENTATION (DNAFRAGM) AND LIPID PEROXIDATION (LPO). RESULTS SHOWED THAT BEE HEALTH CONDITIONS WERE THE WORST IN THE MULTI-STRESS SITE WITH ONLY ONE COLONY ALIVE OUT OF THE FOUR ONES PRESENT AT THE BEGINNING. IN THIS SITE, A COMPLEX PICTURE OF ADVERSE EFFECTS WAS OBSERVED, SUCH AS DISEASE APPEARANCE (AMERICAN FOULBROOD), HIGHER MORTALITY IN THE UNDERBASKETS (COMMON TO PESTICIDE-STRESS SITE), BEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS (QUEEN CHANGES, EXCESS OF HONEY STORAGE) AND BIOCHEMICAL ANOMALIES (HIGHER ALP ACTIVITY AT THE END OF THE SEASON).

TYPICAL CONSERVATION PLANS CAN BE CREATED TO FOCUS ON SINGLE OR MULTIPLE SPECIES, AND ALTHOUGH THEY MAY PROTECT A SPECIES OR GROUPS OF SPECIES, THEY MAY NOT ACCOUNT FOR BIODIVERSITY OR ITS PROTECTION ACROSS THE GIVEN AREA. WE APPLIED AN APPROACH THAT CLUSTERED DEDUCTIVE HABITAT MODELS FOR TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES INTO METRICS THAT SERVE AS SURROGATES FOR BIODIVERSITY AND RELATE TO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THIS PROCESS, WE COLLAB-ORATED WITH THE PARTNERING AGENCIES WHO ARE CREATING A MULTI‐SPECIES HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND COMPARED IT TO THE ENTIRE MOJAVE DESERT ECOREGION. WE FOCUSED ON TOTAL TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATE SPECIES RICHNESS AND TAXON GROUPINGS REPRESENTING AMPHIBIANS, BIRDS, MAM-MALS, AND REPTILES, AND TWO SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES USING THE NORMALIZED INDEX OF BIODIVERSITY (NIB). THE CONSERVATION PLANNING AREA HAD A LOWER NIB AND WAS LESS SPECIES RICH THAN THE MOJAVE DESERT ECOREGION, BUT THE MOJAVE RIVER RIPARIAN CORRIDOR HAD A HIGHER NIB AND WAS MORE SPECIES‐RICH, AND WHILE TAXON ANALYSIS VARIED ACROSS THE GEOGRAPHIES, THIS PATTERN GENERALLY HELD. ADDITIONALLY, WE ANALYZED DESERT TORTOISE (GOPHERUS AGASSIZII) AND DESERT KIT FOX (VULPES MACROTIS ARSIPUS) AS UMBRELLA SPECIES AND DETERMINED THAT BOTH SPECIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED NIB AND LARGE NUMBERS OF SPECIES FOR THE CONSERVATION AREA.

APPL.,1,"BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ARE IMPORTANT CAUSES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS, PARTICULARLY IN REMOTE ISLANDS. BROWN TROUT (SALMO TRUTTA) HAVE BEEN WIDELY INTRODUCED THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, IMPACTING ENDANGERED NATIVE FAUNA, PARTICULARLY GALAXIID FISHES, THROUGH PREDATION AND COMPETITION. HOWEVER, DUE TO THEIR IMPORTANCE FOR SPORT FISHING AND AQUACULTURE FARMING, ATTEMPTS TO CURTAIL THE IMPACTS OF INVASIVE SALMONIDS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN MET WITH LIMITED SUPPORT AND THE BEST PROSPECTS FOR PROTECTING NATIVE GALAXIIDS IS TO PREDICT WHERE AND HOW SALMONIDS MIGHT DISPERSE. WE ANALYSED 266 INVASIVE BROWN TROUT FROM 14 RIVERS AND PONDS ACROSS THE FALKLAND ISLANDS AS WELL AS 32 TROUT FROM THREE POTENTIAL SOURCE POPULATIONS, USING A PANEL OF 592 SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS (SNPS) AND ACOUSTIC TAGGING, TO ASCERTAIN THEIR ORIGINS AND CURRENT PATTERNS OF DISPERSAL. WE IDENTIFIED FOUR GENETICALLY DISTINCT CLUSTERS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND LOW ADMIXTURE, LIKELY REFLECTING THE DIFFERENT ORIGINS OF THE INVASIVE BROWN TROUT POPULATIONS. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT MANY TROUT POPULATIONS IN THE FALKLANDS MAY HAVE ORIGINATED FROM ONE OF THE DONOR POPULATIONS ANALYSED (RIVER WEY). THE HIGHEST GENETIC DIVERSITY WAS OBSERVED IN THE RIVERS WITH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF INTRODUCTIONS AND DIVERSE ORIGINS, WHILE THE LOWEST DIVERSITY CORRESPONDED TO A LOCATION WITHOUT DOCUMENTED INTRODUCTIONS, LIKELY COLONIZED BY NATURAL DISPERSAL. HIGH LEVELS OF GENE FLOW INDICATED WIDESPREAD MIGRATION OF BROWN TROUT ACROSS THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, LIKELY AIDED BY ANADROMOUS DISPERSAL. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY DATA FROM ACOUSTICALLY TAGGED FISH, THREE OF WHICH WERE DETECTED FREQUENTLY MOVING BETWEEN TWO RIVERS ~26 KM APART. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, WITHOUT CONTAINMENT MEASURES, BROWN TROUT MAY INVADE THE LAST REMAINING REFUGES FOR THE NATIVE ENDANGERED APLOCHITON SPP. WE PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE ORIGIN AND DISPERSAL OF INVASIVE BROWN TROUT IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS THAT CAN PAVE THE WAY FOR A TARGETED APPROACH TO LIMIT THEIR IMPACT ON NATIVE FISH FAUNA. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

INSECT CONSERV.,0,"ABSTRACT: THE CURRENT BIODIVERSITY CRISIS CALLS FOR RAPID AND WIDE-RANGING SURVEYS TO ASSESS LIVING ORGANISMS. HOWEVER, SOME TAXA ARE MORE ELUSIVE THAN OTHERS, MAKING MONITORING CHALLENGING. THIS IS THE CASE FOR SOIL INVERTEBRATES, BUT NEW MOLECULAR TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS EDNA METABARCODING COULD HELP TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM. IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY OF USING AN EDNA APPROACH TO SURVEY DUNG BEETLES, ADAPTING EXISTING MONITORING METHODS FOR SURVEYING DUNG FAUNA TO ENABLE EDNA COLLECTION IN A NON-DESTRUCTIVE WAY. THE MAIN DESIGN IDEA IS TO CAPTURE SPECIES SECRETIONS AND EXCRETIONS FROM A SERUM-SOAKED NONWOVEN COMPRESS IN A BAITED NON-DESTRUCTIVE TRAP. WHILE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE DEVICE TO DUNG BEETLES AND THE SAMPLING PROTOCOL WOULD BENEFIT FROM FURTHER DEVELOPMENT, EDNA ALLOWED THE IDENTIFICATION OF MORE THAN 68% OF TRAPPED SPECIES AND AN IDENTIFICATION OF RELATIVE ABUNDANCE MATCH RATE OF 79%. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EDNA-BASED DETECTION TOOLS FOR THE MONITORING OF DUNG BEETLES COMPARED TO STANDARD SURVEYING AND IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES. MOREOVER, THE ADAPTED COLLECTING DEVICE DEVELOPED FOR THE STUDY COULD BE USED FOR SIMILAR SURVEYS OF OTHER TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES OR EVEN RE-ADAPTED. ULTIMATELY, WE HOPE THIS STUDY ENCOURAGES MORE NON-INVASIVE STUDIES OF INSECTS BY ENABLING OTHERS TO UTILIZE THESE EMERGING, NON-DESTRUCTIVE MOLECULAR TECHNIQUES AND THEREFORE FOSTER WIDE INSECT MONITORINGS AND CONSERVATION PROGRAMS. IMPLICATIONS FOR INSECT CONSERVATION: STANDARDIZATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF SAMPLING PROTOCOLS FOR INVENTORYING AND MONITORING IS KEY TO UNLOCK INVERTEBRATES’ STUDIES AND CONSERVATION EVALUATIONS. HERE WE SHOW HOW MOLECULAR TOOLS, SUCH AS EDNA, ARE A PROMISING WAY TO GATHER RAPIDLY ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION WITHOUT KILLING TARGETED POPULATIONS BY ADAPTING TRADITIONAL INVENTORY TOOLS.

ALTHOUGH THE NATURA 2000 NETWORK DIRECTLY ADDRESSES BIRDS, THESE HAVE SHOWN WORRYING DECLINING TRENDS. IT IS THEREFORE CRUCIAL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION OF NATURA 2000 CONSERVATION MEASURES. IN THIS PAPER, WE USE A REPLICABLE METHOD TO MODEL BIRD TRENDS IN THE PERIOD 2000–2015 AND THE EFFECTS OF NATURA 2000 PROTECTION, ACROSS LAND COVER CLASSES, ON REGIONAL ABUNDANCES AND LOCAL SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY. WE MODEL BIRD TRENDS IN VENETO, A NORTH-EASTERN ITALIAN REGION WITH AREAS AMONG THE RICHEST IN BIRD SPECIES IN ITALY. BIRD DATA WERE DERIVED FROM THE NATIONAL BREEDING BIRD MONITORING SCHEME. BREEDING BIRDS SHOWED DECLINING TRENDS AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL, CONFIRMING NATIONAL AND CONTINENTAL TRENDS, PARTICULARLY ON AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL AREAS. THE LAND COVER CLASS, RATHER THAN NATURA 2000, MOSTLY INFLUENCED POPULATION TRENDS; HOWEVER, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO OBSERVE SLIGHTLY HIGHER ESTIMATES OF SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY IN NATURA 2000 SITES. DESPITE THE ABSOLUTE HIGHER ESTIMATES OF RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY OVER THE INVESTIGATED PERIOD, FARMLAND AND WOODLAND BIRD SPECIES HAD STEEPER DECLINING TRENDS INSIDE NATURA 2000 THAN OUTSIDE, MATCHING THE VALUES OF THE AREAS OUTSIDE THE NETWORK AT THE END OF THE SURVEY PERIOD. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE NATURA 2000 NETWORK CAPACITY TO BUFFER BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND ACT AS A SPECIES-POOL FOR NON-PROTECTED AREAS IS DECREASING OVER TIME, MAINLY WITH REGARDS TO FARMLAND AND WOODLAND BIRDS.

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROTECTED AREAS IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO MITIGATE FURTHER FOREST BIODIVERSITY LOSS. HOWEVER, THE ABILITY OF DEGRADED RAINFOREST TO SUPPORT AVIAN BIODIVERSITY IS STILL REMAIN LITTLE KNOWN.

REFORESTATION MAY COMPENSATE OR REDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON SPECIES, BUT THIS HYPOTHESIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED YET. HERE WE QUANTIFY THE ADDITIVE AND SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS OF FOREST CHANGE – IN PARTICULAR, REFORESTATION – AND CLIMATE CHANGES ON TEN ENDEMIC AND FOREST-DEPENDENT ANURANS OF THE ATLANTIC FOREST BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT. WE ESTIMATED CLIMATIC AND HABITAT SUITABILITY FOR ALL SPECIES UNDER HISTORICAL AND FUTURE (2050) CONDITIONS, USING NICHE MODELING AND FOREST COVER MAPS FROM A COMPREHENSIVE LAND-USE MODEL. WE CONTRASTED A PESSIMISTIC LAND-USE SCENARIO, WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN FOREST COVER, WITH AN OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO, WITH FOREST GAIN THROUGH RESTORATION OF “LEGAL RESERVE” AREAS. OUR MODELS SHOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE WILL HAVE SPECIES-SPECIFIC EFFECTS ON ANURANS, INCREASING CLIMATIC SUITABILITY FOR SEVEN SPECIES, BUT DECREASING FOR THREE. FOR THESE THREE SPECIES, WE PREDICT THAT FOREST GAIN CAN COMPENSATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, INCREASING OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL SUITABILITY. THESE RESULTS REINFORCE THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING REFORESTATION AND FOREST PROTECTION AS A CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION STRATEGY FOR BIODIVERSITY. © 2021 ELSEVIER LTD",109187,NA,BICOB,"RAMALHO, Q.; UNIVERSIDADE DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO, LABORATÓRIO DE ECOLOGIA DE PAISAGENS, RUA SÃO FRANCISCO XAVIER 524, BRAZIL; EMAIL: QUEZIARAMALHO@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109187,"465610/2014-5 COORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIORCOORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIOR, CAPES CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICO, CNPQ, 304309/2018-4 FUNDAÇÃO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIROFUNDAÇÃO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO, FAPERJ FINANCIADORA DE ESTUDOS E PROJETOSFINANCIADORA DE ESTUDOS E PROJETOS, FINEP, 01.13.0353-00 FUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE GOIÁSFUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE GOIÁS, FAPEG, 201810267000023",63207,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,6,NA,NA,ELSEVIER LTD,NA,SCOPUS,REFORESTATION CAN COMPENSATE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON AMPHIBIANS,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107137455&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2021.109187&partnerID=40&md5=ea794b1629209a62858bd6950606c8a2,260,2021,"RAMALHO MASTER'S STUDENTSHIP WAS FUNDED BY COORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES, FINANCE CODE 001) AND FUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ).

THE OVERALL SPECIES RICHNESS OF FROGS WAS, ON AVERAGE, 57% LESS IN URBAN THAN NON-URBAN AREAS ACROSS SIX ECOREGIONS. FURTHER, WE FOUND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FROG DIVERSITY IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS COMPARED WITH NON-URBAN ENVIRONMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WITH AN AVERAGE REDUCTION OF 59% SPECIES RICHNESS, 86% SHANNON DIVERSITY, AND 72% PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY. WE ALSO FOUND EVIDENCE FOR A STEADY DECREASE IN FROG DIVERSITY ALONG AN URBANIZATION GRADIENT, WITH NO OBVIOUS THRESHOLDS.

CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES – THE NON-MATERIAL BENEFITS PEOPLE DERIVE FROM THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH NATURE – ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. HOWEVER, DETERMINING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF BIODIVERSITY TO THESE BENEFITS HAS PROVEN MORE CHALLENGING THAN FOR OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. HERE, WE DETERMINE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DIVERSITY (MEASURED AS CULTIVAR RICHNESS) AND ABUNDANCE (NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS) TO THE AESTHETIC VALUE OF FLOWERING PLANT COMMUNITIES, USING SUNFLOWERS AS A MODEL ORGANISM. WE CREATED GRASSLAND VEGETATION PLOTS CONSISTING OF DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF SUNFLOWER CULTIVARS AND INDIVIDUALS, PRESENTED THESE TREATMENTS TO PEOPLE, AND MEASURED THEIR AESTHETIC PREFERENCES (BOTH SELF-REPORTED AND OBJECTIVE BEHAVIOURAL MEASURES) TOWARDS THEM. WE FOUND THAT PEOPLE'S AESTHETIC PREFERENCES WERE UNRELATED TO DIFFERENCES IN THE CULTIVAR RICHNESS OF THE PLOTS BUT INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY WITH THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THESE PREFERENCE PATTERNS DID NOT DIFFER WITH A PARTICIPANTS’ NATURE ORIENTATION, ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE, OR GENDER, SUGGESTING THE GENERALITY OF THE RESULTS. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE ABUNDANCE OF WILDLIFE CAN PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN SHAPING THE CULTURAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY ECOSYSTEMS. RESEARCHERS AND POLICY-MAKERS SHOULD THEREFORE PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE ROLE OF ABUNDANCE IN MAINTAINING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. © 2021",127194,NA,NA,"SOGA, M.; GRADUATE SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURAL AND LIFE SCIENCES, 1-1-1 YAYOI, JAPAN; EMAIL: ASOGA@G.ECC.U-TOKYO.AC.JP",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127194,NA,16188667,URBAN FORESTRY AND URBAN GREENING,ENGLISH,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,ELSEVIER GMBH,NA,SCOPUS,SPECIES ABUNDANCE AS A DETERMINANT OF AESTHETIC VALUES OF FLOWERING PLANT COMMUNITIES,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106458462&doi=10.1016%2fj.ufug.2021.127194&partnerID=40&md5=87bb1a6ac200ae2ffd29ba3ab4bcc1a8,63,2021,NA NA NA,URBAN FOR URBAN GREENING,none,THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO;TOKYO GAKUGEI UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF EXETER,NOTREPORTED;GRADUATE SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURAL AND LIFE SCIENCES;NOTREPORTED,NA,"SOGA M, 2021, URBAN FOR URBAN GREENING","SOGA M, 2021, URBAN FOR URBAN GREENING"

ALTHOUGH URBANIZATION AFFECTS BOTH HOST AND VECTOR COMMUNITIES, THE EFFECTS ON VECTOR-BORNE PATHOGENS ARE STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HERE, WE MONITORED VARIATION IN PREVALENCE AND RICHNESS OF THREE COMMON BLOOD PARASITES IN BIRDS (PLASMODIUM, HAEMOPROTEUS AND LEUCOCYTOZOON) FROM LOCALITIES WITH DIFFERENT LAND USES (URBAN, RURAL AND NATURAL) DURING TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS (2013 AND 2014). OVERALL, 1400 JUVENILE HOUSE SPARROWS (PASSER DOMESTICUS) FROM 15 LOCALITIES IN SOUTHERN SPAIN WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY. HAEMOPROTEUS AND LEUCOCYTOZOON PREVALENCE WAS HIGHER IN 2013 THAN IN 2014, PARTICULARLY IN URBAN AND NATURAL HABITATS FOR THE CASE OF LEUCOCYTOZOON. PREVALENCE WAS CORRELATED BETWEEN YEARS FOR HAEMOPROTEUS AND LEUCOCYTOZOON, INDEPENDENTLY OF THE HABITAT. ADDITIONALLY, RURAL HABITATS HARBOURED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER HAEMOPROTEUS LINEAGE RICHNESS COMPARED TO URBAN AND NATURAL HABITATS DURING 2014. LEUCOCYTOZOON LINEAGE RICHNESS WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED BETWEEN YEARS IN RURAL HABITATS BUT POSITIVELY CORRELATED IN URBAN AND NATURAL HABITATS IN COMPARISON. PARASITE LINEAGES FOUND IN BIRDS WERE HOMOGENEOUSLY DISTRIBUTED ALONG HABITATS AND YEARS AND THE COMMON LINEAGES PREVALENCE WERE NOT INFLUENCED BY THEM. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF INFECTION DEPENDING ON THE PARASITE GENERA PROBABLY RELATED TO THE COMPOSITION AND DENSITY OF VECTOR COMMUNITIES.

WE EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL COMPETITION BETWEEN NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE ISLAND BIRD SPECIES, IDENTIFYING SPECIES AND ISLAND CHARACTERISTICS THAT ENHANCE IT AND MAY PROMOTE FUTURE EXTINCTIONS. LOCATION: SEVENTY-THREE (&GT;100 KM2) OCEANIC ISLANDS WORLDWIDE. METHODS: WE COMPILED A SPECIES LIST FOR EACH ISLAND AND USED SINGLE-TRAIT META-ANALYSES TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE SPECIES. THEN, WE USED SINGLE-TRAIT BETA REGRESSION MODELS TO IDENTIFY SPECIES TRAITS LINKED TO POTENTIAL COMPETITION. FINALLY, WE USED A TRAIT-BASED APPROACH TO CALCULATE THE POTENTIAL COMPETITION BETWEEN NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE SPECIES ON EACH ISLAND AND IDENTIFY ISLAND CHARACTERISTICS LINKED TO POTENTIAL COMPETITION. RESULTS: NATIVE BIRD SPECIES TENDED TO BE SMALLER FOREST DWELLERS, THAT WERE EITHER CARNIVORE, FRUGIVORE OR INSECTIVORE, AND THAT FORAGED IN FLIGHT, IN THE CANOPY OR AT MID-HEIGHT. IN CONTRAST, NON-NATIVE BIRDS TENDED TO BE OPEN HABITAT GRANIVORES, THAT WERE EITHER GROUND OR UNSPECIALIZED FORAGERS. POTENTIAL COMPETITION TENDED TO BE HIGHER FOR NATIVE SPECIES WITH TYPICAL NON-NATIVE TRAITS AND FOREST-DWELLING UNSPECIALIZED NON-NATIVE SPECIES. POTENTIAL COMPETITION BETWEEN NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE BIRDS WAS CONSISTENTLY HIGHER IN ISLANDS THAT WERE LARGER, HAD MORE NON-NATIVE BIRDS OR WERE DRIER. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: NICHE DIFFERENTIATION OF NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE SPECIES MAY EXPLAIN THE SCARCITY OF REPORTED COMPETITION-DRIVEN EXTINCTIONS SINCE NON-NATIVES CLEARLY TEND TO FAVOUR AND ARE BETTER ADAPTED TO ANTHROPOGENIC ENVIRONMENTS. HOWEVER, THE FEW NON-NATIVE BIRDS THAT OCCUR IN NATIVE ECOSYSTEMS MAY BE PROBLEMATIC. THE LOSS OF NATIVE ECOSYSTEMS COUPLED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF SPECIES THAT MIGHT OUTCOMPETE NATIVE SPECIES MAY ENHANCE THE RELEVANCE OF COMPETITION IN FUTURE ISLAND EXTINCTIONS. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

THE INTEGRATION OF MARINE RESERVES INTO CONNECTED NETWORKS REPRESENTING ALL HABITATS HAS BEEN ENCOURAGED BY INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, YET THE BENEFITS OF THIS DESIGN HAS NOT BEEN TESTED EMPIRICALLY. AUSTRALIA HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST SYSTEMS OF MARINE RESERVES, PROVIDING A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS HOW CONNECTIVITY INFLUENCES CONSERVATION SUCCESS. AN AUSTRALIA-WIDE DATASET WAS COLLECTED USING BAITED REMOTE UNDERWATER VIDEO SYSTEMS DEPLOYED ACROSS A DEPTH RANGE FROM 0 TO 100 M TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MARINE RESERVES FOR PROTECTING TELEOSTS SUBJECT TO COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHING. A META-ANALYTICAL COMPARISON OF 73 FISHED SPECIES WITHIN 91 MARINE RESERVES FOUND THAT, ON AVERAGE, MARINE RESERVES HAD 28% GREATER ABUNDANCE AND 53% GREATER BIOMASS OF FISHED SPECIES COMPARED TO ADJACENT AREAS OPEN TO FISHING. HOWEVER, BENEFITS OF PROTECTION WERE NOT OBSERVED ACROSS ALL RESERVES (HETEROGENEITY), SO FULL SUBSETS GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODELLING WAS USED TO CONSIDER FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE MARINE RESERVE EFFECTIVENESS, INCLUDING DISTANCE-BASED AND ECOLOGICAL METRICS OF CONNECTIVITY AMONG RESERVES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INCREASED CONNECTIVITY AND DEPTH IMPROVE THE AFOREMENTIONED MARINE RESERVE BENEFITS AND THAT THESE FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO OPTIMIZE SUCH BENEFITS OVER TIME. WE PROVIDE IMPORTANT GUIDANCE ON FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN IMPLEMENTING MARINE RESERVES FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCREASING THE ABUNDANCE AND SIZE OF FISHED SPECIES, GIVEN THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN COVERAGE GLOBALLY. WE SHOW THAT MARINE RESERVES THAT ARE HIGHLY PROTECTED (NO-TAKE) AND DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE CONNECTIVITY, SIZE AND DEPTH RANGE CAN PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION STRATEGY FOR FISHED SPECIES IN TEMPERATE AND TROPICAL WATERS WITHIN AN OVERARCHING MARINE BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION FRAMEWORK. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

INDIC.,1,"THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE USE OF AND SUGGEST POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENTS TO INDICATORS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS FOR LCA PROPOSED BY CHAUDHARY AND BOOKS (2018). FOR THIS, WE ANALYZED SOYBEAN PRODUCTION IN BRAZIL. POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO BIODIVERSITY HAS BEEN DETERMINED FOR ALL BRAZILIAN ECOREGIONS: THE AMAZON; THE ATLANTIC FOREST; CAATINGA; CERRADO; PAMPAS; AND THE PANTANAL. TWO DIMENSIONS OF ASSESSMENT WERE CONSIDERED – GLOBAL AND REGIONAL – IN ADDITION TO AVERAGE-COUNTRY. AN ADJUSTMENT WAS PROPOSED FOR THE VULNERABILITY COEFFICIENT TO THE INDICATORS AVERAGE-COUNTRY BRAZIL: THE REGIONAL SPECIES FRAGILITY INDEX (FI). TWO INVENTORIES WERE CREATED USING TWO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL UNITS: AREA OF PRODUCTION OF SOYBEAN BY ECOREGION (YEAR M2); AND AREA CORRESPONDING TO PRODUCTION OF 1 KG OF SOYBEAN (YEAR M2). THUS, WE OBSERVED THAT WHEN THE INDICATORS OF AGGREGATE VALUES WERE ADOPTED, THE ATLANTIC FOREST WAS THE ECOREGION MOST AFFECTED BY THE CROP. REGARDING THE ASSESSMENTS OF THE POTENTIAL BIODIVERSITY DAMAGE (BD) GLOBAL AND REGIONAL INDICATORS, THE ATLANTIC FOREST AND THE AMAZON WERE THE ECOREGIONS THAT SUFFERED THE HIGHEST IMPACTS, MAINLY ON PLANTS, BIRDS AND AMPHIBIANS TAXA. BESIDES, THE IMPACTS AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL WERE ALWAYS MORE EXPRESSIVE THAN THE REGIONAL ONES. DUE TO THIS, WE NOTICED THAT THE RESULTS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE VULNERABILITY SCORE (VS). THE SUITABILITY OF THE VS FOR FI IS RELEVANT AND THE ADJUSTMENT IN THE EQUATION CAN BE SUGGESTED FOR OTHER REGIONS. CONSIDERING THE RESULTS FOUND HERE, TO PREVENT REGIONAL IMPACTS, TECHNICAL MEASURES SUCH AS EXTENSIVE FARMING AND CROP ROTATION SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED AS IMPACT MITIGATION ACTIONS. HOWEVER, POLITICAL MEASURES TEND TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AT GEOGRAPHIC LEVELS WHEN ADDRESSING MORE THAN ONE ECOREGION, DUE TO THE STANDARDIZATION OF PRESERVATION PROCEDURES. THUS, FROM THE RESULTS REPORTED HERE, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE FI IS RELEVANT TO DIAGNOSE MEASURES AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE GEOGRAPHIC LEVELS OF THE ECOREGIONS PRESENT IN A SINGLE COUNTRY, AND THE APPLIED INDICATORS REINFORCE THAT THE ATLANTIC FOREST ECOREGION IS THE MOST VULNERABLE DUE TO THE REPLACEMENT OF WILD FOREST FOR CULTIVATED AREAS, WHICH INCLUDES SOYBEAN CROPS. © 2021 THE AUTHORS",107809,NA,NA,"LUCAS, K.R.G.; UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE LONDRINA – UEL, RODOVIA CELSO GARCIA CID, BRAZIL; EMAIL: KASSIORGL@HOTMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107809,NA,1470160X,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,ENGLISH,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,USING THE AVAILABLE INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL BIODIVERSITY DAMAGE FOR LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT ON SOYBEAN CROP ACCORDING TO BRAZILIAN ECOREGIONS,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106248164&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolind.2021.107809&partnerID=40&md5=056ea11923b99b7bc6ed4a17d1567bb2,127,2021,NA NA NA,ECOL INDIC,none,UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE LONDRINA – UEL;INSTITUT DE RECERCA I TECNOLOGIA AGROALIMENTÀRIES – IRTA;UNIVERSITAT ROVIRA I VIRIGILI – URV,NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE LONDRINA – UEL;NOTREPORTED,NA,"LUCAS KRG, 2021, ECOL INDIC","LUCAS KRG, 2021, ECOL INDIC"

INDIC.,1,"WITH ABUNDANT RESOURCES IN THE WETLAND, THE YELLOW RIVER DELTA PROVIDES IMPORTANT HABITATS FOR VARIOUS KINDS OF RARE BIRD SPECIES. HOWEVER, DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN WATER WITHDRAWAL ACTIVITIES, NO-FLOW EVENTS OF THE YELLOW RIVER OCCURRED FREQUENTLY SINCE THE 1970S, RESULTING IN SERIOUS WETLAND DEGRADATION AND BIODIVERSITY LOSSES. ECOLOGICAL WATER SUPPLEMENT HAS BEEN REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO COPE WITH THESE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. ACCORDINGLY, HOW MUCH WATER IS REQUIRED FOR THE ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION BECOMES AN ESSENTIAL QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED. SINCE THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE YELLOW RIVER DELTA NATURAL RESERVE (YRDNR), THE TYPICAL WETLAND IN THE YELLOW RIVER DELTA, IS TO PROVIDE SUITABLE HABITATS FOR VARIOUS RARE BIRDS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROPOSE A METHOD BASED ON WATER BALANCE ANALYSIS TO SPECIFY MONTHLY ECOLOGICAL WATER SUPPLEMENT FOR THE HABITATS OF TYPICAL BIRDS IN THE YRDNR. SPECIFICALLY, THREE TYPICAL BIRDS WERE SELECTED AS THE PROTECTION OBJECTS, INCLUDING GRUS JAPONENSIS, CICONIA BOYCIANA, AND LARUS SAUNDERSI. MONTHLY WATER SUPPLEMENT WAS DETERMINED BY MONTHLY LONG-TERM TIME SERIES DATA (2003–2018) OF EVAPOTRANSPIRATION PRODUCT DERIVED FROM REMOTE SENSING AND METEOROLOGICAL DATA (PRECIPITATION AND PAN EVAPORATION) ACQUIRED FROM NATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION CENTER. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ANNUAL ECOLOGICAL WATER SUPPLEMENT FOR 10 KM2 IDEAL HABITATS WAS 666.17×104 M3, 1165.22×104 M3, AND 664.48×104 M3 FOR G. JAPONENSIS, C. BOYCIANA, AND L. SAUNDERSI, RESPECTIVELY. BESIDES, IT WAS FOUND THAT ANNUAL PRECIPITATION GENERALLY HAD A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE RELATION WITH ANNUAL ECOLOGICAL WATER SUPPLEMENT, WHICH SUGGESTED THAT LOCAL PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A KEY FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF ANNUAL WATER SUPPLEMENT. THE FREQUENCY ANALYSIS WAS THEN IMPLEMENTED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE SCHEME OF ACTUAL ECOLOGICAL WATER SUPPLEMENT UNDER DIFFERENT PRECIPITATION SCENARIOS. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT ANNUAL ECOLOGICAL WATER SUPPLEMENT FOR THE WHOLE YRDNR WAS 1.81×108 M3, 1.94×108 M3, 2.10×108 M3 AND 2.25×108 M3 RESPECTIVELY UNDER WET, AVERAGE, DRY AND EXTREME DRY CONDITIONS.

LAND COVER REPRESENTATIONS LACK THE REPRESENTATION OF LAND USE AND LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS RELEVANT TO BIODIVERSITY MODELING. OBJECTIVES: WE DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE AND HIGH-RESOLUTION REPRESENTATION OF EUROPEAN LAND SYSTEMS ON A 1-KM2 GRID INTEGRATING IMPORTANT LAND USE AND LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS. METHODS: COMBINING THE RECENT DATA ON LAND COVER AND LAND USE INTENSITIES, WE APPLIED AN EXPERT-BASED HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFICATION APPROACH AND IDENTIFIED LAND SYSTEMS THAT ARE COMMON IN EUROPE AND MEANINGFUL FOR STUDYING BIODIVERSITY. WE TESTED THE BENEFITS OF USING THIS MAP AS COMPARED TO LAND COVER INFORMATION TO PREDICT THE DISTRIBUTION OF BIRD SPECIES HAVING DIFFERENT VULNERABILITY TO LANDSCAPE AND LAND USE CHANGE. RESULTS: NEXT TO LANDSCAPES DOMINATED BY ONE LAND COVER, MOSAIC LANDSCAPES COVER 14.5% OF EUROPEAN TERRESTRIAL SURFACE. WHEN USING THE LAND SYSTEM MAP, SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS DEMONSTRATE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER PREDICTIVE ABILITY (UP TO 19% HIGHER) AS COMPARED TO MODELS BASED ON LAND COVER MAPS. OUR MAP CONSISTENTLY CONTRIBUTES MORE TO THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE TESTED SPECIES THAN THE USE OF LAND COVER DATA (3.9 TO 39.1% HIGHER). CONCLUSIONS: A LAND SYSTEMS CLASSIFICATION INCLUDING ESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF LANDSCAPE AND LAND MANAGEMENT INTO A CONSISTENT CLASSIFICATION CAN IMPROVE UPON TRADITIONAL LAND COVER MAPS IN LARGE-SCALE BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT.

HOWEVER, MANY PAS DO NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTION DUE TO POOR FUNDING, INADEQUATE STAFFING AND EQUIPMENT, AND INEFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT. AS PART OF CHINA'S RECENT ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED INVESTMENT IN NATURE RESERVES OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, PROVIDING A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE WHETHER PAS CAN PROTECT THREATENED SPECIES EFFECTIVELY. WE COMPILED DATA FROM PUBLISHED LITERATURE ON POPULATIONS OF GIBBONS (HYLOBATIDAE), A THREATENED TAXON WITH CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE, THAT OCCURRED IN CHINESE RESERVES AFTER 1980. WE EVALUATED THE ABILITY OF THESE PAS TO MAINTAIN GIBBON HABITAT AND POPULATIONS BY COMPARING FOREST COVER AND HUMAN DISTURBANCE BETWEEN RESERVES AND THEIR SURROUNDING AREAS AND MODELING THE IMPACT OF RESERVE CHARACTERISTICS ON GIBBON POPULATION TRENDS. WE ALSO ASSESSED THE PERSPECTIVE OF RESERVE STAFF CONCERNING PA MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS THROUGH AN ONLINE SURVEY. RESERVES EFFECTIVELY PROTECTED GIBBON HABITAT BY REDUCING FOREST LOSS AND HUMAN DISTURBANCE; HOWEVER, HALF THE RESERVES LOST THEIR GIBBON POPULATIONS SINCE BEING ESTABLISHED. GIBBONS WERE MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE IN RESERVES ESTABLISHED MORE RECENTLY, AT HIGHER ELEVATION, WITH LESS FOREST LOSS AND LOWER HUMAN IMPACT, AND THAT HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY WELL STUDIED. A LARGER INITIAL POPULATION SIZE IN THE 1980S WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH GIBBON PERSISTENCE. ALTHOUGH STAFF OF ALL RESERVES REPORTED INCREASED INVESTMENT AND IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OVER THE PAST 20–30 YEARS, NO RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND GIBBON POPULATION TRENDS.

DESPITE THE BENEFITS OF AQUACULTURE, THE RAPID GROWTH AND INTENSIFICATION OF PRODUCTION (SO-CALLED CONVENTIONAL AQUACULTURE) HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT FOOD SAFETY, FISH WELFARE, AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES STEMMING FROM A TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS. THESE CONCERNS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO ENABLE SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE DEVELOPMENT.

THIS REGION HARBORS TWO SPECIES OF GEOGRAPHICALLY SEPARATED BROWN BEAR (URSUS ARCTOS) - THE TIBETAN (U. A. PRUINOSUS) AND HIMALAYAN BROWN BEAR (U. A. ISABELLINUS). BOTH SERVE AS IMPORTANT UMBRELLA SPECIES, PROVIDING MANY ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS TO THEIR SURROUNDING ECOSYSTEMS. HOWEVER, HOW THESE TWO SPECIES FROM THE SAME TAXONOMIC GROUP BUT WITH DISTINCT GEOGRAPHICAL RANGES, WILL RESPOND TO CLIMATE AND LAND USE CHANGE IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO PREDICT THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF FUTURE CLIMATE AND LAND USE CHANGE ON THE DISTRIBUTION AND DISPERSAL PATHS OF TIBETAN AND HIMALAYAN BROWN BEARS IN THE HKH REGION. WE APPLIED MAXENT MODELING TO PREDICT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TWO BEAR SPECIES BOTH CURRENTLY AND FOR THE YEAR 2070, USING THREE GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS AND THREE SCENARIOS OF CLIMATE AND LAND USE CHANGE. WE THEN IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL DISPERSAL PATHS USING CIRCUIT THEORY. RESULTS SHOWED THAT BOTH SPECIES WOULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE CLIMATE AND LAND USE CHANGE EXPECTED IN THE 2070S. IN ALL THREE CLIMATE SCENARIOS, THEIR DISTRIBUTION AREAS WOULD BOTH SHRINK AND SHIFT TO HIGHER ALTITUDES. THROUGHOUT THE HKH REGION, TIBETAN AND HIMALAYAN BROWN BEARS WERE PREDICTED TO LOSE OVER 34% AND 32% OF CURRENTLY INHABITED AREA UNDER THE MOST SEVERE CLIMATE SCENARIO, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE DENSITY OF DISPERSAL PATHS FOR TIBETAN BROWN BEAR WOULD DECREASE WHILE DISPERSAL RESISTANCE WOULD INCREASE, AND THAT DISPERSAL PATHS FOR HIMALAYAN BROWN BEARS WOULD SHIFT TO HIGHER LATITUDES. TO PROTECT THESE SPECIES, THE CURRENTLY SUITABLE DISTRIBUTION AREAS AND DISPERSAL PATHS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS PRIORITY PROTECTED AREAS.

YET, A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS AND EXTENT OF COMMUNITY REORGANIZATION REMAINS ELUSIVE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN RIVERINE SYSTEMS, WHICH ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPOSED TO CHANGING TEMPERATURE AND STREAMFLOW, AND WHERE LAND-USE CHANGE CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR DRIVER OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS. HERE, WE USE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE COMPILATION OF FISH ABUNDANCE TIME SERIES TO DATE TO PROVIDE A GLOBAL SYNTHESIS OF CLIMATE- AND LU-INDUCED EFFECTS ON RIVERINE BIOTA WITH RESPECT TO CHANGES IN SPECIES THERMAL AND STREAMFLOW AFFINITIES. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT FISH COMMUNITIES ARE INCREASINGLY DOMINATED BY THERMOPHILIC (WARM-WATER) AND LIMNOPHILIC (SLOW-WATER) SPECIES. DESPITE BEING CONSISTENT WITH TRENDS IN WATER TEMPERATURE AND STREAMFLOW OBSERVED OVER RECENT DECADES, THESE COMMUNITY CHANGES APPEAR LARGELY DECOUPLED FROM EACH OTHER AND SHOW WIDE SPATIAL VARIATION. WE FURTHER REVEAL A SYNERGY AMONG CLIMATE- AND LAND USE-RELATED DRIVERS, SUCH THAT COMMUNITY THERMOPHILIZATION IS HEIGHTENED IN MORE HUMAN-MODIFIED SYSTEMS. IMPORTANTLY, COMMUNITIES IN WHICH SPECIES EXPERIENCE THERMAL AND FLOW REGIMES THAT APPROACH OR EXCEED THEIR TOLERANCE THRESHOLDS (HIGH COMMUNITY SENSITIVITY), AS WELL AS SPECIES-POOR COMMUNITIES (LOW COMMUNITY RESILIENCE), ALSO DISPLAY FASTER RATES OF COMPOSITIONAL CHANGE. THIS RESEARCH ILLUSTRATES THAT QUANTIFYING VULNERABILITY OF RIVERINE SYSTEMS TO CLIMATE CHANGE REQUIRES A BROADENING FROM A NARROWER THERMAL FOCUS TO MORE INTEGRATIVE APPROACHES THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE SPATIALLY VARYING AND MULTIFACETED SENSITIVITY OF RIVERINE ORGANISMS TO THE INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF WATER TEMPERATURE, HYDROLOGY, AND OTHER ANTHROPOGENIC CHANGES. © 2021 NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.

HOWEVER, CREATED OR RESTORED WETLANDS COULD PARTIALLY MITIGATE AQUATIC BIODIVERSITY LOSS BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE HABITAT ACROSS A LANDSCAPE. WE INVESTIGATED THE IMPACT OF SURROUNDING TERRESTRIAL HABITAT AND WATER QUALITY VARIABLES ON SUITABILITY FOR TWO SPECIES OF POND-BREEDING AMPHIBIANS (BULLFROGS [LITHOBATES CATESBEIANUS] AND BLANCHARD'S CRICKET FROGS [ACRIS BLANCHARDI]) IN CREATED PERMANENT WETLANDS LOCATED ON AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE. WE EXAMINED TADPOLE GROWTH AND SURVIVAL IN FIELD ENCLOSURES PLACED IN PONDS SURROUNDED BY AGRICULTURAL, FORESTED, OR GRASSLAND HABITATS. WE ALSO EVALUATED THE POTENTIAL FOR CARRYOVER EFFECTS OF THE AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT ON TERRESTRIAL GROWTH AND OVERWINTER SURVIVAL OF CRICKET FROG METAMORPHS. WE FOUND THAT HABITAT ADJACENT TO PONDS DID NOT PREDICT TADPOLE GROWTH OR SURVIVAL. RATHER, PHYTOPLANKTON ABUNDANCE, WHICH SHOWED HIGH VARIABILITY AMONG PONDS WITHIN HABITAT TYPE, WAS THE ONLY PREDICTOR OF TADPOLE GROWTH. CRICKET FROGS EMERGED LARGER AND EARLIER FROM PONDS WITH HIGHER PHYTOPLANKTON ABUNDANCE; BULLFROGS WERE ALSO LARGER AND AT A MORE ADVANCED DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE IN PONDS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF PHYTOPLANKTON.

BEHAVIORAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENTS MAY ENHANCE A POPULATION’S ABILITY TO COPE WITH ANTHROPOGENIC HAZARDS. WE EXAMINED POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE BEHAVIORAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PHENOTYPE OF POPULATIONS OF THE NEOTROPICAL WEDGE-BILLED WOODCREEPER (GLYPHORYNCHUS SPIRURUS)—AN UNDERSTORY FOREST SPECIALIST INSECTIVOROUS BIRD—BETWEEN POPULATIONS FROM URBAN FRAGMENTED FORESTS AND CONTINUOUS PRESERVED FORESTS. WE EVALUATED EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOR AND MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS USING GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS AND LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS TO QUANTIFY PHENOTYPICAL DIFFERENCES AMONG POPULATIONS. WE USED FAILURE TIME ANALYSIS TO COMPARE LATENCY TO EXPLORE AND MOVE DURING EXPLORATION IN A NOVEL ENVIRONMENT TEST (NET). OUR ANALYSES DETECTED DIFFERENCES IN CERTAIN MOVEMENT BEHAVIORS (LATENCIES TO MOVE DURING NET), INDICATING THAT INDIVIDUALS FROM FRAGMENTED FORESTS ARE SLOW EXPLORERS IN RELATION TO INDIVIDUALS FROM THE CONTINUOUS FOREST. WE ALSO FOUND SHORTER TARSI AND TAILS IN THE FRAGMENTED FOREST POPULATION WHICH WERE ATTRIBUTED TO AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN BODY SIZE IN THESE POPULATIONS.

THE LIMITED RESEARCH THAT IS AVAILABLE SUGGESTS THAT ENCLOSURE DESIGN (STRUCTURE, PLANTING AND NATURALISTIC THEMING) HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE TIME THAT AMPHIBIANS WILL BE ON SHOW TO VISITORS. HOWEVER, THE CATEGORISATION OF ANY “VISITOR EFFECT” (I.E., INFLUENCES OF VISITOR PRESENCE ON AMPHIBIAN ACTIVITY AND TIME ON DISPLAY) IS HARD TO FIND. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FORCED THE CLOSURE OF ZOOLOGICAL ORGANISATIONS IN THE UK FOR SEVERAL MONTHS FROM MARCH 2020, WITH GRADUAL RE-OPENINGS FROM THE SUMMER INTO AUTUMN AND WINTER. THIS EVENT PROVIDED A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF THE LACK OF VISITORS, THE PRESENCE OF ESSENTIAL ZOO STAFF ONLY, THE WIDER RETURN OF ORGANISATIONAL STAFF, AND THEN THE RETURN OF VISITORS OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD. THIS PROJECT AT WWT SLIMBRIDGE WETLANDS CENTRE ASSESSED THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS OF SIX SPECIES OF AMPHIBIAN—COMMON TOAD (BUFO BUFO), COMMON FROG (RANA TEMPORARIA), SMOOTH NEWT (LISSOTRITON VULGARIS), POOL FROG (PELOPHYLAX LESSONAE), GOLDEN MANTELLA (MANTELLA AURANTIACA) AND GOLDEN POISON DART FROG (PHYLLOBATES TERRIBILIS)—VISIBLE TO OBSERVERS UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. ALL AMPHIBIANS WERE HOUSED IN A PURPOSE-BUILT INDOOR EXHIBIT OF INDIVIDUAL ENCLOSURES AND WERE RECORDED WHEN VISIBLE (AS A PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF THE ENCLOSURE) DURING CLOSURE, THE RETURN OF EXTRA CENTRE STAFF AND VISITOR PERIODS. THE RESULTS SHOWED SPECIES-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN VISIBILITY, WITH SOME SPECIES OF AMPHIBIAN BEING MORE LIKELY TO BE ON VIEW WHEN THE PRESENCE OF PEOPLE AT THEIR ENCLOSURE WAS LESS LIKELY OR IN SMALLER NUMBERS. SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE LIKELY RELATED TO THE SPECIFIC CAMOUFLAGE OR ANTI-PREDATION TACTICS IN THESE FOCAL SPECIES.

AS IT IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT ITS BURDEN IS EXPECTED TO SHIFT SPATIALLY WITH GLOBAL ANTHROPOGENIC ENVIRONMENTAL (CLIMATE, LAND USE) AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE. THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE CHANGES TO SNAKEBITE EPIDEMIOLOGY ARE RELATED TO FACTORS OF SNAKES AND HUMANS. THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF SNAKES ARE EXPECTED TO CHANGE WITH GLOBAL WARMING VIA THEIR THERMAL TOLERANCE, WHILE RAINFALL MAY AFFECT THE TIMING OF KEY ACTIVITIES LIKE FEEDING AND REPRODUCTION. HUMAN POPULATION GROWTH IS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF LAND-USE CHANGE, WHICH MAY IMPACT SNAKES AT SMALLER SPATIAL SCALES THAN CLIMATE VIA HABITAT AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS (E.G. PREY AVAILABILITY). HUMAN POPULATIONS, ON THE OTHER HAND, COULD EXPERIENCE NOVEL PATTERNS AND MORBIDITY OF SNAKEBITE ENVENOMING, BOTH AS A RESULT OF SNAKE RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURAL ADAPTATIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE, SOCIOECONOMIC AND CULTURAL CHANGES, DEVELOPMENT AND AVAILABILITY OF BETTER ANTIVENOMS, PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, AND MECHANIZATION OF AGRICULTURE THAT MEDIATE RISK OF ENCOUNTERS WITH SNAKES AND THEIR OUTCOMES. THE LIKELY GLOBAL EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE ARE THUS CONTEXT-DEPENDENT AND COULD ENCOMPASS BOTH INCREASING AND OR SNAKEBITE BURDEN (INCIDENCE, NUMBER OF CASES OR MORBIDITY), EXPOSING NEW POPULATIONS TO SNAKES IN TEMPERATE AREAS DUE TO “TROPICALIZATION”, OR BY LAND USE CHANGE-INDUCED SNAKE BIODIVERSITY LOSS, RESPECTIVELY.

RES.,1,"CONTEXT: INVASIVE SPECIES ARE A MAJOR CAUSE OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS ACROSS MUCH OF THE WORLD, AND A KEY THREAT TO AUSTRALIA'S DIVERSE REPTILE FAUNA. THERE HAS BEEN NO PREVIOUS COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCED EUROPEAN RED FOX, VULPES VULPES, ON AUSTRALIAN REPTILES. AIMS: WE SEEK TO PROVIDE AN INVENTORY OF ALL AUSTRALIAN REPTILE SPECIES KNOWN TO BE CONSUMED BY THE FOX, AND IDENTIFY CHARACTERISTICS OF SQUAMATE SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH PREDATION. WE ALSO COMPARE THESE TALLIES AND CHARACTERISTICS WITH REPTILE SPECIES KNOWN TO BE CONSUMED BY THE DOMESTIC CAT, FELIS CATUS, TO EXAMINE WHETHER PREDATION BY THESE TWO INTRODUCED SPECIES IS COMPOUNDED (I.E. AFFECTING MUCH THE SAME SET OF SPECIES) OR COMPLEMENTARY (AFFECTING DIFFERENT GROUPS OF SPECIES). METHODS: WE COLLATED RECORDS OF AUSTRALIAN REPTILES CONSUMED BY FOXES IN AUSTRALIA, WITH MOST RECORDS DERIVING FROM FOX DIETARY STUDIES (TALLYING >35 000 SAMPLES). WE MODELLED PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF FOX PREDATION RECORDS AGAINST A SET OF BIOLOGICAL AND OTHER TRAITS, AND POPULATION TRENDS, FOR SQUAMATE SPECIES. KEY RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 108 REPTILE SPECIES (∼11% OF AUSTRALIA'S TERRESTRIAL REPTILE FAUNA) HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS CONSUMED BY FOXES, FEWER THAN THAT REPORTED FOR CATS (263 SPECIES). EIGHTY-SIX SPECIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO BE EATEN BY BOTH PREDATORS. MORE AUSTRALIAN TURTLE SPECIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS CONSUMED BY FOXES THAN BY CATS, INCLUDING MANY THAT SUFFER HIGH LEVELS OF PREDATION ON EGG CLUTCHES. TWENTY THREATENED REPTILE SPECIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS CONSUMED BY FOXES, AND 15 BY CATS. SQUAMATE SPECIES CONSUMED BY FOXES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE UNDERGOING POPULATION DECLINE THAN THOSE NOT KNOWN TO BE CONSUMED BY FOXES. THE LIKELIHOOD OF PREDATION BY FOXES INCREASED WITH SQUAMATE SPECIES' ADULT BODY MASS, IN CONTRAST TO THE RELATIONSHIP FOR PREDATION BY CATS, WHICH PEAKED AT ∼217 G. FOXES, BUT NOT CATS, WERE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO CONSUME VENOMOUS SNAKES. CONCLUSIONS: THE TWO INTRODUCED, AND NOW WIDESPREAD, PREDATORS HAVE BOTH COMPOUNDING AND COMPLEMENTARY IMPACTS ON THE AUSTRALIAN REPTILE FAUNA. IMPLICATIONS: ENHANCED AND INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF THE TWO INTRODUCED PREDATORS IS LIKELY TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL CONSERVATION BENEFITS TO MUCH OF THE AUSTRALIAN REPTILE FAUNA. © 2021 JOURNAL COMPILATION",NA,NA,WRESE,"STOBO-WILSON, A.M.; NESP THREATENED SPECIES RECOVERY HUB, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: ALYSON.STOBOWILSON@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1071/WR20194,HOLSWORTH WILDLIFE RESEARCH ENDOWMENTHOLSWORTH WILDLIFE RESEARCH ENDOWMENT,10353712,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,ENGLISH,NA,NA,7,5,470-480,CSIRO,NA,SCOPUS,REPTILES AS FOOD: PREDATION OF AUSTRALIAN REPTILES BY INTRODUCED RED FOXES COMPOUNDS AND COMPLEMENTS PREDATION BY CATS,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106643041&doi=10.1071%2fWR20194&partnerID=40&md5=304619b03d22c19056ebd2e6e0fe7ac0,48,2021,"THIS RESEARCH RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT’S NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE PROGRAM THROUGH THE THREATENED SPECIES RECOVERY HUB.

WE ESTIMATED REPTILE SPECIES’ RANGE OVERLAP WITH DRYLAND CROPPING AND MODIFIED PASTORAL REGIONS WITHIN THE AUSTRALIAN WHEAT-SHEEP ZONE TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF ROCK CRUSHING PRACTICES. WE EXAMINED SPECIES- AND FAMILY-RICHNESS WITHIN THE IMPACT ZONE AND ACROSS BIOREGIONS WITHIN THE IMPACT ZONE, TO IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE ROCK REMOVAL HAS THE GREATEST POTENTIAL TO IMPACT TERRESTRIAL AND FOSSORIAL SQUAMATES. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT 159 POTENTIALLY IMPACTED REPTILE SPECIES OCCUR WITHIN THE STUDY AREA, REPRESENTING 16% OF AUSTRALIAN TERRESTRIAL SQUAMATES.

DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF METHODS FOR AUTOMATED CONTENT ANALYSIS OF DIGITAL DATA SOURCES ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THE CONTEXT OF INVESTIGATING HUMAN–NATURE INTERACTIONS. IN THIS STUDY, WE INTRODUCE NOVEL APPLICATION METHODS TO AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT AND ANALYSE TEXTUAL DATA ON SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN FROM DIGITAL PLATFORMS. AN END-TO-END PIPELINE IS CONSTRUCTED THAT BEGINS FROM SEARCHING AND DOWNLOADING NEWS ARTICLES ABOUT SPECIES LISTED IN APPENDIX I OF THE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES OF WILD FAUNA AND FLORA (CITES) ALONG WITH NEWS ARTICLES FROM SPECIFIC TWITTER HANDLES AND PROCEEDS WITH IMPLEMENTING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING METHODS TO FILTER AND RETAIN ONLY RELEVANT ARTICLES. A CRUCIAL ASPECT HERE IS THE AUTOMATIC ANNOTATION OF TRAINING DATA, WHICH CAN BE CHALLENGING IN MANY MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS. A NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION MODEL IS THEN USED TO EXTRACT ADDITIONAL RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR EACH ARTICLE. THE DATA COLLECTED OVER A 1-MONTH PERIOD INCLUDED 15,088 ARTICLES FOCUSING ON 585 SPECIES LISTED IN APPENDIX I OF CITES. THE ACCURACY OF THE NEURAL NETWORK TO DETECT RELEVANT ARTICLES WAS 95.91% WHILE THE NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION MODEL HELPED EXTRACT INFORMATION ON PRICES, LOCATION AND QUANTITIES OF TRADED ANIMALS AND PLANTS. A REGULARLY UPDATED DATABASE, WHICH CAN BE QUERIED AND ANALYSED FOR VARIOUS RESEARCH PURPOSES AND TO INFORM CONSERVATION DECISION MAKING, IS GENERATED BY THE SYSTEM.

TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PERTURBATIONS ON THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF THE BENTHIC COMMUNITIES, THE FAUNA AND THE SEDIMENTS RETRIEVED FROM A SHORT CORE IN THE MANZALA LAGOON, WHICH IS LARGEST IN THE NILE DELTA, WERE QUANTITATIVELY ANALYZED. THE 120 CM LONG-CORE REPRESENTS 170 YEARS. A SIGNIFICANT ECOSYSTEM SHIFT TOOK PLACE IN THE UPPER 41 CM OF THE LAGOON SEDIMENTS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO HYDRODYNAMIC CHANGES, ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF ASWAN HIGH-DAM, WHERE HEAVY METALS CONCENTRATIONS, POLLUTION LOAD INDEX (PLI), AND FINE-GRAIN SEDIMENTS WERE INCREASED. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF THE BENTHIC FAUNA WAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED. CURRENTLY, THE BENTHIC COMMUNITY IS DOMINATED BY BRACKISH AND OPPORTUNISTIC TAXA (E.G., FULVIA FRAGILIS, PIRENELLA CONICA, CORBICULA FLUMINALIS, AND MELANOIDES TUBERCULATA). IN CONTRAST, THE PRE-IMPACT COMMUNITY CONTAINS EQUILIBRIUM FRESHWATER SPECIES. THESE SALINITY-CONTROLLED COMMUNITIES WERE BETTER CHARACTERIZED ON BOTH BRAY-CURTIS -BASED CONSTRAINED CLUSTERING (CC) AND NON-METRIC MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING (NMDS). THE FAUNAL DENSITY AND DOMINANCE INDEX ARE HIGHER IN THE TOP SAMPLES, WHICH POINT EITHER TO ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE OR TAPHONOMIC (MECHANICAL OR CHEMICAL) DISTORTION WITH DEPTHS. HOWEVER, HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS IN LOWER SAMPLES SUGGESTED THAT THE MECHANICAL DISTORTION HAS NOT ALTERED THE ORIGINAL COMMUNITIES AND POINT TO ANTHROPOGENIC DRIVERS OF THE DIVERSITY LOSS. FURTHER DECLINING OR EVEN EXTINCTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM SPECIES IN THE FUTURE IS EXPECTED IF NO RESTORATION PROGRAMS IMPLEMENTED SOON. FURTHERMORE, NMDS AND RMA REGRESSION MODELS SHOWED THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF BENTHIC FAUNA IS GOVERNED BY ABIOTIC FACTORS (E.G., WATER SALINITY, METAL CONCENTRATIONS, AND SEDIMENT GRAIN-SIZE).

BACTERIA WERE THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPRESENTED PATHOGENS (112), FOLLOWED BY ECTOPARASITES (78), VIRUSES (69), PROTOZOA AND OTHER (65). THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF IAS ON NATIVE WILDLIFE ARE BEGINNING TO BE ADDRESSED IN SOUTH AMERICA, AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT AS PATHOGEN SPREADERS TO NATIVE WILDLIFE HAS REMAINED LARGELY UNEXPLORED. RISK ANALYSIS SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF IAS ARE SCARCE IN THIS REGION. ALTHOUGH THE EXISTING SYSTEMS CONTEMPLATE HAZARD ANALYSES FOR THE CO-INTRODUCTION OF PATHOGENS, THEY UNDERESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF DISEASES ON TNS. CONSERVATION EFFORTS IN THE REGION WOULD BENEFIT FROM SYSTEMS WHICH GIVE PATHOGEN RISK A RELEVANT PLACE, AND FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES PROMOTING TARGETED DISEASE SURVEILLANCE IN IAS AND WILDLIFE. © 2021, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG.",NA,NA,BLINF,"LA SALA, L.F.; INSTITUTO DE CIENCIAS BIOLÓGICAS Y BIOMÉDICAS DEL SUR (CONICET – UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DEL SUR)ARGENTINA; EMAIL: LUCIANOLASALA@CONICET.GOV.AR",ARTICLE,10.1007/s10530-021-02488-6,"CONSEJO NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTÍFICAS Y TÉCNICASCONSEJO NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTÍFICAS Y TÉCNICAS, CONICET UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DEL SURUNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DEL SUR, UNS",13873547,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,ENGLISH,NA,NA,4,7,2063-2076,SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA DEUTSCHLAND GMBH,NA,SCOPUS,TROJAN HOSTS: THE MENACE OF INVASIVE VERTEBRATES AS VECTORS OF PATHOGENS IN THE SOUTHERN CONE OF SOUTH AMERICA,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103240872&doi=10.1007%2fs10530-021-02488-6&partnerID=40&md5=6d622bb453aaa39c42f39a8d1077ad9a,23,2021,WE THANK UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DEL SUR AND CONICET FOR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND ANONYMOUS REVIEWERS FOR VERY HELPFUL COMMENTS ON THE MANUSCRIPT.

RELATIONSHIPS BECAME APPARENT BETWEEN COUNTRIES’ MONITORING QUALITY INDEX AND THEIR SUCCESS IN DETECTING CONTAMINANTS. ACROSS THE EU, CONTAMINANTS WERE MORE FREQUENTLY FOUND IN RECENT YEARS. OVERALL, 35.7% (N = 17,484) OF SITES EXCEEDED AT LEAST ONE ACUTE REGULATORY THRESHOLD LEVEL (RTL) EACH YEAR, AND AVERAGE RISKS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED OVER TIME FOR FISH (Τ = 0.498, P = 0.01) AND AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES (Τ = 0.429, P = 0.03). THIS INDICATES AN INCREASED CHEMICAL PRESSURE TO EUROPE'S WATERBODIES AND OVERALL LARGE-SCALE THRESHOLD EXCEEDANCES. PESTICIDES WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE MAIN RISK DRIVERS (>85% OF RTL EXCEEDANCES) WITH AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES BEING MOST ACUTELY AT RISK IN EUROPE.

IN PARTICULAR, THE LARGE-SCALE GLOBAL PLANT TRADE IS UNDER-REPORTED AND UNDER-RESEARCHED, AND THIS IS EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN THE TRADE TAKES PLACE WITHIN A COUNTRY’S BORDERS. A CLEAR EXAMPLE IS THE TRADE IN ORCHIDS, ALL SPECIES OF WHICH ARE LISTED BY THE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES OF WILD FAUNA AND FLORA (CITES). ALTHOUGH COUNTRIES SUCH AS VIET NAM ARE KNOWN HOTSPOTS FOR THE LARGE-SCALE COLLECTION OF WILD ORCHIDS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL HORTICULTURAL TRADE, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW PLANTS MOVE FROM THE WILD TO THE END-CONSUMER, WHAT ROLE IS PLAYED BY DOMESTIC MARKETS AND THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS TRADE. WE USE A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE STRUCTURE OF TRADE CHAINS FOR ORCHIDS IN KEY TRADING AREAS OF NORTHERN VIET NAM, AND USE A THEMATIC FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY FIVE GROUPS OF ACTORS TRADING WILD-HARVESTED ORCHIDS. TRADE OCCURS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, UNDERPINNED BY DEMAND FOR RARE, WILD PLANTS. AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TO ADDRESS THE ILLEGAL AND UNSUSTAINABLE PLANT TRADE IS TO RECOGNISE IT AS A MAJOR AND GROWING CONSERVATION ISSUE, AND DEVELOP DIVERSE APPROACHES THAT CONSIDER THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SUPPLY CHAINS INVOLVED. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE SCALE AND PROCESS OF DOMESTIC TRADE IS UNDERSTOOD, AND ITS IMPACT ON LONG TERM CONSERVATION OF THESE SPECIES ASSESSED TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FULL SUPPLY CHAIN. © COPYRIGHT © 2021 BULLOUGH, NGUYỄN, DRURY AND HINSLEY.",631795,NA,NA,"BULLOUGH, L.-A.; INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERUNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: LEIGH.ANNE.BULLOUGH@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.3389/fevo.2021.631795,NA,2296701X,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,FRONTIERS MEDIA S.A.,NA,SCOPUS,ORCHID OBSCURITY: UNDERSTANDING DOMESTIC TRADE IN WILD-HARVESTED ORCHIDS IN VIET NAM,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109775323&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2021.631795&partnerID=40&md5=904c806ed75158012fe8bc22923a5034,9,2021,"FUNDING FOR THE IN-COUNTRY DATA COLLECTION OF THIS STUDY WAS PROVIDED BY THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY COKE TRUST BURSARY FUND 2018.

IT IS NOW BECOMING EVIDENT THAT RESTORING THESE ALTERED FOOD WEBS REQUIRES ADDRESSING NOT ONLY ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES, BUT EVOLUTIONARY ONES AS WELL, BECAUSE HUMAN-INDUCED RAPID EVOLUTION MAY IN TURN AFFECT ECOLOGICAL DYNAMICS. WE STUDIED THE POTENTIAL FOR NICHE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT PLATE ARMOR PHENOTYPES IN A RAPIDLY EXPANDING POPULATION OF A SMALL PREY FISH, THE THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK (GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS). IN THE CENTRAL BALTIC SEA, THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK ABUNDANCE HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY DURING THE PAST DECADES. THE INCREASE IN THIS TYPICAL MESOPREDATOR HAS RESTRUCTURED NEAR-SHORE FOOD WEBS, INCREASED FILAMENTOUS ALGAL BLOOMS, AND THREATENS COASTAL BIODIVERSITY. TIME-SERIES DATA COVERING 22 YEARS SHOW THAT THE INCREASE COINCIDES WITH A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF JUVENILE PERCH (PERCA FLUVIATILIS), THE MOST ABUNDANT PREDATOR OF STICKLEBACK ALONG THE COAST. WE INVESTIGATED THE DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT STICKLEBACK PLATE ARMOR PHENOTYPES DEPENDING ON LATITUDE, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, PREDATOR AND PREY ABUNDANCES, NUTRIENTS, AND BENTHIC PRODUCTION; AND DESCRIBED THE STOMACH CONTENT OF THE STICKLEBACK PHENOTYPES USING METABARCODING. WE FOUND TWO DISTINCT LATERAL ARMOR PLATE PHENOTYPES OF STICKLEBACK, INCOMPLETELY AND COMPLETELY PLATED. THE PROPORTION OF INCOMPLETELY PLATED INDIVIDUALS INCREASED WITH INCREASING BENTHIC PRODUCTION AND DECREASING ABUNDANCES OF ADULT PERCH. METABARCODING SHOWED THAT THE STOMACH CONTENT OF THE COMPLETELY PLATED INDIVIDUALS MORE OFTEN CONTAINED INVERTEBRATE HERBIVORES (AMPHIPODS) THAN THE INCOMPLETELY PLATED ONES. SINCE ARMOR PLATES ARE DEFENSE STRUCTURES FAVORED BY NATURAL SELECTION IN THE PRESENCE OF FISH PREDATORS, THE PHENOTYPE DISTRIBUTION SUGGESTS THAT A NOVEL LOW-PREDATION REGIME FAVORS STICKLEBACK WITH LESS ARMOR. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MORPHOLOGICAL DIFFERENTIATION OF THE THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT FOOD WEB DYNAMICS AND INFLUENCE THE PERSISTENCE AND RESILIENCE OF THE STICKLEBACK TAKE-OVER IN THE BALTIC SEA. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.",E03561,NA,NA,"ERIKSSON, B.K.; GRONINGEN INSTITUTE FOR EVOLUTIONARY LIFE-SCIENCES, NIJENBORGH 7, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: B.D.H.K.ERIKSSON@RUG.NL",ARTICLE,10.1002/ecs2.3561,NA,21508925,ECOSPHERE,ENGLISH,NA,NA,4,6,NA,JOHN WILEY AND SONS INC,NA,SCOPUS,HABITAT SEGREGATION OF PLATE PHENOTYPES IN A RAPIDLY EXPANDING POPULATION OF THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108783618&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.3561&partnerID=40&md5=242358c071fce3ac6f5accf6f549c27a,12,2021,"WE THANK THE PROPERTY AND FISHING RIGHT OWNERS AROUND EACH OF THE 32 STUDY BAYS FOR FACILITATING THE FIELDWORK AND A NUMBER OF STUDENTS, VOLUNTEERS, AND FISH BIOLOGISTS FOR ASSISTANCE IN THE FIELD AND LABORATORY: E.

ALTHOUGH TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED AND IS CONSIDERED THE COMMON CURRENCY, SIMULTANEOUSLY CONSERVING OTHER FACETS OF DIVERSITY (E.G., FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY) IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING AND THE PROVISION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. HERE, WE EXPLORED THE EFFECT OF KEY CLIMATIC FACTORS (TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, TEMPERATURE SEASONALITY, AND PRECIPITATION SEASONALITY) AND FACTORS REFLECTING HUMAN PRESSURES (AGRICULTURAL LAND, URBAN LAND, LAND-COVER DIVERSITY, AND HUMAN POPULATION DENSITY) ON THE FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY. (FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS AND RAO’S QUADRATIC ENTROPY) AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF AMPHIBIANS (68 SPECIES), REPTILES (107 SPECIES), AND MAMMALS (176 SPECIES) IN EUROPE. WE EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIFFERENT PREDICTORS AND DIVERSITY METRICS USING GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS, TO CAPTURE NON-LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS AND TO ACCOUNT FOR SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION. WE FOUND THAT AT THIS BROAD CONTINENTAL SPATIAL SCALE, CLIMATIC VARIABLES EXERTED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF ALL TAXA. ON THE OTHER HAND, VARIABLES REFLECTING HUMAN PRESSURES CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE MODELS EVEN THOUGH THEIR EXPLANATORY POWER WAS LOWER COMPARED TO CLIMATIC VARIABLES. IN MOST CASES, FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS AND RAO’S QUADRATIC ENTROPY RESPONDED SIMILARLY TO CLIMATE AND HUMAN PRESSURES. IN CONCLUSION, CLIMATE IS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FACTOR IN SHAPING BOTH THE FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS PATTERNS OF AMPHIBIANS, REPTILES, AND MAMMALS IN EUROPE.

UNDERSTANDING HOW AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES CAN BE MORE BIODIVERSE IS CRITICAL IN DEVISING A WORKING LANDS CONSERVATION PLAN. FOR AT LEAST 20 YEARS, SOME BIRD POPULATIONS IN THE GALAPAGOS HAVE BEEN IN SHARP DECLINE, ESPECIALLY IN THE AGRICULTURAL ZONE. SINCE 2010, WE FOUND THAT THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF TEN OUT OF ELEVEN MONITORED LANDBIRD SPECIES HAS FURTHER DECREASED. WE EXAMINED THE EXISTING HABITAT STRUCTURES IN THE AGRICULTURAL ZONE OF SANTA CRUZ, HISTORICALLY ESTABLISHED IN FORMER AREAS OF NATIVE HUMID FOREST (SCALESIA), AND ANALYZED WHICH STRUCTURES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LANDBIRD DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF FOUR DECLINING SPECIES. WE CONDUCTED STANDARDIZED POINT COUNTS AND SURVEYED SURROUNDING VEGETATION DURING THE BREEDING PERIOD. LANDBIRD DIVERSITY WAS HIGHEST IN FOREST AND COFFEE SITES AND LEAST DIVERSE IN PASTURE SITES. MAIN PREDICTORS OF HIGHER LANDBIRD DIVERSITY WERE FOREST PATCH PRESENCE, INCREASED ABUNDANCE OF NATIVE VEGETATION AND LOWER ELEVATIONS. MAIN PREDICTORS OF HIGHER LANDBIRD RELATIVE ABUNDANCE WERE PERCENTAGE OF FOREST IN THE SURROUNDING 200 M RADIUS BUFFER AND FOREST PATCH PRESENCE.

IN SOUTH AFRICA, THE ARBOREAL SAMANGO MONKEY (CERCOPITHECUS ALBOGULARIS SP.) IS THREATENED DUE TO LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION OF THE INDIGENOUS FORESTS IT INHABITS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE HABITAT PREFERENCES OF THE SAMANGO MONKEY AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES, AND TO IDENTIFY KEY CONSERVATION AREAS TO INFORM MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR THIS SPECIES. LOCATION: THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE WESTERN SOUTPANSBERG MOUNTAINS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE NORTHERNMOST POPULATION OF SAMANGO MONKEYS WITHIN SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE ONLY ENDANGERED SUBSPECIES (C. A. SCHWARZI). METHODS: WE USED SEQUENTIALLY COLLECTED GPS POINTS FROM TWO SAMANGO MONKEY GROUPS FOLLOWED BETWEEN 2012 AND 2017 TO QUANTIFY THE USED AND AVAILABLE HABITAT FOR THIS SPECIES WITHIN THE WESTERN SOUTPANSBERG MOUNTAINS. WE DEVELOPED 2ND-ORDER (SELECTION OF RANGING AREA), 3RD-ORDER (SELECTION WITHIN RANGE), AND 4TH-ORDER (FEEDING SITE SELECTION) RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTIONS (RSFS) TO IDENTIFY IMPORTANT HABITAT FEATURES AT EACH SCALE. THROUGH SCALE INTEGRATION, WE IDENTIFIED THREE KEY CONSERVATION AREAS FOR SAMANGO MONKEYS ACROSS LIMPOPO PROVINCE, SOUTH AFRICA. RESULTS: HABITAT PRODUCTIVITY WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT LANDSCAPE VARIABLE PREDICTING PROBABILITY OF USE AT EACH ORDER OF SELECTION, INDICATING THE DEPENDENCE OF THESE ARBOREAL PRIMATES ON TALL-CANOPY INDIGENOUS FORESTS. CRITICAL HABITAT ACROSS LIMPOPO WAS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED, MEANING COMPLETE ISOLATION BETWEEN SUBPOPULATIONS IS LIKELY. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: UNDERSTANDING THE HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS THAT INFLUENCE SAMANGO MONKEY DISTRIBUTION ACROSS SOUTH AFRICA IS CRUCIAL FOR PRIORITIZING CRITICAL HABITAT FOR THIS SPECIES. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT LARGE, CONTIGUOUS PATCHES OF TALL-CANOPY INDIGENOUS FOREST ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO SAMANGO MONKEY PERSISTENCE. AS SUCH, PROTECTED AREA EXPANSION OF LARGE FOREST PATCHES AND CREATION OF FOREST CORRIDORS ARE IDENTIFIED AS KEY CONSERVATION INTERVENTIONS FOR THIS SPECIES. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

HERE, WE REPEATED A STUDY DONE IN 2003 TO ASSESS WHETHER INVESTMENTS IN ANTI-POACHING IN TWO PARTIALLY PAS (PPAS), GRUMETI GAME RESERVE (GGR) AND IKONA WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA (IWMA), HAVE HAD QUANTIFIABLE IMPACTS ON IMPALA (AEPYCEROS MELAMPUS) POPULATIONS, COMPARED TO THE ADJACENT STRICTLY PROTECTED SERENGETI NATIONAL PARK. SINCE 2003, MANAGEMENT OF THE PPAS HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY UNDER THE NON-PROFIT ORGANISATION GRUMETI FUND. WE PREDICTED THAT IF CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT HAD IMPROVED, IMPALA POPULATIONS IN 2018 WOULD HAVE HIGHER LOCAL DENSITY, LESS FEMALE-SKEWED SEX RATIO, LARGER GROUP SIZES, AND SHORTER FLIGHT INITIATION DISTANCES (FID). TO ASSESS THESE PARAMETERS OF THE IMPALA POPULATIONS, WE CONDUCTED THE SAME ROAD-BASED SURVEYS IN 2003 AND 2018. WE FOUND THAT COMPARED TO 2003, IMPALA POPULATION DENSITY DOUBLED IN GGR, GROUP SIZES WERE LARGER IN IWMA AND NEARLY DOUBLED IN GGR, AND THAT IMPALA HAD SHORTER FID IN IWMA IN 2018. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE CHANGES IN CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT COULD HAVE LED TO THE OBSERVED POSITIVE IMPACTS FOR IMPALA POPULATIONS.

WE DEFINE THE CONSERVATION STATUS ACCORDING TO CONSERVATION MEXICAN LAW, THE RED LIST OF INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE, AND ENVIRONMENTAL VULNERABILITY SCORES. WE DETERMINE THREAT PERCENTAGES ON ISLANDS ACCORDING TO THE 11 MAJOR CLASSES OF THREATS TO BIODIVERSITY. WE ESTIMATE THE NET TAXONOMIC TURNOVER WITH BETA DIVERSITY ANALYSIS BETWEEN THE NEARCTIC AND NEOTROPICAL PROVINCES. THE MEXICAN INSULAR HERPETOFAUNA IS COMPOSED OF 18 AMPHIBIAN SPECIES, 204 SPECIES WITH 101 SUBSPECIES OF REPTILES, AND 263 TAXA IN TOTAL. ENDEMISM LEVELS ARE 11.76% IN AMPHIBIANS, 53.57% IN REPTILES, AND 27.91% BEING INSULAR ENDEMIC TAXA. TWO CONSERVATION STATUS SYSTEMS CLASSIFY THE SPECIES AT HIGH EXTINCTION RISK, WHILE THE REMAINING SYSTEM SUGGESTS LESS CONCERN. HOWEVER, ALL SYSTEMS INDICATE SPECIES LACKING ASSESSMENT. HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND EXOTIC ALIEN SPECIES ARE PRESENT ON 60% OF 131 ISLANDS. THE TAXONOMIC TURNOVER VALUE IS HIGH (0.89), WITH A CLEAR HERPETOFAUNAL DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE TWO BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. THE SPECIES–AREA AND SPECIES–MAINLAND DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS ARE POSITIVE. INSULAR HERPETOFAUNA FACES A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THREATS, WITH THE NEOTROPICAL PROVINCES MORE HEAVILY IMPACTED.

THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE SEA TURTLES ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VESSEL STRIKES SINCE THEY SPEND SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THEIR LIVES IN NEARSHORE SHALLOW WATER TO BREATHE, REPRODUCE, AND FEED. TARGETED CONSERVATION STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE VESSEL STRIKES ON SEA TURTLES, AND SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION OF STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES IS NECESSARY FOR CONSERVATION SUCCESS. HERE, WE PRESENT RESULTS FROM A MULTI-STEP APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE RESPONSES TO POTENTIAL CONSERVATION INTERVENTIONS FOR REDUCING VESSEL STRIKES ON SEA TURTLES. FIRST, CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS THAT COULD BE USED TO REDUCE SEA TURTLE VESSEL STRIKES WERE DISCUSSED AND ASSESSED BY A WORKSHOP OF CONSERVATION AND ENFORCEMENT EXPERTS. SECOND, THE WORKSHOP-IDENTIFIED INTERVENTIONS WERE INCORPORATED INTO A SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE FOR RECREATIONAL BOATERS. THIRD, THIS FACE-TO-FACE SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED AROUND THE ST. LUCIE INLET, AN AREA IDENTIFIED AS A VESSEL STRIKE “HOT SPOT” IN FLORIDA (USA). THE QUESTIONNAIRE ASKED ABOUT BOATING PREFERENCES AND PRACTICES, EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CONSERVATION INTERVENTIONS, AND SEA TURTLE PRESENCE IN THE AREA. RESPONDENTS SUGGESTED THAT GREATER COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERVENTIONS WOULD BE OBTAINED IF THEY (1) WERE VOLUNTARY RATHER THAN MANDATORY/LEGISLATED, (2) OVERLAPPED WITH EXISTING INTERVENTIONS (E.G., IF SPEED MITIGATION ZONES FOR SEA TURTLES OVERLAPPED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH EXISTING SPEED REDUCTION ZONES FOR MANATEES) AND/OR ADDED MINIMAL NEW RESTRICTIONS AND INCONVENIENCES, AND (3) WERE ACCOMPANIED BY EXPLANATORY MATERIALS ON THE NEED FOR, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF, SUCH MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. BOATER BUY-IN FOR MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND COMPLIANCE CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. AS SUCH, OUR EXPLORATORY STUDY SHOULD BE REPLICATED WHERE PROPOSED SEA TURTLE CONSERVATION-RELATED STRATEGIES MIGHT BE WARRANTED TO ENSURE PROPER CONTEXTUAL FIT.

THE BALBINA HYDROELECTRIC DAM OF CENTRAL BRAZILIAN AMAZONIA INUNDATED 312,900 HA OF PRIMARY FORESTS AND CREATED APPROXIMATELY 3500 VARIABLE-SIZED ISLANDS THAT STILL HARBOR VERTEBRATE POPULATIONS AFTER NEARLY 3 DECADES AFTER ISOLATION. WE ESTIMATED THE SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE, BIOMASS, COMPOSITION, AND GROUP SIZE OF MEDIUM- TO LARGE-BODIED FOREST VERTEBRATES IN RESPONSE TO PATCH, LANDSCAPE, AND HABITAT-QUALITY METRICS ACROSS 37 ISLANDS AND 3 CONTINUOUS FOREST SITES THROUGHOUT THE BALBINA ARCHIPELAGO. WE CONDUCTED 1168 KM OF DIURNAL CENSUSES AND HAD 12,420 CAMERA-TRAPPING DAYS ALONG 81 TRANSECTS WITH 207 CAMERA STATIONS. WE DETERMINED THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS (OR GROUPS) DETECTED PER 10 KM WALKED AND THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT PHOTOGRAPHS PER 10 CAMERA-TRAPPING DAYS, RESPECTIVELY, FOR EACH SPECIES. WE RECORDED 34 SPECIES, AND PATCH AREA WAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF VERTEBRATE POPULATION RELATIVE ABUNDANCE AND AGGREGATE BIOMASS. THE MAXIMUM GROUP SIZE OF SEVERAL GROUP-LIVING SPECIES WAS CONSISTENTLY LARGER ON LARGE ISLANDS AND IN CONTINUOUS PATCHES THAN ON SMALL ISLANDS. MOST VERTEBRATE POPULATIONS WERE EXTIRPATED AFTER INUNDATION. REMAINING POPULATIONS ARE UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE FURTHER ECOLOGICAL DISRUPTIONS. IF ALL VERTEBRATE SPECIES WERE ONCE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED BEFORE INUNDATION, WE ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 75% OF ALL INDIVIDUAL VERTEBRATES WERE LOST FROM ALL 3546 ISLANDS AND 7.4% OF THE ANIMALS IN ALL PERSISTING INSULAR POPULATIONS ARE HIGHLY LIKELY TO BE EXTIRPATED. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT POPULATION ABUNDANCE ESTIMATES SHOULD BE FACTORED INTO PREDICTIONS OF COMMUNITY DISASSEMBLY ON SMALL ISLANDS TO ROBUSTLY PREDICT BIODIVERSITY OUTCOMES. GIVEN THE RAPIDLY ESCALATING HYDROPOWER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN DEVELOPING COUNTIES, WE SUGGEST THAT FAUNAL ABUNDANCE AND BIOMASS ESTIMATES BE CONSIDERED IN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS AND LARGE STRICTLY PROTECTED RESERVES BE ESTABLISHED TO MINIMIZE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF DAMS ON BIODIVERSITY.

IN THIS STUDY, WE TESTED THE FOLLOWING HYPOTHESES: 1) HERDING ELICITS HABITUATION TO HUMANS IN WHITE RHINO, AND 2) THIS PRACTICE AFFECTS THE BEHAVIOR AND PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE OF RHINO, BUT THEY CAN HABITUATE TO IT. TO THAT AIM, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF HERDING ON THE RESPONSE OF RHINO TO INITIALLY UNFAMILIAR PEOPLE, EXPRESSION OF AGGRESSIVE AND DISCOMFORT BEHAVIORS, AND FECAL GLUCOCORTICOID METABOLITE (FGCM) CONCENTRATIONS (A COMMONLY USED INDICATOR OF PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS) IN TWO COHORTS OF SIX AND 10 SEMI-WILD ORPHAN WHITE RHINO. RHINO DID NOT INTERRUPT THEIR ACTIVITY TO AN APPROACHING PERSON ON FOOT (99%) OR IN A VEHICLE (94%), INDICATING HABITUATION TO HUMANS. AGGRESSIVE AND DISCOMFORT BEHAVIORS WERE DISPLAYED MORE OFTEN WHILE BEING HERDED, AND THEIR FREQUENCY INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH INCREASING HERDING PRESSURE. FINALLY, OVERALL MEAN FGCM CONCENTRATIONS WERE 16.1% HIGHER UNDER HERDING COMPARED TO NON-HERDING CONDITIONS, BUT INDIVIDUAL FGCM LEVELS VARIED UP TO 17-FOLD UNDER EACH SCENARIO, SUGGESTING THAT HERDING MIGHT NOT ELICIT A PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS RESPONSE IN THESE ANIMALS. WHILE RHINO SECURITY IS PARAMOUNT IN THE CURRENT POACHING CRISIS, MANAGEMENT PRACTICES MUST ENSURE THAT THEY DO NOT IMPACT NEGATIVELY AT THE INDIVIDUAL AND POPULATION LEVEL. © 2020 THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON",NA,NA,NA,"FÀBREGAS, M.C.; DEPARTMENT OF PARACLINICAL SCIENCES, SOUTH AFRICA; EMAIL: MARIA.FABREGAS@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1111/acv.12646,"NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATIONNATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION, NRF UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIAUNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA, UP",13679430,ANIMAL CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,1,3,412-423,JOHN WILEY AND SONS INC,NA,SCOPUS,UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES OF CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT PRACTICES: CASE STUDY ON HERDING RHINO AS AN ANTI-POACHING MEASURE,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092167809&doi=10.1111%2facv.12646&partnerID=40&md5=a16c8f39b65f484a6dbe4b3d0c4a530f,24,2021,"WE THANK THE UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA AND THE NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF SOUTH AFRICA (NRF) FOR FUNDING THE LEAD AUTHOR IN CONDUCTING THIS STUDY.

MOST HABITAT PATCHES OF ATLANTIC FOREST ARE DISPERSED ACROSS AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES (E.G., GRAZING AND CROPPING) IN RELATIVELY SMALL AND ISOLATED FRAGMENTS (80% < 50 HA). FOREST FRAGMENTS < 1 HA, SCATTERED TREES IN PASTURES, TREE LINES ON TRENCHES AND FENCES, AND REMNANT RIPARIAN FOREST, COLLECTIVELY CALLED HERE SMALL LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS (SLES), ARE VERY COMMON IN THIS CONTEXT. WHILE THESE SLES MAKE UP MUCH OF THE ATLANTIC FORESTS FOOTPRINT, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR ROLE OR IMPACT ON THE PERSISTENCE AND CONSERVATION OF SPECIES. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF SLES ON LANDSCAPE CONFIGURATION, PARTICULARLY THEIR CONTRIBUTION TOWARD LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES AND THE GENETIC FLOW OF SPECIES BETWEEN LARGER FOREST FRAGMENTS. WE RANDOMLY SELECTED 20 BUFFERS OF 707 HECTARES WITHIN A 411,670 HECTARE AREA OF THE ATLANTIC FOREST THAT WAS COMPLETELY COVERED BY FOREST IN THE PAST LOCATED IN THE SOUTH OF MINAS GERAIS STATE, BRAZIL. THE FOREST COVER RANDOMLY VARIED BETWEEN THESE BUFFERS. WE USED GRAPH THEORY TO MEASURE LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY AS THE PROBABILITY OF CONNECTIVITY FOR DIFFERENT DISPERSER MOVEMENT TYPES BETWEEN LANDSCAPE KNOTS (HABITAT PATCHES). WE USED THREE ESTIMATED DISPERSAL DISTANCES IN THE MODELS: POLLEN DISPERSER INSECT (50 M), LOW-MOBILITY SEED DISPERSER BIRD (100 M) AND HIGH-MOBILITY SEED DISPERSER BIRD (760 M). THE SLES TOGETHER INCREASED THE PROBABILITY OF CONNECTION BY ROUGHLY 50%, FOR ALL MODEL DISPERSERS, IF COMPARED TO A THEORETICAL BASELINE LANDSCAPE CONTAINING NO SLES. OF ALL SLES, RIPARIAN FORESTS CONTRIBUTE THE MOST TOWARD ENHANCING LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY. IN THESE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPES, SUCH AS THE ATLANTIC FOREST (>70%), THE POSITION OF SLES WITHIN THE LANDSCAPES WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS FOR CONNECTIVITY. ALTHOUGH THE LANDSCAPES WERE DEEPLY FRAGMENTED, WE SHOWED THAT THE PRESENCE OF SLES CAN INCREASE CONNECTIVITY AND REDUCE FURTHER BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST. © COPYRIGHT © 2021 SIQUEIRA, DE CARVALHO, RHODES, ARCHIBALD, REZENDE AND VAN DEN BERG.",614362,NA,NA,"SIQUEIRA, F.F.; FORESTRY DEPARTMENT, BRAZIL; EMAIL: FLAVIAFREIRELV@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.3389/fevo.2021.614362,"COORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIORCOORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIOR, CAPES CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICO, CNPQ FUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE MINAS GERAISFUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE MINAS GERAIS, FAPEMIG",2296701X,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,7,NA,NA,FRONTIERS MEDIA S.A.,NA,SCOPUS,SMALL LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS DOUBLE CONNECTIVITY IN HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AREAS OF THE BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107453374&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2021.614362&partnerID=40&md5=3a0d406607c9d1ef9b88b49b63267139,9,2021,"WE THANK MANOEL SIQUEIRA, ANGELIM TUCUNDUVA, GABRIEL CARAMASCHI, PAULA COELHO, GABRIELA CARLOS, SARA BASTOS, MATEUS CARDOSO, AND DANIELA DOMINGOS, FOR THE HELP WITH THE FIELDWORK.

SUCH METHODS CONSIST OF QUANTIFYING INPUT AND OUTPUT FLOWS TO ASSESS THEIR SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO IMPACT CATEGORIES. THEREFORE, LAND OCCUPATION AND TRANSFORMATION ARE CONSIDERED AS INPUTS TO ASSESS BIODIVERSITY IMPACTS AMONGST OTHERS. HOWEVER, THE MODELLING OF BIODIVERSITY IMPACT IN DEEP SEAFLOOR ECOSYSTEMS IS STILL LACKING IN LCA. MOST OF THE LCA METHODS FOCUS ON TERRESTRIAL BIODIVERSITY AND NONE OF THEM CAN BE TRANSPOSED TO BENTHIC DEEP SEA BECAUSE OF KNOWLEDGE GAPS. THIS MANUSCRIPT PROPOSES A LCA FRAMEWORK TO ASSESS BIODIVERSITY IMPACTS IN DEEP SEAFLOOR ECOSYSTEMS. THE FRAMEWORK BUILDS UPON THE EXISTING METHODS ACCOUNTING FOR BIODIVERSITY IMPACTS IN TERRESTRIAL AND COASTAL HABITATS. A TWO-STEP APPROACH IS PROPOSED, ASSESSING IMPACTS ON REGIONAL AND ON GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY. WHILE THE EVALUATION OF REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY IMPACTS RELIES ONLY ON THE BENTHIC COMMUNITIES' RESPONSE TO DISTURBANCE, THE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE CONSIDERS ECOSYSTEM VULNERABILITY AND SCARCITY. THOSE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVE FOR THE COMPARISON OF IMPACTS OCCURRING IN DIFFERENT ECOSYSTEMS.

AMAZON FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS ARE LARGELY UNPROTECTED BECAUSE A TERRESTRIAL BIAS HAS LIMITED THE ABILITY OF SCIENCE TO AFFECT POLICY. OVERCOMING THIS BIAS REQUIRES INCREASING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AMONG STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE BASIN TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THREATS TO AMAZON FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS AND PROMOTE DISCUSSIONS AND ACCESS TO CONSERVATION SOLUTIONS. TO HELP ADDRESS THIS NEED, THIS SPECIAL ISSUE COLLATES 15 SYNTHETIC ARTICLES THAT ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE AND IDENTIFY CONSERVATION SOLUTIONS. THREE ARTICLES HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING THE HYDROLOGICAL AND LIMNOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT CONTROL THE INTEGRITY OF THESE FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS AND OFFER NEW INSIGHTS ON HOW TO EXTRAPOLATE THEM ACROSS THE BASIN. THREE ARTICLES ON CROCODILIANS, AQUATIC MAMMALS, AND MIGRATORY FISHES DOCUMENT THREATS AND KNOWLEDGE GAPS, AND IDENTIFY THE MISSING ROLE OF GOVERNMENTS AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO CONSERVATION OF THEIR POPULATIONS. THREE ARTICLES EVALUATE THE MULTI-FACETED EFFECTS OF HYDROPOWER DAMS ON FISH, BIRDS, AND FLOODPLAIN TREES. THEY REINFORCE PERCEPTIONS THAT DAMS ARE KEY ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS AND OFFER GUIDANCE FOR IMPROVING PROTOCOLS FOR DAM SITE SELECTION AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT. THREE ARTICLES ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROTECTED AREAS TO SAFEGUARD FISH AND AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES SHOW THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO REDESIGN THE AMAZON PROTECTED AREA NETWORK TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT FRESHWATER BIOTA. THREE FORWARD-LOOKING ARTICLES SHOW THAT: (I) CONSERVATION INITIATIVES BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE ‘BRIGHT SPOTS’ FOR FRESHWATER CONSERVATION; (II) MICROCHEMISTRY ANALYSES OF THE EAR BONES OF FISHES COULD BOOST THE KNOWLEDGE BASE NEEDED TO CONSERVE THEM; AND (III) STRENGTHENING THE AMAZON CONSERVATION FRAMEWORK REQUIRES A REVERSAL OF BRAZIL'S CURRENT GOVERNMENTAL PRIORITIES, REMOBILIZATION OF STAKEHOLDERS, INVESTMENTS IN CAPACITY BUILDING, AND EXPANDING PROTECTIONS TO TERRESTRIAL AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS. © 2021 JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD.",NA,NA,AQCOE,"CASTELLO, L.; DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: LEANDRO@VT.EDU",ARTICLE,10.1002/aqc.3615,NA,10527613,AQUATIC CONSERVATION: MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,ENGLISH,NA,NA,5,5,999-1004,JOHN WILEY AND SONS LTD,NA,SCOPUS,SCIENCE FOR CONSERVING AMAZON FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105465222&doi=10.1002%2faqc.3615&partnerID=40&md5=ad01a1abcb5775168cb73d5d2444a20b,31,2021,NA NA NA,AQUATIC CONSERV MAR FRESHW ECOSYST,none,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND STATE UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED,NA,"CASTELLO L, 2021, AQUATIC CONSERV MAR FRESHW ECOSYST","CASTELLO L, 2021, AQUATIC CONSERV MAR FRESHW ECOSYST"

UNFORTUNATELY, WITH INCREASING CASES OF FAILURE, THE LINK BETWEEN POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND CONSERVATION IS NOW CONTROVERSIAL. WE REVISITED THE EARLIEST ICDP PROJECT IN CHINA AFTER 12 YEARS. THE PROJECT AREA EXPERIENCED INCREASING FREE-RANGING LIVESTOCK AFTER 2004, WHICH DEGRADED THE PANDA HABITAT. WE COLLECTED LIVESTOCK AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DATA USING CONSTRUCTED HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS AND APPLIED LOGIT AND ZERO-TRUNCATED POISSON MODELS TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF ICDP. ABOUT 76% OF LIVESTOCK ACTIVITIES WERE IN THE PANDA HABITAT. RECEIPT OF ICDP FUNDS INCREASED THE CHANCE OF A HOUSEHOLD TO BECOME A LIVESTOCK OWNER. THE PARTICIPATION IN ICDP ALSO INCREASED THE NUMBERS OF BOTH THE TRADITIONAL LIVESTOCK — CATTLE BY 83% — AS WELL AS THE EMERGING TYPE HORSES BY 203%. HORSES WERE ENCOURAGED FOR TOURISM AND LATER RAISED FOR MEAT PRODUCTION. THE INCOME FROM ALTERNATIVE LIVELIHOODS SUCH AS TOURISM AND OFF-FARM JOBS REDUCED THE RELIANCE ON CATTLE BUT ENCOURAGED HAVING MORE HORSES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT WITH THE BAN ON LOGGING AND REDUCED CROPLAND, ASSISTANCE FROM ICDP FACILITATED THE PARTICIPANTS TO ACCUMULATE WEALTH MUCH QUICKER THAN OTHERS AND TO INCREASE THEIR LIVESTOCK HOLDINGS. THE IMMEDIATE SUCCESS IN REDUCING RELIANCE ON CERTAIN NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OF THE SHORT-DURATION PROJECTS COULD FAIL THE LONG-TERM GOALS OF CONSERVING THE ENDANGERED SPECIES HABITAT.

WE INVENTORIED 89 CREATED WETLANDS (0.2–20 HA) IN CENTRAL SWEDEN TO INVESTIGATE WHICH LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE COMPONENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH BREEDING WETLAND BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS, PAIR ABUNDANCE AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS.

IN RESPONSE, THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REINTRODUCTIONS OF SPECIES TO THEIR HISTORICAL RANGES. PREDATION BY NATIVE AND EXOTIC PREDATORS, HOWEVER, REMAINS A BARRIER TO SUCCESS. OVER THE PAST 200 YEARS, AUSTRALIA HAS SEEN THE HIGHEST RATE OF MAMMAL EXTINCTION ON EARTH, WITH MAMMALS WITHIN A CRITICAL WEIGHT RANGE (CWR: 35 G–5.5 KG) MOST AFFECTED DUE TO PREDATION BY EXOTIC PREDATORS. POPULATIONS OF SOME THREATENED SPECIES NOW EXIST ONLY IN TASMANIA, OFFSHORE ISLANDS, OR PREDATOR-PROOF SANCTUARIES. THE NEXT CRITICAL STEP IS TO RETURN NATIVE POPULATIONS OUTSIDE OF PREDATOR-FREE AREAS, ‘BEYOND-THE-FENCE’, ON THE CONTINENTAL MAINLAND. GIVEN OUR CURRENT INABILITY TO COMPLETELY REMOVE EXOTIC PREDATORS FROM MAINLAND ECOSYSTEMS, HOW CAN WE ACHIEVE SUCCESSFUL MAMMAL REINTRODUCTIONS? A POTENTIAL SOLUTION IS TO DRIVE ADAPTATION OF REINTRODUCED ANIMALS TOWARDS PREDATOR-RESISTANCE BY EXPOSING THEM TO LOW LEVELS OF PREDATION. WE PROPOSE THE CONCEPT OF A ‘GOLDILOCKS ZONE’—THE ‘JUST RIGHT’ LEVELS OF PREDATION NEEDED TO DRIVE SELECTION FOR PREDATOR-RESISTANT NATIVE SPECIES, WHILE ENSURING POPULATION VIABILITY. WE EXPERIMENTALLY REINTRODUCED A MAMMAL, THE EASTERN BETTONG (BETTONGIA GAIMARDI), TO MAINLAND AUSTRALIA, 100 YEARS AFTER ITS LOCAL EXTINCTION. USING AN INTENSE BAITING REGIME, WE REDUCED THE POPULATION DENSITY OF THE RED FOX (VULPES VULPES), THE MAIN FACTOR BEHIND THE EASTERN BETTONG’S EXTIRPATION FROM THE CONTINENT. REDUCING BAIT TAKE TO 15% OF PREVIOUS LEVELS ALLOWED DIFFERENTIAL SURVIVAL AMONG BETTONGS; SOME SURVIVING UNDER 100 DAYS AND OTHERS OVER 450 (~ 4 TIMES LONGER THAN SOME SIMILAR TRIALS WITH RELATED SPECIES). SURVIVING INDIVIDUALS WERE GENERALLY LARGER AT RELEASE THAN THOSE THAT DIED EARLIER, IMPLYING SELECTION FOR LARGER BETTONGS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT REDUCING PREDATION COULD ESTABLISH A GOLDILOCKS ZONE THAT COULD DRIVE SELECTION FOR BETTONGS WITH PREDATOR-RESISTANT TRAITS.

OBJECTIVES: WE USED A ROBUST DATASET OF MEDIUM AND LARGE-SIZED MAMMALS TO TEST (A) THE HABITAT AMOUNT HYPOTHESIS, WHICH POSTULATES THAT SPECIES RICHNESS CAN BE MAINLY PREDICTED BY THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF HABITAT SURROUNDING THE SAMPLING SITE, AND (B) THE EFFECTS OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION PER SE, WHICH MAY BE EXPECTED TO BE WEAK OR MAINLY POSITIVE ON SPECIES RICHNESS. METHODS: WE COMPILED INFORMATION ON THE OCCURRENCE OF MAMMAL SPECIES IN 166 FOREST FRAGMENTS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC FOREST. FOR EACH FOREST FRAGMENT, WE EXTRACTED INFORMATION ON PATCH SIZE, PERCENTAGE OF FOREST COVER (A PROXY FOR HABITAT AMOUNT), AND EDGE DENSITY AND NUMBER OF FRAGMENTS (FRAGMENTATION METRICS). WE RELATED THESE METRICS TO MAMMALIAN RICHNESS CONSIDERING SEPARATELY FOR ALL SPECIES, FOREST-DEPENDENT SPECIES, DISTURBANCE-TOLERANT SPECIES, AND DIFFERENT TROPHIC GUILDS. RESULTS: ALL RICHNESS MEASURES STRONGLY DECLINED WITH DECREASING FOREST COVER, YET WERE UNAFFECTED BY PATCH SIZE, NUMBER OF PATCHES AND EDGE DENSITY. THE ONLY EXCEPTION OCCURRED WITH HERBIVORE RICHNESS, WHICH WAS AFFECTED BY NUMBER OF PATCHES. HOWEVER, WE FOUND FRAGMENTATION PER SE EFFECTS ONLY FOR HERBIVORE RICHNESS. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT MAMMAL RICHNESS INCREASED WITH HABITAT AMOUNT AT THE LANDSCAPE, WHEREAS HABITAT FRAGMENTATION PER SE HAD SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON HERBIVORES ONLY.

BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND ECOSYSTEM DEGRADATION WORLDWIDE REQUIRE THE FORMATION OF NEW CONCEPTS OF ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION AND REHABILITATION AIMED AT IMPROVING ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS, SERVICES, AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN CITIES. ALTHOUGH RELICT SITES OF NATURAL AND SEMI-NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS CAN BE FOUND IN URBAN AREAS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND SPECIES COMPOSITION OF MOST URBAN ECOSYSTEMS ARE HIGHLY MODIFIED, INDUCING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL AND HYBRID ECOSYSTEMS. A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ECOLOGICAL NOVELTY IS THE LACK OF (SEMI-) NATURAL REFERENCE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE FOR DEFINING RESTORATION TARGETS AND ASSESSING RESTORATION SUCCESS IN URBAN AREAS. THIS HAMPERS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION IN CITIES. IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE CHALLENGES, WE PRESENT A NEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK THAT PROVIDES GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT FOR URBAN ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION AND REHABILITATION BY FORMULATING RESTORATION TARGETS FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ECOLOGICAL NOVELTY (I.E., HISTORIC, HYBRID, AND NOVEL ECOSYSTEMS). TO FACILITATE THE RESTORATION AND REHABILITATION OF NOVEL URBAN ECOSYSTEMS, WE RECOMMEND USING ESTABLISHED SPECIES-RICH AND WELL-FUNCTIONING URBAN ECOSYSTEMS AS REFERENCE. SUCH URBAN REFERENCE SYSTEMS ARE LIKELY TO BE PRESENT IN MANY CITIES. HIGHLIGHTING THEIR VALUE IN COMPARISON TO DEGRADED ECOSYSTEMS CAN STIMULATE AND GUIDE RESTORATION INITIATIVES. AS URBAN RESTORATION APPROACHES MUST CONSIDER LOCAL HISTORY AND SITE CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS CITIZENS’ NEEDS, IT MAY ALSO BE ADVISABLE TO FOCUS THE RESTORATION OF STRONGLY ALTERED URBAN ECOSYSTEMS ON SELECTED ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS, SERVICES AND/OR BIODIVERSITY VALUES.

BATS ARE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ARE USEFUL BIO-INDICATORS OF HABITAT DISTURBANCE, YET THE RESPONSE AND VULNERABILITY OF BATS TO FRAGMENTATION HAVE BEEN POORLY STUDIED IN AFRICA. WE AIM TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF FOREST BIOGEOGRAPHICAL HISTORY AND FRAGMENTATION ON FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF BATS AND THEIR FUNCTIONAL TRAITS. LOCATION: EASTERN CAPE AND SOUTHERN KWAZULU-NATAL, SOUTH AFRICA. TAXON: INSECTIVOROUS BATS. METHODS: WE SURVEYED FOREST-UTILIZING BATS TO DERIVE FOUR FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY INDICES. GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS WERE USED TO ASSESS THE RESPONSE OF DIVERSITY INDICES TO BIOGEOGRAPHICAL HISTORY AND FRAGMENTATION, REPRESENTED BY FOREST TYPE AND FIVE LANDSCAPE FRAGMENTATION METRICS. RLQ AND FOURTH-CORNER ANALYSIS WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE INTERACTION OF TRAITS WITH FRAGMENTATION METRICS AND FOREST TYPE. RESULTS: PONDOLAND SCARP FORESTS DISPLAYED HIGH FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS, WHILE EASTERN CAPE DUNE FORESTS EXHIBITED HIGH FUNCTIONAL DIVERGENCE YET LOW FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS AND DISPERSION. TWO FRAGMENTATION METRICS AFFECTED FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY DYNAMICALLY: EDGE DENSITY HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON FUNCTIONAL EVENNESS; AND DISPERSION WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY RIVER LENGTH THROUGH FORESTS. RESULTS SHOWED STRONGER INTERACTIONS OF FUNCTIONAL TRAITS WITH FOREST TYPE THAN FRAGMENTATION METRICS, WITH FILTERING EFFECTS ON BODY SIZE AND WING MORPHOLOGY. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: THE LARGE-SCALE PROCESSES RELATED TO BIOGEOGRAPHICAL HISTORY, AND ASSOCIATED FOREST STRUCTURE, ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS, DIVERGENCE AND DISPERSION OF INSECTIVOROUS BAT COMMUNITIES. SCARP FORESTS SHOWED THE HIGHEST SPECIES AND FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS AS THEY EXPERIENCED LESS EXTREME CLIMATIC EXTINCTION FILTERING THAN MISTBELT FORESTS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM, WHEREAS THE LOW DIVERSITY OF EASTERN CAPE DUNE FORESTS RESULTS FROM THEIR YOUNGER EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY AND HOMOGENOUS VEGETATION STRUCTURE.

AMPHIBIANS ARE DECLINING WORLDWIDE, AND THE LOSS OF HABITAT AND WATER CONTAMINATION RELATED TO AGRICULTURAL LAND USES HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED AS THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THIS PHENOMENON. IN CENTRAL ARGENTINA, THE PAMPEAN REGION COMBINES THE HIGHEST RATES OF GRASSLAND REPLACEMENT OF SOUTH AMERICA, THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE OF PROTECTED AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, AND THE LACK OF STUDIES EXPLORING DIVERSITY PATTERNS OF NATIVE AMPHIBIANS OCCURRING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS. TO FILL THESE GAPS, WE SURVEYED ANURAN (FROGS AND TOADS) ASSEMBLAGES FROM 342 BREEDING PONDS LOCATED IN THREE ECOLOGICAL UNITS FROM CENTRAL ARGENTINA (ROLLING, FLOODING, AND INLAND PAMPAS) DURING THREE BREEDING SEASONS (2015–2018). WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE IMPORTANCE OF BREEDING HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS (PONDS) AND THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE FEATURES AS DRIVERS OF ANURAN DIVERSITY OCCURRING IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES UNDER THE PRIMARY LAND USES OF THE REGION (CATTLE GRAZING AND SOYBEAN CROPPING). WE TESTED FOR THE EFFECTS OF BREEDING HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS AND LANDSCAPE FEATURES ON ANURAN RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE, AND INDIVIDUAL SPECIES OCCURRENCE, USING GLMM MODELS AND INFORMATION-THEORETIC PROCEDURES. RESULTS INDICATED THAT SPECIES RICHNESS AND TOTAL ABUNDANCES WERE DIFFERENTLY INFLUENCED BY THE HABITAT AND LANDSCAPE FEATURES ACROSS THE ECOLOGICAL UNITS. OVERALL, VEGETATION COVER OF THE PONDS AND LAND USE WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES INFLUENCING RICHNESS AND ANURAN ABUNDANCE. THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF POND VEGETATION COVER ON ANURAN ASSEMBLAGES WAS REGISTERED FOR ALL THE ECOLOGICAL UNITS, WHILE DIFFERENT PATTERNS EMERGED WHEN WE ANALYZED THE EFFECTS OF LAND USE SURROUNDING THE PONDS. LAND USE EXPRESSED AS THE PERCENTAGE OF SOY CROP SURROUNDING THE PONDS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF ANURANS OF THE FLOODING PAMPAS, BUT THE INVERSE RELATION WAS FOUND FOR ASSEMBLAGES OCCURRING IN THE INLAND PAMPAS. MOREOVER, MULTIPLE COMPETING MODELS SUGGESTED A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN ANURAN DIVERSITY AND LAND-USE HETEROGENEITY, AND POND DENSITY. THE DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES OF ANURAN ASSEMBLAGES AMONG THE ECOLOGICAL UNITS CAN BE RELATED TO A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL FACTORS ENCOMPASSING REGIONAL SOIL CHARACTERISTICS (I.E., SOIL TEXTURE), LAND-USE INTENSITY AS WELL AS REQUIREMENTS OF ANURAN SPECIES. WE DISCUSSED THE PARTICULARITIES OF EACH ECOLOGICAL UNIT IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE THOSE CONSERVATION EFFORTS THAT WILL FAVOR ANURAN DIVERSITY IN THESE ALTERED LANDSCAPES AND FURTHER CONTRIBUTE TO ACHIEVING AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY. © 2021 ELSEVIER B.V.",107323,NA,AEEND,"AGOSTINI, G.; CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, PABELLÓN II.

WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SUDDEN POLICY-INDUCED LOSS OF WILD MEAT FROM FOOD SYSTEMS COULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE AND NATURE. LOSS OF WILD MEAT FROM DIETS COULD LEAD TO FOOD INSECURITY, DUE TO REDUCED PROTEIN AND NUTRITION, AND/OR DRIVE LAND-USE CHANGE TO REPLACE LOST NUTRIENTS WITH ANIMAL AGRICULTURE, WHICH COULD INCREASE BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASE RISK.

CRYOPRESERVATION OF AVIAN EGGS AND EMBRYOS IS IMPRACTICABLE, AND CURRENTLY ONLY FROZEN PGCS ENABLE CONSERVATION OF BOTH THE MALE AND FEMALE DESCENDANTS. PUREBRED OFFSPRING HAVE BEEN OBTAINED FROM GERMLINE CHIMERAS OF WILD AVIAN SPECIES, PROVING THE FEASIBILITY OF SUCH TECHNOLOGY. IN VITRO PROPAGATION HAS BEEN OPTIMIZED FOR AVIAN PGCS OF DOMESTIC SPECIES; HOWEVER, EVIDENCE IS RATHER LIMITED FOR SUCCESSFUL ISOLATION AS WELL AS LONG-TERM CULTURE FROM A SINGLE EMBRYO OF WILD SPECIES. WITH ACCELERATING BIODIVERSITY LOSS, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO PRESERVING CURRENT GENETIC RESOURCES BY FREEZING PGCS ISOLATED FROM INDIVIDUAL EMBRYOS IN ADDITION TO THEIR GENETIC MATERIAL. WE HAVE DEVISED A RELIABLE PROTOCOL FOR THE ISOLATION AND PROLIFERATION OF PGCS FROM WILD FOWLS IN THE FAMILY PHASIANIDAE THAT ARE CONSERVED IN CAPTIVE BREEDING (RED JUNGLEFOWL, BAR-TAILED PHEASANT, KALIJ PHEASANT, SIAMESE FIREBACK PHEASANT, AND SILVER PHEASANT). WE OBTAINED INDIVIDUAL ISOLATES OF CULTURED CIRCULATING PGCS (49.7%, 79/155) AS WELL AS TISSUE PGCS (92.9%, 144/155). THE SPECIFIC CO-CULTURE CONDITIONS OF AUTOLOGOUS EMBRYONIC CELLS, WITHOUT ADDITIONAL GROWTH FACTORS, FACILITATED THE PROLIFERATION OF SO-CALLED TISSUE PGCS (THE REMAINING PGCS IN EMBRYONIC TISSUE FOLLOWING BLOOD ASPIRATION). ONLY CIRCULATING PGCS LEFT IN BLOOD VESSELS AND OF PGCS MIGRATING TO DEVELOPING GONADS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED. HOWEVER, THE PRESENT STUDY IS THE FIRST TO REPORT ON THE HARVEST OF ECTOPIC PGCS. THE DEFINED CONDITIONS SUSTAINED CONTINUOUS PROLIFERATION OF TISSUE PGCS FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS AND MAINTAINED PGC IDENTITY FOLLOWING CRYOPRESERVATION. CULTURED TISSUE PGCS OF THESE WILD SPECIES WERE EXTENSIVELY CHARACTERIZED FOR THEIR EXPRESSION OF THE GERM CELL-SPECIFIC PROTEINS, CHICKEN VASA HOMOLOG (CVH) AND DELETED IN AZOOSPERMIA-LIKE (DAZL), AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO COLONIZE CHICKEN EMBRYONIC GONADS. THE NOVEL PROTOCOL IS PRACTICAL FOR GENERATING ENOUGH PGCS FOR CRYOPRESERVATION, TRANSPLANTATION, AND ADDITIONALLY, IT ENABLES ISOLATION OF PGCS FROM BOTH BLOOD CIRCULATION AND EMBRYONIC TISSUE SIMULTANEOUSLY.

A KEY QUESTION IS HOW TO RECONCILE THESE POTENTIALLY COMPETING GOALS SPATIALLY. WE USE INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING TO DEVELOP AN ‘INTEGRATED LAND USE PLANNING FRAMEWORK’ THAT IDENTIFIES THE OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF 17 CROPS UNDER DIFFERENT HYPOTHETICAL CONSERVATION TARGETS WHILE MEETING AGRICULTURAL DEMANDS BY 2030. INTENSIFYING EXISTING CROPLAND TO MAXIMUM YIELD BEFORE ALLOCATING NEW CROPLAND WOULD REDUCE LAND REQUIREMENT BY 43% VERSUS CROPLAND EXPANSION WITHOUT INTENSIFICATION. EVEN WITH YIELD GAP CLOSURE, TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICAL CROPS STILL REQUIRE EXPANSION, PRIMARILY ALLOCATED TO VENEZUELA, EASTERN BRAZIL, CONGO BASIN, MYANMAR AND INDONESIA. ENFORCEMENT OF PROTECTED AREAS, VIA AVOIDING CONVERSION IN 75% OF KEY BIODIVERSITY AREAS AND 65% OF INTACT AREAS, IS VITAL TO ATTAIN BIODIVERSITY TARGETS BUT BEARS LARGE OPPORTUNITY COSTS, WITH AGRICULTURAL RENTS DROPPING FROM $4.1 TO $2.8 TRILLION. ALTHOUGH NATIONALLY CONSTRAINED FOREST CONSERVATION EFFORTS WOULD EARN 9% LESS AGRICULTURAL RENTS COMPARED TO GLOBALLY COORDINATED CONSERVATION SOLUTIONS, THEY WERE ALSO ABLE TO REDUCE INTACT HABITAT AND FOREST LOSS (43% AND 35% REDUCTION). OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT CAREFUL CHOICE OF THE ALLOCATION OF FUTURE CROPLAND EXPANSION, COULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE—BUT NOT ELIMINATE—THE TRADEOFFS BETWEEN THE SDGS FOR FOOD PRODUCTION AND LAND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. © 2021 ELSEVIER LTD",112032,NA,JEVMA,"ZHANG, Y.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 14 SCIENCE DRIVE 4, SINGAPORE; EMAIL: DBSZYUC@NUS.EDU.SG",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112032,"CHICKEN FARMERS OF SASKATCHEWANCHICKEN FARMERS OF SASKATCHEWAN, CFS, C-141-000-777-532, C-154-000-207-532, R-154-000-B44-114, R-154-000-C09-114",3014797,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,ACADEMIC PRESS,33545453,SCOPUS,COORDINATED INTENSIFICATION TO RECONCILE THE ‘ZERO HUNGER’ AND ‘LIFE ON LAND’ SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100382928&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2021.112032&partnerID=40&md5=8dbef4dd06353f4e298219ade82fbb13,284,2021,THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE RESEARCH SCHOLARSHIP BLOCK (RSB) AND THE SINGAPORE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION CO-FUNDING SCHEME (CFS) [GRANT NUMBERS R-154-000-C09-114 ; C-154-000-207-532 ; C-141-000-777-532 ; R-154-000-B44-114 ].

ROBUST ASSESSMENTS OF FOREST CONDITION ARE CRITICAL FOR SUCCESSFUL FOREST MANAGEMENT, BUT MANY EXISTING TECHNIQUES ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL, TIME-CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE OR REQUIRE SPECIALIST KNOWLEDGE. TO MAKE ASSESSMENT OF TROPICAL FORESTS ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF ACTORS, MANY OF WHOM MAY BE LIMITED BY RESOURCES OR EXPERTISE, THE HIGH CONSERVATION VALUE RESOURCE NETWORK (HCVRN), WITH THE SE ASIA RAINFOREST RESEARCH PARTNERSHIP (SEARRP), DEVELOPED A SOUTH EAST ASIAN VERSION OF THE FOREST INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT (FIA) TOOL AS A RAPID (< 1 HOUR) METHOD OF ASSESSING FOREST CONDITION IN THE FIELD, WHERE NON-EXPERTS RESPOND TO 50 QUESTIONS ABOUT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT WHILE WALKING A SITE TRANSECT. HERE, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS SURVEY TOOL BY CONDUCTING ∼ 1000 ASSESSMENTS OF FOREST CONDITION AT 16 TROPICAL RAINFOREST SITES WITH VARYING LEVELS OF DISTURBANCE IN SABAH, MALAYSIAN BORNEO. WE FOUND GOOD AGREEMENT (R-SQUARED RANGE: 0.50–0.78) BETWEEN FIA SURVEY SCORES AND INDEPENDENT MEASURES OF FOREST CONDITION, INCLUDING BIODIVERSITY, VEGETATION STRUCTURE, ABOVEGROUND CARBON AND OTHER KEY METRICS OF ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION, INDICATING THAT THE TOOL PERFORMED WELL. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS VARIATION AMONG ASSESSOR RESPONSES WHEN SURVEYING THE SAME FOREST SITES, ASSESSORS WERE CONSISTENT IN THEIR RANKING OF THOSE SITES, AND PRIOR FOREST KNOWLEDGE HAD A MINIMAL EFFECT ON THE FIA SCORES. REVISIONS OR FURTHER TRAINING FOR QUESTIONS WHERE ASSESSORS DISAGREE, FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE PRESENCE OF FAUNA AT A SITE, COULD IMPROVE CONSISTENCY. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE FIA SURVEY TOOL IS A ROBUST METHOD OF ASSESSING FOREST CONDITION, PROVIDING A RAPID AND ACCESSIBLE MEANS OF FOREST CONSERVATION ASSESSMENT. THE FIA TOOL COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN A WIDE RANGE OF FOREST CONSERVATION SCHEMES, FROM SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS, TO COMMUNITY FORESTRY AND RESTORATION INITIATIVES.

THIS ECOSYSTEM'S FLORAL AND FAUNAL STRUCTURE INCORPORATES 334 FLORAL, 300 BIRDS, 120 FISH, 35 REPTILES, AND 32 MAMMALS SPECIES. IT CONTRIBUTES 41% OF THE TOTAL FOREST INCOME OF BANGLADESH. THIS PAPER IS INTENDED TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANT REASONS FOR BIODIVERSITY CALAMITY AND ITS RELATED EFFECTS ON LIVES AND DEGRADATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. A TOTAL OF 105 PUBLISHED ARTICLES AND REPORTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY SEARCHING FOUR KEYWORDS: DEGRADATION, BIODIVERSITY, SUNDARBAN, AND BANGLADESH. BY CONSIDERING THE SCOPE, 28 ARTICLES AND 17 REPORTS WERE INCORPORATED TO SATISFY THE OBJECTIVES. THE STUDY REVEALED THAT THE PROMINENT CAUSES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS OF SUNDARBAN MIGHT BE DUE TO INTENSIFIED SHRIMP CULTIVATION, INCREASED DEPENDENCY ON FOREST AND ILLICIT FELLING, CHANGING LAND USE PATTERN, OIL SPILLAGE, AND POLLUTION, FOREST FIRE, IMPROPER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, PLANT DISEASES, TOURISM ACTIVITIES, UPSTREAM WITHDRAWAL OF RIVER WATER, SALINITY INTRUSION, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND SOME NATURAL CAUSES. THE IMPACTS WERE THE LOSS OF DIVERSITY OF FLORAL AND FAUNAL SPECIES SUBJECTED TO REGIONALLY EXTINCT, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, ENDANGERED, VULNERABLE, NEAR THREATENED, AND LEAST CONCERN CONDITION. OCCUPATIONAL CHANGE AND DETERIORATION OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES ARE IDENTIFIED AS IMPACTS.

TROPICAL FARM-FOREST FRONTIERS SUFFER FROM INTENSE HABITAT AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS, AND FARMERS WITH MIGRANT ORIGINS ARE IMPORTANT YET RARELY STUDIED CONSERVATION STAKEHOLDERS.

ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE OF BIRDS AND NATURE CONNECTION WERE NOT CORRELATED, AND THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY PREDICTORS IN COMMON. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT COLONIST FARMERS ARE CAPABLE OF FORMING STRONG CONNECTIONS WITH NATURE, EVEN IF THEY RARELY POSSESS DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF LOCAL FOREST BIODIVERSITY. CONSIDERING THE COMPLEX AND APPARENTLY CONTEXT-DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KNOWING AND CARING ABOUT NATURE, IT IS UNWISE TO ASSUME THAT CHANGING ONE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY AFFECT THE OTHER.

BECAUSE OF A LACK OF TEMPORAL DATA, LONG-TERM IMPACTS ARE GENERALLY INVESTIGATED LESS FREQUENTLY THAN SHORT-TERM IMPACTS. HOWEVER, THESE EFFECTS ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING BIODIVERSITY LOSS. WE DEVELOPED A BAYESIAN ISLAND BIOGEOGRAPHY MODEL COMBINING HISTORICAL IMAGERY AND CURRENT SPECIES DISTRIBUTION TO INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF URBANIZATION-INDUCED HABITAT LOSS AND ISOLATION ON BIRDS. WE SURVEYED 101 BIRD SPECIES IN 43 URBAN FOREST PATCHES IN A SOUTH AMERICAN CITY WITH DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF SIZE, ISOLATION, AND TIME SINCE THE LAST ABRUPT CHANGE IN AREA. BASED ON THE CURRENT AND HISTORICAL LANDSCAPE CONFIGURATION, WE ESTIMATED THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS BETWEEN SPECIES EXTINCTION RATE AND AREA, AND BETWEEN IMMIGRATION RATE AND ISOLATION. ADDITIONALLY, WE USED MODEL PARAMETERS TO FORECAST BIRD EXTINCTION DEBTS. LARGE PATCHES HAD LOWER EXTINCTION RATES THAN SMALL PATCHES, AND IMMIGRATION RATES WERE LOWER IN MORE ISOLATED PATCHES. FURTHERMORE, CURRENT BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS WAS BETTER EXPLAINED BY CURRENT LANDSCAPE CONFIGURATION THAN BY PAST CONFIGURATION, SUGGESTING THAT BIRDS RAPIDLY RESPOND TO CHANGES IN URBAN LANDSCAPES AND THERE ARE NO APPARENT EXTINCTION DEBTS. INDEED, WE FOUND THAT HABITAT LOSS REDUCES SPECIES DIVERSITY TO A NEW EQUILIBRIUM IN RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD (LESS THAN 10 YEARS), AND MODEL PROJECTIONS INDICATE THAT BIRD RICHNESS WILL REMAIN SIMILAR TO THE PRESENT IF PATCH AREA IS MAINTAINED. HABITAT LOSS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CAUSE OF SPECIES LOCAL EXTINCTIONS IN URBAN AREAS, AND TROPICAL CITIES COULD RAPIDLY PROMOTE BIODIVERSITY BY RESTORING FOREST COVER. © 2021 ELSEVIER LTD",109064,NA,BICOB,"DRI, G.F.; DEPARTMENT OF WILDLIFE, 5755 NUTTING HALL, ROOM 244, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: GABRIELA.FRANZOI@MAINE.EDU",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109064,"COORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIORCOORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIOR, CAPES, 1768603 CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICO, CNPQ, 309438/2016-0 FUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE GOIÁSFUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE GOIÁS, FAPEG, 201810267000023 INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE CIÊNCIA E TECNOLOGIA PARA EXCITOTOXICIDADE E NEUROPROTEÇÃOINSTITUTO NACIONAL DE CIÊNCIA E TECNOLOGIA PARA EXCITOTOXICIDADE E NEUROPROTEÇÃO, INCT-EN MINISTÉRIO DA CIÊNCIA, TECNOLOGIA, INOVAÇÕES E COMUNICAÇÕESMINISTÉRIO DA CIÊNCIA, TECNOLOGIA, INOVAÇÕES E COMUNICAÇÕES, MCTIC",63207,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,7,NA,NA,ELSEVIER LTD,NA,SCOPUS,ESTIMATING THE IMPACTS OF HABITAT LOSS INDUCED BY URBANIZATION ON BIRD LOCAL EXTINCTIONS,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103038087&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2021.109064&partnerID=40&md5=cb18b3629f865105487d4bf29fcf901c,256,2021,"WE ARE GRATEFUL TO ANDERSON SALDANHA BUENO, GERUZA LEAL MELO, AND THREE ANONYMOUS REVIEWERS FOR VALUABLE SUGGESTIONS IN THE MANUSCRIPT, AND ALSO ALLISON BREHM FOR THE ENGLISH REVIEW.

ALTHOUGH CONVENTIONAL INDICATORS FOR TARGET 1 ARE OF LOW SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL COVERAGE, CONSERVATION CULTUROMICS METRICS SHOW HOW BIODIVERSITY AWARENESS CAN BE QUANTIFIED AT THE GLOBAL SCALE. FOLLOWING METHODS USED FOR THE LIVING PLANET INDEX, WE DEVISED A SPECIES AWARENESS INDEX (SAI) TO MEASURE CHANGE IN SPECIES AWARENESS BASED ON WIKIPEDIA VIEWS. WE CALCULATED THIS INDEX AT THE PAGE LEVEL FOR 41,197 SPECIES LISTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE (IUCN) ACROSS 10 WIKIPEDIA LANGUAGES AND >2 BILLION VIEWS FROM 1 JULY 2015 TO 30 MARCH 2020. BOOTSTRAPPED INDICES FOR THE PAGE-LEVEL SAI SHOWED THAT OVERALL AWARENESS OF BIODIVERSITY INCREASED MARGINALLY OVER TIME, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE DIFFERENCES AMONG TAXONOMIC CLASSES AND LANGUAGES. AMONG TAXONOMIC CLASSES, OVERALL AWARENESS INCREASED FASTEST FOR REPTILES AND SLOWEST FOR AMPHIBIANS. AMONG LANGUAGES, OVERALL SPECIES AWARENESS INCREASED FASTEST FOR JAPANESE AND SLOWEST FOR CHINESE AND GERMAN USERS. ALTHOUGH AWARENESS OF SPECIES AS A WHOLE INCREASED AND WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOR TRADED SPECIES, FROM JANUARY 2016 THROUGH JANUARY 2020, CHANGE IN AWARENESS APPEARED NOT TO BE STRONGLY RELATED TO WHETHER THE SPECIES IS TRADED OR IS A POLLINATOR.

AS INTRODUCED, POPULATIONS INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE AND GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE, SO DOES THE POTENTIAL FOR NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON NATIVE COMMUNITIES. AS SUCH, THERE IS A NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROCESSES DRIVING RANGE EXPANSION AS SPECIES BECOME ESTABLISHED IN RECIPIENT LANDSCAPES. THROUGH AN INVESTIGATION INTO CAPACITY FOR POPULATION GROWTH AND RANGE EXPANSION OF INTRODUCED POPULATIONS OF A NON-NATIVE LIZARD (PODARCIS MURALIS), WE AIMED TO DEMONSTRATE HOW MULTI-SCALE FACTORS INFLUENCE SPATIAL SPREAD, POPULATION GROWTH, AND INVASION POTENTIAL IN INTRODUCED SPECIES. WE COLLATED LOCATION RECORDS OF P. MURALIS PRESENCE IN ENGLAND, UK THROUGH DATA COLLECTED FROM FIELD SURVEYS AND A CITIZEN SCIENCE CAMPAIGN. WE USED THESE DATA AS INPUT FOR PRESENCE-BACKGROUND MODELS TO PREDICT AREAS OF CLIMATE SUITABILITY AT A NATIONAL-SCALE (5 KM RESOLUTION), AND FINE-SCALE HABITAT SUITABILITY AT THE LOCAL SCALE (2 M RESOLUTION). WE THEN INTEGRATED LOCAL MODELS INTO AN INDIVIDUAL-BASED MODELING PLATFORM TO SIMULATE POPULATION DYNAMICS AND FORECAST RANGE EXPANSION FOR 10 POPULATIONS IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES. NATIONAL-SCALE MODELS INDICATED CLIMATE SUITABILITY HAS RESTRICTED THE SPECIES TO THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE UK, PRIMARILY BY A LATITUDINAL CLINE IN OVERWINTERING CONDITIONS. PATTERNS OF POPULATION GROWTH AND RANGE EXPANSION WERE RELATED TO DIFFERENCES IN LOCAL LANDSCAPE CONFIGURATION AND HETEROGENEITY. GROWTH CURVES SUGGEST POPULATIONS COULD BE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF EXPONENTIAL GROWTH. HOWEVER, ANNUAL RATES OF RANGE EXPANSION ARE PREDICTED TO BE LOW (5–16 M). WE CONCLUDE THAT EXTENSIVE NATIONWIDE RANGE EXPANSION THROUGH SECONDARY INTRODUCTION IS LIKELY TO BE RESTRICTED BY CURRENTLY UNSUITABLE CLIMATE BEYOND SOUTHERN REGIONS OF THE UK. HOWEVER, EXPONENTIAL GROWTH OF LOCAL POPULATIONS IN HABITATS PROVIDING TRANSPORT PATHWAYS IS LIKELY TO INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONAL EXPANSION. THE BROAD HABITAT NICHE OF P. MURALIS, COUPLED WITH CONFIGURATION OF HABITAT PATCHES IN THE LANDSCAPE, ALLOWS POPULATIONS TO INCREASE LOCALLY WITH MINIMAL DISPERSAL. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

TO MITIGATE THIS THREAT, FARMLAND HABITAT SUITABILITY SHOULD BE IMPROVED. MID-FIELD WOODLOTS SURROUNDED BY INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED FIELDS OR GRASSLANDS, REPRESENT ONE OF THE PROMISING TOOLS FOR SUCH IMPROVEMENT. HOWEVER, WOODLOTS CAN BE DOMINATED BY NON-NATIVE PLANTS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON WOODLOT FUNCTION AS REFUGEES FOR BIODIVERSITY REMAINS UNCLEAR. THEREFORE, WE STUDIED THE IMPACT OF THE INVASIVE BLACK LOCUST (ROBINIA PSEUDOACACIA L.) ON BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS IN WOODLOTS IN INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED CENTRAL EUROPEAN FARMLAND. WE SURVEYED 27 MID-FIELD WOODLOTS (13 COVERED BY NATIVE VEGETATION AND 14 DOMINATED BY BLACK LOCUST) IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, RELATING THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF ALL BIRDS, HABITAT SPECIALISTS AND HABITAT GENERALISTS TO WOODLOT CHARACTERISTICS: BLACK LOCUST OCCURRENCE, DISTANCE TO THE MAIN FOREST, AGE OF THE WOODLOT, VEGETATION STRUCTURE, ARTHROPOD BIOMASS (REPRESENTING FOOD SUPPLY FOR BIRDS), SURROUNDING HABITATS AND TYPE OF CROPS IN WHICH THEY ARE EMBEDDED. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE WOODLOTS COVERED BY THE BLACK LOCUST HAD LOWER SPECIES RICHNESS OF ALL BIRDS, HABITAT SPECIALISTS AND HABITAT GENERALISTS THAN THE WOODLOTS COVERED BY NATIVE TREE SPECIES. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE INVASIVE WOODY PLANT ON BIRDS WAS LIKELY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN VEGETATION STRUCTURE SINCE SUCH WOODLOTS HAD LOWER COVERAGE OF THE SHRUB LAYER AND LESS CONTINUOUS CANOPY. THIS MECHANISM WAS PARTICULARLY SUPPORTED IN HABITAT GENERALISTS, WHEREAS HABITAT SPECIALISTS ADDITIONALLY SHOWED POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS TO THE OTHER VEGETATION CHARACTERISTICS (NAMELY THE COVERAGE OF HERBS IN THE GROUND LAYER AND THE PROPORTION OF MEDIUM-SIZED TREES). OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT EVEN THOUGH MID-FIELD WOODLOTS HOST NUMEROUS BIRD SPECIES, THEIR ROLE IN THE DELIVERY OF CONSERVATION BENEFITS FOR BREEDING BIRDS IS COMPROMISED IF NON-NATIVE WOODY PLANTS DOMINATE THE VEGETATION.

OBJECTIVES: WE CONDUCTED THIS STUDY TO MAP SOCIOECOLOGICAL HOTSPOTS, WHERE LANDSCAPES OF SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE AND WILDLIFE HABITATS OVERLAP, SHOW TO WHAT EXTENT AND HOW THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF SOCIAL VALUES (SVS) OF PEOPLE TOWARD THEIR LANDSCAPES INTERACT WITH WILDLIFE HABITATS IN SOCIOECOLOGICAL HOTSPOTS, SIMULATE THE POTENTIAL FOR HABITAT DEGRADATION AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES LINKED TO SVS, IDENTIFY STRATEGIC AREAS FOR LANDSCAPE RESTORATION IN SOCIOECOLOGICAL HOTSPOTS, WHERE BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND SVS SUPPORT THE PERSISTENCE AND COLONIZATION OF WILDLIFE, AND DETECT SPECIFIC AREAS, WHERE SVS OF PEOPLE MAY BE CONTRADICTIVE LEADING TO LAND-USE DISPUTES. METHODS: WE DEVELOPED A MODEL TO SHOW THE POTENTIAL FOR HABITAT DEGRADATION BASED ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF SVS ASSOCIATED WITH LANDSCAPES. WE RESTRICTED OUR STUDY TO THE UPPER MISSOURI RIVER BASIN (UMRB) AND FOCUSED ON HABITATS OF FIVE KEYSTONE MAMMAL SPECIES TO ASSESS THE VALIDITY OF OUR MODEL. RESULTS: HABITAT LOSS, HABITAT SUBDIVISION, HABITAT DISPERSION, AND HABITAT SHRINKAGE CAN BE FOUR CONSEQUENCES OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES FOR BIODIVERSITY IN SOCIOECOLOGICAL HOTSPOTS OF THE UMRB, HOWEVER, THE MAGNITUDE OF IMPACTS VARIES AMONG LANDSCAPES AND MAMMAL SPECIES. CONCLUSION: SPATIALLY EXPLICIT MODELS TO PROPERLY MAP SVS IN RELATION TO WILDLIFE HABITATS ARE STILL ASSOCIATED WITH SOME UNCERTAINTIES AND LIMITATIONS, AND THEREFORE, REQUIRE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.

WE ASSESSED PLANT COMMUNITY PROPERTIES YEARLY FROM 2009 TO 2013, AND EXAMINED TREATMENT EFFECTS ON PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN THE TWO GRASSLAND TYPES. IN THE SHORT-GRASS VEGETATION, THE EXCLUSION OF LARGE MAMMALS INCREASED TOTAL PLANT BIOMASS, WHILE THE EXCLUSION OF LARGE AND MEDIUM-SIZED MAMMALS INCREASED TOTAL, GRASS AND FORB BIOMASS COMPARED TO WHEN ALL ANIMALS HAD ACCESS. THESE INCREASES BECAME STRONGER WHEN INVERTEBRATES WERE ALSO EXCLUDED.

IN CONTRAST TO THESE SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY-LEVEL RESPONSES FOUND IN THE SHORT-GRASS VEGETATION, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE SIZE-SELECTIVE EXCLUSION OF ANIMALS ALTERED THE PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF THE TALL-GRASS VEGETATION. THE CONTRASTING RESULTS WERE DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE IN PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION PRIOR TO OUR EXPERIMENT, WHICH WERE RELATED TO DIFFERENCES IN QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF FORAGE AND IN GRAZING INTENSITIES OF HERBIVORES BETWEEN THE TWO GRASSLAND TYPES. SYNTHESIS. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT DIFFERENT-SIZED ANIMALS, IN PARTICULAR LARGE MAMMALS AND INVERTEBRATES, CONTRIBUTED TO MAINTAIN THE PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN THE SHORT-GRASS VEGETATION, HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF MULTIPLE, FUNCTIONALLY DIFFERENT ANIMAL GROUPS FOR ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING AND STABILITY. IN CONTRAST TO THE SHORT-GRASS VEGETATION, WE COULD NOT DETECT SUCH A TOP-DOWN CONTROL BY ANIMALS IN THE TALL-GRASS VEGETATION.

BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION RELATIONSHIPS AS WELL AS THEIR LINK TO ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS CAN BE ASSESSED WITH THE BIOLOGICAL TRAIT ANALYSIS. WE USED THIS APPROACH FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR MACROFAUNA ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS THE DEEP FRAM STRAIT BETWEEN GREENLAND AND SVALBARD (1000–5500 M WATER DEPTH) TO EVALUATE THEIR COMMUNITY-SPECIFIC FUNCTION FROM THE UPPER CONTINENTAL SLOPE DOWN TO THE DEEPEST KNOWN ARCTIC DEPRESSION, THE MOLLOY DEEP.

TOTAL ENVIRON.,1,"HYDROLOGICAL DISCONNECTION IS INCREASINGLY THREATENING BIODIVERSITY IN RIVER FLOODPLAIN ECOSYSTEMS WORLDWIDE, BUT STUDIES REPORTING LONG-TERM CHANGE OF AQUATIC BIODIVERSITY IN RELATION TO FLOODPLAIN DISCONNECTION ARE SELDOM, ESPECIALLY FROM MULTIFACETED BIODIVERSITY PERSPECTIVES. HERE, WE EXAMINED HOW LOSS OF RIVER-LAKE CONNECTIVITY AFFECTED MULTIFACETED (TAXONOMIC, FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC) ALPHA AND BETA DIVERSITY OF FISH ASSEMBLAGES IN 11 YANGTZE RIVER FLOODPLAIN LAKES OVER THE PAST 70 YEARS. WE FOUND THAT ALL THREE FACETS OF ALPHA DIVERSITY SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED THROUGH TIME, BUT THE DECREASE RATE WAS HIGHEST (31.4%) IN TAXONOMIC RICHNESS, SECOND IN FUNCTIONAL (26.4%) AND LOWEST IN PHYLOGENETIC FACET (4.7%). NEVERTHELESS, TAXONOMIC, FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC STRUCTURES OF FISH FAUNA ALL EXHIBITED DIFFERENTIATION. THE TAXONOMIC AND PHYLOGENETIC DIFFERENTIATIONS WERE DUE TO THE JOINT INCREASES IN THEIR TURNOVER AND NESTEDNESS-RESULTANT COMPONENT, WHEREAS THE FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENTIATION WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN ITS TURNOVER COMPONENT. SUCH DISTINCT RESULTS WERE BECAUSE OF THE IMBALANCED EXTIRPATIONS OF FISH SPECIES (ESPECIALLY FROM SPECIES-POOR ORDERS AND FAMILIES) IN DISCONNECTED LAKES AND CONNECTED LAKES. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS OF STRONG CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CHANGES IN TAXONOMIC DISSIMILARITIES AND PHYLOGENETIC DISSIMILARITIES, WE GENERALLY FOUND WEAK CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CHANGES IN DIFFERENT FACETS OF BOTH ALPHA AND BETA DIVERSITY. THIS DISCREPANCY HIGHLIGHTS THAT MEASURING DIFFERENT BIODIVERSITY FACETS OFFER DISTINCT INFORMATION ABOUT BIODIVERSITY DYNAMICS AND CAN ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO DETECT AND EVALUATE THE IMPACTS OF FLOODPLAIN DISCONNECTION ON BIODIVERSITY. WE THEREFORE RECOMMEND AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH EMBRACING TAXONOMIC, FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY IS ESSENTIAL TO EFFECTIVE BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT AND CONSERVATION IN LARGE RIVER FLOODPLAINS. © 2020 ELSEVIER B.V.",144177,NA,STEVA,"PAN, B.; STATE KEY LABORATORY OF ECO-HYDRAULIC IN NORTHWEST ARID REGION OF CHINA, CHINA; EMAIL: ZHUZIPAN@XAUT.EDU.CN",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144177,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA, NSFC, 51709225, 51939009 NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SHAANXI PROVINCENATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SHAANXI PROVINCE, 2018JQ5121 XI'AN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGYXI'AN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, XUT, 104/256051715",489697,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,ENGLISH,NA,NA,15,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,33360512,SCOPUS,EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM FLOODPLAIN DISCONNECTION ON MULTIPLE FACETS OF LAKE FISH BIODIVERSITY: DECLINE OF ALPHA DIVERSITY LEADS TO A REGIONAL DIFFERENTIATION THROUGH TIME,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098052483&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2020.144177&partnerID=40&md5=7004f35824663f502355b9f5c4bede20,763,2021,"THIS WORK WAS FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (NOS. 51939009 , 51709225 ), NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SHAANXI PROVINCE ( 2018JQ5121 ), AND THE YOUNG SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INNOVATION TEAM PROJECT OF XI'AN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY ( 104/256051715 ).

CONSEQUENTLY, MANY MEADOW BIRDS HAVE DRASTICALLY DECLINED, AND THE HABITATS THEY SELECT FOR BREEDING CURRENTLY RELY ON LAND MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, THE SELECTION OF HABITATS MAINTAINED BY AGRICULTURE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCED FITNESS AND THUS REMAIN MALADAPTIVE FOR INDIVIDUALS, WHICH MAKES CONSERVATION CHALLENGING. AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SPECIES’ HABITAT SELECTION, FOOD SUPPLY AND LAND MANAGEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF SPECIES’ BEHAVIOUR IS THEREFORE CRUCIAL FOR CONSERVATION. LOWLAND POPULATIONS OF GREAT SNIPE GALLINAGO MEDIA ARE CURRENTLY DECLINING AT A MODERATE RATE, CAUSING A CONSERVATION CONCERN. WE EXAMINED THE DAYTIME SITE SELECTION (ASSUMED AS FORAGING SITES) AND FOOD SUPPLY OF RADIOTRACKED GREAT SNIPE MALES BREEDING ON A FLOODPLAIN IN NE POLAND. FORAGING SITES WERE CLASSIFIED AT MICRO- AND MACRO-SCALE LEVELS USING THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION IN A USE–AVAILABILITY DESIGN. ON THE MICRO-SCALE LEVEL, MALES SELECTED MODERATE SWARD HEIGHT AND DENSITY, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF BARE GROUND PATCHES, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE INCREASED AS THE BREEDING SEASON PROGRESSED. ON THE MACRO-SCALE LEVEL, THESE CONDITIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH (1) MEADOWS MOWN TWICE PER SEASON AND GRAZED THEREAFTER (ASSOCIATED WITH THE MOST ABUNDANT FOOD RESOURCES – EARTHWORMS) AND (2) EXTENSIVELY MANAGED PASTURES, SUGGESTING THE IMPORTANCE OF GRAZING. ABANDONED OR LATE-MOWN MEADOWS UNDER AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEMES (AES) WERE AVOIDED BY FORAGING MALES. HOWEVER, PARCELS WITH DELAYED MOWING OFFER SAFE BREEDING SITES FOR FEMALES NESTING CLOSE TO LEKS, UNLIKE LAND-USE TYPES PREFERRED BY FORAGING MALES, WHICH MAY ACT AS AN ECOLOGICAL TRAP.

HOWEVER, LIMITED RESOURCES IN TERMS OF BUDGET AND AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED FIELD PERSONNEL CAN RESTRICT THE GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE OF MONITORING EFFORTS. FOCUSING MONITORING EFFORTS ON A REPRESENTATIVE SUBSET OF SPECIES AND LOCATIONS CAN IMPROVE COST-EFFICIENCY. OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE OF MULTI-SPECIES INDICATORS DERIVED FROM SUCH AN APPROACH REQUIRES OBJECTIVE METHODS FOR SPECIES SELECTION AND A SAMPLING DESIGN THAT REDUCES INHERENT SAMPLING BIAS CAUSED BY REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN HABITAT AVAILABILITY OR ACCESSIBILITY. TO EXPLORE THE PERFORMANCE OF A MULTI-SPECIES INDICATOR ACROSS DIFFERENT REGIONS WITHIN A NATION, WE DEVELOPED A MULTI-SPECIES INDICATOR (MSI) FOR FARMLAND BIRDS IN NORWAY USING OBJECTIVE NICHE-BASED SELECTION OF SPECIES. WE COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS INDICATOR AT NATIONAL AND REGIONAL SCALES (CENTRAL AND EAST REGIONS) IN NORWAY, AND BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL SITES WITHIN REGIONS. THE SEVEN-SPECIES INDICATOR OBTAINED FROM THE SPECIES SELECTION PROVIDED SIMILAR INDICATOR VALUES AND TRENDS FOR NORWAY AND THE CENTRAL AND EAST REGIONS, AS WELL AS FOR RURAL SITES WITHIN THE COMBINED CENTRAL + EAST REGION. ALL TRENDS WERE DEFINED AS SHOWING MODERATE DECLINE FROM 2007–2016. URBAN SITES WITHIN THE COMBINED CENTRAL + EAST REGION PROVIDED TREND ESTIMATES THAT SHOWED STRONGER DECLINE THAN RURAL AREAS IN THE SAME REGION DURING THE TIME SPAN. OUR RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO CONTROL FOR SAMPLING BIAS WHEN STRUCTURING MONITORING PROGRAMMES SUCH AS A BREEDING BIRD SURVEY (BBS). THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IF LIMITED RESOURCES RESTRICT THE GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE OF THE MONITORING SCHEME. WE RECOMMEND THAT MONITORING SCHEMES FOLLOW A STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING DESIGN THAT REPRESENTS BOTH THE AVAILABILITY OF DIFFERENT LAND COVER TYPES AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION WITH REGARD TO PROXIMITY TO HIGHLY POPULATED AREAS. IF THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE, STATISTICALLY WEIGHTING DATA FROM DIFFERENT REGIONS OR LANDSCAPES IS LIKELY TO BE NECESSARY. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

TO AVOID DIVERSITY LOSS, IT IS NECESSARY TO MONITOR BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DNA (EDNA) METABARCODING HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS A RAPID, NONINVASIVE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR AQUATIC BIODIVERSITY MONITORING. ALTHOUGH THIS METHOD HAS BEEN APPLIED TO VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTS AND TAXA, A DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFICIENT SAMPLING METHODS FOR MONITORING IS STILL REQUIRED. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXPLORED EDNA METABARCODING SAMPLING METHODS FOR FISH AT A SINGLE SITE TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF DETECTED SPECIES USING REALISTIC EFFORT IN A NATURAL, SMALL RIVER. WE CONSIDERED THE FOLLOWING THREE PARAMETERS: SAMPLE TYPE (WATER OR SEDIMENT), SAMPLE POSITION AT A SITE (RIGHT AND LEFT SHORE AND CENTER OF THE RIVER), AND WATER VOLUME (10–4000 ML). THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THE NUMBER OF DETECTED SPECIES FROM SEDIMENTARY EDNA WAS EQUIVALENT TO THAT FROM AQUEOUS EDNA, ALTHOUGH THE SPECIES COMPOSITION WAS DIFFERENT. THE NUMBER OF DETECTED SPECIES COULD BE SATURATED BY COLLECTING A 1000 ML WATER SAMPLE, REGARDLESS OF SAMPLING POSITION WITHIN A SURVEY SITE. HOWEVER, SEDIMENTARY EDNA SHOWED A SPATIALLY HETEROGENEOUS SPECIES COMPOSITION BETWEEN SAMPLING POSITIONS WITHIN A SURVEY SITE DESPITE THE SHORT DISTANCE (5 M) BETWEEN POSITIONS, WITHOUT APPARENT DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICAL PROPERTIES SUCH AS VELOCITY AND SEDIMENT PARTICLE DISTRIBUTION. BY COMPLETING EDNA BIODIVERSITY MONITORING OF FISH WITH 1000 ML WATER SAMPLES ACROSS THE WHOLE RIVER, WE DETECTED MORE FISH SPECIES THAN IN PREVIOUS TRADITIONAL SURVEYS CONDUCTED AT THE SAME SITES. THUS, THE AQUEOUS EDNA METABARCODING METHOD IS AS EFFICIENT AS TRADITIONAL SURVEYS, WHILE SEDIMENTARY EDNA METABARCODING COULD COMPLEMENT THE RESULTS OF AQUEOUS EDNA METABARCODING. © 2020, THE JAPANESE SOCIETY OF LIMNOLOGY.",NA,NA,NA,"SAKATA, M.K.; GRADUATE SCHOOL OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENT, 3-11, TSURUKABUTO, NADA-KU, JAPAN; EMAIL: MASA2K_MSKK1518@YAHOO.CO.JP",ARTICLE,10.1007/s10201-020-00645-9,"JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCEJAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCE, KAKEN, 19J11126, 20H03326",14398621,LIMNOLOGY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,17,2,221-235,SPRINGER JAPAN,NA,SCOPUS,"DETERMINING AN EFFECTIVE SAMPLING METHOD FOR EDNA METABARCODING: A CASE STUDY FOR FISH BIODIVERSITY MONITORING IN A SMALL, NATURAL RIVER",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095979632&doi=10.1007%2fs10201-020-00645-9&partnerID=40&md5=6482f6e4582f2f46be372dcd00f7772c,22,2021,"WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK MR.

HOW CAN SUCH A PARADOX BE BEST SOLVED? THIS PARADOX REQUIRES AN ADAPTIVE, CONTEXT-SPECIFIC, DYNAMIC SOLUTION, AT A FINE-GRAINED SCALE THAT VARIES BY LOCATION. THE WILD CHIMPANZEE FOUNDATION (WCF) WORKS ON THE GROUND IN THREE WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES: IN CÔTE D'IVOIRE, WHERE BUSHMEAT CONSUMPTION IS A RECURRENT AND GENERALIZED THREAT TO WILDLIFE, WCF USED LIVE THEATER PERFORMANCES IN THE VILLAGES TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. POST-ACTIVITY EVALUATIONS REVEALED THAT THE MORE OFTEN INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN PART OF SUCH AWARENESS ACTIVITIES, THE LESS THEY WILL CONSUME BUSHMEAT. IN NEARBY LIBERIA, WHERE ILLEGAL MINERS HAVE INVADED MANY PROTECTED AREAS AND INTACT FORESTS, THE WCF SUPPORTS COMMUNITY WATCH TEAMS (CWT) TO PATROL THE SAPO NATIONAL PARK WITH FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY STAFF. WITHIN 11 MONTHS OF ITS CREATION, THE CWT PATROLS AROUND AND IN THE SAPO NATIONAL PARK RESULTED IN THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL MINERS PROGRESSIVELY LEAVING THE NATIONAL PARK. IN GUINEA, WHERE COEXISTENCE BETWEEN HUMANS AND PRIMATES HAS PREVAILED BASED ON RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS, THE WCF DEVELOPED A STRATEGIC APPROACH, AS THE MOYEN-BAFING NATIONAL PARK CONTAINS ABOUT 5000 CHIMPANZEES AS WELL AS SOME 255 VILLAGES. THEREFORE, WE ADOPTED AN “INTEGRATED LANDSCAPE APPROACH” WHEREBY THE COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES ARE PLANNED IN COMBINATION WITH INITIATIVES INCREASING FOREST REGENERATION AND CONNECTIVITY IN HIGH CONSERVATION VALUE AREAS.

WE ALSO NEED TO DETERMINE WHICH SPECIES TRAITS EXPLAIN THE EFFECTS OF SHRUB ENCROACHMENT AND LAND-USE CHANGES TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL DRIVERS OF COMMUNITY CHANGE AND PREDICT SPECIES' RESPONSES TO CONSERVATION EFFORTS. WE SAMPLED BIRDS ACROSS GRADIENTS OF SHRUB ENCROACHMENT AND LAND USE (PROTECTED SAVANNA, PASTURES, HOMESTEAD LANDS, AND SUGARCANE) IN THE LOWVELD SAVANNA OF ESWATINI TO: (1) TEST FOR THE EFFECTS OF SHRUB ENCROACHMENT, LAND-USE CHANGE, AND THEIR POTENTIAL SYNERGIES ON THE OCCURRENCE OF 48 SPECIES OF BIRDS; AND (2) DETERMINE WHICH SPECIES TRAITS (THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH NESTING, FORAGING, OR VULNERABILITY TO PREDATION) EXPLAINED SPECIES' ASSOCIATIONS WITH SHRUB ENCROACHMENT AND LAND-USE CHANGE. WE USED BAYESIAN MULTISPECIES OCCUPANCY MODELS TO ACCOUNT FOR IMPERFECT DETECTION, INTERPRET SPECIES RESPONSES, AND UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF SPECIES TRAITS. WE FOUND EVIDENCE FOR COMMUNITY-WIDE SYNERGIES BETWEEN SHRUB ENCROACHMENT AND LAND-USE EFFECTS ON BIRDS THAT VARIED WITH SPECIES' DIETS. AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION HAD NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE OCCURRENCE OF MOST SPECIES EXAMINED, WHILE SHRUB COVER TYPICALLY HAD POSITIVE EFFECTS WHICH WERE STRONGER IN PASTURES AND HOMESTEAD LANDS THAN IN PROTECTED AREAS. THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF LAND-USE CHANGE WERE GREATEST FOR INSECTIVORES AND CAVITY NESTERS, WHEREAS INSECTIVORE OCCURRENCE INCREASED WITH SHRUB COVER, COLLECTIVELY INDICATING THAT NESTING AND FORAGING TRAITS BEST EXPLAINED SPECIES RESPONSES TO LAND-USE AND LAND-COVER CHANGE IN THE REGION.

IN THIS STUDY WE COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF CL AND RIL ON STREAM AMPHIBIANS ACROSS A REGENERATION GRADIENT IN TWO FOREST RESERVES IN SABAH, MALAYSIAN BORNEO. WE ANALYSED DATA FROM A COMMUNITY OF STREAM AMPHIBIANS ACROSS 29 TRANSECTS SUBJECT TO EITHER CL (18 – 21 YEARS SINCE LOGGING) OR RIL (4 – 21).

DIVERSITY PROFILES, WHICH CAPTURE REPRESENTATIVE DIVERSITY INDICES WHILST ACCOUNTING FOR COMMUNITY EVENNESS, WERE CALCULATED USING OCCUPANCY MODEL RESULTS. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT SEVERAL SPECIES AND COMMUNITY OCCUPANCY GENERALLY RESPONDED NEGATIVELY TO LOGGING ASSOCIATED COVARIATES (LOWER ABOVEGROUND CARBON DENSITY AND HIGHER SILTATION). STREAM BREEDING SPECIES OCCUPANCY WAS GENERALLY LOWER IN CL COMPARED TO RIL SITES, WITH HIGHER GENERALIST BREEDING SPECIES OCCUPANCY IN CL SITES. DIVERSITY PROFILES IDENTIFIED HIGHER ANURAN DIVERSITY AND EVENNESS IN RIL COMPARED TO CL SITES OF THE SAME AGE (18 – 21 YEARS). FURTHERMORE, ANURAN DIVERSITY AND EVENNESS EXHIBITED A DISTINCT RECOVERY FROM 4 TO 21 YEARS FOLLOWING RIL. OUR RESULTS PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE THAT RIL REDUCES THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON STREAM HABITATS, AMPHIBIAN OCCUPANCY AND DIVERSITY COMPARED TO CL, AND SUGGEST A FAR QUICKER RECOVERY AFTER RIL.

THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE OPPORTUNITIES AND BENEFITS OF APPLYING THE CONCEPTS OF REGREENING AND REWILDING OF CITIES. THE ARTICLE ENGAGES WITH KEY SOURCES AND SUMMARIZES THE BACKGROUND AND DEVELOPMENT OF REGREENING AND NATURE‐BASED SOLUTIONS AND IMPORTANT POLICIES, CONCERNS AND PERSPECTIVES OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. IT INTRODUCES THE INTEGRATION OF NATURE‐BASED SOLUTIONS (NBS) AS A STRATEGY IN URBAN PLANNING WITH THE AIM TO STRENGTHEN URBAN RESILIENCE AND TO SLOW DOWN THE BIODIVERSITY DE-CLINE. REWILDING AREAS IN CITIES HAS BECOME A POWERFUL STRATEGY TO BRING BACK BUTTERFLIES, INSECTS, BIRDS, AND WILDLIFE. IN CONTRAST TO HIGHLY MANAGED PARKS AND GARDENS, THESE REWILDING INITIATIVES ARE LEAVING ALLOTTED SPACES MOSTLY UNCULTIVATED AND SELF‐REGULATED. CONTACT TO NATURE IS ESSENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXISTENCE, URBAN WELLBEING, AND GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE. GREEN SPACES IN CITIES—BIG OR SMALL—ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF RESIDENTS. HOWEVER, MANY CITIES DO NOT OFFER RESIDENTS EASY ACCESS TO GREEN SPACE WITHIN THE CITY. IMPROVING THE BETTER DISTRIBUTION OF AND ACCESS TO GREEN SPACES AND EXTENDING GARDENS AND PARKS IS LIKELY TO DELIVER A LARGE NUMBER OF BENEFITS, SUCH AS: ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, BETTER WATER MANAGEMENT FOR ENHANCED URBAN FLOOD CONTROL, SLOWING DOWN THE BIODIVERSITY LOSS, CONTRIBUTING TO FOOD SECURITY, AND RESTORING DAMAGED ECOSYSTEMS. FURTHERMORE, ADDITIONAL GREEN SPACE AND NBS HELP TO KEEP CITIES COOL DURING HEATWAVES AND IMPROVE THE URBAN MICROCLI-MATE. REWILDING HAS EMERGED AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF NEW PUBLIC PARKS AND GARDENS. THE NEXT STEP IS TO UP‐SCALE CITYWIDE CLIMATE INTERVENTION STRATEGIES DEPLOYED TO KEEP CITIES COOL. HOWEVER, AS THE DISCUSSION OF THIS ARTICLE SHOWS, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE DESIGN OF THESE NBS STRATEGIES IS FULLY INTEGRATED WITH OTHER COMPLEMENTARY PLANNING INTERVENTIONS AND SEEKS SYNERGIES ACROSS ALL SECTORS. © 2021 BY THE AUTHOR.

A KEY KNOWLEDGE GAP IS UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF HABITAT MODIFICATION ON MECHANISMS OF COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY, WHICH ARE PREDICTED TO RESPOND DIFFERENTLY BETWEEN TAXA AND ACROSS SPATIAL SCALES. WE USE A NULL MODEL APPROACH TO DETECT TRAIT ASSEMBLY OF SPECIES AT LOCAL- AND LANDSCAPE-SCALES, AND THEN SUBDIVIDE COMMUNITIES WITH DIFFERENT HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS AND FORAGING GUILDS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE DETECTION OF ASSEMBLY MECHANISMS VARIES BETWEEN GROUPS. WE FOCUS ON TWO INDICATOR TAXA, DUNG BEETLES AND BIRDS, ACROSS A DISTURBANCE GRADIENT OF PRIMARY RAINFOREST, SELECTIVELY LOGGED RAINFOREST, AND OIL PALM PLANTATIONS IN BORNEO, SOUTHEAST ASIA. RANDOM COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY WAS PREDOMINANT FOR DUNG BEETLES ACROSS HABITATS, WHEREAS TRAIT CONVERGENCE, INDICATIVE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERING, OCCURRED ACROSS THE DISTURBANCE GRADIENT FOR BIRDS.

SEEDS TREATED WITH EITHER INSECTICIDES OR ANTHRAQUINONE (AQ) WERE NOT CONSUMED IN PLANTED FIELDS WHILE UNTREATED SEEDS WERE, CAUSING A 19.6% REDUCTION IN SEEDLING DENSITY WHERE CRANES FORAGED. INSECTICIDES TESTED WERE INAPPROPRIATE FOR FUTURE USE WHILE PERFORMANCE OF AQ MIMICKED THAT OF INSECTICIDES BUT WAS ENVIRONMENTALLY ACCEPTABLE AND ECONOMICAL TO USE.

WE COMPARE SYNERGISTIC PALAEOCLIMATE INTERACTION (A SHORT-TERM CHANGE ON TOP OF A LONG-TERM TREND IN THE SAME DIRECTION) TO ANTAGONISTIC PALAEOCLIMATE INTERACTION SUCH AS LONG-TERM COOLING FOLLOWED BY SHORT-TERM WARMING. SYNERGISTIC PALAEOCLIMATE INTERACTION INCREASES EXTINCTION RISK BY UP TO 40%.

LAND USE PLANNING INITIATIVES SEEKING TO OPTIMIZE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION ARE HINDERED BY A LACK OF BASELINE DATA QUANTIFYING SPECIES’ TOLERANCE TO HUMAN-MODIFIED LANDSCAPES. OBJECTIVES: WE EXPLORED THE INFLUENCE OF LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS ON THE FINE-SCALE SPACE-USE PATTERNS OF A MODEL GENERALIST CARNIVORE, THE MALAY CIVET (VIVERRA TANGALUNGA), WITHIN DEGRADED TROPICAL FORESTS AND OIL PALM PLANTATIONS. METHODS: WE COLLECTED OVER 20,000 GPS LOCATIONS FROM 21 MALE CIVETS IN SABAH, MALAYSIAN BORNEO TO EVALUATE THE SPECIES’ SPACE-USE PATTERNS AND HABITAT UTILIZATION PROCESSES. WE USED MOVEMENT-BASED MODELING TO DETERMINE HOME RANGES, AND COMBINED THE RESULTS WITH HIGH-RESOLUTION REMOTELY SENSED HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS. WE DEVELOPED RESOURCE UTILIZATION FUNCTIONS TO DETERMINE INDIVIDUAL AND POPULATION-LEVEL FUNCTIONAL RESPONSES TO PROXIMITY TO PLANTATION EDGE, DISTANCE TO WATER, TERRAIN RUGGEDNESS, FOREST STRUCTURE, AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY. RESULTS: CIVETS FORAGED WITHIN OIL PALM PLANTATIONS, YET ALL ANIMALS UTILIZED FORESTS. HOME RANGES SCALED WITH PROPORTION OF PLANTATION WITHIN BOTH TOTAL AND CORE RANGES. RESOURCE UTILIZATION FUNCTIONS REPORTED INDIVIDUALISM IN THE SPECIES’ RESPONSES TO HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS. AT THE POPULATION-SCALE, CIVETS CONSISTENTLY AND MORE INTENSELY USED HABITATS CLOSER TO PLANTATION EDGES AND TALLER TREE CANOPIES. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH PLANTATIONS DID NOT POSE AN INHOSPITABLE MATRIX, OIL PALM AGRICULTURE IS A LESS SUITABLE HABITAT THAN REMNANT FORESTS FOR CIVETS. PROXIMITY MEASURES AND FOREST STRUCTURE INFLUENCED THE SPATIAL BEHAVIORS OF THIS ADAPTABLE GENERALIST, HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTED AREAS.

HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES HAVE MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE DIRECT EFFECT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES ON A SINGLE GROUP, DESPITE THE FACT THAT ANTHROPOGENICALLY INDUCED BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN ECOSYSTEMS OCCURS ACROSS MULTIPLE TROPHIC LEVELS AND MAY DEPEND ON BOTH ALTERED HABITAT (E.G., WATER CHEMISTRY) AND ON TROPHIC INTERACTIONS CASCADING UP THE TROPHIC NETWORK. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYZED THE SIMULTANEOUS DIRECT, WATER-CHEMISTRY MEDIATED AND TROPHIC NETWORK CASCADING EFFECTS OF THE OVERALL HUMAN-IMPACT INTENSIFICATION ON DENSITY (BIOMASS/ABUNDANCE) AND RICHNESS (NUMBER OF TAXA) ACROSS ALL TROPHIC LEVELS IN POND ECOSYSTEMS. FOR THIS, WE COLLECTED AND COMBINED MULTI-TAXON DATA (341 TAXA) FOR MACROPHYTES, PHYTOPLANKTON, ZOOPLANKTON, BENTHIC AND EPIPHYTIC MACROINVERTEBRATES, AND FISHES. WE SHOWED THAT HUMAN-IMPACT INTENSIFICATION AFFECTED THE DENSITIES AND RICHNESS OF ALMOST ALL TROPHIC LEVELS ACROSS THE STUDY ECOSYSTEMS, AND RESULTED IN AN OVERALL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE MULTITROPHIC DIVERSITY OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. WE DETECTED DIRECT EFFECT OF HUMAN-IMPACT INTENSIFICATION, BUT NO INDIRECT EFFECTS, ON THE RICHNESS OF PRIMARY PRODUCERS. IN CONTRAST, THE INDIRECT EFFECTS MEDIATED THROUGH THE NUTRIENT CONTENT IN THE WATER WERE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL DRIVERS OF MULTITROPHIC DIVERSITY IN THE INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE INDIRECT EFFECTS THROUGH THE TROPHIC NETWORK CASCADES WERE DETECTED MAINLY WITHIN THE FISH COMMUNITY.

WE INVESTIGATED THE BIODIVERSITY AND BIRD SURVEYS CONDUCTED AND THE NUMBER OF BIRD SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN IN PEAT EXTRACTION AND WIND FARM PROJECTS TO WHICH AN EIA WAS APPLIED TO IN 1995–2016 IN FINLAND AND COMPARED WHETHER THESE FACTORS DIFFERED BETWEEN THE PROJECT TYPES AND BETWEEN IMPLEMENTED AND UNIMPLEMENTED PROJECTS. WE ALSO STUDIED THE AVAILABILITY OF FOLLOW-UP MONITORING DATA OF BIODIVERSITY IMPACTS WITHIN THE TWO PROJECT TYPES. THE NUMBER OF NATIONALLY THREATENED BREEDING BIRDS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN IMPLEMENTED THAN IN UNIMPLEMENTED PEAT EXTRACTION PROJECTS. THE OVERALL PROBABILITY OF BEING IMPLEMENTED WAS SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE YEAR THE EIA BEGAN FOR BOTH PROJECT TYPES.

HERE, WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO BIRD PHYLOGENETIC INDEXES OF DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE, LEADING TO OVER-DISPERSED PHYLOGENIES IN VERY HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES. WE ANALYZED PHYLOGENETIC RESPONSES IN INTERFACES BETWEEN FOREST EDGES AND ANTHROPOGENIC MATRICES (FOREST–PASTURE AND FOREST–EUCALYPTUS) USING GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS. WE ALSO COMPARED THESE INDEXES BETWEEN LAND COVERS TO ASSESS WHICH ONE BEST PRESERVES THE PHYLOGENETIC HISTORY OF COMMUNITIES. WE USED BOTH TRADITIONAL PHYLOGENETIC INDEXES AND THOSE CORRECTED FOR SPECIES RICHNESS. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN LAND COVER TYPES, BUT THIS DID NOT OCCUR WHEN WE REMOVED EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIES RICHNESS, SUGGESTING THAT ALL LAND COVERS PRESERVE SIMILAR LEVELS OF EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY. ADDITIONALLY, OUR BEST MODELS SHOWED A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY AND BIRD PHYLOGENETIC INDEXES OF DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE, BUT THE STRENGTH OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS MAY BE LAND COVER DEPENDENT.

WE TESTED THE GENETIC COMPOSITION OF THE CRYPTIC PHOXINUS POPULATIONS INHABITING THESE WATERS, AS THE SPECIES ARE MORPHOLOGICALLY INDISTINCT. SEQUENCES OF THE MITOCHONDRIAL CYTOCHROME OXIDASE I (COI) WERE OBTAINED FROM 239 SPECIMENS, WITH THE RESULTS INDICATING THAT 17 ALPINE HIGH-ALTITUDE LAKES ARE NOW POPULATED BY A COMPLEX OF PHOXINUS SPECIES, COMPRISING P.

THEREFORE, DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE DISINFECTION METHODS TO MANAGE THE IMPACT OF DISEASES IN WILD AND CAPTIVE “ARK” POPULATIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT GOAL IN AMPHIBIAN CONSERVATION. WHILE CHEMICAL DISINFECTANTS HAVE BEEN USED SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY IN LARVAL AND ADULT AMPHIBIANS INFECTED WITH PATHOGENIC MICROBES, THEIR APPLICABILITY TO AMPHIBIAN EGG MASSES HAS REMAINED UNTESTED. TO BRIDGE THIS GAP, WE EXPOSED EMBRYOS OF THE COMMON TOAD (BUFO BUFO) AND AGILE FROG (RANA DALMATINA) EXPERIMENTALLY TO THREE WIDELY USED DISINFECTANTS: VORICONAZOLE, CHLORAMPHENICOL AND CHLOROGEN-SESQUIHYDRATE. FOR 3 DAYS WE EXPOSED PORTIONS OF EGG MASSES TO THESE DISINFECTANTS AT 1×, 2×, 5× AND 10× THE CONCENTRATION RECOMMENDED FOR THE DISINFECTION OF TADPOLES AND ADULTS. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE RECORDED EMBRYONIC AND LARVAL SURVIVAL, AS WELL AS LARVAL BODY MASS AND THE INCIDENCE OF ABNORMALITIES 12 DAYS AFTER HATCHING. APPLICATION OF VORICONAZOLE HAD SPECIES- AND CONCENTRATION-DEPENDENT NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON SURVIVAL AND BODY MASS, AND CAUSED MARKED MALFORMATIONS IN THE VISCEROCRANIAL STRUCTURE OF B. BUFO TADPOLES. EXPOSURE TO CHLOROGEN-SESQUIHYDRATE ALSO RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY IN B. BUFO EMBRYOS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BODY MASS OF R. DALMATINA LARVAE. CHLORAMPHENICOL HAD LITTLE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON EMBRYOS OR LARVAE IN EITHER SPECIES.

THE EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE DISTURBANCE GENERALLY VARY AMONG SPECIES AND DEPEND ON THE NATURE OF THE DISTURBANCES, WHICH MAY INTERACT AND RESULT IN SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS. WESTERN CANADA'S OIL SANDS REGION EXPERIENCES DISTURBANCES FROM FORESTRY AND ENERGY SECTOR ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS MUNICIPAL AND TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. THE EFFECTS OF THOSE DISTURBANCES ON SINGLE SPECIES HAVE BEEN STUDIED AND HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN DECLINES OF THE BOREAL WOODLAND CARIBOU (RANGIFER TARANDUS CARIBOU). YET, THE SPECIFIC RESPONSES OF THE MAMMAL COMMUNITY, AND OF FUNCTIONAL GROUPS SUCH AS PREY AND PREDATORS, TO THOSE INTERACTING DISTURBANCES ARE STILL POORLY KNOWN. WE INVESTIGATED THE RESPONSES OF BLACK BEAR, GREY WOLF, COYOTE, FISHER, LYNX, RED FOX, AMERICAN RED SQUIRREL, WHITE-TAILED DEER, MOOSE, CARIBOU, AND SNOWSHOE HARE TO BOTH NATURAL HABITAT AND DISTURBANCE ASSOCIATED WITH ANTHROPOGENIC FEATURES WITHIN ALBERTA'S NORTHEAST BOREAL FOREST. WE USED A NOVEL COMMUNITY-LEVEL MODELLING FRAMEWORK ON THREE YEARS OF CAMERA-TRAP DATA COLLECTED IN AN OIL SANDS LANDSCAPE. THIS FRAMEWORK ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY THE NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC FEATURES WHICH EXPLAINED THE MOST VARIATION IN OCCURRENCE FREQUENCY AMONG FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, AS WELL AS COMPARE RESPONSES TO LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE. OCCURRENCE FREQUENCY BY PREDATORS WAS BETTER EXPLAINED BY ANTHROPOGENIC FEATURES THAN BY NATURAL HABITAT. BOTH LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR ANTHROPOGENIC FEATURES HELPED EXPLAIN OCCURRENCE FREQUENCY BY PREY AND PREDATORS, ALTHOUGH THE EFFECTS DIFFERED IN MAGNITUDE AND SPATIAL SCALE. TO BETTER CONSERVE BOREAL BIODIVERSITY, MANAGEMENT ACTIONS SHOULD EXTEND BEYOND A FOCUS ON CARIBOU AND WOLVES AND AIM TO RESTORE HABITAT ACROSS A DIVERSITY OF ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES AND MONITOR THE DYNAMICS OF THE ENTIRE MAMMAL COMMUNITY. © 2020 ELSEVIER B.V.",142500,NA,STEVA,"WITTISCHE, J.; DÉPARTEMENT DE SCIENCES BIOLOGIQUES, 1375 AVENUE THÉRÈSE-LAVOIE-ROUX, CANADA; EMAIL: JWITTISCHE@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142500,"ALBERTA CONSERVATION ASSOCIATIONALBERTA CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION, ACA ALBERTA ENVIRONMENT AND PARKSALBERTA ENVIRONMENT AND PARKS, AEP PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY ALLIANCE CANADAPETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY ALLIANCE CANADA, PTAC NATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADANATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA, NSERC CANADA RESEARCH CHAIRSCANADA RESEARCH CHAIRS",489697,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,ENGLISH,NA,NA,11,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,33049527,SCOPUS,COMMUNITY-LEVEL MODELLING OF BOREAL FOREST MAMMAL DISTRIBUTION IN AN OIL SANDS LANDSCAPE,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092229256&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2020.142500&partnerID=40&md5=0d1571f4c78e60454f60bcda5ae12f83,755,2021,"DATA COLLECTION WAS FUNDED BY INNOTECH ALBERTA INC., AEP, THE PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY ALLIANCE OF CANADA AUPRF, MEG ENERGY AND THE ALBERTA CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION.

LOSS OF PLANT SPECIES IS COMMON IN NATURAL ASSEMBLED COMMUNITY, WHEREAS THE RESPONSE OF ECOSYSTEM PROCESS REMAINS UNCLEARLY. THE CONTINUOUS OVERGRAZING OF LIVESTOCK HAS RESULTED SIGNIFICANT PLANT SPECIES LOSS, LIKE PALATABLE GRASS AND SEDGE SPECIES IN ALPINE MEADOW ON THE QINGHAI-TIBET PLATEAU. IN THIS STUDY, WE CONDUCTED A PLANT REMOVAL EXPERIMENT TO SIMULATE THE SPECIES LOSS ALONG RETROGRESSIVE SUCCESSION GRADIENT OF ALPINE MEADOW RESULTING FROM LONG TERM OVERGRAZING. A TYPICAL ALPINE MEADOW LOCATED ON THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE PLATEAU WAS SELECTED AS THE OBJECT TO CONDUCT THE REMOVAL MANIPULATION. THE STUDY SITE WAS FENCED IN APRIL 2014 AFTER THE LONG TERM MODERATE WINTER GRAZING OF YAKS TO EXCLUDE GRAZING OF HERBIVORES. SIX REMOVAL TREATMENTS INCLUDING: REMOVE NO PLANT SPECIES, REMOVE CRASS, REMOVE CRASS AND SEDGE, REMOVE ALL SPECIES, RANDOMLY REMOVE 25% OF COMMUNITY ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS, AND RANDOMLY REMOVE 50% OF COMMUNITY ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS. IN MIDDLE JULY 2014 AND 2015, WE REMOVED ABOVEGROUND PART OF SPECIFIC PLANT SPECIES INDIVIDUALS IN 1 M X 1 M PLOTS. IN LATE JULY 2016, THE COMMUNITY COVERAGE, HEIGHT, SPECIES COMPOSITION, DIVERSITY INDICES AND BIOMASS WERE INVESTIGATED BASED ON 0.5 M×0.5 M QUADRATS TO DETECT RESPONSE OF ALPINE MEADOW TO THE REMOVAL EXPERIMENT. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT (1) REMOVAL OF PLANT FUNCTIONAL GROUP (PFG) DECREASED THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE HEIGHT OF COMMUNITY, BUT HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE CUMULATIVE COVERAGE OF COMMUNITY. (2) REMOVAL MANIPULATION SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE SUMMED DOMINANCE RATIO (SDR) OF CRASS AND FORB GROUP, WHILE NO SIGNIFICANT FOR SEDGE GROUP. (3) REMOVAL OF PFC INCREASED THE SPECIES EVENNESS, AND SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED PFC DIVERSITY AND DOMINANCE, WHEREAS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR OTHER DIVERSITY INDICES. (4) REMOVAL OF PFC REDUCED THE LITTER BIOMASS AND CRASS BIOMASS. ONLY THE REMOVAL OF ALL PLANT REDUCED THE COMMUNITY ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS. (5) IN ADDITION, FURTHER ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE COMMUNITY ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS WAS MAINLY DEPENDING ON THE CRASS GROUP, AND DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE INCREASE OF SPECIES EVENNESS. AND SIGNIFICANTLY COMPETITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WERE FOUND AMONG CRASS, SEDGE AND FORB GROUPS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT CRASS SPECIES IN THE ALPINE MEADOW COMMUNITY HAVE THE GREATEST COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, THE LOSS OF PLANT SPECIES COULD CHANGE THE COMMUNITY PROPERTIES BY MEANS OF INFLUENCING THE INTER-SPECIFIC COMPETITIVE RELATIONSHIPS AND SIGNIFICANT PLANT BIOMASS LOSS.

ENTOMOL.,0,"THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF NATIVE INVERTEBRATES IS DECLINING GLOBALLY, WHICH COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES FOR ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING. DECLINES ARE LIKELY TO BE AT LEAST AS SEVERE AS THOSE OBSERVED FOR VERTEBRATES, ALTHOUGH OFTEN ARE DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY DUE TO A LACK OF HISTORIC BASELINE DATA AND LIMITED MONITORING EFFORT. THE LEPIDOPTERA ARE WELL STUDIED IN AUSTRALIA COMPARED WITH OTHER INVERTEBRATES, SO WE KNOW THAT SOME SPECIES ARE IMPERILLED OR DECLINING. DESPITE THIS, FEW BUTTERFLY TAXA ARE EXPLICITLY LISTED FOR PROTECTION BY LEGISLATION. HERE WE AIM TO IDENTIFY THE BUTTERFLY TAXA THAT WOULD MOST BENEFIT FROM LISTING BY DETERMINING THE AUSTRALIAN BUTTERFLIES AT MOST IMMEDIATE RISK OF EXTINCTION. WE ALSO IDENTIFY THE RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT ACTIONS NEEDED TO RETAIN THEM. FOR 26 TAXA IDENTIFIED BY EXPERTS AND VARIOUS CONSERVATION SCHEDULES, WE USED STRUCTURED EXPERT ELICITATION TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY OF EXTINCTION WITHIN 20 YEARS (I.E. BY 2040) AND TO IDENTIFY KEY THREATENING PROCESSES, PRIORITY RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT NEEDS. COLLATION AND ANALYSIS OF EXPERT OPINION INDICATED THAT ONE TAXON, THE LACED FRITILLARY (ARGYNNIS HYPERBIUS INCONSTANS), IS PARTICULARLY IMPERILLED, AND THAT FOUR TAXA (JALMENUS EUBULUS, JALMENUS ARIDUS, HYPOCHRYSOPS PICEATUS AND OREISPLANUS MUNIONGA LARANA) HAVE A MODERATE–HIGH (>30%) RISK OF EXTINCTION BY 2040. MAPPED DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE 26 BUTTERFLIES REVEALED THAT MOST ARE ENDEMIC TO A SINGLE STATE OR TERRITORY, AND THAT MANY OCCUPY NARROW RANGES. INAPPROPRIATE FIRE REGIMES, HABITAT LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION (THROUGH AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES), INVASIVE SPECIES (MOSTLY THROUGH HABITAT DEGRADATION CAUSED BY WEEDS AND RABBITS) AND CLIMATE CHANGE WERE THE MOST PREVALENT THREATS AFFECTING THE TAXA CONSIDERED. INCREASED RESOURCING AND MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION WILL BE REQUIRED TO PREVENT THESE EXTINCTIONS.

INDIC.,1,"THE RAPID EXTINCTION OF SPECIES OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES HAS CREATED A BIODIVERSITY CRISIS. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO RECENT EXTIRPATIONS ARE LINKED TO INCREASED HUMAN POPULATION GROWTH, HABITAT LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION, AND OVER-EXPLOITATION OF WILDLIFE. ONLY DECISIVE, EFFECTIVE ACTION TO COMBAT BIODIVERSITY LOSS CAN REVERSE THESE TRENDS. THE USE OF INDICATOR SPECIES AS SURROGATES FOR BIODIVERSITY PROVIDES A WAY TO IDENTIFY AREAS WITH HIGH BIODIVERSITY SO THAT CONSERVATION EFFORTS CAN BE ACCELERATED AND SUPPORTED IN THOSE AREAS. PREDATORS ARE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF HEALTHY, BIODIVERSE ECOSYSTEMS DUE TO THEIR HIGH TROPHIC LEVEL AND THEIR DIRECT AND INDIRECT INTERACTION WITH OTHER SPECIES. USING CAMERA TRAP DATA FROM 221 CAMERAS SET ACROSS FIVE VEGETATION TYPES AND FIVE LAND USE ZONES IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE EVALUATED CARNIVORES AS POTENTIAL SURROGATES FOR BIODIVERSITY. WE USED THE LEOPARD (PANTHERA PARDUS), AND THREE MESO-PREDATORS: CARACAL (CARACAL CARACAL), HONEY BADGER (MELLIVORA CAPENSIS), AND BLACK-BACKED JACKAL (CANIS MESOMELAS), AS CANDIDATE INDICATOR SPECIES. WE USED MAMMALS CAPTURED AT THE CAMERA TRAPS AS A MEASURE OF BIODIVERSITY REFERRED TO AS MAMMALIAN SPECIES RICHNESS. THE MAMMALIAN SPECIES RICHNESS WAS HIGHEST IN THE ORANGE RIVER NAMA KAROO VEGETATION TYPE AND IN PRIVATELY OWNED GAME RESERVES. WE FOUND THAT PREDATOR SIGHTINGS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MAMMALIAN SPECIES RICHNESS WHICH INCREASED WITH INCREASING NUMBER OF PREDATOR SPECIES.

COMMONLY, SUCH FORECASTS ARE MADE BASED ON CONSERVATION STATUS ASSESSMENTS PRODUCED BY THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE (IUCN). HOWEVER, WHEN RESEARCHERS APPLY THESE IUCN CONSERVATION STATUS DATA FOR PREDICTING FUTURE EXTINCTIONS, IMPORTANT INFORMATION IS OFTEN OMITTED, WHICH CAN IMPACT THE ACCURACY OF THESE PREDICTIONS. HERE WE PRESENT A NEW APPROACH AND A SOFTWARE FOR SIMULATING FUTURE EXTINCTIONS BASED ON IUCN CONSERVATION STATUS INFORMATION, WHICH INCORPORATES GENERATION LENGTH INFORMATION OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES WHEN MODELING EXTINCTION RISKS. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPLICITLY MODEL FUTURE CHANGES IN CONSERVATION STATUS FOR EACH SPECIES, BASED ON STATUS TRANSITION RATES THAT WE ESTIMATE FROM THE IUCN ASSESSMENT HISTORY OF THE LAST DECADES. FINALLY, WE APPLY A MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO ALGORITHM TO ESTIMATE EXTINCTION RATES FOR EACH SPECIES, BASED ON THE SIMULATED FUTURE EXTINCTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES INHERENTLY INCORPORATE THE CHANCES OF CONSERVATION STATUS CHANGES AND THE GENERATION LENGTH FOR EACH GIVEN SPECIES AND ARE SPECIFIC TO THE SIMULATED TIME FRAME. WE DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF OUR APPROACH BY ESTIMATING FUTURE EXTINCTION RATES FOR ALL BIRD SPECIES. OUR AVERAGE EXTINCTION RATE ESTIMATE FOR THE NEXT 100 YR ACROSS ALL BIRDS IS 6.98 × 10−4 EXTINCTIONS PER SPECIES-YEAR, AND WE PREDICT AN EXPECTED BIODIVERSITY LOSS OF BETWEEN 669 AND 738 BIRD SPECIES WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME. FURTHER, THE RATE ESTIMATES BETWEEN SPECIES SHARING THE SAME IUCN STATUS SHOW LARGER VARIATION THAN THE RATES ESTIMATED WITH ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES, WHICH REFLECTS EXPECTED DIFFERENCES IN EXTINCTION RISK AMONG TAXA OF THE SAME CONSERVATION STATUS. OUR METHOD DEMONSTRATES THE UTILITY OF APPLYING SPECIES-SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO THE ESTIMATION OF EXTINCTION RATES, RATHER THAN ASSUMING EQUAL EXTINCTION RISKS FOR SPECIES ASSIGNED TO THE SAME CONSERVATION STATUS. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

IN PARTICULAR, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS AND DRIVERS OF SPATIAL VARIATION IN LOCAL COMMUNITY DYNAMICS, GENERALIZING TEMPORAL TRENDS FROM DISCRETE LOCATIONS TO ENTIRE LANDSCAPES THAT ARE THE MAIN FOCUS OF MANAGEMENT. HERE, WE PRESENT A FRAMEWORK FOR PRODUCING SPATIALLY CONTINUOUS VIEWS OF COMMUNITY DYNAMICS, FOCUSING ON STREAM FISH AFFECTED BY HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT. LOCATION: RIVER SABOR, NE PORTUGAL. METHODS: WE SAMPLED STREAM FISH AT THIRTY SITES BETWEEN 2012 AND 2019. COMMUNITY TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS WAS USED TO QUANTIFY THE DIRECTIONALITY AND VELOCITY OF COMMUNITY CHANGE, AND THE GEOMETRIC RESEMBLANCE OF COMMUNITY TRAJECTORIES BETWEEN SITES. GEOSTATISTICAL MODELS FOR STREAM NETWORKS WERE USED TO RELATE METRICS DESCRIBING COMMUNITY DYNAMICS TO ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, WHILE CONTROLLING FOR EUCLIDEAN AND HYDROLOGIC SPATIAL DEPENDENCIES, AND TO MAP SPATIAL VARIATION IN COMMUNITY DYNAMICS ACROSS THE WATERSHED. RESULTS: TRAJECTORIES IN MULTIVARIATE SPACE UNDERLINED STRONG TEMPORAL DYNAMICS, WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES DEVIATING AND RETURNING TO PREVIOUS STATES, BUT WITHOUT EVIDENCE FOR DIRECTIONAL CHANGES. ACCORDINGLY, DIRECTIONALITY VALUES WERE LOW AND NOT CONSISTENTLY AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES. THE VELOCITY OF COMMUNITY CHANGE VARIED MARKEDLY ACROSS THE WATERSHED AND IT WAS STRONGLY AFFECTED BY STREAM ORDER AND ELEVATION, WITH FASTER CHANGES OBSERVED IN LOWLAND STREAMS DRAINING INTO HYDROELECTRIC RESERVOIRS AND WITH A HIGH PROPORTION OF EXOTIC SPECIES. PAIRWISE DISTANCES BETWEEN COMMUNITY TRAJECTORIES WERE STRONGLY RELATED TO HYDROLOGIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL DISTANCES BETWEEN SITES. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: LOCAL STREAM FISH COMMUNITIES WERE IN A LOOSE EQUILIBRIUM ACROSS THE WATERSHED, BUT THEY FLUCTUATED AT A FASTER RATE CLOSER TO A HYDROELECTRIC RESERVOIR. INTEGRATING COMMUNITY TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS AND GEOSTATISTICAL MODELLING PROVIDES A RELATIVELY SIMPLE FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND HOW, WHERE AND WHY TEMPORAL COMMUNITY DYNAMICS VARY ACROSS DENDRITIC STREAM NETWORKS AND TO VISUALIZE SPATIAL PATTERNS OF COMMUNITY CHANGE OVER TIME IN RELATION TO ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

HERE, WE FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CTENOMYS IMPLICATIONS TO WILD-LIFE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGY RATHER THAN ITS CLASSICAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL VIEW AS A SUBSISTENCE RESOURCE. THE PRIMARY AIM WAS TO PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE RECENT PAST BIOGEOGRAPHY OF CTENOMYS THAT MAY NOT BE EVIDENT FROM MODERN FAUNA SURVEYS. FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF A HIGHLY SPECIALISED FOSSORIAL RODENT EXTINCT AT THE END OF THE HOLOCENE, THE STUDY POINTS OUT THE EXTREME FRAGILITY OF THE SIERRAS OF CÓRDOBA HIGH MOUNTAIN ENVIRONMENTS UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE AND ANTHROPOGENIC THREAT, DRAWING ON DATA THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THOSE WHO MAKE DECISIONS AND WRITE GUIDELINES FOR WILD-LIFE MANAGEMENT. THE ANALYSIS OF THE CTENOMYS ASSEMBLAGE FROM QUEBRADA DEL REAL 1 REVEALED INFORMATION RELATED TO THE MANAGEMENT, CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF THE MOUNTAIN TOP ENVIRONMENTS THAT CANNOT BE IGNORED BY CONSERVATION BIOLOGISTS AND WILD-LIFE MANAGERS, MOREOVER WHEN THE CAUSES THAT LEAD TO THE EXTINCTION OF C. VIARAPAENSIS ARE THE SAME ONES AFFECTING TO MODERN PLANT AND ANIMAL COMMUNITIES. THE ZOOARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD REFLECTS PAST CONDITIONS TO ASSESS PREINDUSTRIAL ECOLOGICAL STATES OF THE UPPER MOUNTAIN GRASSLAND RANGE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN KNOWN AS A BASELINE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT. THUS, APPLIED ZOOARCHAEOLOGY TO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY REQUIRES FURTHER EXPLORATION AT SIERRAS OF CÓRDOBA IN ORDER TO PRODUCE ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE HIGH-ALTITUDE ECOSYSTEMS FUNCTION, FRAGILITY AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS, WHICH IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT AND IMPROVE THE FUTURE OF THREE MILLION PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON THE ECOLOGICAL SERVICES FROM THESE ENVIRONMENTS. © 2020 ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA",NA,NA,AUECF,"MEDINA, M.E.; UNIDAD DE INVESTIGACIÓN ANEXA AL MUSEO, LABORATORY 102, AV. 60 AND 122, ARGENTINA; EMAIL: PALEOMEDINA@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1111/aec.12967,"CONSEJO NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTÍFICAS Y TÉCNICASCONSEJO NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTÍFICAS Y TÉCNICAS, CONICET, PIP 112‐200801‐02678 AGENCIA NACIONAL DE PROMOCIÓN CIENTÍFICA Y TECNOLÓGICAAGENCIA NACIONAL DE PROMOCIÓN CIENTÍFICA Y TECNOLÓGICA, ANPCYT, PICT 2016‐2881 UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DE LA PLATAUNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DE LA PLATA, UNLP, 11/N885",14429985,AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,2,1,139-147,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,NA,SCOPUS,"FOSSORIAL RODENTS AND APPLIED ZOOARCHAEOLOGY TO ECOSYSTEM CONSERVATION IN SIERRAS OF CÓRDOBA, ARGENTINA",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096755752&doi=10.1111%2faec.12967&partnerID=40&md5=2a4391c270fc5738c9ea1f25ccf31924,46,2021,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE CONSEJO NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTÍFICAS Y TÉCNICAS (PIP 112‐200801‐02678); SECRETARÍA DE CIENCIA Y TÉCNICA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DE LA PLATA (11/N885); AND THE AGENCIA NACIONAL DE PROMOCIÓN CIENTÍFICA Y TECNOLÓGICA (PICT 2016‐2881).

FOR THIS PURPOSE, DATA FROM THE FARMLAND BIRD MONITORING SCHEME IN SLOVENIA AND HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION DATA FROM THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL DATABASES IN THE PERIOD 2008–2019 WERE ANALYSED WITH THE BOOSTED REGRESSION TREES (BRT). THE DIVERSITY OF FARMLAND BIRDS WAS FOUND TO BE HIGHEST IN OPEN, DIVERSELY CROPPED AND EXTENSIVELY TO MODERATELY INTENSIVELY MANAGED LANDSCAPES IN NATURA 2000 SITES WHERE FARM HOLDINGS WERE ALLOCATED A LOW AVERAGE AMOUNT OF BOTH DIRECT PAYMENTS AND PAYMENTS FOR AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES (AEM) AND ORGANIC FARMING (OF). FURTHERMORE, THE HIGHEST DIVERSITY OF THE SUBGROUP OF GRASSLAND SPECIALISTS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VERY OPEN AND EXTENSIVELY MANAGED GRASSLAND LANDSCAPES WITH LOW STOCKING DENSITY (<0.7 LU/HA). BY CONTRAST, THE DIVERSITY OF HABITAT GENERALISTS WAS HIGHEST IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES WITH A HIGH DIVERSITY OF LAND-USE TYPES, MEASURED AT THE BROADER SPATIAL SCALE. AREAS WITH A HIGHER ALLOCATION OF DIRECT PAYMENTS AND PAYMENTS FOR AEM AND OF WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER FARMLAND BIRD DIVERSITY, WHEREAS HIGH DIVERSITY WAS FOUND IN NATURA 2000 SITES AND IN SOME AREAS WITH NATURAL CONSTRAINTS (LFA). AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES AND THE “GREENING” MEASURES HAD A NEGLIGIBLE RELATIVE INFLUENCE ON BIRD DIVERSITY, POSSIBLY DUE TO INEFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION AND LOW UPTAKE BY BENEFICIARIES. THE INTENSIFICATION OF PRODUCTION, PARTICULARLY IN THE BEEF AND DAIRY SECTORS, WHICH HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY DIRECT PAYMENTS, AND FOREST SUCCESSION IN MARGINAL AREAS WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE POTENTIAL KEY DRIVERS OF THE RECENT FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN SLOVENIA. THE FUTURE CAP INCOME SUPPORT SCHEMES SHOULD BE REDESIGNED TO ENSURE AT LEAST NEUTRAL IF NOT POSITIVE OVERALL EFFECTS ON FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY BY GRADUAL PHASING-OUT OF REFERENCES TO (HISTORIC) PRODUCTION LEVELS, INCREASED CONDITIONALITY AND MORE EFFECTIVE VOLUNTARY AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES. © 2020 THE AUTHOR(S)",107200,NA,AEEND,"ŠUMRADA, T.; UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA, JAMNIKARJEVA ULICA 101, SLOVENIA; EMAIL: TANJA.SUMRADA@BF.UNI-LJ.SI",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.agee.2020.107200,"2330-16-310015 JAVNA AGENCIJA ZA RAZISKOVALNO DEJAVNOST RSJAVNA AGENCIJA ZA RAZISKOVALNO DEJAVNOST RS, ARRS, P4-0022",1678809,"AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT",ENGLISH,NA,NA,7,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,DO THE EU'S COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY FUNDS NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE DIVERSITY OF FARMLAND BIRDS?

HOWEVER, STUDIES OF FOREST BIODIVERSITY RESPONSES TO DISTURBANCE TYPICALLY ANALYZE IMMEDIATE OR SHORT-TERM IMPACTS ONLY, WHILE STUDIES RELATING LONG-TERM DISTURBANCE HISTORY TO BIODIVERSITY ASSEMBLAGE DYNAMICS ARE RARE. TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE GAP, WE USED A DENDROECOLOGICAL APPROACH TO LINK NATURAL DISTURBANCE HISTORY OF 250 YEARS (1750–2000) TO STRUCTURAL HABITAT ELEMENTS AND, IN TURN, TO BREEDING BIRD ASSEMBLAGES. WE USED DATA COLLECTED IN 2017 AND 2018 FROM 58 PERMANENT STUDY PLOTS WITHIN 10 PRIMARY SPRUCE FOREST STANDS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE WESTERN CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS OF EUROPE. THIS DATASET CONTAINED BREEDING BIRD COUNTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES DESCRIBING FOREST DENSITY, TREE DIAMETER DISTRIBUTION, TREE HEIGHT, TREE MICROHABITATS, DEADWOOD QUANTITY AND QUALITY, AND REGENERATION. BIRD ASSEMBLAGES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY FOREST STRUCTURE WHICH WAS IN TURN SHAPED BY DISTURBANCE DYNAMICS (DISTURBANCE FREQUENCY, TIME SINCE THE LAST DISTURBANCE AND ITS SEVERITY). EARLY SUCCESSIONAL SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH MORE OPEN HABITATS WERE POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BY DISTURBANCE-RELATED STRUCTURE (I.E. DEADWOOD-RELATED VARIABLES, CANOPY COVER), WHILE SOME SPECIES RESPONDED NEGATIVELY. AT THE SAME TIME, OVERALL ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS AND SHANNON DIVERSITY OF THE BIRD ASSEMBLAGE REMAINED UNCHANGED UNDER VARIABLE DISTURBANCE HISTORIES. OUR RESULTS SUPPORT A VIEW OF PRIMARY SPRUCE FORESTS AS A HIGHLY DYNAMIC ECOSYSTEM, HARBOURING POPULATIONS OF BIRD SPECIES AT ALL STAGES OF SUCCESSION DESPITE SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL CHANGES AND SHIFTING PATCH MOSAICS OVER TIME DUE TO NATURAL DISTURBANCES. © 2020 ELSEVIER B.V.",118647,NA,FECMD,"KAMENIAR, O.; CZECH UNIVERSITY OF LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE, KAMÝCKÁ 129, PRAHA 6 – SUCHDOL 16521, CZECH REPUBLIC; EMAIL: KAMENIAR@FLD.CZU.CZ",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118647,"CIGA/20154316, I GA A/14_/17, IGA A/19/18 CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803, LTC17055, LTT20016 EUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDEUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND, ERDF, ITMS 313011 T721",3781127,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,NA,NA,7,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,HISTORICAL NATURAL DISTURBANCES SHAPE SPRUCE PRIMARY FOREST STRUCTURE AND INDIRECTLY INFLUENCE BIRD ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094325578&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2020.118647&partnerID=40&md5=359b4b9c8c2424aab63717c1014060a9,481,2021,"THIS PROJECT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE INSTITUTIONAL PROJECTS THROUGH THE CZECH UNIVERSITY OF LIFE SCIENCES (GRANT I GA A/14_/17 , IGA A/19/18 AND CIGA/20154316 ) AND THROUGH MINISTRY OF EDUCATION YOUTH AND SPORTS OF CZECH REPUBLIC ( LTC17055 , LTT20016 AND EVA 4.0 PROJECT: CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803).

THIS CAN OFFER SEVERAL BENEFITS OVER TRADITIONAL MONITORING PRACTICES AS IT IS A COST-EFFECTIVE, LARGE-SCALE APPROACH CAPABLE OF PROVIDING LONG TIME SERIES DATA AND RAISING PUBLIC ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS. WHILST THERE IS A DEBATE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF CITIZEN SCIENCE DATA, A STANDARDISED SAMPLING DESIGN CAN ALLOW CITIZEN SCIENCE DATA TO BE OF A SIMILAR QUALITY TO THOSE COLLECTED BY PROFESSIONALS. HOWEVER, MANY PROGRAMMES USE SUBJECTIVE, OPPORTUNISTIC SELECTION OF MONITORING SITES AND THIS INTRODUCES SEVERAL TYPES OF BIAS, WHICH ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. USING BAT ROOST COUNTS AS A CASE STUDY, WE TOOK A ‘VIRTUAL ECOLOGIST’ APPROACH TO SIMULATE THE EFFECT OF OPPORTUNISTIC SITE SELECTION AND UNEVEN OBSERVER RETENTION ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY DETECT ABUNDANCE TRENDS. WE SIMULATED POPULATIONS WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TEMPORAL VARIABILITY AND SITE FIDELITY. OUR SIMULATIONS REVEAL THAT OPPORTUNISTIC SITE SELECTION AND LOW OBSERVER RETENTION CAN RESULT IN BIASED TRENDS AND THAT THESE BIASES ARE MAGNIFIED WHEN MONITORED POPULATIONS EXHIBIT HIGH LEVELS OF INTER-ANNUAL VARIATION AND LOW SITE FIDELITY. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS OF OBSERVER BEHAVIOUR, SITE SELECTION, AND POPULATION DYNAMICS LEAD TO BIASED ABUNDANCE TRENDS IN MONITORING PROGRAMMES. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE VALUE OF ENGAGING AND RETAINING CITIZEN SCIENCE OBSERVERS, A STANDARDISED SAMPLING DESIGN, AND THE COLLECTION OF METADATA. WE CONCLUDE THAT MONITORING PROGRAMMES NEED TO BE AWARE OF THEIR FOCAL SPECIES' TEMPORAL VARIABILITY AND SITE FIDELITY TO ADEQUATELY ASSESS THE POTENTIAL BIAS CAUSED BY OPPORTUNISTIC SITE SELECTION AND LOW OBSERVER RETENTION. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. ACCURATE DATA ON POPULATION CHANGES ARE KEY FOR CONSERVATION SUCCESS. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT CITIZEN SCIENCE MONITORING PROGRAMMES ASSESS AND POTENTIALLY QUANTIFY THE BIASES PRESENT IN THEIR DATA. WE DEMONSTRATE THE APPLICABILITY OF AN ESTABLISHED SIMULATION FRAMEWORK TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF BIASES ON OUR ABILITY TO CORRECTLY DETECT ABUNDANCE TRENDS.

WE GENERATED SIMULATED DATA BY CONSIDERING A BIRTH-DEATH PROCESS IN WHICH LESS ABUNDANT SPECIES WERE MORE LIKELY TO GO EXTINCT. WHEN DETECTION RATES WERE HIGHER FOR COMMON SPECIES, THE 2 MODELS UNDERESTIMATED THE TRUE NUMBER OF UNDETECTED EXTINCTIONS BY UP TO 88.7%, AND WHEN DETECTION RATES WERE INDEPENDENT OF ABUNDANCE, THE 2 MODELS PERFORMED BETTER; THE SEUX MODEL HAD AN AVERAGE BIAS OF +3.1% AND THE TEDESCO MODEL HAD AN AVERAGE BIAS OF −62.3%. WE APPLIED THE MODELS TO 8 REAL-WORLD DATA SETS (E.G., AUSTRALIAN AMPHIBIANS, AUSTRALIAN BIRDS, NORTH AMERICAN BIVALVES) AND FOUND THAT TRUE EXTINCTIONS MAY BE FROM 15% TO 180% HIGHER THAN OBSERVED VALUES. FOR 6 OF THE 8 DATA SETS, THE SEUX MODEL YIELDED ABSOLUTE ESTIMATES THAT WERE 5.7–66.8% LOWER THAN THOSE OF THE TEDESCO MODEL. WE MAINLY ATTRIBUTED THIS DIFFERENCE TO THE SEUX MODEL'S ASSUMPTION THAT THERE ARE NO UNDETECTED EXTANT SPECIES CURRENTLY. WE ASSESSED THE ACCURACY OF THE MODELS’ ESTIMATES WITH A LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO TEST WHETHER DETECTION AND EXTINCTION RATES WERE UNCORRELATED ACROSS SPECIES. RATES WERE CORRELATED FOR 3 OF THE 8 DATA SETS; SPECIES DISCOVERED LATER HAD A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF BEING EXTINCT, SUGGESTING THAT EXTINCTION NUMBERS COULD BE EVEN HIGHER FOR THESE GROUPS.

BIOL.,0,"ILLEGAL TRANSFER OF WILDLIFE HAS 2 MAIN PURPOSES: TRADE AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. TRADE IS THE MOST COMMON, WHEREAS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IS MUCH LESS COMMON AND UNPROFITABLE, YET STILL IMPORTANT. BIOPIRACY IN SCIENCE IS OFTEN NEGLECTED DESPITE THAT MANY RESEARCHERS ENCOUNTER IT DURING THEIR CAREERS. THE USE OF ILLEGALLY ACQUIRED SPECIMENS IS DETECTED IN DIFFERENT RESEARCH FIELDS, FROM SCIENTISTS BIOPROSPECTING FOR NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL SUBSTANCES, TO TAXONOMISTS WORKING ON NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS, TO RESEARCHERS WORKING IN ZOOS, AQUARIUMS, AND BOTANICAL GARDENS. THE PRACTICE CAN BE DUE TO A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OR, PROBABLY MOST OFTEN, TO THE GENERALLY HIGH LEVEL OF BUREAUCRACY ASSOCIATED WITH RULE COMPLIANCE. SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY FILTERS TO AVOID BIOPIRACY CAN BE PROVIDED BY DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTION HOSTS SHOULD ADOPT STRICT CODES OF CONDUCT; EDITORS OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS SHOULD REQUIRE AUTHORS TO DECLARE THAT ALL STUDIED SPECIMENS WERE ACQUIRED LEGALLY AND TO CITE MUSEUM CATALOG NUMBERS AS GUARANTEE OF BEST PRACTICES. SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES SHOULD ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE PUBLICATION IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS OF WORK IN WHICH SPECIMENS COLLECTED FROM THE WILD WERE USED. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE COULD REQUIRE NEWLY DESIGNATED TYPES BASED ON RECENTLY COLLECTED SPECIMENS TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY STATEMENTS OF DEPOSITION IN RECOGNIZED SCIENTIFIC OR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. WE ALSO PROPOSE THE CREATION OF AN ONLINE PLATFORM THAT GATHERS INFORMATION ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND PERMITS REQUIRED FOR SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND THE SIMPLIFICATION OF THE BUREAUCRACY RELATED TO REGULATING SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES. THIS WOULD MAKE REGULATIONS MORE AGILE AND EASIER TO COMPLY WITH. THE GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY CRISIS MEANS DATA NEED TO BE COLLECTED EVER FASTER, BUT BIOPIRACY IS NOT THE ANSWER AND UNDERMINES THE CREDIBILITY OF SCIENCE AND RESEARCHERS. IT IS CRITICAL TO FIND A MODUS VIVENDI THAT PROMOTES COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS AND SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

TO INFORM DECISION-MAKERS OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION ACTIONS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY BIASES AND GAPS IN THE CONSERVATION LITERATURE TO PRIORITIZE FUTURE EVIDENCE GENERATION. WE USED THE CONSERVATION EVIDENCE DATABASE TO ASSESS THE STATE OF THE GLOBAL LITERATURE THAT TESTS CONSERVATION ACTIONS FOR AMPHIBIANS AND BIRDS. FOR THE STUDIES IN THE DATABASE, WE INVESTIGATED THEIR SPATIAL AND TAXONOMIC EXTENT AND DISTRIBUTION ACROSS BIOMES, EFFECTIVENESS METRICS, AND STUDY DESIGNS. STUDIES WERE HEAVILY CONCENTRATED IN WESTERN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA FOR BIRDS AND PARTICULARLY FOR AMPHIBIANS, AND TEMPERATE FOREST AND GRASSLAND BIOMES WERE HIGHLY REPRESENTED RELATIVE TO THEIR PERCENTAGE OF LAND COVERAGE. STUDIES THAT USED THE MOST RELIABLE STUDY DESIGNS—BEFORE-AFTER CONTROL-IMPACT AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS—WERE THE MOST GEOGRAPHICALLY RESTRICTED AND SCARCE IN THE EVIDENCE BASE. THERE WERE NEGATIVE SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE NUMBERS OF STUDIES AND THE NUMBERS OF THREATENED AND DATA-DEFICIENT SPECIES WORLDWIDE. TAXONOMIC BIASES AND GAPS WERE APPARENT FOR AMPHIBIANS AND BIRDS—SOME ENTIRE ORDERS WERE ABSENT FROM THE EVIDENCE BASE—WHEREAS OTHERS WERE POORLY REPRESENTED RELATIVE TO THE PROPORTION OF THREATENED SPECIES THEY CONTAINED. METRICS USED TO EVALUATE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONSERVATION ACTIONS WERE OFTEN INCONSISTENT BETWEEN STUDIES, POTENTIALLY MAKING THEM LESS DIRECTLY COMPARABLE AND EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS MORE DIFFICULT. TESTING CONSERVATION ACTIONS ON THREATENED SPECIES OUTSIDE WESTERN EUROPE, NORTH AMERICA, AND AUSTRALASIA SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED. STANDARDIZING METRICS AND IMPROVING THE RIGOR OF STUDY DESIGNS USED TO TEST CONSERVATION ACTIONS WOULD ALSO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR SYNTHESIS AND DECISION-MAKING. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

OUR AIM WAS TO INVESTIGATE HOW URBANIZATION SHAPES SPECIES RICHNESS (SR) AND COMPOSITION OF ANURAN COMMUNITIES IN NW ARGENTINA, AND TO DETERMINE WHICH SUITE OF LIFE HISTORY TRAITS ARE RELATED TO ANURAN TOLERANCE TO URBAN DEVELOPMENT. WE CLASSIFIED ANURAN SPECIES IN FUNCTIONAL GROUPS (FG) BASED ON A SERIES OF ECOLOGICAL TRAITS AND RECOGNIZED THEM AS URBAN-TOLERANT OR URBAN-AVOIDERS. WE CONSTRUCTED AN URBANIZATION COMPOSITE INDEX (UI) THROUGH AN EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS BASED ON MEASURES OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT INTENSITY, NOISE POLLUTION, LAND USE TYPES, AND MEAN VALUES OF LTS, NDMI, AND NDVI. WE TESTED THE RESPONSE OF SR, FG AND SPECIES OCCURRENCE TO UI WITH GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS AND A VARIATION PARTITIONING ANALYSIS. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THE NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF URBANIZATION ON ANURAN DIVERSITY AND SUGGESTED THAT THE LOSS OF ANURAN SPECIES IS NOT RANDOM, POINTING TO THE PRESENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERS. ONLY TERRESTRIAL FROGS THAT BUILD AQUATIC FOAM NESTS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY AN INCREASE IN URBANIZATION, SO THEY MAY BE CONSIDERED AS URBAN--TOLERANT. FURTHER, OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF DISPERSAL CAPACITY IN STRUCTURING THE URBAN ANURAN ASSEMBLAGES.

HOWEVER, THEY ARE USUALLY CONFOUNDED, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE FRAGMENTATION EFFECTS FROM THOSE OF HABITAT LOSS. IN ADDITION, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT OFTEN FRAGMENTATION NEGATIVELY AFFECTS BIODIVERSITY ONLY BELOW A CERTAIN THRESHOLD OF HABITAT AMOUNT. WE INVESTIGATED THE SEPARATE AND INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF HABITAT AMOUNT AND FRAGMENTATION ON HABITAT SELECTION OF THE WOODLARK AT 10 SPATIAL SCALES. IN SOUTHERN SWITZERLAND THIS PASSERINE MAINLY BREEDS IN GROUND-VEGETATED VINEYARDS, WHICH THEREFORE REPRESENT THE FOCAL HABITAT TYPE IN THIS STUDY. ADDITIONALLY, WE INVESTIGATED LAND COVER, TOPOGRAPHIC AND CLIMATIC VARIABLES AT THE SAME 10 SCALES TO OBTAIN A HOLISTIC PICTURE OF SPECIES-HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS. HABITAT SELECTION WAS ANALYZED AT TWO HIERARCHICAL LEVELS: HOME RANGE SELECTION WITHIN THE STUDY AREA AND HABITAT USE WITHIN HOME RANGES. HOME RANGE SELECTION WAS STRONGLY DRIVEN BY AN INTERACTIVE EFFECT OF HABITAT AMOUNT AND FRAGMENTATION: WOODLARKS AVOIDED FRAGMENTED AREAS IF HABITAT AMOUNT WAS BELOW 20% BUT EXHIBITED A PREFERENCE FOR FRAGMENTED AREAS IF HABITAT AMOUNT EXCEEDED THIS THRESHOLD. BOTH HABITAT AMOUNT AND FRAGMENTATION MOST STRONGLY AFFECTED HABITAT USE AT THE 100 M SCALE. WE DID NOT FIND SUCH INTERACTIVE EFFECTS FOR HABITAT USE WITHIN HOME RANGES. AT THIS LEVEL, HABITAT AMOUNT AT A 50 M SCALE INFLUENCED WOODLARK PRESENCE POSITIVELY WITH NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF FRAGMENTATION. FURTHERMORE, WOODLARKS PREFERRED EVENLY SLOPED LANDSCAPE MOSAICS INTERSPERSED WITH STEPPES AND GROVES. TWO MAIN INSIGHTS EMERGE FROM OUR STUDY. FIRST, THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE NECESSITY OF STUDYING SCALE EXPLICIT AND INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF HABITAT AMOUNT AND FRAGMENTATION WHEN ADDRESSING ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS, SUCH AS HABITAT SELECTION IN BIRDS. SECOND, WE PROVIDE MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FARMERS: MORE VINEYARDS SHOULD BE VEGETATED AND ARRANGED AS DISJUNCT PATCHES WHERE THEIR SURFACE COVERS MORE THAN 20% OF THE LANDSCAPE BUT BE AGGREGATED WHERE VEGETATED AREA IS LOWER. © 2020 THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON",NA,NA,NA,"BOSCO, L.; DIVISION OF CONSERVATION BIOLOGY, SWITZERLAND; EMAIL: LAURA-BOSCO@HOTMAIL.COM; BOSCO, L.; SWISS ORNITHOLOGICAL INSTITUTESWITZERLAND; EMAIL: LAURA-BOSCO@HOTMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1111/acv.12604,"SCHWEIZERISCHER NATIONALFONDS ZUR FÖRDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTLICHEN FORSCHUNGSCHWEIZERISCHER NATIONALFONDS ZUR FÖRDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTLICHEN FORSCHUNG, SNF, 31003A_149780",13679430,ANIMAL CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,5,1,84-94,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,NA,SCOPUS,FRAGMENTATION EFFECTS ON WOODLARK HABITAT SELECTION DEPEND ON HABITAT AMOUNT AND SPATIAL SCALE,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085889470&doi=10.1111%2facv.12604&partnerID=40&md5=3de3165c5e7e7245a32c37e3b966c36c,24,2021,"THE AUTHORS THANK ALL THE GRAPE GROWERS FOR FREE ACCESS TO THEIR GROUNDS AS WELL AS THE REGIONAL VITIVAL (VALAIS ASSOCIATION FOR VITICULTURE) GROUPS FOR THEIR COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT.

IN NORTH AMERICA, ONE OF THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF HABITAT MODIFICATION OVER THE LAST 2 DECADES HAS BEEN EXPLORATION FOR AND PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS (HYDROCARBON DEVELOPMENT), WHICH HAS LED TO DEMOGRAPHIC AND BEHAVIORAL IMPACTS TO NUMEROUS WILDLIFE SPECIES. DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO MITIGATE THESE IMPACTS HAS BECOME A CRITICAL TASK FOR WILDLIFE MANAGERS AND CONSERVATION PRACTITIONERS. HOWEVER, THIS TASK HAS BEEN HINDERED BY THE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN IDENTIFYING AND ISOLATING FACTORS DRIVING POPULATION RESPONSES. CURRENT RESEARCH ON RESPONSES OF WILDLIFE TO DEVELOPMENT PREDOMINANTLY QUANTIFIES BEHAVIOR, BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS CLEAR HOW THESE RESPONSES SCALE TO DEMOGRAPHY AND POPULATION DYNAMICS. CONCOMITANT ASSESSMENTS OF BEHAVIOR AND POPULATION-LEVEL PROCESSES ARE NEEDED TO GAIN THE MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING REQUIRED TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE MITIGATION APPROACHES. WE SIMULTANEOUSLY ASSESSED THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES OF A MULE DEER POPULATION TO NATURAL GAS DEVELOPMENT ON WINTER RANGE IN THE PICEANCE BASIN OF COLORADO, USA, FROM 2008 TO 2015. NOTABLY, THIS WAS THE PERIOD WHEN DEVELOPMENT DECLINED FROM HIGH LEVELS OF ACTIVE DRILLING TO ONLY PRODUCTION PHASE ACTIVITY (I.E., NO DRILLING). WE FOCUSED OUR DATA COLLECTION ON 2 CONTIGUOUS MULE DEER WINTER RANGE STUDY AREAS THAT EXPERIENCED STARKLY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF HYDROCARBON DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE PICEANCE BASIN. WE ASSESSED MULE DEER BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES TO A RANGE OF DEVELOPMENT FEATURES WITH VARYING LEVELS OF ASSOCIATED HUMAN ACTIVITY BY EXAMINING HABITAT SELECTION PATTERNS OF NEARLY 400 INDIVIDUAL ADULT FEMALE MULE DEER. CONCURRENTLY, WE ASSESSED THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF NATURAL GAS DEVELOPMENT BY COMPARING ANNUAL ADULT FEMALE AND OVERWINTER FAWN (6-MONTH-OLD ANIMALS) SURVIVAL, DECEMBER FAWN MASS, ADULT FEMALE LATE AND EARLY WINTER BODY FAT, AGE, PREGNANCY RATES, FETAL COUNTS, AND LACTATION RATES IN DECEMBER BETWEEN THE 2 STUDY AREAS. STRONG DIFFERENCES IN HABITAT SELECTION BETWEEN THE 2 STUDY AREAS WERE APPARENT. DEER IN THE LESS-DEVELOPED STUDY AREA AVOIDED DEVELOPMENT DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT, AND SELECTED HABITAT PRESUMED TO BE USED FOR FORAGING. DEER IN THE HEAVILY DEVELOPED STUDY AREA SELECTED HABITAT PRESUMED TO BE USED FOR THERMAL AND SECURITY COVER TO A GREATER DEGREE. DEER FACED WITH HIGHER DENSITIES OF DEVELOPMENT AVOIDED AREAS WITH MORE WELL PADS DURING THE DAY AND RESPONDED NEUTRALLY OR SELECTED FOR THESE AREAS AT NIGHT. DEER IN BOTH STUDY AREAS SHOWED A STRONG REDUCTION IN USE OF AREAS AROUND WELL PADS THAT WERE BEING DRILLED, WHICH IS THE PHASE OF ENERGY DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF HUMAN PRESENCE, VEHICLE TRAFFIC, NOISE, AND ARTIFICIAL LIGHT. DESPITE DIVERGENT HABITAT SELECTION PATTERNS, WE FOUND NO EFFECTS OF DEVELOPMENT ON INDIVIDUAL CONDITION OR REPRODUCTION AND FOUND NO DIFFERENCES IN ANY OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL OR VITAL RATE PARAMETERS MEASURED AT THE POPULATION LEVEL. HOWEVER, DEER DENSITY AND ANNUAL INCREASES IN DENSITY WERE HIGHER IN THE LOW-DEVELOPMENT AREA. THUS, THE RECORDED BEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH DEMOGRAPHIC OR PHYSIOLOGICAL COSTS MEASURED AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, POSSIBLY BECAUSE POPULATIONS ARE BELOW WINTER RANGE CARRYING CAPACITY. DIFFERENCES IN POPULATION DENSITY BETWEEN THE 2 AREAS MAY BE A RESULT OF A POPULATION DECLINE PRIOR TO OUR STUDY (WHEN DEVELOPMENT WAS INITIATED) OR AREA-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN HABITAT QUALITY, JUVENILE DISPERSAL, OR NEONATAL OR JUVENILE SURVIVAL; HOWEVER, WE LACK THE REQUIRED DATA TO CONTRAST EVIDENCE FOR THESE MECHANISMS. GIVEN OUR RESULTS, IT APPEARS THAT DEER CAN ADJUST TO RELATIVELY HIGH DENSITIES OF WELL PADS IN THE PRODUCTION PHASE (THE PERIOD WITH MARKEDLY LOWER HUMAN ACTIVITY ON THE LANDSCAPE), PROVIDED THERE IS SUFFICIENT VEGETATIVE AND TOPOGRAPHIC COVER AFFORDED TO THEM AND POPULATIONS ARE BELOW CARRYING CAPACITY. THE STRONG REACTION TO WELLS IN THE DRILLING PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT SUGGESTS MITIGATION EFFORTS SHOULD FOCUS ON THIS ACTIVITY AND STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT. MANY OF THE WELLS IN THIS AREA WERE DIRECTIONALLY DRILLED FROM MULTIPLE-WELL PADS, LEADING TO A REDUCED FOOTPRINT OF DISTURBANCE, BUT WERE STILL RELATED TO STRONG BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES. OUR RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THE LIKELY VALUE OF MITIGATION EFFORTS FOCUSING ON REDUCING HUMAN ACTIVITY (I.E., VEHICLE TRAFFIC, LIGHT, AND NOISE). IN COMBINATION, THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO THE SPATIAL CONFIGURATION OF THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT FOOTPRINT TO ENSURE ADEQUATE COVER. IN OUR STUDY SYSTEM, MINIMIZING THE ROAD NETWORK THROUGH LANDSCAPE-LEVEL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING WOULD BE VALUABLE (I.E., EXPLORING A MAXIMUM ROAD DENSITY CRITERIA).

IN THIS REVIEW ARTICLE, WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CAUCALIDION IN GERMANY, ITS SPECIES COMPOSITION, LIFE CYCLE AND BIODIVERSITY, DISTRIBUTION, HABITAT AND PHYTOSOCIOLOGICAL VARIATION, ITS HISTORY, REASONS OF DECLINE, AND CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT BOTH AT PRESENT AND IN VIEW OF FUTURE OPTIONS. THE CAUCALIDION IS A WELL-DEFINED ALLIANCE CHARACTERIZED BY MORE THAN 50 PLANT SPECIES IN GERMANY ALONE, ALAS A MAJORITY OF THEM IS NOW SCARCE AND LISTED IN THE NATIONAL RED DATA BOOK. CAUCALIDION VEGETATION HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH GRAIN FARMING SINCE AS EARLY AS THE BRONZE AGE, ALTHOUGH ITS SPECIES COMPOSITION HAS ALTERED OVER TIME DUE TO CHANGES IN CROP SPECIES, TILLAGE AND FARMING TECHNOLOGY. GENERALLY, THE NUMBER AND PROPORTION OF SEGETAL PLANTS IN GRAIN FIELDS HAS INCREASED. HOWEVER, THE PAST DECADES HAVE SEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED INTENSIFICATION AND INCREASE IN PRODUCTION OF ARABLE FARMING, YET TO THE COST OF SOIL HEALTH, DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF WILDLIFE. MOST CHARACTERISTIC SPECIES OF THE CAUCALIDION ARE ARCHAEOPHYTES, SOME OF WHICH ACCOMPANYING ARABLE FARMING SINCE MILLENNIA, OTHERS SINCE MEDIAEVAL TIMES. HOWEVER, THE PLANT SPECIES POOL TYPICAL OF CALCAREOUS FIELDS IN GERMANY (COMPRISING MORE THAN 150 SPECIES SUFFICIENTLY FREQUENT TO OCCUR IN AT LEAST 10 % OF THE – HISTORICAL – RELEVÉS IN AT LEAST ONE REGION OR COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION) CONSISTS OF AT LEAST 55 % NATIVE PLANT SPECIES. THE CAUCALIDION HAS A EUROPEAN (WARM-)TEMPERATE, SUBOCEANIC TO SUBCONTINENTAL DISTRIBUTION AREA, FROM THE BRITISH ISLES TO SOUTHERN SWEDEN, AND FROM CENTRAL SPAIN TO THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE BLACK SEA. IT IS MAINLY DISTRIBUTED IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPEAN AND SUB-MEDITERRANEAN REGIONS. IN GERMANY, IT OCCURS AT ALL ALTITUDINAL BELTS THAT SUPPORT AGRICULTURE, AND COVERS ALL PRODUCTIVITY CLASSES OF ARABLE SOIL INCLUDING THE TOP HIGH-YIELD SITES. THREE PLANT COMMUNITY TYPES (ASSOCIATIONS) OF THE CAUCALIDION OCCUR IN GERMANY: THE FLUELLEN COMMUNITY (KICKXIETUM SPURIAE) REACHES THE COUNTRY IN THE WEST AND IS FOUND ON THICK CALCAREOUS LOAMS AND CLAYS UNDER SUBOCEANIC CONDITIONS. THE COMMUNITY NAMED AFTER NIGHT-FLOWERING CATCHFLY (EUPHORBIO EXIGUAE-MELANDRIETUM NOCTIFLORI) OCCURS ON DEEP LOESS AND CHERNOZEM AS WELL AS CALCARIC CAMBISOLS MOSTLY IN THE NORTH OF THE CAUCALIDION DISTRIBUTION AREA. FINALLY, THE MORE SOUTHERLY DISTRIBUTED BUR-PARSLEY COMMUNITY (CAUCALIDO PLATYCARPI-CONRINGIETUM ORIENTALIS) DEPENDS ON OFTEN THIN CALCAREOUS CLAY LOAMS UNDER WARMER AND DRIER CONDITIONS. CAUCALIDION VEGETATION IS CURRENTLY ASSOCIATED ALMOST ENTIRELY WITH AUTUMN-SOWN CEREAL VARIETIES, BUT UNTIL IN THE RECENT PAST SPRING-SOWN CEREALS HAVE ALSO BEEN COMMON ON CALCAREOUS FIELDS. THE RHYTHM OF ARABLE PLANT GROWTH DETERMINES THE FOOD RESOURCES ON CULTIVATED LANDS. IN THE CAUCALIDION, AS IN OTHER PLANT COMMUNITIES OF ARABLE FIELDS, ANNUAL PLANTS DOMINATE, COMPRISING A MIXTURE OF LIFE CYCLES INCLUDING AUTUMN-GERMINATING AND SPRINGGERMINATING PLANTS AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT MAY GERMINATE ANYTIME WHEN CONDITIONS ARE FAVOURABLE. HISTORICAL RELEVÉS OF THE 1950S TO 1970S REVEAL MEAN TOTAL COVER VALUES OF ARABLE PLANTS OF 35 TO OVER 40 %, APPROXIMATING THE CROP COVER VALUES. PUBLISHED REFERENCES TO ARABLE WEEDS BY BOTANISTS OF THE 18TH AND 19TH CENTURY HIGHLIGHT THE LOCAL ABUNDANCE OF CAUCALIDION PLANTS INCLUDING SPECIES KNOWN AS BEING EXTREMELY RARE TODAY. THE VARIETY OF ARABLE PLANTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WITH THEIR LEAVES, BUDS, FLOWERS, POLLEN, NECTAR AND SEEDS SATISFIES THE DIETARY NEEDS OF ALL KINDS OF ARABLE WILDLIFE, PROVIDED THAT CEREAL STUBBLES ARE LEFT AFTER HARVEST AS STUBBLE-FIELDS SUPPORT LATE FLOWERING AND FRUITING PLANTS ESSENTIAL FOR SEED-EATING BIRDS AND OTHER FAUNA. POLLINATORS ARE REPRESENTED IN ARABLE FIELDS BY BOTH GENERALISTS AND SPECIALISTS SUCH AS WILD BEES FEEDING EXCLUSIVELY ON SINAPIS ARVENSIS OR CONVOLVULUS ARVENSIS, RESPECTIVELY, BOTH COMMON AND LOCALLY ABUNDANT IN CAUCALIDION FIELDS. THE 19TH AND EARLY 20TH CENTURY LOSSES OF THE ARABLE FLORA WERE DUE TO MORE AND MORE EFFICIENT SEED CLEANING, CHANGES IN CROP ROTATION WITH LOSS OF FALLOW, AND INCREASING MECHANIZATION. THIS PROCESS ACCELERATED TOWARDS THE END OF THE 20TH CENTURY BY REVOLUTIONARY CHANGES IN ARABLE FARMING METHODS, INCLUDING MASSIVE INCREASES IN THE APPLICATION OF AGROCHEMICALS SUCH AS HERBICIDES AND ARTIFICIAL NITROGEN FERTILISER, AND THE LOSS OF CROP STUBBLES IN THE AUTUMN AND WINTER. IN THE PAST DECADES, SPECIES-RICH CAUCALIDION VEGETATION TOGETHER WITH ITS FARMLAND WILDLIFE HAS DRASTICALLY DECLINED TO MOSTLY TINY AREAS EXTANT ONLY IN SCATTERED FIELD MARGINS. CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT OF FIELD MARGIN STRIPS, SET UP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE LATE 1970S IN THE EIFEL MOUNTAINS BY THE INITIATIVE OF WOLFGANG SCHUMACHER, IS NOW SAFEGUARDED BY VARIOUS BIODIVERSITY ACTION PLANS IN THE FEDERAL STATES PROVIDING FINANCIAL COMPENSATION TO CONTRACTUAL FARMERS FOR PRODUCTION LOSSES. DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF PROGRAMMES DEVOTED TO THE CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT OF FIELD MARGIN STRIPS RICH IN CAUCALIDION SPECIES THEIR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT MAY BE BLEAK DUE TO DISCONTINUATION OF THE PROGRAMMES AND COMPENSATORY PAYMENTS, COMPETING – AND EVENTUALLY MORE PROFITABLE – AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES, THE ONGOING ABANDONMENT OF UNPRODUCTIVE FIELDS, AND INCREASINGLY THE USE OF EVEN SUCH FIELDS FOR ENERGY CROP CULTIVATION. RECENT EVIDENCE HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF HABITAT CONTINUITY FOR RARE CAUCALIDION PLANT SPECIES. CHANGES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION’S COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE FUTURE SITUATION OF AGRO-ECOSYSTEMS. CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS AND SUBSEQUENT NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION SHOULD PRIORITIZE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES OF FARMLAND MANAGEMENT AGAINST UNBALANCED CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURE DIRECTED ONLY TO YIELD MAXIMISATION AND INCREASINGLY TO THE PROFITS OF OUTSIDE FARMLAND INVESTORS. ECONOMIC INCENTIVES SHOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARDS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF ORGANIC FARMING AND TO IMPLEMENT A NETWORK OF SITES OF NATURE CONSERVATION IMPORTANCE, ARABLE PLANT SANCTUARIES IN FARMED FIELDS AT THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL, ACROSS AGRICULTURAL REGIONS. THEY REPRESENT FOCUS AREAS FOR THE LOCAL ARABLE WILDLIFE SPECIES POOL AND MAY SERVE AS RESERVOIRS FOR RARE SPECIES SELECTED FOR RE-INTRODUCTION IN SURROUNDING LANDSCAPES WHERE THEY ARE GONE.

UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING BIODIVERSITY LOSS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN RAPIDLY CHANGING AND BIODIVERSITY-RICH AREAS LIKE THE NEOTROPICS AND REQUIRES EXPLORING THE ROLE OF BOTH INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC VULNERABILITY DRIVERS. HERE, WE TEST HOW MULTIPLE POTENTIAL INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC FACTORS EXPLAIN VULNERABILITY TO EXTINCTION IN NEOTROPICAL BIRDS TO PROVIDE A FIRST INSIGHT INTO WHAT MAKES THESE SPECIES SUSCEPTIBLE TO EXTINCTION AND HOW THEY ARE RESPONDING TO ANTHROPIZATION. OUR ANALYSES INCLUDED DATA FOR 2268 NEOTROPICAL BIRDS. WE CHARACTERIZED EXTINCTION RISK BASED ON THE IUCN RED LIST CATEGORIZATION AND TESTED THE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF SEVEN INTRINSIC AND FOUR EXTRINSIC VARIABLES USING BAYESIAN MCMC PHYLOGENETIC GENERALIZED LEAST-SQUARES (PGLS) MODELS. AS HYPOTHESIZED, WE FOUND HIGHER INTRINSIC VULNERABILITY TO EXTINCTION AMONG BIGGER AND MORE SPECIALIZED SPECIES WHICH HAVE LOW REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT AND OCCUPY SMALLER DISTRIBUTION RANGES. EXTRINSIC DRIVERS WERE ALSO RELEVANT PREDICTORS WITH MORE THREATENED SPECIES OVERLAPPING LARGELY AREAS WITH FEWER HUMAN ACTIVITIES (LOWER NIGHT LIGHT LEVELS AND LOWER HUMAN POPULATION DENSITIES). OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EXTINCTION RISK OF NEOTROPICAL BIRDS IS CORRELATED WITH BOTH INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC FACTORS. INTRINSIC VULNERABILITIES WERE AS EXPECTED ASSOCIATED WITH NARROWER, SPECIALIZED NICHES AND SLOWER LIFE HISTORIES. HOWEVER, RISK WAS NOT HIGHER IN MORE HUMANIZED ENVIRONMENTS, BUT INSTEAD MORE AT-RISK SPECIES WERE FOUND IN LESS DISTURBED AREAS THAT WE SUGGEST MAY REPRESENT REFUGES FOR BIRDS THAT PREVIOUSLY OCCURRED IN WIDER RANGES AND HAVE NOW BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE MORE ANTHROPIZED REGIONS.

WE APPLIED STRUCTURED EXPERT ELICITATION TO 26 FROGS ASSESSED AS CRITICALLY ENDANGERED AND ENDANGERED TO ESTIMATE THEIR PROBABILITY OF EXTINCTION BY 2040. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED WHETHER PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCE (MEASURED AS A SELF-ASSIGNED CATEGORICAL SCORE, I.E. 'EXPERT' OR 'NON-EXPERT') INFLUENCED THE ESTIMATES. COLLATION AND ANALYSIS OF PARTICIPANT OPINION INDICATED THAT EIGHT SPECIES ARE AT HIGH RISK (>50% CHANCE) OF BECOMING EXTINCT BY 2040, WITH THE DISEASE CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS IDENTIFIED AS THE PRIMARY THREAT. A FURTHER FIVE SPECIES ARE AT MODERATE-HIGH RISK (30-50% CHANCE), PRIMARILY DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. FOURTEEN OF THE 26 FROG SPECIES ARE ENDEMIC TO QUEENSLAND, WITH MANY SPECIES RESTRICTED TO SMALL GEOGRAPHIC RANGES THAT ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO STOCHASTIC EVENTS (E.G. A SEVERE HEATWAVE OR A LARGE BUSHFIRE). EXPERTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO RATE EXTINCTION PROBABILITY HIGHER FOR POORLY KNOWN SPECIES (THOSE WITH <10 EXPERTS), WHILE NON-EXPERTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO RATE EXTINCTION PROBABILITY HIGHER FOR BETTER-KNOWN SPECIES. HOWEVER, SCORES CONVERGED FOLLOWING DISCUSSION, INDICATING THAT THERE WAS GREATER CONSENSUS IN THE ESTIMATES OF EXTINCTION PROBABILITY. INCREASED RESOURCING AND MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO AVERT FUTURE EXTINCTIONS OF AUSTRALIA'S FROGS.

WE SEEK TO ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URBANIZATION AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF LAKE-DEPENDENT BIRDS IN BANGALORE, A TROPICAL MEGA-CITY IN SOUTHERN INDIA. WE SPECIFICALLY ASK: (I) HOW IS BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS RELATED TO THE SIZE OF THE LAKE? (II) HOW IS BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS IN BANGALORE'S LAKES RELATED TO THE DEGREE OF URBANIZATION? WE USED DATA FROM 2014 TO 2019, COLLECTED FROM EBIRD - AN ONLINE DATABASE THAT COLLATES INFORMATION ON BIRD OBSERVATIONS GLOBALLY. BOTH LAKE AREA AND DISTANCE FROM THE CITY CENTRE ARE CORRELATED TO SPECIES RICHNESS, WITH LARGER LAKES SUPPORTING MORE BIRD SPECIES. AS DISTANCE FROM THE CITY CENTRE INCREASED (I.E. URBANIZATION DECREASES), BIRD RICHNESS INCREASED. OVERALL, IN THE CITY OF BANGALORE, MIGRATORY BIRDS HAVE DECLINED WHILE MANY LAKE-DEPENDENT RESIDENT BIRDS SEEM TO BE INCREASING OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT BIRDS THAT ROOST AND NEST IN TREES APPEAR TO BE INCREASING. TO CONFIRM THIS, FURTHER RESEARCH TAKING A TRAIT-BASED APPROACH IS REQUIRED.

WE RECORDED 60 FISH SPECIES, OF WHICH 16 WERE NATIVE AND 44 NON-NATIVE WITH 19 TRANSLOCATED, AND 25 EXOTIC. THE EXOTICS POECILIA RETICULATA, XIPHOPHORUS MACULATUS, X.

THE CONTAMINATION INDEX SHOWED THAT MOST CREEKS HAD HIGH PROPORTIONAL CONTAMINATION BY EXOTIC SPECIES (ABOVE 60%). BETA DIVERSITY INCREASED FROM HISTORICAL TO CONTEMPORARY PERIODS IN ALL CREEKS DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION AND DIFFERENTIAL COLONIZATION PRESSURE OF SEVERAL NON-NATIVE TRANSLOCATED AND EXOTIC SPECIES, INDICATING BIOTIC DIFFERENTIATION. TEMPERATURE AND NUMBER OF PONDS WERE THE MAIN PREDITORS OF CHANGE IN BETA DIVERSITY IN THE HEADWATER CREEKS DURING THE CONTEMPORARY PERIOD.

THE IMPACTS OF INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES (IAS) ON THE ENVIRONMENT ARE WELL KNOWN, HOWEVER, ECONOMIC IMPACTS ARE POORLY ESTIMATED, ESPECIALLY IN MEGA-DIVERSE COUNTRIES WHERE BOTH ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THESE EFFECTS CAN BE CATASTROPHIC. ECUADOR, ONE OF THE SMALLEST MEGA-DIVERSE COUNTRIES, LACKS A COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE ECONOMIC COSTS OF IAS WITHIN ITS TERRITORY. HERE, USING ""INVACOST"", A PUBLIC DATABASE THAT COMPILES ALL RECORDED MONETARY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IAS FROM ENGLISH AND NON-ENGLISH SOURCES, WE INVESTIGATED THE ECONOMIC COSTS OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS. WE FOUND THAT BETWEEN 1983 AND 2017, THE REPORTED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS RANGED BETWEEN US$86.17 MILLION (WHEN CONSIDERING ONLY THE MOST ROBUST DATA) AND US$626 MILLION (WHEN INCLUDING ALL COST DATA) BELONGING TO 37 SPECIES AND 27 GENERA. FURTHERMORE, 99% OF THE RECORDED COST ENTRIES WERE FROM THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS. FROM ONLY ROBUST DATA, THE COSTLIEST IDENTIFIED TAXONOMIC GROUP WAS FERAL GOATS (CAPRA HIRCUS; US$20 MILLION), FOLLOWED BY AEDES MOSQUITOES (US$2.14 MILLION) WHILE ORGANISMS LIKE PLANT SPECIES FROM THE GENUS RUBUS, A PARASITIC FLY (PHILORNIS DOWNSI), BLACK RATS (RATTUS RATTUS) AND TERRESTRIAL GASTROPODS (ACHATINA FULICA) REPRESENTED LESS THAN US$2 MILLION EACH. COSTS OF ""MIXED-TAXA"" (I.E. PLANTS AND ANIMALS) REPRESENTED THE HIGHEST (61% OF TOTAL ROBUST COSTS; US$52.44 MILLION). THE MOST IMPACTED ACTIVITY SECTOR WAS THE NATIONAL PARK AUTHORITIES, WHICH SPENT ABOUT US$84 MILLION. RESULTS FROM ROBUST DATA ALSO REVEALED THAT MANAGEMENT EXPENDITURES WERE THE MAJOR TYPE OF COSTS RECORDED IN THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS; HOWEVER, COSTS REPORTED FOR MEDICAL LOSSES RELATED TO AEDES MOSQUITOES CAUSING DENGUE FEVER IN MAINLAND ECUADOR WOULD HAVE RANKED FIRST IF MORE DETAILED INFORMATION HAD ALLOWED US TO CATEGORIZE THEM AS ROBUST DATA. OVER 70% OF THE IAS REPORTED FOR ECUADOR DID NOT HAVE REPORTED COSTS.

IN MOST COUNTRIES, AVAILABLE DATA ON MONETARY COSTS OF IAS ARE SCARCE, WHILE BEING CRUCIAL FOR DEVELOPING EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE USE AVAILABLE DATA COLLECTED FROM THE FIRST GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF ECONOMIC COSTS OF IAS (INVACOST) TO QUANTIFY AND DESCRIBE THE ECONOMIC COST OF INVASIONS IN MEXICO. THIS DESCRIPTION WAS MADE ACROSS A RANGE OF TAXONOMIC, SECTORAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABLES, AND ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY KNOWLEDGE GAPS WITHIN THESE AREAS. OVERALL, COSTS OF INVASIONS IN MEXICO WERE ESTIMATED AT US$ 5.33 BILLION (I.E., 109) ($MXN 100.84 BILLION) DURING THE PERIOD FROM 1992 TO 2019. BIOLOGICAL INVASION COSTS WERE SPLIT RELATIVELY EVENLY BETWEEN AQUATIC (US$ 1.16 BILLION; $MXN 21.95 BILLION) AND TERRESTRIAL (US$ 1.17 BILLION; $MXN 22.14 BILLION) INVADERS, BUT SEMI-AQUATIC TAXA DOMINATED (US$ 2.99 BILLION; $MXN 56.57 BILLION), WITH COSTS FROM DAMAGES TO RESOURCES FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN THOSE FROM MANAGEMENT OF IAS (US$ 4.29 BILLION VS. US$ 1.04 BILLION; $MXN 81.17 BILLION VS $MXN 19.68 BILLION). THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR INCURRED THE HIGHEST COSTS (US$ 1.01 BILLION; $MXN 19.1 BILLION), FOLLOWED BY FISHERIES (US$ 517.24 MILLION; $MXN 9.79 BILLION), WHILST MOST OTHER COSTS SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPACTED MIXED OR UNSPECIFIED SECTORS. WHEN DEFINED, COSTS TO MEXICAN NATURAL PROTECTED AREAS WERE MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGEMENT ACTIONS IN TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AND WERE INCURRED THROUGH OFFICIAL AUTHORITIES VIA MONITORING, CONTROL OR ERADICATION. ON NATURAL PROTECTED ISLANDS, MAINLY MAMMALS WERE MANAGED (I.E. RODENTS, CATS AND GOATS), TO A TOTAL OF US$ 3.99 MILLION, WHILE FERAL COWS, FISHES AND PLANTS WERE MOSTLY MANAGED IN PROTECTED MAINLAND AREAS, AMOUNTING TO US$ 1.11 MILLION IN TOTAL. PTERYGOPLI-CHTHYS SP. AND EICHHORNIA CRASSIPES CAUSED THE GREATEST REPORTED COSTS IN UNPROTECTED AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS IN MEXICO, AND BEMISIA TABACI TO TERRESTRIAL SYSTEMS. ALTHOUGH REPORTED DAMAGES FROM INVASIONS APPEARED TO BE FLUCTUATING THROUGH TIME IN MEXICO, MANAGEMENT SPENDING HAS BEEN INCREASING. THESE ESTIMATES, ALBEIT CONSERVATIVE, UNDERLINE THE MONETARY PRESSURE THAT INVASIONS PUT ON THE MEXICAN ECONOMY, CALLING FOR URGENT ACTIONS ALONGSIDE COMPREHENSIVE COST REPORTING IN NATIONAL STATES SUCH AS MEXICO. © 2021 AXEL EDUARDO RICO-SÁNCHEZ ET AL.

THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BOTH OF THESE CONVENTIONS IN THE UK THROUGH A MIXED-METHODS STUDY INCLUDING CONTENT ANALYSIS OF CONVENTION DOCUMENTATION AND EIGHT SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT WHILST THE UK HAS A REPUTATION FOR ACTIVELY ENGAGING IN WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AND BEING A NATION OF ANIMAL LOVERS, MANAGEMENT OF ITS OWN WILDLIFE IS UNDER RESOURCED AND COULD BE IMPROVED.

IT WAS FOUND THAT 221.3 KM2 (33.3%) OF THE FORESTED AREAS HAVE HIGH HUMAN INTERFERENCE IN THE FORM OF LOGGING, INDISCRIMINATE TREE FALLING AND FUEL WOOD COLLECTION, WHILE 26% WAS MODERATELY AFFECTED AND 18% OF THE RESERVE HAD NO IMPACT. AMONG VEGETATION RESOURCES, FUEL WOOD WAS USED IN THE HIGHEST QUANTITY (28%) FOLLOWED BY BAMBOO AND EDIBLE PLANTS (21%) AND (11%), RESPECTIVELY. ETHNO-ZOOLOGICAL USAGE COMPRISES OF PARTS OF ANIMALS LIKE SNAKE, BEAR, MONITOR LIZARD, AND PORCUPINE. SUN BEARS WERE CONSIDERED PESTS THAT FEED ON MAIZE, CUCUMBER, SWEET POTATO AND PUMPKINS GROWN IN ‘JHUM' CROP FIELDS. ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURES FROM FARM-BUSH HUNTING, MONOCULTURE, AND UNPLANNED ROADS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO SEVERE BIODIVERSITY LOSS, AND MUST BE CONSTRAINED FOR THE CONSERVATION OF SUN BEAR AND THEIR HABITAT IN THE REGION. THE LAND USE/ LAND COVER ON HUMAN BUILT-UP, JHUM LAND (CURRENT AND ABANDONED JHUM/SHIFTING CULTIVATION), FORESTS (DENSE AND OPEN), BAMBOO FOREST, PLANTATION ETC. WERE USED TO DEVELOP MAPS FOR EACH VILLAGE. THE LAND USE PATTERN FOR THE EIGHT VILLAGES STUDIED. INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM MIRSAC AND ITS MAPPING IN ARCVIEW SHOWS THAT HIGHEST NUMBER OF AGRICULTURAL LAND WAS IN VILLAGES OF WEST PHAILENG (319SQ.HA) AND DAMPARENGPUI (283.8SQ.HA). CLOSED OR DENSE FOREST WAS IN HIGHEST PROPORTION IN PHULDUNGSEI AND LEAST IN TUIPUIBARI (120SQ.HA). GRAZING ACTIVITIES WAS RELATIVELY LOW OR ABSENT IN MOST PART OF DTR. ABANDONED JHUM FIELDS WERE IN LARGEST NUMBER IN DAMPARENGPUI (939.60SQ.HA) FOLLOWED BY SILSURI (881.17SQ.HA) AND SERHMUN (880.99SQ.HA). © 2021 GOUDA ET AL.

NEVERTHLESS, FOREST FRAGMENTS STILL RETAIN HIGH LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. THE HAUTE MATSIATRA REGION (SOUTH-EASTERN MADAGASCAR) HOSTS THE RENOWNED ANDRINGITRA NATIONAL PARK AND SEVERAL SURROUNDING ISOLATED FOREST FRAGMENTS EMBEDDED IN A MATRIX OF HUMAN-DOMINATED LANDSCAPE. DURING A HERPETOLOGICAL SURVEY CONDUCTED IN THE REGION, WE VISITED A TOTAL OF 25 SITES. WE APPLIED A MOLECULAR TAXONOMIC APPROACH TO IDENTIFY THE COLLECTED MATERIAL AND GENERATE NEW REFERENCE SEQUENCES TO IMPROVE THE MOLECULAR IDENTIFICATION OF MALAGASY HERPETOFAUNA. WE IDENTIFIED A TOTAL OF 28 AMPHIBIAN AND 38 SQUAMATE TAXA AND PROVIDED A SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT FOR EACH ONE OF THEM. NINE OF THE IDENTIFIED TAXA ARE CANDIDATE SPECIES, AMONGST WHICH ONE WAS NEWLY IDENTIFIED. WE EXTENDED THE KNOWN DISTRIBUTIONAL RANGE OF 21 TAXA (NINE AMPHIBIANS AND 12 SQUAMATES). ALTHOUGH THE LARGEST FOREST FRAGMENTS HOLD A HIGHER NUMBER OF SPECIES, WE ALSO DETECTED A RELATIVELY HIGH HERPETOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IN SMALL PATCHES. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTIGATING SMALL FOREST FRAGMENTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PATTERNS OF DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES OF MADAGASCAR.

WHILE GLOBALLY WIDESPREAD, THE DISTRIBUTION MARGINS OF BD AND BSAL HAVE NOT BEEN DETERMINED, AND THE PRESENCE OF THESE PATHOGENS HAS PROBABLY GONE UNNOTICED IN MANY AREAS, ESPECIALLY IN NORTHERN EURASIA. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PRESENCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF BOTH PATHOGENS IN THE NORTHERN TEMPERATE AND BOREAL FOREST BIOMES, 243 INDIVIDUALS WERE SAMPLED FROM 8 NATIVE AMPHIBIAN SPECIES ACROSS ESTONIA. ADDITIONALLY, 68 AMPHIBIANS WERE SAMPLED FROM CAPTIVE COLLECTIONS IN ESTONIA AND LATVIA. PATHOGEN INFECTION WAS ASSESSED USING METABARCODING OF THE ITS2 MARKER. NO POSITIVE MATCHES FOR BSAL INFECTION WERE FOUND. BD WAS DETECTED IN 13 SPECIMENS, 3 OF WHICH WERE SAMPLED AT THE RIGA ZOO (WITH A PREVALENCE OF 5.2%) AND 10 IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS IN ESTONIA (3.3%).

BIOL. TROP.,1,"INTRODUCTION: ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS IS INTRODUCING NON-NATIVE SPECIES IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS. THIS REPRESENTS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN THE WORLD. PANGASIANODON HYPOPHTHALMUS IS AN INTRODUCED SPECIES IN COLOMBIA THAT SHARES LIFE CHARACTERISTICS AND HABITAT WITH ENDANGERED NATIVE SPECIES, SUCH AS AGENEIOSUS PARDALIS, SORUBIM CUSPICAUDUS, AND PSEUDOPLATYSTOMA MAGDALENIATUM. HOWEVER, ITS DISTRIBUTION IS LITTLE-KNOWN, AND SCIENTISTS HAVE BARELY EXPLORED THE EFFECTS ON THE NATIVE FAUNA. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE P. HYPOPHTHALMUS INVASIVE POTENTIAL IN SOME OF THE COLOMBIAN BASINS, WHICH DRAIN INTO THE CARIBBEAN SEA. METHODS: USING RECORDS AVAILABLE IN VARIOUS DATABASES, WE PERFORMED A NICHE CONSERVATISM ANALYSIS BETWEEN THE NATIVE AND INTRODUCED RECORDS OF P. HYPOPHTHALMUS USING THE R PACKAGE ECOSPAT. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE MODELED THE POTENTIAL INVASION AREA OF P. HYPOPHTHALMUS AND THE DISTRIBUTION AREAS OF THREE NATIVE SPECIES, PERFORMING ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELING (ENM) USING THE MAXENT ALGORITHM. FINALLY, WE CALCULATED A GEOGRAPHIC NICHE OVERLAP BETWEEN THE NON-NATIVE AND NATIVE SPECIES. RESULTS: THE ECOSPAT SPATIAL ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT P. HYPOPHTHALMUS RETAINS SOME ENVIRONMENTAL NICHE ATTRIBUTES THROUGH SPACE. FOR THIS REASON, WE CAN USE ENM AS AN APPROXIMATION TO ITS RANGE OF DISTRIBUTION IN THE INVADED AREA. OUR RESULTS USING ENM DEMONSTRATED THAT THE FOUR SPECIES ANALYZED PREFER LOW AND SLIGHTLY ROCKY REGIONS; THEREFORE, THE GEOGRAPHICAL OVERLAP OF THE THREE NATIVE SPECIES’ ECOLOGICAL NICHES AND THE INTRODUCED SPECIES EXCEED 80 %. CONCLUSIONS: THERE ARE ADEQUATE CONDITIONS IN THE STUDY BASINS TO FULLY ESTABLISH THE SPECIES P. HYPOPHTHALMUS, REPRESENTING A HIGH RISK FOR AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS AND NATIVE ICHTHYOFAUNA.

IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, EFFORTS TO ALIGN BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND LIVELIHOOD GOALS HAVE TRIGGERED A SHIFT FROM PURE PROTECTED AREA APPROACHES TO A HYBRID SCENARIO, INCLUDING DIVERSE PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS, THAT CONSIDER LIVELIHOOD NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES NEIGHBORING PROTECTED AREAS. THESE PARTNERSHIPS OFTEN INCLUDE TOURISM TO PROVIDE INCOME AND JOBS. THE FUTURE OF THE AMBOSELI LANDSCAPE IN KENYA HAS BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF THESE DEBATES, SINCE IT HAS FACED LONG-LASTING CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES. MANY INITIATIVES, OFTEN IN THE FORM OF PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS, HAVE TRIED TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. BY USING THE SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOOD FRAMEWORK (SLF) AND A SET OF INDICATORS TO MEASURE THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO CONSERVATION, WE EXAMINE TWO OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS—THE AMBOSELI ECOSYSTEM TRUST (AET) AND BIG LIFE FOUNDATION (BLF)—WITH THE AIM OF UNDERSTANDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY CONTRIBUTE TO ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES. DATA WERE COLLECTED USING DOCUMENT ANALYSIS, IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS, FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, NONPARTICIPANT OBSERVATION, AND INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS. FINDINGS SHOW THAT BOTH AET AND BLF HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS DIRECT DRIVERS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS (SUCH AS HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICTS, POACHING, UNPLANNED INFRASTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENTS) AND—TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT—THE INDIRECT DRIVERS, SUCH AS POVERTY AND LAND SUBDIVISION. THROUGH THE WORKINGS OF BOTH PARTNERSHIPS, MORE COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE GAINED ACCESS TO SPECIFIC COMMUNITY CAPITAL ASSETS, THROUGH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHER MONETARY INCENTIVES AND EDUCATION.

TO INFORM ENDANGERED SPECIES CONSERVATION EFFORTS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO IMPROVE OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE BD INFECTION DYNAMICS IN THE WILD. HERE, WE ANALYZED VARIATION OF BD INFECTION IN THE REDBELLY TOAD MELANOPHRYNISCUS MONTEVIDENSIS, A THREATENED BUFONID FROM URUGUAY. WE TESTED THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, SEASON, AND HOST POPULATION SIZE ON BD PREVALENCE AND INTENSITY. ADDITIONALLY, CONSIDERING THE SUBLETHAL EFFECTS OF BD, WE TESTED IF THESE VARIABLES, POTENTIALLY THROUGH THEIR EFFECT ON BD, ALSO EXPLAIN THE VARIATION IN HOST BODY CONDITION. WE DETERMINED A HIGH BD PREVALENCE OF 41% (100/241), AND THAT POPULATION SIZE INFLUENCED BOTH BD PREVALENCE AND INFECTION INTENSITY. WE IDENTIFIED AN EFFECT OF PRECIPITATION AND SEASON ON BD INFECTION INTENSITY AND AN EFFECT OF SEASON ON TOAD BODY CONDITION. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF INFECTION INTENSITY ON BODY CONDITION; MOREOVER, WHILE SOME TOADS CLEARED THE INFECTION, THEIR BODY CONDITION DID NOT IMPROVE, SUGGESTING A LONGTERM COST. THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT ON HOST POPULATION SIZE AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN BD INFECTION DYNAMICS IN A THREATENED ANURAN SPECIES, AND SEASONAL DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES APPEAR TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DYNAMICS. FINALLY, WE HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR MONITORING BD IN THIS AND OTHER ENDANGERED AMPHIBIAN POPULATIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITHIN THE GENUS MELANOPHRYNISCUS, WHICH INCLUDES SEVERAL ENDANGERED AND DATA DEFICIENT SPECIES IN SOUTH AMERICA. © INTER-RESEARCH 2021.",NA,NA,DAORE,"PONTES, M.R.; LABORATÓRIO DE HISTÓRIA NATURAL DE ANFÍBIOS BRASILEIROS (LAHNAB), SP, BRAZIL; EMAIL: MAAH.RETUCI@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.3354/dao03603,"CH FOUNDATIONCH FOUNDATION FUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SÃO PAULOFUNDAÇÃO DE AMPARO À PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SÃO PAULO, FAPESP, 2016/25358-3, 2018/08650-8, 2020/00099-0 COORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIORCOORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIOR, CAPES CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICO, CNPQ, 300896/2016-6, 302834/ 2020-6",1775103,DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS,ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,NA,79-88,INTER-RESEARCH,34137378,SCOPUS,SEASONAL VARIATION OF BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS IN A THREATENED ANURAN SPECIES FROM URUGUAY,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108382072&doi=10.3354%2fdao03603&partnerID=40&md5=fd53169c8201c91c6aff4fa4f792b883,145,2021,"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THIS ILLEGAL TRADE IS AN IMPORTANT FACET OF WILDLIFE FORENSIC SCIENCES AND CAN BE A KEY FACTOR IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF EFFECTIVE LEGISLATION SURROUNDING THE ILLEGAL TRADE OF PROTECTED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES. HOWEVER, THE SCIENCE OF WILDLIFE FORENSICS IS LIMITED BY THE ABSENCE OF A COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE FOR WILDLIFE INVESTIGATIONS. INTER-SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEAT MARKERS (ISSR) COUPLED WITH HIGH RESOLUTION MELTING ANALYSIS (HRM) HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVELY USED FOR SPECIES IDENTIFICATION OF 38 MAMMALIAN SPECIES.

UNRAVEL-ING THE SPATIAL OVERLAP BETWEEN NIFS AND CRITICALLY ENDANGERED (CR) FISH SPECIES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO TARGETED CONSERVATION ACTIONS TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS. IN THIS STUDY, WE APPLIED GEOSTATISTICAL ANALYSES TO INVESTIGATE THE SPATIAL OVERLAP OF NIFS AGAINST FISH SPECIES THAT ARE DESIG-NATED UNDER THE CR STATUS ACCORDING TO THE IUCN AND THE HELLENIC ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY (HZS) RED LISTS. DISTRIBUTIONAL DATA (PRESENCE–ABSENCE) FROM 800 RECORDS OF 52 NIFS WERE COMPILED FOR BOTH LENTIC AND LOTIC ECOSYSTEMS OF GREECE. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS UNDER HIGH NIFS RICHNESS WERE LOCATED MAINLY IN LOWLAND AREAS AND OFTEN NEAR LARGE CITIES AND ECOSYSTEMS WITH WELL-DEVELOPED COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHERIES. ON THE CONTRARY, LOW NIFS RICHNESS WAS OB-SERVED IN MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS AND IN RELATIVELY SMALL RIVER BASINS. OVERLAPPING AREAS OF CR SPECIES WITH MODERATE TO HIGH NIFS RICHNESS (1.5–4.3 NIFS PER 1 KM2 ) WERE RELATIVELY HIGH (~50%). A QUARTER OF THE OVERLAPPING AREAS (24.8%) FALL WITHIN NATURA 2000 NETWORK, WHERE LEGAL MANAGEMENT BODIES COULD IMPLEMENT SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS TO MINIMIZE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS.

IN SOUTH AFRICA, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF NONHUMAN PRIMATES HAVE ENTERED INTO REHABILITATION CENTERS DUE TO ANIMAL-HUMAN CONFLICTS. THE HIGH ACCUMULATION OF THESE PRIMATES HAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN THE NEED FOR GROUP FORMATION AND RELEASES AT REHABILITATION CENTERS. ALTHOUGH THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE (IUCN) HAS PUBLISHED GENERIC GUIDELINES FOR THE RELEASE OF NONHUMAN PRIMATES, IT RECOMMENDS SPECIES-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES BE PUBLISHED FOR OPTIMAL RELEASE SUCCESS. ADDITIONALLY, THEY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF FOLLOWING BEST PRACTICE MANAGEMENT APPROACHES TO MAXIMIZE CONSERVATION EFFORTS AND INDIVIDUAL WELFARE OF DISPLACED SPECIES, WHILE ALSO AIMING TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE BEST PRACTICE APPROACHES. TO DATE, THERE ARE ONLY A FEW PUBLISHED SPECIES-SPECIFIC REHABILITATION AND RELEASE PROTOCOLS FOR PRIMATES. WE, THEREFORE, CREATED SPECIES-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR THE REHABILITATION OF CHACMA BABOONS (PAPIO URSINUS) FOR REINFORCEMENT. THE PROPOSED GUIDELINES ARE BASED ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIORS, AND THE ECOLOGY OF CHACMA BABOONS (PAPIO URSINUS) FOR REHABILITATION, RELEASE, AND POST-RELEASE ASSESSMENTS. OUR GUIDELINES INCLUDE SEVEN DISTINCT STEPS: ARRIVAL, CONSPECIFIC RESOCIALIZATION, HOUSING, TRAINING, AND PREPARATION, PRE-RELEASE ASSESSMENT, RELEASE-SITE SELECTION, RELEASE, AND POST-RELEASE ASSESSMENT. WE PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION AND EXAMPLES OF EACH STEP BASED ON THE PROTOCOLS FROM THE RIVERSIDE WILDLIFE REHABILITATION CENTRE (RIVERSIDE), A REHABILITATION CENTER IN THE LIMPOPO PROVINCE OF SOUTH AFRICA THAT HAS HAD SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION AND RELEASE PROJECTS FOR CHACMA BABOONS, AMONG OTHER PRIMATES.

THERE IS GROWING RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO RECONCILE THESE IMPACTS TO ACHIEVE SOCIALLY AND ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AGENDAS. ELK POPULATIONS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE DOUBLED IN THE PAST 35 YEARS, MARKING A CONSERVATION SUCCESS, BUT ALSO INCREASING FORAGE LOSS AND DAMAGE TO INFRASTRUCTURE ON PRIVATE LAND. WILDLIFE MANAGERS ARE PURSUING THE GOAL OF INCREASING ELK NUMBERS ON PUBLIC LANDS, BUT ELK ARE PREFERENTIALLY UTILIZING PRIVATE PASTURE AND RANGELAND, DRIVING CONFLICT WITH BEEF AND DAIRY PRODUCERS. WE CONDUCTED 17 SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH PRIVATE LANDOWNERS, PRIMARILY BEEF AND DAIRY PRODUCERS, IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO UNDERSTAND THEIR EXPERIENCES AND REACTIONS TO ELK CONFLICT AND STATE WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT. LANDOWNERS REPORT THAT ELK DENSITY ON PRIVATE RANGELAND HAS STEADILY INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS AND POSES A THREAT TO THEIR BUSINESSES DUE TO LOSS OF FORAGE, DAMAGE TO FENCES, AND THE CORRESPONDING LIABILITY RISK POSED BY BREACHED FENCES AND ERRANT CATTLE. THE ABSENCE OF CROP AND FORAGE LOSS COMPENSATION, DIFFICULTY OBTAINING DEPREDATION PERMITS, AND LOW HARVEST QUOTAS FOR RECREATIONAL HUNTING LIMIT LANDOWNER MITIGATION OPTIONS AND FOSTER RESENTMENT TOWARD THE STATE WILDLIFE AGENCY. MOST LANDOWNERS BELIEVE THAT CURRENT ELK MANAGEMENT POLICIES, INCLUDING RESTRICTED HUNTING OPPORTUNITIES, DO NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS ELK CONFLICT, CREATING NOVEL CHALLENGES FOR WILDLIFE OFFICIALS TASKED WITH RECONCILING ELK RESTORATION GOALS WITH A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS EXPERIENCING ECONOMIC LOSSES AND THREATS TO RURAL LIVELIHOODS.

SOME INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUES SUCH AS THE USE OF DRONES-ALSO CALLED UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE/SYSTEM (UAV/UAS)-OFFER PROMISING OPPORTUNITIES. THE POTENTIAL OF UAS-BASED WILDLIFE CENSUS USING HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGERY IS NOW WELL ESTABLISHED FOR TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS OR BIRDS THAT CAN BE SEEN ON IMAGES. NEVERTHELESS, THE ABILITY OF UASS TO DETECT NON-CONSPICUOUS SPECIES, SUCH AS SMALL BIRDS BELOW THE FOREST CANOPY, REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION. THIS ISSUE CAN BE SOLVED WITH BIOACOUSTICS FOR ACOUSTICALLY ACTIVE SPECIES SUCH AS BATS AND BIRDS. IN THIS CONTEXT, UASS REPRESENT AN INTERESTING SOLUTION THAT COULD BE DEPLOYED ON A LARGER SCALE, AT LOWER RISK FOR THE OPERATOR, AND OVER HARD-TO-REACH LOCATIONS, SUCH AS FOREST CANOPIES OR COMPLEX TOPOGRAPHIES, WHEN COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL PROTOCOLS (FIXED LOCATION RECORDERS PLACED OR HANDLED BY HUMAN OPERATORS). IN THIS CONTEXT, THIS STUDY PROPOSES A METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL OF UASS IN BIOACOUSTIC SURVEYS FOR BIRDS AND BATS, USING LOW-COST AUDIBLE AND ULTRASOUND RECORDERS MOUNTED ON A LOW-COST QUADCOPTER UAS (DJI PHANTOM 3 PRO). THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGICAL WORKFLOW CAN BE STRAIGHTFORWARDLY REPLICATED IN OTHER CONTEXTS TO TEST THE IMPACT OF OTHER UAS BIOACOUSTIC RECORDING PLATFORMS IN RELATION TO THE TARGETED SPECIES AND THE SPECIFIC UAS DESIGN. THIS PROTOCOL ALLOWS ONE TO EVALUATE THE SENSITIVITY OF UAS APPROACHES THROUGH THE ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECTIVE DETECTION RADIUS FOR THE DIFFERENT SPECIES INVESTIGATED AT SEVERAL FLIGHT HEIGHTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST A STRONG POTENTIAL FOR THE BIOACOUSTIC MONITORING OF BIRDS BUT ARE MORE CONTRASTED FOR BAT RECORDINGS, MAINLY DUE TO QUADCOPTER NOISE (I.E., ELECTRONIC SPEED CONTROLLER (ESC) NOISE) BUT ALSO, IN A CERTAIN MANNER, TO THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN (USE OF A DIRECTIONAL SPEAKER WITH LIMITED CALL INTENSITY). TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS THE USE OF A WINCH TO SAFELY EXTENT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE UAS AND THE RECORDER DURING UAS SOUND RECORDINGS OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INNOVATIVE PLATFORM, SUCH AS A PLANE-BLIMP HYBRID UAS, SHOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

WE UTILISED AN ETHNOGRAPHIC MIXED-METHODS APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE: 1) PERCEIVED SOCIOCULTURAL BENEFITS OF CORAL RESTORATION TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY; 2) IMPACTS OF REEF RESTORATION ON LOCAL FOOD SECURITY; AND 3) LOCAL SOCIOCULTURAL BARRIERS AND LIMITATIONS OF REEF RESTORATION AS A MECHANISM FOR IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY. WE FOUND FISH CONTRIBUTED TO FOOD SECURITY PRIMARILY AS AN INCOME SOURCE TO PURCHASE FOOD. LOCAL PEOPLE MAINLY VALUED NEARBY REEFS FOR STORM PROTECTION. FURTHERMORE, MOST FISHERS ARE ORGANISED THROUGH PATRON-CLIENT SYSTEMS THAT TARGET PELAGIC SPECIES; THEREFORE THEY CURRENTLY HAVE MINIMAL DEPENDENCY ON ADJACENT REEFS. HOWEVER, FISHING RESTRICTIONS LINKED TO THE RESTORATION PROGRAMME STILL NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BOTH PELAGIC FISHERS AND A SMALL POPULATION OF REEF-BASED FISHERS-INDIRECTLY BY DAMAGING RECIPROCAL FISHING RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURING ISLANDS AND DIRECTLY BY LIMITING ACCESS TO LOCAL REEFS. COMPLEX SOCIAL AND TRADE NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH PATRON-CLIENT NETWORKS PRESENT POTENTIAL BARRIERS FOR TRANSITIONING TO REEF-BASED FISHERIES AND ERADICATING THE USE OF DESTRUCTIVE FISHING GEAR, THEREFORE LIMITING ACCESS TO POTENTIAL FOOD SECURITY BENEFITS GENERATED FROM REEF RESTORATION. THESE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORAL RESTORATION AND FOOD SECURITY IS TENUOUS AND CANNOT BE ASSUMED.

THE VAST AMOUNT OF PREDICTED RAPID URBANIZATION IN THE COMING YEARS CONSUMING HABITATS AND REDUCING THE POSSIBILITIES FOR WILDLIFE TO THRIVE IN CITIES, AND IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOSS OF GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY. AMONG THEM, BIRDS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF URBAN ECOSYSTEM AND A KEY TARGET FOR URBAN BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION. BESIDES, IT IS ALSO A RESEARCH HOTSPOT. THE LAST 20 YEARS OF URBAN BIRD ECOLOGY RESEARCH HAVE EXPERIENCED EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND NOW ENABLES LITERATURE ANALYSES AND REVIEWS. HERE, WE TRY TO ROUNDUP THESE PRESENT FINDINGS ON URBAN BIRD COMMUNITIES RESEARCH FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, OVERVIEWING PATTERNS AND VARIATION PROCESSES ON URBAN BIRD COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY THE CHANGES IN COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE, SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION, LIVING HABITS AND THE WAY OF BREEDING AND NESTING UNDER THIS CONTINUOUS AND RAPID URBANIZATION. TO FURTHER ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF AND CONTRIBUTIONS PROVIDED BY URBAN GREEN SPACE AND VEGETATION TO THE URBAN BIRD COMMUNITY, EXPLORING ITS AFFECTING MECHANISMS THAT SUPPORT BIRD DIVERSITY IN URBAN AREAS, WE REVIEWED THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE FOR SUCH STUDIES. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT: 1) PROVISION OF GREENERY CAN AMELIORATE THE HOSTILITY OF THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT FOR WILDLIFE, AS WELL AS PROVIDE SUITABLE LIVING SPACE AND FOOD RESOURCES FOR URBAN BIRDS. GREEN SPACES PROVIDE THE MOST IMPORTANT HABITATS FOR URBAN BIRDS. 2) NOT ALL FORMS OF GREENING BENEFIT BIRD COMMUNITIES TO THE SAME EXTENT. COMPARED TO THOSE AREAS THAT DO NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO NATIVE PLANT PROTECTION, AREAS THAT RETAIN NATURAL OR SEMI-NATURAL COVER AND LARGE TREES CAN SUPPORT RICHER BIRD SPECIES. 3) STRUCTURE AND COVERAGE OF VEGETATION HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON BIRD COMMUNITIES. THE INCREASING CANOPY COVERAGE, COMPLEX VERTICAL STRUCTURES AND MANY KINDS OF PLANT SPECIES CAN PRODUCE VARIOUS TYPES OF PLANT SPACES AND HETEROGENETIC HABITATS. THE INCREASED PLANT SPACES AND HABITATS CAN CAUSE CHANGES IN BIRD COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, A CORRESPONDINGLY INCREASE IN SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY. IN CONCLUSION, MAINTAINING AND STRENGTHENING THE HEALTHY AND STABLE OF VEGETATION COMMUNITIES IN CITIES IS AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO CONSERVE URBAN BIODIVERSITY. COLLECTIVELY, PROTECTING EXISTING AND PLANTING NEW GREENERY HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO RESTRAINT URBAN BIODIVERSITY LOSS. BASED ON THESE, WE PROPOSE THE FUTURE RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT DIRECTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT AND BIRD COMMUNITIES.

J.,1,"TAXONOMY PRESENTS ITSELF AS THE CRITICAL BASIS OF ANY MODERN SCIENTIFIC DECISION-MAKING APPROACH IN THE LIVING WORLD, AND THEREFORE ACCURATE CLASSIFICATIONS HAVE TO BE SOUGHT. DUE TO ONGOING SPECIES NAMING DEBATES, HERE WE WOULD LIKE TO FACILITATE A DISCUSSION ON THE METHODS AND VALIDITY USED FOR TAXONOMIC CLAIMS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON CONSERVATION, ECOLOGY, AND MANAGEMENT FOR SQUIRRELS IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS A WIDER EXAMPLE. FOLLOWING THE ESTABLISHED EPIGENETIC APPROACH, WE EXAMINE THE RODENT GENUS TAMIASCIURUS. WE INCLUDE IN OUR ASSESSMENT ALL RELEVANT SPECIES-INTERFERING CHARACTERISTICS AND PRESENT ONE NEW PERSPECTIVE, ECOLOGICAL NICHES. THE ECOLOGICAL NICHE IS ESSENTIAL FOR EXPLAINING THE SPECIES’ BEHAVIOR PATTERNS AND THEIR DISCREPANCIES AMONG THE CONGENERS, ADDING INSIGHTS INTO PHYLOGENESIS. WE ADD THE USAGE OF MAPPING SOFTWARE SUCH AS GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (ARCGIS, OPEN QGIS) FOR THIS GENUS, AS WELL AS BEST-AVAILABLE OPEN ACCESS DATA AND THE STATISTICAL AID FROM R. MISCLASSIFICATIONS IN THE TAXONOMY ARE KNOWN TO LEAD TO CONSERVATION FAILURES ON A CONTINENTAL AND SOCIETAL SCALE, IN PART CAUSED BY A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE BY THE PUBLIC AND THE MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN SCIENTISTS AND THE PUBLIC. AS ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION, HERE WE SUGGEST A RECLASSIFICATION FOR MEARNS’S SQUIRREL (TAMIASCIURUS MEARNSI) AND A DESCRIPTION UPDATE FOR THE ENTIRE TAMIASCIURUS GENUS TO IMPROVE CONSERVATION SUCCESS. ADDITIONAL SOLUTIONS ARE PRESENTED TO SIMPLIFY CLASSIFICATION WITH REDUCED ERRORS AND CONFUSION IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM. A LARGER FUTURE EFFORT OF THIS STYLE IS SOUGHT TO GREATLY DECREASE MARGINALIZATION, TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT LACK OF RESEARCH PRIORITY AND “LAISSEZ-FAIRE” ATTITUDES ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES FOR A BETTER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMANS AND THE BIOTIC WORLD.

IT IS THUS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT AND TYPES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND FUNCTIONAL GUILD ALTERATION CAUSED BY LAND USE CHANGE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE SUSTAINABLE LAND USE POLICIES. HERE WE STUDY THE EFFECTS OF LAND USE CHANGE ON FOREST BIRD SPECIES AND GUILDS IN A HUMAN-DOMINATED LANDSCAPE IN THE WESTERN HIMALAYA, INDIA. WE CARRIED OUT SYSTEMATIC BREEDING-SEASON SURVEYS IN SIX LAND USE TYPES WITHIN MOIST TEMPERATE FOREST: NATURAL (PROTECTED) OAK FOREST, DEGRADED (LIGHTLY USED) OAK FOREST, LOPPED (HEAVILY USED) OAK FOREST, PINE FOREST, CULTIVATION AND BUILT-UP SITES, IN TWO ADJOINING LANDSCAPES, OVER TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS. OUR STUDY SHOWS MODERATE TO DRASTIC SPECIES LOSS IN ALL MODIFIED LAND USE TYPES IN COMPARISON TO NATURAL OAK FOREST. SPECIES COMPOSITION IN MODIFIED LAND USE TYPES DIVERGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM NATURAL OAK; THIS EFFECT WAS HIGHEST IN CULTIVATION AND BUILT-UP SITES AND LEAST IN DEGRADED FORESTS. COMPOSITIONAL CHANGE IN MODIFIED LAND USES OCCURRED DUE TO PARTIAL REPLACEMENT OF FOREST SPECIALISTS WITH COMMENSALS AND OPEN COUNTRY SPECIES, WHEREAS ABUNDANCE OF FOREST GENERALISTS WAS RELATIVELY CONSTANT ACROSS THE GRADIENT. WE ALSO FIND A STEEP DECLINE IN THE ABUNDANCE OF FUNCTIONAL GUILDS SUCH AS POLLINATORS, AND INSECTIVOROUS PEST CONTROLLERS IN ALL MODIFIED LAND USES IN COMPARISON TO NATURAL OAK FOREST.

TO STUDY THIS, WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF PA COVERAGE ON AVIAN COMMUNITIES IN FINLAND BETWEEN TWO STUDY PERIODS OF 1980–1999 AND 2000–2015. CLIMATE-DRIVEN COMMUNITY IMPACTS WERE INVESTIGATED BY USING COMMUNITY TEMPERATURE INDEX (CTI). WE USED LINEAR MODELS TO STUDY THE ASSOCIATION OF PA COVERAGE AND THE CTI CHANGES IN SOUTHERN, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FINLAND. IN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL FINLAND, HIGHER PA COVERAGE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER CHANGES IN CTI AND 45% PA COVERAGE IN NORTHERN AND 13% IN CENTRAL FINLAND CORRESPONDED WITH COMPLETE MITIGATION OF CTI INCREASE. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT HIGHER PA COVERAGE STRONGLY INCREASES COMMUNITY RESILIENCE TO WARMING CLIMATE. HOWEVER A SIMILAR ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PA COVERAGE AND CHANGES IN CTI WAS NOT APPARENT IN SOUTHERN FINLAND. THE PA COVERAGE IN SOUTHERN FINLAND WAS MUCH LOWER THAN IN THE TWO OTHER SECTIONS AND THUS, MAY BE TOO SPARSE TO FAVOUR COMMUNITY RESILIENCE AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE.

WE CONDUCTED BIRD SURVEYS AT 11 PEATLANDS IN WESTERN FINLAND, WHERE EACH OF THE RESTORED AND THEIR PRISTINE COUNTERPARTS WERE SURVEYED BEFORE RESTORATION AND YEARLY AFTER RESTORATION DURING 2010–2018. WE USED LINEAR MIXED EFFECT MODELS TO ANALYZE WHETHER RESTORATION AFFECTED THE NUMBER OF SPECIES AND TERRITORIES OF PEATLAND SPECIALIST AND NON-SPECIALIST SPECIES AND PERMUTATIONAL MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE TO ANALYZE THE CHANGE IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. DRAINED PARTS OF THE PEATLANDS HAD HIGHER NUMBER OF TERRITORIES OF NON-SPECIALIST SPECIES BEFORE RESTORATION, AND RESTORATION SEEMED TO DECREASE THESE NUMBERS TOWARDS THE LEVEL OF PRISTINE PARTS. BY CONTRAST, RESTORATION DID NOT AFFECT THE NUMBER OF PEATLAND SPECIALISTS AND THEIR TERRITORIES, WHICH WAS LOWER IN DRAINED THAN IN PRISTINE PARTS OF THE PEATLANDS. BIRD COMMUNITIES IN RESTORED PARTS REMAINED DIFFERENT FROM PRISTINE PARTS IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AFTER RESTORATION. THUS, DESPITE THE EFFECT OF RESTORATION ON NON-SPECIALISTS, A SUBSTANTIALLY LONG TIME MAY BE REQUIRED FOR A RECOVERY OF THE PEATLAND BIRD COMMUNITIES. BASED ON OUR RESULTS, IT SEEMS THAT LONG-TERM MONITORING OF THE RESTORED AND PRISTINE PEATLANDS IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER RESTORATION IS EFFECTIVE IN RECOVERING THE PEATLAND SPECIALIST BIRD SPECIES AND BIRD COMMUNITIES IN GENERAL. © 2020 SOCIETY FOR ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION",E13304,NA,NA,"ALSILA, T.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, PO BOX 35, FINLAND; EMAIL: TERHI.S.ALSILA@GMAIL.COM; ELO, M.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, PO BOX 35, FINLAND; EMAIL: MERJA.T.ELO@JYU.FI; ELO, M.; SCHOOL OF RESOURCE WISDOM, PO BOX 35, FINLAND; EMAIL: MERJA.T.ELO@JYU.FI",ARTICLE,10.1111/rec.13304,KONEEN SÄÄTIÖKONEEN SÄÄTIÖ SUOMEN LUONNONSUOJELUN SÄÄTIÖSUOMEN LUONNONSUOJELUN SÄÄTIÖ,10612971,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,1,NA,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC.,NA,SCOPUS,EFFECTS OF HABITAT RESTORATION ON PEATLAND BIRD COMMUNITIES,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097019883&doi=10.1111%2frec.13304&partnerID=40&md5=1a9b54d5d3329591846b36636d097556,29,2021,"WE THANK THE FINNISH FOUNDATION FOR NATURE CONSERVATION, SUOMEN BIOLOGIAN SEURA VANAMO RY, SOCIETAS PRO FAUNA ET FLORA FENNICA, AND KESKI‐SUOMEN LINTUTIETEELLINEN YHDISTYS RY (KSLY) FOR FUNDING THE PROJECT DURING 2018 (FOR T.A.), AND KONE FOUNDATION (FOR M.E.).

NOVEL ECOSYSTEMS CREATED THROUGH HUMAN USE OF MINERAL RESOURCES, SUCH AS GRAVEL PIT LAKES, CAN PROVIDE SUBSTITUTE HABITATS FOR THE CONSERVATION OF FRESHWATER AND RIPARIAN BIODIVERSITY. MANY OF THESE ARTIFICIAL ECOSYSTEMS ARE SUBJECT TO A HIGH INTENSITY OF RECREATIONAL USE, HOWEVER, WHICH MAY LIMIT THEIR BIODIVERSITY POTENTIAL. THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF SEVERAL TAXA (PLANTS, AMPHIBIANS, DRAGONFLIES, DAMSELFLIES, WATERFOWL, AND SONGBIRDS) WAS ASSESSED AND A RANGE OF TAXONOMIC BIODIVERSITY METRICS WERE COMPARED BETWEEN GRAVEL PIT LAKES MANAGED FOR RECREATIONAL FISHERIES (N = 16) AND UNMANAGED REFERENCE LAKES (N = 10), CONTROLLING FOR NON-FISHING-RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION. THE AVERAGE SPECIES RICHNESS OF ALL THE TAXA EXAMINED WAS SIMILAR AMONG LAKES IN BOTH LAKE TYPES AND NO SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES COMPOSITION WERE FOUND WHEN EXAMINING THE POOLED SPECIES INVENTORY. SIMILARLY, THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LAKE TYPES IN THE PRESENCE OF RARE SPECIES AND IN THE SIMPSON DIVERSITY INDEX ACROSS ALL OF THE TAXA ASSESSED. VARIATION IN SPECIES RICHNESS AMONG LAKES WAS CORRELATED WITH WOODY HABITAT, LAKE MORPHOLOGY (SURFACE AREA AND STEEPNESS), AND LAND USE, BUT WAS NOT CORRELATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF RECREATIONAL FISHERIES. THUS, NON-FISHING-RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES HAD STRONGER EFFECTS ON LOCAL SPECIES PRESENCE THAN RECREATIONAL FISHERIES MANAGEMENT OR THE PRESENCE OF RECREATIONAL ANGLERS. COLLECTIVELY, NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND THAT ANGLERS AND RECREATIONAL FISHERIES MANAGEMENT CONSTRAIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AQUATIC AND RIPARIAN BIODIVERSITY IN GRAVEL PIT LAKES IN THE STUDY REGION; HOWEVER, THE CONSERVATION OF SPECIES DIVERSITY IN GRAVEL PIT LAKES COULD BENEFIT FROM AN INCREASING RELIANCE ON HABITAT ENHANCEMENT ACTIVITIES. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

HOWEVER, THE BREADTH OF RODENTS’ ECOLOGICAL IMPACT, EVEN AFTER ERADICATION, IS NOT ALWAYS FULLY RECOGNIZED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MOST WIDESPREAD INVASIVE RODENT, THE BLACK RAT (RATTUS RATTUS), WHILE OMNIVOROUS, EATS PREDOMINANTLY SEEDS AND FRUIT. YET, THE EFFECTS OF SEED PREDATION RELEASE AFTER ERADICATION ON PLANT COMMUNITIES AND ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD, POSING A GAP FOR ISLAND RESTORATION. WE EXAMINED THE ROLE OF SEED PREDATION RELEASE FOLLOWING BLACK RAT ERADICATION IN CHANGES TO TREE COMPOSITION AND ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS ACROSS AN ISLET NETWORK (PALMYRA ATOLL) IN THE CENTRAL PACIFIC. WE CONDUCTED REPEATED SURVEYS OF SEED, JUVENILE, AND ADULT TREE BIOMASS AND SURVIVAL IN PERMANENT VEGETATION PLOTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE ERADICATION OF RATS. WE OBSERVED A 95% REDUCTION IN SEED PREDATION FOR AN INTRODUCED, PREVIOUSLY CULTIVATED TREE POPULATION (COCOS NUCIFERA). JUVENILE TREE BIOMASS OF ALL SPECIES INCREASED 14-FOLD, WITH C. NUCIFERA INCREASING THE MOST, SUGGESTING THAT ERADICATION INCREASED THIS TREE'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. INDEED, BASED ON STAGE-STRUCTURED DEMOGRAPHIC MODELS, RAT ERADICATION LED TO A 10% INCREASE IN C. NUCIFERA POPULATION GROWTH RATE. THE EFFECT OF INVASIVE RODENT SEED PREDATION VARIES CONSIDERABLY AMONG THE PLANT SPECIES IN A COMMUNITY AND CAN SHIFT COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS, SOMETIMES IN FAVOR OF INVASIVE PLANTS. THESE BOTTOM-UP EFFECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN EVALUATING THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ERADICATION.

ALTHOUGH NEUTRAL GENETIC VARIATION CAN BE INFORMATIVE FOR DEMOGRAPHIC INFERENCES, IT MAY BE A POOR PREDICTOR OF ADAPTIVE GENETIC DIVERSITY AND THUS OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION ON SELECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE CONTRASTED PATTERNS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE OF NEUTRAL LOCI (MICROSATELLITES) AND IMMUNE GENES (I.E., TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS) IN AN UNDERSTOREY BIRD SPECIES, THE WEDGE-BILLED WOODCREEPER GLYPHORYNCHUS SPIRURUS. THE OBJECTIVES WERE (1) TO INVESTIGATE FOREST FRAGMENTATION EFFECTS ON POPULATION GENETIC DIVERSITY, (2) TO DISENTANGLE THE RELATIVE ROLE OF DEMOGRAPHY (GENETIC DRIFT AND MIGRATION) AND SELECTION, AND (3) TO ASSESS WHETHER IMMUNOGENETIC PATTERNS COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIATION OF ECTOPARASITE (I.E., TICKS) PRESSURES. OUR RESULTS REVEALED AN EROSION OF NEUTRAL GENETIC DIVERSITY AND A SUBSTANTIAL GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION AMONG FRAGMENTED POPULATIONS, RESULTING FROM A DECREASE IN LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY AND LEADING TO THE DIVERGENCE OF DISTINCT GENETIC POOLS AT A SMALL SPATIAL SCALE. PATTERNS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY OBSERVED FOR TLR4 AND TLR5 WERE CONCORDANT WITH NEUTRAL GENETIC PATTERNS, WHEREAS THOSE OBSERVED FOR TLR3 AND TLR21 WERE DISCORDANT. THIS RESULT UNDERLINES THAT THE DOMINANT EVOLUTIONARY FORCE SHAPING IMMUNOGENETIC DIVERSITY (GENETIC DRIFT VS. SELECTION) MAY BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON LOCI CONSIDERED.

USING BIRDS AS AN INDICATOR TAXON, WE EVALUATED THE CONSERVATION VALUE OF A LANDSCAPE MOSAIC IN NORTHEASTERN MADAGASCAR, A BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT AND THE CENTER OF GLOBAL VANILLA PRODUCTION. WE ASSESSED BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION BY CONDUCTING POINT COUNTS ACROSS SEVEN PREVALENT LAND-USE TYPES (FOREST- AND FALLOW-DERIVED VANILLA AGROFORESTS, WOODY AND HERBACEOUS FALLOW THAT ARE PART OF A SHIFTING CULTIVATION SYSTEM, RICE PADDY, FOREST FRAGMENT AND CONTIGUOUS OLD-GROWTH FOREST). WE FIND THAT OLD-GROWTH FOREST HAD THE HIGHEST SPECIES RICHNESS, DRIVEN BY A HIGH SHARE OF ENDEMICS. SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION IN FOREST-DERIVED VANILLA AGROFOREST WERE SIMILAR TO FOREST FRAGMENT, WHEREAS FALLOW-DERIVED VANILLA AGROFOREST WAS MOST COMPARABLE TO WOODY FALLOW. THE OPEN LAND-USE TYPES HERBACEOUS FALLOW AND RICE PADDY HAD FEWEST SPECIES. ACROSS FOREST FRAGMENTS, VANILLA AGROFORESTS, AND WOODY FALLOWS, ENDEMIC BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO LANDSCAPE-SCALE FOREST COVER. WE CONCLUDE THAT BOTH FALLOW- AND FOREST-DERIVED VANILLA AGROFORESTS PLAY AN IMPORTANT BUT CONTRASTING ROLE FOR BIRD CONSERVATION: FALLOW-DERIVED AGROFORESTS ARE LESS VALUABLE BUT TAKE FALLOW LAND OUT OF THE SHIFTING CULTIVATION CYCLE, POSSIBLY PREVENTING FURTHER DEGRADATION. CONVERSELY, FOREST-DERIVED AGROFORESTS CONTRIBUTE TO FOREST DEGRADATION BUT MAY AVOID TOTAL LOSS OF TREE COVER FROM FOREST FRAGMENTS. CONSIDERING THE LAND-USE HISTORY OF AGROFORESTS MAY THUS BE A PROMISING AVENUE FOR FUTURE RESEARCH BEYOND THE CASE OF VANILLA.

WHILE THE EFFECT OF ANTHROPOGENIC SALINISATION ON FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS HAS BEEN INTENSIVELY STUDIED IN RECENT YEARS, MOST STUDIES FOCUS ON SALINISATION EFFECTS ON THE INDIVIDUAL OR SINGLE GROUPS OF ORGANISMS WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE EFFECT ON THE ECOSYSTEM LEVELS, SUCH AS DIVERSITY AND TROPHIC LINKS. THEREFORE, WE CONDUCTED A LONG-TERM FIELD SURVEY FROM MAY 2009 TO AUGUST 2016 AT 405 SITES IN NORTHEAST CHINA TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF A GRADIENT OF SALINISATION ON COMMUNITY DIVERSITY, FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY AND TROPHIC LINKS IN MOUNTAIN STREAMS. SAMPLES OF WATER CHEMISTRY, PERIPHYTON, MACROINVERTEBRATES AND FISH WERE COLLECTED. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT AS ANTHROPOGENIC SALINISATION INCREASED, CA2+, MG2+, HCO3− AND SO42− EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES (P &LT; 0.05). THESE INCREASED IONS CAUSED DECREASES IN TAXONOMIC EVENNESS AND BIOTIC INTEGRITY, BUT AN INCREASE IN THE BETA DIVERSITY FOR PERIPHYTON AND MACROINVERTEBRATES, AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE EVENNESS OF FISH. THE INCREASED SALINISATION RESULTED IN THE EXTIRPATION OF SALT-SENSITIVE TAXA AND DECLINES IN MACROINVERTEBRATE FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS AND FUNCTIONAL REDUNDANCY, WHICH CONSEQUENTLY LED TO SIMPLIFIED TROPHIC LINKS. OUR RESULTS IMPLIED THAT IF SALT-TOLERANT TAXA IN HIGH SALINISATION SITES WERE NOT FUNCTIONALLY REDUNDANT WITH LESS TOLERANT TAXA, ALTERATIONS OF THEIR FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION PROBABLY DECREASE THE STABILITY OF ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS. OVERALL, OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE ONGOING ANTHROPOGENIC SALINISATION IS POSING SERIOUS THREATS TO BIODIVERSITY AND TROPHIC LINKS IN RIVER ECOSYSTEMS, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN FUTURE RIVER RESTORATION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. © 2020",127994,"CALCIUM ION, 14127-61-8; MAGNESIUM ION, 22537-22-0; WATER, 7732-18-5; LEAD, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; LEAD; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL",CMSHA,"ZHANG, Y.; CHINESE RESEARCH ACADEMY OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCESCHINA; EMAIL: ZHANGYUAN@CREAS.ORG.CN; GUO, F.; THE CHINESE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONGHONG KONG; EMAIL: GUOFENSTEPHANIE@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127994,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA, NSFC, 41571050 MAJOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM FOR WATER POLLUTION CONTROL AND TREATMENTMAJOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM FOR WATER POLLUTION CONTROL AND TREATMENT, 2018ZX07601003",456535,CHEMOSPHERE,ENGLISH,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,ELSEVIER LTD,32828062,SCOPUS,"INCREASING ANTHROPOGENIC SALINISATION LEADS TO DECLINES IN COMMUNITY DIVERSITY, FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY AND TROPHIC LINKS IN MOUNTAIN STREAMS",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089495085&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2020.127994&partnerID=40&md5=236c768debbb727d40a0868e4dca2157,263,2021,THIS WORK WAS FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (GRANT NO. 41571050).

THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF FRESHWATER AFFECT BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES AND ECOLOGICAL DYNAMICS THAT DETERMINE BIODIVERSITY, ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY, AND HUMAN HEALTH AND WELFARE AT LOCAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL SCALES. FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED RIPARIAN HABITATS ARE AMONGST THE MOST BIOLOGICALLY DIVERSE ON EARTH, AND HAVE INESTIMABLE ECONOMIC, HEALTH, CULTURAL, SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL VALUES. YET HUMAN IMPACTS TO LAKES, RIVERS, STREAMS, WETLANDS AND GROUNDWATER ARE DRAMATICALLY REDUCING BIODIVERSITY AND ROBBING CRITICAL NATURAL RESOURCES AND SERVICES FROM CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. FRESHWATER BIODIVERSITY IS DECLINING RAPIDLY ON EVERY CONTINENT AND IN EVERY MAJOR RIVER BASIN ON EARTH, AND THIS DEGRADATION IS OCCURRING MORE RAPIDLY THAN IN TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS. CURRENTLY, ABOUT ONE THIRD OF ALL GLOBAL FRESHWATER DISCHARGES PASS THROUGH HUMAN AGRICULTURAL, INDUSTRIAL OR URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE. ABOUT ONE FIFTH OF THE EARTH’S ARABLE LAND IS NOW ALREADY EQUIPPED FOR IRRIGATION, INCLUDING ALL THE MOST PRODUCTIVE LANDS, AND THIS PROPORTION IS PROJECTED TO SURPASS ONE THIRD BY MIDCENTURY TO FEED THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING POPULATIONS OF HUMANS AND COMMENSAL SPECIES, ESPECIALLY POULTRY AND RUMINANT LIVESTOCK. LESS THAN ONE FIFTH OF THE WORLD’S PREINDUSTRIAL FRESHWATER WETLANDS REMAIN, AND THIS PROPORTION IS PROJECTED TO DECLINE TO UNDER ONE TENTH BY MIDCENTURY, WITH IMMINENT THREATS FROM WATER TRANSFER MEGAPROJECTS IN BRAZIL AND INDIA, AND COASTAL WETLAND DRAINAGE MEGAPROJECTS IN CHINA. THE LIVING PLANET INDEX FOR FRESHWATER VERTEBRATE POPULATIONS HAS DECLINED TO JUST ONE THIRD THAT OF 1970, AND IS PROJECTED TO SINK BELOW ONE FIFTH BY MIDCENTURY. A LINEAR MODEL OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC EXPANSION YIELDS THE CHILLING PREDICTION THAT HUMAN UTILIZATION OF CRITICAL FRESHWATER RESOURCES WILL APPROACH ONE HALF OF THE EARTH’S TOTAL CAPACITY BY MIDCENTURY. ALTHOUGH THE MAGNITUDE AND GROWTH OF THE HUMAN FRESHWATER FOOTPRINT ARE GREATER THAN IS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD BY POLICY MAKERS, THE NEWS MEDIA, OR THE GENERAL PUBLIC, SLOWING AND REVERSING DRAMATIC LOSSES OF FRESHWATER SPECIES AND ECOSYSTEMS IS STILL POSSIBLE.

MARINE MEGAFAUNA DISPLAY UNUSUAL COMBINATIONS OF LIFE HISTORY TRAITS. FOR EXAMPLE, RAYS, SHARKS AND TURTLES ARE ALL LONG-LIVED, CHARACTERISTIC OF SLOW LIFE HISTORIES. HOWEVER, TURTLES ALSO HAVE VERY HIGH REPRODUCTION RATES AND JUVENILE MORTALITY, CHARACTERISTIC OF FAST LIFE HISTORIES. SHARKS AND RAYS, IN CONTRAST, PRODUCE A FEW LIVE-BORN YOUNG, WHICH HAVE LOW MORTALITY RATES, CHARACTERISTIC OF SLOW LIFE HISTORIES. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION IF MARINE MEGAFAUNAL RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY FOLLOW CONVENTIONAL LIFE HISTORY PATTERNS, INCLUDING THE PATTERN THAT FAST LIFE HISTORIES ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL AUTOCORRELATION THAN SLOW LIFE HISTORIES. TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, WE USED A FUNCTIONAL TRAIT APPROACH TO QUANTIFY FOR DIFFERENT SPECIES OF MOBULID RAYS, CHELONIID SEA TURTLES AND CARCHARHINID SHARKS – ALL INHABITANTS OR VISITORS OF (HUMAN-DOMINATED) COASTALSCAPES – HOW THEIR LIFE HISTORY, AVERAGE SIZE AND LOG STOCHASTIC POPULATION GROWTH RATE, LOG(ΛS), RESPOND TO CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AUTOCORRELATION AND IN THE FREQUENCY OF FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THE FASTER LIFE HISTORIES WERE MORE SENSITIVE TO TEMPORAL FREQUENCY OF FAVOURABLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, BUT BOTH FASTER AND SLOWER LIFE HISTORIES WERE EQUALLY SENSITIVE, ALTHOUGH OF OPPOSITE SIGN, TO ENVIRONMENTAL AUTOCORRELATION. THESE PATTERNS ARE ATYPICAL, LIKELY FOLLOWING FROM THE UNUSUAL LIFE HISTORY TRAITS THAT THE MEGAFAUNA DISPLAY, AS RESPONSES WERE LINKED TO VARIATION IN MORTALITY, GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION RATES.

AS FOOD FROM THE SEA REPRESENTS ONLY 17% OF THE CURRENT PRODUCTION OF EDIBLE MEAT, WE ASK HOW MUCH FOOD WE CAN EXPECT THE OCEAN TO SUSTAINABLY PRODUCE BY 2050. HERE WE EXAMINE THE MAIN FOOD-PRODUCING SECTORS IN THE OCEAN—WILD FISHERIES, FINFISH MARICULTURE AND BIVALVE MARICULTURE—TO ESTIMATE ‘SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CURVES’ THAT ACCOUNT FOR ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND TECHNOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS. WE OVERLAY THESE SUPPLY CURVES WITH DEMAND SCENARIOS TO ESTIMATE FUTURE SEAFOOD PRODUCTION. WE FIND THAT UNDER OUR ESTIMATED DEMAND SHIFTS AND SUPPLY SCENARIOS (WHICH ACCOUNT FOR POLICY REFORM AND TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS), EDIBLE FOOD FROM THE SEA COULD INCREASE BY 21–44 MILLION TONNES BY 2050, A 36–74% INCREASE COMPARED TO CURRENT YIELDS. THIS REPRESENTS 12–25% OF THE ESTIMATED INCREASE IN ALL MEAT NEEDED TO FEED 9.8 BILLION PEOPLE BY 2050. INCREASES IN ALL THREE SECTORS ARE LIKELY, BUT ARE MOST PRONOUNCED FOR MARICULTURE.

IN 1978, PYLE COINED THE TERM ‘EXTINCTION OF EXPERIENCE’ TO REFLECT THE LOSS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPERIENCE NATURE AS URBANIZATION PROGRESSES. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE OF AN EMOTIONAL DISCONNECT FROM NATURE ARISING FROM AN EXTINCTION OF EXPERIENCE REMAINS POORLY DOCUMENTED. HERE WE REPEAT A STUDY CONDUCTED IN 1996 COMPRISING HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS AND BIRD SURVEYS IN A NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SINGAPORE, ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST DENSELY POPULATED CITIES. WE INVESTIGATE EMPIRICALLY WHETHER EXPERIENCES OF NATURE, OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPERIENCE NATURE AND THE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION BETWEEN PEOPLE AND NATURE HAVE CHANGED ACROSS 22 YEARS. WE DISCOVER THAT EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH NATURE HAS ACTUALLY INCREASED AMONG GREENSPACE USERS AND NON-USERS, WHILE THE FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF GREENSPACE VISITS REMAINED UNCHANGED. AMONG GREENSPACE USERS, THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT NATURE ELEMENTS EXPERIENCED ALSO REMAINED UNCHANGED AND MORE FREQUENT USERS DEMONSTRATED A STRONGER EMOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH NATURE. WE FURTHER FOUND AN INCREASE IN OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPERIENCE LOCAL NATURE, AS MEASURED BY BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE.

PROTECTING LARGE EXTENSIONS OF PRISTINE FOREST IS ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT BIODIVERSITY LOSS, BUT EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL OF ANTHROPOGENIC AREAS IN MAINTAINING BIODIVERSITY IS IMPORTANT IN HIGHLY FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPES. HERE, WE STUDIED THE AVIFAUNA OF PARANÁ SSF IN SEVERAL HABITATS (RE, PRISTINE FOREST CONSIDERED AS REFERENCE SITES; LF, LARGE FOREST FRAGMENTS; MF, MIDDLE-SIZED FOREST FRAGMENTS; SF, SMALL FOREST FRAGMENTS; UF, URBAN FOREST FRAGMENTS; AF, AGRICULTURAL FIELDS; RA, REFORESTATION AREAS) AIMING TO INVESTIGATE WHICH ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE SPECIES IN THIS VEGETATION TYPE. IN ORDER TO DO SO, WE CATEGORIZED EACH SPECIES ACCORDING TO HABITAT SPECIALIZATION, LEVEL OF THREAT, AND LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY TO FOREST FRAGMENTATION. WE ALSO MEASURED THE SIMILARITY IN BIRD SPECIES COMPOSITION AMONG SIX HABITAT CATEGORIES WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE (LF, MF, SF, UF, AF, AND RA). WE RECORDED 368 TERRESTRIAL BIRD SPECIES, OF WHICH 41 WERE CONSIDERED TO BE VULNERABLE DUE TO BEING FOREST SPECIALIST BIRDS THAT WERE ALSO SENSITIVE AND/OR THREATENED. SENSITIVE AND/OR THREATENED SPECIES WERE RARELY FOUND IN UF, AF, AND RA (1–3 SPECIES). THEREFORE, LARGE FORESTS SUCH AS RE ARE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO BIRD SPECIES CONSERVATION. THE SIMILARITY IN BIRD SPECIES COMPOSITION AMONG LF, MF, AND SF INDICATES THAT GENERAL ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF BIRDS COULD BE SIMILAR IN THESE HABITATS, SUGGESTING THAT THE CONSERVATION OF FOREST FRAGMENTS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF BIRD COMMUNITY FUNCTIONALITY IN THE PRESENT PARANÁ SSF. © 2021, SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA.",NA,NA,NA,"TOREZAN, L.F.; LABORATÓRIO DE ORNITOLOGIA E BIOACÚSTICA, BRAZIL; EMAIL: LAUTOREZAN@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1007/s43388-020-00029-8,"COORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIORCOORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIOR, CAPES CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICO, CNPQ, 145462/2018-8, 307643/2018-2, 441540/2016-3",2662673X,ORNITHOLOGY RESEARCH,ENGLISH,NA,NA,2,4,233-240,SPRINGER NATURE,NA,SCOPUS,VULNERABILITY OF BIRD SPECIES IN HIGHLY FRAGMENTED FORESTS OF SOUTHERN BRAZIL: IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099282141&doi=10.1007%2fs43388-020-00029-8&partnerID=40&md5=4720cb3bd8c3b8a6384f4b4fc34fc400,28,2020,"THIS STUDY WAS FUNDED BY CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICO (CNPQ), WHICH PROVIDED AN UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLARSHIP TO L.F.

A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) AND A SET OF NETWORK INDICATORS ARE USED TO INVESTIGATE CITES’S (CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES OF WILD FAUNA AND FLORA) IVORY TRADING DATA FROM 1975 TO 2017. SEVERAL IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS ARE DERIVED: (1) THE SOCIAL NETWORK OF GLOBAL IVORY TRADING IS CLOSELY CONNECTED, WITH AN AVERAGE PATH LENGTH OF 2.643 AND AN AVERAGE CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT OF 0.463. AN AVERAGE OF 45,410.384 KG OF IVORY PRODUCTS WAS TRAFFICKED FROM EACH OF THE 182 COUNTRIES TO AN AVERAGE OF ANOTHER 8.17 COUNTRIES. THE DYNAMIC NETWORKS OF GLOBAL IVORY TRADING SHOW THE PATTERN OF HIGH CONNECTIVITY AND HIGH AGGREGATION. (2) THE USA, THE UK, ZIMBABWE, SOUTH AFRICA, CHINA, JAPAN, SUDAN, BELGIUM AND HONG KONG ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT HUBS IN THE WORLDWIDE IVORY TRADE ACCORDING TO DEGREES AND CENTRALITIES IN THE SNA. (3) ACCORDING TO TRADING WEIGHT DENSITY, THREE SIGNIFICANT IVORY TRAFFICKING ROUTES ARE ILLUSTRATED: 1.

INDONESIAN BIODIVERSITY, IN PARTICULAR, IS INCREASINGLY UNDER SERIOUS THREAT OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AS A RESULT OF THE PREVALENCE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS DEFORESTATION, POACHING, ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE, AND FOREST FIRES. THE OCCURRENCE OF DEFORESTATION IN INDONESIA CAN BE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO TWO MAIN FACTORS: FOREST CONVERSION INTO OIL PALM PLANTATION AND WOOD FIBER PLANTATION. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ADEQUACY OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN INDONESIA IN ADDRESSING BIODIVERSITY LOSS, THE CHALLENGES IT EXPERIENCES AND ANY PROSPECTS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BIODIVERSITY LAWS AND POLICIES. THIS EXAMINATION WILL BE UNDERTAKEN THROUGH THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS OF THE ECOSYSTEM APPROACH, AND POLITICAL ECOLOGY. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGISLATION RELATED TO BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IS HINDERED BY TOP-DOWN APPROACHES AND THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURAL LEGACIES OF PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS WHICH TEND TO FAVOUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AT THE EXPENSE OF ADEQUATE BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION. TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS OF BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION, INDONESIA NOT ONLY NEEDS STRONGER LEGISLATION IN PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY, BUT MUST ADDRESS OTHER FACTORS THAT HINDER THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EFFORTS TO PROTECT BIODIVERSITY. IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE CURRENT PROSPECT OF INITIATIVES AND POLICY REFORMS AIMED AT REDUCING DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REDD+, EACH INITIATIVE HAS PRACTICAL, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL LIMITS. THEREFORE, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE EFFECTIVE COORDINATION OF EACH STRATEGY IS NEEDED.

OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT MANAGEMENT INTENSITY SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTES TO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SPECIES AFTER CLEARCUTTING. WE REVEALED THAT INTENSIVELY MANAGED CLEARINGS CAN MAKE THE DISPERSAL OR FORAGING ACTIVITY OF SMALL MAMMALS DIFFICULT AND HENCE NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE THEIR ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS.

THIS, HOWEVER, CAN PROVE DIFFICULT FOR DATA-LIMITED SPECIES. FOCUSING ON THE LITTLE-STUDIED MAINLAND CLOUDED LEOPARD (NEOFELIS NEBULOSA), A POTENTIAL UMBRELLA SPECIES IN THE REGION, WE DEMONSTRATE AN ACCESSIBLE, FLEXIBLE, AND SCALABLE APPROACH APPLICABLE TO ANY SPECIES. FIRST, WE MODEL THE SPECIES’ RANGE-WIDE LOCAL EXTIRPATION THREAT USING A BAYESIAN BELIEF NETWORK, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DISTRIBUTION OF REMAINING SUITABLE HABITAT AND MAJOR ANTHROPOGENIC THREATS (HABITAT LOSS AND POACHING). WE THEN IDENTIFY REMAINING HABITAT STRONGHOLDS (DEFINED AS LARGE CONTIGUOUS AREAS OF HIGH QUALITY HABITAT WHERE THE SPECIES COULD SURVIVE OVER THE MID-TO-LONG TERM) AND GROUPED THEM INTO STRONGHOLD COMPLEXES, WHICH WE CATEGORIZED BASED ON LOCAL EXTIRPATION THREAT AND RECENT CAMERA-TRAP SURVEY STATUS. OUR RESULTS SHOW A 34% DECLINE IN THE RANGE-WIDE AREA CATEGORIZED AS A STRONGHOLD DUE TO FOREST COVER CHANGES BETWEEN 2000 AND 2018, WITH 80% OF REMAINING STRONGHOLDS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING A HIGH OR VERY HIGH AVERAGE THREAT OF LOCAL EXTIRPATION. BASED ON PUBLISHED RECORDS, ONLY 60% OF REMAINING STRONGHOLDS HAD AT LEAST ONE SITE SURVEYED BY CAMERA-TRAPS IN THE LAST 10 YEARS, HIGHLIGHTING AN IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE GAP CONCERNING THE SPECIES’ CURRENT DISTRIBUTION AND POPULATION STATUS. COMBINED, THE RESULTS OF OUR SURVEY REVIEW AND THREAT ANALYSIS SUGGEST THE SPECIES IS LIKELY EXTIRPATED FROM ALL OF VIETNAM, MOST OF CHINA, AND LARGE PARTS OF CAMBODIA AND LAOS.

WITH FUNDING FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, INCLUDING THE JANE GOODALL INSTITUTE (JGI) AND GRANTS FROM PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS, THE PROJECT HAS CONTINUED FOR SIXTY YEARS, PROVIDING A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EVOLUTIONARY COUSINS. THESE CHIMPANZEES FACE TWO MAIN CHALLENGES TO THEIR SURVIVAL: INFECTIOUS DISEASE — INCLUDING SIMIAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (SIVCPZ), WHICH CAN CAUSE ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) IN CHIMPANZEES — AND THE DEFORESTATION OF LAND OUTSIDE THE PARK. A HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM HAS INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF THE PATHOGENS AFFECTING CHIMPANZEES AND HAS PROMOTED MEASURES TO CHARACTERIZE AND REDUCE DISEASE RISK. DEFORESTATION REDUCES CONNECTIONS BETWEEN GOMBE AND OTHER CHIMPANZEE POPULATIONS, WHICH CAN CAUSE LOSS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY. TO PROMOTE HABITAT RESTORATION, JGI FACILITATED PARTICIPATORY VILLAGE LAND USE PLANNING, IN WHICH COMMUNITIES VOLUNTARILY ALLOCATED LAND TO A NETWORK OF VILLAGE LAND FOREST RESERVES. EXPECTED BENEFITS TO PEOPLE INCLUDE STABILIZING WATERSHEDS, IMPROVING WATER SUPPLIES, AND ENSURING A SUPPLY OF FOREST RESOURCES. SURVEYS AND GENETIC ANALYSES CONFIRM THAT CHIMPANZEES PERSIST ON VILLAGE LANDS AND REMAIN CONNECTED TO THE GOMBE POPULATION. MANY CHALLENGES REMAIN, BUT THE REGENERATION OF NATURAL FOREST ON PREVIOUSLY DEGRADED LANDS PROVIDES HOPE THAT CONSERVATION SOLUTIONS CAN BE FOUND THAT BENEFIT BOTH PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE.

MANY CHALLENGES REMAIN. THE LACK OF DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS AVAILABLE ON SITE, THE LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE FOR KEEPING SAMPLES COLD IN TRANSIT, AND THE LONG DELAY BETWEEN SAMPLE COLLECTION AND TESTING, ARE THE MOST FORMIDABLE BARRIERS. HOWEVER, A NEWLY CONSTRUCTED ON-SITE LABORATORY FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION HAS IMPROVED OUR DIAGNOSTIC CAPACITY. EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO BUILD A MOBILE GENOME SEQUENCING LAB AND DEVELOP LOCAL CAPACITY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MICROSOFT'S PROJECT PREMONITION. THE IUCN BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES FOR GREAT APE HEALTH ( GILARDI ET AL. 2015 ) PROVIDE FURTHER GUIDANCE FOR PROTECTING GOMBE'S WILD PRIMATES FROM HEALTH-RELATED THREATS. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS REEMPHASIZED THESE THREATS. EXTREME PRECAUTIONS, INCLUDING THE TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF RESEARCH, HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED TO SAFEGUARD THE FUTURE OF GOMBE'S WILDLIFE ( GILLESPIE ET AL., 2020 ). ADDITIONAL MEASURES, SUCH AS PROVIDING TREATMENT DURING OUTBREAKS, MAY BE NEEDED. OUTSIDE THE PARK, PARTNERSHIPS MUST BE EXPANDED TO PROMOTE ECOSYSTEM HEALTH MORE BROADLY. FINALLY, TO ENSURE THE CONSERVATION OF WILDLIFE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO BUILD LOCAL CAPACITY FOR VETERINARY HEALTH. TO DATE, THE PROJECT HAS TRAINED THREE TANZANIAN VETERINARIANS SPECIALIZED IN GREAT APE HEALTH, AND HAS PROVIDED ADVANCED TRAINING IN LABORATORY AND RESEARCH TECHNIQUES TO SEVERAL OTHER STAFF. WHILE TACARE SUCCEEDED IN MANY RESPECTS, ITS EFFORTS TO PROMOTE REFORESTATION COULD NOT KEEP PACE WITH RAPID HUMAN POPULATION GROWTH. ANALYSIS OF AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATED THAT THE DEFORESTATION RATE IN AREAS IMPORTANT FOR CHIMPANZEES DOUBLED FROM 87.5 HA/YEAR (1972?1991) TO 171 HA/YEAR (1991?2003) (ANDERSON ET AL. 2004). STARTING IN 2005, JGI THEREFORE ADOPTED A NEW APPROACH FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTING TANZANIAN POLICIES THAT EMPOWERED VILLAGE GOVERNMENTS TO MANAGE THEIR LAND, WITH SUPPORT FROM THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID). VILLAGE LAND USE PLANNING PROVIDED A MECHANISM TO SET ASIDE LAND TO RESTORE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES WHILE SECURING LAND TENURE FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, CLEARLY DEFINING THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PARK, VILLAGE LAND, AND VILLAGE FOREST RESERVES. THESE PLANS WERE IMPLEMENTED WITH FULL INVOLVEMENT OF GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS (PINTEA ET AL. 2016). JGI DID NOT DIRECT THE LAND-USE PLANNING, BUT INSTEAD FACILITATED IT BY PROVIDING FINANCIAL, LOGISTIC AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT, INCLUDING ACCESS TO MAPS AND GEOSPATIAL TOOLS TO RECORD AND MANAGE SPATIAL DATA. THE PLANNING PROCESS FOLLOWED SIX STEPS AND REQUIRED VILLAGERS TO SETTLE ANY EXISTING LAND DISAGREEMENTS AND AGREE ON VILLAGE BOUNDARIES AND HOW THEIR LAND SHOULD BE USED TO MEET SPECIFIC HUMAN LIVELIHOOD NEEDS AND CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES. BY 2009, 13 VILLAGES HAD COMPLETED THEIR LAND-USE PLANS, ASSIGNING 26% OF THEIR VILLAGE AREA (96.9 KM2) TO VILLAGE LAND FOREST RESERVES (VLFRS) (PINTEA ET AL. 2012), WHICH INCLUDE AN AREA NOW DESIGNATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS THE NORTH OF GOMBE WILDLIFE CORRIDOR. COVERING 2.7 TIMES AS MUCH LAND AS THE PARK'S 35.69 KM2, THE VLFRS REPRESENT A MAJOR STEP TOWARDS SECURING THE FUTURE FOR GOMBE'S CHIMPANZEES.WE THANK RICHARD PRIMACK AND REINMAR SEIDLER FOR THE INVITATION TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS SPECIAL ISSUE.

MOST LOSSES HAVE BEEN ON PRIVATE LAND, SO RELYING ON NATIONAL PARKS AND RESERVES IS NOT ENOUGH TO REVERSE TRENDS AND MEET AUSTRALIA'S RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A MODEL THAT COULD INCREASE ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF AUSTRALIA'S BIODIVERSITY, WHILE PROVIDING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO PRIVATE LANDHOLDERS TO DO SO. IT ADDRESSES THE QUESTION, CAN LANDHOLDER MANAGEMENT OF WILDLIFE, AND A FORM OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP, REMEDY SHORTFALLS IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND THE RESULTING CONSEQUENCES OF VAST BIODIVERSITY LOSSES? LANDHOLDERS CURRENTLY INVEST IN PROPAGATING INTRODUCED LIVESTOCK SPECIES, BUT THEY ARE PREVENTED BY CURRENT REGULATIONS FROM INVESTING IN A SIMILAR MANNER IN THREATENED AUSTRALIAN NATIVE SPECIES. MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES COULD INCREASE THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF SPECIES ON PRIVATE LAND AND HELP PROTECT THE HABITAT OF OTHER BIODIVERSITY. THE ENABLING CHANGES WOULD BE CONTENTIOUS TO SOME PEOPLE BUT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF NATURE'S SUSTAINABLE USE POLICY. DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF WILDLIFE PRIVATISATION HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED INTERNATIONALLY: THERE IS URGENCY FOR AUSTRALIA TO DRAW ON THESE EXPERIENCES AND DEVELOP ITS OWN MODEL TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT WILDLIFE ON PRIVATE FREEHOLD LAND. THE MODEL PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON: IDENTIFYING LOCALLY OVERABUNDANT POPULATIONS OR CAPTIVE-BRED POPULATIONS AS SOURCES OF SUPPLY FINDING LANDHOLDERS AND PHILANTHROPISTS WHO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE CUSTODIANSHIP OF SPECIES; ENABLING ENTREPRENEURS TO RESPOND TO DEMAND AND BRINGING THE TWO TOGETHER WHERE THERE IS SCOPE FOR A MARKET-BASED SHARING ECONOMY. ENCOURAGING WILDLIFE CUSTODIANSHIP ON PRIVATE FREEHOLD LAND WOULD BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL, AS IT WOULD NOT ONLY RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN BIODIVERSITY, BUT THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF WILDLIFE COULD PROVIDE AN INCOME TO LANDHOLDERS AS WELL AS ENHANCING AUSTRALIA'S CONSERVATION SYSTEM. © 2020 JOURNAL COMPILATION",NA,NA,NA,"WILSON, G.; AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: GEORGE.WILSON@ANU.EDU.AU",ARTICLE,10.1071/RJ20039,NA,10369872,RANGELAND JOURNAL,ENGLISH,NA,NA,3,5,309-321,CSIRO,NA,SCOPUS,CUSTODIANSHIP OF WILDLIFE ON PRIVATE LAND TO SUPPORT CONSERVATION-AN AUSTRALIAN MODEL,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094820169&doi=10.1071%2fRJ20039&partnerID=40&md5=8c5f2b4a62ffa5865c4c36fad0b3f0a3,42,2020,NA NA NA,RANGELAND J,none,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF CANBERRA,NOTREPORTED;AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED,NA,"WILSON G, 2020, RANGELAND J","WILSON G, 2020, RANGELAND J"

SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS (SDMS) CAN HELP IDENTIFY CRITICAL HABITAT FOR RESERVE DESIGN AND SELECTION, AND HAVE QUICKLY ADVANCED TO THE FORE OF ECOLOGICAL INQUIRY. SUCH MODELS ARE TYPICALLY DOMINATED BY ABIOTIC FACTORS, FOLLOWING THE ELTONIAN NOISE HYPOTHESIS (ENH) THAT PHYSICAL FEATURES SET THE LIMITS OF SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS. NEVERTHELESS, RECENT STUDIES CHALLENGE THIS NOTION AND HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF BIOTIC INTERACTIONS. RESOLVING THIS DISCREPANCY COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING. TO TEST THESE IDEAS, WE BUILT DISTRIBUTION MODELS FOR TWO LARGE HERBIVORES, MUSKOXEN (OVIBOS MUSCHATUS) AND PEARY CARIBOU (RANGIFER TARANDUS PEARYI), SYSTEMATICALLY OBSERVED ACROSS A VAST SPATIAL EXTENT – 65 ISLANDS SPANNING 800,000 KM2 IN THE CANADIAN HIGH ARCTIC. TO TEST THE ENH WE FIT SDMS WITH TWO SETS OF PREDICTORS: (1) ABIOTIC ONLY (I.E. TOPOGRAPHIC, CLIMATIC) AND (2) ABIOTIC + BIOTIC (I.E. VEGETATION COMMUNITIES, DISTANCE-TO-HETEROSPECIFICS). WE EVALUATED THESE MODELS AND SPATIALLY ESTIMATED HABITAT SUITABILITY FOR EACH SPECIES. WE FOUND BOTH SETS OF MODELS HAD GOOD PREDICTIVE ABILITY, ALTHOUGH BIOTIC VARIABLES (I.E. PROPORTION OF GRASS-LICHEN-MOSS) IMPROVED MODEL PERFORMANCE AND SUBSTANTIALLY NARROWED AREAS OF HIGH HABITAT SUITABILITY. NICHE OVERLAP BETWEEN CARIBOU AND MUSKOXEN WAS MODERATE AND HIGHLY SUITABLE AREAS WERE SPATIALLY DISJUNCT BETWEEN SPECIES AND LARGELY OUTSIDE PROTECTED AREAS. THESE RESULTS FAIL TO SUPPORT THE ENH. OUR STUDY IMPLIES THAT BIOTIC FEATURES, ALTHOUGH OFTEN OVERLOOKED, MAY BE IMPORTANT TO THE PERFORMANCE OF SDMS AND VITAL IN IDENTIFYING PRIORITY AREAS FOR CONSERVATION. FOR THESE LARGE HERBIVORES, REFLECTING TROPHIC INTERACTIONS IN SDMS WAS ESSENTIAL WHEN ESTIMATING AREAS OF CONSERVATION VALUE.

OVER 60% OF NORTH AMERICAN GRASSLAND AND ARIDLANDS HAVE BEEN LOST SINCE THE 1800S. BIRDS IN THESE HABITATS ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPERILLED IN NORTH AMERICA, YET MOST REMAINING HABITATS ARE UNPROTECTED. DESPITE THE NEED TO MEASURE IMPACT, CONSERVATION EFFORTS ON PRIVATE AND WORKING LANDS ARE RARELY EVALUATED, DUE IN PART TO LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF SUITABLE METHODS. LOCATION: NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS OF NORTH AMERICA. METHODS: WE DEVELOPED A NOVEL METRIC TO EVALUATE GRASSLAND AND ARIDLAND BIRD COMMUNITY RESPONSE TO HABITAT MANAGEMENT, THE BIRD-FRIENDLINESS INDEX (BFI), CONSISTING OF DENSITY ESTIMATES OF GRASSLAND AND ARIDLAND BIRDS WEIGHTED BY CONSERVATION NEED AND A FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY METRIC TO INCORPORATE RESILIENCY. WE USED THE BFI TO IDENTIFY ECOLOGICALLY SIGNIFICANT AREAS FOR GRASSLAND AND ARIDLAND BIRDS AND COMPARED THEM WITH OTHER PRIORITIZATIONS. THEN, WE USED THE BFI TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF SIMULATED HABITAT MANAGEMENT ON GRASSLAND AND ARIDLAND BIRD COMMUNITIES. RESULTS: THE MOST RESILIENT BIRD COMMUNITIES WERE FOUND IN THE PRAIRIE POTHOLES REGION OF ALBERTA, SASKATCHEWAN AND NORTH DAKOTA AND THE LOWEST BFI VALUES IN THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN REGIONS OF THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS. BFI VALUES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN AREAS INCLUDED IN ONE OR MORE PRIORITIZATION, AND INCREASED WITH THE NUMBER OF PRIORITIZATIONS AN AREA WAS INCLUDED WITHIN. BFI VALUES INCREASED IN RESPONSE TO SIMULATED BIRD-FRIENDLY HABITAT MANAGEMENT. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PRACTICES RECOMMENDED FOR USE IN BIRD-FRIENDLY GRASSLAND HABITAT MANAGEMENT PLANS WILL INCREASE THE ABUNDANCE AND RESILIENCE OF THE GRASSLAND AND ARIDLAND BIRD COMMUNITY AND THAT BIRD COMMUNITY RESPONSES TO MANAGEMENT WILL BE DETECTED USING THE BFI. THE BFI IS A TOOL BY WHICH CONSERVATIONISTS AND MANAGERS CAN CARRY OUT ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABLE CONSERVATION NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

DESPITE MUCH EVIDENCE OF CATASTROPHIC DECLINES, FEW AUSTRALIAN SPECIES ARE LISTED AS THREATENED UNDER NATIONAL LEGISLATION. WE AIM TO HELP REDRESS THIS BY IDENTIFYING THE AUSTRALIAN FRESHWATER FISHES THAT ARE IN THE MOST IMMEDIATE RISK OF EXTINCTION. FOR 22 FRESHWATER FISHES (IDENTIFIED AS HIGHLY THREATENED BY EXPERTS), WE USED STRUCTURED EXPERT ELICITATION TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY OF EXTINCTION IN THE NEXT ∼20 YEARS, AND TO IDENTIFY KEY THREATS AND PRIORITY MANAGEMENT NEEDS. ALL BUT ONE OF THE 22 SPECIES ARE SMALL (<150 MM TOTAL LENGTH), 12 HAVE BEEN FORMALLY DESCRIBED ONLY IN THE LAST DECADE, WITH SEVEN AWAITING DESCRIPTION. OVER 90% OF THESE SPECIES WERE ASSESSED TO HAVE A >50% PROBABILITY OF EXTINCTION IN THE NEXT ∼20 YEARS. COLLECTIVELY, THE BIGGEST FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF EXTINCTION OF THE FRESHWATER FISHES CONSIDERED IS THAT THEY OCCUR IN SMALL (DISTRIBUTIONS ≤44 KM2), GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED POPULATIONS, AND ARE THREATENED BY A MIX OF PROCESSES (PARTICULARLY ALIEN FISHES AND CLIMATE CHANGE). NINETEEN OF THESE SPECIES ARE UNLISTED ON NATIONAL LEGISLATION, SO LEGISLATIVE DRIVERS FOR RECOVERY ACTIONS ARE LARGELY ABSENT. RESEARCH HAS PROVIDED STRONG DIRECTION ON HOW TO MANAGE ∼35% OF KNOWN THREATS TO THE SPECIES CONSIDERED, AND, OF THESE, ∼36% OF THREATS HAVE SOME MANAGEMENT UNDERWAY (ALTHOUGH VIRTUALLY NONE ARE AT THE STAGE WHERE INTERVENTION IS NO LONGER REQUIRED).

RESTORATION STRATEGIES TYPICALLY FOCUS ON PROMOTING BIODIVERSITY BUT OFTEN NEGLECT THAT LAND-USE INTENSIFICATION COULD HAVE CHANGED THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY. SINCE ASSEMBLY MECHANISMS DETERMINE THE DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION OF COMMUNITIES, WE PROPOSE THAT EVALUATION OF RESTORATION STRATEGIES SHOULD CONSIDER EFFECTS OF RESTORATION ON BIODIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY. USING A MULTI-TAXON APPROACH, WE TESTED WHETHER A STRATEGY THAT PROMOTES FOREST BIODIVERSITY BY RESTORING DEADWOOD HABITATS ALSO AFFECTS ASSEMBLY PATTERNS. WE ASSESSED SAPROXYLIC (I.E. DEADWOOD-DEPENDENT) BEETLES AND FUNGI, AS WELL AS NON-SAPROXYLIC PLANTS AND BIRDS IN 68 BEECH FOREST PLOTS IN SOUTHERN GERMANY, 8 YEARS AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF A RESTORATION PROJECT. TO ASSESS CHANGES IN COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY, WE ANALYSED THE PATTERNS OF FUNCTIONAL–PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY, COMMUNITY-WEIGHTED MEAN (CWM) TRAITS AND THEIR DIVERSITY. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT RESTORATION INCREASES HABITAT AMOUNT AND HETEROGENEITY OF DEADWOOD AND REDUCES CANOPY COVER AND THEREBY DECREASES THE STRENGTH OF ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERS IMPOSED BY PAST SILVICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, SUCH AS A LOW AMOUNT IN DEADWOOD. WITH THE RESTORATION OF DEADWOOD HABITATS, SAPROXYLIC BEETLE COMMUNITIES BECAME LESS FUNCTIONALLY–PHYLOGENETICALLY SIMILAR, WHEREAS THE ASSEMBLY PATTERNS OF SAPROXYLIC FUNGI AND NON-SAPROXYLIC TAXA REMAINED UNAFFECTED BY DEADWOOD RESTORATION. AMONG THE TRAITS ANALYSED, DEADWOOD DIAMETER NICHE POSITION OF SPECIES WAS MOST STRONGLY AFFECTED INDICATING THAT THE ENRICHMENT OF LARGE DEADWOOD OBJECTS LED TO LOWER FUNCTIONAL–PHYLOGENETICAL SIMILARITY OF SAPROXYLIC BEETLES. COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY AND TRAITS OF PLANTS WERE MAINLY INFLUENCED BY MICROCLIMATE ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN CANOPY COVER. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF DEADWOOD RESTORATION ON SAPROXYLIC BEETLE RICHNESS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN DEADWOOD AMOUNT. THIS MIGHT BE LINKED TO AN INCREASE IN DEADWOOD HETEROGENEITY, AND THEREFORE DECREASING MANAGEMENT-INDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERS. DEADWOOD ENRICHMENT CAN THUS BE CONSIDERED AN EFFECTIVE RESTORATION STRATEGY WHICH REDUCES THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF INTENSE FOREST MANAGEMENT ON SAPROXYLIC TAXA BY NOT ONLY PROMOTING BIODIVERSITY BUT ALSO BY DECREASING THE ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERS SHAPING SAPROXYLIC BEETLE COMMUNITIES, THUS ALLOWING THE POSSIBLY FOR MORE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SPECIES AND A HIGHER FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

IN AGROECOSYSTEMS THAT VARY IN MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, QUANTIFYING CHANGES IN ECOLOGICAL NETWORK STRUCTURE ACROSS GRADIENTS OF LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION CAN INFORM BOTH THE ECOLOGY AND FUNCTION OF PRODUCTIVE AGROECOSYSTEMS. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINED NATURAL-ENEMY–HERBIVORE CO-OCCURRENCE NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH BRASSICA OLERACEA (COLE CROPS), A COMMON CROP IN URBAN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS. SPECIFICALLY, WE INVESTIGATED HOW LOCAL MANAGEMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF URBAN COMMUNITY GARDENS AND THE LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AROUND THEM AFFECT (1) THE ABUNDANCE OF B. OLERACEA HERBIVORES AND THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES, (2) THE NATURAL-ENEMY : HERBIVORE RATIO, AND (3) NATURAL-ENEMY–HERBIVORE CO-OCCURRENCE NETWORK METRICS. WE SAMPLED HERBIVORES AND NATURAL ENEMIES IN B. OLERACEA PLANTS IN 24 VEGETABLE GARDENS IN THE CALIFORNIA, USA CENTRAL COAST REGION. WE ALSO COLLECTED INFORMATION ON GARDEN CHARACTERISTICS AND LAND-USE COVER OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE (2 KM RADIUS). WE FOUND THAT INCREASED FLORAL RICHNESS AND B. OLERACEA ABUNDANCE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED PARASITOID ABUNDANCE, NON-APHID HERBIVORE ABUNDANCE, AND INCREASED NETWORK VULNERABILITY; INCREASED VEGETATION COMPLEXITY SUPPRESSED PARASITOID ABUNDANCE, BUT STILL BOOSTED NETWORK VULNERABILITY. HIGH AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE COVER IN THE LANDSCAPE SURROUNDING URBAN GARDENS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER PREDATOR, PARASITOID, AND NON-APHID HERBIVORE ABUNDANCE, LOWER NATURAL-ENEMY : HERBIVORE RATIOS, LOWER INTERACTION RICHNESS, AND HIGHER TROPHIC COMPLEMENTARITY. WHILE WE DID NOT DIRECTLY MEASURE PEST CONTROL, HIGHER INTERACTION RICHNESS, HIGHER VULNERABILITY, AND LOWER TROPHIC COMPLEMENTARITY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PEST CONTROL SERVICES IN OTHER AGROECOSYSTEMS. THUS, IF GARDENS FUNCTION SIMILARLY TO OTHER AGROECOSYSTEMS, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT INCREASING VEGETATION COMPLEXITY, INCLUDING TREES, SHRUBS, AND PLANT RICHNESS, ESPECIALLY WITHIN GARDENS LOCATED IN INTENSIVELY FARMED LANDSCAPES, COULD POTENTIALLY ENHANCE THE BIODIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF NATURAL ENEMIES, SUPPORTING ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PEST CONTROL SERVICES. © 2020 BY THE ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA",E02201,NA,ECAPE,"PHILPOTT, S.M.; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES DEPARTMENT, 1156 HIGH STREET, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: SPHILPOT@UCSC.EDU",ARTICLE,10.1002/eap.2201,"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREU.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, USDA, 2016‐67019‐25185 UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIAUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, UC",10510761,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,ENGLISH,NA,NA,6,8,NA,ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,32578260,SCOPUS,NATURAL ENEMY–HERBIVORE NETWORKS ALONG LOCAL MANAGEMENT AND LANDSCAPE GRADIENTS IN URBAN AGROECOSYSTEMS,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088579666&doi=10.1002%2feap.2201&partnerID=40&md5=8a34758f05e5946554a687852f3668e2,30,2020,"WE THANK H.

USING TRADITIONAL COPROSCOPIC PARASITOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES, WE COMPARED THE GASTROINTESTINAL PROTOZOAN AND METAZOAN SYMBIONT RICHNESS OF TWO PRIMATES: THE UDZUNGWA RED COLOBUS (PROCOLOBUS GORDONORUM) AND THE YELLOW BABOON (PAPIO CYNOCEPHALUS). THESE SPECIES LIVE SYMPATRICALLY IN BOTH PROTECTED AND UNPROTECTED FORESTS WITHIN THE UDZUNGWA MOUNTAINS OF TANZANIA WITH DISTINCT ECOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS AND DIETS. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT TERRESTRIAL AND OMNIVOROUS YELLOW BABOONS HAD 2 (95% CI 1.47–2.73) AND 3.78 (2.62–5.46) TIMES HIGHER GUT SYMBIONT RICHNESS (BOTH INCLUDING AND EXCLUDING RARE PROTOZOANS) COMPARED TO THE ARBOREAL AND LEAF-EATING UDZUNGWA RED COLOBUS IN UNPROTECTED AND PROTECTED FOREST, RESPECTIVELY. WE ALSO FOUND A CONSISTENT DEPLETION OF SYMBIONT RICHNESS IN RED COLOBUS LIVING IN THE UNPROTECTED FOREST FRAGMENT COMPARED TO THE CONTINUOUS PROTECTED FORESTS [THE LATTER HAVING 1.97 TIMES (95% CI 1.33–2.92) HIGHER RICHNESS], BUT NOT IN YELLOW BABOONS. RICHNESS REDUCTION WAS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT IN THE UDZUNGWA RED COLOBUS MONKEYS, CONFIRMING THE PATTERN WE REPORTED PREVIOUSLY FOR GUT BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE IMPACT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES EVEN ON THE MICROBIODIVERSITY OF THE INTESTINAL TRACT OF THIS SPECIES.

FURTHER, WE PREDICTED THAT REGARDLESS OF WINTER SEVERITY, DEER DISTRIBUTION WOULD PERSIST AND BE BEST EXPLAINED BY EARLY SERAL FORAGE SUBSIDIES FROM EXTENSIVE LANDSCAPE CHANGE VIA RESOURCE EXTRACTION.

AS WITH SIMILAR NETWORK-BASED CRIMES, INSTITUTIONS ARE FREQUENTLY INEFFECTIVE AT CURBING WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING, PARTLY DUE TO THE LACK OF INFORMATION DETAILING ACTIVITIES WITHIN ILLICIT TRADING NETWORKS. TO ADDRESS THIS SHORTCOMING, WE LEVERAGE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT RECORDS DOCUMENTING THE ILLEGAL TRADE OF REPTILES IN COLOMBIA. AS SUCH, OUR STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW AND WHY WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING PERSISTS ACROSS ROBUST TRAFFICKING NETWORKS, WHICH ARE CONDUITS FOR A BROADER RANGE OF BLACK-MARKET GOODS. LEVERAGING GEO-SPATIAL DATA, WE CONSTRUCT A MULTIPLEX REPRESENTATION OF WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING NETWORKS, WHICH FACILITATES IDENTIFYING NETWORK PROPERTIES THAT ARE SIGNATURES OF STRATEGIC TRAFFICKER BEHAVIOR. IN PARTICULAR, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT TRAFFICKERS’ ACTIONS ARE CONSTRAINED BY SPATIAL AND MARKET CUSTOMS, A RESULT WHICH IS APPARENT ONLY WITHIN AN INTEGRATED MULTIPLEX REPRESENTATION. CHARACTERISTIC LEVELS OF SUB-NETWORK COUPLING FURTHER INDICATE THAT TRAFFICKERS STRATEGICALLY LEVERAGE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. WE ARGUE THAT THIS MULTIPLEX REPRESENTATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR PRIORITIZING CRIME ENFORCEMENT STRATEGIES AIMED AT DISRUPTING ROBUST TRADE NETWORKS, THEREBY ENHANCING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND RESOURCES ALLOCATION OF INSTITUTIONS CHARGED WITH CURBING ILLICIT TRAFFICKING. WE DEVELOP A GENERALIZABLE MODEL OF MULTIPLEX CRIMINAL TRADE NETWORKS SUITABLE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH POLICY MAKERS AND PRACTITIONERS, THEREBY FACILITATING RAPID TRANSLATION INTO PUBLIC POLICY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION EFFORTS. © 2020, THE AUTHOR(S).",20,NA,NA,"ARROYAVE, F.J.; ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: FJARROYAVEB@UNAL.EDU.CO",ARTICLE,10.1007/s41109-020-00262-6,"UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DE COLOMBIAUNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DE COLOMBIA, UNAL, HERMES 19010",23648228,APPLIED NETWORK SCIENCE,ENGLISH,NA,NA,6,1,NA,SPRINGER,NA,SCOPUS,MULTIPLEX NETWORKS REVEAL GEOGRAPHIC CONSTRAINTS ON ILLICIT WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082940925&doi=10.1007%2fs41109-020-00262-6&partnerID=40&md5=1af424cc249ca5c948b2aeaa8c5b35d2,5,2020,"WE THANK UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DE COLOMBIA FOR THEY SUPPORT.

ASSEMBLAGES IN DITCHES ARE REGULARLY DISTURBED BY DITCH MAINTENANCE, BUT THE EXTENT OF THESE DISTURBANCES AND MITIGATION POSSIBILITIES ARE POORLY DOCUMENTED. WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY IN THREE COMMERCIALLY MANAGED FOREST PLOTS IN EASTERN ESTONIA, AIMING TO FIND OUT HOW DITCH NETWORK MAINTENANCE (DNM) AFFECTS THE DIVERSITY AND ASSEMBLAGES OF AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATES IN DITCHES AND REMNANT POOLS, AND WHETHER THIS EFFECT CAN BE ALLEVIATED BY CONSTRUCTING MITIGATION WATERBODIES. FOR COMPARISON WE ALSO COLLECTED DATA FROM NATURAL POOLS IN THREE UNDRAINED FOREST PLOTS. BEFORE DNM, DITCHES SUPPORTED GREATER NUMBER OF HIGHER TAXA COMPARED TO REMNANT AND NATURAL POOLS AND MORE STRICTLY AQUATIC TAXA, WHEREAS NATURAL POOLS IN UNDRAINED PLOTS SUPPORTED MORE TRICHOPTERA SHREDDERS. AFTER DNM, THE DIVERSITY IN REMNANT POOLS DECREASED. MOREOVER, MAJORITY OF THE POOLS DRIED OUT, WHICH RESULTED IN FURTHER REDUCTION OF THE RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF MACROINVERTEBRATES. IN DITCHES THE DIVERSITY DROPPED IMMEDIATELY AFTER DNM, BUT RECOVERED IN TWO TO THREE YEARS. NEVERTHELESS, PLOT-SCALE RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE DID NOT COMPLETELY RECOVER. ASSEMBLAGE SHIFT IN DITCHES TOOK PLACE RIGHT AFTER DNM AND REMAINED DISTINCT AFTER THE FOUR YEAR SURVEY PERIOD. MITIGATION POOLS PROVIDED HABITAT FOR SEVERAL TAXA (ESPECIALLY ODONATA) UNCOMMON IN OTHER WATERBODIES IN DRAINED AND UNDRAINED PLOTS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT DNM IN FORESTS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPOVERISHES HABITAT AVAILABILITY AND REDUCES THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATES.

HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE CONSENSUS ON WHETHER AN ACTIVE OR A PASSIVE RESTORATION STRATEGY IS MORE SUCCESSFUL FOR RECOVERING BIODIVERSITY BECAUSE FEW STUDIES MAKE ADEQUATE COMPARISONS. FURTHERMORE, STUDIES ON ANIMAL RESPONSES TO RESTORATION ARE SCARCE COMPARED TO THOSE ON PLANTS, AND THOSE THAT ASSESS FAUNAL RECOVERY OFTEN FOCUS ON A SINGLE TAXON, LIMITING THE GENERALIZATION OF RESULTS. WE ASSESSED THE SUCCESS OF ACTIVE (NATIVE MIXED-SPECIES PLANTATIONS) AND PASSIVE (NATURAL REGENERATION) TROPICAL CLOUD FOREST RESTORATION STRATEGIES BASED ON THE RESPONSES OF THREE ANIMAL TAXA: AMPHIBIANS, ANTS, AND DUNG BEETLES. WE COMPARED COMMUNITY ATTRIBUTES OF THESE THREE TAXA IN A 23-YEAR-OLD ACTIVE RESTORATION FOREST, A 23-YEAR-OLD PASSIVE RESTORATION FOREST, A CATTLE PASTURE, AND A MATURE FOREST, WITH EMPHASIS ON FOREST-SPECIALIST SPECIES. WE ALSO EVALUATED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FAUNAL RECOVERY AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES. FOR ALL TAXA, WE FOUND THAT RECOVERY OF SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION WERE SIMILAR IN ACTIVE AND PASSIVE RESTORATION SITES. HOWEVER, RECOVERY OF FOREST SPECIALISTS WAS ENHANCED THROUGH ACTIVE RESTORATION. FOR BOTH FORESTS UNDER RESTORATION, SIMILARITY IN SPECIES COMPOSITION OF ALL FAUNAL GROUPS WAS 60–70% WITH RESPECT TO THE REFERENCE ECOSYSTEM DUE TO A REPLACEMENT OF GENERALIST SPECIES BY FOREST-SPECIALIST SPECIES. THE RECOVERY OF FAUNAL COMMUNITIES WAS MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH CANOPY AND LEAF LITTER COVERS. WE RECOMMEND IMPLEMENTING ACTIVE RESTORATION USING MIXED PLANTATIONS OF NATIVE TREE SPECIES AND, WHENEVER POSSIBLE, SELECTING SITES CLOSE TO MATURE FOREST TO ACCELERATE THE RECOVERY OF TROPICAL CLOUD FOREST BIODIVERSITY. AS ACTIVE RESTORATION IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN PASSIVE RESTORATION, BOTH STRATEGIES MIGHT BE USED IN A COMPLEMENTARY MANNER AT THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL TO COMPENSATE FOR HIGH IMPLEMENTATION COSTS. © 2020 DÍAZ-GARCÍA ET AL.

IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND OTHER TROPICAL REGIONS, WILDLIFE POPULATIONS ARE BEING ISOLATED INTO POCKETS OF NATURAL HABITAT SURROUNDED BY ROAD NETWORKS AND MONOCULTURE PLANTATIONS. MORTALITY FROM WILDLIFE–VEHICLE COLLISIONS (WVCS) IS CONTRIBUTING TO A DECLINE IN MANY SPECIES OF CONSERVATION PRIORITY IN HUMAN-MODIFIED LANDSCAPES. THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST IN MALAYSIA TO INVESTIGATE FACTORS AFFECTING THE OCCURRENCE OF WVCS. WE ASSESSED ROADKILL DATA GATHERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WILDLIFE AND NATIONAL PARKS ON SMALL-, MEDIUM-, AND LARGE-SIZED MAMMALS IN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA. WE EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WILDLIFE ROAD ACCIDENTS AND SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. WE FOUND A TOTAL OF 605 ROADKILL ANIMALS, INVOLVING 21 SPECIES, WHICH INCLUDED THREE SPECIES CLASSIFIED AS ENDANGERED. ROAD TYPE (PLANTATION ROAD OR HIGHWAY), YEAR, AND DISTANCE OF THE ROAD FROM CONTINUOUS AND FRAGMENTED FORESTS WERE SIGNIFICANT IN DETERMINING MAMMAL MORTALITY. UNEXPECTEDLY, THE MAJORITY OF ROAD MORTALITY OCCURRED ON PALM OIL PLANTATION ROADS COMPARED TO HIGHWAYS. MORTALITY OF SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED MAMMALS WAS GREATER AT LOCATIONS FURTHER FROM CONTINUOUS FOREST THAN THOSE CLOSER TO FRAGMENTED FORESTS.

THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT LEGAL PROTECTION REDUCES LOSS OF NATURAL VEGETATION, BUT BIODIVERSITY LOSS CAN STILL HAPPEN WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN VEGETATION COVER. HERE WE USE DATA FROM A SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED CAMERA TRAP SURVEY TO CONDUCT A COUNTERFACTUAL ASSESSMENT OF PA EFFECTIVENESS AT SAFEGUARDING LOCAL BIODIVERSITY IN THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO. WE SURVEYED THE MAMMAL COMMUNITY IN 517 LOCATIONS AT THE SERTÃO VEREDAS-PERUAÇU MOSAIC, DISTRIBUTED ACROSS FIVE STRICT PAS (264 SURVEY SITES IN FIVE ARRAYS) AND TWO MULTIPLE-USE PAS WITH LOW MANAGEMENT LEVELS (253 SURVEY SITES IN FOUR ARRAYS). WE ADOPTED A MULTI-SPECIES OCCUPANCY FRAMEWORK TO ANALYSE OUR DATASET WHILE ALSO CONTROLLING FOR CONFOUNDING FACTORS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO PROTECTION. OF THE 21 SPECIES ASSESSED, NINE HAD HIGHER OCCUPANCY IN STRICT PAS, ONE HAD HIGHER OCCUPANCY IN MULTIPLE-USE PAS, AND TEN DID NOT RESPOND TO PROTECTION LEVEL. SITE SPECIES RICHNESS WAS NEARLY TWICE AS LARGE IN AREAS UNDER STRICTER PROTECTION, WITH EVEN GREATER DIFFERENCES FOR SPECIES RICHNESS OF GLOBALLY THREATENED AND LARGER MAMMALS (>15 KG). OVERALL WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE STRICT PAS SURVEYED SUPPORT HIGHER MAMMAL DIVERSITY THAN SIMILAR AREAS UNDER LESS RESTRICTIVE MANAGEMENT, WITH A PARTICULAR STRONG EFFECT ON LARGER AND THREATENED SPECIES. GIVEN THAT STRICT PAS COVER ONLY 3% OF THE CERRADO, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT EXPANDING THE AREA UNDER STRICT PROTECTION IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT ICONIC SPECIES OF THE BRAZILIAN SAVANNA, SUCH AS THE MANED WOLF AND GIANT ANTEATER. © 2020 ELSEVIER LTD",108762,NA,BICOB,"FERREIRA, G.B.; CENTRE FOR BIODIVERSITY AND ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH, GOWER STREET, UNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: GUILHERME.FERREIRA.14@UCL.AC.UK",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108762,"207195/2014-5 ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDONZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON, ZSL UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDONUNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON, UCL INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCEINTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE, IFS, 5353-1 COORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIORCOORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIOR, CAPES, 88882.184240/2018-1 CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTÍFICO E TECNOLÓGICO, CNPQ, 190-2012, 457434/2012-0",63207,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,20,NA,NA,ELSEVIER LTD,NA,SCOPUS,STRICT PROTECTED AREAS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE CONSERVATION OF LARGER AND THREATENED MAMMALS IN A PRIORITY REGION OF THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090404781&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2020.108762&partnerID=40&md5=0f87264659fd7218ad9871060a26d27f,251,2020,"THIS PROJECT WAS PRINCIPALLY FUNDED BY CNPQ ( 457434/2012-0 ), WWF-BRASIL ( 190-2012 ), INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE ( 5353-1 ) AND IDESE .

IN THE LAST CENTURIES, SIKA DEER (CERVUS NIPPON) HAVE BEEN WIDELY SPREAD FROM THEIR NATIVE AREAL (CHINA, JAPAN, VIET NAM, KOREA, TAIWAN AND RUSSIA) ACROSS MOST CONTINENTS AND THEY ARE NOWADAYS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST INVASIVE EXISTING MAMMAL SPECIES. IN THIS STUDY, WE JOINTLY USED TWO SOFTWARE TOOLS (VOSVIEWER AND CITESPACE) TO QUANTITATIVELY REVIEW AND INVESTIGATE THE GLOBAL SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE ON THE SIKA DEER. WE REVIEWED AND ANALYSED THE PATTERNS AND TRENDS IN GLOBAL SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE ON THE SPECIES, PERFORMING CO-AUTHORSHIP AND CO-OCCURRENCE ANALYSES AND CREATING RELATIVE NETWORK MAPS. THE RESULTS SHOWED A HIGH AND CONSTANT PRODUCTIVITY OF JAPAN, FOLLOWED BY CHINA AND USA, WITH CHINA HAVING AN INCREASE IN PRODUCTION OVER THE LAST YEARS. KEYWORDS AS “HYBRIDIZATION” AND “INTROGRESSION” FIGURED AMONG THE MOST FREQUENTLY INVESTIGATED TOPICS, SUGGESTING GENETICS AS AN IMPORTANT FIELD OF RESEARCH, FOLLOWED BY THE IMPACTS OF THE SPECIES ON THE VEGETATION. OUT OF THE SPECIES NATIVE RANGE, THE MOST PRODUCTIVE COUNTRY WAS THE UK, FOLLOWED BY GERMANY AND CZECH REPUBLIC, WITH SIMILAR PREFERENCES FOR THE TOPIC OF “HYBRIDIZATION” AND “INTROGRESSION”. IN ADDITION, WE INVESTIGATED THE PRESENCE OF KEYWORDS THAT EXPERIENCED AN ABRUPT INCREASE IN NUMBER OF CITATIONS (I.E. “CITATION BURST”) ACROSS THE SIKA DEER SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. THE ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED TRENDS, HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF GENETIC STUDIES APPLIED TO THE NATIVE FAUNA. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION TRENDS ON SIKA DEER FOLLOW DIFFERENT AND DEFINED RESEARCH FLOWS ACCORDING TO THE AREA OF INVESTIGATION. IN ADDITION, IT IS POSSIBLE TO NOTICE THAT COUNTRIES WITH THE BIGGEST OR MOST INVASIVE POPULATIONS ARE ALSO THE MOST PROLIFIC.

BIOGEOGR.,1,"AIM: THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROTECTED AREAS IS AMONG THE MOST WIDESPREAD RESPONSES TO MITIGATE SPECIES LOSS. ALTHOUGH PROTECTED AREAS ARE OFTEN ASSUMED TO HAVE CONSERVATION BENEFITS, NEGATIVE IMPACTS HAVE ALSO BEEN DOCUMENTED. ONE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE OUTCOME IS LEAKAGE, WHEREBY PROTECTED AREAS DISPLACE LAND-USE ACTIVITIES HARMFUL TO CONSERVATION INTO ADJACENT AREAS. THIS CAN UNDERMINE PROTECTION BY ACCELERATING LOSS OF SPECIES OR SKEWING JUDGEMENTS OF EFFECTIVENESS. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE PREVALENCE OF DEFORESTATION LEAKAGE IN A PAN-TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL SELECTION OF 120 PROTECTED AREAS. LOCATION: TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL FOREST REGIONS OF AMERICA, AFRICA AND ASIA. TIME PERIOD: 2001–2017. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: THREATENED SPECIES OF AMPHIBIANS, BIRDS AND TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS. METHODS: WE USED GLOBAL FOREST CHANGE DATA TO ASSESS THE AVERAGE YEARLY RATE OF DEFORESTATION IN PROTECTED AREAS, PROTECTED AREA BUFFER ZONES AND STATISTICALLY MATCHED, UNPROTECTED CONTROL AREAS. WE CALCULATED AND COMPARED IRREPLACEABILITY OF HABITAT FOR THREATENED AMPHIBIAN, BIRD AND TERRESTRIAL MAMMAL SPECIES BETWEEN PROTECTED AREAS AND BUFFER ZONES. RESULTS: IN 55 CASES, DEFORESTATION RATES WERE HIGHER IN BUFFER ZONES THAN IN PROTECTED AND CONTROL AREAS, SUGGESTING A RELATIVELY HIGH PREVALENCE OF DEFORESTATION LEAKAGE STEMMING FROM PROTECTED AREAS. IN 78.2% OF DOCUMENTED LEAKAGE CASES, REDUCED DEFORESTATION IN PROTECTED AREAS WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET THE AMOUNT OF DEFORESTATION IN 10 KM BUFFER ZONES TO A LEVEL THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED WITHOUT PROTECTION. IN 90.9% OF LEAKAGE CASES, THE IRREPLACEABILITY OF SPECIES IN THE 10 KM BUFFER ZONE WAS GREATER THAN THAT OF THE PROTECTED AREA, IMPLYING A NEGATIVE IMPACT OF LEAKAGE ON THREATENED SPECIES. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PROTECTED AREAS ARE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING DEFORESTATION WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION; HOWEVER, LEAKAGE PATTERNS CAN UNDERMINE CONSERVATION SUCCESS BECAUSE BUFFER ZONES OFTEN CONTAIN HABITAT FOR THREATENED SPECIES. WE RECOMMEND ACCOUNTING FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF LEAKAGE WHEN DESIGNING NEW PROTECTED AREAS AND NETWORKS. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

WHILE THIS CONSTITUTES A CONSERVATION SUCCESS, THERE IS INCREASING CONCERN ABOUT THEIR IMPACTS ON SHARED RESOURCES WITH HUMANS. UNDERSTANDING UNGULATE FOOD CHOICES IS CRUCIAL FOR PREDICTING SUCH IMPACTS. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON SINGLE SPECIES OR COMMUNITIES AT NARROW SPATIAL SCALES. HERE, WE USED 265 PUBLISHED DIETS FROM 87 EUROPEAN STUDIES TO INVESTIGATE PATTERNS OF RESOURCE USE BY FOUR COMMON DEER SPECIES (MOOSE ALCES ALCES, RED DEER CERVUS ELAPHUS, ROE DEER CAPREOLUS CAPREOLUS AND FALLOW DEER DAMA DAMA), AND WILD BOAR SUS SCROFA AT THE CONTINENTAL SCALE. ON AVERAGE, DEER DIETS SEPARATED MOSTLY ALONG A GRADIENT FROM GRASS TO BROWSE. FALLOW DEER DIETS CONTAINED THE MOST AND MOOSE DIETS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF GRASS, BUT WE ALSO FOUND LARGE INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION AMONG ALL DEER SPECIES. DIETS OF ROE DEER, A PRESUMED BROWSER, FREQUENTLY CONTAINED ≥ 25% GRASS. WILD BOAR DIET CONTAINED GRASS IN AMOUNTS SIMILAR TO RED DEER BUT OTHERWISE DIFFERED STRONGLY FROM DEER DIETS. ALL FIVE UNGULATE SPECIES SHIFTED TO EATING HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF WOODY BROWSE DURING WINTER. HABITAT INFLUENCED VARIATION IN INTRASPECIFIC DIETS, BUT THE PROPORTIONS OF KEY FORAGE TYPES RELATED TO FEEDING TYPE (I.E. GRASS FOR INTERMEDIATE FEEDERS RED AND FALLOW DEER, AND SHRUBS FOR THE BROWSERS MOOSE AND ROE DEER) REMAINED FAIRLY CONSISTED ACROSS HABITAT TYPES. IN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE, DIET SIMILARITY BETWEEN ROE DEER AND RED DEER WAS HIGHEST DURING WINTER AND SPRING AND LOWEST DURING SUMMER AND AUTUMN BUT REMAINED CONSTANT ACROSS THE SEASONS IN SOUTHERN EUROPE. WE FORESEE THAT, AS INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS DRIVEN BY LAND-USE AND CLIMATIC CHANGES INCREASE ACROSS EUROPE, FURTHER MONITORING AND TESTING WILL BE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF DIETARY NICHE PARTITIONING AMONG UNGULATES. © 2020 NORDIC SOCIETY OIKOS.

PROCESSED LANDSAT IMAGERY WAS USED TO MAP AND MONITOR CHANGES IN LAND USE AND LAND COVER. FROM 1975 TO 2017 THE AREA OF HIGH-VALUE FOREST LANDSCAPES DECREASED BY C. 420,000 HA, AND INCREASING FOREST FRAGMENTATION CAUSED A DECLINE OF C. 12% IN THE LARGEST PATCH INDEX.

ONE HYPOTHESIS TO EXPLAIN THIS PHENOMENON IS THAT ABUNDANT ANTHROPOGENIC RESOURCES FOR WILDLIFE (I.E., FOOD AND SHELTER) OUTWEIGH THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH URBANIZATION. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE USED CAMERA TRAPS TO MEASURE MAMMAL SPECIES RICHNESS, DIVERSITY, AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE (I.E., DETECTION RATE) IN 58 RESIDENTIAL YARDS IN RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, FOCUSING ON SIX TYPES OF FEATURES THAT MIGHT BE USED AS RESOURCES: ANIMAL FEEDING, VEGETABLE GARDENS, COMPOST PILES, CHICKEN COOPS, BRUSHPILES, AND WATER SOURCES. WE ALSO PLACED CAMERAS AT RANDOM CONTROL SITES WITHIN EACH YARD AND SAMPLED FORESTS IN NEARBY SUBURBAN AND RURAL AREAS FOR COMPARISON. WE FIT MIXED-EFFECTS POISSON MODELS TO DETERMINE WHETHER YARD FEATURES, YARD-SCALE CHARACTERISTICS, OR LANDSCAPE-SCALE LANDCOVER PREDICTED MAMMAL RELATIVE ABUNDANCE FOR EIGHT SPECIES. WE ALSO TESTED IF THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF NATIVE CANID PREDATORS IN YARDS WAS RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF PREY (RODENTS AND LAGOMORPHS). SPECIES RICHNESS, DIVERSITY, AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF MOST MAMMAL SPECIES WAS HIGHER IN YARDS AND SUBURBAN FORESTS THAN IN RURAL FORESTS. WITHIN A YARD, PURPOSEFUL FEEDING HAD THE STRONGEST EFFECT ON ANIMAL RELATIVE ABUNDANCE, WITH EASTERN GRAY SQUIRRELS (SCIURUS CAROLINENSIS) BEING THE MOST COMMON (32.3 SQUIRRELS/DAY AT FEEDERS; 0.55 AT CONTROL SITES; 0.29 IN SUBURBAN FORESTS; AND 0.10 IN RURAL FORESTS). WE OBSERVED SPECIES USING (E.G., EATING) MOST YARD FEATURES, ALTHOUGH CANIDS WERE LESS LIKELY THAN OTHER TAXA TO USE RESOURCES IN YARDS. THE PRESENCE OF A YARD FEATURE DID NOT STRONGLY AFFECT THE ABUNDANCE OF SPECIES AT THE CONTROL SITE IN THE YARD, SUGGESTING THE INFLUENCE OF THESE FEATURES WAS HIGHLY LOCALIZED. THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF PREDATORS HAD A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WITH PREY RELATIVE ABUNDANCE, AND PREDATORS WERE LESS COMMON IN YARDS WITH FENCES. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE IS HIGH USE OF ANTHROPOGENIC RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY SUPPLEMENTAL FEEDING BY URBAN WILDLIFE, AND THIS INCREASE IN PREY SPECIES MAY THEN ATTRACT PREDATORS, WHICH SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT USE OF SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD RESOURCES EXPLAINS THE ABUNDANCE OF URBAN WILDLIFE. © COPYRIGHT © 2020 HANSEN, PARSONS, KAYS AND MILLSPAUGH.",570771,NA,NA,"HANSEN, C.P.; WILDLIFE BIOLOGY PROGRAM, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: CHRISTOPHER3.HANSEN@UMONTANA.EDU",ARTICLE,10.3389/fevo.2020.570771,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, 1539622",2296701X,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,10,NA,NA,FRONTIERS MEDIA S.A.,NA,SCOPUS,DOES USE OF BACKYARD RESOURCES EXPLAIN THE ABUNDANCE OF URBAN WILDLIFE?,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117505924&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2020.570771&partnerID=40&md5=3068c68655ad9e889deb71aa895efa0a,8,2020,THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (GRANT # 1539622).

USING GENERAL LINEAR MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS, WE INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF MEDIUM-TERM (MONTHS−YEARS) ENVIRONMENTAL (DIEL PERIOD, WATER TEMPERATURE, SEASON, WIND SPEED, AIR PRESSURE, HABITAT TYPE) AND BIOLOGICAL (TURTLE SIZE) VARIATION ON SPACE-USE METRICS FOR THE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED HAWKSBILL SEA TURTLE ERETMOCHELYS IMBRICATA, INCLUDING DIVE DURATION, ACTIVITY SPACE, AND RATE OF MOVEMENT.

IN PREPARING THE EU'S BIODIVERSITY STRATEGY 2030, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO UNRAVEL DIFFERENT VISIONS ABOUT CONSERVATION TARGETS FOR AGRICULTURE, AND TO UNDERSTAND POTENTIAL TRADE-OFFS WITH FOOD PRODUCTION. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE TRANSLATED THE NARRATIVES OF EXPERTS INTO TWO CONSERVATION SCENARIOS ON A CASE STUDY AREA RESEMBLING THE DUTCH DAIRY SECTOR. THE SCENARIOS REFLECTED A TARGETED VERSUS A GENERIC APPROACH TOWARDS CONSERVATION. IN THE TARGETED CONSERVATION (TC) SCENARIO, EXTENSIVE GRASSLAND, REDUCED DRAINAGE AND DELAYED MOWING WERE APPLIED IN CORE AREAS TO ENHANCE MEADOW BIRD ABUNDANCE, WHEREAS IN THE GENERIC CONSERVATION (GC) SCENARIO, NETWORKS OF NATURE AND EXTENSIVE AGRICULTURE WERE CREATED AND NO FEED WAS IMPORTED, WHICH REQUIRED A CHANGE IN LOCAL AGRICULTURAL LAND USE. SUBSEQUENTLY, TOTAL FEED AND FOOD (MILK AND MEAT) PRODUCTION AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY WERE ASSESSED, USING THE TOTAL ENERGY AND PROTEIN VALUE FOR DAIRY, DAIRY PRODUCTIVITY AND THE POTENTIALLY DISAPPEARED FRACTION (PDF) OF PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS. LAND USE CHANGED ON 6% OF THE CASE STUDY AREA IN THE TC SCENARIO, AND 69 % IN THE GC SCENARIO. FEED PRODUCTION PER HA (NET ENERGY FOR LACTATION) WAS REDUCED BY 3% FOR THE TC AND 41 % FOR THE GC SCENARIO. FOOD PRODUCTION ON THE CASE STUDY AREA REDUCED TO THE SAME EXTENT IN TC, AND TO A LARGER EXTENT (BY ABOUT TWO THIRDS) IN GC BECAUSE NO FEED WAS IMPORTED. IN CONSEQUENCE, BIODIVERSITY INCREASED, THUS REDUCING THE PDF FROM 0.17 IN THE BASELINE SCENARIO TO 0.16 IN THE TC SCENARIO AND 0.10 IN THE GC SCENARIO. IN BOTH SCENARIOS, EXTENSIVE GRASSLAND OFFSET PART OF THE LOSS IN PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS CAUSED BY CROPLAND AND INTENSIVE GRASSLAND. IMPLEMENTING THESE OPPOSING SCENARIOS REQUIRES DIFFERENT POLICY APPROACHES OR INCENTIVES FOR THE DAIRY SECTOR. MOREOVER, JUDGING WHETHER MEASURES ARE WORTH THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FOR BIODIVERSITY DEPENDS ON STAKEHOLDERS’ VALUES.

MILLIONS OF HECTARES OF FURTHER CLEARANCE ARE PREDICTED AS RUBBER DEMAND RISES, WHICH WILL HAVE MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR BIODIVERSITY [3]. A KEY QUESTION IS HOW TO RECONCILE RUBBER EXPANSION WITH BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. WE ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY OF SIMULTANEOUSLY MEETING GLOBAL FUTURE DEMAND FOR RUBBER WITH CONSERVATION OF EXTINCTION-THREATENED AMPHIBIANS, BIRDS, MAMMALS, AND REPTILES. WE COMPARED THE SPATIAL CONGRUENCE OF RUBBER BIOCLIMATIC SUITABILITY WITH EXTINCTION VULNERABILITY [4] IN AFRICA, ASIA, AND NEW GUINEA, WHERE LARGE-SCALE RUBBER CULTIVATION IS VIABLE, AND SIMULATED RUBBER EXPANSION UNDER DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. WE FOUND NO “WIN-WIN” AREAS WITH HIGHEST RUBBER SUITABILITY AND LOWEST EXTINCTION VULNERABILITY. PROJECTED RUBBER DEMAND COULD BE MET BY ALLOWING EXPANSION PRIMARILY IN NEW GUINEA AND AFRICAN GUINEA. HOWEVER, NEW GUINEA HAS HIGH ECOSYSTEM INTACTNESS AND BOTH REGIONS ARE RICH IN ENDEMICS. SCENARIOS SUGGEST CONVERTING ONLY AREAS SUITABLE FOR CULTIVATION WOULD CAUSE THE LARGEST BIODIVERSITY LOSSES, INCLUDING ENDANGERED SPECIES, WHEREAS PRIORITIZING CONSERVATION WOULD RESULT IN ONLY THE CONVERSION OF HIGHLY UNSUITABLE LAND. COMPROMISE SCENARIOS THAT BALANCE PRODUCTION WITH CONSERVATION COULD CUT BIODIVERSITY LOSSES BY TWO-THIRDS, PROTECTING MOST ENDANGERED SPECIES WHILE MAINTAINING HIGH RUBBER SUITABILITY. DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-YIELDING HARDY CLONES EXPANDS THE AMOUNT OF WIN-WIN AREAS, AS WELL AS SUITABLE AREAS WITH HIGH EXTINCTION RISK.

IN 494 SAMPLES ACROSS ALL SEVEN SPECIES OF LYCIASALAMANDRA, B. SALAMANDRIVORANS WAS FOUND TO BE ABSENT. SINGLE EXPOSURE TO A LOW (1000) NUMBER OF FUNGAL ZOOSPORES RESULTED IN FAST BUILDUP OF LETHAL INFECTIONS IN THREE L. HELVERSENI. THERMAL PREFERENCE OF THE SALAMANDERS WAS WELL WITHIN THE THERMAL ENVELOPE OF THE PATHOGEN AND BODY TEMPERATURES NEVER EXCEEDED THE FUNGUS’ THERMAL CRITICAL MAXIMUM, LIMITING THE SALAMANDERS’ DEFENSE OPPORTUNITIES. THE RELATIVELY LOW THERMAL HOST PREFERENCE LARGELY INVALIDATES MACROCLIMATIC BASED HABITAT SUITABILITY PREDICTIONS AND, COMBINED WITH CURRENT PATHOGEN ABSENCE AND HIGH HOST DENSITIES, SUGGESTS A HIGH PROBABILITY OF LOCAL SALAMANDER POPULATION DECLINES UPON INVASION BY B. SALAMANDRIVORANS. HOWEVER, THE UNFAVORABLE LANDSCAPE THAT SHAPED INTRASPECIFIC HOST GENETIC DIVERSITY, LACK OF KNOWN ALTERNATIVE HOSTS AND RAPID HOST MORTALITY AFTER INFECTION PRESENT BARRIERS TO FURTHER, NATURAL PATHOGEN DISPERSAL BETWEEN POPULATIONS AND THUS SPECIES EXTINCTION.

THESE TRADE-OFFS ARE PARTICULARLY STRONG IN TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL DEFORESTATION FRONTIERS, YET IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW CHANGING LANDSCAPE CONTEXT IN SUCH FRONTIERS ALTERS AGRICULTURE–BIODIVERSITY TRADE–OFFS. WE FOCUS ON THE ARGENTINEAN CHACO, A GLOBAL DEFORESTATION HOTSPOT, TO EXPLORE HOW LANDSCAPE CONTEXT SHAPES TRADE-OFF CURVES BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL INTENSITY AND AVIAN BIODIVERSITY. WE USE A SPACE-FOR-TIME APPROACH AND INTEGRATE A LARGE FIELD DATASET OF BIRD COMMUNITIES (197 SPECIES, 234 SURVEY PLOTS), THREE AGRICULTURAL INTENSITY METRICS (MEAT YIELD, ENERGY YIELD AND PROFIT) AND A RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL COVARIATES IN A HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN OCCUPANCY FRAMEWORK. WOODLAND EXTENT IN THE LANDSCAPE CONSISTENTLY DETERMINES HOW INDIVIDUAL BIRD SPECIES, AND THE BIRD COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE, RESPOND TO AGRICULTURAL INTENSITY. MANY SPECIES SWITCH IN THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSE, FROM DECREASING OCCUPANCY WITH INCREASED AGRICULTURAL INTENSITY WHEN WOODLAND EXTENT IN THE LANDSCAPE IS LOW (LOSER SPECIES), TO INCREASING OCCUPANCY WITH INCREASED AGRICULTURAL INTENSITY WHEN WOODLAND EXTENT IS HIGH (WINNER SPECIES). THIS SUGGESTS THAT LANDSCAPE CONTEXT STRONGLY MEDIATES WHO WINS AND LOSES ALONG AGRICULTURAL INTENSITY GRADIENTS. LIKEWISE, WHERE LANDSCAPES CHANGE, SUCH AS IN DEFORESTATION FRONTIERS, THE VERY NATURE OF THE AGRICULTURE–BIODIVERSITY TRADE–OFFS CAN CHANGE AS LANDSCAPES TRANSFORMATION PROGRESSES. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. SCHEMES TO MITIGATE AGRICULTURE–BIODIVERSITY TRADE–OFFS, SUCH AS LAND SPARING OR SHARING, MUST CONSIDER LANDSCAPE CONTEXT. STRATEGIES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED BASED ON A SNAPSHOT OF DATA RISK FAILURE IN DYNAMIC LANDSCAPES, PARTICULARLY WHERE AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION CONTINUES TO REDUCE NATURAL HABITATS. RATHER THAN A SINGLE, FIXED STRATEGY, ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURE–BIODIVERSITY TRADE–OFFS IS NEEDED IN SUCH SITUATIONS.

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO MEASURE, MAP AND RANK CORE AREAS AND CORRIDORS FOR MAINLAND CLOUDED LEOPARD (A FOREST INDICATOR SPECIES) ACROSS ITS ENTIRE RANGE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. WE USED AN EMPIRICALLY BASED LANDSCAPE RESISTANCE MODEL DEVELOPED FROM RANGE-WIDE CAMERA SURVEY DATA, CUMULATIVE RESISTANT KERNEL ANALYSIS TO DEFINE CORE AREAS AND LEAST-COST NETWORK ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY CORRIDORS FOR LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL. WE THEN RANKED CORE AREAS BASED ON THEIR STRENGTH AND SIZE, AND CORRIDORS BASED ON THEIR STRENGTH AND THE STRENGTH OF CORE AREAS THEY CONNECT. WE FOUND THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT CORE AREAS AND CORRIDORS ARE CONCENTRATED IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, LARGELY IN MYANMAR, LAOS AND MALAYSIA. MYANMAR CONTAINS NEARLY THE ENTIRETY OF THE FIRST AND THIRD HIGHEST RANKED CORE AREAS, AS WELL AS THE MOST IMPORTANT NETWORK OF CORRIDORS IN SE ASIA. ALMOST THE ENTIRE TERRITORY OF LAOS CONSTITUTES ONE LARGE POTENTIAL CORE AREA, RANKED AS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ACROSS THE CLOUDED LEOPARD’S RANGE. A LARGE NUMBER (22) OF VERY SMALL (&LT;8000 KM2) AND FAIRLY ISOLATED CORE AREAS ARE IN CHINA. ONLY 24% OF CLOUDED LEOPARD CORE AREAS AND 17% OF CORRIDORS ARE PROTECTED.

COMBINING DISCUSSIONS AND SHORT INTERVIEWS CARRIED OUT PRE AND POST-STORMS IRMA AND ALBERTO, THIS STUDY IDENTIFIES MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND MATCHING RESPONSES. IN ADDITION, THE ARTICLE SHEDS LIGHT ON THE EVOLUTION OF SMALL-SCALE FISHING COMMUNITIES IN CUBA AND THEIR CURRENT ORGANIZATION. RESULTS SHOW LOCAL PERCEPTIONS OF EXTENSIVE BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN TERMS OF MANGROVE COVERAGE, CHANGES IN SALINITY, AND THE QUALITY OF COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE COMPOSITION OF CAPTURES AND FISH SIZES. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THESE CHANGES, FISHERS ARE ADJUSTING THEIR EFFORT AND FISHING INTENSITY TO MATCH PERTURBATIONS. FINDINGS UNDERSCORE THE NEED TO IDENTIFY THE SYNERGISTIC RELATIONS THAT MAY EXIST BETWEEN PRIOR ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND DIFFERENT EXTREME EVENTS SUCH AS DROUGHTS, HURRICANES, AND EXCESSIVE PRECIPITATION. THE INTERRELATION OF THESE FACTORS MAY RESULT IN COMPOUNDED AGGRAVATED IMPACTS THAT MAY UNFOLD OVER LONGER TEMPORAL SCALES AND NOT JUST AS A ONE-TIME EVENT. AUTHORS CONCLUDE BY STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING THE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF EXTREME EVENTS ALONG WITH LOCAL PERCEPTIONS OF ECOLOGICAL CHANGE IN FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLANS.

CURRENT NATIONAL LEGISLATION HAS BEEN UNEVENLY IMPLEMENTED AND, IN THIS ARTICLE, WE RECOMMEND FRAMEWORKS BE DEVELOPED TO STANDARDIZE THE PROVISION AND USE OF GENETIC RESOURCES FOR NON-COMMERCIAL RESEARCH. SUMMARY: ACCESS TO GENETIC RESOURCES FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IS VITAL TO SUPPORT AND PROMOTE THE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF THE WORLD'S BIODIVERSITY. THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR RESEARCH IS STIPULATED BY ACCESS AND BENEFIT SHARING (ABS) LEGISLATION AT A NATIONAL LEVEL, BUT OTHER ELEMENTS – LEGAL TRANSPARENCY, RESPECT, COOPERATION, AND TRUST – ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ITS EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE IMPLEMENTATION. DESPITE THE INTENTION OF THIS “ABS REGIME” TO PROTECT NATURAL RESOURCES AND ASSOCIATED KNOWLEDGE FROM MISAPPROPRIATION, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE QUESTIONED WHETHER NATIONAL REGULATORY APPROACHES HAVE LED TO CONSTRAINTS ON RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION. WE ANALYSE EVIDENCE AND PROVIDE CASE STUDIES ON HOW THESE REGULATIONS ARE AFFECTING RESEARCH. WE FIND THAT THE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CERTIFICATES OF COMPLIANCE (IRCC) OF THE NAGOYA PROTOCOL (NP), THE KEY COMPLIANCE MECHANISM OF THE ABS SYSTEM, DOUBLED IN THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 2020 AND ANALYSE WHY THIS MAY BE THE CASE.

IN THIS PAPER, WE ARGUE THAT FAILING TO ENCOURAGE TOURISTS TO DO MORE ON BEHALF OF WILDLIFE REPRESENTS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR CONSERVATION. BASED ON A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE, WE SHOW THAT CONSERVATION MESSAGING IS VIRTUALLY ABSENT FROM MANY MAINSTREAM WILDLIFE-BASED TOURISM OPERATIONS, OFTEN FAILING TO CONNECT GLOBAL AUDIENCES TO CONSERVATION ISSUES. WE FOUND THAT THE SCHOLARLY LITERATURE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES, APPROACHES AND CONTENTS OF CONSERVATION MESSAGING IN WILDLIFE-BASED TOURISM IS MEAGRE AT BEST.

FUTURE PREDICTION OF FOREST DEGRADATION SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS AND FRAGMENTATION IS IMPERATIVE FOR GENERATING A FRAMEWORK THAT CAN AID IN PRIORITIZING FOREST CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. IN THIS STUDY, A RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM WAS DEVELOPED AND APPLIED TO A SERIES OF LANDSAT IMAGES OF 1998, 2008, AND 2018, TO DELINEATE SPATIOTEMPORAL FOREST COVER STATUS IN THE SANCTUARY, ALONG WITH THE PREDICTIVE MODEL VIZ.

THE MODEL'S PREDICTING ABILITY WAS ASSESSED USING A SERIES OF ACCURACY INDICES. MOREOVER, SPATIAL PATTERN ANALYSIS-WITH THE USE OF FRAGSTATS 4.2 SOFTWARE-WAS APPLIED TO THE GENERATED AND PREDICTED FOREST COVER CLASSES, TO DETERMINE FOREST FRAGMENTATION IN SWS. CHANGE DETECTION ANALYSIS SHOWED AN OVERALL DECREASE IN DENSE FOREST AND A SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN THE OPEN AND DEGRADED FORESTS. SEVERAL FRAGMENTATION METRICS WERE QUANTIFIED AT PATCH, CLASS, AND LANDSCAPE LEVEL, WHICH SHOWED TRENDS REFLECTING A DECREASE IN FRAGMENTATION IN FOREST AREAS OF SWS FOR THE PERIOD 1998 TO 2028. THE IMPROVEMENT IN SWS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ENHANCED FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES LED BY THE GOVERNMENT, FOR THE PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION OF THE SANCTUARY.

CONCERNED CONSUMERS, MAINLY FROM DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, HAVE BEGUN DEMANDING SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL IN RESPONSE TO THESE ISSUES. MORE 'BIODIVERSITY-FRIENDLY' OIL PALM PRODUCTION IS ALSO IN DEMAND, SIMILAR TO THAT OF OTHER COMMODITY CROPS (E.G. COFFEE, CACAO). HOWEVER, FARMING PRACTICES THAT IMPROVE BIODIVERSITY ARE THOUGHT TO REDUCE YIELD, LEADING TO INCREASED PRESSURE TO CLEAR MORE FOREST, RESULTING IN FURTHER BIODIVERSITY LOSS. HERE, WE EXPLORE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OIL PALM YIELD AND AVIAN BIODIVERSITY. TO GATHER DATA ON YIELDS AND AGRICULTURAL INPUTS, WE INTERVIEWED SMALLHOLDERS IN SELANGOR, PENINSULAR MALAYSIA.

DISEASE AND HABITAT LOSS ARE IMPLICATED IN MANY AMPHIBIAN SPECIES DECLINES, BUT AMPHIBIANS ARE ALSO PREDICTED TO BE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN CLIMATE, PARTICULARLY CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND LOSS OF MOISTURE. THESE CHANGES COULD SEVERELY IMPACT FROG USE OF TERRESTRIAL HABITATS. WE USED DATA FROM A LONG-TERM (2007–18) LANDSCAPE-SCALE EXPERIMENT IN SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF TERRESTRIAL HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS AND RESTORATION TREATMENTS ON FROG SPECIES. WE FOUND DECLINES IN SPECIES RICHNESS AND IN THE OCCURRENCES OF TWO LOCALLY-COMMON SPECIES (LIMNODYNASTES TASMANIENSIS AND UPEROLEIA LAEVIGATA). THESE DECLINES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES, LOW MINIMUM TEMPERATURES AND LOW RAINFALL. COARSE WOODY DEBRIS ADDITION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS AND L. TASMANIENSIS OCCURRENCE, BUT THIS EFFECT WAS NOT GREATER IN TIMES OF REDUCED RAINFALL AND HIGH MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES, IMPLYING A WEAK ‘REFUGIA’ EFFECT. FROGS WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH WETTER SITES, AND THIS ASSOCIATION INCREASED WITH HIGHER MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES. OUR FINDINGS ADD TO A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT SHOW THAT PROLONGED PERIODS OF DROUGHT POSE A KEY THREAT TO FROG POPULATIONS AND THAT SHORT PERIODS OF RELIEF FROM DROUGHT CONDITIONS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO ALLOW RECOVERY OF TERRESTRIAL FROG POPULATIONS OVER THE LONG TERM. RESTORATION EFFORTS COULD INCLUDE THE PROVISION OF COARSE WOODY DEBRIS AND SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT GOOD QUALITY AQUATIC HABITAT, SUCH AS DROUGHT-RESISTANT PONDS AND DAMS, ARE AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT HOT AND DRY TIMES AS A SUPPLEMENT TO EPHEMERAL AQUATIC HABITAT. © 2020",108712,NA,BICOB,"EVANS, M.J.; FENNER SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: M.JOHN.EVANS@ANU.EDU.AU",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108712,"AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCILAUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL, ARC, FT100100358, LP0561817, LP110100126, LP140100209",63207,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,ELSEVIER LTD,NA,SCOPUS,BEYOND THE POND: TERRESTRIAL HABITAT USE BY FROGS IN A CHANGING CLIMATE,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088944629&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2020.108712&partnerID=40&md5=bf1bc1ff59446429067e3f5a971d481b,249,2020,NA NA NA,BIOL CONSERV,none,THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO;THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY;THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED;FENNER SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY;NOTREPORTED,NA,"EVANS MJ, 2020, BIOL CONSERV","EVANS MJ, 2020, BIOL CONSERV"

GLOBALLY, SEABIRDS BREEDING ON ISLANDS HAVE PROVEN TO BE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ALIEN SPECIES. THE BREEDING COLONIES OF THE PINK-FOOTED SHEARWATER (ARDENNA CREATOPUS) ARE THREATENED BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF ALIEN MAMMALS. WE COMBINED BREEDING MONITORING DATA WITH A HIERARCHICAL MODEL TO SEPARATE THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT ALIEN MAMMAL ASSEMBLAGES ON THE BURROW OCCUPANCY AND HATCHING SUCCESS OF THE PINK-FOOTED SHEARWATER IN THE JUAN FERNÁNDEZ ARCHIPELAGO, CHILE. WE SHOW THAT ALIEN MAMMALS AFFECTED THE RATES OF BURROW OCCUPANCY, BUT HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON HATCHING SUCCESS. RABBITS PRODUCED THE HIGHEST NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON BURROW OCCUPANCY, WHEREAS THE EFFECTS OF OTHER ALIEN MAMMALS WERE MORE UNCERTAIN. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND DIFFERENCES IN BURROW OCCUPANCY BETWEEN ISLANDS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ALIEN MAMMAL ASSEMBLAGES. MANAGING RABBITS WILL IMPROVE THE REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE OF THIS SHEARWATER, BUT RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO CLARIFY THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH ALIEN MAMMALS AFFECT THE SHEARWATERS AND TO EXPLAIN WHY BURROW OCCUPANCY VARIES BETWEEN ISLANDS. © THE AUTHOR(S), 2020.

POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN EXPANDING ACROSS NORTH AMERICA BECAUSE THE SPECIES IS ADAPTABLE AND TOLERANT OF LIVING NEAR PEOPLE, AND BECAUSE MANAGEMENT AGENCIES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA CONTROLLED HUNTING AND OTHER HUMAN-SOURCES OF MORTALITY. AS A RESULT, HUMAN-BLACK BEAR CONFLICTS (DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, GENERAL NUISANCE, THREAT TO HUMAN SAFETY) HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED IN SOME AREAS, MAKING IT URGENTLY IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY A VARIETY OF MITIGATION TOOLS. PREVIOUS STUDIES CLAIMED THAT LEGAL HUNTING DID NOT DIRECTLY REDUCE CONFLICTS, BUT THEY DID NOT EVALUATE WHETHER HUNTING CONTROLLED CONFLICTS VIA MANAGEMENT OF POPULATION SIZE. HERE, WE COMPARED TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF PHONEDIN COMPLAINTS ABOUT BLACK BEARS (TOTAL ∼63,500) IN MINNESOTA, USA, OVER 4 DECADES TO CORRESPONDING BEAR POPULATION ESTIMATES: BOTH DOUBLED DURING THE FIRST DECADE. WE ALSO QUANTIFIED NATURAL BEAR FOODS, AND FOUND THAT LARGE YEAR-TO-YEAR FLUCTUATIONS AFFECTED NUMBERS OF COMPLAINTS; HOWEVER, SINCE THIS VARIATION IS DUE LARGELY TO WEATHER, THIS FACTOR CANNOT BE MANAGED. COMPLAINTS FELL SHARPLY WHEN THE MANAGEMENT AGENCY (1) SHIFTED MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PREVENTING AND MITIGATING CONFLICTS TO THE PUBLIC; AND (2) INCREASED HUNTING PRESSURE TO REDUCE THE BEAR POPULATION. THIS POPULATION REDUCTION WAS MORE EXTREME THAN INTENDED, HOWEVER, AND AFTER HUNTING PRESSURE WAS CURTAILED, POPULATION REGROWTH WAS SLOWER THAN ANTICIPATED; CONSEQUENTLY BOTH POPULATION SIZE AND COMPLAINTS REMAINED AT RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS STATEWIDE FOR 2 DECADES (ALTHOUGH WITH LOCAL HOTSPOTS). THESE LONG-TERM DATA INDICATED THAT CONFLICTS CAN BE KEPT IN TOLERABLE BOUNDS BY MANAGING POPULATION SIZE THROUGH HUNTING; BUT DUE TO THE BLUNTNESS OF THIS INSTRUMENT AND DEFICIENCIES AND UNCERTAINTIES IN MONITORING AND MANIPULATING POPULATIONS, IT IS WISER TO MAINTAIN A POPULATION AT A LEVEL WHERE CONFLICTS ARE SOCIALLY-ACCEPTABLE THAN TRY TO REDUCE IT ONCE IT IS WELL BEYOND THAT POINT. © 2020 GARSHELIS ET AL.

IN THIS PAPER, WE EXPLORE THE ROLE OF ANIMAL FARMING AND MEAT CONSUMPTION IN THE EMERGENCE AND AMPLIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. FIRST, WE DISCUSS HOW MEAT PRODUCTION INCREASES EPIDEMIC RISKS, EITHER DIRECTLY THROUGH INCREASED CONTACT WITH WILD AND FARMED ANIMALS OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH ITS IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT (E.G., BIODIVERSITY LOSS, WATER USE, CLIMATE CHANGE). TRADITIONAL FOOD SYSTEMS SUCH AS BUSHMEAT AND BACKYARD FARMING INCREASE THE RISKS OF DISEASE TRANSMISSION FROM WILD ANIMALS, WHILE INTENSIVE FARMING AMPLIFIES THE IMPACT OF THE DISEASE DUE TO THE HIGH DENSITY, GENETIC PROXIMITY, INCREASED IMMUNODEFICIENCY, AND LIVE TRANSPORT OF FARMED ANIMALS. SECOND, WE DESCRIBE THE VARIOUS DIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTS OF ANIMAL-BASED INFECTIOUS DISEASES, AND IN PARTICULAR, HOW THESE DISEASES CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ECONOMY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. LAST, WE DISCUSS POLICIES TO REDUCE THE SOCIAL COSTS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. WHILE EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS SUCH AS THE “ONE HEALTH” APPROACH FOCUS ON INCREASING FARMS’ BIOSECURITY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS, WE EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO BETTER ALIGN STAKEHOLDERS’ INCENTIVES AND TO REDUCE MEAT CONSUMPTION.

THE NATURA 2000 NETWORK IS THE LARGEST PROTECTED AREA NETWORK IN THE WORLD AND WAS CREATED TO PROTECT EUROPE'S THREATENED SPECIES AND HABITATS, OFTEN REQUIRING ACTIVE MANAGEMENT. THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AREAS CLASSIFIED UNDER THE EU BIRDS DIRECTIVE AT PROTECTING WESTERN EUROPE'S AGRO-STEPPES, THE LAST REMNANTS OF SUITABLE HABITAT FOR SEVERAL ENDANGERED BIRD SPECIES. WE QUANTIFY AGRO-STEPPE HABITAT CHANGE IN THE LAST 10 YEARS USING HIGH-RESOLUTION AERIAL IMAGES OF 21 SPECIAL PROTECTION AREAS AND SURROUNDING AREAS. THE SELECTED SPAS HOLD ONE THIRD OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION OF GREAT BUSTARDS OTIS TARDA, A FLAGSHIP CONSERVATION SPECIES. AGRO-STEPPE AREA LOSSES OCCURRED ACROSS ALL SITES SURVEYED BUT WERE 45% LOWER INSIDE NATURA 2000 COMPARED TO NON-PROTECTED AREAS. NATURA 2000 SITES STILL LOST OVER 35,000 HA OF AGRO-STEPPE HABITAT IN 10 YEARS, AN AREA THAT COULD HOLD MORE THAN 500 GREAT BUSTARDS. THESE LOW YIELD FARMLANDS ARE BEING CONVERTED PREDOMINATELY TO PERMANENT AND IRRIGATED CROPS. AT THE CURRENT RATE OF HABITAT CONVERSION, AGRO-STEPPES COULD BE REDUCED TO 50% OF THE PRESENT AREA DURING THE NEXT CENTURY. MOREOVER, THE GREATER CONVERSIONS OUTSIDE PROTECTED SITES MAY TRANSFORM THE REMAINING AGRO-STEPPES INTO ISOLATED “ISLANDS” WITH LOW POPULATION CONNECTIVITY. OUR STUDY ON AGRO-STEPPES ILLUSTRATES THE RELEVANT CONTRIBUTION OF NATURA 2000 AT PROTECTING EUROPE'S KEY HABITATS, BUT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS CRUCIAL INSUFFICIENCIES THAT STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO ACHIEVE THE CBD CONSERVATION TARGETS AND HALT BIODIVERSITY LOSS. © 2020 ELSEVIER LTD",108681,NA,BICOB,"GAMEIRO, J.; CENTRE FOR ECOLOGY, PORTUGAL; EMAIL: JGAMEIRO92@GMAIL.COM",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108681,"NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCILNATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL, NERC, NE/K006312/1 FUNDAÇÃO PARA A CIÊNCIA E A TECNOLOGIAFUNDAÇÃO PARA A CIÊNCIA E A TECNOLOGIA, FCT, PD/BD/128366/2017, SFRH/BPD/111084/2015",63207,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,11,NA,NA,ELSEVIER LTD,NA,SCOPUS,EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EUROPEAN NATURA 2000 NETWORK AT PROTECTING WESTERN EUROPE'S AGRO-STEPPES,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087674828&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2020.108681&partnerID=40&md5=7f21394f2901d40e6d3cb69d1766233b,248,2020,"JG WAS SUPPORTED BY A DOCTORAL GRANT FROM THE PORTUGUESE FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (FCT) [ PD/BD/128366/2017 ].

PRECEDING DRAMATIC CHANGES SUCH AS WILDLIFE POPULATION DECLINES AND RANGE SHIFTS, MORE SUBTLE RESPONSES MAY SIGNAL IMPENDING LARGER-SCALE CHANGE. FOR EXAMPLE, DISTURBANCE-INDUCED SHIFTS TO SPECIES’ ACTIVITY PATTERNS MAY DISRUPT TEMPORAL NICHE PARTITIONING ALONG THE 24-H TIME AXIS, COMPROMISING COMMUNITY STRUCTURE VIA ALTERED COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS. WE INVESTIGATED THE IMPACTS OF HUMAN LANDSCAPE DISTURBANCE ON SPECIES’ ACTIVITY PATTERNS AND TEMPORAL NICHE PARTITIONING IN THE CANADIAN ROCKY MOUNTAIN CARNIVORE GUILD USING CAMERA TRAP IMAGES COLLECTED ACROSS TWO REGIONS ENCOMPASSING A WIDE GRADIENT OF HUMAN FOOTPRINT. APPLYING KERNEL DENSITY ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES, WE TESTED FOR CARNIVORE SPECIES’ ACTIVITY SHIFTS 1) BETWEEN A LOW VERSUS HIGH DISTURBANCE LANDSCAPE, AND 2) IN RELATION TO SITE-SCALE DISTURBANCE. TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT HUMAN DISTURBANCE IMPACTS SPECIES’ TEMPORAL NICHE PARTITIONING, WE MODELLED ACTIVITY OVERLAP BETWEEN CO-OCCURRING CARNIVORE SPECIES IN RELATION TO NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC LANDSCAPE FEATURES, AS WELL AS CARNIVORE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. MULTIPLE CARNIVORE SPECIES ALTERED ACTIVITY PATTERNS BETWEEN THE LOW VERSUS HIGH DISTURBANCE LANDSCAPES AND CAMERA SITES, BUT THESE SHIFTS VARIED CONSIDERABLY AMONG SPECIES. WHILE WOLVES APPEARED TO INCREASE NOCTURNAL ACTIVITY IN RELATION TO DISTURBANCE, COYOTE ACTIVITY CONSISTENTLY TRENDED TOWARDS CATHEMERALITY AND MARTEN INCREASED DIURNAL ACTIVITY. DETECTING EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE DISTURBANCE ON ACTIVITY OVERLAP BETWEEN CO-OCCURRING SPECIES WAS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO SITE-LEVEL DETECTION SAMPLE SIZES, AND OUR RESULTS SUGGEST ALTERED TEMPORAL NICHE PARTITIONING BETWEEN MARTEN AND WOLVERINE IN RELATION TO FOREST COVER. THIS STUDY INDICATES THAT MESOCARNIVORES MAY RESPOND DIFFERENTLY AND PERHAPS INDIRECTLY TO ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE COMPARED TO APEX PREDATORS. APEX PREDATOR SHIFTS TO NOCTURNALITY MAY FACILITATE A ‘BEHAVIOURAL RELEASE’ IN MESOCARNIVORES.

TO THIS END, BIODIVERSITY IMPACT METRICS SHOULD BE ABLE TO REPORT LINKED TRENDS IN SPECIFIC HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND CHANGES IN BIODIVERSITY STATE, ACCOUNTING FOR BOTH THE ECOLOGY OF DIFFERENT SPECIES AND THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF HISTORICAL HABITAT LOSSES. THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE NOT CURRENTLY CAPTURED WITHIN A SINGLE METRIC. HERE, WE DEVELOP A GLOBALLY APPLICABLE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK THAT USES FREELY AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASETS TO QUANTIFY THE RELATIVE IMPACTS OF ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES ON BIODIVERSITY. WE USE SPECIES-SPECIFIC HABITAT SUITABILITY MODELS TO LINK SPECIFIC LAND USES TO ENSUING CHANGES IN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT LOCAL POPULATIONS OF THOSE SPECIES WILL PERSIST. TO ILLUSTRATE OUR APPROACH, WE ASSESS THE IMPACTS OF SOY EXPANSION AND OTHER LAND USES WITHIN THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO ON OVER 2,000 SPECIES OF AMPHIBIANS, BIRDS, MAMMALS AND PLANTS FOR THREE PERIODS BETWEEN 2000 AND 2014. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT MAMMALS AND PLANTS SUFFERED THE GREATEST OVERALL REDUCTION OF SUITABLE HABITAT. HOWEVER, AMONG ENDEMIC AND NEAR-ENDEMIC SPECIES—WHICH FACE GREATEST RISK OF GLOBAL EXTINCTION FROM HABITAT CONVERSION IN THE CERRADO—BIRDS AND MAMMALS WERE THE MOST AFFECTED GROUPS. WHILE CONVERSION OF NATURAL VEGETATION TO GRASSLAND AND PLANTED PASTURES WERE TOGETHER RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE BIODIVERSITY IMPACT OF RECENT CHANGES, SOY EXPANSION (VIA DIRECT CONVERSION OF NATURAL VEGETATION) HAD THE GREATEST IMPACT PER UNIT AREA. THE TOTAL BIODIVERSITY IMPACT OF RECENT LAND-USE CHANGE WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE SOUTHERN STATES OF THE CERRADO—MINAS GERÁIS, GOIÁS AND MATO GROSSO—BUT THE IMPACT ON BIODIVERSITY OF PRODUCTION OF SOY WAS GREATEST WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL FRONTIERS OF BAHÍA AND PIAUÍ. THE FLEXIBILITY OF OUR APPROACH TO EXAMINE LINKAGES BETWEEN BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND SPECIFIC HUMAN ACTIVITIES HAS CLEAR POTENTIAL TO BETTER CHARACTERIZE THE PATHWAYS BY WHICH HABITAT LOSS DRIVERS OPERATE. ITS CAPACITY TO INCORPORATE SPECIES-SPECIFIC ECOLOGICAL NEEDS, THROUGH A GLOBALLY APPLICABLE METHODOLOGY, CAN IMPROVE THE TANGIBILITY OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS ASSESSMENTS. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

HOWEVER, CORRIDOR ASSESSMENTS TYPICALLY IGNORE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN CARNIVORES AND PEOPLE, WHICH CAN UNDERMINE CORRIDOR EFFECTIVENESS AND THUS CONSERVATION SUCCESS. OBJECTIVES: WE IDENTIFIED SAFE DISPERSAL CORRIDORS AND CONFLICT-PRONE MOVEMENT BOTTLENECKS FOR PERSIAN LEOPARD (PANTHERA PARDUS SAXICOLOR) BETWEEN PROTECTED AREAS IN THE ALBORZ MOUNTAINS, IRAN, BY MAPPING HABITAT, LANDSCAPE PERMEABILITY, AND CONFLICT RISK. WE THEN IDENTIFIED PRIORITY AREAS FOR CONSERVATION INTERVENTIONS ACCORDING TO THE INTENSITIES OF DIFFERENT THREATS. METHODS: WE MAPPED LAND COVER USING LANDSAT SATELLITE IMAGES, GATHERED DATA ON LEOPARD AND PREY DISTRIBUTIONS AND LIVESTOCK DEPREDATION EVENTS VIA INTERVIEW SURVEYS IN 69 CELLS OF 6 × 6 KM EACH. WE THEN USED OCCUPANCY MODELING TO IDENTIFY HABITAT PATCHES, USED CIRCUIT THEORY MODELING TO ANALYZE LANDSCAPE PERMEABILITY, AND ASSESSED HUMAN-LEOPARD CONFLICT RISK USING GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS. RESULTS: LEOPARD HABITAT USE INCREASED WITH PREY AVAILABILITY AND DECREASED WITH ELEVATION. PREY DISTRIBUTION, IN TURN, WAS MOSTLY NEGATIVELY INFLUENCED BY AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND DISTANCE FROM PROTECTED AREAS. CONFLICT RISK (I.E., PROBABILITY OF LEOPARD DEPREDATION ON LIVESTOCK) WAS HIGH IN LANDSCAPES WHERE AGRICULTURE WAS WIDESPREAD AND HISTORICAL FOREST LOSS HIGH. NOT ACCOUNTING FOR CONFLICTS OVERESTIMATED CONNECTIVITY AMONG HABITAT PATCHES SUBSTANTIALLY. CONCLUSIONS: HUMAN-CARNIVORE CONFLICTS ARE AN IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT TO CONNECTIVITY AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CORRIDOR ASSESSMENTS.

THESE CONFLICTS COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HARMFUL ATTITUDES SUCH AS LETHAL CONTROL METHODS THAT AFFECT THE DEMOGRAPHY AND CONSERVATION OF SCAVENGER BIRD POPULATIONS.

LAND PLANTS DOMINATE THE GLOBAL BIOMASS AND TERRESTRIAL ARTHROPODS PROBABLY DOMINATE IN TERMS OF NUMBERS OF SPECIES, BUT MOST OF THE TREE OF LIFE CONSISTS OF SINGLE-CELLED EUKARYOTES, BACTERIA, AND ARCHAEA. WILD PLANTS PROVIDE A HUGE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO PEOPLE, RANGING FROM THOSE THAT ARE SPECIES-SPECIFIC, SUCH AS FOOD, MEDICINE, AND GENETIC RESOURCES, TO MANY WHICH ARE PARTLY INTERCHANGEABLE, SUCH AS TIMBER AND FORAGE FOR DOMESTIC ANIMALS, AND OTHERS WHICH DEPEND ON THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, BUT NOT ON INDIVIDUAL SPECIES, SUCH AS REGULATION OF WATER SUPPLY AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION. THE USE OF INFORMATION FROM REMOTE SENSING HAS ENCOURAGED A SIMPLIFIED VIEW OF THE VALUES OF NATURE'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO PEOPLE, BUT THIS DOES NOT MATCH THE WAY MOST PEOPLE VALUE NATURE. WE CAN CURRENTLY ESTIMATE THE PROPORTION OF SPECIES THREATENED BY HUMAN IMPACTS ONLY FOR A FEW WELL-ASSESSED GROUPS, FOR WHICH IT RANGES FROM 14% (BIRDS) TO 63% (CYCADS).

THIS TRANSFORMATION PROCESS REPRESENTS A PROFOUND CHANGE IN WOODED ENVIRONMENTS, DISRUPTING ORIGINAL COMMUNITIES OF FLORA AND FAUNA. MANY SPECIES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON FORESTS, ESPECIALLY PARROTS (PSITTACIFORMES) WITH ALMOST A THIRD OF THEIR SPECIES THREATENED BY EXTINCTION. MOST PARROT SPECIES OCCUR IN TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL FORESTS, AND GIVEN THE FOREST DEPENDENCE OF MOST SPECIES, THIS IS THE MAIN REASON WHY HABITAT LOSS HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED AS THE MAIN THREAT FOR THE GROUP. SUCH HABITAT LOSS ACTS IN SYNERGY WITH OTHER IMPORTANT THREATS (E.G., LOGGING AND POACHING), WHICH BECOME ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC IN CERTAIN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ALONG TROPICAL LATITUDES. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON PARROT DISTRIBUTIONS, SPECIES TRAITS, IUCN ASSESSMENT, HABITAT LOSS AND TIMBER EXTRACTION FOR DIFFERENT PERIODS, AND DISTRIBUTION OF PROTECTED AREAS, TO DETERMINE CONSERVATION HOTSPOTS FOR THE GROUP, AND ANALYZE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE CONSERVATION STATUS OF THESE SPECIES. WE DETECTED FOUR CONSERVATION HOTSPOTS FOR PARROTS: TWO IN THE NEOTROPICS AND TWO IN OCEANIA, ALL OF THEM FACING DIFFERENT DEGREES OF THREAT IN REGARD OF CURRENT HABITAT LOSS AND AGRICULTURAL TRENDS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE FUTURE OF THE GROUP IS SUBJECT TO POLICYMAKING IN SPECIFIC REGIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHEASTERN ANDES AND THE ATLANTIC FOREST. IN ADDITION, WE PREDICTED THAT AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION WILL HAVE A FURTHER NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE CONSERVATION STATUS OF PARROTS, PUSHING MANY PARROT SPECIES TO THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. OUR RESULTS HAVE CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS BY RECOMMENDING PROTECTED AREAS IN SPECIFIC PARROT CONSERVATION HOTSPOTS.

LIKE OTHER ORGANISMS, THE SOIL MESO-FAUNA ARE EXPECTED TO MODIFY THEIR FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE AND LAND USE CHANGES. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED THE FUNCTIONAL RESPONSES OF COLLEMBOLA, ONE OF THE MOST ABUNDANT AND ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT GROUPS OF SOIL INVERTEBRATES. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT THE GLOBAL CHANGE EXPERIMENTAL FACILITY (GCEF) IN CENTRAL GERMANY, WHERE WE TESTED THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE (AMBIENT VS. ‘FUTURE’ AS PROJECTED FOR THIS REGION FOR THE YEARS BETWEEN 2070 AND 2100), LAND USE (CONVENTIONAL FARMING, ORGANIC FARMING, INTENSIVELY-USED MEADOW, EXTENSIVELY-USED MEADOW, AND EXTENSIVELY-USED PASTURE), AND THEIR INTERACTIONS ON THE FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY (FD), COMMUNITY-WEIGHTED MEAN (CWM) TRAITS (LIFE-HISTORY, MORPHOLOGY), AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OF COLLEMBOLA, AS WELL AS THE SOIL BIOLOGICAL QUALITY-COLLEMBOLA (QBS-C) INDEX. WE FOUND THAT LAND USE WAS OVERWHELMINGLY THE DOMINANT DRIVER OF SHIFTS IN FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY, FUNCTIONAL TRAITS, AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OF COLLEMBOLA, AND OF SHIFTS IN SOIL BIOLOGICAL QUALITY. THESE SIGNIFICANT LAND USE EFFECTS WERE MAINLY DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO MAIN LAND USE TYPES, I.E. CROPLAND VS. GRASSLANDS. SPECIFICALLY, COLLEMBOLA FUNCTIONAL BIODIVERSITY AND SOIL BIOLOGICAL QUALITY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN CROPLANDS THAN GRASSLANDS. HOWEVER, NO INTERACTIVE EFFECT OF CLIMATE × LAND USE WAS FOUND IN THIS STUDY, SUGGESTING THAT LAND USE EFFECTS ON COLLEMBOLA WERE INDEPENDENT OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIO. OVERALL, OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT FUNCTIONAL RESPONSES OF COLLEMBOLA ARE HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO LAND USE INTENSIFICATION UNDER BOTH CLIMATE SCENARIOS. WE CONCLUDE THAT LAND USE CHANGES REDUCE FUNCTIONAL BIODIVERSITY AND BIOLOGICAL QUALITY OF SOIL. © 2020 ELSEVIER LTD",107847,NA,SBIOA,"WU, G.-L.; STATE KEY LABORATORY OF SOIL EROSION AND DRYLAND FARMING ON THE LOESS PLATEAU, CHINA; EMAIL: WUGAOLIN@NWSUAF.EDU.CN",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.107847,"HORIZON 2020 FRAMEWORK PROGRAMMEHORIZON 2020 FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME, H2020 EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCILEUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL, ERC DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFTDEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT, DFG, FZT 118, TH 2307/1-1 NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA, NSFC, 41722107, 41977063 BUNDESMINISTERIUM FÜR BILDUNG UND FORSCHUNGBUNDESMINISTERIUM FÜR BILDUNG UND FORSCHUNG, BMBF CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCESCHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, CAS, XDB40020302 CHINA SCHOLARSHIP COUNCILCHINA SCHOLARSHIP COUNCIL, CSC, 201406910015 MINISTERIUM FÜR WISSENSCHAFT UND WIRTSCHAFT, LAND SACHSEN-ANHALTMINISTERIUM FÜR WISSENSCHAFT UND WIRTSCHAFT, LAND SACHSEN-ANHALT HORIZON 2020HORIZON 2020, 677232 HELMHOLTZ ASSOCIATIONHELMHOLTZ ASSOCIATION DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FÜR INTEGRATIVE BIODIVERSITÄTSFORSCHUNG HALLE-JENA-LEIPZIGDEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FÜR INTEGRATIVE BIODIVERSITÄTSFORSCHUNG HALLE-JENA-LEIPZIG, IDIV",380717,SOIL BIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,29,NA,NA,ELSEVIER LTD,NA,SCOPUS,SOIL FUNCTIONAL BIODIVERSITY AND BIOLOGICAL QUALITY UNDER THREAT: INTENSIVE LAND USE OUTWEIGHS CLIMATE CHANGE,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084809802&doi=10.1016%2fj.soilbio.2020.107847&partnerID=40&md5=2cd37c40aeb38fefa404afe3a1ee2700,147,2020,"WE THANK THE HELMHOLTZ ASSOCIATION , FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND RESEARCH , THE STATE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND ECONOMY OF SAXONY-ANHALT AND THE STATE MINISTRY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION , RESEARCH AND THE ARTS SAXONY TO FUND THE GLOBAL CHANGE EXPERIMENTAL FACILITY (GCEF) PROJECT.

MONITORING ENVIRONMENTAL SOUND MAY OFFER A NOVEL METHOD FOR RAPID BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT. CHANGES IN SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES AT A GIVEN LOCATION ARE REFLECTED IN THE SITE'S ACOUSTIC ENERGY, TERMED THE SOUNDSCAPE. SOUNDSCAPES CAN BE READILY DESCRIBED USING ACOUSTIC INDICES; METRICS BASED ON OBJECTIVE FEATURES OF RECORDINGS SUCH AS PITCH AND AMPLITUDE.

USING 84 H OF AUDIO RECORDINGS COVERING 315 DAWNS FROM 43 SITES, COUPLED WITH BIRD ASSEMBLAGE AND VEGETATION DATA COLLECTED IN THE FIELD, WE DEMONSTRATE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ACOUSTIC INDICES AND AVIAN SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE. IN CONTRAST WITH MANY PREVIOUS STUDIES, WE FOUND THAT SITES WITH HIGH BIRD SPECIES-RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE HAD LESS EVEN SOUNDSCAPES (I.E. ACOUSTIC ENERGY WAS LESS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG FREQUENCIES) COMPARED WITH SITES WITH LOW SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE. CRUCIALLY, THESE PATTERNS WERE COHERENT ACROSS MULTIPLE ACOUSTIC INDICES, AND ACROSS HABITAT TYPES, EMPHASISING THEIR UTILITY FOR MONITORING. ACOUSTIC INDICES SENSITIVE TO THE FREQUENCIES AT WHICH BIRDS SING ARE MOST USEFUL FOR MONITORING AVIAN COMMUNITIES; THE ACOUSTIC EVENNESS INDEX, BIOPHONY INDEX, AND THE BIOPHONY COMPONENT OF THE NORMALISED DIFFERENCE SOUNDSCAPE INDEX EXHIBITED THE STRONGEST RELATIONSHIP WITH SPECIES RICHNESS.

BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS INFLUENCE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, RESULTING IN SPECIES EXTINCTIONS AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS. TO MITIGATE THE PET TRADE INVASION RISK, INTERVENTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO PREVENT TRADE IN NON-NATIVE ANIMALS WITH HIGH INVASION POTENTIAL, IMPULSE OR ILL-INFORMED PURCHASES OF NON-NATIVE PETS BY INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY RELEASE THESE ANIMALS, AND THE DELIBERATE RELEASE OF NON-NATIVE ANIMALS BY PET OWNERS. INTERVENTIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PREVENT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NON-NATIVE ANIMALS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY PET OWNERS (E.G., EUTHANASIA). THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INTERVENTIONS DEPENDS ON THE SUPPORT OF PET OWNERS AND THE PUBLIC IN THE FORM OF POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR, AND COMPLIANCE WITH, INTERVENTIONS. IN 2017–2018, USING BOTH MAIL AND ONLINE SURVEYS, WE MEASURED THE SUPPORT OF 1,171 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND 550 OWNERS OF NON-NATIVE PETS IN FLORIDA, USA, FOR 7 DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS TO MITIGATE THE PET TRADE INVASION RISK, AND WE INVESTIGATED DETERMINANTS OF THIS SUPPORT. WE FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS' SUPPORT FOR INTERVENTIONS DEPENDED ON THEIR CONCERN RELATED TO THE INVASION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PET TRADE, TRUST IN GOVERNMENT TO MANAGE THE PET TRADE, PERCEPTIONS OF HOW EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WOULD BE IN MITIGATING THE PET TRADE INVASION RISK, AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS.

RIPARIAN RESERVES (AREAS OF NATIVE FOREST ALONG WATERWAYS) HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MAINTAIN FOREST BIODIVERSITY AND ASSOCIATED ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES WITHIN THESE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. USING ACOUSTIC SAMPLING, WE INVESTIGATED THE VALUE OF RIPARIAN RESERVES FOR INSECTIVOROUS BATS IN OIL PALM PLANTATIONS IN SABAH, MALAYSIAN BORNEO. WE COMPARED GENERAL BAT ACTIVITY, FORAGING ACTIVITY, AND SPECIES OCCUPANCY BETWEEN RIPARIAN AREAS IN FOREST AND RIPARIAN RESERVES IN OIL PALM PLANTATIONS. OVERALL BAT ACTIVITY VARIED LITTLE BETWEEN RIPARIAN RESERVES IN OIL PALM AND RIPARIAN FOREST. RATHER, ACTIVITY WAS GREATEST IN AREAS WITH A HIGH FOREST CANOPY, IRRESPECTIVE OF HOW MUCH FOREST WAS AVAILABLE WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE RIPARIAN RESERVE. BAT FORAGING ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS THE OCCUPANCY OF TWO SPECIES, WAS GREATEST IN THE FOREST SITES, AND WHILE BATS WERE DETECTED IN THE OIL PALM RIPARIAN RESERVES, BOTH FORAGING AND OCCUPANCY WERE MORE ASSOCIATED WITH TOPOGRAPHIC RUGGEDNESS THAN FOREST AMOUNT OR HEIGHT. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT HABITAT STRUCTURE WITHIN RIPARIAN RESERVES MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN RESERVE SIZE FOR SUPPORTING INSECTIVOROUS BAT DIVERSITY WITHIN OIL PALM LANDSCAPES.

INDIVIDUAL LANDOWNERS CAN PLAY DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPORTANT ROLES BY ESTABLISHING PRIVATE PARKS AND MANAGING THEM WITH BIODIVERSITY-FOCUSED OBJECTIVES. HOWEVER, SEVERAL CONSTRAINTS HINDER THE EXPANSION OF SUCH INITIATIVES, AND LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR EXTENT, CHARACTERISTICS AND KEYS FOR SUCCESS. HERE, WE PROVIDE INSIGHTS ON THE CONDITIONS THAT FAVOURED THE ESTABLISHMENT AND CONSERVATION OUTCOMES OF A PRIVATE RESERVE IN CENTRAL SPAIN WHOSE MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN FULLY CONSERVATION-ORIENTED FOR THE PAST TWO DECADES. WE REPORT ON THE ACTIONS IMPLEMENTED TO ACCOMPLISH FOUR KEY TARGETS THAT AIMED AT PROTECTING AND ENHANCING WILDLIFE POPULATIONS, AND ON THE LANDHOLDER'S MOTIVATIONS TO DEVOTE HIS PERSONAL RESOURCES TO PURSUE THIS GOAL. AFTER ACQUIRING THE LAND, THE LANDOWNER HAS MADE EFFORTS TO RESTORE NATIVE WILDLIFE POPULATIONS AFTER DECADES OF POACHING AND INTENSIVE CATTLE RAISING. KEY ACTIONS INCLUDED RE-ESTABLISHING DEGRADED VEGETATION AND FOSTERING KEYSTONE RABBIT POPULATIONS TO SUSTAIN CARNIVORE POPULATIONS. WATER BODIES ARE MAINTAINED TO PROVIDE DRINKING POINTS AND FOSTER AQUATIC ANIMAL POPULATIONS; NEST BOXES TARGET BIRDS AND BATS. MANY ACTIONS RESULTED FROM ADVICE FROM MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION OFFICERS, ACADEMICS, LOCAL RESIDENTS AND NGOS. THE ESTATE'S FORMAL CONSERVATION STATUS HAS MADE IT A PARTNER IN MAJOR CONSERVATION PROJECTS, INCLUDING REPEATED RELEASES OF CAPTIVELY BRED IBERIAN LYNX. THE LANDOWNER'S DETERMINATION FOR LONG-TERM CONSERVATION WAS FORMALISED THROUGH A LEGAL PROTECTED-AREA STATUS. THE CONDITION THAT DROVE THE CREATION OF THE RESERVE WAS THE LANDOWNER'S INTRINSIC MOTIVATION, WHICH RESULTED FROM CONSERVATION ETHIC, PERSONAL IDENTITY AND THE DESIRE TO SHARE AND EDUCATE ABOUT THE MULTIPLE VALUES OF NATURE. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL EXTERNAL CONDITIONS, SUCH AS ACCESSIBILITY AND APPROPRIATE RESERVE SIZE (BIOPHYSICAL CONDITIONS), THE LACK OF NEED FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES (ECONOMIC), A POSITIVE AND PRO-ACTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS (SOCIAL-CULTURAL), THE PROTECTED-AREA STATUS AND THE CAPACITY TO MAKE DECISIONS INDEPENDENTLY (GOVERNANCE-RELATED), HAVE HELPED SUSTAIN THE PROJECT.

WE RECORDED PLANT SIZE, SEED WEIGHT, SEED SET, SEEDLING EMERGENCE AND MORTALITY AS PROXIES OF PLANT FITNESS. APPLYING REGRESSION MODELS AND PATH ANALYSIS (D-SEPARATION) APPROACHES WE OBSERVED THAT INCREASING GRAZING REDUCED SEED SET AND SEEDLING EMERGENCE, AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SEEDLING MORTALITY.

IN THIS STUDY, WE USE CAMERA TRAPS TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE INVASIVE WILD BOAR HAD AN EFFECT ON THE MEDIUM-SIZED MAMMAL COMMUNITY OF A PROTECTED AREA IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL. BASED ON PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORDS, WE EVALUATED WHETHER THE PRESENCE AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF WILD BOAR WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASE IN DIVERSITY OR CHANGE IN ACTIVITY OF MEDIUM-SIZED MAMMALS. ALL COMPARISONS WERE MADE BETWEEN SAMPLES WHERE WILD BOAR WERE PRESENT OR ABSENT. THE RECORDS OF EACH CAMERA DURING A SEASON WERE CONSIDERED A SAMPLE. THE WILD BOAR WAS THE FOURTH MOST COMMON SPECIES IN THE STUDY AREA BEING PRESENT IN 7.8% OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORDS. THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF MAMMALS WAS NOT NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF WILD BOAR AND MOST COMMON SPECIES DID NOT EXHIBIT CHANGES IN THE DAILY ACTIVITY PATTERN. HOWEVER, WE RECORDED AN INCREASE IN THE TIME ELAPSED BETWEEN AN OBSERVATION OF WILD BOAR AND THE RECORD OF THE NEXT SPECIES RELATIVE TO THE AVERAGE LATENCY PERIOD OBSERVED AMONG OTHER MAMMALIAN SPECIES. THIS AVERAGE LATENCY PERIOD WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OBSERVED IN THE CASE OF LARGE PREDATORS SUCH AS PUMA, AND ITS INCREASE COULD BE REFLECTIVE PARTLY OF THE AVOIDANCE OF NATIVE SPECIES TO WILD BOAR. NEVERTHELESS, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EFFECT OF INVASIVE WILD BOAR ON THE MAMMAL COMMUNITY IS NOT LARGE AS EXPECTED. © 2020 SILVEIRA DE OLIVEIRA ET AL.

THERE IS INCREASING INTEREST IN MITIGATING THIS BIODIVERSITY LOSS BY ADDING TOPOGRAPHIC HABITAT TO THESE STRUCTURES, AND/OR SEEDING THEM WITH HABITAT-FORMING SPECIES. SETTLEMENT TILE EXPERIMENTS, COMPARING COLONISATION OF SPECIES TO MORE AND LESS COMPLEX HABITATS, HAVE BEEN USED TO INFORM ECO-ENGINEERING INTERVENTIONS PRIOR TO THEIR LARGE-SCALE IMPLEMENTATION. MOST STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON APPLYING ONE TYPE OF INTERVENTION (EITHER ADDING HABITAT STRUCTURE OR SEEDING WITH NATIVE ORGANISMS), SO IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THERE ARE GREATER BENEFITS TO BIODIVERSITY WHEN MULTIPLE INTERVENTIONS ARE COMBINED. USING A FULLY ORTHOGONAL EXPERIMENT, WE ASSESSED THE INDEPENDENT AND INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF HABITAT STRUCTURE (FLAT VS. CREVICE/RIDGES) AND SEEDING WITH NATIVE OYSTERS (UNSEEDED VS. SEEDED) ON THE BIODIVERSITY OF FOUR DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS (SESSILE AND MOBILE TAXA, CRYPTOBENTHIC AND PELAGIC FISHES). CONCRETE TILES (FLAT UNSEEDED, FLAT SEEDED, COMPLEX UNSEEDED AND COMPLEX SEEDED) WERE DEPLOYED AT TWO SITES IN SYDNEY HARBOUR AND MONITORED OVER 12 MONTHS, FOR THE SURVIVAL AND COLONISATION OF OYSTERS AND THE SPECIES DENSITY AND ABUNDANCES OF THE FOUR FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. THE SURVIVAL OF SEEDED OYSTERS WAS GREATER ON THE COMPLEX THAN FLAT TILES, AT ONE OF THE TWO SITES, DUE TO THE PROTECTIVE ROLE OF CREVICES. DESPITE THIS, AFTER 12 MONTHS, THE SPECIES DENSITY OF SESSILE INVERTEBRATES AND THE PERCENTAGE COVER OF SEEDED AND COLONISING OYSTERS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN COMPLEX AND SEEDED TILES EACH OF WHICH SUPPORTED MORE OF THESE VARIABLES THAN THE FLAT UNSEEDED TILES. IN CONTRAST, THE SPECIES DENSITY OF MOBILE INVERTEBRATES AND CRYPTOBENTHIC FISHES AND THE MAXN OF PELAGIC FISHES, AT 1 MONTH, WERE ONLY POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BY SEEDING WITH OYSTERS, WHICH PROVIDED FOOD AS WELL AS HABITAT. WITHIN THE COMPLEX SEEDED AND UNSEEDED TILES, THERE WAS A GREATER SPECIES DENSITY OF SESSILE TAXA, SURVIVAL AND PERCENTAGE COVER OF OYSTERS IN THE CREVICES, WHICH WERE MORE HUMID AND DARKER AT MONTH 12, HAD LOWER HIGH TEMPERATURE EXTREMES AT MONTHS 1 AND 12, THAN ON THE RIDGES OR FLAT TILES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ECOENGINEERING PROJECTS WHICH SEEK TO MAXIMISE THE BIODIVERSITY OF MULTIPLE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS ON SEAWALLS, SHOULD APPLY A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MICROHABITATS AND HABITAT-FORMING SPECIES, TO ALTER THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AVAILABLE TO ORGANISMS. © 2020 STRAIN ET AL.

WITH THE PRESENT RATE OF DEFORESTATION UNLIKELY TO SUBSIDE, SECONDARY FORESTS THAT REGENERATE ON ABANDONED AGRICULTURAL LAND MAY PROVIDE AN OPTION FOR SAFEGUARDING BIODIVERSITY. WHILE SPECIES RICHNESS (SR) MAY RECOVER AS SECONDARY FORESTS GET OLDER, THE EXTENT TO WHICH PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY (PD)—THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY PRESENT IN A COMMUNITY—IS CONSERVED IS LESS CLEAR.

WHILE PRESERVING PRIMARY TROPICAL FORESTS REMAINS A CORE CONSERVATION GOAL, OUR RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF SECONDARY FOREST IN MAINTAINING TROPICAL FOREST BIODIVERSITY. BIODIVERSITY RECOVERY DIFFERS BETWEEN OLD AND NEW WORLD SECONDARY FORESTS AND WITH PROXIMITY TO PRIMARY FOREST, HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED TO CONSIDER LOCAL OR REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AND SPECIES CHARACTERISTICS, ESPECIALLY RESILIENCE TO FOREST DEGRADATION AND DISPERSAL CAPABILITY.

HOWEVER, DROUGHT IMPACTS ON POPULATIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, IN PART, BECAUSE HABITAT REFUGES CAN BUFFER ORGANISMS FROM HARSH ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. IN A GLOBAL CHANGE CONTEXT, MORE EXTREME DROUGHTS MAY TURN PREVIOUSLY SUITABLE HABITATS INTO ECOLOGICAL TRAPS, WHERE VULNERABLE SPECIES CAN NO LONGER PERSIST. HERE, WE EXPLORE THE IMPACTS OF CALIFORNIA'S RECENT RECORD-BREAKING DROUGHT ON ENDANGERED JUVENILE COHO SALMON. WE ESTIMATED THE VARIABILITY OF CUMULATIVE SALMON SURVIVAL USING MARK–RECAPTURE OF NEARLY 20,000 TAGGED FISH IN INTERMITTENT STREAM POOLS DURING A 7-YEAR PERIOD ENCOMPASSING DROUGHT AND NON-DROUGHT CONDITIONS. WE THEN DETERMINED THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL HABITAT, STREAMFLOW, PRECIPITATION, LANDSCAPE, AND BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAY LIMIT SURVIVAL DURING DROUGHT. OUR MOST STRIKING RESULT WAS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF POOLS WITH REDUCED OR ZERO SURVIVAL DURING DROUGHT YEARS AND A COINCIDENT INCREASE IN SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN SURVIVAL AMONG STUDY REACHES. IN NEARLY HALF OF THE STREAM POOLS, SALMON SURVIVAL DURING DROUGHT WAS SIMILAR TO MEAN SURVIVAL OF POOLS ASSESSED DURING NON-DROUGHT YEARS, INDICATING SOME POOLS HAD REMARKABLE RESISTANCE (ABILITY TO WITHSTAND DISTURBANCE) TO EXTREME DROUGHT. LOWER SURVIVAL WAS MOST ATTRIBUTABLE TO LONGER DURATION OF DISCONNECTION BETWEEN UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM HABITATS, A CONSEQUENCE OF INCREASING DROUGHT SEVERITY. OUR RESULTS NOT ONLY SUGGEST THAT MANY POOLS SUSTAIN JUVENILE SALMON IN NON-DROUGHT YEARS TRANSITION INTO ECOLOGICAL TRAPS DURING DROUGHT BUT ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT SOME POOLS SERVE AS REFUGES EVEN UNDER EXTREME DROUGHT CONDITIONS. PROJECTED INCREASES IN DROUGHT SEVERITY THAT LEAD TO LONGER DROUGHTS AND GREATER HABITAT FRAGMENTATION COULD TRANSFORM AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF SUITABLE HABITATS INTO ECOLOGICAL TRAPS. PREDICTING FUTURE IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON COHO SALMON AND OTHER SENSITIVE SPECIES WILL REQUIRE IDENTIFICATION AND PROTECTION OF DROUGHT REFUGES AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT PREVENT FURTHER HABITAT FRAGMENTATION. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

AGGREGATING DATA INTO DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES CAN CONTROL FOR SUCH DIFFERENCES AND PROVIDE A ROBUST FRAMEWORK FOR MONITORING DISTRIBUTION TRENDS. WE USED A QUANTITATIVE, MULTI-SCALE ASSESSMENT TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL DRIVERS OF DISTRIBUTION CHANGE FOR 60 FISH SPECIES AT THREE SPATIAL SCALES, USING 503 UNIQUE SAMPLING EVENTS CONDUCTED BETWEEN 1931 AND 2019 IN A STREAM BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT (FRENCH CREEK, PENNSYLVANIA, U.S.A). TRENDS DELINEATED AT MULTIPLE SCALES DEMONSTRATED THAT ONLY ONE CYPRINID SPECIES CONSISTENTLY DECLINED THROUGH TIME. IN CONTRAST, SEVERAL SPECIES, PARTICULARLY CENTRARCHIDS (BASS AND SUNFISH), APPEARED TO INCREASE WITH TIME. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE FOR SPECIES’ INCREASES VARIED AMONG THE DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES, AND OUR OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT DIFFERENCES IN EFFORT AND DETECTION ACROSS TIME PERIODS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO PATTERNS OF SPECIES INCREASES. THERE WAS AGREEMENT AMONG SCALES THAT AGRICULTURAL LAND USE, NON-NATIVE BROWN TROUT (SALMO TRUTTA), AND ANTHROPOGENIC BARRIERS DID NOT EXPLAIN PATTERNS IN BIODIVERSITY CHANGE FROM THE DISTRIBUTION TRENDS IN THIS STUDY. THE LACK OF SPECIES DECLINES IS LIKELY DUE TO THE LIMITED LEVELS OF HISTORICAL IMPACTS IN THE WATERSHED COMPARED WITH OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE REGION THAT EXPERIENCED MORE ACUTE POLLUTION BOTTLENECKS. SPECIES INCREASES WERE MOST PREVALENT FOR SPORTFISH AND BAITFISH SPECIES, SUGGESTING THAT DISTRIBUTION INCREASES WERE HUMAN MEDIATED.

ANURAN LARVAE CAN BE HIGHLY DIVERSE, CAN REACH HIGH BIOMASS AND CAN PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN TROPICAL STREAMS; YET, COMPARED TO THE ADULT FROG COMMUNITIES, RELATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW LARVAL COMMUNITIES RESPOND TO DISTURBANCE. INFORMATION ON LARVAE IS HIGHLY RELEVANT FOR AMPHIBIAN CONSERVATION BECAUSE LARVAE REPRESENT DIRECT EVIDENCE OF BREEDING AND THUS PROVIDE A GOOD INDICATOR OF SPECIES PERSISTENCE IN DISTURBED HABITATS. WE STUDIED TADPOLE ASSEMBLAGES IN RANOMAFANA, SOUTHEASTERN PART OF MADAGASCAR, IN STREAMS IN A DISTURBED FOREST (PREVIOUSLY LOGGED FOREST), AT “FOREST EDGE” (STREAMS EMBEDDED IN MATRIX NEARBY FOREST BLOCKS), AND COMPARED THESE TO COMMUNITIES IN A PRIMARY FOREST. WE SAMPLED TADPOLES AT THE MICROHABITAT LEVEL (“POOLS” AND “RIFFLES”) IN 9 STREAMS. WE RECORDED 27 SPECIES WITH A MAXIMUM OF 17 SPECIES/STREAM RECORDED AT EDGE. THE THREE HABITATS HARBORED DIFFERENT ASSEMBLAGES, BUT, AS COULD BE EXPECTED, MORE SIMILARITIES EXISTED AMONG FOREST HABITATS THAN BETWEEN FOREST AND NON-FOREST HABITATS. THE MOST AND THE LEAST DIVERSE COMMUNITIES WERE RECORDED AT EDGE AND IN THE DISTURBED FOREST, RESPECTIVELY. ASSEMBLAGES WERE DOMINATED BY ONE GENERALIST SPECIES, AND CHANGES IN COMMUNITIES WERE MOSTLY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN FOREST SPECIALISTS, WHICH EITHER DECREASED IN DISTURBED FOREST OR WERE REPLACED BY EDGE SPECIALISTS OUTSIDE FOREST. ALTHOUGH SPECIES RICHNESS VARIED, RELATIVE ABUNDANCES WERE MAINTAINED AMONG HABITATS, SUGGESTING POTENTIAL COMPENSATORY MECHANISMS IN TADPOLE BIOMASS. COMMUNITY STRUCTURE CHANGED AT THE MICROHABITAT LEVEL: POOL ENVIRONMENTS USUALLY HARBORED RELATIVELY HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE THAN RIFFLES.

ANTICIPATING WHETHER THIS TREND CAN BE REVERTED UNDER FUTURE SCENARIOS IS KEY TO SUPPORTING POLICY DECISIONS.

MAMMAL HABITAT DECLINED GLOBALLY BY 5%–16% DEPENDING ON THE SCENARIO. AFRICA (WITH DECLINES UP TO 25%) AND SOUTH AMERICA WERE THE MOST AFFECTED REGIONS. AFRICAN INSECTIVORES, PRIMATES, AUSTRALIAN CARNIVOROUS MARSUPIALS AND MARSUPIAL MOLES, AND SOUTH AMERICAN OPOSSUMS DECLINED THE MOST. TACKLING THIS LOSS WOULD REQUIRE A MIX OF ACTIONS ACROSS SCALES, INCLUDING A GLOBAL SHIFT TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY, ADDRESSING LAND-USE CHANGE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, AND HELPING ENDEMIC SPECIES TRACK CLIMATE CHANGE IN SOUTH AMERICA. HUMAN PRESSURE IS THE MAIN DRIVER OF MODERN BIODIVERSITY LOSS. BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ARE UNIVERSALLY AGREED TO BE A PRECIOUS RESOURCE FOR HUMAN SOCIETIES AND ESSENTIAL FOR HUMAN SURVIVAL. GLOBAL SCENARIOS OF SOCIETAL DEVELOPMENT CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL POLICIES ON NATIONS' ABILITIES TO SECURE ACCESS TO FOOD, ENERGY, AND RESOURCES, BUT THEY COMMONLY IGNORE IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY. IT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT WE BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND ANTICIPATE THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THESE DECISIONS ON BIODIVERSITY. WE FIND THAT A SINGLE STRATEGY MIGHT HAVE WIDELY DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY IN DIFFERENT WORLD REGIONS. ALSO, SEEMINGLY VALID STRATEGIES (FROM A SOCIETAL PERSPECTIVE) COULD HAVE SERIOUS NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS ON MAMMALS, WITH EXPECTED LOSSES OF BETWEEN 5% AND 16%.

POPULATIONS AND SPECIES EXTINCTIONS HAVE SEVERE IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY THROUGH THE DEGRADATION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. HERE WE ASSESS THE EXTINCTION CRISIS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. WE EXAMINE 29,400 SPECIES OF TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES, AND DETERMINE WHICH ARE ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION BECAUSE THEY HAVE FEWER THAN 1,000 INDIVIDUALS. THERE ARE 515 SPECIES ON THE BRINK (1.7% OF THE EVALUATED VERTEBRATES). AROUND 94% OF THE POPULATIONS OF 77MAMMAL AND BIRD SPECIES ON THE BRINK HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE LAST CENTURY. ASSUMING ALL SPECIES ON THE BRINK HAVE SIMILAR TRENDS, MORE THAN 237,000 POPULATIONS OF THOSE SPECIES HAVE VANISHED SINCE 1900. WE CONCLUDE THE HUMAN-CAUSED SIXTH MASS EXTINCTION IS LIKELY ACCELERATING FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST, MANY OF THE SPECIES THAT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO THE BRINK WILL LIKELY BECOME EXTINCT SOON. SECOND, THE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE SPECIES HIGHLY COINCIDES WITH HUNDREDS OF OTHER ENDANGERED SPECIES, SURVIVING IN REGIONS WITH HIGH HUMAN IMPACTS, SUGGESTING ONGOING REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY COLLAPSES. THIRD, CLOSE ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS OF SPECIES ON THE BRINK TEND TO MOVE OTHER SPECIES TOWARD ANNIHILATION WHEN THEY DISAPPEAR-EXTINCTION BREEDS EXTINCTIONS.

MINING THREATENS MANY SPECIES WORLDWIDE THROUGH LARGE-SCALE HABITAT MODIFICATION, AND ARTIFICIAL REFUGES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS A METHOD TO OFFSET THE RESULTING HABITAT LOSS. HERE, WE EXAMINED THE MICROCLIMATIC, PHYSICAL, AND BIOTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF NATURAL DENS OCCUPIED BY THE NORTHERN QUOLL (DASYURUS HALLUCATUS)—AN ENDANGERED MARSUPIAL THREATENED BY HABITAT LOSS—AND COMPARED THESE TO (A) SUPERFICIALLY SIMILAR UNOCCUPIED CREVICES, AND (B) ARTIFICIAL DENS CREATED BY MINING COMPANIES FOR NORTHERN QUOLLS. NORTHERN QUOLLS OCCUPIED NATURAL DENS THAT WERE COOLER AND DEEPER THAN UNOCCUPIED CREVICES, LIKELY TO AVOID LETHAL AIR TEMPERATURES AS WELL AS PREDATORS. ARTIFICIAL DENS PROVIDED SIMILAR THERMAL PROPERTIES TO OCCUPIED DENS, BUT LACKED KEY CHARACTERISTICS IN HAVING SHALLOWER DEN CAVITIES, LESS COMPLEX SURROUNDING HABITAT, INCREASED FERAL CAT VISITATION, AND LESS SMALL MAMMAL PREY COMPARED TO OCCUPIED DENS.

HERE WE PRESENT A REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE WHERE TACTICS (TECHNIQUES WHICH INFLUENCE POST-RELEASE PERFORMANCE AND PERSISTENCE) AND AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK (WHICH INCORPORATES FEEDBACK BETWEEN MONITORING AND FUTURE ACTIONS) IMPROVED REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS. ACROSS THREE SUCCESSIVE TRIALS WE INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF TACTICS ON THE EFFECTIVE SURVIVAL AND POST-RELEASE DISPERSAL OF ENDANGERED EASTERN QUOLLS (DASYURUS VIVERRINUS) REINTRODUCED INTO MULLIGANS FLAT WOODLAND SANCTUARY, AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY. FOUNDERS WERE MONITORED FOR 42 DAYS POST-RELEASE, AND PROBABILITY OF SURVIVAL AND POST-RELEASE DISPERSAL WERE TESTED AGAINST TRIAL, ORIGIN, SEX, DEN SHARING AND PRESENCE OF POUCH YOUNG. WE ADOPTED AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, USING MONITORING TO FACILITATE RAPID LEARNING AND TO IMPLEMENT INTERVENTIONS THAT IMPROVED REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS. FOUNDERS RELEASED IN THE FIRST TRIAL WERE LESS LIKELY TO SURVIVE (28.6%, N = 14) THAN THOSE FOUNDERS RELEASED THE SECOND (76.9%, N = 13) AND THIRD TRIALS (87.5%, N = 8). WE ADAPTED SEVERAL TACTICS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD TRIALS, INCLUDING THE SELECTION OF FEMALE-ONLY FOUNDERS TO AVOID ELEVATED MALE MORTALITY, AND POST-MATING RELEASES TO REDUCE STRESS. FOUNDERS THAT MOVED DENS BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS WERE LESS LIKELY TO SURVIVE, SUGGESTING THAT MINIMISING POST-RELEASE DISPERSAL CAN INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF SURVIVAL. THE PROBABILITY OF MOVING DENS WAS LOWER IN THE SECOND AND THIRD TRIALS, FOR FEMALES, AND WHEN DEN SHARING WITH ANOTHER FOUNDER. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT, THROUGH ITERATIVE TRIALS OF TACTICS INVOLVING MONITORING AND LEARNING, ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT CAN BE USED TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE SUCCESS OF REINTRODUCTION PROGRAMS. © 2020 WILSON ET AL.",E0234455,NA,POLNC,"WILSON, B.A.; FENNER SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: BELINDA.WILSON@ANU.EDU.AU",ARTICLE,10.1371/journal.pone.0234455,"AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCILAUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL, ARC, LP140100209",19326203,PLOS ONE,ENGLISH,NA,NA,14,6,NA,PUBLIC LIBRARY OF SCIENCE,32598368,SCOPUS,ADAPTING REINTRODUCTION TACTICS IN SUCCESSIVE TRIALS INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ESTABLISHMENT FOR AN ENDANGERED CARNIVORE IN A FENCED SANCTUARY,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087325025&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0234455&partnerID=40&md5=0f1e0abce5ae49c67437e95a0742ab39,15,2020,NA NA NA,PLOS ONE,none,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO;CHARLES DARWIN UNIVERSITY;CENTRAL QUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY;JAMES HUTTON INSTITUTE;FORDE COMMUNITY CENTRE;MT ROTHWELL BIODIVERSITY INTERPRETATION CENTRE,NOTREPORTED;FENNER SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY;NOTREPORTED,NA,"WILSON BA, 2020, PLOS ONE","WILSON BA, 2020, PLOS ONE"

INVASIVE BROWN (RATTUS NORVEGICUS) AND BLACK (R. RATTUS) RATS, IN PARTICULAR, ARE LEADING DRIVERS OF EXTINCTION ON ISLANDS, ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF SEABIRDS WHERE >50% OF ALL EXTINCTIONS HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO RAT PREDATION. ERADICATION IS THE PRIMARY FORM OF INVASIVE RAT MANAGEMENT, YET THIS STRATEGY HAS RESULTED IN A ~10-38% FAILURE RATE ON ISLANDS GLOBALLY. GENETIC TOOLS CAN HELP INFORM IAS MANAGEMENT, BUT SUCH APPLICATIONS TO DATE HAVE BEEN LARGELY REACTIVE, TIME-CONSUMING, AND COSTLY. HERE, WE DEVELOPED A GENOTYPING-IN-THOUSANDS BY SEQUENCING (GT-SEQ) PANEL FOR RAPID SPECIES IDENTIFICATION AND POPULATION ASSIGNMENT OF INVASIVE BROWN AND BLACK RATS (RAPIDRAT) IN HAIDA GWAII, AN ARCHIPELAGO COMPRISING ~150 ISLANDS OFF THE CENTRAL COAST OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA. WE CONSTRUCTED AN OPTIMIZED PANEL OF 443 SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS (SNPS) USING PREVIOUSLY GENERATED DOUBLE-DIGEST RESTRICTION-SITE ASSOCIATED DNA (DDRAD) GENOTYPIC DATA (27,686 SNPS) FROM BROWN (N = 295) AND BLACK RATS (N = 241) SAMPLED THROUGHOUT HAIDA GWAII. THE INFORMATIVENESS OF THIS PANEL FOR IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS TO SPECIES AND ISLAND OF ORIGIN WAS VALIDATED RELATIVE TO THE DDRAD RESULTS; IN ALL COMPARISONS, ADMIXTURE COEFFICIENTS AND POPULATION ASSIGNMENTS ESTIMATED USING RAPIDRAT WERE CONSISTENT. TO DEMONSTRATE APPLICATION, 20 INDIVIDUALS FROM NOVEL INVASIONS OF THREE ISLANDS (AGGLOMERATE, HOTSPRING, RAMSAY) WERE GENOTYPED USING RAPIDRAT, ALL OF WHICH WERE CONFIDENTLY ASSIGNED (>98.5% PROBABILITY) TO FARADAY AND MURCHISON ISLANDS AS PUTATIVE SOURCE POPULATIONS. THESE RESULTS INDICATED THAT A PREVIOUS ERADICATION ON HOTSPRING ISLAND WAS CONDUCTED AT AN INAPPROPRIATE GEOGRAPHIC SCALE; FUTURE MANAGEMENT SHOULD EXPAND THE ERADICATION UNIT TO INCLUDE NEIGHBORING ISLANDS TO PREVENT RE-INVASION. OVERALL, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT RAPIDRAT IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR MANAGING INVASIVE RAT POPULATIONS IN HAIDA GWAII AND PROVIDED A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR GT-SEQ PANEL DEVELOPMENT FOR INFORMING BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN OTHER SYSTEMS.

VERY FEW ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS INCORPORATE HUMAN INTERESTS IN CONSERVATION PRIORITIZATION, CREATING ASYNCHRONY BETWEEN PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION. FOR CONSERVATION ACTIONS TO BE LOGISTICALLY FEASIBLE, MULTIPLE CRITERIA INCLUDING ECOLOGICAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS MUST BE CONSIDERED. UNDERSTANDING HOW THESE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS INTERACT SPATIALLY IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR GAUGING THE POTENTIAL FOR CONSERVATION SUCCESS. HERE, WE USE A GUILD OF SELECT MAMMALIAN CARNIVORES (WILD CANIDS AND HYENAS) IN INDIA TO (I) GENERATE DISTRIBUTION MAPS AT THE SPATIAL SCALE OF ADMINISTRATIVE SUB-DISTRICTS, THAT ARE RELEVANT TO MANAGEMENT, (II) EXAMINE ECOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND BIOGEOGRAPHIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR DISTRIBUTION, ASSESS KEY THREATS, AND IDENTIFY AREAS IMPORTANT FOR THEIR CONSERVATION, (III) USE PRIORITIZATION TOOLS FOR BALANCING HABITAT CONSERVATION, HUMAN NEEDS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND (IV) EVALUATE THE SPATIAL CONGRUENCE BETWEEN AREAS WITH HIGH CONSERVATION POTENTIAL, AND AREAS CURRENTLY IN FOCUS FOR PROTECTION EFFORTS, CONSERVATION INVESTMENTS, AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. WE FIND THAT THE CURRENT PROTECTED AREA SYSTEM DOES NOT ADEQUATELY COVER OR REPRESENT DIVERSE HABITATS, THAT THERE IS IMMENSE POTENTIAL FOR STATES TO INCREASE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS TOWARDS ALTERNATIVE CONSERVATION STRATEGIES, AND, MOST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS MAY BE POTENTIALLY JEOPARDIZING IMPORTANT CARNIVORE HABITATS WHERE THE TWO OVERLAP.

OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO SYNTHESIZE THE PROVISION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN FORESTS, SHRUBLANDS AND WOODLANDS DOMINATED BY UNGULATES (WILDLIFE OR LIVESTOCK) IN MEDITERRANEAN ENVIRONMENTS. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC SEMI-QUANTITATIVE REVIEW (N = 262 STUDIES) ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE AREA FOR THE 1991−2018 PERIOD. MOST STUDIES FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING SERVICES (80.35 % OF ALL STUDIES), WITH BIODIVERSITY (49.11 %) AND PLANT RECRUITMENT (18.15 %) AS THE MOST STUDIED SERVICES. A GREAT NUMBER OF STUDIES ADDRESSED PLANT BIODIVERSITY PRESERVATION (63.40 % OF STUDIES ON BIODIVERSITY). SURPRISINGLY, WE FOUND A LOW NUMBER OF STUDIES ON CULTURAL (7.02 %) AND REGULATORY (5.26 %) SERVICES. REGARDING THE DIRECTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF UNGULATE EFFECTS ON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, 67 STUDIES (25.57 %) SHOWED POSITIVE EFFECTS AND 86 STUDIES (32.82 %) MENTIONED NEGATIVE EFFECTS (DISSERVICES). MOST STUDIES THAT SHOWED POSITIVE EFFECTS FOCUSED ON BIODIVERSITY, MAINLY VEGETATION AND BIRDS, AND WILDFIRE PREVENTION. HOWEVER, MOST STUDIES REPORTING NEGATIVE EFFECTS WERE ALSO BASED ON BIODIVERSITY LOSS (MAINLY VEGETATION) AND PLANT RECRUITMENT FAILURE. DISTRIBUTION OF SERVICES REMAINED SIMILAR ACROSS REGIONS AND SPECIES BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF UNGULATES WERE REPORTED MAINLY IN SHRUBLANDS AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS WERE REPORTED PRIMARILY IN FORESTS AND WOODLANDS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT UNGULATE DENSITY IS KEY TO EXPLAIN THE DIRECTION OF UNGULATE EFFECTS ON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, ONLY 9.51 % OF ALL STUDIES CONSIDERED DIFFERENT ESTIMATES OF HERBIVORE PRESSURE AND JUST 7.22 % OF ALL STUDIES CONSIDERED DIFFERENT CONTRASTED DENSITIES IN THE ANALYSIS. OVERALL, OUR ANALYSIS OF SERVICES SHOWED A DECREASING TOLERANCE TO UNGULATE PRESSURE FROM WOODLANDS, THROUGH FORESTS, TO SHRUBLANDS. MEAN ± SE UNGULATE DENSITIES (LIVESTOCK UNITS PER HA) IN STUDIES THAT SHOWED NEGATIVE EFFECTS WERE 0.20 ± 0.01 IN SHRUBLANDS, 0.22 ± 0.01 IN FORESTS, AND 1.98 ± 1.70 IN WOODLANDS (INCLUDING DEHESAS, MONTADOS AND RANGELANDS). MANAGEMENT IN MEDITERRANEAN WOODY ECOSYSTEMS SHOULD FOCUS ON NEGLECTED SERVICES (E.G.

TO ESTABLISH THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF WILDLIFE COMMUNITIES BEFORE AND FOLLOWING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DAMS. WE EVALUATED THE IMPACTS OF THE FILLING OF THE SERRA DO FACÃO HYDROELECTRIC RESERVOIR IN THE SÃO MARCOS RIVER, CENTRAL BRAZIL, ON THE BIRD COMMUNITY. USING DATA FROM 1,145 SURVEYS ACROSS 20 SAMPLING SITES OVER 8 YEARS, 2 YEARS BEFORE AND 6 YEARS AFTER THE FILLING OF THE RESERVOIR, WE ASSESSED THE RESISTANCE, I.E. MAINTENANCE CLOSE TO AN EQUILIBRIUM STATE DURING THE DISTURBANCE, AND RESILIENCE, I.E. ABILITY TO RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL STATE FOLLOWING THE DISTURBANCE, OF THE BIRD COMMUNITY. WE USED SPATIOTEMPORAL HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN MODELS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF RESERVOIR FILLING ON FIVE COMMUNITY PARAMETERS: ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS, PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY, FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY AND SPECIES COMPOSITION. IN THE PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO RESERVOIR FILLING, THERE WAS (A) A MARKED REDUCTION IN BIRD ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS, PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY, AND (B) A REDUCTION IN THE PROPORTION OF FOREST SPECIES, COUPLED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF SAVANNA SPECIES. EXCEPT FOR BIRD ABUNDANCE, NONE OF THE OTHER COMMUNITY ATTRIBUTES RETURNED TO THEIR ORIGINAL LEVELS, EVEN AFTER 6 YEARS. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CERRADO BIRD COMMUNITIES HAVE BOTH LOW RESISTANCE AND LOW RESILIENCE TO HABITAT LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HYDROELECTRIC RESERVOIRS.

UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG ACTIONS, OUTPUTS, AND OUTCOMES CAN INFORM ON FACTORS ACTING TO FACILITATE OR HINDER CONSERVATION SUCCESS. ASSESSING THESE RELATIONSHIPS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR PROJECTS WITH BOTH SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL OBJECTIVES GIVEN THAT THEY LIKELY OPERATE THROUGH A MORE COMPLEX THEORY OF CHANGE. PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT STUDIES THAT ASSESS BOTH ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL VARIABLES CAN OFFER AN INFORMATIVE AND COST-EFFECTIVE EVALUATION METHOD FOR SUCH PROJECTS, BUT SIMULTANEOUS SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL EVALUATION IS RARELY IMPLEMENTED. USING THE CASE STUDY OF THE MARINE TURTLE CONSERVATION PROJECT IN NORTH CYPRUS, WE AIMED TO DEMONSTRATE HOW SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE PROTOCOLS CAN AID SEA TURTLE CONSERVATION EFFORTS IN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT THROUGH INFORMING ON CONNECTIONS AMONG PROJECT ACTIONS, OUTPUTS, AND OUTCOMES. OUR STUDY EMPLOYED A MIXED-METHODS PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT APPROACH INTEGRATING THREE DISTINCT DATA SOURCES: 31 PROJECT PUBLICATIONS, THE PROJECT'S LONG-TERM DATASET ON SEA TURTLE ECOLOGY, AND 26 SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH KEY INFORMANTS INCLUDING RESIDENTS, FISHERMEN, LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS, AND PROJECT STAFF. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE PROJECT HAS GENERATED A WIDE RANGE OF SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. TWO PRIMARY CONNECTIONS AMONG SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS EMERGED: 1) BRIDGING THE RESEARCH-IMPLEMENTATION GAP THROUGH DIRECTING RESEARCH INTO POLICY ACTION AND 2) ENHANCED OPERATIONAL CAPACITY AND ACHIEVEMENT OF ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES THROUGH EXTENSIVELY ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY AND GENERATING LOCAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS.

PROJECTIONS OF LAND-USE CHANGE ARE OFTEN USED TO ESTIMATE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY OF FUTURE PATHWAYS OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, SUCH ANALYSES FREQUENTLY NEGLECT THAT SPECIES CAN PERSIST IN HUMAN-MODIFIED HABITATS. OUR AIM WAS TO ESTIMATE CHANGES IN BIODIVERSITY, CONSIDERING AFFINITIES FOR MULTIPLE HABITATS, FOR THREE DIFFERENT LAND-USE SCENARIOS. TWO SCENARIOS FOCUSED ON MORE SUSTAINABLE TRAJECTORIES OF LAND-USE CHANGE, BASED ON EITHER TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS (PATHWAY A) OR SOCIETAL CHANGES (PATHWAY B), AND THE THIRD REFLECTED THE HISTORICAL OR BUSINESS-AS-USUAL TRENDS (PATHWAY 0). USING PORTUGAL AS A CASE STUDY, WE PRODUCED SPATIALLY-EXPLICIT PROJECTIONS OF LAND-USE CHANGE BASED ON THESE PATHWAYS, AND THEN WE ASSESSED THE RESULTING CHANGES IN BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION PROJECTED TO OCCUR BY 2050 IN EACH OF THE SCENARIOS. BY 2050, ALPHA AND GAMMA DIVERSITY WERE PROJECTED TO DECREASE, RELATIVE TO 2010, IN PATHWAY 0 AND INCREASE IN PATHWAYS A AND B. HOWEVER, DIFFERENT PATHWAYS FAVORED DIFFERENT SPECIES GROUPS, AND PRESENTED STRONG REGIONAL DIFFERENCES. IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT PATHWAY, LOSS OF EXTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL AREAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN BOTH NATURAL AND EXTENSIVE FOREST AREAS. IN THIS PATHWAY, FOREST SPECIES INCREASE AT THE EXPENSE OF FARMLAND SPECIES, WHILE IN THE SOCIETAL CHANGE PATHWAY THE REVERSE OCCURS, AS EXTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL AREAS WERE PROJECTED TO INCREASE. WE SHOW THAT WHILE MULTIPLE POSITIVE PATHWAYS (A AND B) FOR BIODIVERSITY CAN BE ENVISIONED, THEY WILL LEAD TO DIFFERENTIAL IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY DEPENDING ON THE TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES IN PLACE AND THE REGIONAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CONSIDERING COMPOSITIONAL ASPECTS OF BIODIVERSITY CAN BE CRITICAL IN CHOOSING THE APPROPRIATE REGIONAL LAND-USE POLICIES. © 2020 THE AUTHORS",E01028,NA,NA,"MARTINS, I.S.; LEVERHULME CENTRE FOR ANTHROPOCENE BIODIVERSITY, WENTWORTH WAY, UNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: INES.MARTINS@YORK.AC.UK",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01028,"HORIZON 2020 FRAMEWORK PROGRAMMEHORIZON 2020 FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME, H2020 H2020 MARIE SKŁODOWSKA-CURIE ACTIONSH2020 MARIE SKŁODOWSKA-CURIE ACTIONS, MSCA, 703862 SEVENTH FRAMEWORK PROGRAMMESEVENTH FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME, FP7, 603942 DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFTDEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT, DFG, FZT 118 SEVENTH FRAMEWORK PROGRAMMESEVENTH FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME, FP7 HORIZON 2020HORIZON 2020",23519894,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,7,NA,NA,ELSEVIER B.V.,NA,SCOPUS,ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE LEAD TO CONTRASTING BIODIVERSITY RESPONSES,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082534033&doi=10.1016%2fj.gecco.2020.e01028&partnerID=40&md5=1b654e595278b4b7da2962f1526f8a16,22,2020,"WE THANK JOYCE ZWARTKRUIS FOR HELPFUL INSIGHTS ON EARLIER VERSIONS OF THE ANALYSIS.

THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF SEA OTTERS ASSOCIATED WITH TOURISM AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH BENEFITS ARE REALIZED WERE EVALUATED BASED ON: (I) CHOICE-EXPERIMENT SURVEYS OF TOURISTS; AND (II) INTERVIEWS WITH TOURISM OPERATORS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL PATHWAYS UNDERPINNING SHIFTS IN FISH ASSEMBLAGES, HOWEVER, ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD, BUT COULD POTENTIALLY BE INFERRED FROM TRAIT–ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIPS. WE ADDRESSED THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP USING ECO-MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS TO EXPLAIN FISH OCCURRENCES IN OIL PALM-IMPACTED STREAMS OF THE ENDAU DRAINAGE IN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED HOW TRAITS RELATE TO DIFFERENCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH LAND-USE CHANGE. WE THEN INTEGRATE FINDINGS FROM THE ABOVE TO TEST HOW POTENTIAL PATHWAYS OF LAND-USE DRIVEN ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES CAN IMPACT SPECIES OCCURRENCES THROUGH EFFECTS ON LIFE HISTORY, FEEDING HABITS, AND MOBILITY. MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS SHOW THAT FISHES WITH SUPERIOR (UPWARD-FACING) MOUTHS AND LOW BODY MASS WERE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN OIL PALM STREAMS THAN FOREST STREAMS, AND THESE TRAITS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH GRASS-DOMINATED RIPARIAN ZONES AND REDUCED WOODY DEBRIS IN OIL PALM STREAMS, RESPECTIVELY. STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS SHOW THAT MOUTH POSITIONS STATISTICALLY MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION ON FISH SPECIES OCCURRENCES IN OIL PALM STREAMS. SPECIFICALLY, FISHES WITH SUPERIOR MOUTHS WERE MORE LIKELY TO FEED ON TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES. OUR ANALYSIS OF EASILY MEASURABLE TRAITS REVEALED PATHWAYS OF LAND-USE IMPACT THAT ARE POTENTIALLY MORE WIDELY APPLICABLE THAN CONVENTIONAL TAXA-BASED APPROACHES. FISHES WITH SUPERIOR MOUTHS TENDED TO OCCUR IN OIL PALM STREAMS AS THEY WERE ABLE TO MORE EFFECTIVELY EXPLOIT INPUTS OF TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES THAT ARE POTENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH GRASS-DOMINATED RIPARIAN VEGETATION.

IN THIS AREA, A LARGE CONCENTRATION OF GILLNET FISHERY TEMPORALLY OVERLAPS PERIODS OF THE MOST ABUNDANT OCCURRENCE OF FORAGING DIVING BIRDS. THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO SHOW HOW BYCATCH CAN IMPACT THE POPULATION OF A DIVING DUCK. TO ASSESS THIS, WE CALCULATE THE POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL (PBR) FOR THE STUDIED GREATER SCAUP POPULATION AND WE MODEL THE POPULATION CHANGE ACCORDING TO AGE-STRUCTURED MATRIX MODELS. SUMMING ALL THE AVAILABLE RECENT FIGURES ON GREATER SCAUP BYCATCH IN NORTH-WEST EUROPE YIELDS AN ESTIMATED MEAN ANNUAL TOTAL OF 3,991 INDIVIDUALS (2% OF THE FLYWAY POPULATION). FOR A BASELINE STABLE POPULATION, AN AGE-STRUCTURED MATRIX MODEL INDICATES THAT AT THIS BYCATCH LEVEL THE GREATER SCAUP POPULATION THAT WINTERS IN NORTH-WEST EUROPE WILL DECREASE BY 36% OVER THE NEXT 30 YEARS, QUALIFYING THE STATUS OF THE POPULATION AS 'VULNERABLE' ACCORDING TO IUCN CRITERIA. AS THIS POPULATION ALSO EXPERIENCES DECLINE PRIOR TO BYCATCH, THIS DECREASE WILL BE 57%, WHICH QUALIFIES THE STATUS AS 'ENDANGERED'. PBR AS AN INDICATOR OF POPULATION VITALITY DOES NOT WORK IN OUR CASE BECAUSE THE PBR-INFORMED ALLOWABLE BYCATCH VALUES HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE POPULATION. OUR RESULTS INDICATE UNAMBIGUOUSLY THAT FISHERY BYCATCH IS AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT THREATS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GREATER SCAUP'S DECLINE. WHILE RECENT DATA SUGGEST THAT SOME IMPROVEMENT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE SPECIES' STATUS OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS, MEASURES TO PROTECT GREATER SCAUP FROM BYCATCH ARE REQUIRED. THE SOLUTION SHOULD INVOLVE THE PROHIBITION OF GILLNET FISHING IN SELECTED KEY SITES AND THE USE OF MITIGATION TECHNIQUES IN OTHER AREAS. © BIRDLIFE INTERNATIONAL, 2020.",NA,NA,NA,"MARCHOWSKI, D.; ORNITHOLOGICAL STATION, POLAND; EMAIL: DOMINIKM@MIIZ.WAW.PL",ARTICLE,10.1017/S0959270919000492,NA,9592709,BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL,ENGLISH,NA,NA,4,2,176-193,CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS,NA,SCOPUS,FISHERY BYCATCH IS AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT THREATS TO THE EUROPEAN POPULATION OF GREATER SCAUP AYTHYA MARILA,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078290248&doi=10.1017%2fS0959270919000492&partnerID=40&md5=ea31dcfb04045cc4cce09a405dbd9c68,30,2020,NA NA NA,BIRD CONSERV INT,none,MUSEUM AND INSTITUTE OF ZOOLOGY;SZCZECIN UNIVERSITY;SZCZECIN UNIVERSITY;MUSEUM AND INSTITUTE OF ZOOLOGY,MARCHOWSKI;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED,NA,"MARCHOWSKI D, 2020, BIRD CONSERV INT","MARCHOWSKI D, 2020, BIRD CONSERV INT"

THIS CAN LEAD TO A GROSS UNDERESTIMATION OF SPECIES DECLINES IN RESPONSE TO HABITAT LOSS, ESPECIALLY WHEN SPECIES DECLINES ARE GRADUAL AND OCCUR OVER LONG TIME PERIODS. USING COLD WAR SPY SATELLITE IMAGES (CORONA), WE SHOW THAT A GRASSLAND KEYSTONE SPECIES, THE BOBAK MARMOT (MARMOTA BOBAK), CONTINUES TO RESPOND TO AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION THAT HAPPENED MORE THAN 50 YEARS AGO. ALTHOUGH BURROW DENSITIES OF THE BOBAK MARMOT TODAY ARE HIGHEST IN CROPLANDS, DENSITIES DECLINED MOST STRONGLY IN AREAS THAT WERE PERSISTENTLY USED AS CROPLANDS SINCE THE 1960S. THIS RESPONSE TO HISTORICAL AGRICULTURAL CONVERSION SPANS ROUGHLY EIGHT MARMOT GENERATIONS AND SUGGESTS THE LONGEST RECORDED RESPONSE OF A MAMMAL SPECIES TO AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION. WE ALSO FOUND EVIDENCE FOR REMARKABLE PHILOPATRY: NEARLY HALF OF ALL BURROWS RETAINED THEIR EXACT LOCATION SINCE THE 1960S, AND THIS WAS MOST PRONOUNCED IN GRASSLANDS.

CURRENT RATES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND THE REDUCTION OF FISH STOCKS AND FISHERIES DICTATE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF FISHERIES-RELATED ISSUES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS. THE MEDITERRANEAN MONK SEAL IS ONE OF THE MOST ENDANGERED MARINE MAMMALS ON EARTH; ITS SURVIVAL IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA IS THREATENED BY NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS WITH FISHERIES. A NATIONWIDE QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY AMONG FISHERS AND PORT POLICE AUTHORITIES WAS CARRIED OUT IN GREECE TO DESCRIBE THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES, AND TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND ASSESS THE MAGNITUDE OF NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE MONK SEAL AND THESE FISHERIES. QUESTIONNAIRE INFORMATION WAS VERIFIED BY A SECOND ROUND OF INTERVIEWS DURING LANDINGS. THE MAIN ATTRIBUTES OF THE FISHERS, THEIR FISHING BOATS, AND THEIR PRACTICES WERE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES SECTOR. OVERFISHING WAS CONSIDERED THE MAIN REASON FOR FISH-STOCK REDUCTION, AND NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS WITH MARINE MAMMALS WAS CONSIDERED THE MAIN ISSUE FOR THE FISHING SECTOR. MONK SEALS WERE PRESENT, CAUSED DAMAGE, AND GOT ACCIDENTALLY ENTANGLED IN FISHING GEAR THROUGHOUT GREECE. DAMAGE TO FISHING GEAR WAS RECORDED MAINLY DURING SPRING AND SUMMER, AND ON AVERAGE AFFECTED 21% OF ALL FISHING TRIPS AND 1% OF NETS DEPLOYED DURING A FISHING TRIP. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GENERAL AND SPECIFIC NATIONWIDE FISHERY MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION ACTIONS ARE PROPOSED.

BIOGEOGR.,1,"AIM: UNDERSTANDING WHERE AND WHY SPECIES DIVERSITY IS GEOGRAPHICALLY CONCENTRATED REMAINS A CHALLENGE IN BIOGEOGRAPHY AND MACROEVOLUTION. THIS IS TRUE FOR THE CERRADO, THE MOST BIODIVERSE TROPICAL SAVANNA IN THE WORLD, WHICH HAS EXPERIENCED PROFOUND BIODIVERSITY LOSS. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON A SINGLE METRIC (SPECIES COMPOSITION), NEGLECTING THE FACT THAT ‘SPECIES’ WITHIN THE BIOME ARE OFTEN COMPOSED OF CRYPTIC SPECIES. IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS MORE ROBUSTLY AND ACROSS MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS WE INTEGRATE FUNCTIONAL, SPATIAL AND NEW PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC DATA FOR THE CERRADO LIZARD FAUNA BY (A) MAPPING THE SPATIAL PATTERNS OF SPECIES AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; AND (B) USING ENDEMISM MEASURES TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF UNIQUE DIVERSITY. WE THEN QUANTIFY THE EXTENT TO WHICH EXISTING PROTECTED AREAS REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY. LOCATION: BRAZILIAN SAVANNA (CERRADO). METHODS: WE GENERATED SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS USING DISTRIBUTION RECORDS FOR ALL CERRADO LIZARD SPECIES. THESE, COMBINED WITH MITOCHONDRIAL DNA PHYLOGENIES AND NATURAL HISTORY DATA, ALLOWED US TO MAP SPECIES RICHNESS, PHYLOGENETIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY AND PHYLOGENETIC AND WEIGHTED ENDEMISM. PHYLOGENETIC ENDEMISM MAPS WERE THEN CROSS-REFERENCED AGAINST PROTECTED AREAS TO CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY PRESERVED WITHIN THESE AREAS. RESULTS: THE CENTRAL REGION OF THE CERRADO, A VAST AND CLIMATICALLY STABLE PLATEAU, STANDS OUT AS IMPORTANT UNDER ALL BIODIVERSITY METRICS. INCLUDING EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS IN BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT, WE DETECTED FOUR REGIONAL HOTSPOTS WITH HIGH CONCENTRATION OF SPATIALLY RESTRICTED EVOLUTIONARY DIVERSITY. PROTECTED AREAS COVER ONLY 10% OF THE CERRADO AREA AND HOLD 11.64% OF THE SUMMED PHYLOGENETIC ENDEMISM OF ALL LIZARDS IN THE BIOME. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: WE HIGHLIGHTED BOTH STABLE (CHAPADA DOS VEADEIROS AND SERRA DO ESPINHAÇO PLATEAUS) AND ENVIRONMENTALLY HETEROGENOUS REGIONS (ARAGUAIA AND TOCANTINS VALLEYS) AS HOTSPOTS OF EVOLUTIONARY DIVERSITY.

HOWEVER, MULTIPLE ECOLOGICAL BARRIERS ARE BELIEVED TO HINDER NATURAL REGENERATION OF NATIVE TREES ON DEGRADED PEATLAND AND MAKE RESTORATION EXPENSIVE. WE EVALUATED IF NATURAL PSF REGENERATION OCCURS AND WHAT FACTORS MAY INFLUENCE IT ON EIGHT DIFFERENT LAND USE AND LAND COVER (LULC) CLASSES WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISTURBANCE, INCLUDING DRAINAGE AND FIRE, IN A RETIRED ACACIA CRASSICARPA BENTH. (ACACIA) PLANTATION LANDSCAPE. THE STUDY INVOLVED 42 PLOTS INSIDE FIVE PSF LULCS – INTACT, LOGGED, BURNT (1997, 2015), REMNANT AND 212 PLOTS AT DISTANCES UP TO 2 KM FROM THE PSF EDGE IN THREE ACACIA PLANTATION LULCS – UNHARVESTED, HARVESTED, AND BURNT. THE NUMBER OF SPECIES PER PLOT WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN INTACT PSF (25 ± 6 (SD) PER 20 M × 10 M PLOT), LOGGED FOREST (30 ± 6) AND 1997 BURNT FOREST (30 ± 13) BUT LOWER IN 2015 BURNT FOREST (11 ± 10) AND REMNANT FOREST (18 ± 11). REGENERATION AWAY FROM THE PSF ACROSS ALL DEGRADED LULCS VARIED FROM FERN DOMINATED AREAS WITH NO REGENERATION TO CLUSTERS WITH HIGH STEM DENSITIES. THE PLANTATION LULCS, UNHARVESTED (94 SPECIES) AND HARVESTED ACACIA (71 SPECIES), HAD SIMILAR OVERALL SPECIES DIVERSITY AFTER 3–4 YEARS OF REGENERATION TO THE INTACT AND LOGGED PSF (90 SPECIES). IN UNHARVESTED ACACIA, TOTAL SPECIES DIVERSITY, SPECIES PER PLOT AND STEM DENSITY DECREASED WITH DISTANCE FROM FOREST EDGE (1–300 M – 87 SPECIES; 9 ± 6 (SD) SPECIES PER 20 M × 10 M PLOT; 1,056 STEMS/HA; 301–500 M – 33; 5 ± 2; 511 AND >500 M – 38; 6 ± 3; 683). IN HARVESTED ACACIA, THERE WAS LOW PLOT SPECIES DIVERSITY IRRESPECTIVE OF DISTANCE FROM THE FOREST (1–300 M – 51; 4 ± 2; 578; 301–500 M – 17; 4 ± 2; 1,100; >500 M – 48; 4 ± 2; 780). FACTORS WHICH MAY INFLUENCE REGENERATION DIFFERED BETWEEN DIFFERENT LULCS, BUT THERE WAS A CLEAR INFLUENCE OF DISTANCE FROM FOREST EDGE AND DISPERSAL MECHANISM – I.E. WHETHER A TREE WAS BIRD OR MAMMAL DISPERSED AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE TWO FACTORS. WHILE OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT IF NOT FURTHER DISTURBED BY LOGGING, DRAINAGE AND/OR FIRE, DEGRADED PSF COULD REGENERATE NATURALLY TO A SIMILAR SPECIES DIVERSITY AS INTACT PSF, THE LOWER LEVELS OF NATURAL REGENERATION FURTHER AWAY FROM THE FOREST MAY WARRANT SELECTIVE PLANTING OF SPECIES WHICH DO NOT DISPERSE OVER LONG DISTANCES.

APPL.,1,"URBAN AREAS ARE EXPANDING GLOBALLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HUMAN POPULATION INCREASES, WITH OVERALL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON BIODIVERSITY. TO PREVENT THE FURTHER LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY, IT IS URGENT TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS BEHIND THIS LOSS TO DEVELOP EVIDENCE-BASED SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS TO PRESERVE BIODIVERSITY IN URBAN LANDSCAPES. THE TWO EXTREME URBAN DEVELOPMENT TYPES ALONG A CONTINUUM, LAND-SPARING (LARGE, CONTINUOUS GREEN AREAS AND HIGH-DENSITY HOUSING) AND LAND-SHARING (SMALL, FRAGMENTED GREEN AREAS AND LOW-DENSITY HOUSING) HAVE BEEN THE RECENT FOCUS OF DEBATES REGARDING THE PATTERN OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, IN THIS CONTEXT, THERE IS NO INFORMATION ON THE MECHANISMS BEHIND THE OBSERVED BIODIVERSITY CHANGES. ONE OF THE MAIN MECHANISMS PROPOSED TO EXPLAIN URBAN BIODIVERSITY LOSS IS THE ALTERATION OF PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS. USING GROUND-NESTING BIRDS AS A MODEL SYSTEM AND DATA FROM NINE EUROPEAN CITIES, WE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED THE EFFECTS OF THESE TWO EXTREME URBAN DEVELOPMENT TYPES ON ARTIFICIAL GROUND NEST SURVIVAL AND WHETHER NEST SURVIVAL CORRELATES WITH THE LOCAL ABUNDANCE OF GROUND-NESTING BIRDS AND THEIR NEST PREDATORS. NEST SURVIVAL (N = 554) WAS LOWER IN LAND-SHARING THAN IN LAND-SPARING URBAN AREAS. NEST SURVIVAL DECREASED WITH INCREASING NUMBERS OF LOCAL PREDATORS (CATS AND CORVIDS) AND WITH NEST VISIBILITY. CORRESPONDINGLY, RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF GROUND-NESTING BIRDS WAS GREATER IN LAND-SPARING THAN IN LAND-SHARING URBAN AREAS, THOUGH OVERALL BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS WAS UNAFFECTED BY THE PATTERN OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT. WE PROVIDE THE FIRST EVIDENCE THAT PREDATOR–PREY INTERACTIONS DIFFER BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREME URBAN DEVELOPMENT TYPES. CHANGING INTERACTIONS MAY EXPLAIN THE HIGHER PROPORTION OF GROUND-NESTING BIRDS IN LAND-SPARING AREAS, AND SUGGEST A LIMITATION OF THE LAND-SHARING MODEL. NEST PREDATOR CONTROL AND THE PROVISION OF MORE GREEN-COVERED URBAN HABITATS MAY ALSO IMPROVE CONSERVATION OF SENSITIVE BIRDS IN CITIES. OUR FINDINGS PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HOW TO FURTHER EXPAND OUR CITIES WITHOUT SEVERE LOSS OF URBAN-SENSITIVE SPECIES AND GIVE SUPPORT FOR LAND-SPARING OVER LAND-SHARING URBAN DEVELOPMENT. © 2019 BY THE ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA",E02049,NA,ECAPE,"JOKIMÄKI, J.; NATURE INVENTORY AND EIA-SERVICES, P.

APPROACHES USED TO ASSESS ATTITUDES RARELY ACCOUNT FOR BIAS ARISING FROM REPORTING ERROR, WHICH CAN LEAD TO FALSELY REPORTING A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD CONSERVATION (FALSE-POSITIVE ERROR) OR NOT REPORTING A POSITIVE ATTITUDE WHEN THE RESPONDENT HAS A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD CONSERVATION (FALSE-NEGATIVE ERROR). BORROWING FROM DEVELOPMENTS IN APPLIED CONSERVATION SCIENCE, WE USED A BAYESIAN HIERARCHICAL MODEL TO QUANTIFY STAKEHOLDER ATTITUDES AS THE PROBABILITY OF HAVING A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD WILDLIFE NOTIONALLY (OR IN ABSTRACT TERMS) AND AT LOCALIZED SCALES WHILE ACCOUNTING FOR REPORTING ERROR. WE COMPARED ESTIMATES FROM OUR MODEL, LIKERT SCORES, AND NAÏVE ESTIMATES (I.E., PROPORTION OF RESPONDENTS REPORTING A POSITIVE ATTITUDE IN AT LEAST 1 QUESTION THAT WAS ONLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO FALSE-NEGATIVE ERROR) WITH TRUE STAKEHOLDER ATTITUDES THROUGH SIMULATIONS. WE THEN APPLIED THE MODEL IN A SURVEY OF TEA ESTATE STAFF ON THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARD ASIAN ELEPHANTS (ELEPHAS MAXIMUS) IN THE KAZIRANGA–KARBI ANGLONG LANDSCAPE OF NORTHEAST INDIA. IN SIMULATIONS, BAYESIAN MODEL ESTIMATES OF STAKEHOLDER ATTITUDES TOWARD WILDLIFE WERE LESS BIASED THAN NAÏVE ESTIMATES OR LIKERT SCORES. AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR REPORTING ERRORS, WE ESTIMATED THE PROBABILITY OF HAVING A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD ELEPHANTS NOTIONALLY AS 0.85 IN THE KAZIRANGA LANDSCAPE, WHEREAS THE PROPORTION OF RESPONDENTS WHO HAD POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD ELEPHANTS AT A LOCALIZED SCALE WAS 0.50. IN COMPARISON, WITHOUT ACCOUNTING FOR REPORTING ERRORS, NAÏVE ESTIMATES OF PROPORTIONS OF RESPONDENTS WITH POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD ELEPHANTS WERE 0.69 AND 0.23 NOTIONALLY AND AT LOCAL SCALES, RESPECTIVELY. FALSE (POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE) REPORTING PROBABILITIES WERE CONSISTENTLY NOT 0 (0.22–0.68).

WHILE THE EXTINCTION OF THE TOP CONSUMERS PROBABLY EXPANDED THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO SURVIVORS OF ALL BODY SIZES, LITTLE WORK HAS FOCUSED ON THE RESPONSES OF THE SMALLEST MAMMALS. HERE, WE USE A DETAILED FOSSIL RECORD FROM THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES TO EXAMINE THE RESPONSE OF THE HISPID COTTON RAT SIGMODON HISPIDUS TO BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND CLIMATIC CHANGE OVER THE LATE QUATERNARY. IN PARTICULAR, WE FOCUS ON CHANGES IN DIET AND BODY SIZE. WE CHARACTERIZE DIET THROUGH CARBON (Δ13C) AND NITROGEN (Δ15N) ISOTOPE ANALYSIS OF BONE COLLAGEN IN FOSSIL JAWS AND BODY SIZE THROUGH MEASUREMENT OF FOSSIL TEETH; THE ABUNDANCE OF MATERIAL ALLOWS US TO EXAMINE POPULATION LEVEL RESPONSES AT MILLENNIAL SCALE FOR THE PAST 16 KA. SIGMODON WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE CAVE DURING THE FULL GLACIAL, FIRST APPEARING AT ~16 KA AFTER ICE SHEETS WERE IN RETREAT. IT REMAINED RELATIVELY RARE UNTIL ~12 KA WHEN WARMING TEMPERATURES ALLOWED IT TO EXPAND ITS SPECIES RANGE NORTHWARD. WE FIND VARIATION IN BOTH DIET AND BODY SIZE OF SIGMODON HISPIDUS OVER TIME: THE AVERAGE BODY SIZE OF THE POPULATION VARIED BY ~20% (90–110 G) AND MEAN Δ13C AND Δ15N VALUES RANGED BETWEEN −13.5 TO −16.5‰ AND 5.5 TO 7.4‰ RESPECTIVELY. A STATE–SPACE MODEL SUGGESTED CHANGES IN MASS WERE INFLUENCED BY DIET, MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, WHILE THE MODEST CHANGES IN DIET WERE MOST INFLUENCED BY COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. SIGMODON MAINTAINED A FAIRLY SIMILAR DIETARY NICHE OVER TIME DESPITE CONTEMPORANEOUS CHANGES IN CLIMATE AND HERBIVORE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION THAT FOLLOWED THE MEGAFAUNA EXTINCTION.

THEORY SUGGESTS THAT A LARGER BRAIN SHOULD PROVIDE HIGHER TOLERANCE TO URBANIZATION BY ENHANCING BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY TO COPE WITH NOVEL CHALLENGES. HOWEVER, ASSEMBLING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR A LINK BETWEEN BRAIN SIZE AND TOLERANCE TO URBANIZATION HAS PROVEN TO BE DIFFICULT, PERHAPS BECAUSE THE EFFECT OF THE BRAIN INTERACTS WITH LIFE HISTORY TO INFLUENCE PERSISTENCE IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS. HERE, WE PROVIDE A GLOBAL-SCALE ASSESSMENT OF THE ROLE OF BRAIN SIZE ON URBAN TOLERANCE, COMBINING QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATIONS OF URBAN TOLERANCE WITH DETAILED INFORMATION ON BRAIN SIZE, LIFE HISTORY AND ECOLOGY FOR 629 AVIAN SPECIES ACROSS 27 CITIES. OUR ANALYSIS CONFIRMS THE EXPECTED POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BRAIN SIZE AND URBAN TOLERANCE, BUT SHOWS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS MORE COMPLEX THAN PREVIOUSLY SHOWN. WHILE A LARGE RELATIVE BRAIN SIZE GENERALLY INCREASES URBAN TOLERANCE, SPECIES WITH SMALL BRAINS CAN STILL ATTAIN HIGH SUCCESS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS IF THEY SPREAD THE RISK OF REPRODUCTION ACROSS MULTIPLE EVENTS (I.E., HAVE A LOW BROOD VALUE).

USING A CONTINENTAL-SCALE ANALYSIS OF 1657 NORTH AMERICAN BREEDING-BIRD COMMUNITIES SPANNING 20-YEARS AND 35 ECOREGIONS, WE SHOW LOCAL SPECIES DIVERSITY AND Β-DIVERSITY INFLUENCE TWO COMPONENTS OF REGIONAL STABILITY: LOCAL STABILITY (STABILITY OF BIRD BIOMASS WITHIN SITES) AND SPATIAL ASYNCHRONY (ASYNCHRONOUS FLUCTUATIONS IN BIOMASS AMONG SITES). WE FOUND SPATIAL ASYNCHRONY EXPLAINED THREE TIMES MORE VARIATION IN REGIONAL STABILITY OF BIRD BIOMASS THAN DID LOCAL STABILITY.

DESPITE MANY STUDIES THAT HAVE COMPARED BIRD DIVERSITY BETWEEN NATURAL AND PRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS, A GLOBAL SYNTHESIS IS STILL MISSING AND IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW BIODIVERSITY IS BEING ALTERED. WE CONDUCTED A META-ANALYSIS BASED ON 144 CASE STUDIES TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF FOUR TYPES OF PLANTATIONS (FORESTRY, OIL PALM, COFFEE, AND CACAO) ON BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE. WE EXAMINED THOSE EFFECTS IN FUNCTION OF PLANTATION TYPE, LATITUDINAL ZONE (TEMPERATE OR TROPICAL), GEOGRAPHICAL CONTEXT (MAINLAND OR ISLAND), ZOOGEOGRAPHIC ZONE, AND BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS. PLANTATIONS PRESENTED NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON BOTH BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE. OIL PALM PLANTATIONS SHOWED MORE NEGATIVE EFFECTS FOLLOWED BY FORESTRY PLANTATIONS, WHEREAS COFFEE AND CACAO AGROFORESTRY PLANTATIONS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS. THOSE EFFECTS WERE GEOGRAPHICALLY VARIABLE, BEING MORE PRONOUNCED IN ISLANDS AND TEMPERATE ZONES, AS WELL AS AT THE ORIENTAL, PALEARCTIC, AND NEOTROPICAL ZOOGEOGRAGHIC REGIONS, AND AT THE SUNDALAND AND MEDITERRANEAN BASIN BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS.

IN LIGHT OF THE LARGE ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT THAT MINING WOULD LEAVE AND GIVEN THE DIVERSITY AND THE VULNERABILITY OF THE ABYSSAL FAUNA, THE INTERNATIONAL SEABED AUTHORITY HAS IMPLEMENTED A REGIONAL MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT INCLUDES THE CREATION OF NINE AREAS OF PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEREST (APEIS) LOCATED AT THE PERIPHERY OF THE CCFZ. THE SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES FOR THE DESIGN OF THE APEIS WERE BASED ON THE BEST - ALBEIT VERY LIMITED - KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA. THE FAUNA AND HABITATS IN THE APEIS ARE UNKNOWN, AS ARE SPECIES RANGES AND THE EXTENT OF BIODIVERSITY ACROSS THE CCFZ. AS PART OF THE JOINT PROGRAMMING INITIATIVE HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE SEAS AND OCEANS (JPI OCEANS) PILOT ACTION ""ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF DEEP-SEA MINING"", THE SO239 CRUISE PROVIDED DATA TO IMPROVE SPECIES INVENTORIES, DETERMINE SPECIES RANGES, IDENTIFY THE DRIVERS OF BETA DIVERSITY PATTERNS AND ASSESS THE REPRESENTATIVENESS OF AN APEI. FOUR EXPLORATION CONTRACT AREAS AND AN APEI (APEI NO. 3) WERE SAMPLED ALONG A GRADIENT OF SEA SURFACE PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY THAT SPANNED A DISTANCE OF 1440 KM IN THE EASTERN CCFZ. BETWEEN THREE AND EIGHT QUANTITATIVE BOX CORES (0.25M2; 0-10 CM) WERE SAMPLED IN EACH STUDY AREA, RESULTING IN A LARGE COLLECTION OF POLYCHAETES THAT WERE MORPHOLOGICALLY AND MOLECULARLY (CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE SUBUNIT I AND 16S GENES) ANALYZED. A TOTAL OF 275 POLYCHAETE MORPHOSPECIES WERE IDENTIFIED. ONLY ONE MORPHOSPECIES WAS SHARED AMONG ALL FIVE STUDY AREAS AND 49% WERE SINGLETONS. THE PATTERNS IN COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION WERE MAINLY ATTRIBUTED TO VARIATIONS IN ORGANIC CARBON FLUXES TO THE SEAFLOOR AT THE REGIONAL SCALE AND NODULE DENSITY AT THE LOCAL SCALE, THUS SUPPORTING THE MAIN ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE DESIGN OF THE APEIS. HOWEVER, THE APEI NO. 3, WHICH IS LOCATED IN AN OLIGOTROPHIC PROVINCE AND SEPARATED FROM THE CCFZ BY THE CLARION FRACTURE ZONE, SHOWED THE LOWEST DENSITIES, LOWEST DIVERSITY, AND A VERY LOW AND DISTANT INDEPENDENT SIMILARITY IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION COMPARED TO THE CONTRACT AREAS, THUS QUESTIONING THE REPRESENTATIVENESS AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF APEI NO. 3 TO MEET ITS PURPOSE OF DIVERSITY PRESERVATION. AMONG THE FOUR EXPLORATION CONTRACTS, WHICH BELONG TO A MESOTROPHIC PROVINCE, THE DISTANCE DECAY OF SIMILARITY PROVIDED A SPECIES TURNOVER OF 0.04 SPECIES KM-1, AN AVERAGE SPECIES RANGE OF 25 KM AND AN EXTRAPOLATED RICHNESS OF UP TO 240 000 POLYCHAETE SPECIES IN THE CCFZ. BY CONTRAST, NONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATORS OF DIVERSITY PREDICT A REGIONAL RICHNESS OF UP TO 498 SPECIES. BOTH ESTIMATES ARE BIASED BY THE HIGH FREQUENCY OF SINGLETONS IN THE DATASET, WHICH LIKELY RESULT FROM UNDERSAMPLING AND MERELY REFLECT OUR LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY.

FACED WITH UNCERTAINTY, MANY DECISION MAKERS AND EVEN SCIENTISTS ARE STILL RELUCTANT TO PRESCRIBE FIRE FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES IN FIRE-PRONE ECOSYSTEMS, INVOKING THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE. KNOWLEDGE GAPS ON THE IDEAL FIRE REGIME, SUCH AS HOW AND WHEN TO BURN, AND ESPECIALLY THE FEAR OF BIODIVERSITY LOSSES, ARE AMONG THE MAIN ARGUMENTS AGAINST FIRE MANAGEMENT APPLIED TO REMNANTS OF NATIVE SAVANNA VEGETATION. TO INFORM THIS DEBATE, WE ASSESSED THE IMPACT OF PRESCRIBED FIRES ON DIVERSITY OF PLANTS (DIFFERENT GROWTH FORMS), ANTS, FROGS, LIZARDS, BIRDS, AND SMALL MAMMALS, IN SAVANNAS AND GRASSLANDS OF THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO. WE ASSESSED THE EXISTING SPECIES RICHNESS, COMPOSITION, AND ABUNDANCE IN AREAS SUBJECTED TO LONG PERIODS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION AND COMPARED TO THAT OBSERVED OVER A SHORT PERIOD AFTER PRESCRIBED DRY-SEASON FIRES, WITHIN EACH GROUP OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS. WHENEVER POSSIBLE, WE CARRIED OUT SEPARATE ANALYSES FOR GRASSLAND AND SAVANNA. BURNING DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE SPECIES RICHNESS OF ANY OF THE GROUPS ANALYZED, BUT HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON RICHNESS OF GRAMINOIDS IN GRASSLAND. WHEN ANALYZED AT THE SPECIES LEVEL, ABUNDANCE OF MOST ANIMAL GROUPS DID NOT SHOW CONSISTENT RESPONSES TO FIRE, EXCEPT FOR A DECREASE IN SOME FROG POPULATIONS IN GRASSLANDS. FORBS, GRAMINOIDS, AND SUBSHRUBS INCREASED IN ABUNDANCE AFTER FIRE IN GRASSLAND AREAS, THOUGH IN SAVANNA AREAS, ABUNDANCE OF FORBS, AND SUBSHRUBS TENDED TO DECLINE AFTER FIRE. SPECIES COMPOSITION CHANGED LITTLE IN RESPONSE TO FIRE AS INDICATED BY LOW LEVELS OF DISSIMILARITY BETWEEN BURNED AND UNBURNED AREAS. THESE RESULTS CONFIRM THE HIGH RESILIENCE OF CERRADO BIOTA TO FIRE, AS EXPECTED FOR SAVANNA ECOSYSTEMS IN GENERAL.

AND MATRIX TYPE (CATTLE PASTURE). WE EVALUATED THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF 9 PREDICTOR VARIABLES, INCLUDING PATCH SIZE, DISTANCE FROM EDGE, AND SELECTIVE ASPECTS OF VEGETATION STRUCTURE ON THE COMPOSITION, SIZE, SPECIES RICHNESS, FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY, AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY OF FLOCKS. WE FOUND EFFECTS OF BOTH PATCH SIZE AND VEGETATION STRUCTURE ON FLOCK SPECIES RICHNESS, SIZE, AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY, BUT NO SUPPORT FOR EDGE EFFECTS. GENERALLY, FLOCK RICHNESS AND SIZE RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO FRAGMENTATION THAN DID FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY METRICS. BOTH FLOCK SIZE AND RICHNESS INCREASED WITH PATCH SIZE, BUT THIS VARIABLE HAD NO EFFECT ON FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY. FLOCK RICHNESS AND SIZE INCREASED IN HIGH-CANOPY FORESTS WITH GREATER FOLIAGE HEIGHT DIVERSITY, WHEREAS UNLOGGED, OLD-GROWTH PRIMARY FORESTS WITH LARGE-DIAMETER TREES HAD LOWER FLOCK RICHNESS AND SIZE, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY. PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY WAS NOT AFFECTED BY PATCH SIZE, EDGE EFFECTS, OR VEGETATION STRUCTURE. WE FOUND DIFFERENCES IN FLOCK COMPOSITION IN RESPONSE TO FRAGMENTATION.

BREWSTER S,NA,NA,NA,PERFORM. RES.,1,"THIS ESSAY EXPLORES THE WORK REMEMBRANCE DAY FOR LOST SPECIES (RDLS), A COALITION OF ARTISTS, ACTIVISTS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO MEMORIALISE THE LOSSES OF EXTINCTION. I ARGUE THAT RDLS'S PRACTICES CREATE AN ETHICS OF WITNESSING ECOLOGICAL LOSS IN WAYS THAT EXPAND DISCOURSES ABOUT WHAT (AND WHO) COUNTS AS GRIEVABLE LIFE. I TAKE UP JUDITH BUTLER'S THEORISATION OF THE POWERS OF MOURNING IN RENDERING LIFE LEGIBLE TO ILLUMINATE THE WAYS RDLS MOBILISES GRIEF AND ABSENCE, THUS REIMAGINING RELATIONS BETWEEN HUMANS AND NONHUMANS IN A SPACE OUTSIDE OF CAPITAL. RDLS PARTICIPANTS UNITE ON 30 NOVEMBER TO BEAR WITNESS TO THE EXTINCTION OF SPECIES, HABITATS AND CULTURES. THE MOVEMENT WAS FOUNDED IN 2011 BY UK-BASED PERFORMANCE COLLECTIVE FERAL THEATRE, ARTIST ANDREAS KORNEVALL AND REVEREND PETER OWEN JONES. SEVERAL OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND ARTISTS HAVE SINCE JOINED, THOUGH ANYONE MAY CREATE PARTICIPATE, ADDING THEIR EVENTS TO THE RDLS CROWD-SOURCED ELECTRONIC ARCHIVE. I LOOK AT A PARTICULAR EVENT, THE LAKE MERRITT REGENERATIVE MEMORIAL AND POLLINATOR PROCESSION (2017), TO ARTICULATE THE PERFORMANCE PRACTICES BROUGHT TOGETHER UNDER RDLS AS A PRAXIS OF ETHICAL WITNESSING IN THE TIME OF CLIMATE CRISES. RDLS RENDERS NONHUMANS AS SUBJECTS THROUGH THE CREATION OF MOURNING RITUALS FOR EXTINCT AND ENDANGERED SPECIES. BY APPROACHING NONHUMANS THROUGH WHAT BUTLER HAS CALLED GRIEVABILITY, RDLS COUNTERS THE HUMAN EXCEPTIONALISM THAT SUPPORTS THE EXPLOITATION OF NATURE AS MERELY RAW MATERIAL FOR ENDLESS ACCUMULATION. BY CHALLENGING THIS LOGIC OF ACCUMULATION, RDLS PARTICIPATES IN A QUEERING OF NORMATIVE CAPITALIST TIME THROUGH THE CREATION OF A TIME-SPACE OUTSIDE OF THE INEXORABLE FORWARD MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL. AS THEY ENGAGE IN ‘NONPRODUCTIVE’ USES OF TIME, RDLS RESISTS THE VAST UNMARKED (BIODIVERSITY) LOSS INTRINSIC TO GLOBAL CAPITALISM, BRINGING FORTH NEW FORMS OF HUMAN AND NONHUMAN RELATIONALITY IN THE FACE OF ECOLOGICAL BREAKDOWN. © 2020, © 2020 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP.",NA,NA,NA,"BREWSTER, S.",ARTICLE,10.1080/13528165.2020.1752582,NA,13528165,PERFORMANCE RESEARCH,ENGLISH,NA,NA,0,2,95-101,ROUTLEDGE,NA,SCOPUS,REMEMBRANCE DAY FOR LOST SPECIES: TOWARD AN ETHICS OF WITNESSING EXTINCTION,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086148199&doi=10.1080%2f13528165.2020.1752582&partnerID=40&md5=8c7d63f642228321224090f911a40141,25,2020,NA NA NA,PERFORM RES,none,NA,NOTREPORTED,NA,"BREWSTER S, 2020, PERFORM RES","BREWSTER S, 2020, PERFORM RES"

WE ADDRESSED THE FIRST ISSUE BY ASSESSING THE COMPARISON BETWEEN CONSERVATION STATUS AND HABITAT SUITABILITY UNDER DIFFERING CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS FOR SIXTEEN SPECIES OF FIVE AMPHIBIAN FAMILIES (PELOBATIDAE, BUFONIDAE, ALYTIDAE, HYLIDAE AND RANIDAE) DISTRIBUTED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE GIBRALTAR STRAIT, WITH THE AIM OF VERIFY WHETHER POTENTIALLY SENSIBLE SPECIES UNDER CLIMATIC CHANGE SCENARIOS ARE OR NOT CONSIDERED AT RISK PRESENTLY IN THE IUCN CURRENT CATEGORIES. WE HAVE ADDRESSED THIS WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL NICHE MODELLING ALGORITHM (MAXENT) AND PROJECTING THE OUTPUTS IN FOUR FUTURE CLIMATIC CHANGE SCENARIOS. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT CLIMATIC NICHES OF SOME SPECIES MAY CURRENTLY MATCH THEIR CONSERVATION CATEGORY, WITH PELOBATES VARALDII HAVING THE NARROWEST DISTRIBUTION AND BEING THE MORE ENDANGERED SPECIES, BUT NOT ALL RESPONSES TO PREDICTED CLIMATIC CHANGE SCENARIOS ARE RELATED TO CONSERVATION STATUS. SOME SUGGEST NOTABLE CHANGES IN POTENTIAL CLIMATIC HABITATS, WITH BOTH SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE (7 SPECIES) AND DECREASE (5 SPECIES) REPRESENTED. THREATENED SPECIES SUCH AS P. VARALDII COULD BE CLIMATICALLY FAVORED WHEREAS CURRENTLY MORE ABUNDANT SPECIES COULD MAINTAIN, INCREASE, OR REDUCE THEIR HABITAT DISTRIBUTION.

TO HELP ENSURE FOOD SECURITY IN THE FUTURE, AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS WILL HAVE TO RESPOND TO GLOBAL CHANGE DRIVERS SUCH AS POPULATION GROWTH, CHANGING DIETARY HABITS, AND CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER, ALTERATIONS OF HOW FOOD IS PRODUCED IN THE FUTURE MAY CONFLICT WITH OTHER UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS), SUCH AS THE PROTECTION OF LAND RESOURCES AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION. IT IS CRUCIAL FOR DECISION-MAKERS TO UNDERSTAND POTENTIAL TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN THESE GOALS TO FIND A BALANCE OF HUMAN NEEDS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. IN THIS PAPER, WE ANALYZE PATHWAYS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY, LAND USE, AND LAND-COVER CHANGES IN INDIA UNTIL 2030 AND THEIR IMPACTS ON TERRESTRIAL BIODIVERSITY AND CARBON STORAGE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT IN ORDER TO MEET FUTURE FOOD PRODUCTION DEMANDS, AGRICULTURAL LANDS ARE LIKELY TO EXPAND, AND EXISTING FARMLANDS NEED TO BE INTENSIFIED. HOWEVER, BOTH PROCESSES WILL RESULT IN BIODIVERSITY LOSSES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE PROJECTIONS REVEAL CARBON STOCK INCREASES DUE TO INTENSIFICATION PROCESSES AND DECREASES DUE TO CONVERSIONS OF NATURAL LAND INTO AGRICULTURE. ON BALANCE, WE FIND THAT CARBON STOCKS INCREASE WITH THE SCENARIOS OF FUTURE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AS MODELED HERE. IN CONCLUSION, WE REGARD FURTHER AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AS A CRUCIAL ELEMENT TO HELP ENSURE FOOD SECURITY AND TO SLOW DOWN THE EXPANSION OF CROPLAND AND PASTURE.

HERE, WE USED A DATA SET OF NORTH AMERICAN (PALEOTROPICAL) FOSSIL OCCURRENCES OF BRACHIOPOD, BIVALVE, AND CORAL GENERA FROM THE PALEOBIOLOGY DATABASE, COMBINED WITH LITHOLOGIC DATA FROM MACROSTRAT, TO DEMONSTRATE THAT LOW DIVERSITY WAS CAUSED BY THE COLLAPSE OF CARBONATE ENVIRONMENTS DURING THE LPIA. AFTER DIVIDING THE DATA BY LITHOLOGY, LOW DIVERSITY WAS EVIDENT ONLY IN CARBONATE ENVIRONMENTS, WHEREAS DIVERSITY WITHIN SILICICLASTIC ENVIRONMENTS ACTUALLY INCREASED DURING THE LPIA, AFTER A BRIEF DECLINE IN THE SERPUKHOVIAN (LATE MISSISSIPPIAN). DIVERSITY PATTERNS CLOSELY MATCHED RESPECTIVE CHANGES IN THE VOLUME OF CARBONATE AND SILICICLASTIC ROCKS. THE CONTRASTING PATTERNS OBSERVED IN THE TWO ENVIRONMENTS SUGGEST THAT HABITAT LOSS WAS A DIRECT CAUSE OF CHANGES IN DIVERSITY, BECAUSE OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS TEMPERATURE, WOULD HAVE AFFECTED GENERA IN BOTH ENVIRONMENTS. A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE FINDING THAT DIVERSITY REMAINED HIGH IN CARBONATE REFUGIA (CARBONATE BEDS WITHIN MAJORITY-SILICICLASTIC FORMATIONS) UNTIL THE BASHKIRIAN, POSTDATING THE ONSET OF ICEHOUSE CONDITIONS BY ∼8 M.Y.

WITH AN EFFORT OF 4,797 KM IN 725 KM2 OF WESTERN GIR PROTECTED AREA, INDIA, WE USED POLYGON SEARCH BASED SPATIALLY EXPLICIT CAPTURE RECAPTURE FRAMEWORK TO ESTIMATE LION DENSITY. USING VIBRISSAE PATTERNS AND PERMANENT BODY MARKS WE IDENTIFIED 67 LIONS FROM 368 LION SIGHTINGS. WE CONDUCTED DISTANCE SAMPLING ON 35 TRANSECTS WITH AN EFFORT OF 101.5 KM TO ESTIMATE SPATIAL PREY DENSITY USING GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODELING (GAM). SUBSEQUENTLY, WE MODELED LION SPATIAL DENSITY WITH PREY, HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS, ANTHROPOGENIC FACTORS AND DISTANCE TO BAITING SITES. LION DENSITY (&GT;1-YEAR-OLD LIONS) WAS ESTIMATED AT 8.53 (SE 1.05) /100 KM2 WITH LIONESSES HAVING SMALLER MOVEMENT PARAMETER (Σ = 2.55 KM; SE 0.12) COMPARED TO MALES (Σ = 5.32 KM; SE 0.33).

SPATIAL LION DENSITY WAS BEST EXPLAINED BY PROXIMITY TO BAITING SITES AND FLAT VALLEY HABITAT BUT NOT AS MUCH BY PREY DENSITY. WE DEMONSTRATE A SCIENTIFICALLY ROBUST APPROACH TO ESTIMATE LION ABUNDANCE, THAT DUE TO ITS SPATIAL CONTEXT, CAN BE USEFUL FOR MANAGEMENT OF HABITAT AND HUMAN-LION INTERFACE. WE RECOMMEND THIS METHOD FOR LION POPULATION ASSESSMENT ACROSS THEIR RANGE. HIGH LION DENSITIES IN WESTERN GIR WERE CORRELATED WITH BAITING. THE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE OF ATTRACTING LIONS FOR TOURISM CAN PERTURB NATURAL LION DENSITIES, DISRUPT BEHAVIOR, LION SOCIAL DYNAMICS AND HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON LOCAL PREY DENSITIES. © 2020 GOGOI ET AL.

TO ADDRESS THESE SHORTCOMINGS AND ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF BIOGEOGRAPHY AND FISH PRESENCE ON THE CRITICAL ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION OF MACROALGAL REMOVAL, WE USED ASSAYS OF SIX ALGAL GENERA ACROSS THREE REEF HABITATS IN TWO BIOGEOGRAPHICALLY DISTINCT LOCATIONS: LITTLE CAYMAN IN THE CARIBBEAN AND LIZARD ISLAND ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF (GBR). PATTERNS OF FISH FEEDING AND REALISED ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION WERE STRIKINGLY SIMILAR BETWEEN THE TWO GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, DESPITE A THREEFOLD DIFFERENCE IN THE LOCAL DIVERSITY OF NOMINALLY HERBIVOROUS FISHES, A 2.4-FOLD DIFFERENCE IN THE DIVERSITY OF FISHES FEEDING AND DIFFERENCES IN THE BIOGEOGRAPHIC HISTORY OF THE TWO LOCATIONS.

IN PARTICULAR, TROPICAL FOREST REGENERATION DEPENDS ON ANIMAL-MEDIATED SEED DISPERSAL, BUT THE SEED-DISPERSING ANIMALS FACE RAPID DECLINE DUE TO FOREST FRAGMENTATION AND DEFAUNATION. HERE, WE ASSESS HOW FRAGMENTATION INFLUENCES THE PAIRWISE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN 407 SEED DISPERSER AND 1,424 TREE SPECIES IN A HIGHLY FRAGMENTED BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT. LOCATION: ATLANTIC FOREST, SOUTH AMERICA. METHODS: WE PREDICTED INTERACTION NETWORKS IN 912 SITES COVERING THE ENTIRE BIOME BY COMBINING VERIFIED INTERACTION DATA WITH CO-OCCURRENCE PROBABILITIES OBTAINED FROM A SPATIALLY EXPLICIT JOINT SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODEL. WE IDENTIFIED KEYSTONE SEED DISPERSERS BY COMPUTING A SPECIES-SPECIFIC KEYSTONE INDEX AND BY SELECTING THOSE SPECIES BELONGING TO THE TOP 5% QUANTILE. RESULTS: WE SHOW THAT FOREST FRAGMENTATION AFFECTS SEED DISPERSAL INTERACTIONS NEGATIVELY, AND THE DECREASED AREA OF FUNCTIONALLY CONNECTED FOREST, RATHER THAN INCREASED EDGE EFFECTS, IS THE MAIN DRIVER BEHIND THE LOSS OF INTERACTIONS. BOTH THE SEED DISPERSER AVAILABILITY FOR THE LOCAL TREE COMMUNITIES AND IN PARTICULAR THE PROPORTION OF INTERACTIONS PROVIDED BY KEYSTONE SEED DISPERSERS DECLINE WITH INCREASING DEGREE OF FRAGMENTATION. IMPORTANTLY, JUST 21 KEYSTONE SPECIES PROVIDED >40% OF ALL INTERACTIONS. THE NUMBERS OF INTERACTIONS PROVIDED BY KEYSTONE AND NON-KEYSTONE SPECIES, HOWEVER, WERE EQUALLY NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY FRAGMENTATION, SUGGESTING THAT SEED DISPERSAL INTERACTIONS MAY NOT BE REWIRED UNDER STRONG FRAGMENTATION EFFECTS. CONCLUSIONS: WE HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE FRAGMENTATION-INDUCED COMPOSITIONAL SHIFTS IN SEED DISPERSER COMMUNITIES AS THEY MAY LEAD TO LAGGED AND MULTIPLICATIVE EFFECTS ON TREE COMMUNITIES. OUR RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THE UTILITY OF MODEL-BASED PREDICTION OF INTERACTION NETWORKS AS WELL AS MODEL-BASED IDENTIFICATION OF KEYSTONE SPECIES AS A TOOL FOR PRIORITIZING CONSERVATION EFFORTS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE TOXICITY OF A RIVER HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY URBAN EFFLUENTS (ATUBA RIVER, CURITIBA CITY, SOUTHERN BRAZIL) TO THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT IN FOUR SOUTH AMERICAN NATIVE FISH SPECIES, INVESTIGATING THE CONSEQUENCES AT THE POPULATION LEVEL THROUGH MATHEMATICAL MODELLING. THE SPECIES CHOSEN WERE SALMINUS BRASILIENSIS, PROCHILODUS LINEATUS, RHAMDIA QUELEN, AND PSEUDOPLATYSTOMA CORRUSCANS, ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT SPECIES ENCOMPASSING DIFFERENT CONSERVATION STATUSES AND VULNERABILITY. THE EMBRYOS WERE EXPOSED FROM 8 TO 96 H POST FERTILIZATION TO THE ATUBA RIVER WATER, COLLECTED DOWNSTREAM OF THE LARGEST WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT IN THE METROPOLITAN REGION OF CURITIBA, AND THEIR SURVIVAL RATES AND DEFORMITIES WERE REGISTERED. THE SPECIES S. BRASILIENSIS AND P. LINEATUS PRESENTED THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATES, SHOWING HIGH SENSITIVITY TO THE POLLUTANTS PRESENT IN THE WATER. ACCORDING TO THE INDIVIDUAL-BASED MATHEMATICAL MODEL, THESE SPECIES SHOWED HIGH VULNERABILITY AND RISK OF EXTINCTION UNDER THE TESTED EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS, EVEN WHEN DIFFERENT SENSITIVITY SCENARIOS OF JUVENILES AND ADULTS WERE CONSIDERED. THE OTHER TWO SPECIES, R. QUELEN AND P. CORRUSCANS, SHOWED A MORE RESISTANT CONDITION TO MORTALITY, BUT ALSO PRESENTED HIGH FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF DEFORMITIES. THESE RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTING THE SENSITIVITY OF DIFFERENT BRAZILIAN NATIVE SPECIES FOR THE CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY AND THE APPLICATION OF MODELS TO PREDICT THE EFFECTS OF POLLUTANTS AT THE POPULATION LEVEL. © 2019 ELSEVIER INC.",109907,WASTE WATER,EESAD,"OLIVEIRA RIBEIRO, C.A.D.; LABORATÓRIO DE TOXICOLOGIA CELULAR, CEP, BRAZIL; EMAIL: CIRO@UFPR.BR",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109907,"PALO ALTO HEALTH SCIENCESPALO ALTO HEALTH SCIENCES, PAHS COORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIORCOORDENAÇÃO DE APERFEIÇOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NÍVEL SUPERIOR, CAPES",1476513,ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,8,NA,NA,ACADEMIC PRESS,31732269,SCOPUS,URBAN EFFLUENTS AFFECT THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGES OF BRAZILIAN FISH SPECIES WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR POPULATION DYNAMICS,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075447157&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2019.109907&partnerID=40&md5=bfa7b3b2a7d7b0b46b9bd9c7f96a9da3,188,2020,THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO THANK AMANDA CAMARA DE SOUZA FOR THE ASSISTANCE DURING THE LABORATORY PROCEDURES AND INSTRUMENTAL ANALYSIS OF POPS AND PAHS AND THE BRAZILIAN AGENCY COORDINATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION PERSONNEL ( CAPES ) FOR THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT.

EVID.,1,"BACKGROUND: BIODIVERSITY LOSS, PARTLY DUE TO INTENSIFICATION OF AGRICULTURE, HAS BECOME A GLOBAL ISSUE. IN THIS CONTEXT, FRUIT PRODUCERS HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR NATURE-FRIENDLY PRODUCTION METHODS. BY REDUCING INTENSIVE PESTICIDE USE AND ENHANCING ORCHARD MANAGEMENT, THEY AIM TO CREATE HABITATS SUITABLE FOR BENEFICIAL ORGANISMS. FRUIT PRODUCTION, ESPECIALLY IN LOW-STEM ORCHARDS, REQUIRES SEVERAL INTERVENTIONS (PLANT PROTECTION, TILLAGE, GREENWORK) THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, EACH OF THEM REPRESENTING A DISTURBANCE. THUS, AN EXPERT SYSTEM THAT EVALUATES AND AGGREGATES THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL FARMING ACTIVITIES ON A SET OF BIODIVERSITY INDICATORS WOULD BE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR DEVELOPING NEW, LESS BIODIVERSITY-DAMAGING SCENARIOS. THIS EXPERT SYSTEM SHOULD BE BASED ON EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. SURPRISINGLY, OUR LITERATURE SEARCHES SUGGESTED THAT INTERNATIONAL JOURNALS CONTAIN FEW PUBLICATIONS ON THE IMPACT OF MOST PRACTICES (EXCEPT PESTICIDE USE) IN ORCHARDS ON BIODIVERSITY IN GENERAL AND BENEFICIAL ORGANISMS IN PARTICULAR. HOWEVER, IN THE LAST DECADE, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PUBLISHED ARTICLES HAVE POINTED OUT THE RISING IMPORTANCE OF BIODIVERSITY IN LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT. WE THEREFORE COMPILED AND STRUCTURED THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE TO (1) ASSESS THE STATE OF RESEARCH ON DISCRETE BIODIVERSITY INDICATORS AND AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES, (2) IDENTIFY THE LITERATURE RELEVANT FOR ASSESSING PRODUCTION IMPACT AND HABITAT SUITABILITY FOR SUPPORTING BIODIVERSITY AND (3) PROVIDE A WIDE-RANGING OVERVIEW OF EXISTING EVIDENCE OF THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES IN FRUIT ORCHARDS ON BIODIVERSITY. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, AGRONOMY MAGAZINES AND ACROSS THE INTERNET IN ENGLISH, GERMAN AND FRENCH. THE MAIN REVIEWER FOLLOWED A STEP-BY-STEP ELIGIBILITY SCHEME THAT WAS VALIDATED BY A KAPPA TEST BETWEEN TWO REVIEWERS. ADDITIONALLY, A THIRD REVIEWER CHECKED A SUBSET OF ARTICLES. WE MAPPED A LARGE RANGE OF PARAMETERS, WHICH WERE STRUCTURED IN CODE SETS. TO COMPUTE A STUDY VALIDITY ASSESSMENT, WE USED 13 PARAMETERS THAT REFLECTED THE RELEVANCE OF EACH ARTICLE TO THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES IN FRUIT ORCHARDS ON BIODIVERSITY INDICATOR SPECIES GROUPS. RESULTS: THE SEARCH RETURNED 947 INCLUDED ARTICLES. THE MAP IDENTIFIED MAJOR DIFFERENCES IN THE ATTENTION GIVEN TO DIFFERENT INDICATORS AND PRACTICES OVER TIME, RANGING FROM CLOSELY INVESTIGATED (CLUSTERS) TO NEGLECTED (GAPS) - E.G. SPIDERS AND BIRDS OR AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES WERE SHORT-TERM SURVEYS, MAINLY DONE IN LOW-STEM ORCHARDS. MAIN AREAS STUDIED WERE WESTERN EUROPE AND EASTERN NORTH AMERICA. THE RESULTING DATABASE IS PRESENTED ALONG WITH DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF EVIDENCE ACROSS TIME, INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES. CONCLUSIONS: THE CURRENT SYSTEMATIC MAP REVEALS THAT RIGOROUS AND COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATIONS ON THE SUITABILITY OF ORCHARDS AS PERENNIAL HABITATS FOR WILDLIFE, RUN ON THE LONG-TERM AND FOLLOWING A HOLISTIC APPROACH, ARE STILL BASICALLY LACKING. ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE BASE ON ORCHARD MANAGEMENT EFFECTS ON PARTICULAR ORGANISMS HAS GROWN OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, INFORMATION TO DEVELOP RELIABLE CLOSE-TO-NATURE MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND STRATEGIES IS INSUFFICIENT. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND RESEARCH SUGGEST THAT - IN VIEW OF WORLDWIDE BIODIVERSITY LOSS, WHICH MAY CAUSE A MAJOR THREAT FOR FOOD PRODUCTION - A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE PLAYED BY ORCHARDS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES FOR BIODIVERSITY IS REQUIRED. © 2020 THE AUTHOR(S).",2,NA,NA,"JEANNERET, P.; AGRARLANDSCHAFT UND BIODIVERSITÄT, RECKENHOLZSTRASSE 191, SWITZERLAND; EMAIL: PHILIPPE.JEANNERET@AGROSCOPE.ADMIN.CH",ARTICLE,10.1186/s13750-020-0185-z,NA,20472382,ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE,ENGLISH,NA,NA,7,1,NA,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD.,NA,SCOPUS,WHAT EVIDENCE EXISTS ON THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES IN FRUIT ORCHARDS ON BIODIVERSITY?

HERE, WE USED A UNIQUE DATABASE OF 220,000 LAND-USE RECORDS TO INVESTIGATE HOW 20-Y OF LAND-USE CHANGES HAVE AFFECTED FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY ACROSS MULTIPLE TROPHIC GROUPS (PRIMARY PRODUCERS, MUTUALISTS, HERBIVORES, INVERTEBRATE PREDATORS, AND VERTEBRATE PREDATORS) IN 75 GRASSLAND FIELDS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF LAND-USE HISTORIES. THE EFFECTS OF LAND-USE HISTORY ON MULTITROPHIC TRAIT DIVERSITY WERE AS STRONG AS OTHER DRIVERS KNOWN TO IMPACT BIODIVERSITY, E.G., GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT AND CURRENT LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION. THE DIVERSITY OF ANIMAL MOBILITY AND RESOURCEACQUISITION TRAITS WAS LOWER IN LANDSCAPES WHERE MUCH OF THE LAND HAD BEEN HISTORICALLY CONVERTED FROM GRASSLAND TO CROP. IN CONTRAST, FUNCTIONAL BIODIVERSITY WAS HIGHER IN LANDSCAPES CONTAINING OLD PERMANENT GRASSLANDS, MOST LIKELY BECAUSE THEY OFFER A STABLE AND HIGH-QUALITY HABITAT REFUGE FOR SPECIES WITH LOW MOBILITY AND SPECIALIZED FEEDING NICHES. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT GRASSLAND-TO-CROP CONVERSION HAS LONG-LASTING IMPACTS ON THE FUNCTIONAL BIODIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURAL ECOSYSTEMS.

TO CHARACTERIZE BOREAL FISH COMMUNITY HEALTH, WE EXAMINED FOUR INDICATORS INCLUDING SPECIES RICHNESS, TOTAL CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT, THE PROPORTION OF LITHOPHILIC SPAWNERS (FISH SENSITIVE TO SEDIMENTATION), AND THE ASSEMBLAGE TOLERANCE INDEX WHICH PROVIDES A MEASUREMENT OF THE OVERALL COMMUNITY TOLERANCE TO DISTURBANCE. LAND USE STRESSORS INCLUDED TOTAL ANTHROPOGENIC LAND USE AREA AND LINEAR DISTURBANCE AT MULTIPLE WATERSHED SCALES AS WELL AS TWO SITE-SPECIFIC HABITAT DEGRADATION INDICATORS (DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND THE PROPORTION OF FINE SUBSTRATE). OVERALL COMMUNITY RICHNESS AND PRODUCTIVITY WERE NOT NEGATIVELY RELATED TO LAND USE CHANGES INDICATING POTENTIAL COMPENSATORY DYNAMICS (E.G.

ARTAXO P,AMAZONIA.;  BIODIVERSITY;  CLIMATE CHANGE;  COVID-19,NA,"INSTITUTO DE FÍSICA, UNIVERSIDADE DE SÃO PAULOSÃO PAULO, BRAZIL",ESTUD. AV.,0,"ABSTRACT – WE ARE ENTERING AN ERA IN WHICH OUR PLANET AND OUR SOCIETY FACE MAJOR CRISES. WE LIVE SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THREE IMPORTANT EMERGENCIES: 1) THE HEALTH CRISIS, INTENSIFIED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC; 2) THE BIODIVERSITY LOSS CRISIS; AND 3) THE CLIMATIC EMERGENCY. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THESE CRISES HAVE PROFOUND LINKS BETWEEN THEM, AND ALSO IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES, BUT THEY ALL HAVE STRONG SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND AFFECT THE PLANET GLOBALLY. THEY ARE THE RESULT OF AN ECONOMIC MODEL THAT FAVORS DEVELOPMENT AT ANY COST AND VERY QUICK PROFITS EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF SUSTAINABILITY. THE COVID-19 CRISIS POSED IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF A LACK OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. IN TURN, THE CLIMATE CRISIS HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR VERY SERIOUS SOCIO-ECONOMIC DAMAGE, AND ITS EFFECTS ARE ALREADY CLEARLY VISIBLE. THE LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY PUTS OUR FOOD SECURITY AT RISK, AND THE BALANCE OF THE TERRESTRIAL SYSTEM AS WELL. THE AMAZON, FOR EXAMPLE, HARBORS THOUSANDS OF VIRUSES IN ITS FAUNA AND FLORA, AND IF THE UNRESTRAINED PROCESS OF OCCUPATION CONTINUES, NEW VIRUSES SIMILAR TO SARS-COV-2 WILL POSSIBLY COME INTO CONTACT WITH OUR SOCIETY. OVERCOMING THESE THREE CRISES REQUIRES DRASTIC CHANGES IN OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM, UNSUSTAINABLE IN ITS CURRENT FORMAT. CONTINUED ECONOMIC GROWTH ON A PLANET WITH FINITE NATURAL RESOURCES IS NOT POSSIBLE. INEQUALITY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND EVEN BETWEEN NATIONS IS EXPLOSIVE AND UNFAIR. WE WILL NEED A NEW SYSTEM OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE THAT IS ABLE TO HARMONIZE MEASURES FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES. SUSTAINABILITY ON OUR PLANET IS POSSIBLE AND NECESSARY. WE – THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, SOCIETY, GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS –WILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US IN THE COMING YEARS.

COMMON,0,"PROPERTY THEORY IS UNDERGOING A REVOLUTION. FOR DECADES, THEORISTS HAVE ENVISIONED RIGHTS AS BILATERAL, FOCUSING ON INTERSECTIONS BETWEEN DIRECTLY ADJACENT LANDOWNERS, OR LANDOWNERS AND GOVERNMENT ACTORS. THIS OVER-SIMPLIFIED, TWO-DIMENSIONAL MODEL OF PROPERTY RIGHTS HAS RESULTED IN LAWS THAT FACILITATE EPIC SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL IMBALANCES. IN THIS PAPER, WE APPLY THE EMERGENT THEORY OF MISMATCHED PROPERTY RIGHTS TO THE PROBLEM OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS. WE OBSERVE THAT WILDLIFE HABITAT FOR A SINGLE SPECIES CAN CONSIST OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES. LAND PARCELING SYSTEMS ARTIFICIALLY DIVIDE WILDLIFE HABITAT, FRAGMENTING OWNERSHIP OF LANDSCAPE-LEVEL RESOURCES. MANAGING LARGE-SCALE HABITATS REQUIRES COORDINATING THE INTERESTS OF MANY PROPERTY OWNERS, OFTEN WITH DIVERGENT VIEWS ON HABITAT MANAGEMENT. PUBLIC LANDS’ LANDSCAPE SCALE AVOIDS THIS FEATURE, BUT, NEVERTHELESS, STILL HAVE COMPETING RESOURCE USERS SEEKING TO MAXIMIZE ALLOCATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES RIGHTS. WILDLIFE HABITAT PROVIDES A PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING VARIATION ON THE THEME OF MISMATCHED PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN THIS CONTEXT, A PRIMARY STAKEHOLDER—WILDLIFE—DOES NOT OWN PROPERTY. WE SUGGEST THAT STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATIONS ARE ONE UNDERSTUDIED TOOL THAT FUNCTIONALLY REINCORPORATES WILDLIFE RESOURCE USES INTO THE EXISTING PROPERTY REGIME. COLLABORATIONS SERVE TO RE-SCALE RESOURCES SO THAT THEY CAN BE EFFICIENTLY MANAGED AT THEIR NATURAL SCALE. STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATIONS CROSS ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROPERTY BOUNDARIES TO CREATE LANDSCAPE-LEVEL MANAGEMENT PLANS, WHICH ACCOMMODATES OVERLAPPING RIGHTS WITHIN DIFFERING BOUNDARIES. IN THIS WAY, STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATIONS APPEAR TO BE PLAYING A CRUCIAL, UNDER-APPRECIATED ROLE IN STEMMING BIODIVERSITY LOSS. © 2020 THE AUTHOR(S).",NA,NA,NA,"FACEMIRE, C.; ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITYUNITED STATES; EMAIL: CFACEMIR@ASU.EDU",ARTICLE,10.5334/ijc.985,NA,18750281,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS,ENGLISH,NA,NA,2,1,650-661,"IGITUR, UTRECHT PUBLISHING AND ARCHIVING SERVICES",NA,SCOPUS,"BIODIVERSITY LOSS, VIEWED THROUGH THE LENS OF MISMATCHED PROPERTY RIGHTS",NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097558035&doi=10.5334%2fijc.985&partnerID=40&md5=abac4c6a716cf42c8af744b148704a9d,14,2020,NA NA NA,INT J COMMON,none,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY,FACEMIRE;ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITYUNITED STATES;EMAIL: CFACEMIR@ASU.EDU,NA,"FACEMIRE C, 2020, INT J COMMON","FACEMIRE C, 2020, INT J COMMON"

THE ‘PATHWAYS TO NATURE CONNECTEDNESS’ (SENSORY CONTACT, EMOTION, MEANING, BEAUTY AND COMPASSION) PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT AND FLEXIBLE FRAMEWORK TO HELP IMPROVE THE HUMAN–NATURE RELATIONSHIP. RESEARCH EVIDENCE AND PRACTICAL EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN FROM ORGANISATIONS USING THE PATHWAYS (E.G. NATIONAL TRUST, WILDLIFE TRUSTS, DURRELL WILDLIFE CONSERVATION TRUST). THIS ILLUSTRATES HOW THE PATHWAYS PROVIDE A NEW METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH FOR IMPROVING HUMAN–NATURE RELATIONSHIPS. A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE IS TAKEN TO CONSIDER WIDER APPLICATION OF THE PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK. THE SOCIETAL RELEVANCE OF THE PATHWAYS APPROACH IS PROPOSED, AND THE APPLICATION OF NATURE CONNECTEDNESS IS CONSIDERED ACROSS A RANGE OF LEVERAGE POINTS RELEVANT ACROSS MULTIPLE SOCIETAL SCALES (FROM INDIVIDUALS TO SOCIETIES).

IN FACT, TAXONOMIES INFERRED FROM STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIAGNOSTIC MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS IN THE ABSENCE OF PHYLOGENETIC CONSIDERATIONS, CAN CONTAIN NON-MONOPHYLETIC LINEAGES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE AT THE SPECIES LEVEL WHERE SMALL AMOUNTS OF GENE FLOW MAY NOT PRECLUDE THE EVOLUTION OF LOCALIZED ADAPTIONS IN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHILE UNDERPINNING THE PARAPHYLETIC NATURE OF EACH POPULATION WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER. WE ILLUSTRATE THIS POINT BY EXAMINING GENETIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION AMONG THREE PUTATIVELY ALLOPATRIC POPULATIONS OF THE GRANITE-DWELLING BENT-TOED GECKO CYRTODACTYLUS AEQUALIS FROM HILLY REGIONS IN SOUTHEASTERN MYANMAR. IN THE ABSENCE OF MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETIC INFERENCE, A COMPELLING ARGUMENT FOR THREE MORPHOLOGICALLY DIAGNOSABLE SPECIES COULD BE MARSHALED. HOWEVER, WHEN BASING THE MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSES OF GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION ON A MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY, THERE IS A MORE COMPELLING ARGUMENT THAT ONLY ONE SPECIES SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED. WE ARE COGNIZANT OF THE FACT HOWEVER, THAT WHEN DEALING WITH RARE SPECIES OR SPECIMENS FOR WHICH NO MOLECULAR DATA ARE POSSIBLE, JUDICIOUS MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSES ARE THE ONLY OPTION-AND THE DESIRED OPTION GIVEN THE CURRENT WORLDWIDE BIODIVERSITY CRISIS. © 2020 BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS.

RES.,0,"PURPOSE: THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING THE NATURAL INVENTORY MODEL (NIM) DEVELOPED BY JONES (1996, 2003) IN BIODIVERSE WILDLIFE CORRIDOR PLANTATIONS, FROM A NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS’ (NGO) PERSPECTIVE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: UNDERTAKING THE FIRST CYCLE OF AN ACTION RESEARCH APPROACH, THE PROJECT INVOLVES COLLABORATION WITH GREENING AUSTRALIA TASMANIA (GAT). GAT IS ENDEAVOURING TO ESTABLISH NATIVE WILDLIFE CORRIDORS THROUGHOUT THE TASMANIAN MIDLANDS, USING SCIENCE-BASED BIODIVERSE PLANTATIONS. THE MAJORITY OF THE AREAS IDENTIFIED BY GAT AS ESSENTIAL FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THESE WILDLIFE CORRIDORS ARE ON PRIVATELY OWNED LAND, PRIMARILY USED FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES. THIS PAPER EXPLORES WHETHER STEWARDSHIP OF THE LAND “SACRIFICED” BY LANDOWNERS MAY BE DEMONSTRATED VIA THE QUANTIFICATION AND COMMUNICATION OF IMPROVEMENTS IN BIODIVERSITY USING THE NIM. FINDINGS: RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE EXISTING NIM IS IMPRACTICAL FOR USE BY AN NGO WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. HOWEVER, WITH SOME ADAPTATIONS INCORPORATING SCIENCE-BASED MEASUREMENTS, THE NIM CAN BE USED TO ACCOUNT FOR BIODIVERSE WILDLIFE CORRIDOR PLANTATIONS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE FINDINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR NOT-FOR-PROFIT, CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT SECTORS IN TERMS OF HOW ACCOUNTING MAY FACILITATE THE QUANTIFICATION AND COMMUNICATION OF CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION EFFORTS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: BIODIVERSITY LOSS IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE A GREATER THREAT TO THE PLANET THAN CLIMATE CHANGE. EFFORTS TO ACCOUNT FOR BIODIVERSITY ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE UN 2030 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA AND THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT’S “BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION STRATEGY” (2010).

MISIDENTIFIED HABITAT REQUIREMENTS CAN HAVE SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS BECAUSE LAND PROTECTION OR REINTRODUCTIONS MIGHT OCCUR IN LESS THAN OPTIMAL HABITAT. STUDIES OF RESOURCE SELECTION HAVE GREATLY FACILITATED AN UNDERSTANDING OF ECOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS BUT CAN BE IMPROVED WHEN VITAL YET INFREQUENTLY UTILIZED HABITAT FEATURES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED. A CRITICAL ELEMENT FOR MANY PREY SPECIES IS ESCAPE TERRAIN OR SOME OTHER FORM OF REFUGE TO AVOID PREDATION. MOUNTAIN GOATS (OREAMNOS AMERICANUS) ARE WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR USE OF CLIFFS TO AVOID PREDATION, BUT A SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE REVEALED AT LEAST TWELVE DIFFERENT APPROXIMATIONS OF GOAT ESCAPE TERRAIN, RANGING FROM &GT; 25◦ TO &GT; 50◦ SLOPES. HERE, WE SEEK TO (1) ENHANCE ESTIMATES OF MOUNTAIN GOAT ESCAPE TERRAIN AND ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR, AND (2) HIGHLIGHT THE LIMITATIONS OF THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE TIME AN ANIMAL SPENDS IN AN AREA IS PROPORTIONAL TO IMPORTANCE. TO IMPROVE ESTIMATES OF GOAT ESCAPE TERRAIN, WE CONDUCTED FIELD WORK ACROSS TWO YEARS (2014–15) IN GLACIER NATIONAL PARK, MONTANA USA AND MANIPULATED APPARENT PREDATION RISK BY EXPOSING MOUNTAIN GOATS TO A THREATENING SIMULATED GRIZZLY BEAR (URSUS ARCTOS) TREATMENT AND A NON-THREATENING UNGULATE (CONTROL) TREATMENT. MOUNTAIN GOATS MOVED IN RESPONSE TO THE SIMULATED BEAR BUT NOT IN RESPONSE TO THE SIMULATED UNGULATE, WITH SHORTER LATENCIES TO MOVE FOR SUBJECTS IN LARGER GROUPS AND AT SHORTER DISTANCES TO THE SIMULATED THREAT. THROUGH A USED-UNUSED RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTION WE TESTED 22 LANDSCAPE VARIABLES TO DESCRIBE THE USE OF ESCAPE TERRAIN. PROXIMITY TO SLOPES GREATER THAN 60◦ BEST EXPLAINED THE LOCATIONS TO WHICH MOUNTAIN GOATS FLED AFTER EXPOSURE TO THE SIMULATED BEAR, AND THE AVERAGE SLOPE OF THESE ESCAPE LOCATIONS WAS 56.5◦ (±14.1 S.D.). OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MOUNTAIN GOAT ESCAPE TERRAIN BE CONSIDERED AT SLOPES OF 60◦ AS A MINIMUM BECAUSE OUR SIMULATED THREAT DID NOT INCLUDE PURSUIT OF GOATS AND, THUS, SLOPES OF 60◦ ARE LIKELY UNDERESTIMATES OF ACTUAL ESCAPE TERRAIN. ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE DIRECT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CARNIVORES AND GOATS SELDOM OCCUR, SERIOUS ESCAPE TERRAIN IS INFREQUENTLY USED. PAST ESTIMATES OF ESCAPE MAY HAVE MISCALCULATED THE SLOPES WHICH GOATS SELECT FOR IN RESPONSE TO PREDATION RISK. BASED ON EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES IN THE WILD, WE SUGGEST THAT ANTI-PREDATOR BEHAVIOR SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN STUDIES OF RESOURCE SELECTION WHEN THE GOAL IS TO CONSIDER HABITAT AS A PREDICTOR FOR CONSERVATION SUCCESS. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS EVIDENCE SUGGESTING A PAST MOUNTAIN GOAT INTRODUCTION FAILED DUE TO LACK OF ADEQUATE ESCAPE TERRAIN AND SUBSEQUENT RECOLONIZATION OF A PREDATOR.

IN THE AMAZON, THE CONSTRUCTION OF HYDROELECTRIC DAMS IS AN EMERGENT DRIVER OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS, CREATING NUMEROUS LAND-BRIDGE ISLANDS, MOST OF THEM UNABLE TO SUSTAIN AN ASSEMBLAGE OF BIRD SPECIES COMPARABLE TO THE INTACT FOREST. ALTHOUGH WE UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF FOREST FRAGMENTATION ON SPECIES RICHNESS AND DISTRIBUTION, WE STILL NEED TO UNCOVER THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE SUCCESS OF ORGANISMS LIVING IN DISTURBED HABITATS. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED FEATHER CORTICOSTERONE LEVELS AS A MEASUREMENT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICATORS OF STRESS, EVALUATING WHETHER CORTICOSTERONE LEVELS MIRROR THE EFFECTS OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION ON SPECIES OCCURRENCE. SINCE DATA SUGGEST THAT SMALLER ISLANDS CAN REDUCE HABITAT SUITABILITY, INCREASING STRESS IN BIRDS THAT LIVE WITHIN THEM, WE PREDICTED THAT BIRDS LIVING IN SMALLER ISLANDS WOULD PRESENT INCREASED FEATHER CORTICOSTERONE LEVELS. WE CAPTURED BIRDS IN 13 ISLANDS OF VARYING SIZE AND IN TWO CONTINUOUS FORESTS AND ANALYSED FEATHER CORTICOSTERONE LEVELS OF 265 INDIVIDUALS FROM EIGHT DIFFERENT SPECIES. OVERALL, OUR FINDINGS DID NOT SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CORTICOSTERONE VARIES IN RELATION TO ISLAND SIZE, EXCEPT FOR THE GUIANAN ANTWARBLER HYPOCNEMIS CANTATOR, WHICH PRESENTED THE PREDICTED PATTERN: DECREASING FEATHER CORTICOSTERONE LEVELS WITH INCREASING ISLAND SIZE. THESE DIFFERENCES SUGGEST THAT SPECIES RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO STRESSORS DRIVEN BY FRAGMENTATION. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO ASSESS THE RELIABILITY OF CORTICOSTERONE LEVELS AS A PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT OF STRESS AND TO DETERMINE WHICH PARAMETERS ARE USEFUL TO UNDERSTAND HOW INSULARISATION CAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES MAY INFLUENCE THE RESISTANCE OF AVIAN POPULATIONS TO HABITAT DISTURBANCES. - BICUDO, T., ANCIÃES, M., ARREGUI, L. & GIL, D.

BIOL.,1,"HABITAT FRAGMENTATION REPRESENTS THE SINGLE GREATEST CONSERVATION CHALLENGE OF THE 21ST CENTURY. THIS PROBLEM IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE FOR LARGE, OBLIGATE CARNIVORES LIKE PUMAS PUMA CONCOLOR WHICH HAVE PERSISTED IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA IN THE FACE OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION AND OTHER ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES. SHRINKING HABITAT AND REDUCED CONNECTIVITY MEAN THAT MAPPING HABITAT IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT FOR SPECIES CONSERVATION IN MULTIPLE-USE LANDSCAPES. PREVIOUS WORK SUGGESTS THAT PUMAS OCCUPY HABITATS WHERE SUFFICIENT STALKING COVER AND PREFERRED PREY ARE PRESENT, YET THE INTERSECTION OF THESE FACTORS HAS RARELY BEEN ASSESSED. HERE WE USED DATA FROM 68 299 CAMERA TRAP NIGHTS COLLECTED FROM 181 SITES THROUGHOUT THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD TO IDENTIFY KEY PREDICTORS OF HABITAT OCCUPANCY FOR PUMAS AND THEIR PRIMARY PREY (MULE DEER ODOCOILEUS HEMIONUS). OUR GOAL WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER PUMAS OCCUPY HABITATS BASED ON RELATIVE MEASURES OF PREY AVAILABILITY (DETECTION FREQUENCY), OR EASE OF PREDATION (DENSITY OF STALKING COVER) AND WHETHER THESE PREDICTORS CHANGED BETWEEN SEASONS. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT PUMAS PRIMARILY OCCUPIED FORESTED HABITATS AND DID NOT CHOOSE HABITATS WITH ABUNDANT DEER. INSTEAD, PUMAS PREFERENTIALLY OCCUPY HABITATS THAT FACILITATE THEIR STALK AND AMBUSH HUNTING STRATEGY, RATHER THAN HIGHER PREY DENSITIES, PER SE. THE BEST OCCUPANCY MODELS FOR MULE DEER INDICATED THE IMPORTANCE OF ROADS AND SHRUB COVER. HOWEVER, EVEN THE BEST DEER MODELS PERFORMED POORLY COMPARED TO THE PUMA MODELS, LIKELY DUE TO THE UBIQUITY OF MULE DEER IN THE REGION. ALTHOUGH PREY DENSITY IS A WIDELY ACCEPTED CORRELATE OF HABITAT QUALITY FOR MANY CARNIVORES, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF HABITAT MAY BE A MORE IMPORTANT VARIABLE IN PREDICTING HABITAT USE BY LARGE STALK AND AMBUSH PREDATORS LIKE PUMAS, WHICH HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION SUCCESS. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.",540,NA,WIBIF,"COON, C.A.C.; FELIDAE CONSERVATION FUND, 110 TIBURON BLVD.

FOR THIS REASON, MANY STUDIES ON THE SOCIAL SCIENCE OF RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE SEEK TO QUANTIFY BIODIVERSITY OUTCOMES. HERE, WE FOCUS ON THE INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY RESOURCES AND INSTITUTIONS PROGRAM TO DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF QUANTITATIVE BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT AND SUGGEST WAYS TO OVERCOME THEM. ONE OF THIS PROGRAM’S RESEARCH GOALS IS TO UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS, WHICH IS EXPLICITLY ASSESSED USING PLOT-BASED FOREST SAMPLING. PLOT-BASED METHODS TO CAPTURE BIODIVERSITY CHANGES REQUIRE HUGE AMOUNTS OF DATA. EVEN IF SAMPLING IS SUFFICIENT, EXISTING PROTOCOLS CAN ONLY CAPTURE CHANGES IN THE TYPES OF SPECIES ACTUALLY SAMPLED, TYPICALLY TREES. OTHER ELEMENTS OF BIODIVERSITY ARE NOT CENSUSED, INCLUDING ANIMALS, HERBS, SHRUBS, FUNGI, AND EPIPHYTES THAT MAY PROVIDE MEDICINE, FOOD, WILDLIFE HABITAT, TRADE ITEMS, OR CULTURAL GOODS. USING CASE STUDIES OF TWO SITES IN UGANDA, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT MORE SPATIALLY EXTENSIVE SURVEYS TARGETING MULTIPLE TYPES OF DATA CAN GIVE A BROADER PICTURE OF FOREST STATUS AND CHANGES THAN CAN PLOT-BASED SAMPLING ALONE; MANY RELEVANT VARIABLES CAN BE OBSERVED WHILE TRAVELING AMONG PLOT POINTS WITH LITTLE ADDITIONAL EFFORT. REVIEWING THE ECOLOGICAL LITERATURE, WE IDENTIFY CORRELATES OF FOREST STATUS THAT CAN SUPPLEMENT PLOT-BASED SAMPLING. THESE INCLUDE LARGE TREES, EPIPHYTE-LADEN TREES, CULTURALLY OR COMMERCIALLY VALUABLE SPECIES, LARGE STUMPS, AND EVIDENCE OF HUNTING AND TRAPPING. FURTHER, DATA ELICITED FROM LOCAL RESOURCE USERS CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN BIODIVERSITY MONITORING. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT EFFECTIVE BIODIVERSITY MONITORING MAY BE WITHIN EASIER REACH THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT, ALTHOUGH ROBUST COMPARISONS AMONG SITES REMAINS A CHALLENGE, ESPECIALLY WHEN CLIMATE, SOILS, OR SITE HISTORY DIFFER GREATLY. © 2020 BY THE AUTHOR(S).",7,NA,NA,NA,ARTICLE,10.5751/ES-11223-250107,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, NSF, 1849414, DEB-1114984 MAKERERE UNIVERSITYMAKERERE UNIVERSITY, MAK",17083087,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,ENGLISH,NA,NA,4,1,NA,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,NA,SCOPUS,THINKING OUTSIDE THE PLOT: MONITORING FOREST BIODIVERSITY FOR SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083735368&doi=10.5751%2fES-11223-250107&partnerID=40&md5=d85e7c844213adb2f7f7dd4f410d1174,25,2020,"WE THANK SAMUEL MATOVU, SYLVESTER SEKINDI, AND THE OTHER WORKERS OF THE UGANDAN FORESTRY RESOURCES AND INSTITUTIONS PROGRAM AT MAKERERE UNIVERSITY WHO COLLECTED THE IFRI DATA USED IN THIS STUDY.

WE INVESTIGATED THE DIET OF A FOREST-DWELLING FROG SPECIES, MORAFKA'S FROG (ODORRANA MORAFKAI), IN A HIGHLAND FOREST IN VIETNAM IN RELATION TO HABITAT DISTURBANCE, SEX AND SEASON. WE SURVEYED THE SPECIES AT 45 SITES IN FOREST OF VARYING DISTURBANCE AND EXAMINED ITS DIET USING STOMACH FLUSHING, ESTIMATING PREY AVAILABILITY VIA TRAPPING. WE DETECTED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER O. MORAFKAI IN HIGHLY DISTURBED HABITATS COMPARED TO MODERATELY DISTURBED OR NON-DISTURBED HABITATS. WE REVEALED THAT O. MORAFKAI IS A DIETARY GENERALIST, IDENTIFYING 28 PREY TYPES, PRIMARILY INVERTEBRATES. PREY COMPOSITION, THE NUMBER OF PREY ITEMS PER STOMACH AND PREY VOLUME PER STOMACH DID NOT VARY BETWEEN DISTURBANCE LEVELS. DIET DID NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN SEXES, EXCEPT THAT FEMALES HAD A HIGHER PREY VOLUME. PREY COMPOSITION IN THE SPECIES VARIED BETWEEN SEASONS, WITH COLEOPTERA AND ORTHOPTERA DOMINATING THE DIET IN THE RAINY SEASON AND LEPIDOPTERA IN THE DRY SEASON. THE NUMBER OF PREY ITEMS PER STOMACH AND PREY VOLUME WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE RAINY SEASON. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN PREY AVAILABILITY AND DIET COMPOSITION. THE LOW NUMBER OF O. MORAFKAI DETECTED IN HIGHLY DISTURBED HABITATS SUGGESTS THAT THIS HABITAT MAY NOT BE OPTIMAL FOR THE SPECIES, DESPITE HAVING A GENERALIST FEEDING STRATEGY AND PRESUMED HIGH MOBILITY.

IN THE LAURENTIAN GREAT LAKES, WETLANDS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY LOST AS A RESULT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE PRACTICE, YET HIGH SPECIES RICHNESS AND SEVERAL AT-RISK FISHES PERSIST. THESE PATTERNS LEAD TO THE HYPOTHESIS THAT GREAT LAKES WETLAND FISHES ARE IN EXTINCTION DEBT, MEANING THERE IS A TIME LAG BETWEEN HABITAT LOSS AND LOCAL EXTINCTION. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE SAMPLED CURRENT SPECIES RICHNESS OF WETLAND-SPECIALIST FISHES IN PROTECTED AND UNPROTECTED WETLANDS IN THE LAKE ERIE BASIN. WE PREDICTED SPECIES RICHNESS IN UNPROTECTED WETLANDS USING PARAMETER ESTIMATES (SLOPE AND INTERCEPT) FROM PROTECTED WETLANDS. EXTINCTION DEBT WAS MEASURED AS A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PREDICTED AND OBSERVED SPECIES RICHNESS. WE DETERMINED HOW MUCH AREA WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT CURRENT SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMPARED THIS TO MINIMUM-AREA REQUIREMENTS FOR EIGHT AT-RISK FISHES. SPECIES RICHNESS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN PREDICTED IN UNPROTECTED WETLANDS, INDICATING THAT FISHES IN THEM ARE IN EXTINCTION DEBT. THIS RESULT INDICATES THAT THERE IS TIME AVAILABLE TO RESTORE DISTURBED WETLANDS AND PREVENT LOCAL EXTINCTION. WE IDENTIFIED 17 WETLANDS OF HIGH PRIORITY FOR RESTORATION (&GT;10 SPECIES BOUND FOR EXTINCTION) AND DETERMINED THAT THE RESTORATION OF 178 KM2 OF WETLAND HABITAT WOULD REDUCE THE RISK OF FUTURE BIODIVERSITY LOSS.

HOWEVER, WHETHER BIODIVERSITY LOSS OCCURS IN RESPONSE TO REDUCTIONS IN HABITAT AMOUNT VERSUS REDUCTIONS IN CONNECTIVITY IN FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPES IS DEBATED. A CHALLENGE IN RESOLVING THIS ISSUE IS THAT MEASURES OF THE AMOUNT OF NATIVE WOODY VEGETATION COVER AND THOSE CALCULATED FOR STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY ARE OFTEN HIGHLY CORRELATED. USING MULTI-SEASON DETECTION-OCCUPANCY MODELS WE ADDRESS THE QUESTION: AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF NATIVE WOODY VEGETATION COVER, WHAT IS THE CONTRIBUTION OF STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY TO SITE OCCUPANCY, SITE PERSISTENCE AND SITE COLONIZATION BY BIRDS? IN THIS CONTEXT, STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY CORRESPONDED TO THE CONFIGURATION OF VEGETATION COVER IN THE LANDSCAPE SURROUNDING OUR SITES. WE CONSTRUCTED MULTI-SEASON DETECTION-OCCUPANCY MODELS FOR 44 INDIVIDUAL BIRD SPECIES BASED ON LONG-TERM FIELD SURVEYS IN THE TEMPERATE WOODLANDS OF EASTERN AUSTRALIA. WE FOUND RESPONSES TO VEGETATION AMOUNT WERE FAR MORE PREVALENT THAN RESPONSES TO STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY (35 VS 6 SPECIES). THE RANGE OF RESPONSES BY DIFFERENT SPECIES TO VEGETATION AMOUNT, TO STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY, OR TO BOTH, SUGGESTS THAT THESE ELEMENTS HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON THE PROCESSES OF OCCUPANCY, PERSISTENCE AND COLONIZATION. THE PREDOMINANCE OF VEGETATION AMOUNT EFFECTS IN OUR STUDY, PARTICULARLY THE POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR A RANGE OF SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN, SUGGESTS THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF BOTH CONSERVING EXISTING AREAS OF NATIVE VEGETATION COVER AND INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF THAT COVER. AT LEAST FOR BIRDS, EFFORTS TO PHYSICALLY CONNECT PARTICULAR PATCHES MAY HAVE RELATIVELY LESS BENEFIT COMPARED TO PROGRAMS TO BOOST OVERALL VEGETATION COVER. © 2019 ELSEVIER LTD",108377,NA,BICOB,"LINDENMAYER, D.B.; FENNER SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY, 141 LINNAEUS WAY, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: DAVID.LINDENMAYER@ANU.EDU.AU",ARTICLE,10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108377,"LP160100243 AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCILAUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL, ARC AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITYAUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, ANU IAN POTTER FOUNDATIONIAN POTTER FOUNDATION, IPF VINCENT FAIRFAX FAMILY FOUNDATIONVINCENT FAIRFAX FAMILY FOUNDATION, VFFF",63207,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,NA,NA,13,NA,NA,ELSEVIER LTD,NA,SCOPUS,HABITAT AMOUNT VERSUS CONNECTIVITY: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF BIRD RESPONSES,NA,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076149313&doi=10.1016%2fj.biocon.2019.108377&partnerID=40&md5=d7d0febc2da2806167aff4e7d83f1be7,241,2020,"FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT WAS PROVIDED BY THE AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL, MURRAY LOCAL LAND SERVICES AND RIVERINA LOCAL LAND SERVICES UNDER THE LINKAGE GRANT PROGRAM (LP160100243).

WHILE PROTECTING INTACT OR SEMI-INTACT BIODIVERSE FOREST IS PARAMOUNT, IMPROVING BIODIVERSITY VALUE WITHIN THE 11.4 MILLION HECTARES OF EXISTING RUBBER PLANTATIONS COULD OFFER IMPORTANT CONSERVATION BENEFITS, IF YIELDS ARE ALSO MAINTAINED. SOME FARMERS PRACTICE AGROFORESTRY WITH HIGH-YIELDING CLONAL RUBBER VARIETIES TO INCREASE AND DIVERSIFY INCOMES. HERE, WE ASK WHETHER SUCH RUBBER AGROFORESTRY IMPROVES BIODIVERSITY VALUE OR AFFECTS RUBBER YIELDS RELATIVE TO MONOCULTURE. WE SURVEYED BIRDS, FRUIT-FEEDING BUTTERFLIES AND REPTILES IN 25 MONOCULTURAL AND 39 AGROFOREST SMALLHOLDER RUBBER PLOTS IN THAILAND, THE WORLD'S BIGGEST RUBBER PRODUCER. MANAGEMENT AND VEGETATION STRUCTURE DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM EACH PLOT, AND LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AROUND PLOTS WAS QUANTIFIED. RUBBER YIELD DATA WERE COLLECTED FOR A SEPARATE SET OF 34 MONOCULTURAL AND 47 AGROFOREST RUBBER PLOTS IN THE SAME REGION. REPORTED RUBBER YIELDS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN AGROFORESTS AND MONOCULTURES, MEANING ADOPTION OF AGROFORESTRY IN THIS CONTEXT SHOULD NOT INCREASE LAND DEMAND FOR NATURAL RUBBER. BUTTERFLY RICHNESS WAS GREATER IN AGROFORESTS, WHERE RICHNESS INCREASED WITH GREATER NATURAL FOREST EXTENT IN THE LANDSCAPE. BIRD AND REPTILE RICHNESS WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN AGROFORESTS AND MONOCULTURES, BUT BIRD RICHNESS INCREASED WITH THE HEIGHT OF HERBACEOUS VEGETATION INSIDE RUBBER PLOTS. SPECIES COMPOSITION OF BUTTERFLIES DIFFERED BETWEEN AGROFORESTS AND MONOCULTURES, AND IN RESPONSE TO NATURAL FOREST EXTENT, WHILE BIRD COMPOSITION WAS INFLUENCED BY HERBACEOUS VEGETATION HEIGHT WITHIN PLOTS, THE DENSITY OF NON-RUBBER TREES WITHIN PLOTS (REPRESENTING AGROFORESTRY COMPLEXITY) AND NATURAL FOREST EXTENT IN THE LANDSCAPE. REPTILE COMPOSITION WAS INFLUENCED BY CANOPY COVER AND OPEN HABITAT EXTENT IN THE LANDSCAPE. CONSERVATION PRIORITY AND FOREST-DEPENDENT BIRDS WERE NOT SUPPORTED WITHIN RUBBER. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. RUBBER AGROFORESTRY USING CLONAL VARIETIES PROVIDES MODEST BIODIVERSITY BENEFITS RELATIVE TO MONOCULTURES, WITHOUT COMPROMISING YIELDS. AGROFORESTS MAY ALSO GENERATE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE AND LIVELIHOOD BENEFITS. MANAGEMENT OF MONOCULTURAL RUBBER PRODUCTION TO INCREASE INTER-ROW VEGETATION HEIGHT AND COMPLEXITY MAY FURTHER BENEFIT BIODIVERSITY. HOWEVER, BIODIVERSITY LOSSES FROM ENCROACHMENT OF RUBBER ONTO FORESTS WILL NOT BE OFFSET BY RUBBER AGROFORESTRY OR RUBBER PLOT MANAGEMENT. THIS EVIDENCE IS IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPING GUIDELINES AROUND BIODIVERSITY-FRIENDLY RUBBER AND SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAINS, AND FOR FARMERS INTERESTED IN DIVERSIFYING RUBBER PRODUCTION. © 2019 THE AUTHORS.

APPL. ECOL.,1,"A KEY CHALLENGE IN CONSERVATION BIOLOGY IS THAT NOT ALL SPECIES ARE EQUALLY LIKELY TO GO EXTINCT WHEN FACED WITH A DISTURBANCE, BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE OVERLAPPING REASONS FOR SUCH DIFFERENCES IN EXTINCTION PROBABILITY. DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES EXTINCTION RISK MAY REPRESENT EXTINCTION SELECTIVITY, A NON-RANDOM PROCESS BY WHICH SPECIES’ RISKS OF EXTINCTION ARE CAUSED BY DIFFERENCES IN FITNESS BASED ON TRAITS. ADDITIONALLY, RARE SPECIES WITH LOW ABUNDANCES AND/OR OCCUPANCIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO EXTINCT THAN COMMON SPECIES FOR REASONS OF RANDOM CHANCE ALONE, THAT IS, BAD LUCK. UNLESS ECOLOGISTS AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGISTS CAN DISENTANGLE RANDOM AND SELECTIVE EXTINCTION PROCESSES, THEN THE PREDICTION AND PREVENTION OF FUTURE EXTINCTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN ELUSIVE CHALLENGE. WE SUGGEST THAT A MODIFIED VERSION OF A COMMON NULL MODEL PROCEDURE, RAREFACTION, CAN BE USED TO DISENTANGLE THE INFLUENCE OF STOCHASTIC SPECIES LOSS FROM SELECTIVE NON-RANDOM PROCESSES. TO THIS END WE APPLIED A RAREFACTION-BASED NULL MODEL TO THREE PUBLISHED DATA SETS TO CHARACTERIZE THE INFLUENCE OF SPECIES RARITY IN DRIVING BIODIVERSITY LOSS FOLLOWING THREE BIODIVERSITY LOSS EVENTS: (A) DISEASE-ASSOCIATED BAT DECLINES; (B) DISEASE-ASSOCIATED AMPHIBIAN DECLINES; AND (C) HABITAT LOSS AND INVASIVE SPECIES-ASSOCIATED GASTROPOD DECLINES. FOR EACH CASE STUDY, WE USED RAREFACTION TO GENERATE NULL EXPECTATIONS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND SPECIES-SPECIFIC EXTINCTION PROBABILITIES. IN EACH OF OUR CASE STUDIES, WE FIND EVIDENCE FOR BOTH RANDOM AND NON-RANDOM (SELECTIVE) EXTINCTIONS. OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPLICITLY CONSIDERING THAT SOME SPECIES EXTINCTIONS ARE THE RESULT OF STOCHASTIC PROCESSES. IN OTHER WORDS, WE FIND SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE FOR BAD LUCK IN THE EXTINCTION PROCESS. POLICY IMPLICATIONS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT RAREFACTION CAN BE USED TO DISENTANGLE RANDOM AND NON-RANDOM EXTINCTIONS AND GUIDE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, RAREFACTION CAN BE USED RETROSPECTIVELY TO IDENTIFY WHEN DECLINES OF AT-RISK SPECIES ARE LIKELY TO RESULT FROM SELECTIVITY, VERSUS RANDOM CHANCE. RAREFACTION CAN ALSO BE USED PROSPECTIVELY TO FORMULATE MINIMUM PREDICTIONS OF SPECIES LOSS IN RESPONSE TO HYPOTHETICAL DISTURBANCES. GIVEN ITS MINIMAL DATA REQUIREMENTS AND FAMILIARITY AMONG ECOLOGISTS, RAREFACTION MAY BE AN EFFICIENT AND VERSATILE TOOL FOR IDENTIFYING AND PROTECTING SPECIES THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO GLOBAL EXTINCTION. © 2019 THE AUTHORS.

BATS WERE SAMPLED ON 11 ISLANDS AND THE ADJACENT MAINLAND IN PANAMA, AND IN EIGHT FOREST FRAGMENTS AND NEARBY CONTINUOUS FOREST IN BRAZIL. SPECIES–AREA RELATIONSHIPS (SAR) WERE ASSESSED BASED ON CHAO1 SPECIES RICHNESS ESTIMATES, AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY–AREA RELATIONSHIPS (FAR) WERE QUANTIFIED USING CHAO1 FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY ESTIMATES MEASURED AS THE TOTAL BRANCH LENGTH OF A TRAIT DENDROGRAM. FARS WERE CALCULATED USING THREE TRAIT SETS: CONSIDERING FIVE SPECIES FUNCTIONAL TRAITS (FARALL), AND TRAIT SUBSETS REFLECTING ‘DIET BREADTH’ (FARDIET) AND ‘DISPERSAL ABILITY’ (FARDISPERSAL). WE FOUND THAT IN BOTH STUDY SYSTEMS, FARALL WAS LESS SENSITIVE TO HABITAT LOSS THAN SAR, IN THE SENSE THAT AN EQUAL REDUCTION IN HABITAT LOSS LED TO A DISPROPORTIONATELY SMALLER LOSS OF FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY COMPARED TO SPECIES RICHNESS. HOWEVER, THE INHOSPITABLE AND STATIC AQUATIC MATRIX IN THE ISLAND ECOSYSTEM RESULTED IN MORE PRONOUNCED SPECIES LOSS WITH INCREASING LOSS OF HABITAT COMPARED TO THE COUNTRYSIDE ECOSYSTEM. MOREOVER, WHILE WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT FARDISPERSAL FOR THE ISLAND ECOSYSTEM IN RELATION TO FOREST COVER WITHIN 500 M LANDSCAPE BUFFERS, FARDIET AND FARDISPERSAL WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE ECOSYSTEM. OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THAT SPECIES RICHNESS AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY IN ISLAND AND COUNTRYSIDE ECOSYSTEMS SCALE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENTLY WITH HABITAT LOSS, AND SUGGEST THAT KEY BAT ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS POLLINATION, SEED DISPERSAL AND ARTHROPOD SUPPRESSION, MAY BE MAINTAINED IN FRAGMENTS DESPITE A REDUCTION IN SPECIES RICHNESS.

IN VIEW OF THE EAST KOLKATA WETLANDS (EKW), INDIA, THIS PAPER HAS EXAMINED THE TREND, CAUSES, EXTENT AND IMPACTS OF LANDSCAPE TRANSFORMATION DURING THE LAST FEW DECADES. HENCE WE AIM TO PRESENT A REVIEW OF SEVERAL STUDIES IN AND AROUND EKW AND SUGGESTS A SUSTAINABLE MODEL FOR EKW. THIS ‘RAMSAR SITE OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE’ IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST WASTEWATER-FED AQUACULTURE SYSTEMS WHERE THE CITY SEWAGE IS RECYCLED FOR PISCICULTURE AND AGRICULTURE, AND ACTS AS FLOOD RESISTANCE FOR THE CITY OF KOLKATA. RAPID ENCROACHMENT IN THE EKW DUE TO UNPLANNED DEVELOPMENT HAS CAUSED VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS. THE KEY ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS FOUND IN THE STUDY INCLUDED LOSS OF FAUNAL AND FLORAL DIVERSITY, ECO-TOXICOLOGICAL IMPACTS, ETC. IN TERMS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS, WHILE THE NUMBER OF BIRD SPECIES IN THE EKW DECREASED FROM 248 IN 1960S TO 72 IN 2005, ABOUT 59% FISH SPECIES ARE NEAR THREATS, VULNERABLE AND ENDANGERED. REPORTED PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS (POPS) AROUND THE EKW REGION WERE FOUND TO POSE DELETERIOUS IMPACT ON ENVIRONMENT AND AMBIENT BIOTA. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE EVIDENCED THAT THE OPEN BURNING OF SOLID WASTE IN THE DUMPING GROUND OF DHAPA IS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (PCBS) AND POLYCHLORINATED DIBENZO DIOXIN/FURANS (PCDD/FS). FURTHER THE ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE EKW FOCUSSING ON POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ISSUES HAS BEEN STUDIED IN THIS PAPER. THE ASPECTS OF ENCROACHMENT AND WETLAND SHRINKAGE TRIGGERED BY ECONOMIC DRIVERS LIKE URBAN SPRAWL HAVE BEEN ANALYZED. THE PAPER PRESENTS ADAPTIVE CO-MANAGEMENT AS THE FUTURE ROADMAP FOR ACTION TO CURB FURTHER DEGRADATION OF THE WETLANDS, AND ADOPT AN INTEGRATED APPROACH OF ENVIRONMENTAL, POLITICAL, PHYSICAL, ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS.
