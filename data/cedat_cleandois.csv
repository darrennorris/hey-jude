VOLUNTEERS CAN HELP TO COLLECT INFORMATION OVER LARGE SCALES, BUT THEIR DATA MAY BE AFFECTED BY HETEROGENEITY FOR SAMPLING EFFORTS AND PROTOCOLS, WHICH MAY INFLUENCE DETECTION PROBABILITY. IGNORING THIS ISSUE MAY CONDUCT TO MISLEADING CONCLUSIONS. HERE WE SHOW THAT DATA COLLECTED BY DIFFERENT VOLUNTEER GROUPS CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH MEASURES OF SAMPLING EFFORTS, TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON LARGE SCALE DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS. WE COLLECTED DATA ON 33 COMMON TOAD (BUFO BUFO) POPULATIONS ACROSS ITALY FOR THE PERIOD 1993-2010. WE USED TWO APPROACHES (META-ANALYSIS; ANALYSIS OF AVERAGE CHANGE IN POPULATION SIZE) TO EVALUATE THE OVERALL DEMOGRAPHIC TREND. WE INCORPORATED MEASURES OF VOLUNTEER SAMPLING EFFORTS INTO ANALYSES, TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CHANGES IN DETECTION PROBABILITY. TOAD ABUNDANCE SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED IN THE LAST DECADE. FROM 2000 TO 2010, 70\% OF POPULATIONS SHOWED A STRONG DECLINE, AND ONLY 10\% INCREASED. TRENDS WERE HETEROGENEOUS AMONG POPULATIONS, BUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SAMPLING EFFORT REDUCED HETEROGENEITY BY 40\%. WE DETECTED A 76\% CUMULATIVE AVERAGE DECLINE OF TOAD POPULATIONS, DESPITE AN INCREASING MEAN SAMPLING EFFORT. THE WIDESPREAD TOAD DECLINE RISES CONCERN FOR ITS FUTURE, ALSO BECAUSE THE CAUSES REMAIN UNCLEAR. VOLUNTEER DATA CAN BE EXTREMELY USEFUL TO IDENTIFY LARGE SCALE POPULATION TRENDS, IF INFORMATION ON SAMPLING EFFORT ARE RECORDED AND USED TO ADJUST COUNTS. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER LTD.

THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THESE CONCENTRATIONS DO NOT NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE SURVIVAL OF THE HOST OR THE PATHOGEN. HOWEVER, CONCENTRATIONS GREATER THAN 3 PPT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE GROWTH AND MOTILITY OF THE CHYTRID FUNGUS COMPARED TO 0 PPT. CONCENTRATIONS OF 1-4 PPT NACL WERE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER HOST INFECTION LOADS WHILE INFECTED HOSTS EXPOSED TO 3 AND 4 PPT NACL WERE FOUND TO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SURVIVAL RATES. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL FOR NACL TO BE USED AS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY DISTRIBUTED ANTIFUNGAL AGENT FOR THE PREVENTION OF CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS IN SUSCEPTIBLE AMPHIBIAN HOSTS. HOWEVER, FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY ANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SALT EXPOSURE ON BOTH TARGET AND NON-TARGET ORGANISMS PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION.",1

TO MITIGATE AGAINST THESE EFFECTS AND COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES INSTALL BRIDGES, GANTRIES OR UNDERPASSES TO MAKE ROADS PERMEABLE AND SAFER TO CROSS. HOWEVER, THROUGH LACK OF APPROPRIATE MONITORING, THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. THREE UNDERPASSES AND FOUR BAT GANTRIES WERE INVESTIGATED IN NORTHERN ENGLAND. ECHOLOCATION CALL RECORDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF BATS USING UNDERPASSES IN PREFERENCE TO CROSSING THE ROAD ABOVE, AND THE HEIGHT AT WHICH BATS CROSSED. AT GANTRIES, PROXIMITY TO THE GANTRY AND HEIGHT OF CROSSING BATS WERE MEASURED. DATA WERE COMPARED TO THOSE FROM ADJACENT, SEVERED COMMUTING ROUTES THAT HAD NO CROSSING STRUCTURE. AT ONE UNDERPASS 96% OF BATS FLEW THROUGH IT IN PREFERENCE TO CROSSING THE ROAD. THIS UNDERPASS WAS LOCATED ON A PRE-CONSTRUCTION COMMUTING ROUTE THAT ALLOWED BATS TO PASS WITHOUT CHANGING FLIGHT HEIGHT OR DIRECTION. AT TWO UNDERPASSES ATTEMPTS TO DIVERT BATS FROM THEIR ORIGINAL COMMUTING ROUTES WERE UNSUCCESSFUL AND BATS CROSSED THE ROAD AT THE HEIGHT OF PASSING VEHICLES. UNDERPASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ALLOW BATS TO CROSS ROADS SAFELY IF BUILT ON PRE-CONSTRUCTION COMMUTING ROUTES. BAT GANTRIES WERE INEFFECTIVE AND USED BY A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF BATS, EVEN UP TO NINE YEARS AFTER CONSTRUCTION. MOST BATS NEAR GANTRIES CROSSED ROADS ALONG SEVERED, PRE-CONSTRUCTION COMMUTING ROUTES AT HEIGHTS THAT PUT THEM IN THE PATH OF VEHICLES. CROSSING HEIGHT WAS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH VERGE HEIGHT, SUGGESTING THAT ELEVATED VERGES MAY HAVE SOME VALUE IN MITIGATION, BUT INCREASED FLIGHT HEIGHT MAY BE AT THE COST OF REDUCED PERMEABILITY. GREEN BRIDGES SHOULD BE EXPLORED AS AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF MITIGATION. ROBUST MONITORING IS ESSENTIAL TO ASSESS OBJECTIVELY THE CASE FOR MITIGATION AND TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE MITIGATION.",2

AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES (AES) HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN MANY COUNTRIES AS AN ATTEMPT TO COUNTERACT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE BY PROVIDING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR FARMERS TO ADOPT ENVIRONMENTALLY-SENSITIVE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. WE SURVEYED 18 PAIRS OF AES AND CONVENTIONALLY-MANAGED FARMS IN CENTRAL SCOTLAND (UNITED KINGDOM) TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC AES MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTIONS (FIELD MARGINS, HEDGEROWS, SPECIES-RICH GRASSLANDS AND WATER MARGINS) ON FORAGING BATS AND NOCTURNAL INSECTS. IN ADDITION, WE ASSESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF HABITAT IN THE WIDER LANDSCAPE AT SEVERAL SPATIAL SCALES ON FORAGING BATS AND THEIR INSECT PREY. PIPISTRELLUS PYGMAEUS AND PIPISTRELLUS PIPISTRELLUS WERE THE MOST COMMONLY RECORDED SPECIES, ACCOUNTING FOR 98\% OF TOTAL BAT ACTIVITY LEVELS. OVERALL LEVELS OF BAT ACTIVITY AND THE ABUNDANCE OF THEIR INSECT PREY (MAINLY DIPTERA AND TRICHOPTERA) WERE LOWER (BY 40-50\%) ON FARMS PARTICIPATING IN AES THAN ON NON-PARTICIPATING FARMS. DIFFERENCES IN INSECT ABUNDANCE WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT WHEN WE COMPARED SPECIFIC AES MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTIONS WITH EQUIVALENT CONVENTIONALLY-MANAGED FEATURES. THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE INFLUENCED BAT ACTIVITY; FRAGMENTATION METRICS RELATED TO WOODLAND CONFIGURATION WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS INFLUENCING BAT ACTIVITY LEVELS. HOWEVER, THE TWO PIPISTRELLE SPECIES RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE, P. PIPISTRELLUS BEING STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE LANDSCAPE AT LARGE SCALES (E.G. WITHIN 2 KM OF THE MONITORING SITE) AND P. PYGMAEUS BEING MOST INFLUENCED BY THE LANDSCAPE AT SMALLER SCALES (WITHIN 500 M OF THE MONITORING SITE). INSECT ABUNDANCE WAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PERCENTAGE COVER OF SEMI-NATURAL ENVIRONMENT WITHIN 500 M OF TRAPPING SITES. WE SUGGEST THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FOUR COMMON AES MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTIONS ASSESSED IN THIS STUDY DOES NOT BENEFIT PIPISTRELLE BATS NOR OTHER BAT SPECIES FORAGING ON SIMILAR PREY. SUCH SPECIES MAY RESPOND MORE POSITIVELY TO A LANDSCAPE-SCALE MANAGEMENT APPROACH FOCUSED MAINLY ON THE CREATION AND MANAGEMENT OF WOODLAND. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",5

TO PROTECT THE BATS AND THE CAVE SYSTEM THE VISITOR SCHEDULE TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE DIFFERENCES IN SEASONAL USE OF THE CAVES BY BATS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BATS RECORDED IN THE CAVE SYSTEM AFTER OPENING FOR TOURISM, POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE GATING OF TWO ENTRANCES HELPED TO CONTROL VISITATION. THE RESULTS OF OUR SURVEYS OF THIS CAVE SYSTEM SHOW THAT GATING OF ENTRANCES AND VISITS BY TOURISTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE USE OF CAVES BY BATS FOR BOTH HIBERNATING AND NURSING.

TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF AGROECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT ON INSECTIVOROUS BATS, WE STUDIED THEIR DIVERSITY AND ACTIVITY IN SOUTHERN CHIAPAS, MEXICO, A LANDSCAPE DOMINATED BY COFFEE AGROFORESTRY. WE USED ACOUSTIC MONITORING AND LIVE CAPTURES TO CHARACTERIZE THE INSECTIVOROUS BAT ENSEMBLE IN FOREST FRAGMENTS AND COFFEE PLANTATIONS DIFFERING IN THE STRUCTURAL AND TAXONOMIC COMPLEXITY OF SHADE TREES. WE CAPTURED BATS OF 12 NON-PHYLLOSTOMID SPECIES; ACOUSTIC MONITORING REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF AT LEAST 12 MORE SPECIES OF AERIAL INSECTIVORES. RICHNESS OF FOREST BATS WAS THE SAME ACROSS ALL LAND-USE TYPES; IN CONTRAST, SPECIES RICHNESS OF OPEN-SPACE BATS INCREASED IN LOW SHADE, INTENSIVELY MANAGED COFFEE PLANTATIONS. CONVERSELY, ONLY FOREST BATS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN ENSEMBLE STRUCTURE (AS MEASURED BY SIMILARITY INDICES) ACROSS LAND-USE TYPES.

FROM FEBRUARY 2007 TO AUGUST 2009, WE MONITORED CROP-RAIDING PATTERNS ACROSS A SUMATRAN AGROFOREST LANDSCAPE TO DETERMINE BACKGROUND LEVELS OF HUMAN-ORANGUTAN CONFLICT. WE ALSO INTENSIVELY MONITORED A SUBSET OF 50 FARMS TO ASSESS CHANGES IN FARMER ATTITUDES TOWARDS ORANGUTAN MANAGEMENT; DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FARMER REPORTED AND INDEPENDENTLY ENUMERATED MONETARY LOSS FROM CROP RAIDING; AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MITIGATION TECHNIQUES IN REDUCING ORANGUTAN CROP RAIDING ON 35 TREATMENT FARMS (25 TRIALLING NOISE DETERRENTS AND 10 TRIALLING TREE NETS) IN COMPARISON WITH 15 CONTROL FARMS OVER A PRE-TRIAL (12 MONTH) AND A TRIAL (18 MONTH) PHASE. FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE TRIALS HAD ENDED, THE ONGOING USE OR UPTAKE OF THE TECHNIQUES WERE ASSESSED. 3. ACROSS THE WIDER LANDSCAPE, BACKGROUND LEVELS OF MEAN DAILY ORANGUTAN CROP-RAIDING INCIDENTS PER MONTH (+/- SE) FARMS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER BETWEEN THE PRE-TRIAL (9.1 +/- 3.7) AND TRIAL (7.1 +/- 4.3) PHASES, WHILST ON THE 35 TREATMENT FARMS IT REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY. FURTHERMORE, CROP YIELD INCREASED (+ 60 8\%) ON THE NETTED TRIAL TREES, BUT REDUCED (-27.4\%) ON THE CONTROL FARM TREES. DESPITE THIS, THERE WAS NO SUBSEQUENT USE OF THIS TECHNIQUE, UNLIKE THOSE FARMERS (40\%) WHO CONTINUED USING THE LESS-EFFECTIVE NOISE DETERRENTS. 4. FARMER PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT YIELDED UNEXPECTED AND POSITIVE ATTITUDE CHANGES, FROM PREFERRING ORANGUTAN REMOVAL (PRE-TRIAL) TO IN SITU MANAGEMENT WITH CROP PROTECTION MEASURES (POSTTRIAL). HOWEVER, PROJECT PARTICIPATION MAY HAVE INCREASED FARMER EXPECTATIONS OF RECEIVING COMPENSATION BECAUSE THE TREATMENT FARMERS CONSISTENTLY OVERESTIMATED THEIR CROP LOSSES, UNLIKE THE CONTROL FARMERS WHO DID NOT. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. WHILST HUMAN-ORANGUTAN CONFLICTS CAUSED SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES TO LOCAL LIVELIHOODS, THE IDENTIFICATION OF AN EFFECTIVE MITIGATION METHOD (NETS) NEITHER GUARANTEED ITS CONTINUED USE NOR UPTAKE. DEVELOPING EASY TO INSTALL NETS FOR VALUABLE TREE CROPS IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED. NEVERTHELESS, THE PROJECT INTERVENTION EFFORTS DID CREATE BENIGN FARMER ATTITUDES TOWARDS ORANGUTAN MANAGEMENT, AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE FOR MANAGING LARGE-BODIED MAMMALS IN CONFLICT WITH PEOPLE.",2

ALTHOUGH SOME PRIMATE SPECIES USE PLANTED FORESTS, FEW STUDIES HAVE COMPARED PRIMATE POPULATIONS IN NATURAL AND NEARBY PLANTED FORESTS. FROM MARCH 2006 TO JULY 2010, WE CONDUCTED LINE TRANSECT SURVEYS AND ASSESSED GROUP SIZES AND COMPOSITIONS IN NATURAL AND NEARBY 60-70 YEAR OLD MIXED INDIGENOUS PLANTED FOREST TO DETERMINE THE DENSITIES OF DIURNAL PRIMATE SPECIES (COLOBUS GUEREZA, CERCOPITHECUS MITIS, C. ASCANIUS) IN THESE TWO FOREST TYPES AT ISECHENO, KAKAMEGA FOREST, KENYA. LINE TRANSECT DATA WERE ANALYZED USING THE ENCOUNTER RATE, WHITESIDES, AND DISTANCE SAMPLING METHODS, WHICH ALL PROVIDED BROADLY CONSISTENT RESULTS. WE FOUND THAT ALL THREE DIURNAL PRIMATE SPECIES OCCUPY BOTH NATURAL AND PLANTED FOREST AT ISECHENO. HOWEVER, GROUP DENSITIES OF THE TWO CERCOPITHECUS SPECIES WERE 42-46% LOWER IN PLANTED THAN IN NATURAL FOREST. COLOBUS GUEREZA ACHIEVED COMPARABLE GROUP DENSITIES IN THE TWO FOREST TYPES, ALTHOUGH THE SPECIES IS FOUND IN SMALLER GROUPS, AND THUS AT LOWER (35%) INDIVIDUAL DENSITY, IN PLANTED THAN IN NATURAL FOREST. FOLLOWING A LOGGING EPISODE IN THE PLANTED FOREST MID-WAY THROUGH OUR STUDY, CERCOPITHECUS ASCANIUS GROUP DENSITIES FELL BY 60% WHILE C. MITIS AND COLOBUS GUEREZA GROUP DENSITIES REMAINED STABLE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WHILE PRIMATE SPECIES VARY IN THEIR RESPONSE TO HABITAT DISTURBANCE, PLANTED FOREST HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONSERVATION OF SOME AFRICAN MONKEY SPECIES. EVEN FOR THE RELATIVELY FLEXIBLE TAXA IN OUR STUDY, HOWEVER, 60-70 YEAR OLD MIXED INDIGENOUS PLANTED FOREST FAILED TO SUPPORT DENSITIES COMPARABLE TO THOSE IN NEARBY NATURAL FOREST.

IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE FOCUSED ON BLACK HOWLER MONKEYS (ALOUATTA PIGRA), A CANOPY-DWELLING PRIMATE SPECIES, AS A CASE STUDY TO EVALUATE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF LIVING IN UNPROTECTED AREAS, AND RELATE THEM WITH INTRAGROUP COMPETITION AND COMPETITION WITH EXTRAGROUP INDIVIDUALS. FROM FEBRUARY 2006 TO SEPTEMBER 2007 WE COLLECTED 371 FECAL SAMPLES FROM 21 ADULTS BELONGING TO FIVE GROUPS (TWO FROM PROTECTED AND THREE FROM UNPROTECTED AREAS) IN CAMPECHE, MEXICO. WE RECORDED AGONISTIC INTERACTIONS WITHIN GROUPS AND ENCOUNTERS WITH OTHER GROUPS (1,200 H OF BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS), AND DETERMINED FECAL GLUCOCORTICOID METABOLITE (FGM) CONCENTRATIONS WITH RADIOIMMUNOASSAYS. WE USED LINEAR MIXED MODELS AND AKAIKE'S INFORMATION CRITERION TO CHOOSE THE BEST MODEL EXPLAINING VARIATION IN FGM CONCENTRATIONS BETWEEN PROTECTED AND UNPROTECTED AREAS CALCULATED FROM FIVE CATEGORICAL VARIABLES: HABITAT TYPE (PROTECTED VS.

THE BEST MODEL INCLUDED HABITAT TYPE, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN HABITAT TYPE AND AGONISM, AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN HABITAT TYPE AND SEASON. FGM CONCENTRATIONS WERE HIGHER IN UNPROTECTED HABITATS, PARTICULARLY WHEN INDIVIDUALS WERE INVOLVED IN AGONISTIC INTERACTIONS; SEASONAL VARIATION IN FGM CONCENTRATIONS WAS ONLY DETECTED IN PROTECTED HABITATS. HIGH FGM CONCENTRATIONS IN BLACK HOWLER MONKEYS LIVING IN UNPROTECTED HABITATS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED WITHIN-GROUP FOOD COMPETITION AND PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO ANTHROPOGENIC STRESSORS AND OVERALL FOOD SCARCITY.

PRIOR TO REINTRODUCTION, THE ABILITY OF THE ORPHANS TO SURVIVE INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED. HERE, WE PERFORMED A MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, INCLUDING DIET COMPOSITION, ACTIVITY-BUDGET, AND PATTERN OF STRATA USING OF A GROUP OF FIVE JUVENILE WLG IN THE PROCESS OF REHABILITATION AND DISTINGUISHED THREE SUB-PERIODS OF ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: THE HIGH FURGIVORY PERIOD, THE DIALIUM FRUITS CONSUMPTION PERIOD, AND THE HIGH FOLIVORY PERIOD. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE VARIATIONS ON THEIR WELL-BEING (PLAY BEHAVIOUR) AND THE GROUP COHESION (SPATIAL PROXIMITY AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS) WERE EXAMINED. LIKE WILD WLGS, DIETS SHIFTED SEASONALLY FROM FRUGIVOROUS TO FOLIVOROUS, WHILE THE SAME STAPLE FOODS WERE CONSUMED AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF DIALIUM FRUITS WERE SEASONALLY GATHERED HIGH IN TREES. WHEN SUCCULENT FRUIT INTAKE WAS THE HIGHEST, THUS PROVIDING HIGH ENERGY FROM SUGAR, JUVENILES SPENT LESS TIME FEEDING, MORE TIME PLAYING AND GROUP COHESION WAS THE HIGHEST.

IN ENGLAND, THIS OBLIGATION HAS RESULTED IN LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS FOR DEROGATION FROM STRICT PROTECTION UNDER LICENSE, PROVIDED ACTIVITIES ARE UNDERTAKEN TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON BAT NUMBERS. WE USED AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH TO ASSESS THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND THE ENGLISH BAT-DEROGATION LICENSING PROCESS AS A WHOLE. WE ANALYZED DATA FROM 389 BAT DEROGATION LICENSES ISSUED IN ENGLAND FROM 2003 TO 2005 RELATING TO 1776 ROOSTS AND 15 SPECIES TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF DEVELOPMENT AND MITIGATION ACTIVITIES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON BATS. OVERALL THE EFFECTS OF LICENSED ACTIVITIES ON ROOSTS WERE NEGATIVE. DESPITE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION AFFORDED TO BATS, THE MAJORITY (68\%) OF ROOSTS FOR WHICH DEROGATION LICENSES WERE ISSUED WERE DESTROYED. THERE WERE SPECIES-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN THE PROBABILITY OF ROOSTS BEING DESTROYED, AND IMPACTS ON ROOSTS DID NOT REFLECT A SPECIES' CONSERVATION STATUS. INFORMATION PROVIDED BY LICENSEES WAS INADEQUATE AND INCONSISTENT. MOST LICENSEES (67\%) FAILED TO SUBMIT POSTDEVELOPMENT REPORTS, AND POSTDEVELOPMENT MONITORING WAS CONDUCTED AT ONLY 19\% OF SITES.

GREEN ROOFS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN HIGHLY URBANIZED AREAS SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY (NYC), WHICH HAS MORE ROOFTOPS (34\%) THAN GREEN SPACE (13\%). TO DATE, NO STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EXTENT TO WHICH NORTH AMERICAN BATS UTILIZE URBAN GREEN ROOFS. TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF GREEN ROOFS IN SUPPORTING URBAN BATS, WE MONITORED BAT ACTIVITY USING ULTRASONIC RECORDERS ON FOUR GREEN AND FOUR CONVENTIONAL ROOFS LOCATED IN HIGHLY DEVELOPED AREAS OF NYC, WHICH WERE PAIRED TO CONTROL FOR LOCATION, HEIGHT, AND LOCAL VARIABILITY IN SURROUNDING HABITAT AND SPECIES DIVERSITY. WE THEN IDENTIFIED BAT VOCALIZATIONS ON THESE RECORDINGS TO THE SPECIES LEVEL. WE DOCUMENTED THE PRESENCE OF FIVE OF NINE POSSIBLE BAT SPECIES OVER BOTH ROOF TYPES: LASIURUS BOREALIS, L. CINEREUS, L. NOCTIVAGANS, P. SUBFLAVUS, AND E. FUSCUS. OF THE BAT CALLS THAT COULD BE IDENTIFIED TO THE SPECIES LEVEL, 66\% WERE FROM L. BOREALIS. OVERALL LEVELS OF BAT ACTIVITY WERE HIGHER OVER GREEN ROOFS THAN OVER CONVENTIONAL ROOFS.

MOST INSECTS (96%) CAPTURED IN LIGHT TRAPS WERE COLEOPTERA, DIPTERA, HEMIPTERA, LEPIDOPTERA, AND TRICHOPTERA; FECAL ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT COLEOPTERA DOMINATED THE DIET OF BIG BROWN BATS (79% BY VOLUME), FOLLOWED BY DIPTERA (14%). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL ORCHARDS IN NUMBER OF INSECTS CAPTURED WITH LIGHT TRAPS, BATS CAPTURED WITH MIST NETS, ACOUSTIC RECORDINGS OF BATS, OR PROPORTION OF COLEOPTERA AND DIPTERA CONSUMED BY THE BATS. HOWEVER, THE TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION OF CAPTURED INSECTS AND ACOUSTIC RECORDINGS WAS NOT HOMOGENOUS AMONG ORCHARDS IN EITHER GROUP, SUGGESTING THAT FACTORS OTHER THAN FARMING PRACTICES WERE MORE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING WHICH INSECTS AND BATS WERE FOUND IN THE SMALL ORCHARDS TYPICAL OF SOUTHERN MICHIGAN.",1

DESPITE THE MEDITERRANEAN BASIN BEING A BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT FOR CONSERVATION PRIORITIES, THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF ORGANIC FARMING FOR BIODIVERSITY THERE HAS RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION. HERE, WE ASSESSED THE EFFECT OF FARMING SYSTEM, LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS AND HABITAT STRUCTURE ON BIODIVERSITY IN MEDITERRANEAN VINEYARDS USING TWO TAXA WITH DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL TRAITS (IN TERMS OF MOBILITY, DISPERSAL ABILITY AND HOME RANGE SIZE): BATS AND ARACHNIDS.

OUR STUDY DESIGN INVOLVED PAIRS OF MATCHED ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL VINEYARD PLOTS IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE SITUATED ALONG A LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY GRADIENT. ABUNDANCE OF ARACHNIDS WERE HIGHER IN ORGANIC VINEYARDS, ALTHOUGH ARACHNID SPECIES RICHNESS WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE AMOUNT OF GROUND VEGETATION COVER. ORGANIC FARMING WAS INEFFECTIVE ON ITS OWN TO ENHANCE BAT ACTIVITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS REGARDLESS OF THE LANDSCAPE CONTEXT. RATHER, OUR RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT LANDSCAPE FEATURES WERE MORE IMPORTANT FOR BATS THAN VINEYARD MANAGEMENT, WITH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BAT ACTIVITY RECORDED ON VINEYARD PLOTS LOCATED AT CLOSE PROXIMITY TO HEDGEROWS AND RIVERS. WHEN DESIGNING CONSERVATION STRATEGIES IN MEDITERRANEAN FARMLANDS, WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A MULTI-SCALE APPROACH TO ASSURE BENEFITS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF SPECIES.",1

AIMS WE INVESTIGATED THE USE OF YOUNG (4–11 YEARS OLD) TIMBER PLANTATIONS BY BATS IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER VEGETATION CLASSES IN A HIGHLY CLEARED AND PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE IN NORTH-WEST NEW SOUTH WALES (NSW), AUSTRALIA. METHODS INITIALLY, WE RECORDED ACTIVITY IN PADDOCKS BEFORE PLANTATION ESTABLISHMENT, AND THEN FOUR TO SIX YEARS AFTER ESTABLISHMENT. WE COMPARED ACTIVITY WITHIN YOUNG EUCALYPT PLANTATIONS WITH SURROUNDING PADDOCKS AND REMNANT WOODLAND. WE ALSO RADIO-TRACKED FOUR DIFFERENT BAT SPECIES TO INVESTIGATE HOW ROOSTING AND FORAGING WAS APPORTIONED INTO DIFFERENT HABITATS. KEY RESULTS THE ULTRASONIC SURVEY OF BATS FOUND THAT THE YOUNG PLANTATIONS WERE TYPICALLY USED BY 7–8 SPECIES AND ACTIVITY AVERAGED 87 PASSES PER NIGHT. ACTIVITY WITHIN PLANTATIONS WAS SIMILAR TO TREELESS PADDOCKS, AND APPROXIMATELY SIX TIMES LESS THAN IN SMALL REMNANTS. THE VERY HIGH ACTIVITY LEVELS AND FEEDING BUZZES IN SMALL REMNANTS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO RICH, BASALT SOIL (WHICH WAS USED AS A PROXY FOR INVERTEBRATE BIOMASS) ON AGRICULTURAL PLAINS. TOTAL ACTIVITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS WAS CORRELATED POSITIVELY WITH THE NUMBER OF REMNANT TREES ON THE SITE, BUT NEITHER PLANTATION AREA NOR SHAPE INFLUENCED BAT ACTIVITY. PLANTATIONS WERE NOT USED PREFERENTIALLY BY RADIO-TRACKED BATS AT NIGHT COMPARED WITH THEIR AVAILABILITY IN THE LOCAL LANDSCAPE (13–14% BAT USE, 17% AVAILABLE). NO BAT ROOSTS WERE LOCATED WITHIN THE PLANTATIONS. MOST BAT ROOSTS WERE IN TREE HOLLOWS, WHICH WERE ABSENT IN THE PLANTATIONS. DECORTICATING BARK WAS ABUNDANT IN EUCALYPT PLANTATIONS, BUT ONLY NYCTOPHILUS GEOFFROYI WAS OBSERVED BENEATH BARK AND ONLY IN REMNANT TREES OUTSIDE OF PLANTATIONS. CONCLUSIONS YOUNG EUCALYPT PLANTATIONS HAVE LIMITED VALUE FOR BATS, AND THIS IS COMPARABLE TO PREVIOUS STUDIES ON MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FOCUSSED PLANTINGS. IMPLICATIONS THE VALUE OF PLANTATIONS FOR BATS WOULD BE IMPROVED BY RETAINING REMNANT TREES, BOTH IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE AND WITHIN PLANTATIONS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND VARYING TREE DENSITIES TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF ANIMAL SPECIES USING PLANTATIONS.",1

WE IMPLEMENTED A 2-YEAR STUDY TESTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN ULTRASONIC ACOUSTIC DETERRENT FOR REDUCING BAT FATALITIES AT A WIND ENERGY FACILITY IN PENNSYLVANIA. WE RANDOMLY SELECTED CONTROL AND TREATMENT TURBINES THAT WERE SEARCHED DAILY IN SUMMER AND FALL 2009 AND 2010. ESTIMATES OF FATALITY, CORRECTED FOR FIELD BIASES, WERE COMPARED BETWEEN TREATMENT AND CONTROL TURBINES.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THESE INVASIVE PREDATORS ON BATS (CHIROPTERA), ONE OF THE MOST SPECIOUS MAMMAL GROUPS, AND ONE OF THE MOST WIDESPREAD GROUPS OF MAMMALS THREATENED ON OCEANIC ISLANDS (> 200 SPP.). NEARLY 50\% OF THE WORLD'S THREATENED BATS ARE ISLAND ENDEMICS AND BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN THE ONLY NATIVE MAMMALS ON ISLANDS, THEY FULFIL IMPORTANT ECOLOGICAL ROLES SUCH AS POLLINATION AND SEED DISPERSAL. LONG-TAILED BATS (CHALINOLOBUS TUBERCULATUS) ARE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED BECAUSE OF PREDATION BY EXOTIC MAMMALS, PARTICULARLY SHIP RATS (RATTUS RATIOS), INTRODUCED BY HUMANS TO THE ISLAND ARCHIPELAGO OF NEW ZEALAND. WE MONITORED THE SURVIVAL OF BATS IN THREE COLONIES IN TEMPERATE RAINFOREST IN FIORDLAND OVER 22 YEARS. SINCE 2009, WE CONTROLLED PREDATORS DURING IRRUPTION PHASES AND COMPARED SURVIVAL OF BATS IN PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED AREAS WITH SURVIVAL IN FOREST BLOCKS TREATED USING RODENTICIDES DEPLOYED IN BAIT STATIONS. SURVIVAL WAS ESTIMATED USING MULTI-STATE MARK-RECAPTURE MODELS IN PROGRAM MARK 7.0 WITH > 15,000 BATS TAGGED. SURVIVAL WAS PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON YEAR AND AGE OF BATS, ALTHOUGH SEEDFALL INTENSITY OF THE DOMINANT CANOPY TREE AND PREDATOR MANAGEMENT WAS ALSO INFLUENTIAL. SURVIVAL IN LONG-TAILED BATS WAS AS HIGH AS, OR HIGHER, THAN FIGURES FOR BATS GENERALLY IN YEARS WITH LOW PREDATOR NUMBERS OR PREDATOR CONTROL. SURVIVAL WAS MARKEDLY HIGHER IN TREATMENT YEARS WHEN PREDATORS WERE MANAGED (0.82 COMPARED TO 0.55). POPULATION MODELLING INDICATED MANAGED COLONIES WILL INCREASE (LAMBDA > 1.05) WHEREAS UNMANAGED COLONIES WILL DECLINE (LAMBDA = 0.89 - 0.98) UNDER SCENARIOS THAT REFLECT INCREASED FREQUENCY OF BEECH MAST AND PREDATOR IRRUPTIONS. THUS, EFFECTIVE PREDATOR CONTROL IS ESSENTIAL FOR RECOVERING LONG-TAILED BAT POPULATIONS. WARMING TEMPERATURES INDICATE THAT PREDATOR IRRUPTIONS ARE BECOMING MORE FREQUENT, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE MORE PREDATOR CONTROL IN THE FUTURE THAN AT PRESENT IF DECLINES IN BAT POPULATIONS ARE TO BE REVERSED.

OVERALL, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN ACTIVITY BETWEEN PART- AND FULL-NIGHT LIGHTING SITES WERE OBSERVED IN 5 OF THE 8 SPECIES STUDIED, SUGGESTING THAT CURRENT PART-NIGHT LIGHTING SCHEMES FAIL TO ENCOMPASS THE RANGE OF ACTIVITY OF MOST BAT SPECIES. WE RECOMMEND THAT SUCH SCHEMES START EARLIER AT NIGHT TO EFFECTIVELY MITIGATE THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING ON LIGHT-SENSITIVE SPECIES, PARTICULARLY ALONG ECOLOGICAL CORRIDORS THAT ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PERSISTENCE OF BIODIVERSITY IN URBAN LANDSCAPES.",1

AMONG THESE, BATS ARE STRONGLY AFFECTED, AND HOW BAT SPECIES REACT TO LIGHT IS LIKELY TO VARY WITH LIGHT COLOUR. DIFFERENT SPECTRA MAY THEREFORE BE APPLIED TO REDUCE NEGATIVE IMPACTS. WE USED A UNIQUE SET-UP OF EIGHT FIELD SITES TO STUDY THE RESPONSE OF BATS TO THREE DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTAL LIGHT SPECTRA IN AN OTHERWISE DARK AND UNDISTURBED NATURAL HABITAT. WE MEASURED ACTIVITY OF THREE BAT SPECIES GROUPS AROUND TRANSECTS WITH LIGHT POSTS EMITTING WHITE, GREEN AND RED LIGHT WITH AN INTENSITY COMMONLY USED TO ILLUMINATE COUNTRYSIDE ROADS. THE RESULTS REVEAL A STRONG AND SPECTRUM-DEPENDENT RESPONSE FOR THE SLOW-FLYING <I>MYOTIS</I> AND <I>PLECOTUS</I> AND MORE AGILE <I>PIPISTRELLUS</I> SPECIES, BUT NOT FOR <I>NYCTALUS</I> AND <I>EPTESICUS</I> SPECIES. <I>PLECOTUS</I> AND <I>MYOTIS</I> SPECIES AVOIDED WHITE AND GREEN LIGHT, BUT WERE EQUALLY ABUNDANT IN RED LIGHT AND DARKNESS.

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, BATS AND THEIR ROOSTS ARE PROTECTED BY LAW, AND STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN CONSERVING THE NATURAL AND CULTURAL HERITAGE CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. WE INVESTIGATED MITIGATION STRATEGIES THAT COULD BE EMPLOYED IN CHURCHES AND OTHER HISTORIC BUILDINGS TO ALLEVIATE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY BATS WITHOUT ADVERSELY AFFECTING THEIR WELFARE OR CONSERVATION STATUS. WE USED A COMBINATION OF ARTIFICIAL ROOST PROVISION AND DETERRENCE AT CHURCHES IN NORFOLK, ENGLAND, WHERE SIGNIFICANT MATERNITY COLONIES OF NATTERER'S BATS MYOTIS NATTERERI DAMAGE CHURCH FEATURES. RADIO-TRACKING DATA AND POPULATION MODELLING SHOWED THAT EXCLUDING M.

WE SHOW THAT DETERRENCE CAN BE USED TO MOVE BATS HUMANELY FROM SPECIFIC ROOSTING SITES WITHIN A CHURCH AND LIMIT THE SPREAD OF DROPPINGS AND URINE SO THAT PROBLEMS TO CONGREGATIONS AND DAMAGE TO CULTURAL HERITAGE CAN BE MUCH REDUCED. IN ADDITION, CONSTRUCTION OF BESPOKE ROOST SPACES WITHIN CHURCHES CAN ALLOW BATS TO CONTINUE TO ROOST WITHIN THE FABRIC OF THE BUILDING WITHOUT FLYING IN THE CHURCH INTERIOR.

USING 64 RECORDING SITES (OT&#XA0;=&#XA0;12; T&#XA0;=&#XA0;21; CT&#XA0;=&#XA0;13; CTH&#XA0;=&#XA0;18), WE SAMPLED SEVERAL SITES PER SYSTEM PLACED INSIDE THE FIELDS EACH NIGHT. WE SHOWED THAT BAT ACTIVITY WAS ALWAYS HIGHER IN OT THAN IN T SYSTEMS FOR TWO (<I>PIPISTRELLUS KUHLII</I> AND <I>PIPISTRELLUS PIPISTRELLUS</I>) OF THREE SPECIES AND FOR ONE (<I>PIPISTRELLUS</I> SPP.) OF TWO GENERA, AS WELL AS GREATER SPECIES RICHNESS. THE SAME RESULTS WERE FOUND FOR THE CT VERSUS T SYSTEM COMPARISON. CTH SYSTEM SHOWED HIGHER ACTIVITY THAN T FOR ONLY ONE GENUS (<I>PIPISTRELLUS</I> SPP.). WE DID NOT DETECT ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OT AND CT SYSTEMS, AND CT SHOWED HIGHER ACTIVITY THAN CTH SYSTEM FOR ONLY ONE SPECIES (<I>PIPISTRELLUS KUHLII</I>). ACTIVITY IN OT OF <I>PIPISTRELLUS</I> SPP. WAS OVERALL 3.6 AND 9.3 TIMES HIGHER THAN CTH AND T SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, AND 6.9 TIMES HIGHER IN CT THAN T SYSTEMS. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT AN IMPORTANT BENEFIT OF ORGANIC FARMING AND CONTRASTED EFFECTS IN CONVENTIONAL FARMING. THAT THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES DETECTED BETWEEN THE ORGANIC AND ONE CONVENTIONAL SYSTEM IS A MAJOR RESULT. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT EVEN IF ORGANIC FARMING IS PRESENTLY DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT AND REQUIRES A CHANGE OF ECONOMIC CONTEXT FOR FARMERS, CONSIDERABLE AND EASY IMPROVEMENTS IN CONVENTIONAL FARMING ARE ATTAINABLE, WHILE MAINTAINING YIELDS AND APPROACHING THE ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF ORGANIC METHODS.",1

AIMS TO ESTABLISH A BEFORE-AFTER-CONTROL-IMPACT EXPERIMENT TO ASSESS RESPONSES OF FOREST STRUCTURE AND FAUNA TO LARGE-SCALE (COMPARTMENT-LEVEL; ~440 HA) SILVICULTURAL THINNING. METHODS WE MEASURED IMMEDIATE (<2 YRS) RESPONSES OF FOREST STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS (LIVING, DEAD AND HOLLOW-BEARING STEM DENSITIES, COARSE WOODY DEBRIS (CWD) DENSITY AND VOLUMES AND GROUND COVER) AND COMPONENTS OF BIODIVERSITY (BATS, BIRDS, VOLANT INSECTS AND NON-VOLANT MAMMALS) BEFORE AND AFTER THINNING WITHIN FIVE CONTROL AND THREE IMPACT COMPARTMENTS. KEY RESULTS THINNING REDUCED STEM DENSITY BY APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN ACTIVITY AND RICHNESS OF BATS AND A CHANGE IN BAT SPECIES COMPOSITION. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN RICHNESS FOR BIRDS AND NON-VOLANT MAMMALS, NOR INSECT BIOMASS IN RELATION TO THINNING.

WE INVESTIGATED FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW DIFFERENTLY GRAINED FOREST MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AFFECT THE BIODIVERSITY OF MULTIPLE ABOVE- AND BELOW-GROUND TAXA ACROSS SPATIAL SCALES. 2.

TO EVALUATE MICROHABITAT DIFFERENCES IN COMMON ARTIFICIAL ROOST STRUCTURES AND DETERMINE IF ROOST SELECTION OCCURS BASED ON STRUCTURE TYPE, WE INSTALLED ARTIFICIAL ROOSTS OF THREE DIFFERENT STYLES (BAT BOX, ROCKET BOX, AND BARK MIMIC) IN SIX CLUSTERS.

TWO INTERRELATED AND MORE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS GO UNANSWERED: HAVE THE MAJOR BREEDING PROGRAMS SUCCEEDED AT THE BASIC LEVEL OF MAINTAINING AND EXPANDING POPULATIONS, AND IS THERE ROOM TO EXPAND THEM? I USED PUBLISHED COUNTS OF BIRTHS AND DEATHS FROM 1970 TO 2011 TO QUANTIFY RATES OF GROWTH OF 118 CAPTIVE-BRED MAMMALIAN POPULATIONS. THESE RATES DID NOT VARY WITH BODY MASS, CONTRARY TO STRONG PREDICTIONS MADE IN THE ECOLOGICAL LITERATURE. MOST OF THE LARGER MANAGED MAMMALIAN POPULATIONS EXPANDED CONSISTENTLY AND VERY FEW PROGRAMS FAILED. HOWEVER, GROWTH RATES HAVE DECLINED DRAMATICALLY. THE DECLINE WAS PREDICTED BY CHANGES IN THE RATIO OF THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN PROGRAMS TO THE NUMBER OF MAMMAL POPULATIONS HELD IN MAJOR ZOOS. RATES DECREASED AS THE RATIO OF INDIVIDUALS IN PROGRAMS TO POPULATIONS INCREASED. IN OTHER WORDS, MOST OF THE PROGRAMS THAT COULD EXIST ALREADY DO EXIST. IT THEREFORE APPEARS THAT DEBATES OVER THE GENERAL NEED FOR CAPTIVE-BREEDING PROGRAMS AND THE BEST SELECTION OF SPECIES ARE MOOT. ONLY A CONCERTED EFFORT COULD CREATE ROOM TO MANAGE A SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER NUMBER OF ENDANGERED MAMMALS. LOS LIMITES PARA LA REPRODUCCION EN CAUTIVERIO DE MAMIFEROS EN ZOOLOGICOS ALROY RESUMEN LA REPRODUCCION EN CAUTIVERIO DE MAMIFEROS EN ZOOLOGICOS ES LA ULTIMA ESPERANZA PARA MUCHAS DE LAS ESPECIES EN PELIGRO MEJOR CONOCIDAS Y HA SIDO EXITOSA EN EL RESCATE DE LA EXTINCION SEGURA DE ALGUNAS ESPECIES. SIN EMBARGO, EL NUMERO DE ESPECIES SELECCIONADAS PARA EL MANEJO ES RELATIVAMENTE PEQUENO Y ESTA ENFOCADO EN MAMIFEROS GRANDES Y CARISMATICOS QUE NO ESTAN NECESARIAMENTE BAJO UNA FUERTE AMENAZA DE EXTINCION Y QUE NO SIEMPRE SON BUENOS CANDIDATOS PARA LA REINTRODUCCION A LA VIDA SILVESTRE. DOS PREGUNTAS INTERCONECTADAS Y MAS FUNDAMENTALES SIGUEN SIN RESPUESTA: HAN TENIDO EXITO LA MAYORIA DE LOS PROGRAMAS DE REPRODUCCION EN EL NIVEL BASICO DE MANTENER Y EXPANDIR POBLACIONES Y HAY ESPACIO PARA EXPANDIRLAS? USE CONTEOS PUBLICADOS DE NACIMIENTOS Y MUERTES DESDE 1970 HASTA 2011 PARA CUANTIFICAR LAS TASAS DE CRECIMIENTO DE 118 POBLACIONES DE MAMIFEROS REPRODUCIDOS EN CAUTIVERIO. ESTAS TASAS NO VARIARON CON LA MASA CORPORAL, CONTRADICIENDO LAS FUERTES PREDICCIONES HECHAS EN LA LITERATURA ECOLOGICA. LA MAYORIA DE LAS POBLACIONES DE MAMIFEROS CON MAYOR MANEJO SE EXPANDIO CONSISTENTEMENTE Y MUY POCOS PROGRAMAS FALLARON. SIN EMBARGO, LAS TASAS DE CRECIMIENTO DECLINARON DRAMATICAMENTE. LA DECLINACION FUE PREDICHA POR LOS CAMBIOS EN LA PROPORCION DEL NUMERO DE INDIVIDUOS DENTRO DE LOS PROGRAMAS AL NUMERO DE ESPECIES DE MAMIFEROS DENTRO DE LA MAYORIA DE LOS ZOOLOGICOS. LAS TASAS DISMINUYERON CONFORME A LA PROPORCION DE INDIVIDUOS EN LOS PROGRAMAS A LA DE INDIVIDUOS EN LAS POBLACIONES. EN OTRAS PALABRAS, LA MAYORIA DE LOS PROGRAMAS QUE PODRIAN EXISTIR YA EXISTEN. POR ESTO PARECE QUE LOS DEBATES SOBRE LA NECESIDAD GENERAL DE PROGRAMAS DE REPRODUCCION EN CAUTIVERIO Y UNA MEJOR SELECCION DE ESPECIES SON IRRELEVANTES. SOLAMENTE UN ESFUERZO COORDINADO PODRIA CREAR EL ESPACIO PARA MANEJAR UN NUMERO SUSTANCIALMENTE MAYOR DE MAMIFEROS EN PELIGRO.",1

CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH EFFORTS ARE DEVOTED TO RESOLVING THE MECHANISMS BEHIND THESE THREATS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A BASIS FOR RELEVANT CONSERVATION ACTIONS. HOWEVER, EVEN WHEN THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS ARE KNOWN, SPECIFIC ACTIONS AIMED AT DIRECT SUPPORT FOR CARNIVORES ARE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE AT EFFICIENT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. WE REPORT ON A 30-YEAR INVENTORY OF THE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED FENNOSCANDIAN ARCTIC FOX VULPES LAGOPUS L., INCLUDING YEARLY SURVEYS OF 600 FOX DENS COVERING 21000KM2. THESE SURVEYS SHOWED THAT THE POPULATION WAS CLOSE TO EXTINCTION IN 2000, WITH 4060 ADULT ANIMALS LEFT. HOWEVER, THE POPULATION SUBSEQUENTLY SHOWED A FOURFOLD INCREASE IN SIZE. DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, CONSERVATION ACTIONS THROUGH SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING AND PREDATOR REMOVAL WERE IMPLEMENTED IN SEVERAL REGIONS ACROSS SCANDINAVIA, ENCOMPASSING 79\% OF THE AREA. TO EVALUATE THESE ACTIONS, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENTAL WINTER FEEDING AND RED FOX CONTROL APPLIED AT DIFFERENT INTENSITIES IN 10 REGIONS. A PATH ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT 47\% OF THE EXPLAINED VARIATION IN POPULATION PRODUCTIVITY COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO LEMMING ABUNDANCE, WHEREAS WINTER FEEDING HAD A 29\% EFFECT AND RED FOX CONTROL A 20\% EFFECT. THIS CONFIRMS THAT ARCTIC FOXES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON LEMMING POPULATION FLUCTUATIONS BUT ALSO SHOWS THAT RED FOXES SEVERELY IMPACT THE VIABILITY OF ARCTIC FOXES. THIS STUDY ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPLEMENTING CONSERVATION ACTIONS ON EXTENSIVE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES, WITH GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED ACTIONS TO SCIENTIFICALLY EVALUATE THE EFFECTS. WE NOTE THAT POPULATION RECOVERY WAS ONLY SEEN IN REGIONS WITH A HIGH INTENSITY OF MANAGEMENT ACTIONS. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THE PRESENT STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT CARNIVORE POPULATION DECLINES MAY BE REVERSED THROUGH EXTENSIVE ACTIONS THAT TARGET SPECIFIC THREATS. FENNOSCANDIAN ARCTIC FOX IS STILL ENDANGERED, DUE TO LOW POPULATION CONNECTIVITY AND EXPECTED CLIMATE IMPACTS ON THE DISTRIBUTION AND DYNAMICS OF LEMMINGS AND RED FOXES. CLIMATE WARMING IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO BOTH MORE IRREGULAR LEMMING DYNAMICS AND RED FOX APPEARANCE IN TUNDRA AREAS; HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE CAN BE MITIGATED THROUGH INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS SUCH AS SUPPLEMENTAL FEEDING AND RED FOX CONTROL.",2

IN THE YEAR STARTING IN FEBRUARY OF 2001, 29 LEOPARDS WERE CAPTURED IN THE HUMAN-DOMINATED RURAL LANDSCAPE OF THE JUNNAR REGION (4275 KM(2) , 185 PEOPLE/KM(2) ), MAHARASHTRA, INDIA, AND RELEASED AN AVERAGE OF 39.5 KM AWAY IN ADJOINING FORESTS. ELEVEN LEOPARDS WERE ALSO RELOCATED TO THE SAME FORESTS FROM OTHER DISTRICTS. PRIOR TO THE LARGE-SCALE TRANSLOCATION PROGRAM, AN AVERAGE OF FOUR LEOPARD ATTACKS ON HUMANS OCCURRED EACH YEAR BETWEEN 1993 AND 2001. AFTER THE TRANSLOCATION PROGRAM WAS INITIATED, THE AVERAGE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY TO 17 ATTACKS. LINEAR AND LOGISTIC MODELS SHOWED THAT ATTACK FREQUENCY INCREASED IN JUNNAR FOLLOWING NEARBY RELEASES OF LEOPARDS AND DECREASED WHEN LEOPARDS WERE REMOVED FOR RELEASES FAR AWAY; THAT ATTACKS BECAME MORE LETHAL WHEN THE NUMBER OF LEOPARDS INTRODUCED FROM OTHER DISTRICTS INCREASED; AND THAT ATTACKS WERE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE REGIONS WHERE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF LEOPARDS HAD BEEN INTRODUCED FROM OTHER AREAS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LEOPARDS DID NOT STAY AT THE RELEASE SITES AND THAT TRANSLOCATION INDUCED ATTACKS ON PEOPLE. POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS FOR THESE RESULTS INCLUDE INCREASED AGGRESSION INDUCED BY STRESS OF THE TRANSLOCATION PROCESS, MOVEMENT THROUGH UNFAMILIAR HUMAN-DOMINATED LANDSCAPES FOLLOWING RELEASE, AND LOSS OF FEAR OF HUMANS DUE TO FAMILIARITY WITH HUMANS ACQUIRED DURING CAPTIVITY. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT REACTIVE SOLUTIONS TO ATTACKS ON HUMANS BY LEOPARDS, SUCH AS TRANSLOCATION, COULD IN FACT INCREASE HUMAN-LEOPARD CONFLICT. MEASURES TO REDUCE HUMAN-CARNIVORE CONFLICTS MAY INCLUDE MORE EFFECTIVE COMPENSATION PROCEDURES TO PAY LIVESTOCK OWNERS FOR THE LOSS OF ANIMALS TO PREDATION BY CARNIVORES, PROVIDING BETTER METHODS OF PROTECTION FOR LIVESTOCK, AND ENCOURAGING GREATER SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRESENCE OF CARNIVORES IN HUMAN-DOMINATED LANDSCAPES.",1

CANIDS USE SCENT MARKING TO ESTABLISH TERRITORIES AND AVOID INTRASPECIFIC CONFLICT. EXPLOITING SCENT-MARKING BEHAVIOUR MAY PROVIDE A MEANS FOR MANIPULATING CANID MOVEMENTS. AIMS WE HYPOTHESISED THAT HUMAN-DEPLOYED SCENT MARKS (I.E. ‘BIOFENCE’) COULD BE USED TO MANIPULATE THE MOVEMENTS OF GREY WOLVES (CANIS LUPUS) IN IDAHO, USA. METHODS WE DEPLOYED 65 KM OF BIOFENCE WITHIN THREE WOLF-PACK TERRITORIES DURING SUMMER 2010 AND 2011 AND USED LOCATION DATA FROM SATELLITE-COLLARED WOLVES AND SIGN SURVEYS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BIOFENCING. KEY RESULTS LOCATION DATA PROVIDED BY SATELLITE-COLLARED WOLVES AND SIGN SURVEYS IN 2010 SHOWED LITTLE TO NO TRESPASS OF THE BIOFENCE, EVEN THOUGH THE EXCLUDED AREAS WERE USED BY THE PACKS IN PREVIOUS SUMMERS. WE ALSO OPPORTUNISTICALLY DEPLOYED A BIOFENCE IN BETWEEN A RENDEZVOUS SITE OF A RESIDENT PACK AND A NEARBY SHEEP GRAZING ALLOTMENT; THE PACK WAS NOT IMPLICATED IN ANY DEPREDATIONS IN SUMMER 2010, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD KILLED SHEEP EVERY YEAR SINCE 2006.

CONCLUSIONS BIOFENCING EFFECTIVELY MANIPULATED THE MOVEMENTS OF WOLVES IN THE FIRST YEAR OF OUR STUDY, BUT NOT THE SECOND. IMPLICATIONS OUR WORK SUGGESTS THAT BIOFENCING MAY BE MOST LIMITED BY THE APPARENT NECESSITY TO MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS PRESENCE ONCE THE BIOFENCE IS ESTABLISHED. THE INHERENT LABOUR AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH EFFORTS MAY LIMIT THE USEFULNESS OF BIOFENCING. OUR WORK CAN BE IMPROVED ON THROUGH FURTHER TESTING THAT MAINTAINS BIOFENCING OVER A LONGER TIMEFRAME (>3 MONTHS), SAMPLES SEVERAL ANIMALS PER TREATMENT PACK, AND USES A TREATMENT AND CONTROL DESIGN.",1

THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT PASSIVE FAUNAL RECOLONISATION OF RESTORED AREAS CAN TAKE DECADES OR EVEN CENTURIES, REDUCING BENEFITS TO BIODIVERSITY FROM RESTORATION. THUS, THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP RESTORATION AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT FACILITATE AND ACCELERATE FAUNAL RECOLONISATION. THIS REQUIRES IDENTIFICATION OF HABITAT FEATURES THAT ACT AS FILTERS TO SLOW OR PREVENT RECOLONISATION AND WHETHER THOSE FILTERS ARE TEMPORALLY UNIDIRECTIONAL OR DYNAMIC. 2. WE INVESTIGATED SUCCESSIONAL PATTERNS OF REPTILES AND MAMMALS IN RESTORED MINE-PITS IN SOUTH-WESTERN AUSTRALIA TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL FILTERS TO FAUNAL RECOLONISATION. WE SAMPLED REPTILES AND SMALL MAMMALS USING 30 TRAPPING GRIDS ACROSS EACH OF FOUR RESTORATION AGES (4, 8, 12 AND 17-YEARS OLD) AND UNMINED FOREST AND ASSESSED VEGETATION STRUCTURE TO IDENTIFY ANIMALHABITAT RELATIONSHIPS. 3. MAMMAL COMMUNITIES IN RESTORED AREAS CONVERGED ON UNMINED FOREST COMMUNITIES AS RESTORATION MATURED, AND ALL SPECIES RECOLONISED RAPIDLY, INDICATING THERE WERE NO FILTERS TO MAMMAL RECOLONISATION. IN CONTRAST, REPTILE COMMUNITIES DID NOT CONVERGE IN THE SAME WAY, INDICATING THERE WERE FILTERS THAT SLOWED OR PREVENTED REPTILE RECOLONISATION. WE IDENTIFIED THREE REPTILE SPECIES THAT WERE SLOW, OR FAILED, TO RECOLONISE RESTORED AREAS AND A FOURTH SPECIES THAT RAPIDLY RECOLONISED BUT DISAPPEARED AS RESTORATION MATURED. WE IDENTIFIED LOW COARSE WOODY DEBRIS (CWD) VOLUMES AND HIGH OVERSTOREY STEM DENSITIES AS LIKELY FILTERS; THE FORMER IS A UNIDIRECTIONAL FILTER THAT WILL DECREASE GRADUALLY OVER LONG TIME FRAMES, POSSIBLY CENTURIES, WHILE THE LATTER IS A DYNAMIC FILTER THAT FLUCTUATES IN ITS INTENSITY OVER SHORT TIME FRAMES OF YEARS. 4. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR STUDY ADDS TO GROWING EVIDENCE THAT FILTERS TO FAUNAL RECOLONISATION MAY BE WIDESPREAD IN RESTORED AREAS, WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR RESTORATION PRACTICES. FIRSTLY, EXAMINING INDIVIDUAL SPECIES MAY MORE EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY FILTERS THAN EXAMINING COMMUNITY SUCCESSIONAL PATTERNS. SECONDLY, FILTERS CAN PERSIST OVER LONG TIME FRAMES, POSSIBLY CENTURIES, SO MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS THE PROVISION AND ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT OF CWD, MAY NEED TO OCCUR OVER SIMILAR TIME FRAMES. LASTLY, FILTERS CAN BE DYNAMIC AND REPEATED MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS THINNING, MAY BE REQUIRED TO OVERCOME THESE FILTERS. THE GROWING EVIDENCE FOR FILTERS SUGGESTS THAT FACILITATING FAUNAL RECOLONISATION IS MORE COMPLEX THAN SIMPLY RETURNING VEGETATION TO RESTORATION SITES.",2

DEER MOUSE ABUNDANCE INCREASED MARKEDLY DURING AND AFTER CAT REMOVAL AND USE OF MICE BY FOXES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO MOUSE ABUNDANCE. THE INCREASE IN MICE AND SHIFT IN ITEM USE BY THE FOXES WAS CONSISTENT WITH A REDUCTION IN EXPLOITATIVE COMPETITION ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAT REMOVAL.

SOFT-RELEASE MEASURES, INCLUDING ACCLIMATISATION, HAVE BEEN USED FOR MANY SPECIES AROUND THE WORLD, BASED ON THE REASONING THAT GRADUAL AND SUPPORTED REINTRODUCTIONS SHOULD IMPROVE THE SUCCESS OF ANIMALS RELEASED INTO AN UNFAMILIAR WILD ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER, EXPERIMENTAL TESTING OF SOFT-RELEASE METHODS IS RARE. AIMS TO EXPERIMENTALLY TEST THE EFFECT OF A SOFT-RELEASE METHOD VERSUS A HARD-RELEASE METHOD ON THE INITIAL REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS OF THE EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOT (PERAMELES GUNNII). METHODS WE RELEASED 12 CAPTIVE-BRED EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOTS INTO A PREDATOR-PROOF RESERVE USING TWO METHODS: SOFT-RELEASE (7 DAYS OF ON-SITE ACCLIMATISATION WITH SUPPLEMENTARY FOOD BEFORE RELEASE) AND HARD-RELEASE (NO ACCLIMATISATION AND NO SUPPLEMENTARY FOOD). WE MONITORED THE BANDICOOTS INTENSIVELY VIA RADIO-TRACKING AND LIVE-TRAPPING FOR 4 WEEKS AFTER RELEASE. COMPARED WITH HARD-RELEASE BANDICOOTS, WE PREDICTED THAT SOFT-RELEASE BANDICOOTS WOULD HAVE (1) REDUCED MOVEMENT (FIRST NIGHT DISPERSAL, SITE FIDELITY AND ACTIVITY RANGE), (2) MORE DIRECTED PATTERNS OF HABITAT SELECTION, (3) IMPROVED BODYWEIGHTS AND (4) IMPROVED SURVIVAL. KEY RESULTS THERE WAS NO DETECTABLE DIFFERENCE IN HABITAT SELECTION, OVERALL WEIGHT CHANGE AND SURVIVAL BETWEEN THE SOFT-RELEASE AND HARD-RELEASE GROUPS. THERE WAS MODERATE EVIDENCE THAT, COMPARED WITH THE HARD-RELEASE GROUP, SOFT-RELEASE BANDICOOTS MOVED LESS, DEMONSTRATED LOWER INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN ALL MEASURES OF MOVEMENT, AND LOST WEIGHT MORE GRADUALLY AFTER RELEASE. IN MOST CASES, EFFECT SIZES WERE MODERATE TO LARGE BUT HAD LARGE STANDARD ERRORS OWING TO BOTH SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND HIGH VARIANCE. CONSEQUENTLY, STATISTICAL TESTING FAILED TO DETECT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AT THE 5% LEVEL. CONCLUSIONS DESPITE EVIDENCE THAT THE RELEASE METHOD INFLUENCED SOME OF THE MONITORED BEHAVIOURS, SOFT-RELEASE DID NOT CONFER A CONSISTENT AND SUBSTANTIVE ADVANTAGE FOR CAPTIVE-BRED EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOTS AT OUR SITE. WE CONCLUDE THAT SOFT-RELEASE IS UNLIKELY TO IMPROVE OVERALL REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS FOR THIS SPECIES AT FENCED PREDATOR-FREE SITES. IMPLICATIONS THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE PREFERRED OPTION FOR REINTRODUCTIONS OF EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOTS TO FENCED SITES IS A HARD-RELEASE, INFORMATION THAT IS NOW BEING USED TO GUIDE REINTRODUCTIONS OF THIS SPECIES. SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN TO IMPROVE REINTRODUCTION PRACTICE FOR OTHER ENDANGERED SPECIES.",3

WE ASSESSED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SEASONS, SEXES, AGE CLASSES, AND TYPES OF REARING. THE AVERAGE DAILY HOURS OF ACTIVITY WAS 8:43 H. CAMERA-TRAPS AND RADIO-TELEMETRY SHOWED SIMILAR RESULTS. ANIMALS EXHIBITED BOTH DIURNAL (60–65%) AND NOCTURNAL (40–35%) ACTIVITY. THE HIGHER PROBABILITY FOR BEING ACTIVE RANGED WITHIN 09:00–03:00 H. ANTEATERS SPENT MORE HOURS ACTIVE AND WERE MORE NOCTURNAL DURING SUMMER. ACTIVITY WAS HIGHLY OVERLAPPED BETWEEN SEXES, AND WILD-REARED INDIVIDUALS WERE MORE NOCTURNAL THAN CAPTIVE-REARED ONES.

SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS ARE ONE OF THESE MEASURES AIMED AT ENHANCING INSECT DIVERSITY AND RELATED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF AES ON RARE AND NON-TARGET SPECIES. TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF THESE AES ON A NON-TARGET SPECIES, THE OCCURRENCE OF THE ENDANGERED COMMON HAMSTER (CRICETUS CRICETUS) WAS MAPPED BY COUNTING REOPENED WINTER BURROWS ON PAIRED SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS AND AGRICULTURAL FIELDS IN NORTH-WEST BAVARIA, GERMANY. CONCENTRATION EFFECTS IN SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF C CRICETUS IN ADJACENT AGRICULTURAL FIELDS WERE STUDIED BY MAPPING BURROWS UP TO A DISTANCE OF 200 M FROM SOWN WILDFLOWER AND AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. FURTHERMORE, C CRICETUS OCCURRENCE IN RELATION TO LOCAL (VEGETATION DENSITY, COVER OF GRASSES, VEGETATION HEIGHT, SIZE OF WILDFLOWER FIELDS) AND LANDSCAPE SCALE PARAMETERS (PERCENTAGE OF ARABLE LAND, GRASSLAND, FALLOW LAND, DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST FOREST, AND SETTLEMENT) OF SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS WAS ANALYSED. RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE WAS A CONCENTRATION OF C CRICETUS IN SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS, WHILE DENSITIES IN ADJACENT AGRICULTURAL FIELDS WERE CONSTANTLY LOW. HAMSTER OCCURRENCE WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO VEGETATION DENSITY AND GRASS COVER ON SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS AND POSITIVELY RELATED TO DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST FORESTS, PERCENTAGE OF ARABLE LAND AND FALLOW LAND AROUND WILDFLOWER FIELDS.

THE ENHANCEMENT OF WILD RABBIT POPULATIONS HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED THROUGH THE USE OF IN SITU EXTENSIVE RABBIT CAPTIVE BREEDING ENCLOSURES (RESTOCKING PLOTS), WHICH REDUCE MORTALITY CAUSED BY TERRESTRIAL PREDATORS AND DISPERSAL MOVEMENTS AND PERMIT THE BREEDING OF YOUNG INDIVIDUALS WHICH CAN THEN NATURALLY DISPERSE TO SETTLE IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS.

WE MEASURED RABBIT ABUNDANCE IN A VAST AREA IN WHICH THIRTY-TWO RESTOCKING PLOTS WERE BUILT TO CREATE AN INITIAL RABBIT POPULATION FOR FURTHER DISPERSION, IN ADDITION TO AN INTENSIVE HABITAT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. WE ALSO COMPARED RABBIT ABUNDANCE BETWEEN MANAGED AND UNMANAGED UTM CELLS OF 2.5 KM X 2.5 KM. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT RABBIT ABUNDANCE WAS THREE TIMES HIGHER IN MANAGED CELLS, BUT FOUR YEARS AFTER RESTOCKING, RABBIT ABUNDANCES HAD ONLY REACHED THE THRESHOLD NEEDED TO SUPPORT STABLE IBERIAN LYNX PRESENCE (AT LEAST 10 LATRINES PER KM 1) IN 9 OF THE 23 MANAGED CELLS.

ATTEMPTS TO REINTRODUCE ONE OF THE MOST ENDANGERED MAMMALS IN NORTH AMERICA, THE BLACK-FOOTED FERRET (MUSTELA NIGRIPES), HAVE BEEN ONGOING FOR 18 YEARS WITH NO QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF FACTORS RELATED TO REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS. WE EXAMINED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FERRET REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS AND FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE OUTBREAKS, RELEASE STRATEGIES, AND THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF THEIR PRIMARY PREY, PRAIRIE DOGS (CYNOMYS SP.), AT 11 REINTRODUCTION SITES. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR RELATED TO FERRET REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS WAS A CUMULATIVE METRIC INCORPORATING BOTH SIZE OF THE AREA OCCUPIED BY PRAIRIE DOGS AND DENSITY OF PRAIRIE DOG BURROWS WITHIN THAT AREA. EACH OF THE FOUR SUCCESSFUL SITES HAD PRAIRIE DOG POPULATIONS THAT OCCUPIED AN AREA OF AT LEAST 4300 HA. NO SITES WITH <4300 HA OF PRAIRIE DOGS WERE SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING >= 30 ADULT INDIVIDUAL FERRETS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS WITHOUT AUGMENTATION EVEN IF THEY HAD A HIGH PRAIRIE DOG BURROW DENSITY. THE OVERARCHING IMPORTANCE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF HIGH-QUALITY HABITAT SUGGESTS MANAGERS SHOULD PRIORITIZE ACTIONS THAT MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGE AREAS WITH HIGH PRAIRIE DOG BURROW DENSITY, WHICH ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY RARE DUE TO ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS AND DISEASE OUTBREAKS.

THE ENDANGERED AFRICAN WILD DOG (LYCAON PICTUS TEMMINCK, 1820) IS WIDE RANGING AND UNRESTRICTED BY CONVENTIONAL FENCES, THEREBY POSING A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO CONSERVATION MANAGERS. WILD DOGS ARE TERRITORIAL AND COMMUNICATE RESIDENCE USING SCENT MARKS. SIMULATING THE PRESENCE OF OTHER WILD DOGS USING TRANSLOCATED FOREIGN SCENT MARKS MAY THEREFORE REPRESENT A MEANS TO MANAGE WILD DOG RANGING BEHAVIOUR. AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF USING TARGETED SCENT-MARK DEPLOYMENTS TO SIGNAL A WILD DOG PACK TO RETURN TO THEIR FREQUENTED RANGE WITHIN THE SAFETY OF A PROTECTED AREA. METHODS WE REPORT ON THE RANGING BEHAVIOUR OF A WILD DOG PACK REINTRODUCED INTO A WILDLIFE AREA IN BOTSWANA WITH NO RECENT HISTORY OF RESIDENT WILD DOGS. WE DESCRIBE DAILY MOVEMENTS BY THE FREE-RANGING INTRODUCED PACK AND COMPARE THESE TO MOVES FOLLOWING TARGETED DEPLOYMENT OF SCENT MARKS WHEN THE WILD DOG PACK HAD RANGED CLOSE TO OR OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PROTECTED AREA. KEY RESULTS TARGETED FOREIGN SCENT-MARK EXPOSURE RESULTED IN THE PACK MOVING CLOSER TO THE GEOMETRIC CENTRE OF ITS RANGE. THE MEAN DISTANCE TRAVELLED THE DAY AFTER EXPOSURE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THE DISTANCE TRAVELLED THE PREVIOUS DAY AND THE MEAN DAILY DISTANCE MOVED DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. CONCLUSIONS TARGETED EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN SCENT MARKS PROVED TO BE A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO RECAPTURING DOGS THAT HAD RANGED BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF THE WILDLIFE AREA. IMPLICATIONS THIS NOVEL APPROACH TO MANAGING FREE-RANGING CARNIVORES UTILISES BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT SIGNALS AND HOLDS POTENTIAL NOT ONLY FOR THE CONSERVATION OF AFRICAN WILD DOGS, BUT ALSO FOR OTHER TERRITORIAL SPECIES.",1

PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE MIGRATORY BEHAVIOR OF FED AND UNFED ELK DIFFERED IN DISTANCE MIGRATED, AND THE TIMING OF ARRIVAL TO, DURATION ON, AND DEPARTURE FROM SUMMER RANGE. FED ELK MIGRATED 19.2 KM LESS, SPENT 11 MORE DAYS ON STOPOVER SITES, ARRIVED TO SUMMER RANGE 5 DAYS LATER, RESIDED ON SUMMER RANGE 26 FEWER DAYS, AND DEPARTED IN THE AUTUMN 10 DAYS EARLIER THAN UNFED ELK. TIME-TO-EVENT MODELS INDICATED THAT DIFFERENCES IN MIGRATORY BEHAVIOR BETWEEN FED AND UNFED ELK WERE CAUSED BY ALTERED SENSITIVITY TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS OF MIGRATION.

WE LIVE-TRAPPED MICE, VOLES AND SHREWS IN SPRING AND AUTUMN IN 2 YEARS (FOUR SAMPLING PERIODS) AT TWO SITES IN SIX HABITAT TYPES: CROPLANDS, GRASSLANDS RESTORED 3-6 YEARS EARLIER AND NATURAL GRASSLANDS. DATA ON 421 INDIVIDUALS OF 12 SPECIES SHOWED THAT RESTORED GRASSLANDS WERE SIMILAR TO CROPLANDS AND NATURAL GRASSLANDS IN SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE AND COMPOSITION. AT THE LOCAL SCALE, MANAGEMENT INFLUENCED ABUNDANCE BECAUSE THERE WERE MORE SMALL MAMMALS IN UNMANAGED AND EARLY-MOWN GRASSLANDS WITH TALLER VEGETATION THAN IN LATE-MOWN OR GRAZED GRASSLANDS WITH LOWER VEGETATION, OR IN PLOUGHED CROPLANDS. ELEVATION WAS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE SITES AT HIGHER ELEVATION PROVIDED REFUGES DURING SPRING FLOODS OR SUMMER DROUGHTS. AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE, THE PROPORTION OF RESTORED AND NATURAL GRASSLANDS POSITIVELY AFFECTED THE ABUNDANCE OF SMALL MAMMALS, WHEREAS THE PROPORTION OF LINEAR HABITATS (ROADS, CANALS) HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON ABUNDANCE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT MANAGEMENT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN RESTORATION PER SE AT THE LOCAL SCALE, WHICH IS EXPECTED FOR HABITAT GENERALISTS SUCH AS SMALL MAMMALS IN CONTRAST TO SPECIALISTS SUCH AS PLANT-FEEDING INVERTEBRATES. HOWEVER, RESTORATION PROVIDES LANDSCAPE-SCALE BENEFITS BY INCREASING THE AREA OF GRASSLANDS THAT CAN SERVE AS REFUGES FOR SMALL MAMMALS IN UNFAVOURABLE PERIODS.

ARID AUSTRALIA HAS THE WORLD'S WORST MODERN MAMMALIAN EXTINCTION RECORD, LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMPETITION FROM INTRODUCED HERBIVORES, PARTICULARLY EUROPEAN RABBITS (ORYCTOLAGUS CUNICULUS) AND PREDATION BY FERAL CATS (FELIS CATUS) AND FOXES (VULPES VULPES). THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENT RABBIT HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE VIRUS (RHDV) WAS INTRODUCED TO AUSTRALIA IN 1995 AND RESULTED IN DRAMATIC, WIDESPREAD RABBIT SUPPRESSION. WE COMPARED THE AREA OF OCCUPANCY AND EXTENT OF OCCURRENCE OF 4 EXTANT SPECIES OF SMALL MAMMALS BEFORE AND AFTER RHDV OUTBREAK, RELATIVE TO RAINFALL, SAMPLING EFFORT, AND RABBIT AND PREDATOR POPULATIONS. DESPITE LOW RAINFALL DURING THE FIRST 14 YEARS AFTER RHDV, 2 NATIVE RODENTS LISTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE (IUCN), THE DUSKY HOPPING-MOUSE (NOTOMYS FUSCUS) AND PLAINS MOUSE (PSEUDOMYS AUSTRALIS), INCREASED THEIR EXTENT OF OCCURRENCE BY 241-365\%. A THREATENED MARSUPIAL MICROPREDATOR, THE CREST-TAILED MULGARA (DASYCERCUS CRISTICAUDA), UNDERWENT A 70-FOLD INCREASE IN EXTENT OF OCCURRENCE AND A 20-FOLD INCREASE IN AREA OF OCCUPANCY. BOTH BOTTOM-UP AND TOP-DOWN TROPHIC EFFECTS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO RHDV, NAMELY DECREASED COMPETITION FOR FOOD RESOURCES AND DECLINES IN RABBIT-DEPENDENT PREDATORS. BASED ON THESE SUSTAINED INCREASES, THESE 3 PREVIOUSLY THREATENED SPECIES NOW QUALIFY FOR THREAT-CATEGORY DOWNGRADING ON THE IUCN RED LIST. THESE RECOVERIES ARE ON A SCALE RARELY DOCUMENTED IN MAMMALS AND GIVE IMPETUS TO PROGRAMS AIMED AT TARGETED USE OF RHDV IN AUSTRALIA, RATHER THAN SIMPLY EMPLOYING TOP-DOWN THREAT-BASED MANAGEMENT OF ARID ECOSYSTEMS. CONSERVATION PROGRAMS THAT TAKE BIG-PICTURE APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING THREATENING PROCESSES OVER LARGE SPATIAL SCALES SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED TO MAXIMIZE RETURN FROM SCARCE CONSERVATION FUNDING. FURTHER, THESE SHOULD BE COUPLED WITH LONG-TERM ECOLOGICAL MONITORING, A CRITICAL TOOL IN DETECTING AND UNDERSTANDING COMPLEX ECOSYSTEM CHANGE. BIOCONTROL DE CONEJOS Y RECUPERACION A ESCALA DE PAISAJE DE MAMIFEROS AMENAZADOS DEL DESIERTO EL FINANCIAMIENTO PARA LA CONSERVACION DE ESPECIES NO ES SUFICIENTE PARA ENFRENTAR A LA CRISIS ACTUAL DE LA BIODIVERSIDAD Y AUN ASI, MUCHOS PROGRAMAS USAN ACCIONES INASEQUIBLES DE RECUPERACION Y DE UNA SOLA ESPECIE Y DESCUIDAN AL MANEJO MAS GENERAL QUE ABORDA LOS PROCESOS AMENAZANTES. LA ZONA ARIDA DE AUSTRALIA TIENE EL PEOR REGISTRO MODERNO DE EXTINCION DE MAMIFEROS DEL MUNDO, EN SU MAYORIA ATRIBUIBLE A LA COMPETENCIA CON LOS HERBIVOROS INTRODUCIDOS, PARTICULARMENTE EL CONEJO EUROPEO (ORYCTOLAGUS CUNICULUS), Y A LA DEPREDACION POR PARTE DE LOS GATOS FERALES (FELIS CATUS) Y LOS ZORROS (VULPES VULPES). EL AGENTE DE CONTROL BIOLOGICO VEHC (VIRUS DE LA ENFERMEDAD HEMORRAGICA DE CONEJOS) SE INTRODUJO A AUSTRALIA EN 1995 Y RESULTO EN UNA REPRESION DRAMATICA Y EXTENDIDA DE LOS CONEJOS.

A PESAR DE LA POCA LLUVIA DURANTE LOS PRIMEROS 14 ANOS DESPUES DEL VEHC, DOS ROEDORES NATIVOS ENLISTADOS POR LA UNION INTERNACIONAL PARA LA CONSERVACION DE LA NATURALEZA (UICN), LA RATA CANGURO (NOTOMYS FUSCUS) Y EL RATON DE LAS PRADERAS (PSEUDOMYS AUSTRALIS), INCREMENTARON SU EXTENSION EN UN 241-365\%. UN MICRO-DEPREDADOR MARSUPIAL AMENAZADO, LA RATA MARSUPIAL DE COLA CRESTADA (DASYCERCUS CRISTICAUDA), EXPERIMENTO UN INCREMENTO DE 70 VECES EN LA EXTENSION DE SU PRESENCIA Y UNA DE 20 VECES EN EL AREA DE OCUPACION. AMBOS EFECTOS TROFICOS DE ABAJO-HACIA-ARRIBA Y DE ARRIBA-HACIA-ABAJO FUERON ATRIBUIDOS AL VEHC, ESPECIFICAMENTE LA COMPETENCIA REDUCIDA POR LOS RECURSOS ALIMENTICIOS Y LA DECLINACION DE DEPREDADORES DEPENDIENTES DE LOS CONEJOS.

HERE, WE SHOW THAT PAYING SAMI REINDEER HERDERS FOR WOLVERINE (GULO GULO) REPRODUCTIONS HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THE RECOVERY OF WOLVERINES IN SWEDEN. ADULT FEMALE WOLVERINES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPOSED TO ILLEGAL KILLING AND THIS ALLOWED THE POPULATION TO MORE THAN DOUBLE IN A DECADE. WE ARGUE THAT THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES PROTECTION FOR ADULT FEMALE WOLVERINES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DIRECT MONETARY VALUE AND INDIRECT PROTECTION BECAUSE OF MONITORING ACTIVITIES.

LIVE-TRAPPING IS A FUNDAMENTAL TOOL IN THE STUDY OF WILDLIFE SPECIES AND POPULATIONS. CAPTURE OF NONTARGET SPECIES IS AN INHERENT SIDE-EFFECT OF TRAPPING ANIMALS THAT IS INEFFICIENT AND POTENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL TO INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS. REDUCING RECAPTURE OF NONTARGET SPECIES WILL INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF LONG-TERM STUDIES AND PROJECTS, AND MINIMIZE UNWANTED IMPACTS. 2. DURING THE INITIAL STAGES OF A 3-YEAR FERAL CAT FELIS CATUS CONTROL PROGRAMME ON SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND, CALIFORNIA, USA, WE EXPERIENCED HIGH RECAPTURE RATES OF NONTARGET ENDANGERED SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND FOXES UROCYON LITTORALIS CLEMENTAE, IMPACTING PROJECT EFFICIENCY AND POTENTIALLY FOXES. 3. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER WE COULD MODIFY OUR BAITING STRATEGY TO REDUCE FOX RECAPTURES USING BEHAVIOURAL MODIFICATION TECHNIQUES, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAINTAINING THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE FERAL CATS. WE TESTED TWO STRATEGIES, AVERSIVE CONDITIONING AND REWARD REMOVAL, TO REDUCE FOX RECAPTURE RATES. 4. USING LITHIUM CHLORIDE (LC) AS AN AVERSIVE AGENT, WE REDUCED FOX RECAPTURE RATES MORE THAN 10 TIMES COMPARED WITH RATES USING CONTROL BAIT. USING THE REWARD REMOVAL TECHNIQUE, WE REDUCED FOX RECAPTURE RATES ALMOST 20 TIMES COMPARED WITH CONTROL BAITS. NEITHER BEHAVIOURAL MODIFICATION TECHNIQUE DETERRED CATS FROM ENTERING TRAPS, AND OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT BY REDUCING FOX RECAPTURES, WE IMPROVED OUR ABILITY TO CAPTURE CATS. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THESE NOVEL BAITING STRATEGIES HAVE WIDE APPLICABILITY IN WILDLIFE RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT. THE EFFICIENCY OF LONG-TERM MONITORING OR CONTROL PROGRAMMES MAY BE ENHANCED BY DISCOURAGING RECAPTURE OF `TRAP HAPPY' ANIMALS.

DURING 2006-2010 WE REMOVED MINK FROM THE RIVER MONNOW CATCHMENT IN WESTERN BRITAIN, USING TRACK-RECORDING RAFTS TO MONITOR CONTINUOUSLY FOR MINK PRESENCE, GUIDING A STRATEGIC TRAPPING EFFORT. THE AREA MONITORED AND TRAPPED WAS INCREASED IN STAGES, FROM A CORE SUB-CATCHMENT WITH 109 KM OF WATER-COURSE IN 2006, TO A 421-KM<SUP>2</SUP> CATCHMENT WITH 203 KM OF WATER-COURSE IN 2009. IN EACH SUCCESSIVE SUB-CATCHMENT, MINK DETECTION AND CAPTURE RATES DECLINED RAPIDLY TO NEAR-ZERO LEVELS AFTER TRAPPING BEGAN. DETECTIONS AND CAPTURES SHOWED SEASONAL PEAKS IN EVERY YEAR CORRESPONDING TO KNOWN DISPERSAL PERIODS, BUT ALSO DECLINED STEADILY FROM YEAR TO YEAR, WITH INCREASING PERIODS IN WHICH WE DID NOT DETECT MINK. THESE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT EACH SUB-CATCHMENT WAS CLEARED OF MINK WITHIN A FEW MONTHS, WITH SUBSEQUENT CAPTURES ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMMIGRATION. ON AVERAGE, WE DETECTED EACH MINK 5.1 TIMES BEFORE CAPTURE (DAILY PROBABILITY OF DETECTION = 0.059 PER MINK AND RAFT), AND TRAPPED THEM 3.4 DAYS AFTER DEPLOYING TRAPS IN RESPONSE. ON AVERAGE, MINK ENTERING THE AREA WERE LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN PRESENT FOR LESS THAN 13 DAYS BEFORE CAPTURE. WATER VOLES HAD BEEN EXTINCT IN THE MONNOW CATCHMENT SINCE THE 1980S. DURING 2006-2008 (STARTING 6 MONTHS AFTER MINK TRAPPING COMMENCED), WE RELEASED 700 CAPTIVE-BRED WATER VOLES INTO THE TREATMENT AREA TO RE-ESTABLISH A WILD POPULATION. PERSISTENCE OF THIS POPULATION THROUGH THE 4 YEARS OF THE PROJECT WAS CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF EFFECTIVE MINK CONTROL. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT, EVEN IN A MAINLAND CONTEXT, A SYSTEMATIC TRAPPING STRATEGY CAN HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF A DAMAGING SPECIES, IN THIS CASE ALLOWING THE RESTORATION OF A NATIVE PREY SPECIES. &#XA9; 2013 THE WILDLIFE SOCIETY.",1

ECONOMIC DAMAGE WAS INCONSEQUENTIAL ON A NATIONAL SCALE BUT HIGH LOCALLY: C. 80% OF REPORTED LOSSES OCCURRED AT 12% OF SHEEP FLOCKS. GREY WOLVES CANIS LUPUS WERE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR FOUR TO SIX TIMES MORE DAMAGE THAN BROWN BEARS URSUS ARCTOS , ALTHOUGH LIVESTOCK OCCURRED IN ONLY 2 OF 78 WOLF FAECES DURING SPRING–AUTUMN, WHEN SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE MOST VULNERABLE.

AIMS THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFECT OF REARING METHOD ON SURVIVAL AND BODY MASS OF CAPTIVE-RAISED TASMANIAN DEVILS (SARCOPHILUS HARRISII) FOLLOWING RELEASE ON AN OFFSHORE ISLAND. WE ALSO COMPARED THE POST-RELEASE DIET OF THESE DEVILS WITH THE DIET OF WILD DEVILS ON MAINLAND TASMANIA, WHERE A SIMILAR ARRAY OF DIET ITEMS IS AVAILABLE. METHODS TWENTY-EIGHT CAPTIVE-RAISED DEVILS WERE RELEASED ONTO THE ISLAND; 19 HAD BEEN RAISED IN INTENSIVE CAPTIVE-MANAGEMENT FACILITIES (IC) AND NINE IN FREE-RANGE (22 HA) ENCLOSURES (FRE). SURVIVAL AND BODY-MASS CHANGE WERE COMPARED BETWEEN IC AND FRE FOR UP TO 440 DAYS POST-RELEASE. DEVIL DIET WAS ASSESSED VIA SCAT ANALYSIS. KEY RESULTS A HIGH PROPORTION (96%) OF THE FOUNDERS SURVIVED 1 YEAR POST-RELEASE. PRE-RELEASE CAPTIVE-REARING METHOD HAD NO EFFECT. RELEASED DEVILS GAINED AN AVERAGE OF 14% OF THEIR ORIGINAL BODY MASS, IRRESPECTIVE OF CAPTIVE-REARING METHOD. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE DIET OF CAPTIVE-REARED DEVILS RELEASED ONTO MARIA ISLAND RELATIVE TO WILD MAINLAND DEVILS: TASMANIAN PADEMELON, THYLOGALE BILLARDIERII, WAS THE PRIMARY FOOD ITEM FOR BOTH. CONCLUSIONS THE INTENSITY OF CAPTIVE REARING DID NOT AFFECT THE SURVIVAL OF DEVILS RELEASED ONTO MARIA ISLAND. THIS SUGGESTS THAT EVEN DEVILS HELD IN IC FACILITIES RETAIN THE INNATE BEHAVIOUR REQUIRED TO SCAVENGE AND HUNT PREY, AND THEREFORE MAINTAIN BODYWEIGHT POST-RELEASE.

HOWEVER, THE ABILITY OF CROSSING STRUCTURES TO ALLOW INDIVIDUAL AND POPULATION-LEVEL MOVEMENTS ACROSS ROAD NETWORKS REMAINS UNKNOWN. IN APRIL 2006, WE INITIATED A 3-YEAR INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER CROSSING STRUCTURES PROVIDE DEMOGRAPHIC CONNECTIVITY FOR GRIZZLY AND BLACK BEARS IN BANFF NATIONAL PARK. WE COLLECTED HAIR WITH MULTIPLE NONINVASIVE METHODS TO OBTAIN GENETIC SAMPLES FROM GRIZZLY AND BLACK BEARS AROUND THE BOW VALLEY. OUR OBJECTIVES WERE TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF MALE AND FEMALE GRIZZLY AND BLACK BEARS THAT USE CROSSING STRUCTURES; EXAMINE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF CROSSINGS; AND ESTIMATE THE PROPORTIONS OF GRIZZLY AND BLACK BEAR POPULATIONS IN THE BOW VALLEY THAT USE CROSSING STRUCTURES. FIFTEEN GRIZZLY (7 FEMALE, 8 MALE) AND 17 BLACK BEARS (8 FEMALE, 9 MALE) USED WILDLIFE CROSSING STRUCTURES. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS DETECTED AT WILDLIFE CROSSING STRUCTURES WAS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE NUMBER OF PASSAGES IN SPACE AND TIME. GRIZZLY BEARS USED OPEN CROSSING STRUCTURES (E.G., OVERPASSES) MORE OFTEN THAN CONSTRICTED CROSSINGS (E.G., CULVERTS). PEAK USE OF CROSSING STRUCTURES FOR BOTH BEAR SPECIES OCCURRED IN JULY, WHEN HIGH RATES OF FORAGING ACTIVITY COINCIDE WITH MATING SEASON.

WE TRANSLOCATED WOODRATS FROM GENETICALLY DIVERSE POPULATIONS IN THE CORE OF THE SPECIES RANGE TO 4 PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED SITES (REINTRODUCTIONS) AND 2 SITES SUPPORTING GENETICALLY DEPAUPERATE POPULATIONS (REINFORCEMENTS) IN INDIANA (U.S.A.). IN 2 REINTRODUCTION SITES AND 1 REINFORCEMENT SITE, WE DISTRIBUTED ANTHELMINTIC BAITS TO PASSIVELY DEWORM RACCOONS AND REDUCE THE RISK OF WOODRAT EXPOSURE TO ROUNDWORMS. THE REMAINING SITES SERVED AS CONTROLS. WE USED RACCOON LATRINE SURVEYS AND FECAL FLOTATION TO MONITOR TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN ROUNDWORM PREVALENCE AND EFFECT OF TREATMENT. WE USED LIVE TRAPPING AND MICROSATELLITE GENOTYPING TO MONITOR THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND GENETIC RESPONSE OF TRANSLOCATED POPULATIONS OVER THE FOLLOWING 54 MONTHS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE STUDY, 4 OF 6 TRANSLOCATIONS WERE SUCCESSFULLY MAINTAINING ABUNDANCE THROUGH LOCAL RECRUITMENT. THE DISTRIBUTION OF ANTHELMINTIC BAITS REDUCED LEVELS OF ROUNDWORM CONTAMINATION, BUT LEVELS OF CONTAMINATION WERE ALSO LOW IN 2 OF 3 CONTROL SITES. REINTRODUCTIONS FAILED AT CONTROL SITES, ONE OF WHICH WAS DUE TO HIGH ROUNDWORM EXPOSURE. THE OTHER FAILED CONTROL REINTRODUCTION WAS LIKELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DEMOGRAPHIC STOCHASTICITY AND LIMITED REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL FOLLOWING INITIAL MORTALITY WITHIN THE FIRST 4 MONTHS. IN BOTH CONTROL AND TREATMENT REINFORCEMENTS, INCREASES IN BOTH ALLELIC RICHNESS AND HETEROZYGOSITY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASES IN ABUNDANCE, WHICH IS SUGGESTIVE OF GENETIC RESCUE.

MANY STUDIES HAVE MONITORED THE USE OF STRUCTURES BY WILDLIFE, BUT STUDIES THAT ALSO INCORPORATE INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFICATION METHODS CAN OFFER ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS INTO THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. AIMS WE MONITORED THE USE OF WILDLIFE CROSSING STRUCTURES BY ARBOREAL MARSUPIALS ALONG THE HUME FREEWAY IN SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA TO (1) DETERMINE THE SPECIES USING THESE STRUCTURES AND THEIR FREQUENCY OF CROSSING, (2) DETERMINE THE NUMBER AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUALS CROSSING, AND (3) USE THE RATE OF CROSSING BY INDIVIDUALS TO INFER THE TYPES OF MOVEMENT THAT OCCURRED. METHODS WE USED MOTION-TRIGGERED CAMERAS TO MONITOR FIVE CANOPY BRIDGES AND 15 GLIDER POLE ARRAYS INSTALLED AT 13 SITES ALONG THE HUME FREEWAY. THE FIVE CANOPY BRIDGES WERE ALSO MONITORED WITH PASSIVE INTEGRATED TRANSPONDER (PIT)-TAG READERS TO IDENTIFY THE RATE OF USE BY INDIVIDUALS. KEY RESULTS FIVE SPECIES OF ARBOREAL MARSUPIAL WERE DETECTED USING CANOPY BRIDGES AND GLIDER POLES AT 11 SITES. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT INCREASING THE NUMBER AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN POLES IN A GLIDER POLE ARRAY REDUCED THE RATE OF USE BY SQUIRREL GLIDERS. THE PIT TAG AND CAMERA FOOTAGE REVEALED THAT THE STRUCTURES WERE USED BY ADULT MALES, ADULT FEMALES AND JUVENILES, SUGGESTING THAT ALL DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS ARE CAPABLE OF USING CANOPY BRIDGES AND GLIDER POLES. AT TWO CANOPY BRIDGES, MULTIPLE SQUIRREL GLIDERS AND COMMON BRUSHTAIL POSSUMS CROSSED MORE THAN ONCE PER NIGHT. CONCLUSIONS GIVEN THAT PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE FREEWAY IS A BARRIER TO MOVEMENT, AND THAT MANY OF THE SPECIES DETECTED CROSSING ARE SUBJECT TO ROAD MORTALITY, WE CONCLUDE THAT CANOPY BRIDGES AND GLIDER POLES BENEFIT ARBOREAL MARSUPIALS BY PROVIDING SAFE ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE INACCESSIBLE. IMPLICATIONS ALTHOUGH THE FACTORS INFLUENCING CROSSING RATE REQUIRE FURTHER STUDY, OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT GLIDER POLE ARRAYS WITH FEWER POLES PLACED CLOSER TOGETHER ARE LIKELY TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL FOR SQUIRREL GLIDERS. THE INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFICATION METHODS APPLIED HERE OFFER INSIGHTS THAT ARE NOT POSSIBLE FROM MEASURING THE RATE OF USE ALONE AND SHOULD BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE MONITORING STUDIES.",2

HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF REINTRODUCTIONS HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEEN DOCUMENTED IN THE LITERATURE. GIVEN THE GLOBAL DECLINE OF LARGE CARNIVORES, DOCUMENTING THE RESULTS OF SUCH ATTEMPTS IS CRUCIAL FOR FUTURE CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT. HERE WE EXAMINED THE REINTRODUCTION OF BROWN BEARS INTO THE ITALIAN ALPS. THE MAJORITY OF BEARS RELEASED (10 INDIVIDUALS) ADAPTED WELL TO THE RELEASE AREA AND THIS RESULTED IN THE INCREASE OF THE BROWN BEAR POPULATION. AT THE END OF 2012, THE AREA WITH A STABLE PRESENCE OF FEMALES WAS AROUND 1250 KM(2) (MINIMUM DENSITY = 3 BEAR/100 KM(2)). BETWEEN 2002 AND 2012, 34 REPRODUCTIVE EVENTS OCCURRED AND A TOTAL OF 74 CUBS WERE BORN, THUS REACHING A MINIMUM POPULATION SIZE OF 47 INDIVIDUALS. NO LESS THAN 21 YOUNG MALES DISPERSED INTO ADJACENT ITALIAN REGIONS OR INTO OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH AS SWITZERLAND, AUSTRIA, AND GERMANY. HOWEVER, DESPITE A HIGH MORTALITY RATE AND AT LEAST TWO CASES OF ILLEGAL KILLING REPORTED IN THE LAST 2 YEARS (2013 AND 2014), A REMARKABLE POPULATION GROWTH RATE (CURRENT LEVEL OF 15.6\%) HAS BEEN OBSERVED. THE DAMAGES CORRELATED WITH BEAR POPULATION SIZE (F = 17.922, P < 0.01) WERE PRIMARILY INFLICTED ON BEEHIVES (39\%) AND LIVESTOCK (26\%), WITH AN ECONOMIC RELEVANCE OF (SIC) 41,374 PER YEAR FOR COMPENSATION AND (SIC) 23,527 PER YEAR FOR PREVENTION. THE ONLY CASE OF INJURY TO HUMANS EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT WAS RECORDED IN 2014, WHEN A FEMALE DEFENDING HER TWO CUBS INFLICTED MINOR PHYSICAL INJURIES TO A MAN. AND YET, PUBLIC OPINION CHANGED RADICALLY, FROM A WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE OF BEARS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT TO AN OPPOSITION TO THEIR PRESENCE, THE INCREASE OF THEIR POPULATION, AND THE NEW TRANSLOCATIONS AIMING AT REPLACING PROBLEM BEARS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN REMOVED. ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT TREND, THE POPULATION MAY REACH A RANGE OF 60-94 INDIVIDUALS IN 2017. THEREFORE, A PROPER MANAGEMENT OF PROBLEM BEARS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A KEY FACTOR FOR THE RESTORATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF THIS SPECIES. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER GMBH.

LIVESTOCK GUARDIAN DOGS (LGDS) MAY BE ABLE TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE PREDATION, BUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN AUSTRALIAN GRAZING SYSTEMS HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATED. IN PARTICULAR, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LGDS IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY RANGE FREELY OVER LARGE AREAS IN COMPANY WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF LIVESTOCK. AIMS WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LGDS AS CURRENTLY USED IN AUSTRALIA AND DETERMINE THE FACTORS INFLUENCING EFFECTIVENESS, IN PARTICULAR IN RELATION TO SCALE OF MANAGEMENT. WE ALSO DOCUMENTED HOW LGDS ARE MANAGED IN AUSTRALIA, EVALUATED THEIR COST EFFECTIVENESS, AND IDENTIFIED FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE NUMBER OF DOGS REQUIRED IN DIFFERENT PROPERTY SITUATIONS. METHODS WE CONDUCTED A TELEPHONE SURVEY OF 150 LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS WITH LGDS IN AUSTRALIA, INCLUDING ALL LIVESTOCK TYPES AND PROPERTY SITUATIONS, IN ALL STATES. TEN PRODUCERS WERE VISITED, OF WHICH ONE IS DETAILED AS A CASE STUDY. KEY RESULTS EFFECTIVENESS WAS APPARENTLY HIGH: 65.7% OF RESPONDENTS REPORTED THAT PREDATION CEASED AFTER OBTAINING LGDS, AND A FURTHER 30.2% REPORTED A DECREASE OF PREDATION. WHEN THE NUMBER OF STOCK PER DOG EXCEEDS 100, LGDS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE ALL PREDATION. DOGS ARE OFTEN KEPT FREE-RANGING ON LARGE PROPERTIES WHERE WILD DOGS ARE THE MAIN PREDATOR, BUT ARE USUALLY RESTRICTED IN THEIR MOVEMENTS ON SMALLER PROPERTIES OR WITH SMALLER PREDATORS. THE COST OF OBTAINING A LGD IS RETURNED WITHIN 1–3 YEARS AFTER THE DOG STARTS WORKING. THE NUMBER OF DOGS REQUIRED FOR A PROPERTY MAINLY DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF LIVESTOCK NEEDING PROTECTION, AND THE MAIN TYPE OF PREDATOR IN THE AREA. CONCLUSIONS PROVIDED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF LGDS ARE USED, THEY CAN BE AS EFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING LIVESTOCK FROM PREDATORS IN AUSTRALIA WHEN RANGING FREELY ON LARGE PROPERTIES WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF LIVESTOCK AS THEY ARE IN SMALL-SCALE FARMING SYSTEMS. IMPLICATIONS LGDS CAN PROVIDE A COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL PREDATOR CONTROL METHODS IN AUSTRALIA’S EXTENSIVE GRAZING ENTERPRISES, POTENTIALLY REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR OTHER FORMS OF CONTROL. LGDS COULD PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN SECURING THE VIABILITY OF LIVESTOCK BUSINESSES AND RECONCILING PEOPLE–PREDATOR CONFLICT IN AUSTRALIA.",1

AMONG SOME REMNANT POPULATIONS, COTTONTAILS OCCUPY SMALL PATCHES OF THICKET HABITAT WHERE THEY EXPERIENCE HIGH MORTALITY RATES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF LIMITED FOOD DURING WINTER. THIS LIMITATION CAUSES RABBITS TO FORAGE AWAY FROM COVER WHERE THEY ARE EXPOSED TO PREDATORS. ALTHOUGH CONSERVATION EFFORTS ARE EMERGING TO REVERSE THE DECLINE OF NEW ENGLAND COTTONTAILS, MOST ARE DIRECTED TOWARD IMPROVING LONG-TERM VIABILITY BY INCREASING THE ABUNDANCE OF SUITABLE HABITATS. SUCH EFFORTS DO LITTLE TO IMPROVE THE SHORT-TERM SURVIVAL OF REMAINING COTTONTAILS. TO ADDRESS THIS IMMEDIATE NEED, WE EVALUATED THE USE OF SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD AS AN APPROACH TO IMPROVE OVER-WINTER SURVIVAL RATES. WE SPECULATED THAT BY POSITIONING FEEDERS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ESCAPE COVER, RABBITS WOULD BE LESS VULNERABLE TO PREDATORS. WE EVALUATED THIS APPROACH USING EASTERN COTTONTAILS (SYLVILAGUS FLORIDANUS) AS A RESEARCH SURROGATE BECAUSE THIS SPECIES IS READILY AVAILABLE AND HAS SIMILAR HABITAT REQUIREMENTS TO NEW ENGLAND COTTONTAILS. TRANSMITTER-EQUIPPED EASTERN COTTONTAILS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER A FED OR UNFED GROUP. REMOTELY-TRIGGERED CAMERAS WERE ALSO USED TO GAUGE USE OF FEEDERS BY COTTONTAILS AND VISITS BY OTHER SPECIES. WINTER SURVIVAL RATES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FOR FED RABBITS (70\%) THAN FOR UNFED RABBITS (32\%). CAMERAS REVEALED THAT RABBITS WERE THE MOST FREQUENT CONSUMER AND THAT THERE WAS ONLY LIMITED CARNIVORE ACTIVITY NEAR FEEDERS. WE CONCLUDE THAT SUPPLEMENTAL FEEDING MAY IMPROVE SURVIVAL OF REMAINING NEW ENGLAND COTTONTAILS AS EFFORTS TO INCREASE HABITAT AVAILABILITY CONTINUE TO DEVELOP. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER LTD.

RECENTLY COMMERCIAL USE OF LOGGING RESIDUES HAS BEEN PROMOTED; HOWEVER, REMOVING ALL LOGGING RESIDUES FROM A PRODUCTION FOREST WOULD SEVERELY AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE DIVERSITY OF GROUND-DWELLING SMALL MAMMALS. IN ADDITION, FOR SMALL MAMMALS WHICH ESSENTIALLY REQUIRE FALLEN TREES TO SURVIVE, POPULATIONS WILL SHRINK OR IN A WORST CASE SCENARIO, THEY WOULD BECOME EXTIRPATED FROM PRODUCTION FORESTS IF ALL LOGGING DEBRIS IS REMOVED.

EIGHT WOYLIES INSIDE THE SANCTUARY AND SEVEN OUTSIDE WERE RADIO-TRACKED IN AUTUMN 2011. THE AVERAGE HOME-RANGE SIZE WAS 65.4 (±8.2, S.E.) HA. THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST ANY DIFFERENCE IN HOME-RANGE SIZE BETWEEN WOYLIES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE SANCTUARY. WOYLIES WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE FOUND IN THE SLOPE AND LOW-LYING VALLEY HABITATS, WHICH HAVE GREATER WATER-HOLDING CAPACITY AND SANDIER SOILS. THESE RELATIVELY LARGE SEASONAL HOME RANGES, COMPARED WITH PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED ESTIMATES FOR THE SPECIES, MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY LOW POPULATION DENSITY, LOWER SEASONAL FOOD AVAILABILITY AND CLUSTERED FOOD DISTRIBUTION.

AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE RESULTING LOSS OF HABITAT HETEROGENEITY, NUMEROUS SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH TRADITIONAL FARMLAND HAVE UNDERGONE SEVERE POPULATION DECLINES. TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE ON FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY, AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES (AES) HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SINCE THE EARLY 1990S. THE EFFECTS OF AES HAVE BEEN EVALUATED FOR DIFFERENT TAXA, BUT RARELY FOR LARGER MAMMALS LIKE THE BROWN HARE (LEPUS EUROPAEUS), A CHARACTERISTIC SPECIES OF TRADITIONAL OPEN FARMLAND. USING SPOTLIGHT COUNTS FROM 58 BROWN HARE MONITORING STUDY SITES OVER 17 YEARS, WE ANALYSED THE EFFECTS OF LAND-USE AND SEVERAL AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME OPTIONS ON BROWN HARE DENSITY IN THE SWISS LOWLAND. WE USED OPEN-POPULATION BINOMIAL MIXTURE MODELS TO JOINTLY MODEL ABUNDANCE AND DETECTION PROBABILITY, THEREBY ACCOUNTING FOR IMPERFECT DETECTION OF HARES. MEAN OBSERVED COUNTS OF BROWN HARES IN SWITZERLAND FROM 1992 TO 2008 SUGGESTED A SLIGHT DECLINE FOLLOWED BY A RECOVERY IN ARABLE STUDY SITES, WHEREAS A SUSTAINED DECLINE WAS APPARENT IN GRASSLAND SITES. MEAN DETECTION PROBABILITY RANGED WIDELY FROM YEAR TO YEAR (ARABLE: 0.33-0.70: GRASSLAND: 0.21-0.80). WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR IMPERFECT DETECTION, A POPULATION RECOVERY WAS APPARENT IN BOTH LAND-USE TYPES, ALTHOUGH HARE DENSITIES REMAINED AT LOW LEVELS COMPARED TO OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE AMOUNT OF EXTENSIVELY MANAGED HAY MEADOWS SEEMED TO HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON BROWN HARE ABUNDANCE BOTH IN ARABLE AND GRASSLAND SITES. HEDGEROWS WERE ALSO POSITIVELY RELATED TO HARE DENSITY, ALTHOUGH ONLY IN ARABLE STUDY SITES. THE AMOUNT OF SET-ASIDES/WILDFLOWER STRIPS AND BROWN HARE DENSITY WERE RELATED NEITHER IN ARABLE NOR IN GRASSLAND SITES. THIS RESULT WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE FAIRLY LOW PERCENTAGES OF THIS AES OPTION IN OUR STUDY SITES. HABITAT IMPROVEMENTS BY MEANS OF AES INDICATE SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS ON BROWN HARE POPULATIONS IN SWITZERLAND, BUT THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF AES MUST STILL BE INCREASED. COMBINED WITH A BINOMIAL MIXTURE MODEL CORRECTING FOR IMPERFECT DETECTION, SPOTLIGHT COUNTS ARE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR ESTIMATING POPULATION TRENDS, ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM SURVEYS LIKE THE SWISS BROWN HARE MONITORING.

USING THE CASE OF REINTRODUCED EUROPEAN BISON (BISON BONASUS L.) IN THE NORTHERN CARPATHIANS, WE SHOW HOW HABITAT SUITABILITY MODELS IN COMBINATION WITH CONNECTIVITY ASSESSMENTS BASED ON CIRCUIT THEORY CAN REMEDY SUCH SHORTCOMINGS, AND IDENTIFY POTENTIAL HABITAT PATCHES AND CORRIDORS BETWEEN THESE. EUROPEAN BISON WERE REINTRODUCED IN OUR STUDY AREA IN THE 1960S, AND AGAINST PRIOR EXPECTATION, HAVE NOT SPREAD ALONG THE CARPATHIAN RIDGE, BUT INSTEAD EXPANDED THEIR RANGE TOWARDS HUMAN SETTLEMENTS. OUR ANALYSES PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS PATTERN. ALTHOUGH WE IDENTIFIED A NETWORK OF SUITABLE HABITAT PATCHES ALONG THE CARPATHIAN RIDGE, THE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM WERE LIMITED DUE TO A NUMBER OF MAJOR BARRIERS TO MOVEMENT. TO AVOID FUTURE CONFLICTS BETWEEN EUROPEAN BISON AND PEOPLE, AND TO ACHIEVE THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF A VIABLE BISON METAPOPULATION IN THIS REGION, CONSERVATION ACTION SHOULD FOCUS ON ESTABLISHING CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN HABITAT PATCHES THROUGH THE CREATION AND LEGAL PROTECTION OF CORRIDORS AND WILDLIFE PASSAGES, WHICH WOULD BENEFIT CARPATHIAN WILDLIFE IN GENERAL.

FROM 2012 TO 2015, WE FIELD-TESTED THE EFFICACY OF BEEHIVE FENCES TO PROTECT 10 0.4-HA FARMS NEXT TO TSAVO EAST NATIONAL PARK FROM ELEPHANTS. WE HUNG A SERIES OF BEEHIVES EVERY 10 M AROUND THE BOUNDARY OF EACH FARM PLOT. THE HIVES WERE LINKED WITH STRONG WIRE. AFTER AN INITIAL PILOT TEST WITH 2 FARMS, THE REMAINING 8 OF 10 BEEHIVE FENCES ALSO CONTAINED 2-DIMENSIONAL DUMMY HIVES BETWEEN REAL BEEHIVES TO HELP REDUCE THE COST OF THE FENCE. EACH TRIAL PLOT HAD A NEIGHBORING CONTROL PLOT OF THE SAME SIZE WITHIN THE SAME FARM. OF THE 131 BEEHIVES DEPLOYED 88\% WERE OCCUPIED AT LEAST ONCE DURING THE 3.5-YEAR TRIAL.

UNEXPECTEDLY, COLONIZATION PROBABILITY WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY A TEMPORAL INCREASE IN WOODY VEGETATION COVER SURROUNDING A PATCH. A PAUCITY OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PATCH COLONIZATION AND THE TEMPORAL CHANGE IN VEGETATION COVER MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE INCREASED VEGETATION COVER IN OUR STUDY LANDSCAPES OVER THE PAST DECADE HAS RESULTED FROM ESTABLISHMENT OF PLANTINGS WHICH ARE GENERALLY NOT SUITABLE NESTING HABITAT FOR ARBOREAL MARSUPIALS.

SEVERAL PAST STUDIES HAVE MONITORED THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL BREEDING STRUCTURES IN THE WILD, BUT VIRTUALLY NONE OF THEM HAVE INVESTIGATED WHICH DEMOGRAPHIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ACTUALLY DETERMINE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN FACILITATING REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY THOSE FACTORS INFLUENCING BREEDING SUCCESS IN ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES. WITH THIS PURPOSE WE SURVEYED A DECLINING POPULATION OF A KEYSTONE SPECIES OF MEDITERRANEAN ECOSYSTEMS, NAMELY THE EUROPEAN WILD RABBIT. IN DONANA NATIONAL PARK, WE SAMPLED DURING THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS THE BREEDING SUCCESS OF WILD RABBITS FROM 47 ARTIFICIAL WARRENS, EXPERIMENTALLY PROVIDED UNDER DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH FACTORS, WE APPLIED AN AIC MODEL SELECTION PROCEDURE TO ALTERNATIVE BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS GROUPS, POSTULATING THAT BREEDING SUCCESS IN ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES WOULD PRIMARILY DEPEND ON POPULATION DENSITY, FOOD AVAILABILITY AND/OR PREDATOR LIMITATION. WE FOUND THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF ARTIFICIAL WARRENS IN FACILITATING RABBIT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS CAN VARY, WITH AN INCREASE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER PASTURE AVAILABILITY. PREDATOR LIMITATION BY FENCING ALSO POSITIVELY AFFECTED RABBIT REPRODUCTION, BUT ONLY IN COMBINATION WITH HIGH PASTURE AVAILABILITY. ON THEIR OWN, FENCING TREATMENT AND POPULATION REINFORCEMENTS HAD LOW AND NULL EFFECTIVENESS FACILITATING REPRODUCTION, RESPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS ENTAILING SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND BIOLOGICAL COSTS. THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE BREEDING SUCCESS IN ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES, THEREFORE, WAS THROUGH THEIR STRATEGIC PLACEMENT IN POTENTIAL HIGH-QUALITY HABITATS, I.E. WITH SUITABLE PASTURE AVAILABILITY. WE SUGGEST THAT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT CAN EFFECTIVELY INCREASE CARRYING CAPACITY AND CONSEQUENTLY THE TARGET SPECIES' REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, ESPECIALLY IN FAST BREEDING SPECIES LIKE THE EUROPEAN WILD RABBIT. THE PROVISION OF ARTIFICIAL BREEDING STRUCTURES FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFIT FROM THE ELABORATION OF CONCURRENT EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES SIMILAR TO THE PRESENT RESEARCH, WHICH CAN HELP ESTABLISH USEFUL GUIDELINES FOR OPTIMIZING FUTURE CONSERVATION EFFORTS.

THIS STUDY PRESENTS DATA ACROSS SITES (167 SAMPLES), TWO SEASONS (WINTER/SPRING, 95 SAMPLES; SUMMER/AUTUMN, 72 SAMPLES), TWO DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS (JUVENILES <1.25 YEARS AND SUBADULTS/ADULTS >1.25 YEARS) AND BOTH SEXES. SEVENTY PERCENT OF RELEASED BTRWS AND 90% OF SYMPATRIC MACROPODIDS WERE POSITIVE FOR MACROPOD HERPES VIRUS; NONE OF THREE BTRWS TESTED FOR TOXOPLASMOSIS WAS POSITIVE. FAECES WERE COLLECTED OPPORTUNISTICALLY FOR FLOTATION AND ECTOPARASITES WERE COLLECTED AND IDENTIFIED. WHILE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS WITH ANAESTHESIA WERE SAFE AND ELIMINATED SOME ANIMALS FROM BEING RELEASED, THEY FAILED TO DETECT ALL CASES OF ORAL CAVITY DISEASE. A REFERENCE RANGE OF HAEMATOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THIS EVOLUTIONARILY SIGNIFICANT UNIT OF BTRW. LYMPHOCYTE/NEUTROPHIL RATIOS OF RELEASED ANIMALS SUGGESTED THAT THE MAIN ACUTE STRESSOR IS A HANDLING PHENOMENON BUT THE OXIDATIVE STRESS INDEX SUGGESTED THAT ANIMALS WERE COPING WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT. SIGNIFICANT SITE DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED FOR SEVERAL VARIABLES INCLUDING RED CELL MASS (RED CELL COUNT, HAEMOGLOBIN, HAEMATOCRIT), WHITE CELL COUNT, LYMPHOCYTE/NEUTROPHIL RATIO, ALBUMIN GLOBULIN RATIO, CREATININE, URATE, ASCORBIC ACID, <U+0391>-TOCOPHEROL, RETINOL, CHOLINESTERASE, TOTAL CAROTENOIDS AND OXIDATIVE STRESS INDEX. SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED FOR SOME VARIABLES, INCLUDING RED CELL MASS, ASCORBIC ACID, ALBUMIN GLOBULIN RATIO, CHOLINESTERASE, TOTAL CAROTENOIDS AND RETINOL. SIGNIFICANT AGE DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED FOR RED CELL MASS, ALBUMIN AND DIETARY ANTIOXIDANTS. THE ONLY SEX-RELATED DIFFERENCE RELATED TO HIGHER RETINOL LEVELS IN FEMALES. THOSE PARAMETERS RELATED TO DIET, E.G. ALBUMIN, RETINOL, <U+0391>-TOCOPHEROL, ASCORBIC ACID, AND TOTAL CAROTENOIDS WERE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE FOUND IN OTHER ROCK-WALLABIES.",1

THE SCHEME WAS EXPANDED IN 2009, BUILDING ON THE INITIAL ELEMENTS OF REAL-TIME CLOSURES (RTCS) AND GEAR REQUIREMENTS. VARIOUS MEASURES WERE AGREED IN A CO-MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK INVOLVING FISHERS, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND SCIENTISTS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO ENCOURAGE COD AVOIDANCE AND THE REDUCTION OF COD DISCARDS USING SPATIAL TOOLS SUCH AS RTCS AND SEASONAL CLOSURES, ALONG WITH GEAR OPTIONS THAT REDUCE COD CAPTURE. THE SCHEME WAS INCENTIVIZED BY REWARDING PARTICIPATION WITH ADDITIONAL DAYS AT SEA. REAL-TIME MONITORING WAS CARRIED OUT WITH EXTENSIVE USE OF FISHERY-DEPENDENT INFORMATION, ALLOWING MANAGEMENT TO BE ADAPTED AS REQUIRED AND TO ADDRESS EMERGING PROBLEMS. THE USE OF VESSEL MONITORING SYSTEM DATA, LOGBOOK RECORDS, FISHERS’ KNOWLEDGE, AND OBSERVER DATA IS DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING AND ASSESSING THE SCHEME. COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLOSURE ELEMENTS OF THE SCHEME WAS JUDGED TO HAVE BEEN GOOD, AND ESTIMATED CATCH RATES BY THE SCOTTISH FLEET MET TARGET CRITERIA, BUT THE ASSESSED CATCH SAVINGS OF COD FROM RTCS WERE LESS THAN PREDICTED.

SEASONAL CLOSURES HAVE OFTEN BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN AN ATTEMPT TO ALLEVIATE SUCH IMPACTS BUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE MEASURES IS RARELY TESTED. THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SPAWNING CLOSURE FOR ATLANTIC COD (GADUS MORHUA) IN THE FIRTH OF CLYDE OFF THE SCOTTISH WEST COAST (ICES AREA VIA). THIS CLOSURE WAS INTRODUCED IN MARCH 2001 AS AN EMERGENCY MEASURE TO ALLOW AS MANY COD AS POSSIBLE TO SPAWN AND AVOID THE BUILD-UP OF DISPLACED EFFORT FROM ANOTHER SPAWNING CLOSURE. GENETIC, TAGGING, AND OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY INVESTIGATIONS INDICATE THAT COD INHABITING THE CLYDE ARE REPRODUCTIVELY ISOLATED FROM OTHER RESIDENT GROUPS IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PART OF THE SCOTTISH WEST COAST STOCK. THIS STUDY USED A BEYOND-BEFORE-AFTER, CONTROL-IMPACT APPROACH TO COMPARE POPULATION TRENDS OF THE CLYDE SPAWNING AGGREGATION BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTRODUCED AREA CLOSURE, USING TWO OTHER SUB-POPULATION SPAWNING GROUNDS AS CONTROL AREAS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF LOCAL RECOVERY IN TERMS OF ABUNDANCE, BIOMASS, OR REDUCED MORTALITY IN THE CLYDE MORE THAN A DECADE AFTER ESTABLISHING THE CLOSURE. MORTALITY MAY HAVE REMAINED HIGH BECAUSE YOUNG COD ARE STILL CAUGHT AS BYCATCH IN THE NEPHROPS FISHERY IN THE AREA AND THE PREDATION RATE MAY HAVE INCREASED DUE TO AN EXPANDING WHITING POPULATION. CONSIDERING THE STATE OF THE ALREADY SEVERELY DEPLETED CLYDE SUB-POPULATION WHEN THE CLOSURE WAS IMPLEMENTED THE MEASURE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN TOO LITTLE AND TOO LATE. THE TENDENCY TO IMPLEMENT SUCH SPAWNING CLOSURES ON NEARLY COLLAPSED STOCKS MAY BE WHY THESE MEASURES OFTEN APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE.",2

THUS, WE EXAMINED THE TOP-DOWN INFLUENCE OF REEF SHARKS (AN APEX PREDATOR ON CORAL REEFS) AND MESOPREDATORS ON LARGE-BODIED HERBIVORES.

SHARK ABUNDANCE AND MESOPREDATOR SIZE AND BIOMASS WERE HIGHER IN NO-ENTRY ZONES THAN IN FISHED AND NO-TAKE ZONES, WHICH INDICATES THE VIABILITY OF STRICTLY ENFORCED HUMAN EXCLUSION AREAS AS TOOLS FOR THE CONSERVATION OF PREDATOR COMMUNITIES.

AUSTRALIA'S OUTER GREAT BARRIER REEF (GBR) HAS EXPERIENCED FISHING-INDUCED DECLINES OF APEX PREDATORS AND MESOPREDATORS, BUT POLLUTION AND TARGETING OF HERBIVOROUS FISHES ARE MINIMAL. HERE, WE QUANTIFY FISH AND BENTHIC ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS A FISHING-INDUCED PREDATOR DENSITY GRADIENT ON THE OUTER GBR, INCLUDING APEX PREDATORS AND MESOPREDATORS TO HERBIVORES AND BENTHIC ASSEMBLAGES, TO TEST FOR EVIDENCE OF TROPHIC CASCADES AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES TO TROPHIC CASCADE THEORY. USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS, WE FOUND NO CASCADING EFFECTS FROM APEX PREDATORS TO LOWER TROPHIC LEVELS: A LOSS OF APEX PREDATORS DID NOT LEAD TO HIGHER LEVELS OF MESOPREDATORS, AND THIS DID NOT SUPPRESS MOBILE HERBIVORES AND DRIVE ALGAL PROLIFERATION. LIKEWISE, WE FOUND NO EFFECTS OF MESOPREDATORS ON LOWER TROPHIC LEVELS: A DECLINE OF MESOPREDATORS WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER ABUNDANCES OF ALGAE-FARMING DAMSELFISHES AND ALGAE-DOMINATED REEFS. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT TOP-DOWN FORCES ON CORAL REEFS ARE WEAK, AT LEAST ON THE OUTER GBR. WE CONCLUDE THAT PREDATOR-MEDIATED TROPHIC CASCADES ARE PROBABLY THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE IN COMPLEX ECOSYSTEMS SUCH AS THE OUTER GBR.",1

FISHING MORTALITY WAS HIGHER FOR NESTING MALES THAN FOR FEMALES (OPEN SITE; TAGGED DURING SPAWNING: 36% VS. 29%; AFTER SPAWNING: 49% VS. 36%) AND WAS FOUND TO BE CAUSED BY NESTING MALES HAVING HIGHER CAPTURE PROBABILITIES THAN FEMALES, INDEPENDENTLY OF BODY SIZE. THE FISHING MORTALITY OF SNEAKER MALES DID NOT DIFFER FROM NESTING MALES, BUT THE SAMPLE OF SNEAKER MALES IN THE STUDY WAS SMALL. THE PROBABILITY OF BEING RETAINED BY FISHERS ONCE CAPTURED DEPENDED ON SIZE, BUT NOT ON SEX.

HOWEVER, ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT OF CORAL REEF FISHERIES HAS PROVED CHALLENGING DUE TO THE MULTISPECIES NATURE OF CATCHES AND THE DIVERSITY OF FISH FUNCTIONAL ROLES. WE USED DATA ON FISH COMMUNITIES COLLECTED FROM 233 INDIVIDUAL SITES IN 9 WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN COUNTRIES TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN THE SITE'S FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION AND ASSOCIATED LIFE-HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS ALONG A LARGE RANGE OF FISH BIOMASS. AS BIOMASS INCREASED ALONG THIS RANGE, FISH WERE LARGER AND GREW AND MATURED MORE SLOWLY WHILE THE ABUNDANCE OF SCRAPING AND PREDATORY SPECIES INCREASED. THE GREATEST CHANGES IN FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OCCURRED BELOW RELATIVELY LOW STANDING STOCK BIOMASS (<600 KG/HA); ABUNDANCES OF PISCIVORES, APEX PREDATORS, AND SCRAPING HERBIVORES WERE LOW AT VERY LIGHT LEVELS OF FISHING. THIS SUGGESTS POTENTIAL TRADE-OFFS IN ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION AND ESTIMATED YIELDS FOR DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. CURRENT FISHING GEAR AND AREA RESTRICTIONS ARE NOT ACHIEVING CONSERVATION TARGETS (PROPOSED HERE AS STANDING STOCK BIOMASS OF 1150 KG/HA) AND RESULT IN LOSSES OF LIFE HISTORY AND ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. FISH IN REEFS WHERE DESTRUCTIVE GEARS WERE RESTRICTED TYPICALLY HAD VERY SIMILAR BIOMASS AND FUNCTIONS TO YOUNG AND LOW COMPLIANCE CLOSURES.

WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF A LARGE-SCALE OFFSHORE MPA LOCATED ON THE SOUTHWEST ATLANTIC PATAGONIAN SHELF (43°S 63°W) ON THE DEMERSAL FISH ASSEMBLAGE. COMPLIANCE OF THE PATAGONIAN MPA WAS ASSESSED BY ANALYSING EIGHT YEARS OF SATELLITE VESSEL MONITORING SYSTEM (VMS; 2000–2008) DATA, WHICH SHOWED COMPLIANCE AND FISHING EFFORT CONCENTRATED NEAR THE PROTECTION BOUNDARIES. MPA EFFECTS WERE STUDIED BY EMPLOYING A FIVE YEAR DATABASE COLLECTED BY A SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH VESSEL IN PROTECTED AND FISHING LOCATIONS, BEFORE AND AFTER THE MPA ESTABLISHMENT. WE ASSESSED 152 SCIENTIFIC TRAWLING STATIONS USING MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF FISH ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE, FISH ABUNDANCE (DISCRIMINATING TARGET AND NON-TARGET SPECIES), AND MEAN SIZE AND PROPORTION OF JUVENILES OF THE TARGET SPECIES (ARGENTINE HAKE, MERLUCCIUS HUBBSI). THE IDENTIFIED MPA EFFECTS WERE A TREND TOWARDS INCREASING ABUNDANCE OF THE DEMERSAL FISH ASSEMBLAGE, THE TARGET AND NON-TARGET FISH SPECIES, AND HAKE JUVENILE SIZE, AND A HIGHER PROPORTION OF JUVENILES AGED 2+ INSIDE THE MPA.

ALTHOUGH SHARKS USED LARGE AREAS INSIDE MPAS, MOST INDIVIDUALS TENDED TO USE ONLY HALF OF THE AVAILABLE PROTECTED SPACE. IN ADDITION, ALL SHARKS MADE EXCURSIONS FROM MPAS AND INDIVIDUALS EXITED AND RE-ENTERED AT CONSISTENT LOCATIONS ALONG THE MPA BOUNDARIES. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT MPAS HAVE CONSERVATION BENEFITS FOR SHARK POPULATIONS BY PROVIDING PROTECTION ACROSS DIFFERENT SPECIES AND LIFE STAGES, AND TRACKING STUDIES CAN BE USED TO HELP TAILOR MPA DESIGN TO MAXIMIZE EFFECTIVENESS.

THIS STUDY PRESENTS THE FIRST DISCARD SURVIVAL ESTIMATES ON-BOARD DUTCH COMMERCIAL PULSE TRAWLERS. DURING SEVEN, SIX, AND ONE FISHING TRIP(S), RESPECTIVELY, UNDERSIZED PLAICE (PLEURONECTES PLATESSA), SOLE (SOLEA SOLEA), AND DAB (LIMANDA LIMANDA) WERE COLLECTED, ASSESSED FOR VITALITY AND SUBSEQUENTLY MONITORED UP TO 21 DAYS. UNCORRECTED FOR ANY POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM PREDATION, TAGGING, RESEARCH-RELATED HANDLING, OR HOLDING CONDITIONS OVERALL SURVIVAL FOR PLAICE (N = 349), SOLE (N = 226), AND DAB (N = 187) WAS ASSESSED AS 15% [95% CI: 11–19%], 29% [95% CI: 24–35%], AND 16% [95% CI: 10–26%] RESPECTIVELY. SURVIVAL WAS MAINLY EFFECTED BY WATER TEMPERATURE AND FACTORS LINKED TO THE FISHING VESSEL. FISH LENGTH WAS NOT FOUND TO AFFECT SURVIVAL. CATCH PROCESSING TIME AND HAUL DURATION AFFECTED PLAICE SURVIVAL BUT NOT SOLE. VITALITY INDEX, WHICH AVERAGES REFLEX IMPAIRMENT AND EXTERNAL DAMAGE SCORES, CORRELATED WITH SURVIVAL AND MAY BE DEVELOPED AS A PROXY FOR DISCARD SURVIVAL.

THIS STUDY WAS INITIATED IN RESPONSE TO A SCARCITY OF DATA ON THE EFFICIENCY, SELECTIVITY AND DISCARD MORTALITY OF BAITED TRAPS TO TARGET SCYLLA SERRATA. FIVE REPLICATES OF FOUR TRAPS, INCLUDING “HOOP NETS”, RIGID “WIRE POTS”, AND COLLAPSIBLE “ROUND” AND “RECTANGULAR” POTS WERE DEPLOYED FOR 3, 6 AND 24 H IN TWO AUSTRALIAN ESTUARIES. TRAPPED S. SERRATA WERE “DISCARDED” INTO CAGES AND MONITORED WITH CONTROLS OVER 3 D. ALL S. SERRATA WERE ASSESSED FOR DAMAGE, WHILE SUBSETS OF IMMEDIATELY CAUGHT AND MONITORED INDIVIDUALS HAD HAEMOLYMPH CONSTITUENTS QUANTIFIED AS STRESS INDICES. ALL TRAPS RETAINED SIMILAR-SIZED (8.1–19.1 CM CARAPACE WIDTH) S. SERRATA, WITH CATCHES POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO DEPLOYMENT DURATION. ROUND POTS WERE THE MOST EFFICIENT FOR S. SERRATA AND FISH—MOSTLY ACANTHOPAGRUS AUSTRALIS (3% MORTALITY). HOOP NETS WERE THE LEAST EFFICIENT AND WERE OFTEN DAMAGED. NO S.

BYCATCH, OR THE INCIDENTAL CAPTURE OF NON-TARGET SPECIES, OCCURS IN FISHERIES AROUND THE WORLD, WITH OFTEN DETRIMENTAL ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES. BYCATCH REDUCTION DEVICES (BRDS) THAT INCREASE CATCH SPECIFICITY HAVE BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY IN SOME FISHERIES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH DEVICES REMAINS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE GLOBAL EFFORT TO REDUCE BYCATCH RATES. WE TESTED NOVEL DEVICES DESIGNED TO EXCLUDE JUVENILE ROCKFISH (SEBASTES SPP.) FROM TRAPS USED TO CATCH SPOT PRAWNS (PANDALUS PLATYCEROS), A COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT SPECIES IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA. THE DEVICES INCLUDED REDUCTIONS IN TRAP OPENING SIZES AND NOVEL BENT-TUNNEL OPENINGS. REDUCING TRAP OPENING SIZE DID NOT AFFECT BYCATCH RATES OF ROCKFISH OR OTHER NON-TARGET FISH SPECIES. IN CONTRAST, BENT-TUNNEL BRDS ELIMINATED ROCKFISH BYCATCH, AND TWO OF THE BENT-TUNNEL VARIANTS ALSO EXCLUDED OTHER FISH SPECIES. HOWEVER, PRAWN CATCH RATES WERE REDUCED IN ALL MODIFIED GEAR, AND LARGE PRAWNS WERE OFTEN EXCLUDED MORE THAN SMALL PRAWNS. VIDEOS RECORDED IN SITU REVEALED THAT PRAWN ATTEMPTS TO ENTER TRAPS TOOK LONGER AND WERE MORE LIKELY TO FAIL IN BRD-EQUIPPED THAN IN UNMODIFIED TRAPS. WE CONCLUDE THAT BENT-TUNNEL BRDS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE USEFUL, BUT IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED TO INCREASE PRAWN CATCH TO LEVELS SIMILAR TO THAT OF UNMODIFIED TRAPS.",1

TWELVE TRAWLERS WERE CHALLENGED TO TEST THEIR OWN SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE UNWANTED BYCATCH AND/OR CHOKE SPECIES, WHILE MAINTAINING PROFITABLE. THE PARTICIPATING FISHERS TESTED DIFFERENT OPTIONS DEPENDING ON THEIR FISHERY AND THE TYPE OF ISSUES THEY FACED INDIVIDUALLY, AND ADJUSTED THEIR TEST FISHERY OVER TIME THROUGH INCREMENTAL SMALL STEPS. NINE VESSELS REDUCED DISCARD RATIO IN THE TEST FISHERY, ONE SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TEST AND CONTROL FISHERY, WHILE TWO VESSELS DISPLAYED AN INCREASE IN DISCARD RATIO. CATCH COMPOSITIONS ALSO DIFFERED, WITH FEWER “CHOKE SPECIES” OCCURRING IN THE TEST FISHERIES AND A MORE VALUABLE SIZE COMPOSITION. ULTIMATELY, DESPITE SMALLER LANDINGS IN MULTIPLE VESSELS, NO VESSEL SHOWED REDUCTION IN VALUE-PER-UNIT-EFFORT (VPUE) AND ONE BALTIC VESSEL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE VPUE.

THIS STUDY TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A NOVEL OTTER-BOARD DESIGN, TERMED THE “BATWING” (COMPRISING A 0.1-M WIDE SLED WITH AN OFFSET SAIL AT 20° AOA) WOULD HAVE RELATIVELY FEWER BOTTOM IMPACTS THAN A CONVENTIONAL FLAT-RECTANGULAR OTTER BOARD (35° AOA, WITH A SIMILAR HYDRODYNAMIC SPREADING FORCE). PAIRS OF EACH OTTER BOARD WERE SUSPENDED BENEATH A PURPOSE-BUILT RIG COMPRISING A BEAM AND POSTERIOR SEMI-PELAGIC COLLECTION NET AND REPEATEDLY DEPLOYED ACROSS ESTABLISHED TRAWL GROUNDS IN AN AUSTRALIAN ESTUARY.

THESE RATES WERE SIMILAR TO THE DIFFERENCE IN BASE-PLATE BOTTOM CONTACT (87%). FURTHER, THE BATWING DAMAGED PROPORTIONALLY FEWER DAMAGED SHELLS, ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR DISPLACEMENT AWAY FROM THE BOARD'S SURFACE AREA.

WE FURTHER HYPOTHESIZED THAT, DUE TO THE NON-HERDING NATURE OF NORTHERN SHRIMP (PANDALUS BOREALIS), THE USE OF AN OFF-BOTTOM FLOATING BRIDLE WOULD NOT REDUCE SHRIMP CATCH. THESE HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED IN THE FIELD BY COMPARING A TRAWL WITH REGULAR BOTTOM-TENDERING WIRE BRIDLES AND THE SAME TRAWL WITH FLOATING SYNTHETIC BRIDLES IN THE GULF OF MAINE NORTHERN SHRIMP FISHERY. AS EXPECTED, NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN CATCH RATES AND SIZE WERE FOUND FOR THE TARGETED NORTHERN SHRIMP (146.3 ± 10.58 KG H-1 CONTROL VS. 140.8 ± 9.35 KG H-1, P = 0.13). TOTAL FINFISH BYCATCH WAS REDUCED BY 14.9%, AND THE DIFFERENCE WAS STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT (P = 0.01).

IN THE MIXED-SPECIES BOTTOM-TRAWL FISHERIES OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC CATCHES CAN BE INCREASED BY FITTING A LENGTH OF CHAIN KNOWN AS A “TICKLER” IN FRONT OF THE GROUNDGEAR OF THE TRAWL. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE TICKLER IS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE AT CATCHING SKATES AND RAYS THAT MAY OTHERWISE ESCAPE BENEATH THE NET. A TRIAL WAS UNDERTAKEN WITH PAIRED TOWS WITH AND WITHOUT THE TICKLER CHAIN. THE TRIAL DEMONSTRATED THAT THE CATCH RATE OF SKATES AND SHARKS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED BY REMOVING THE TICKLER. A SET OF SECONDARY NETS (GROUNDGEAR BAGS) ATTACHED BEHIND THE GROUNDGEAR OF THE MAIN NET ALLOWED THE NUMBER OF FISH ESCAPING UNDER THE NET TO BE ESTIMATED AND SHOWED THAT THE REDUCTION OF SKATES AND SHARKS IN THE MAIN NET WAS ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN NUMBER IN THE GROUNDGEAR BAGS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT PROHIBITION OF THE USE OF TICKLER CHAINS IN AREAS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO SKATES AND SHARKS COULD HAVE CONSERVATION BENEFITS. THE REMOVAL OF THE TICKLER CHAIN HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON CATCH RATES OF HADDOCK, WHITING, AND FLATFISH, BUT CAUSED A MARKED DECREASE IN THE CATCH RATE OF COMMERCIALLY VALUABLE ANGLERFISH.",1

TO REDUCE DISCARDS, FRENCH TRAWLERS WERE EQUIPPED WITH A VARIETY OF SELECTIVE DEVICES, FROM 2005 ONWARDS. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THEIR EFFICACY USING DATA FROM THE FRENCH ON-BOARD OBSERVER PROGRAMME, 2003–2010. GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS WERE BUILT FOR CATCHES, DISCARDS, AND LANDINGS OF NEPHROPS AND HAKE, CONTROLLING FOR THE OTHER FACTORS WHICH DRIVE THE VARIABILITY IN THESE VARIABLES. A DORSAL SQUARE-MESH PANEL MEANT TO LET SMALL HAKE ESCAPE DID NOT AFFECT HAKE CATCH, BUT WAS FOUND TO DECREASE NEPHROPS CATCHES AND DISCARDS. AMONG THE DEVICES INTENDED TO REDUCE NEPHROPS DISCARDS, THE FLEXIBLE GRID WAS THE MOST EFFICIENT, AS IT DECREASED CATCHES AND DISCARDS IN LARGE PROPORTIONS WHILE INCREASING LANDINGS BUT THIS RESULT WAS SUPPORTED BY A SMALL NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS; A LARGER MESH SIZE IN THE CODEND (80 MM INSTEAD OF 70) SLIGHTLY DECREASED NEPHROPS DISCARDS; AND A VENTRAL SQUARE-MESH PANEL WAS NOT FOUND TO AFFECT CATCH OR DISCARDS OF EITHER SPECIES.

OUR MAIN FINDINGS REVEAL THAT THE RELEASE EFFICIENCY OF THE SQUARE MESH PANEL IN THE BACOMA CODEND DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE OVERLAP OF THE SQUARE MESH PANEL AND THE CATCH-ACCUMULATION ZONE IN THE CODEND, WHERE COD DO NOT HAVE THE OPTION OF JUST DRIFTING FURTHER BACK IN THE TRAWL WHEN PROXIMATE TO THE PANEL.

THERE ARE FEW, IF ANY, STUDIES THAT HAVE DETERMINED MITIGATION PERFORMANCES OF BRDS FROM SUBSURFACE INTERACTIONS FOR THESE SPECIES, AS MOST ARE RARELY ENCOUNTERED AND THUS REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS OF OBSERVER COVERAGE FOR ROBUST ASSESSMENTS.

HABITAT FRAGMENTATION AFFECTS BATS DURING THEIR DAILY MOVEMENTS BETWEEN ROOSTS AND FORAGING AREAS. AS BATS ARE PROTECTED IN EUROPE, DEVELOPERS MUST IMPLEMENT SPECIFIC MITIGATION MEASURES THAT ARE HIERARCHICALLY STRUCTURED TO ACHIEVE A NULL NET IMPACT. HOWEVER, VERY FEW SPECIFIC MITIGATION MEASURES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN SPECIFICALLY FOR BATS. BAT OVERPASSES (E.G. GANTRIES) ARE AMONG PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS INTENDED TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF ROADS, BUT THEY HAVE RARELY BEEN TESTED. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OVERPASSES IN FACILITATING SAFE ROAD CROSSING OF BATS IS CRITICAL FOR JUSTIFYING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS MITIGATION MEASURE. WE THEREFORE ASSESSED WHETHER BAT OVERPASSES ARE EFFECTIVELY USED BY BATS. WE STUDIED THREE BAT OVERPASSES WITH DIFFERENT DESIGNS IN FRANCE. WE DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE METHOD TO CHARACTERIZE BAT CROSSINGS USING ACOUSTIC FLIGHT PATH RECONSTRUCTION (AFPR). WE USED SIX PAIRS OF STEREO ACOUSTIC RECORDERS IN DIFFERENT HABITAT TYPES THAT WERE LOCATED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD, AND OPERATED SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. RECORDING DATA CONTAINED 57,941 BAT PASSES AND 284 BAT CROSSINGS FROM SIX SPECIES OF BATS AT THE THREE STUDY SITES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CROSSINGS ARE MORE NUMEROUS IF AN OVERPASS IS LOCATED WHERE BAT COMMUTING ROUTES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT. HOWEVER, WE FOUND THAT THE PROPORTION OF BAT CROSSINGS ALONG THE COMMUTING ROUTE WAS THE SAME WITH OR WITHOUT AN OVERPASS; THUS HIGHLIGHTING THAT BAT OVERPASSES DO NOT FULLY RESTORE HABITAT CONNECTIVITY.

FRUIT YIELD FROM PANICLES THAT WERE PROTECTED FROM DEPREDATION BY NYLON NETTING WAS APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD GREATER THAN THAT FROM UNPROTECTED PANICLES. WE SUSPECT THAT FRUIT BATS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 42% OF THE TOTAL DAMAGE BUT ILLUSTRATE THE DIFFICULTIES IN ATTRIBUTING DAMAGE TO A SINGLE CAUSE IN SUCH ASSESSMENTS. ALTHOUGH WE DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF PROTECTIVE NETTING, WE RECOGNIZE THAT BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTATION EXIST AND THAT A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT INCORPORATES CROP PROTECTION, FOREST RESTORATION STRATEGIES AND ADDRESSES NEGATIVE PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARDS BATS IN GENERAL IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE THE PERSISTENCE OF THIS ENDEMIC SPECIES.",1

RECENT FISHING ACTIVITY AND THE PHASE OF THE TRAWL OPERATION SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED INTERACTION RATES; INTERACTIONS INCREASED WITH THE AMOUNT OF RECENT TRAWL ACTIVITY AND WERE HIGHEST WHILE THE TRAWL WAS BEING SET. MOST SEALS ACCESSED THE TRAWL VIA THE NET ENTRANCE AND EXITED VIA AN ESCAPE OPENING LOCATED AT THE BASE OF THE SED. THE SIZE OF THE ESCAPE OPENING WAS THE ONLY OPERATIONAL FACTOR THAT INFLUENCED MORTALITY RATES — SIMPLY ENLARGING THE ESCAPE HOLE REDUCED LETHAL INTERACTIONS BY 79%.

TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF USING TRANSLOCATIONS TO MITIGATE REDUCED PREY AVAILABILITY, 12 WEANLING MONK SEALS WERE TRANSLOCATED WITH PRE-RELEASE HEALTH SCREENING AND POST-RELEASE MONITORING. SPECIFICALLY, THE HEALTH, FORAGING BEHAVIOR, HABITAT USE, AND SURVIVAL OF TRANSLOCATED SEALS WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF 17 MONK SEALS RESIDENT TO THE RELEASE SITE. THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN TRANSLOCATED AND RESIDENT SEALS, ALTHOUGH CHLAMYDOPHILA ABORTUS ANTIBODIES AND ENTERIC BACTERIA WERE DETECTED IN MANY INDIVIDUALS. TRANSLOCATED AND RESIDENT WEANLING SEALS ALSO DEMONSTRATED SIMILAR DIVING, MOVEMENTS, AND HABITAT USE, WHEREAS RESIDENT ADULT SEALS HAD GREATER VARIABILITY IN FORAGING PATTERNS. FIRST-YEAR SURVIVAL FOR TRANSLOCATED WEANLINGS (50\%, N = 12) AND NON-TRANSLOCATED WEANLINGS AT THE DONOR (31\%, N = 36) AND RECIPIENT SITES (69\%, N = 16) WAS RELATED TO WEANING BODY SIZE, WITH LARGER INDIVIDUALS HAVING GREATER SURVIVORSHIP. THESE RESULTS SUPPORTED 3 MAIN CONCLUSIONS THAT HAVE IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES FOR FUTURE TRANSLOCATION AND POPULATION RECOVERY EFFORTS: (1) THERE WAS MINIMAL RISK OF EXPOSING SEALS TO NOVEL INFECTIOUS DISEASES AS A RESULT OF TRANSLOCATION; (2) INDIVIDUALS TRANSLOCATED WITH LIMITED FORAGING EXPERIENCE RAPIDLY ADAPTED TO THEIR POST-RELEASE ENVIRONMENT; AND (3) TRANSLOCATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF MITIGATING PREY LIMITATION IS A VIABLE AND IMPORTANT CONSERVATION TOOL FOR HAWAIIAN MONK SEALS.",1

LEPTOSPIRURIA WAS ASSESSED BY REAL-TIME PCR OF URINE AND URINE CULTURE, WITH PERSISTENCE ASSESSED USING LONGITUDINALLY COLLECTED SAMPLES. SERUM CHEMISTRY WAS USED TO ASSESS RECOVERY OF NORMAL RENAL FUNCTION.

ALL URINE CULTURES WERE NEGATIVE; THEREFORE, THE PRESENCE OF LEPTOSPIRURIA WAS ASSESSED USING PCR. LEPTOSPIRURIA CONTINUED BEYOND THE INITIAL COURSE OF PENICILLIN FAMILY ANTIBIOTICS IN 13 OF THE 14 SEA LIONS, BEYOND THE LAST ANTIBIOTIC DOSE IN 11 OF THE 14 SEA LIONS, BEYOND RECOVERY OF RENAL FUNCTION IN 13 OF THE 14 SEA LIONS, AND PERSISTED FOR AT LEAST 8 TO 86 D (MEDIAN = 45; MEAN = 46.8). FIVE ANIMALS WERE RELEASED WITH NO NEGATIVE URINE PCR RESULTS DETECTED; THUS, THEIR TOTAL SHEDDING DURATION MAY HAVE BEEN LONGER. CESSATION OF LEPTOSPIRURIA WAS MORE LIKELY IN ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED ANTIBIOTICS FOR A GREATER DURATION, ESPECIALLY IF COVERAGE WAS UNINTERRUPTED. REAL-TIME PCR RESULTS INDICATE THAT AN ANTIBIOTIC PROTOCOL COMMONLY USED TO TREAT LEPTOSPIROSIS IN REHABILITATING CALIFORNIA SEA LIONS DOES NOT ELIMINATE LEPTOSPIRURIA. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ANTIBIOTIC PROTOCOLS GIVEN FOR A LONGER DURATION AND/OR INCLUDING OTHER ANTIBIOTICS MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN ELIMINATING LEPTOSPIRURIA.

IN-SITU OBSERVATIONS USING VIDEO AT INCREASING DISTANCES FROM THE NET OPENING DURING 50 COMMERCIAL FISH TRAWLS, RECORDED 5908 COMMON BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN (TURSIOPS TRUNCATUS (MONTAGU, 1821)) INTERACTIONS AND PROVIDED DETAILS ON THEIR DURATION, DEPREDATION RATES, AND BEHAVIOURS. DOLPHIN INTERACTIONS WITH TRAWLS WERE VERY COMMON (98% OF DAY-TRAWLS, 118 ± 16 INTERACTIONS PER TRAWL), WITH DURATIONS AND PREY CONSUMPTION POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE DISTANCES VENTURED INTO THE NET. ACOUSTIC DETERRENTS (PINGERS) HAD NO EFFECT ON INTERACTION NUMBERS OR DURATIONS. BASED ON IN-SITU OBSERVATIONS, THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TOWARD DOLPHIN BYCATCH IN DEMERSAL FISH TRAWLS WERE LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH (I) RISKY DOLPHIN BEHAVIOUR (I.E., ENTERING NET DURING HAULING, RESIDING DEEP WITHIN TRAWL FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OR SOCIAL AGGRESSION) AND (OR) (II) INSTABILITY OF FISHING GEAR RESULTING IN ENTRAPMENT. GIVEN THE HIGH LEVEL OF DOLPHIN ATTENDANCE DURING MOST DAY-TRAWLS, MITIGATION STRATEGIES THAT FOCUS ON IMPROVING AND MONITORING THE STABILITY OF TRAWL GEAR WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN CURRENT ACOUSTIC DETERRENT DEVICES AIMED AT MODIFYING DOLPHIN BEHAVIOUR.",1

DURING FEAR CONDITIONING, INDIVIDUALS LEARN THE CUES THAT PRECEDE THE DANGEROUS STIMULI, AND RESPOND BY AVOIDING THE PAINFUL SITUATIONS. WE TESTED THE EFFICACY OF FEAR CONDITIONING USING ACOUSTIC STIMULI FOR REDUCING CALIFORNIA SEA LION ZALOPHUS CALIFORNIANUS INTERACTIONS FROM TWO FISHING CONTEXTS IN CALIFORNIA, USA; BAIT BARGES AND RECREATIONAL FISHING VESSELS. WE PERFORMED CONDITIONING TRIALS ON 24 INDIVIDUAL SEA LIONS INTERACTING WITH BAIT BARGES. WE TESTED FOR ACQUISITION OF CONDITIONED FEAR BY PAIRING A NEUTRAL TONE WITH A STARTLE STIMULUS. AVOIDANCE WAS STRONGEST IN RESPONSE TO THE STARTLE STIMULUS ALONE, BUT LOW WHEN PAIRED WITH A NEUTRAL TONE. FROM ACTIVELY FISHING VESSELS, WE TESTED FOR FEAR CONDITIONING BY EXPOSING SEA LIONS TO A NEUTRAL TONE FOLLOWED BY A STARTLE PULSE, A STARTLE PULSE ALONE OR A NO SOUND CONTROL. WE CONDUCTED PLAYBACKS FROM 146 (INCLUDING 48 NO SOUND CONTROL) STOPS OVER TWO SUMMER FISHING SEASONS (2013, 2014). THE STARTLE STIMULUS DECREASED SURFACING FREQUENCY, REDUCED BAIT FORAGING AND INCREASED SURFACING DISTANCE FROM THE VESSEL WHILE THE CONDITIONED STIMULUS ONLY CAUSED A MILD REDUCTION IN SURFACING FREQUENCY WITH NO OTHER BEHAVIORAL CHANGE. EXPOSING ANIMALS TO A PAIR OF A CONDITIONED STIMULUS WITH A STARTLE PULSE DID NOT ACHIEVE THE INTENDED MANAGEMENT OUTCOME. RATHER, IT GENERATED EVIDENCE (IN TWO STUDY CONTEXTS) OF IMMEDIATE LEARNING THAT LED TO THE REDUCTION OF THE UNCONDITIONED RESPONSE.

BEAKED WHALES HAVE NOT BEEN OBSERVED ENTANGLED IN THIS FISHERY SINCE 1995, THE LAST FULL YEAR OF FISHING WITHOUT ACOUSTIC PINGERS. PINGER FAILURE (=1 NONFUNCTIONING PINGERS IN A NET) WAS NOTED IN 3.7% OF OBSERVED SETS. IN SETS WHERE THE NUMBER OF FAILED PINGERS WAS RECORDED, APPROXIMATELY 18% OF DEPLOYED PINGERS HAD FAILED.

BYCATCH RATES OF CALIFORNIA SEA LIONS IN SETS WITH =30 PINGERS WERE NEARLY DOUBLE THAT OF SETS WITHOUT PINGERS, WHICH PROMPTED US TO EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL “DINNER BELL” EFFECTS OF PINGERS. DEPREDATION OF SWORDFISH CATCH BY CALIFORNIA SEA LIONS WAS NOT LINKED TO PINGER USE—THE BEST PREDICTORS OF DEPREDATION WERE TOTAL SWORDFISH CATCH, MONTH FISHED, AREA FISHED, AND NIGHTTIME USE OF DECK LIGHTS ON VESSELS.",1

NON-LETHAL MANAGEMENT TOOLS SUCH AS ACOUSTIC DEVICES SHOW HIGHLY VARYING SUCCESS AND OFTEN POSE A CONSERVATION RISK DUE TO NOISE POLLUTION AND HABITAT DEGRADATION. WE TESTED THE LONG-TERM EFFECTIVENESS OF A DETERRENCE SYSTEM WHICH HARNESSES AN AUTONOMOUS REFLEX (STARTLE) TO SELECTIVELY INFLICT AVOIDANCE RESPONSES IN A TARGET SPECIES (PHOCID SEALS) BY EMITTING BAND-LIMITED NOISE PULSES WITH SHARP ONSET TIMES. SEAL PREDATION WAS MONITORED AT A MARINE SALMON FARM (TEST SITE) OVER A FULL PRODUCTION CYCLE (19 MONTH) WITH A MULTITRANSDUCER DETERRENT SYSTEM DEPLOYED FOR THE FINAL YEAR. PREDATION WAS ALSO MONITORED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AT TWO CONTROL SITES AND ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT AT SITES WHICH SUFFERED HIGHER PREDATION RATES. GENERALIZED LINEAR (MIXED) MODELS REVEALED THAT SOUND EXPOSURE CAUSED A 91\% REDUCTION IN LOST FISH WHEN COMPARING PREDATION LEVELS WITHIN THE TEST SITE AND 97\% WHEN COMPARING THE TEST SITE AGAINST BOTH CONTROL SITES. SIMILARLY, SOUND EXPOSURE LED TO A 93\% REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF FISH LOST DUE TO SEAL DAMAGE AT A SHORT-TERM TEST SITE. VISUAL MONITORING OF MARINE MAMMALS AROUND THE LONG-TERM TEST SITE SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF SEAL SURFACINGS WITHIN 100 M FROM THE LOUDSPEAKERS WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY LOWER DURING SOUND EXPOSURE. HARBOUR PORPOISE AND OTTER DISTRIBUTION AROUND THE FARM WAS NOT AFFECTED BY SOUND EXPOSURE. BY ADJUSTING THE FREQUENCY COMPOSITION OF STARTLE STIMULI, OUR METHOD HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR MANAGING HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICTS IN TERRESTRIAL AND MARINE HABITATS BY SELECTIVELY DETERRING TARGET SPECIES.",1

BOTH DATASETS INDICATED THAT DOLPHINS WERE CAUGHT IN ALL FISHERY AREAS, ACROSS ALL DEPTHS AND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. OVER THE ENTIRE DATASETS, OBSERVER REPORTED BYCATCH RATES (N&#X200A;=&#X200A;52 DOLPHINS IN 4,124 TRAWLS, OR 12.6 DOLPHINS/1,000 TRAWLS) WERE CA.

MOREOVER, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE CONTEXT ON BATS AS WE EXPECTED THAT HIGHLY MOBILE SPECIES WOULD BENEFIT FURTHER FROM LANDSCAPE-SCALE MANAGEMENT.

PIPISTRELLE BATS) WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY TIME SINCE LAST TRIMMING. CHANGES IN TRIMMING REGIME STRONGLY AFFECTED HEDGEROW HEIGHT WHICH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY (BY INCREASING PREY ABUNDANCE) INFLUENCED BAT OCCURRENCE, ACTIVITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS ALONG HEDGEROWS. THE ACTIVITY OF HIGHLY MOBILE BAT SPECIES WAS MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH A RANGE OF LANDSCAPE ATTRIBUTES. THE AMOUNT OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND WITHIN 0.5 KM OF THE SAMPLING SITES POSITIVELY INFLUENCED R.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TARGETED AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES CAN INCLUDE EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO ENHANCE BATS AND THEIR INSECT PREY IN FARMLAND. ALTHOUGH WE HIGHLIGHT THE SUCCESS OF CURRENT PRESCRIPTIONS ON HEDGEROW MANAGEMENT, WE SUGGEST THAT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS CAN EASILY BE OPTIMIZED BY ENCOURAGING FARMERS TO KEEP HEDGEROWS UNTRIMMED FOR LONGER PERIODS (>3 UP TO 10 YEARS).

WEDETERMINED THE INFLUENCE OF FIRE ON WILDLIFE, BY QUANTIFYING REPTILE ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION IN RESPONSE TO FIRE IN A WEEDY ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERISED BY VERY SHORT-TERM FIRE RETURN INTERVALS (< 2 YEARS). WE USED REPTILES BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN UNDERSTUDIED, AND ARE ONLY MODERATELY VAGILE COMPARED TO OTHER VERTEBRATES, AND THEY RESPOND STRONGLY TO CHANGES IN VEGETATION STRUCTURE. WE REPEATEDLY SAMPLED 24 REPLICATE SAMPLING SITES AFTER THEY HAD BEEN UNBURNED FOR TWO YEARS, JUST PRIOR TO BURNING (PREBURNT), JUST AFTER BURNING (POST-BURNT), AND UP TO 15 MONTHS AFTER BURNING (REVEGETATED) AND MONITORED VEGETATION STRUCTURE AND REPTILE RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE AND ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION. OUR SITES WERE NOT SPATIALLY AUTO-CORRELATED, AND WERE COVERED BY NATIVE KANGAROO GRASS (THEMEDA TRIANDRA), BLACK SPEAR GRASS (HETEROPOGON CONTORTUS), OR AN INVASIVE WEED (GRADER GRASS, THEMEDA QUADRIVALVIS). REPTILE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS WERE HIGHEST WHEN SITES HAD BEEN UNBURNED FOR 2 YEARS, AND GREATLY REDUCED IN ALL AREAS POST BURNING. THE LOWEST REPTILE ABUNDANCES OCCURRED IN SITES DOMINATED BY THE WEED. REPTILE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS HAD RECOVERED IN ALL GRASS TYPES 15 MONTHS AFTER BURNING, BUT ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION CHANGED. SOME SPECIES WERE PRESENT ONLY IN BEFORE OUR FOCUS FIRE IN NATIVE GRASS, AND THEIR POPULATIONS DID NOT RECOVER EVEN 15 MONTHS POST-BURNING. EVEN IN FIREPRONE, OFTEN-BURNT HABITATS SUCH AS OUR STUDY SITES, IN WHICH FAUNAL RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WERE NOT STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY FIRE, REPTILE ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION WAS ALTERED.

HOWEVER, THESE ACTIVITIES CHANGE LOCAL CLIMATE, AND THIS, IN TURN, ALTER THE COMPOSITION OF NATURAL COMMUNITIES. THE EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES MAY BE GREATER IN THOSE TAXONOMIC GROUPS WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY TO HABITAT DISTURBANCE, SUCH AS AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES, WHICH ARE THE UNIQUE TERRESTRIAL ECTOTHERMIC VERTEBRATES. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCES IN DIVERSITY OF AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES IN A TEMPERATE FOREST UNDER TWO SILVICULTURAL TREATMENTS, ONE OF LOW AND THE OTHER OF HIGH INTENSITY, AS WELL AS FROM ONE, FIVE AND TEN YEARS OF REGENERATION SINCE THE LAST LOGGING EVENT, SIERRA SUR OF OAXACA, MEXICO. RECORDS OF 21 SPECIES OF HERPETOFAUNA (SIX AMPHIBIANS AND 15 REPTILES) WERE OBTAINED. THE TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS WAS SIMILAR IN BOTH TREATMENTS; HOWEVER, THE COMPOSITION VARIED BETWEEN SITES WITH DIFFERENT RECOVERY TIMES. HIGHER ABUNDANCE OF AMPHIBIAN WAS PRESENTED ON SITES WITH THE LOW-INTENSITY TREATMENT, WHILE REPTILES WERE MORE ABUNDANT AT SITES WITH INTENSIVE TREATMENT. COMPARED TO A MATURE FOREST WITHOUT MANAGEMENT, SITES WITH INTENSIVE TREATMENT HAVE MORE RARE SPECIES, ALTHOUGH THE VALUES OF TRUE DIVERSITY OF AMPHIBIANS WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN TREATMENTS WITH DIFFERENT INTENSITIES, WHILE FOR REPTILES SITES UNDER TREATMENT SHOWED LESS DIVERSITY THAT UNMANAGED SITE: 33 % FOR INTENSIVE TREATMENT AND 28 % AT SITES WITH LOW INTENSITY WITH RESPECT TO ONE CONTROL SITE. COMPLEMENTARY ANALYSIS SHOWED A DIFFERENCE OF 86 % BETWEEN THE COMPOSITIONS OF SPECIES IN SITES WITH INTENSIVE TREATMENT. THE TREATMENT INTENSITY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SPECIES, BUT THE WAY THEY RESPOND TO CHANGES IN HABITAT DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH SPECIES AND ITS ABILITY TO ADAPT TO NEW CONDITIONS.",1

IN NEWLY ESTABLISHED POPULATIONS, SUCH AS WHEN ANIMALS ARE TRANSLOCATED FOR CONSERVATION, DISPERSAL AND AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES INFLUENCE PATTERNS OF ABUNDANCE. WE DEVELOPED A PROCESS TO ESTIMATE POPULATION SIZE USING N-MIXTURE MODELS AND SPATIAL MODELS FOR NEWLY ESTABLISHED AND DISPERSING POPULATIONS. WE USED OUR APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE POPULATION SIZE OF CRITICALLY ENDANGERED ST. CROIX GROUND LIZARDS (AMEIVA POLOPS) FIVE YEARS AFTER TRANSLOCATION OF 57 INDIVIDUALS TO BUCK ISLAND, AN OFFSHORE ISLAND OF ST. CROIX, UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS. ESTIMATES OF POPULATION SIZE INCORPORATED ABIOTIC VARIABLES, DISPERSAL LIMITS, AND OPERATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE AVAILABLE TO THE LIZARDS TO ACCOUNT FOR LOW SPECIES DETECTION. OPERATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE AND DISTANCE FROM THE TRANSLOCATION SITE WERE ALWAYS IMPORTANT IN FITTING THE N-MIXTURE MODEL INDICATING EFFECTS OF DISPERSAL AND SPECIES BIOLOGY ON ESTIMATES OF POPULATION SIZE. WE FOUND THAT THE POPULATION IS INCREASING ITS RANGE ACROSS THE ISLAND BY 5-10% EVERY SIX MONTHS. WE SPATIALLY INTERPOLATED SITE-SPECIFIC ABUNDANCE FROM THE N-MIXTURE MODEL TO THE ENTIRE ISLAND, AND WE ESTIMATED 1,473 (95% CI, 940-1,802) ST. CROIX GROUND LIZARDS ON BUCK ISLAND IN 2013 CORRESPONDING TO SURVEY RESULTS. THIS REPRESENTS A 26-FOLD INCREASE SINCE THE TRANSLOCATION. WE PREDICTED THE FUTURE DISPERSAL OF THE LIZARDS TO ALL HABITATS ON BUCK ISLAND, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR THE POPULATION TO INCREASE BY ANOTHER FIVE TIMES IN THE FUTURE. INCORPORATING BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT COVARIATES AS EXPLICIT PARAMETERS IN POPULATION MODELS CAN IMPROVE PREDICTIONS OF POPULATION SIZE AND THE FUTURE SPREAD OF SPECIES INTRODUCED TO NEW LOCALITIES.",2

REHABILITATION HAS SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL COSTS, HOWEVER, AND THUS IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE SUCCESS RATES OF THESE POTENTIAL CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT ACTIONS. WE QUANTIFIED THE SUCCESS RATES FOR 1700 SEA TURTLES ADMITTED TO REHABILITATION FACILITIES IN FLORIDA (USA) BETWEEN 1986 AND 2004. REHABILITATION SUCCESS WAS LOW: 61.5\% OF TURTLES DIED IN REHABILITATION AND ONLY 36.8\% WERE RELEASED BACK INTO THE WILD. A FURTHER 1.6\% OF TURTLES WERE MAINTAINED IN CAPTIVITY PERMANENTLY DUE TO THE SEVERE NATURE OF THEIR INJURIES. MOST MORTALITY OCCURRED EARLY DURING THE REHABILITATION PROCESS (WITHIN A FEW WEEKS), AND SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION OFTEN TOOK SEVERAL MONTHS TO MORE THAN 3 YR. LOGGERHEAD TURTLES CARETTA CARETTA WERE MOST LIKELY TO SURVIVE REHABILITATION, FOLLOWED BY KEMP'S RIDLEYS LEPIDOCHELYS KEMPII AND GREEN TURTLES CHELONIA MYDAS; FOR ALL 3 SPECIES, LARGER INDIVIDUALS HAD AN INCREASED CHANCE OF SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION. AT FACE VALUE, THE LOW RATES OF REHABILITATED TURTLES SUCCESSFULLY RELEASED BACK INTO THE WILD MAY CONTRIBUTE ONLY MODESTLY TO CONSERVATION IN TERMS OF CONTRIBUTING TO POPULATION VIABILITY.

WE USED CAPTURE-RECAPTURE MODELING TO ANALYZE THE ADULT APPARENT SURVIVAL OF RELEASED AND RESIDENT TORTOISES IN TWO TRANSLOCATION PROJECTS IN SPAIN MONITORED FOR 14 AND 29 YEARS. WE TESTED IF LONG-TERM SURVIVAL RATES DIFFER BETWEEN RELEASED AND RESIDENT INDIVIDUALS, IF SURVIVAL WAS LOWER DURING THE PHASE OF ESTABLISHMENT (I.E. RELEASE COST), HOW LONG ACCLIMATION LASTS AND IF INCREASED DENSITY DUE TO RELEASES AFFECTS SURVIVAL. WE FOUND LOWER SURVIVAL OF RELEASED TORTOISES DURING THE PHASE OF ESTABLISHMENT (1 TO 3 YEARS) WHEN RESIDENTS WERE ALREADY PRESENT. AFTER ESTABLISHMENT, SURVIVAL WAS VERY HIGH AND UNAFFECTED BY DENSITY-DEPENDENCE. BODY CONDITION BEFORE RELEASE WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN RECAPTURED AND DEAD/MISSING TORTOISES, AND DID NOT PREDICT ESTABLISHMENT SURVIVAL. STOCHASTIC POPULATION VIABILITY ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT SUCCESS WHEN RELEASING SMALL NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS STRONGLY DEPENDS UPON ADULT LONG-TERM SURVIVAL. RELEASE OF SMALL SECOND BATCHES OF TORTOISES WAS NOT SENSITIVE TO A GROWING POPULATION, REGARDLESS OF ITS RELEASE TIMING. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT LONG-TERM SURVIVAL AS CRUCIAL IN TRANSLOCATION PROJECTS OF LONG-LIVED SPECIES, INVALIDATING SHORT-TERM (FIRST YEAR) SURVIVAL ASSESSMENT, WHEN SURVIVAL RELEASE COST DOES NOT MATCH LONG-TERM SURVIVAL. A RELEASE COST OF DIFFERENT DURATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN MODEL ESTIMATION BEFORE MODELING PREDICTIONS. RELEASING TORTOISES (FOR WELFARE OF CAPTIVE INDIVIDUALS OR FOR MITIGATING HUMAN NEGATIVE IMPACTS) IN AN ALREADY ESTABLISHED POPULATION IS NOT RECOMMENDED UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES.

CONTINUED RAPID GROWTH OF SUBURBAN AREAS HAS ACCELERATED THIS SHIFT IN HABITAT QUALITY. MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT PROMOTE SHRUB HABITAT WITHIN DEVELOPED AREAS ARE RARELY GREETED WITH PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE BECAUSE BUSHY THICKETS (E.G.

WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT IN A HEAVILY IMPACTED SUBURBAN HABITAT (POPULATION DENSITY OF SIMILAR TO 2700 HUMANS/KM(2)). OUR STUDY SITE, CONTAINING FOREST AND MEADOW HABITATS, WAS ADJACENT TO A LARGE CITY (SIMILAR TO 320,000 INHABITANTS) AND VISITED BY >70,000 PEOPLE ANNUALLY. WE MANIPULATED THE FOREST HABITAT BY REMOVING TREES, AND THROUGH ACTIVE MAINTENANCE, THEREBY PROMOTING THE GROWTH OF BRAMBLES.

THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE THE LIMITED QUANTITY OF RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON ANIMAL REINTRODUCTIONS HAS SHOWN VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS IN ESTABLISHING NEW POPULATIONS. THE REASONS WHY SOME REINTRODUCTIONS ARE SUCCESSFUL, WHEREAS OTHERS ARE NOT, ARE OFTEN NOT CLEAR. AIMS THE PRESENT RESEARCH AIMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER REPTILE REINTRODUCTION INTO RESTORED MINE PITS IS A POTENTIAL MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE FOR MANAGING AND CONSERVING REPTILE POPULATIONS WITHIN A MINED LANDSCAPE. METHODS TWELVE NAPOLEON’S SKINKS WERE TRAPPED THEN FITTED WITH 0.9-G TRANSMITTERS. HALF WERE REINTRODUCED INTO 5-YEAR-OLD RESTORED MINE PITS AND THE OTHER HALF INTO UNMINED FOREST. BODYWEIGHTS, MOVEMENT PATTERNS AND MACRO-HABITAT SELECTION WERE RECORDED WEEKLY DURING NOVEMBER AND THEN MONTHLY UNTIL MARCH. KEY RESULTS SKINKS REINTRODUCED INTO RESTORED SITES QUICKLY MOVED INTO UNMINED FOREST. BOTH GROUPS OF SKINKS MOVED LARGE DISTANCES, BUT THOSE REINTRODUCED INTO RESTORED SITES TRAVELLED FURTHER THAN DID CONTROL SKINKS AND TOOK LONGER TO REDUCE THEIR DISTANCES TRAVELLED, SHOWING POSSIBLE STRESS AS A RESULT OF RELEASE INTO UNSUITABLE HABITAT. EVENTUALLY, ALMOST ALL SKINKS FOUND SUITABLE HABITAT IN UNMINED FOREST AND SETTLED INTO THESE AREAS WHILE CONTINUING TO GAIN WEIGHT. CONCLUSIONS REINTRODUCTION WAS AN INEFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE FOR FACILITATING COLONISATION OF RESTORED MINESITES BY NAPOLEON’S SKINK. LACK OF SUITABLE MICRO-HABITATS WITHIN RESTORATION AREAS, SUCH AS GROUND LOGS AND COARSE, WOODY DEBRIS PILES, IS LIKELY LIMITING THE USE OF THESE AREAS BY NAPOLEON’S SKINKS AND IS LIKELY TO BE THE CAUSE OF THEIR FAILURE TO REMAIN OR SETTLE IN RESTORED SITES AFTER REINTRODUCTION.

THE GOALS OF OUR STUDY WERE TO USE LONG-TERM DATA TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ECOPASSAGES AND BARRIER FENCING IN REDUCING MASSASAUGA FATALITIES ON ROADS, AND TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL OF THESE STRUCTURES TO SERVE AS MOVEMENT CORRIDORS FOR INDIVIDUAL SNAKES. METHODS WE USED FIVE APPROACHES TO ASSESS THE OVERALL EFFICACY OF MITIGATION EFFORTS: (1) COMPARISON OF PRE- AND POST-MITIGATION ROAD MORTALITY; (2) CAMERA TRAPS IN ECOPASSAGES TO DOCUMENT MASSASAUGA AND PREDATOR PRESENCE; (3) AUTOMATED TAG READERS IN ECOPASSAGE ENTRANCES TO DETECT PIT-TAGGED INDIVIDUALS; (4) AN EXPERIMENT TO ASSESS MASSASAUGA WILLINGNESS TO ENTER AND TRAVEL THROUGH ECOPASSAGES; AND (5) MEASUREMENT OF TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS IN ECOPASSAGES TO ASSESS THERMAL SUITABILITY FOR MASSASAUGAS.

WE PRESENT A CASE STUDY OF THIS PROGRAMME, WHICH HAS TRANSITIONED FROM OUTSIDE AGENCIES MANAGING THE HARVEST, TO COMPLETE LOCAL OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT. EGG HARVESTS AND INCUBATION SUCCESS RATES DECLINED BY 40% FOLLOWING THE SWITCH TO LOCAL MANAGEMENT. INCOME INCREASED, AS DID PRODUCTION COSTS; IN PARTICULAR, ROYALTY PAYMENTS MADE TO INDIGENOUS LANDOWNERS. THE DECLINES REFLECT THE COMMUNITY'S MOTIVES FOR ENGAGING IN THE INDUSTRY, WHICH HAVE BEEN SOCIALLY RATHER THAN COMMERCIALLY DRIVEN, AND DAMAGE TO NESTING HABITAT BY FERAL ANIMALS. THE INCREASE IN ROYALTIES REFLECTS THE NEED TO COMPETE WITH NON-INDIGENOUS HARVESTERS FROM OUTSIDE THE TOWNSHIP, WHO ARE STRICTLY COMMERCIALLY DRIVEN. HARVESTING, INCUBATION AND TRADE IN CROCODILE EGGS AND HATCHLINGS CAN FORM A VIABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENTERPRISE FOR REMOTE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, EFFICIENCY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED TO FULFIL THE NEED FOR A RELIABLE AND DEPENDABLE SUPPLY CHAIN, AND REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS SHOULD GIVE INDIGENOUS HARVESTERS SUFFICIENT FREEDOM TO PURSUE INNOVATIVE AND VIABLE LIVELIHOOD OPTIONS.",2

EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT LONGER TIME IN CAPTIVITY MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT AN ANIMAL’S POST-RELEASE BEHAVIOUR AND SURVIVAL. HOWEVER, ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT MAY REDUCE THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF CAPTIVITY FOR ANIMALS THAT ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED INTO THE WILD. AIMS THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO COMPARE FIRST-YEAR POST-RELEASE SURVIVAL AND BEHAVIOUR OF TRANSLOCATED RATSNAKES (PANTHEROPHIS OBSOLETUS) HELD CAPTIVE FOR VARYING DURATIONS (1–7 YEARS) EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT ENRICHMENT, WITH THAT OF RESIDENT AND WILD-TO-WILD (W–W)-TRANSLOCATED RATSNAKES. KEY RESULTS BEING IN CAPTIVITY BEFORE RELEASE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED SURVIVAL; 11 OF 19 (57.9%) CAPTIVE SNAKES DIED OR WERE REMOVED FROM THE STUDY WITHIN 12 MONTHS, COMPARED WITH 3 OF 11 (27.3%) RESIDENT SNAKES AND NONE OF FIVE (0%) W–W SNAKES. FURTHERMORE, SURVIVAL PROBABILITY DECLINED THE LONGER A SNAKE HAD BEEN IN CAPTIVITY. SIX OF THE SEVEN SNAKES (86%) THAT WE RELEASED THAT HAD BEEN IN CAPTIVITY FOR FOUR OR MORE YEARS BEFORE RELEASE DIED DURING THIS STUDY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY WERE ENRICHED OR NOT. ALTHOUGH W–W-TRANSLOCATED RATSNAKES MOVED MORE OFTEN AND FURTHER THAN DID SNAKES IN OTHER GROUPS, THIS DIFFERENCE WAS APPARENT ONLY IN THE FIRST MONTH POST-RELEASE. WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT ABNORMAL MOVEMENT PATTERNS OR WINTER BEHAVIOUR WAS THE CAUSE OF REDUCED SURVIVAL FOR CAPTIVE SNAKES. INSTEAD, OUR DATA SUGGESTED THAT SPENDING TIME IN CAPTIVITY REDUCED CONCEALMENT BEHAVIOUR OF SNAKES, WHICH LIKELY INCREASED THE VULNERABILITY OF SNAKES TO PREDATORS. CAPTIVITY ALSO COMPROMISED THE FORAGING ABILITY OF SOME OF THE SNAKES. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO OVERALL DIFFERENCES IN PERCENTAGE WEIGHT CHANGE AMONG THE FOUR GROUPS, TWO SNAKES (ONE ENRICHED, ONE UNENRICHED) WERE REMOVED FROM THE STUDY BECAUSE OF EXTREME WEIGHT LOSS (>30%). CONCLUSIONS OUR RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT DID NOT OFFSET THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CAPTIVITY ON RATSNAKES AND THAT THE LIKELY MECHANISM RESPONSIBLE FOR LOW SURVIVAL WAS VULNERABILITY TO PREDATORS.

WE ANALYZED THE SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ROAD DRAINAGE ELEMENTS (N&#X202F;=&#X202F;253; MOSTLY CULVERTS) AS POTENTIAL FAUNAL UNDERPASSES, AND MORTALITY DUE TO VEHICLE COLLISIONS IN TWO SEASONS AND ON FOUR RELATIVELY LOW-TRAFFIC ROADS (&LT;5000 CARS/DAY) TRAVERSING OAK RANGELANDS OF WESTERN ANDALUSIA (S SPAIN).

OVERALL FREQUENCIES OF CASUALTIES AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION WERE HIGHLY VARIABLE BOTH WITHIN AND AMONG THESE ROADS. WE OBTAINED AN ESTIMATION OF POTENTIAL PERMEABILITY FOR THE DIFFERENT ROADS.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS HABITAT MANIPULATION MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE HABITAT AND FOOD RESOURCES FOR BOTH POLLINATORS AND PREDATORS.

YET, MANY OF THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH GRAZING LEADS TO CHANGES IN BIODIVERSITY REMAIN UNRESOLVED. ONE REASON IS THAT CONVENTIONAL GRAZING STUDIES OFTEN TARGET BROAD TREATMENTS RATHER THAN SPECIFIC PARAMETERS OF GRAZING (E.G., INTENSITY, DURATION, AND FREQUENCY) OR FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR HISTORICAL GRAZING EFFECTS. WE CONDUCTED A LANDSCAPE-SCALE REPLICATED GRAZING EXPERIMENT (15,000 KM(2), 97 SITES) TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF PAST GRAZING MANAGEMENT AND CURRENT GRAZING REGIMES (INTENSITY, DURATION, AND FREQUENCY) ON A COMMUNITY OF GROUND-DWELLING HERPETOFAUNA (39 SPECIES). WE ANALYZED COMMUNITY VARIABLES (SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION) FOR ALL SPECIES AND BUILT MULTISEASON PATCH-OCCUPANCY MODELS TO PREDICT LOCAL COLONIZATION AND EXTINCTION FOR THE 7 MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES. PAST GRAZING PRACTICES DID NOT INFLUENCE COMMUNITY RICHNESS BUT DID AFFECT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND PATCH COLONIZATION AND EXTINCTION FOR 4 OF 7 SPECIES. PRESENT GRAZING PARAMETERS DID NOT INFLUENCE COMMUNITY RICHNESS OR COMPOSITION, BUT 6 OF THE 7 TARGET SPECIES WERE AFFECTED BY AT LEAST ONE GRAZING PARAMETER. GRAZING FREQUENCY HAD THE MOST CONSISTENT INFLUENCE, POSITIVELY AFFECTING 3 OF 7 SPECIES (INCREASED COLONIZATION OR DECREASED EXTINCTION). PAST GRAZING PRACTICE AFFECTED COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND POPULATION DYNAMICS IN SOME SPECIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT CONSERVATION PLANNERS SHOULD EXAMINE THE DIFFERENT GRAZING HISTORIES OF AN AREA. SPECIES RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO SPECIFIC CURRENT GRAZING PRACTICES; THUS, INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT APPLY A DIVERSITY OF APPROACHES RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON A CHANGE SUCH AS REDUCED GRAZING INTENSITY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. BASED ON OUR FINDINGS, WE SUGGEST THAT DETERMINING FINE-SCALE GRAZING ATTRIBUTES IS ESSENTIAL FOR ADVANCING GRAZING AS A CONSERVATION STRATEGY.",1

THE AIM WAS TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF VEGETATION TYPE, STOCKING RATE AND OTHER LANDSCAPE-SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WERE ON THE PATTERNS RECORDED. SIXTEEN 1-HA SITES WERE ESTABLISHED WITHIN THREE REPLICATED TREATMENTS (MODERATE, HEAVY AND VARIABLE STOCKING RATES). THE SITES WERE SAMPLED IN THE WET AND DRY SEASONS IN 1999–2000 (T0) AND AGAIN IN 2003–04 (T1). ALL PADDOCKS OF THE TREATMENTS WERE BURNT IN 1999. AVERAGE ANNUAL RAINFALL DECLINED MARKEDLY BETWEEN THE TWO SAMPLING PERIODS, WHICH MADE INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA DIFFICULT. A TOTAL OF 127 SPECIES OF VERTEBRATE FAUNA COMPRISING FIVE AMPHIBIAN, 83 BIRD, 27 REPTILE AND 12 MAMMAL SPECIES WERE RECORDED. THERE WAS STRONG SEPARATION IN FAUNAL COMPOSITION FROM T0 TO T1 ALTHOUGH CHANGES IN MEAN COMPOSITIONAL DISSIMILARITY BETWEEN THE GRAZING STOCKING RATE TREATMENTS WERE LESS WELL DEFINED. THERE WAS A RELATIVE CHANGE IN ABUNDANCE OF 24 BIRD, FOUR MAMMAL AND FIVE REPTILE SPECIES FROM T0 TO T1. THE GENERALISED LINEAR MODELLING IDENTIFIED THAT, IN THE T1 DATA, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN THE ABUNDANCE OF 16 SPECIES EXPLAINED BY THE GRAZING AND VEGETATION FACTORS. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT VERTEBRATE FAUNA ASSEMBLAGE DID CHANGE AND THAT THESE CHANGES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE STOCKING RATES, THE VEGETATION TYPES ON THE SITES SURVEYED, THE BURNING OF THE EXPERIMENTAL PADDOCKS AND THE DECREASE IN RAINFALL OVER THE COURSE OF THE TWO SURVEYS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE EXPERIMENT IS SAMPLED AGAIN BUT THAT THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON A RAPID SURVEY OF ABUNDANT TAXA (I.E. BIRDS AND REPTILES) TO ALLOW AN INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF SAMPLING AND REPLICATION OF THE DATA. THIS WOULD HELP TO ARTICULATE MORE CLEARLY THE TRAJECTORY OF VERTEBRATE CHANGE DUE TO THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF STOCKING RATES COMPARED WITH WIDER LANDSCAPE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES.

RESPONSE VARIABLES WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER THE APPLICATION OF TREATMENTS, AND I USED ROBUST-DESIGN OCCUPANCY MODELING TO ESTIMATE PATCH OCCUPANCY AND DETECTION RATE WITHIN PATCHES, AND RECOLONIZATION AND EXTINCTION (I.E., DISPERSAL) ACROSS PATCHES. I CONDUCTED REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS AND A PERMUTED MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE TO DETERMINE IF PATCH TYPE AND THE ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS EXPLAINED HERPETOFAUNA ASSEMBLAGE. ESTIMATES FOR REPTILES INDICATE THAT OCCUPANCY WAS SEASONALLY CONSTANT IN CONTROL PATCHES (&#X3C8; ~ 0.5), BUT DECLINED TO &#X3C8; ~ 0.15 IN PATCHES FOLLOWING THE APPLICATIONS OF FIRE AND GRAZING.

IN SPITE OF GROWING RELIANCE ON TRANSLOCATIONS IN WILDLIFE CONSERVATION, TRANSLOCATION EFFICACY REMAINS INCONSISTENT. ONE FACTOR THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO FAILED TRANSLOCATIONS IS RELEASING ANIMALS INTO POOR-QUALITY OR OTHERWISE INADEQUATE HABITAT. 2. HERE, WE USED A TARGETED APPROACH TO TEST THE RELATIONSHIP OF HABITAT FEATURES TO POST-TRANSLOCATION DISPERSAL AND SURVIVAL OF JUVENILE MOJAVE DESERT TORTOISES GOPHERUS AGASSIZII. 3. WE SELECTED THREE HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS - RODENT BURROWS, SUBSTRATE TEXTURE (PREVALENCE AND SIZE OF ROCKS) AND WASHES (EPHEMERAL RIVER BEDS) - THAT ARE TIED TO DESERT TORTOISE ECOLOGY. AT THE POINT OF RELEASE, WE DOCUMENTED RODENT BURROW ABUNDANCE, SUBSTRATE TEXTURE AND WASH PRESENCE AND ANALYSED THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE MAXIMUM DISPERSAL. WE ALSO DOCUMENTED THE RELATIVE USE BY EACH INDIVIDUAL FOR EACH HABITAT CHARACTERISTIC AND ANALYSED THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH SURVIVAL AND FATAL ENCOUNTERS WITH A PREDATOR IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER RELEASE. 4. IN GENERAL, THE PRESENCE OF REFUGIA OR OTHER AREAS THAT ENABLED ANIMALS TO AVOID DETECTION, SUCH AS BURROWS AND SUBSTRATE, DECREASED THE OVERALL MORTALITY AS WELL AS PREDATOR-MEDIATED MORTALITY. THE PRESENCE OF WASHES AND SUBSTRATE THAT ENHANCED THE TORTOISES' ABILITY TO AVOID DETECTION ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDUCED DISPERSAL AWAY FROM THE RELEASE SITE. THESE RESULTS INDICATE AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR ALL THREE MEASURED HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS IN DRIVING DISPERSAL, SURVIVAL OR FATAL ENCOUNTERS WITH A PREDATOR IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER TRANSLOCATION. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. RESOURCE MANAGERS USING TRANSLOCATIONS AS A CONSERVATION TOOL SHOULD PRIORITIZE ACQUIRING DATA LINKING HABITAT TO FITNESS. IN PARTICULAR, FOR SPECIES THAT DEPEND ON AVOIDING DETECTION, REFUGES SUCH AS BURROWS AND HABITAT THAT IMPROVED CONCEALMENT HAD NOTABLE ABILITY TO IMPROVE THE SURVIVAL AND DISPERSAL. OUR STUDY ON JUVENILE MOJAVE DESERT TORTOISES SHOWED THAT REFUGE AVAILABILITY OR THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF HABITAT APPROPRIATE FOR CONCEALMENT ARE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR IDENTIFYING TRANSLOCATION SITES FOR SPECIES HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CRYPSIS, CAMOUFLAGE OR OTHER FORMS OF HABITAT MATCHING.",1

IN THE MARINE TURTLES, SEX IS DETERMINED BY INCUBATION TEMPERATURE, SUCH THAT WARMING TEMPERATURES COULD LEAD TO A HIGHER PRODUCTION OF FEMALE HATCHLINGS. BY MEASURING NEST TEMPERATURE, AND USING A MODEL TO RELATE THE INCUBATION TEMPERATURE TO SEX RATIO, WE ESTIMATE THAT CARIBBEAN COLOMBIAN LEATHERBACK SEA TURTLES CURRENTLY PRODUCE APPROXIMATELY 92\% FEMALE HATCHLINGS. WE MODELLED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCUBATION, SAND AND AIR TEMPERATURE, AND UNDER ALL FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS (0.4-6.0 DEGREES C WARMING OVER THE NEXT 100 YEARS), COMPLETE FEMINIZATION COULD OCCUR, AS SOON AS THE NEXT DECADE.

WE EXPERIMENTALLY SHADED CLUTCHES USING SCREENING MATERIAL, AND FOUND THAT IT WAS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING NEST TEMPERATURE, PRODUCING A HIGHER PROPORTION OF MALE HATCHLINGS, WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE FITNESS OR HATCHING SUCCESS. ARTIFICIAL SHADE IN HATCHERIES IS A VERY USEFUL AND SIMPLE TOOL IN YEARS OR PERIODS OF HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURES.

MANAGING AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES FOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT AS LAND USE IS MODIFIED OR INTENSIFIED FOR PRODUCTION. FINDING WAYS TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURE ON BIODIVERSITY IS THEREFORE CRITICAL.

AT 12 SITES, WE SURVEYED REPTILES AND ENVIRONMENTAL COVARIATES IN REMNANT WOODLAND PATCHES AND IN FOUR PADDOCK TYPES: (I) GRAZED PASTURE, (II) LINEAR PLANTINGS, (III) COARSE WOODY DEBRIS (CWD) ADDED TO GRAZED PASTURE AND (IV) FENCES BETWEEN GRAZED PASTURE. EACH SITE WAS EITHER CONTINUOUSLY OR ROTATIONALLY GRAZED. 3. REMNANT VEGETATION AND OTHER VEGETATION ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS TREE COVER AND LEAF LITTER GREATLY INFLUENCED REPTILES. WE RECORDED HIGHER REPTILE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN AREAS WITH MORE TREE COVER AND LEAF LITTER. FOR RARE SPECIES (CAPTURED IN <= 4 SITES < 70 CAPTURES), THERE WERE 5.7 MORE ANIMALS AND 2.6 MORE SPECIES IN SITES WITH 50\% WOODY COVER WITHIN 3 KM COMPARED TO 5\% WOODY COVER. 4.

THIS SUGGESTS THAT DISCRETE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN PATCH AND MATRIX DOES NOT APPLY FOR REPTILES IN THESE SYSTEMS.

REPTILE ASSEMBLAGES CHANGED MOST RAPIDLY IN RESPONSE TO PRESCRIBED BURNING, BUT REPTILE ASSEMBLAGES AT ALL SITES, INCLUDING REFERENCE SITES, WERE GENERALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE BY THE END OF THE STUDY. THUS, WE SUGGEST THAT PRESCRIBED BURNING IN LONGLEAF PINE FORESTS OVER LONG TIME PERIODS IS AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR RESTORING REPTILE ASSEMBLAGES TO THE REFERENCE CONDITION. APPLICATION OF HERBICIDES OR MECHANICAL REMOVAL OF HARDWOOD TREES PROVIDED NO APPARENT BENEFIT TO REPTILES BEYOND WHAT WAS ACHIEVED BY PRESCRIBED FIRE ALONE.",3

WHILST THERE IS EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE OF THE PREDATORY IMPACTS OF CATS ON MAMMALS AND BIRDS, FAR LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS ON REPTILES, ESPECIALLY IN CONTINENTAL SITUATIONS. WE CONDUCTED A FIELD EXPERIMENT TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF FERAL CATS ON TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES IN TROPICAL SAVANNA ENVIRONMENTS OF NORTHERN AUSTRALIA. THREE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS WERE APPLIED TO SIX 64 HA PLOTS TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST RESPONSES OF REPTILE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS TO PREDATOR EXCLUSION AND THE ADDITIVE EFFECTS OF FREQUENT FIRE. REPLICATED PITFALL-TRAPPING WAS UNDERTAKEN IN EACH PLOT ON SEVEN SAMPLING OCCASIONS BETWEEN NOVEMBER 2013 AND NOVEMBER 2015. WE ANALYSED RELATIVE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS DATA USING GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE ABUNDANCE OF REPTILES OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD IN CAT EXCLUDED PLOTS WITH REPTILE ABUNDANCE INCREASING AT TWICE THE RATE IN CAT-EXCLUSION PLOTS COMPARED WITH CAT ACCESSIBLE PLOTS AND THERE WAS AN ADDITIVE EFFECT OF TIME-SINCE-FIRE. CAT EXCLUSION HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON REPTILE SPECIES RICHNESS OVER TIME, HOWEVER THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS PATTERN WAS WEAK WHEN SEASONAL VARIATION WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

WITH THIS AIM WE FIRST STUDIED THE HOME RANGE AND HABITAT PREFERENCES IN WESTERN HERMANN’S TORTOISES BY RADIO TRACKING 15 ADULTS WEEKLY FROM MARCH 2008 TO MAY 2009 IN THREE LOCALITIES WITHIN THE ALBERA POPULATION RANGE (NE IBERIAN PENINSULA). WE ESTIMATED HOME RANGES WITH FIXED KERNEL ESTIMATOR (FK) AND MINIMUM CONVEX POLYGON (MCP) AFTER CHECKING TORTOISE SITE FIDELITY. WE OBSERVED THAT HOME RANGE SIZE DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES (MEAN FK = 2.01 HA, MEAN MCP = 3.01 HA). SECONDLY, WE STUDIED MACROHABITAT SELECTION USING A VEGETATION MAP. PREFERRED HABITATS WERE OPEN SHRUBLAND, OPEN FOREST AND BARREN LAND DURING THE ACTIVITY PERIOD, AND DENSE FOREST, DENSE SHRUBLAND AND OPEN SHRUBLAND DURING THE HIBERNATION. NEXT, WE ASSESSED MICROHABITAT SELECTION ALONG FIVE PERIODS OF THE ANNUAL CYCLE: HIBERNATION, EMERGENCE FROM HIBERNATION, SPRING, SUMMER AND AUTUMN. WE THEN LOCATED MARKED TORTOISES WEEKLY AND CLASSIFIED THE PLANT SPECIES OBSERVED IN EACH LOCATION. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSES SHOWED THAT TORTOISES SELECTED SHRUBS WITH TREES DURING HIBERNATION, BRAMBLE DURING SUMMER AND HERBACEOUS HABITAT DURING THE BREEDING SEASON. ALL THESE RESULTS CAN PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS THAT SET ASIDE AREAS OF HABITAT CRITICAL TO CONSERVE VIABLE POPULATIONS, ALTHOUGH IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO PREVENT MORTALITY FROM FORESTRY WORKS.

GRASSLAND RESTORATION IS OFTEN ASSUMED TO PROVIDE IMPROVED WILDLIFE HABITAT, OSTENSIBLY INCREASING THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF AT LEAST SOME NATIVE WILDLIFE SPECIES RELATIVE TO UNRESTORED, INVADED ANNUAL GRASSLANDS. 2. WE COMPARED RODENT, SNAKE AND RAPTOR ACTIVITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS AT PAIRED UNRESTORED AND RESTORED GRASSLANDS ACROSS FOUR BLOCKED LOCATIONS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY USING TRAPPING AND OBSERVATIONAL SURVEYS IN UP TO FOUR SEASONS PER GUILD FROM 2014 TO 2015. RESTORED TREATMENTS WERE PLANTED WITH NATIVE PERENNIAL GRASSES 13-24 YEARS PRIOR TO STUDY INITIATION BUT WERE PARTIALLY RE-INVADED BY MEDITERRANEAN ANNUAL GRASSES AND FORBS. UNRESTORED TREATMENTS CONTAINED SIMILAR NON-NATIVE PLANT SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES AS RESTORED TREATMENTS, BUT DID NOT CONTAIN ANY NATIVE GRASS. 3. RODENT, SNAKE AND RAPTOR ACTIVITY WAS GENERALLY HIGHER IN UNRESTORED RELATIVE TO RESTORED TREATMENTS. FOR RODENTS, THE NON-NATIVE MUS MUSCULUS (HOUSE MOUSE) SHOWED THE GREATEST DISPARITY IN ABUNDANCE, WHILE GREATER RAPTORS AND SNAKES LIKELY RESPONDED TO GREATER RODENT ABUNDANCE. 4. WITHIN TREATMENTS, SPECIES-SPECIFIC RODENT RESPONSES WERE RELATED TO STRUCTURE OF PHYSICAL VEGETATION. IN PARTICULAR, PEROMYSCUS MANICULATUS (NATIVE DEER MOUSE) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE BARE GROUND AND SHORTER VEGETATION, WHILE THE HOUSE MOUSE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LESS BARE GROUND AND TALLER VEGETATION, REGARDLESS OF TREATMENT TYPE.

OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT WHILE GRASSLAND RESTORATION MAY PROMOTE PERSISTENCE OF NATIVE PLANT COMMUNITIES, RESTORATION MAY NOT BE BENEFICIAL TO SOME HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS, AND IN FACT MAY REDUCE HABITAT VALUE FOR SOME NATIVE PREDATORS IN GRASSLANDS INVADED BY MEDITERRANEAN PLANT SPECIES. CHANGES IN VEGETATION STRUCTURE CAN STRONGLY IMPACT WILDLIFE SPECIES COMPOSITION, SUGGESTING A MORE NUANCED APPROACH IS REQUIRED FOR THE RESTORATION OF DESIRED WILDLIFE COMMUNITIES.

IN CONTRAST, DOMED TORTOISES DID NOT SELECT AREAS WITH CACTUS AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT PROVIDE THE SAME SEED-DISPERSAL FUNCTIONS FOR THE CACTUS AS THE INTRODUCED OR THE ORIGINAL, NOW EXTINCT, SADDLEBACKED TORTOISES. INTERCHANGEABILITY OF EXTANT MEGAHERBIVORES AS REPLACEMENTS FOR EXTINCT FORMS THEREFORE SHOULD BE SCRUTINIZED GIVEN THE LACK OF EQUIVALENCY WE OBSERVED IN CLOSELY RELATED FORMS OF GIANT TORTOISES.

SUCH RESTORATION HAS OCCURRED AROUND THE WORLD, EVEN THOUGH THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF STRIPS AND PATCHES OF VEGETATION REMAINS CONTROVERSIAL. USING REPTILE COMMUNITIES FROM SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA, WE ASSESSED THE CONSERVATION VALUE OF REVEGETATION IN STRIPS AND ALONGSIDE REMNANT PATCHES COMPARED WITH REMNANT VEGETATION AND CLEARED ROADSIDES. WE ALSO EXAMINED THE DISTANCE THAT REPTILES OCCURRED FROM REMNANT PATCHES INTO LINEAR VEGETATION. WE FOUND THAT REPTILE SPECIES RICHNESS AND COUNTS DID NOT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFER BETWEEN REVEGETATED, REMNANT AND CLEARED HABITATS, OR BETWEEN LINEAR STRIP AND PATCH TREATMENTS. THIS MAY INDICATE THAT SPECIES SENSITIVE TO LAND CLEARING HAVE ALREADY BEEN LOST FROM THE LANDSCAPE. THESE RESULTS IMPLY THAT IF SPECIALIST SPECIES HAVE ALREADY BEEN LOST, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURE ON BIODIVERSITY. FURTHERMORE, REVEGETATION WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT FAUNA WILL RECOLONIZE MAY BE UNREALISTIC AND TRANSLOCATIONS MAY BE NECESSARY. UNEXPECTEDLY, WE RECORDED HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS AND COUNTS OF RARE REPTILE SPECIES IN REMNANT LINEAR STRIPS AS DISTANCE FROM REMNANT PATCHES INCREASED. GROUND-LAYER ATTRIBUTES WERE IMPORTANT FOR INCREASING REPTILE SPECIES RICHNESS AND COUNTS AND IN STRUCTURING REPTILE COMMUNITIES, EXPLAINING APPROXIMATELY THREE TIMES AS MUCH VARIATION AS REMNANT SHAPE OR VEGETATION TYPE (REMNANT, REVEGETATED, CLEARED). MANAGEMENT AGENCIES SHOULD PROTECT AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE REMNANT LINEAR STRIPS IF RARER REPTILES ARE TO BE RETAINED, PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO GROUND-LAYER ATTRIBUTES.

THIS STUDY COMPARES THE MOVEMENT PATTERNS, SITE FIDELITY, AND SURVIVAL PROBABILITY OF RESIDENT AND HARD-RELEASED MUSK TURTLES (STERNOTHERUS ODORATUS) IN A COMPLEX OF PATCHY DISTRIBUTED WETLANDS. OUR RESULTS ARE DIFFERENT FROM MOST TRANSLOCATION STUDIES AS THE MAJORITY OF TRANSLOCATED TURTLES HAD MOVEMENT (MINIMUM CONVEX POLYGON AREA, TOTAL DISTANCE MOVED, NUMBER OF WETLANDS USED, AND THE NUMBER OF MOVEMENT SHIFTS BETWEEN WETLANDS), RELEASE SITE FIDELITY, AND WETLAND FIDELITY PATTERNS THAT WERE SIMILAR TO RESIDENT TURTLES. IN ADDITION, THE SURVIVAL PROBABILITIES OF RESIDENT AND TRANSLOCATED TURTLES WERE BOTH HIGH. WE BELIEVE THE COMBINATION OF POOR OVERLAND MOVEMENT CAPABILITIES AND THE PATCHY DISTRIBUTION OF WETLANDS SURROUNDED BY A STRONG BOUNDARY MATRIX OF TERRESTRIAL HABITAT, POTENTIALLY INCREASED THE COSTS OF LEAVING THE WETLAND. THE HIGH COSTS OF TRAVELLING OVERLAND TO MORE DISTANT WETLANDS MAY HAVE CONSTRAINED THE TRANSLOCATED TURTLES DISPERSAL FROM THE RELEASE SITE AND INCREASED RELEASE SITE FIDELITY.

WE TESTED THE EFFICACY OF MODIFIED EXCLUSION DEVICES (VERTICALLY ORIENTED EXCLUSION BARS AND A CONSTRICTION RECTANGLE) USING AN ADAPTIVE APPROACH INCLUDING IN SITU OBSERVATIONS, CONTROLLED BEHAVIOURAL EXPERIMENTS AND FIELD TRIALS. IN SITU OBSERVATIONS MADE BY CAMERA WERE USED TO ESTIMATE TURTLE CATCHABILITY AND TO DOCUMENT TURTLE BEHAVIOUR DURING NET INTERACTIONS, WHICH WAS USED TO INFORM BRD DESIGN AND PLACEMENT. IN CONTROLLED BEHAVIOURAL EXPERIMENTS, THE PASSAGE RATES OF TARGET FISH (I.E. SUNFISH), BYCATCH FISH (E.G. GAME FISH) AND TURTLES ACROSS A MODIFIED NET THROAT SUGGESTED THAT A 5 CM CONSTRICTION RECTANGLE SHOULD BE SUITABLE FOR REDUCING BYCATCH IN THIS FISHERY; TURTLES READILY TURNED SIDEWAYS TO PASS THROUGH LARGER OPENINGS. PAIRED FIELD TRIALS INDICATED THAT A 5 CM CONSTRICTION RECTANGLE REDUCED TURTLE BYCATCH FOR ALL SPECIES. THE CONSTRICTION RECTANGLE ALSO REDUCED CAPTURES OF NON-TARGET GAME FISH. IN CONTROLLED BEHAVIOURAL EXPERIMENTS, THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF A REDUCTION IN CATCHES OF TARGET SUNFISH; HOWEVER, IN PAIRED FIELD TRIALS, THERE WAS A 23.4\% REDUCTION IN SUNFISH CATCHES. WE RECOMMEND THE USE OF A 5 CM CONSTRICTION RECTANGLE FOR FISHERIES TARGETING SUNFISH IN AREAS WHERE FRESHWATER TURTLES ARE PRESENT.",1

HERBACEOUS GROUND COVER IN OLIVE GROVES CREATES HETEROGENEOUS PATCHWORKS THAT DIFFER AS REGARDS HOW INTENSIVELY FARMED OLIVE GROVES ARE STRUCTURED AND COMPOSED, WHICH MAY LEAD TO A DECREASE IN THIS LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY. REPTILES RAPIDLY RESPOND TO CHANGES IN VEGETATION AND OTHER HABITAT DISTURBANCES, IN SPITE OF WHICH, THIS TAXA HAS RECEIVED VERY LITTLE ATTENTION WITH REGARD TO THEIR VULNERABILITY TO AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE RESPONSE OF A SQUAMATE REPTILE ASSEMBLAGE TO DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN OLIVE GROVES. REPTILE COMMUNITIES WERE RECORDED IN AREAS WITH THREE TYPES OF OLIVE GROVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: BARE GROUND, NATURAL COVER CROP, AND MONOSPECIFIC COVER CROP. WE FURTHER COMPARED HABITAT STRUCTURE AND VEGETATION RICHNESS IN THE STUDY AREA IN ORDER TO VERIFY IF MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE AND DIVERSITY OF SQUAMATE REPTILES SPECIES WITHIN OLIVE GROVES. THE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF REPTILES DIFFERED AMONG THE THREE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS MODULATED BY THE AGE OF THE OLIVE TREES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SQUAMATE REPTILE COMMUNITIES WERE MORE RESTRICTED IN AREAS OF INTENSE MANAGEMENT (BARE GROUND) THAN IN THOSE WITH COVER CROPS. WHEN HERBACEOUS COVERS EXISTED, NATURAL GROUND COVER HARBOURED A MORE DIVERSE COMMUNITY. OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT WHILE MONOSPECIFIC COVER CROPS IMPROVE THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF REPTILES, SPECIES RICHNESS DOES NOT INCREASE; HOWEVER, MORE HETEROGENEOUS HERBACEOUS GROUND COVER ( WHICH, FOR INSTANCE, CONTAIN MORE SPECIES AND ARE MORE SIMILAR TO NATURAL VEGETATION) WOULD BE A BETTER SOLUTION REGARDING THE PROMOTION OF DIVERSITY IN REPTILEASSEMBLAGES IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. FINALLY OUR RESULTS MAY BE USED TO IMPROVE THE HABITAT QUALITY OFSQUAMATE REPTILE COMMUNITIES IN SIMILAR WOODY CROPS LIKE VINEYARDS OR ORCHARDS, WHERE COVER CROPS AREBEGINNING TO BE IMPLEMENTED.

HOWEVER, THE METHODS USED ARE OFTEN APPLIED HAPHAZARDLY AND ARE RARELY EVALUATED, ESPECIALLY IN TROPICAL ASIA. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF LONG-DISTANCE TRANSLOCATION ON THE WHITE-LIPPED PIT VIPER (TRIMERESURUS ALBOLABRIS) IN SOUTH CHINA, WHERE THEY ARE ROUTINELY REMOVED FROM URBAN AREAS OR HOMES AND TRANSLOCATED INTO NATIONAL PARKS. USING RADIO TELEMETRY, WE COMPARED THE ECOLOGY AND BIOLOGY OF `RESIDENT' AND `TRANSLOCATED' SNAKES TO DETERMINE IF LONG-DISTANCE TRANSLOCATION (>3 KM) IS A VIABLE CONSERVATION OPTION. TRANSLOCATION EXTENDED THE PERIOD OVER WHICH PREDATION OCCURRED AND SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED SURVIVAL. TRANSLOCATED SNAKES MADE UNIDIRECTIONAL MOVEMENTS AWAY FROM POINTS OF RELEASE, YET THESE MOVEMENTS WERE NOT ORIENTED TOWARDS POINTS OF ORIGIN AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE FOR HOMING BEHAVIOR. TRANS LOCATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FREQUENCY OF MOVEMENTS AND DISTANCES-MOVED BY FEMALE SNAKES, BUT NO SUCH DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED FOR MALE SNAKES. IN CONTRAST WITH RESIDENT SNAKES, TRANSLOCATED SNAKES DID NOT SHOW SYNCHRONY IN THE ONSET OF BRUMATION, AND TRANSLOCATION APPEARED TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT REPRODUCTION IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LONG-DISTANCE TRANSLOCATION IS NOT THE BEST MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO HANDLE NUISANCE INDIVIDUALS OF THIS SPECIES. FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY CAN BE USED TO PRESCRIBE IMPROVEMENTS FOR CURRENT STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH NUISANCE SNAKES IN HONG KONG AND IN THE REGION. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",1

HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN NO STUDIES THAT HAVE TESTED WHETHER ‘TURTLE-FRIENDLY’ LIGHTS ARE BENIGN TO HATCHLING SEA TURTLE SEA-FINDING ABILITY. AIMS WE TESTED TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF ‘TURTLE-FRIENDLY’ LIGHTS (LED AMBER-LIGHT PEAK INTENSITY 620 NM AND LED RED-LIGHT PEAK INTENSITY 640 NM) TO SEE WHETHER THEY ARE DISRUPTIVE TO THE SEA-FINDING ABILITY OF EASTERN-COAST AUSTRALIAN LOGGERHEAD TURTLE HATCHLINGS. METHODS USING STANDARD CIRCULAR-ARENA EXPERIMENTS, WE ASSESSED THE DIRECTIONAL PREFERENCE OF NEWLY EMERGED LOGGERHEAD TURTLE HATCHLINGS FROM THE WOONGARRA COAST OF QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA, DURING DIFFERENT MOON PHASES WITHOUT ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING AND IN THE PRESENCE OF ‘TURTLE-FRIENDLY’ LIGHTS.

IN CONTRAST, UN-PENNED GECKOS MOVED DISTANCES OF UP TO 40 M OUTSIDE OF THEIR RELEASE AREA, AND EFFECTIVELY INCREASED THE AREA THAT THEY WERE OCCUPYING AS A GROUP 4.4-FOLD OVER THE 3-WEEK PERIOD. WE SUSPECT THAT WHEN NAULTINUS GECKOS ARE RELEASED WITHOUT TIME IN A PEN, SOME INDIVIDUALS MAY DISPERSE TOO FAR TO CONTRIBUTE TO A BREEDING POPULATION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE LIKELIHOOD OF POPULATION ESTABLISHMENT AND RATE OF POPULATION GROWTH MAY BE DIMINISHED. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS SUPPORTED BY A SURVEY WE CONDUCTED THE FOLLOWING SUMMER IN WHICH ALL FOUR ADULT FEMALE GECKOS FOUND AT THE PENNED SITE WERE GRAVID, BUT NEITHER OF THE FEMALES RESIGHTED AT THE UN-PENNED SITE WAS GRAVID. WE BELIEVE THAT THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF PENNING (E.G. RESTRICTING INITIAL DISPERSAL, INCREASED EASE OF MONITORING) MAY OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGES (E.G. COST) FOR MANY HERPETOFAUNA TRANSLOCATIONS.",2

WE USED SEA TURTLE TRADE IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS, WHERE TURTLES HAVE BEEN FARM RAISED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS, AS A CASE STUDY TO EXPLORE CONSUMER PREFERENCES TOWARD WILD-SOURCED (ILLEGAL) AND FARMED (LEGAL) PRODUCTS AND POTENTIAL CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS.

THE CONCEPT OF BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION RELIES PRIMARILY ON PROTECTED AREAS. YET, PROTECTED AREAS ARE INFLUENCED BY THE SURROUNDING ANTHROPOGENIC MATRIX AS DEGRADATION OF LANDSCAPES USED BY HUMANS ALSO HAS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON SPECIES WITHIN THE ADJACENT PROTECTED, NON-DEGRADED ECOSYSTEMS. INCREASING THE HETEROGENEITY OF THE ANTHROPOGENIC LANDSCAPE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROMOTE BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN PROTECTED AND NON-PROTECTED SITES. 2. TO FIND OPTIONS FOR RECONCILING LAND USE AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, WE EVALUATED REPTILE DIVERSITY OF TWO AREAS. BOTH AREAS CONTAINED THREE TYPES OF HABITAT: CULTIVATED AREAS, DEGRADED FOREST AND UNDEGRADED FOREST. IN ONE AREA (TSIM), A NETWORK OF HEDGES SURROUNDING FIELDS PROVIDED A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE RESOURCES FOR REPTILE SPECIES. ANOTHER AREA (ANDREMBA) LACKED SUCH LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS. 3. IN 480 SURVEY WALKS ON 48 TRANSECTS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED OVER TWO AREAS, WE RECORDED A TOTAL OF 24 REPTILE SPECIES, OF WHICH 18 OCCURRED IN BOTH AREAS. 4. PERENNIAL PLANT COVER EXPLAINED THE VARIATION IN LOCAL (PER TRANSECT) SPECIES RICHNESS BEST. SPECIES RICHNESS WAS LOW ALONG FIELD MARGINS IN THE CULTIVATED AREA THAT LACKED HEDGES AND HAD A PERENNIAL PLANT COVER BELOW 20\%. IT WAS HIGH IN UNDEGRADED AND DEGRADED FOREST AND ALONG HEDGES IN THE CULTIVATED AREA WHERE PERENNIAL PLANT COVER WAS ABOVE 40\%. 5. SIMILARITIES OF REPTILE ASSEMBLAGES WERE HIGHER BETWEEN HABITAT TYPES IN THE AREA STRUCTURALLY ENRICHED WITH HEDGES, THAN IN THE AREA LACKING SUCH ENRICHMENT. IN THE LATTER AREA, BETA DIVERSITY WAS LARGELY THE RESULT OF SPECIES LOSSES WHICH COULD RESULT FROM IMPEDED MOVEMENT BETWEEN HABITATS. 6. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. A CONTINUOUS NETWORK OF HEDGES AND ASSOCIATED TREES AND SHRUBS CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF REPTILE BIODIVERSITY IN DRY SOUTH-WESTERN MADAGASCAR. WHEN PRESENT, THESE INTERCONNECTED LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS ENHANCE HABITAT SUITABILITY OF THE AGRICULTURALLY USED MATRIX. THEY ALSO PROVIDE HABITAT FOR SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN. HIGH SIMILARITY BETWEEN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE AREA WITH HEDGES INDICATED THAT MOVEMENT BETWEEN HABITATS WAS FACILITATED. WE CONCLUDE THAT INCORPORATING HEDGES IN PASTURES CONTRIBUTES NOT JUST TO THE SUITABILITY OF THE MATRIX, BUT ALSO ENHANCES LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY AND THUS IMPROVES BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN THE HUMAN-USED LANDSCAPE.",2

AIMS OUR STUDY HAD THE FOLLOWING FOUR GOALS: (1) TO EXAMINE EFFECTS OF CAGES ON THE NEST ENVIRONMENT, (2) DETERMINE WHETHER NEST CAGING AFFECTS PROXIES FOR HATCHLING FITNESS, (3) EVALUATE WHETHER NEST PREDATORS PREFERENTIALLY INTERACT WITH CERTAIN CAGE TYPES, AND (4) ASSESS THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT NEST CAGING DESIGNS. METHODS IN 2010 AND 2011 IN ALGONQUIN PROVINCIAL PARK, ONTARIO, PAINTED TURTLE (CHRYSEMYS PICTA; N = 93) AND SNAPPING TURTLE (CHELYDRA SERPENTINA; N = 91) NESTS WERE ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE TREATMENTS (WOODEN-SIDED CAGES, ABOVE- AND BELOW-GROUND WIRE CAGES) OR A CONTROL (NO NEST CAGE) AND OUTFITTED WITH A DATA LOGGER TO RECORD INCUBATION TEMPERATURE. AFTER EMERGENCE, HATCHING SUCCESS AND PROXIES OF HATCHLING FITNESS WERE MEASURED. KEY RESULTS NEST TEMPERATURE, HATCHING SUCCESS, FREQUENCY OF HATCHLING DEFORMITIES AND LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE DID NOT DIFFER AMONG CAGE TREATMENTS. HOWEVER, HATCHLING BODY CONDITION DIFFERED AMONG TREATMENTS; WOODEN-SIDED AND BELOW-GROUND CAGES HAD THE MOST POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON BODY CONDITION IN PAINTED AND SNAPPING TURTLES, RESPECTIVELY. PREDATOR INTERACTIONS DID NOT DIFFER AMONG TREATMENTS, AND WOODEN-SIDED CAGES WERE THE MOST INEXPENSIVE TO CONSTRUCT. CONCLUSIONS NEST CAGES DID NOT ALTER THE NEST ENVIRONMENT FROM NATURAL CONDITIONS BUT DID ALTER HATCHLING BODY CONDITION, AND NEST CAGING AFFECTED SPECIES DIFFERENTLY. IMPLICATIONS NEST CAGES ARE KNOWN TO REDUCE NEST DEPREDATION, AND OUR DATA INDICATED THAT, IN GENERAL, NEST CAGES ALSO DO NOT AFFECT THE NEST ENVIRONMENT OR PROXIES FOR HATCHLING FITNESS.
