abstract={The potential link between certified organic farming and biodiversity and conservation remains unexplored in Australia, despite the country having the world's largest amount of certified organic farmland and unprecedented biodiversity loss. This study modelled the spatial effects of organic farming (intensity of local farming systems), environmental heterogeneity, and urbanisation on two widely studied environmental taxa — vascular plant and bird species richness (surrogate measures of biodiversity) — in South Australia, using a unique certified organic farming postcode level dataset from 2001 to 2016 (N = 5440). The spatial Durbin error model results confirmed the positive spatial congruence of organic farming with greater vascular plant species richness, whereas only weak to no significant evidence was found for bird species richness. Landscape features (habitat heterogeneity) and green vegetation (a proxy indicator of resource availability) – rather than organic farming – appeared to be most associated with bird species richness. Both plant and bird species richness were positively associated with habitat heterogeneity (land cover diversity and elevation range), plant productivity and proportion of conservation land and water bodies. Whereas, increased anthropogenic land use for cropping and horticultural farming, soil type diversity and proximity to the coast significantly reduced species richness of both taxa. The results suggest that a multi-scale spatially refined biodiversity conservation strategy, with spatial targeting that promotes low intensive farming systems and increases landscape heterogeneity to provide quality habitat (a whole of landscape approach by incorporating private agricultural landholders), could be beneficial for biodiversity conservation. © 2022},

abstract={Translocations of captive-reared animals are commonly used to stabilize declining wildlife populations. However, captive-reared animals are often raised in conditions dissimilar to their release sites and lacking natural characteristics, which could alter movement patterns and postrelease survivorship. These patterns can be further altered by season of release and soft-release conditions. We reared juvenile Eastern Hellbenders (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis) for 18 mo in captivity in one of two conditions: a control condition with low-velocity water flow (unconditioned) or a treatment condition with moving water (conditioned) that simulated natural flow velocities at their intended release site. We divided 4-yr-old Hellbenders (n = 118) into six treatment groups to determine the effects of release season (fall or summer), release type (standard soft release or enhanced soft release), and conditioning (unconditioned or conditioned) on the number of days until first movement, release site retention, and survival. In November 2017, we released 80 radio-tagged individuals (40 conditioned and 40 unconditioned) into soft-release structures in the Blue River, Indiana. In July 2018, we released another 38 radio-tagged individuals (18 conditioned and 20 unconditioned) into soft-release structures at the same site. After release, we tracked each individual one to three times weekly for 10 mo (fall release) or 12 mo (summer release). We found that treatment groups released into caged cobble beds (i.e., enhanced soft release) delayed their first movement and had higher release site retention relative to groups released under caged shelter rocks (i.e., standard soft release). We found that conditioning had a positive effect on survival but only in the treatment group released in the summer. By combining techniques and releasing conditioned individuals in the summer using enhanced soft releases, we increased annual survival of captive-reared Hellbenders from a probability of 0.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.31-0.79) to 0.74 (95% CI = 0.55-0.99). Our results provide important information about techniques that can be adopted across captive-rearing programs to help maximize the conservation success of Eastern Hellbenders. © 2022 by The Herpetologists' League, Inc.},

abstract={Urbanizations are one of the main causes of biodiversity loss. However, birds are no strangers to the new challenges of city life. The Great Kiskadee (Pitangus sulphuratus) is common in various environments, including rural and urban. In Greater San Miguel de Tucumán (GSMT), province of Tucumán, Argentina, there are higher levels of urbanization to the east and lower levels to the west, bordering the Sierra de San Javier. Although different aspects of the biology of birds in natural environments are known, knowledge in urban environments is scarce. The objective of this work was to evaluate different aspects of the nesting of the Great Kiskadee in urban environments and how they vary between different levels of urbanization. The study was carried out in three sectors of the GSMT, two in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán and one in Yerba Buena, during the reproductive seasons (September-March) of 2020-2022. A total of 46 nests were found, of which 27 of them were successful. The known breeding period for the species, the height of nest supports are extended, and the materials used in nest construction and the survival success of fledglings are described in greater detail. There were no differences in the relative abundance of Great Kiskadee, nor in the reproductive traits evaluated, between the different levels of urbanization. These results could indicate that the Great Kiskadee is an urban adapter in terms of its nesting and relative abundance. © 2022, Aves Argentinas - Asociacion Ornitologica del Plata.

abstract={Anthropogenic land-use change continues to be predicated as a major driver of terrestrial biodiversity loss for the rest of this century. It has been determined that the effect of climate change on wildlife population will accelerate the rate and process of decline of global vertebrate populations. We investigated wildlife composition, occupancy, and activity pattern along the larger climate resilient forests that serve as microrefugia for a wide range of species under the escalating climate change. We used camera trap survey covering 250 km2 of climate microrefugia in Dadeldhura hills in far western region of Nepal. We used 62 trapping locations accumulating 1800 trap nights taking 98,916 photographs in 62 days-survey period during the summer season of 2020. We photographed 23 mammalian species with estimated species richness of 30 species (95% CI: 25–34) based on multi-species occupancy model. We estimated overall species occupancy ψ(SE(ψ)) to be 0.87 (0.09) in climatic microrefugia. While human activity predominated throughout the day, the majority of animals was found to exhibit nocturnal temporal patterns. Tiger and hyaena, two of the top predators, were newly discovered in the western Himalayan range of Nepal, with their discovery at the 34 highest elevations of 2511 meters and 2000m, respectively. In Nepal, high-altitude tiger range is characterized by tiger distribution above a 2000 m cutoff representing habitats in the physiographic zone of high mountains and above. Our findings establish a baseline and show that the climatic microrefugia that have been identified have high levels of species richness and occupancy, which characterize the Dadeldhura hill forest ranges as biologically varied and ecologically significant habitat. These areas identified as climatic microrefugia habitats should be the focus of conservation efforts, particularly efforts to reduce human disturbance and adapt to climate change. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Climate change alters ecological communities by affecting individual species and interactions between species. However, the impacts of climate change may be buffered by community diversity: diverse communities may be more resistant to climate-driven perturbations than simple communities. Here, we assess how diversity influences long-term thermal niche variation in communities under climate change. We use 50-year continental-scale data on bird communities during breeding and non-breeding seasons to quantify the communities’ thermal variability. Thermal variability is measured as the temporal change in the community’s average thermal niche and it indicates community’s response to climate change. Then, we study how the thermal variability varies as a function of taxonomic, functional, and evolutionary diversity using linear models. We find that communities with low thermal niche variation have higher functional diversity, with this pattern being measurable in the non-breeding but not in the breeding season. Given the expected increase in seasonal variation in the future climate, the differences in bird communities’ thermal variability between breeding and non-breeding seasons may grow wider. Importantly, our results suggest that functionally diverse wildlife communities can mitigate effects of climate change by hindering changes in thermal niche variability, which underscores the importance of addressing the climate and biodiversity crises together. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={The simultaneous conservation of species richness and evenness is important to effectively reduce biodiversity loss and keep ecosystem health. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has been used as a powerful tool for identifying community composition, but it does not necessarily provide quantitative information due to several methodological limitations. Thus, the quantification of eDNA through metabarcoding is an important frontier of eDNA-based biomonitoring. Particularly, the qMiSeq approach has recently been developed as a quantitative metabarcoding method and has attracted much attention due to its usefulness. The aim here was to evaluate the performance of the qMiSeq approach as a quantitative monitoring tool for fish communities by comparing the quantified eDNA concentrations with the results of fish capture surveys. The eDNA water sampling and the capture surveys using the electrical shocker were conducted at a total of 21 sites in four rivers in Japan. As a result, we found significant positive relationships between the eDNA concentrations of each species quantified by qMiSeq and both the abundance and biomass of each captured taxon at each site. Furthermore, for seven out of eleven taxa, a significant positive relationship was observed between quantified DNA concentrations by sample and the abundance and/or biomass. In total, our results demonstrated that eDNA metabarcoding with the qMiSeq approach is a suitable and useful tool for quantitative monitoring of fish communities. Due to the simplicity of the eDNA analysis, the eDNA metabarcoding with qMiSeq approach would promote further growth of quantitative monitoring of biodiversity. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Biodiversity loss is a global concern, and agriculture is one of the economic sectors responsible for this impact. The assessment of ecosystems under the influence of livestock production is essential for knowing their integrity and ability to provide ecosystem services. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the application of LEAP/FAO guidelines for quantitative assessment of biodiversity in the livestock sector at the local scale (farm level) in a group of six study cases in Uruguay. A set of 20 indicators was used, including seven key thematic issues: habitat protection, habitat change, wildlife conservation, invasive species, pollution, aquatic biodiversity, off-farm feed, and landscape-scale conservation. The results show that the LEAP biodiversity assessment guidelines can be useful to characterize the state of ecosystems under pastoral use and some specific components of their biodiversity, as well as assess the interaction of the production system with the environment and plan management accordingly. This work also provides an analysis of the methodology used and recommendations to facilitate its application by the sector. The results from the application of the indicators show a great deal of wild biodiversity that uses grazing systems based on native grasslands as habitats and the acceptable integrity of these ecosystems. On average, farms have 83% of their native ecosystem, with a value of 3.5 for the Ecosystem Integrity Index. In terms of the richness of different groups, there was an average number of species of 112 herbaceous plants, 48 woody plants, 48 spiders, 150 birds, and 14 fish. The main goal of this work is to help in the wider application of the guidelines by facilitating decisions about methodology, necessary resources, and technical support. Moreover, another goal is to show the importance of native grasslands-based livestock systems for biodiversity conservation. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={The rapidly declining biosphere integrity, representing one of the core planetary boundaries, is alarming. In particular, the global numbers of mammals, birds, fishes, and plants declined by 68% from 1970 to 2016. One of the most widely accepted measures to halt the rate of biodiversity loss is to maintain and expand protected areas that are effectively managed. However, doing so requires substantial finance derived from nature-based tourism, specifically visitors from urban areas. Using the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) for conducting analysis on 535 Vietnamese urban residents, the current study examined how their biodiversity loss perceptions can affect their willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation in protected areas. We found that perceived environmental degradation, loss of economic growth, loss of nature-based recreation opportunities, and loss of knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss indirectly affect the willingness to pay through the mediation of the attitude towards conservation. Notably, perceived knowledge loss also has a direct positive influence on the willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation. In contrast, perceived loss of health is negatively associated with the attitude towards conservation. Based on these findings, we suggest that building an eco-surplus culture among urban residents by stimulating their subjective cost-benefit judgments towards biodiversity loss can be a promising way to generate more finance from nature-based tourism for conservation in protected areas and ease the domestic government’s and international organizations’ funding allocation problems. Eco-surplus culture is a set of pro-environmental attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors shared by a group of people to reduce negative anthropogenic impacts on the environment and conserve and restore nature. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Numerous terrestrial mammal species have experienced extensive population declines during past centuries, due largely to anthropogenic pressures. For some species, including the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), environmental and legal protection has more recently led to population growth and recolonization of parts of their historic ranges. While heralded as conservation success, only few such recoveries have been examined from a genetic perspective, i.e. whether genetic variability and connectivity have been restored. We here use large-scale and long-term genetic monitoring data from UK otters, whose population underwent a well-documented population decline between the 1950s and 1970s, to explore the dynamics of a population re-expansion over a 21-year period. We genotyped otters from across Wales and England at five time points between 1994 and 2014 using 15 microsatellite loci. We used this combination of long-term temporal and large-scale spatial sampling to evaluate 3 hypotheses relating to genetic recovery that (i) gene flow between subpopulations would increase over time, (ii) genetic diversity of previously isolated populations would increase and that (iii) genetic structuring would weaken over time. Although we found an increase in inter-regional gene flow and admixture levels among subpopulations, there was no significant temporal change in either heterozygosity or allelic richness. Genetic structuring among the main subpopulations hence remained strong and showed a clear historical continuity. These findings highlight an underappreciated aspect of population recovery of endangered species: that genetic recovery may often lag behind the processes of spatial and demographic recovery. In other words, the restoration of the physical connectivity of populations does not necessarily lead to genetic connectivity. Our findings emphasize the need for genetic data as an integral part of conservation monitoring, to enable the potential vulnerability of populations to be evaluated. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Biodiversity loss is happening at an unprecedented rate, especially in countries like Vietnam, with rich biodiversity and a high population growth rate. One of the main causes of biodiversity loss in Vietnam is the unsustainable bushmeat consumption rate in urban areas. To help mitigate the demand for bushmeat, this study aims to examine the associations between biodiversity loss perceptions, perception toward the prohibition of illegal wildlife consumption, and bushmeat consumption behaviors among urban residents in Vietnam. The investigation employed the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF)—an analytical framework that combines the strengths of the mindsponge mechanism and Bayesian inference to facilitate investigation into psychological and behavioral issues—on 535 respondents from urban areas across Vietnam (mostly in the two urban centers of Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi). We found that people perceiving environmental degradation, and losses of economic growth, nature-based recreation opportunities, health, and knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss were more likely to support the prohibition of illegal wildlife consumption. Although urban residents tended to consume bushmeat less frequently if they perceived losses of economic growth and knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss, the perception of environmental degradation had an opposite effect on the behavior. Additionally, people consuming bushmeat frequently and supporting the biodiversity loss preventive measure seemed to share similar features: high income and educational levels. These paradoxical results hint at the cultural additivity phenomenon—the willingness to incorporate into one's mind the new values that might or might not logically contradict their existing core cultural values—and its influence on psychology and behavior among Vietnamese urban residents. Given the influence of cultural additivity, it is recommended to put tougher measures (e.g., financial punishment) into perspective so that urban people can recognize the high “cost” of bushmeat consumption and change their perceptions and behaviors accordingly. Apart from that, social marketing, demarketing, or educational campaigns should convey knowledge and information that can help receivers relate biodiversity loss and bushmeat consumption to their subjective cost-benefit judgments rather than the rarity of the species to avoid triggering an anthropogenic Allee effect—for example, emphasizing the penalty for consuming bushmeat and negative impacts of biodiversity loss on humans in targeted campaigns (e.g., losses of economic growth and knowledge). © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={The global biodiversity crisis is escalating rapidly, with nearly a million species facing extinction risk in the near future. Monitoring of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV; key variables measured to detect changes in biodiversity) over time is important for biodiversity conservation, which in turn necessitates baseline estimates of EBVs. Using camera-trap data for six years (2013–2018) and a Bayesian multispecies occupancy model, we estimated species richness and species-specific occupancy of a mammalian community in Pakke Tiger Reserve, India. We detected 28 species of mammals in our camera traps. The model-based estimate of species richness during the study period was 41 (95 % CRI: 39–42) species, with no evidence of any substantial temporal variation. We found that carnivore and herbivore species richness was higher in greener habitats and that omnivore species richness was higher at lower-elevation sites. Annual average species occupancy probability (at the scale of 4-km2 sampling units) did not vary substantially between years but was lowest in 2014 (0.54, 95 % CRI: 0.20–0.84) and highest in 2013 (0.59, 95 % CRI: 0.27–0.87). Mean species-specific occupancy averaged across the years varied substantially among species, ranging from a low of 0.03 (95 % CRI: 0.00–0.08) for the masked palm civet Paguma larvata to a high of 0.94 (95 % CRI: 0.87–0.98) for the Asian elephant Elephas maximus. Mean occupancy probability was highest for herbivores followed by omnivores and carnivores. Species-specific detection probability (for a 30–60-day survey period) was not influenced by survey effort but increased with body mass for carnivores and decreased with body mass for herbivores and omnivores. We propose a framework for efficient monitoring of species and community-level EBV, utilizing data collected during the monitoring of high-profile species of conservation concern, such as tigers Panthera tigris in India. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In human-dominated and highly fragmented landscapes, keeping wildlife within reserve boundaries is vital for conservation success. In South Africa, fences are a widely employed conservation management tool for protected areas and are successful in mitigating human-wildlife conflict. However, fences are permeable, and predators are able to cross through reserve fences. African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) often leave fenced boundaries, resulting in high capture and translocation costs. Moreover, when wild dog packs (up to 30 individuals) leave fenced reserves they enter human-dominated landscapes where they face strong persecution and livestock predation incurs high costs. The factors driving packs to leave managed reserves are poorly understood, thus, to effectively manage wild dogs in fenced systems, it is important to understand why they leave reserve boundaries. There are several hypotheses as to why wild dogs cross through reserve fences, including inter- and intra-specific competition, social behaviour, management, prey density and environmental variability. Using a long-term dataset comprising 32 resident packs across five reserves, we investigated the relative strength of these hypotheses on the probability of wild dogs exiting a fenced reserve. During the 14-year study period, we recorded 154 exit events. We found that the interaction of fence integrity and time since pack formation were the primary factors affecting the probability of a pack leaving a reserve. When fence integrity was poor, escape probability decreased with pack age likely due to the exploratory behaviour of new packs. When fence integrity was average, escape probability increased with pack age likely due to the fitness benefits of holding larger and more exclusive territories as packs age. When fence integrity was good, the probability of a pack escaping was very low (only 1% occurrence). The implications of this research suggest that the primary management consideration for reducing wild dog escapes from fenced reserves should be maintaining adequate reserve-wide fence integrity, rather than focusing on social structure or drivers of inter- and intra-specific competition. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={The interactive effects of multiple threats are one of the main causes of biodiversity loss, yet our understanding of what predisposes species to be impacted by multiple threats remains limited. Here we analyse a global dataset of over 7000 marine, freshwater and terrestrial vertebrate populations, alongside trait, threat and geographical data, to identify the factors influencing the number of threats a species is subjected to at the population level. Out of a suite of predictors tested, we find that body mass and latitude both are broadly available for vertebrate species and influence the number of threats a population is subjected to. Larger-bodied species and those nearer the equator are typically affected by a higher number of threats. However, whilst this pattern broadly holds across ecosystems for most taxa, amphibians and reptiles show opposing trends. We suggest that latitude and body mass should be considered as key predictors to identify which vertebrate populations are likely to be impacted by multiple threats. These general predictors can help to better understand the impacts of the Anthropocene on global vertebrate biodiversity and design effective conservation policies. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Biological invasions are a multi-stage process (i.e., transport, introduction, establishment, spread), with each stage potentially acting as a selective filter on traits associated with invasion success. Behavior (e.g., exploration, activity, boldness) plays a key role in facilitating species introductions, but whether invasion acts as a selective filter on such traits is not well known. Here we capitalize on the well-characterized introduction of an invasive lizard (Lampropholis delicata) across three independent lineages throughout the Pacific, and show that invasion shifted behavioral trait means and reduced among-individual variation—two key predictions of the selective filter hypothesis. Moreover, lizards from all three invasive ranges were also more behaviorally plastic (i.e., greater within-individual variation) than their native range counterparts. We provide support for the importance of selective filtering of behavioral traits in a widespread invasion. Given that invasive species are a leading driver of global biodiversity loss, understanding how invasion selects for specific behaviors is critical for improving predictions of the effects of alien species on invaded communities. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={The establishment of pastures and forestry plantations has increased globally to meet growing demands for meat and wood products. Pasture and plantation expansion often drives deforestation, which causes homogenization of biotic communities and is a major driver of the global extinction crisis. A core question is how the severity of losses varies between pastures and plantations, and in turn, how geographical location and plantation management characteristics moderate these impacts. Focusing on herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles) as the most endangered vertebrate group, we performed a global synthesis using 41 scientific articles that reported species richness or abundance in pastures and forestry plantations relative to natural forest in 191 case studies among 19 countries. We found a severe negative effect of pasture and a less negative effect of forestry plantations on species richness and abundance of herpetofauna. Within plantations, species richness and total abundance were more negatively impacted in amphibians than reptiles, in the tropics, when planting exotic tree species, monocultures, large or commercial plantations, and when clearing understory vegetation. Yet mixed, old, small or conservation plantations and those permitting recovery of understory vegetation had no negative impacts relative to the reference natural forest. Synthesis and applications. The loss of herpetofauna species richness and abundance underscores the importance of halting ongoing tropical deforestation for pasture and intensive forestry plantations. The potential for appropriately managed forestry plantations to support biodiversity in regions lacking forest cover, including via replacement of anthropogenic pastures, suggests that such plantations have an important role under global reforestation agendas. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Species conservation and management require reliable information about animal distribution and population size. Better management actions within a species' range can be achieved by identifying the location and timing of population changes. In the Greater Mahale Ecosystem (GME), western Tanzania, deforestation due to the expansion of human settlements and agriculture, annual burning, and logging are known threats to wildlife. For one of the most charismatic species, the endangered eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), approximately 75% of the individuals are distributed outside national park boundaries, requiring monitoring and protection efforts over a vast landscape of various protection statuses. These efforts are especially challenging when we lack data on trends in density and population size. To predict spatio-temporal chimpanzee density and abundance across the GME, we used density surface modeling, fitting a generalized additive model to a 10-year time-series data set of nest counts based on line-transect surveys. The chimpanzee population declined at an annual rate of 2.41%, including declines of 1.72% in riparian forests (from this point forward, forests), 2.05% in miombo woodlands (from this point forward, woodlands) and 3.45% in nonforests. These population declines were accompanied by ecosystem-wide declines in vegetation types of 1.36% and 0.32% per year for forests and woodlands, respectively; we estimated an annual increase of 1.35% for nonforests. Our model predicted the highest chimpanzee density in forests (0.86 chimpanzees/km2, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 0.60–1.23; as of 2020), followed by woodlands (0.19, 95% CI 0.12–0.30) and nonforests (0.18, 95% CI 0.10–1.33). Although forests represent only 6% of the landscape, they support nearly one-quarter of the chimpanzee population (769 chimpanzees, 95% CI 536–1103). Woodlands dominate the landscape (71%) and therefore support more than a half of the chimpanzee population (2294; 95% CI 1420–3707). The remaining quarter of the landscape is represented by nonforests and supports another quarter of the chimpanzee population (750; 95% CI 408–1381). Given the pressures on the remaining suitable habitat in Tanzania, and the need of chimpanzees to access both forest and woodland vegetation to survive, we urge future management actions to increase resources and expand the efforts to protect critical forest and woodland habitat and promote strategies and policies that more effectively prevent irreversible losses. We suggest that regular monitoring programs implement a systematic random design to effectively inform and allocate conservation actions and facilitate interannual comparisons for trend monitoring, measuring conservation success, and guiding adaptive management. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Recent biodiversity loss has emphasized the necessity to critically evaluate the consequences of human alterations of forest ecosystems. Stand diversification via tree species mixtures and the use of non-native trees are two such alterations currently gaining importance as climate change adaptations. However, the effects of local versus regional tree mixing on associated biodiversity and notably the modifying role of tree species growing outside their natural range remain poorly understood. We assessed how monocultures and mixtures of native and introduced tree species influence the taxonomic and functional diversity of bird communities at stand and landscape scales in north-west Germany. We focused on the dominant natural tree species (Fagus sylvatica) and economically important conifer species planted outside their natural range (the native Picea abies and non-native Pseudotsuga menziesii). We found that bird species richness and functional diversity were generally higher in pure and mixed stands of native F. sylvatica than in pure conifer stands, especially in comparison to non-native P. menziesii. These differences were particularly strong at the landscape scale. Pure conifer stands harboured only a reduced set of functionally similar bird species. Structural diversity based on tree microhabitat availability emerged as a key predictor of bird diversity. Synthesis and applications. Our study suggests that tree species mixtures do not necessarily increase bird diversity compared to pure stands of native trees, but can promote bird diversity relative to pure stands of species planted outside their natural range. Moreover, local mixtures, rather than a mosaic of pure stands, may promote bird diversity also at the landscape scale. By contrast, pure stands of tree species planted outside their natural range can increase biotic homogenization of forest birds. Promoting structural diversity of microhabitats via tree retention and ensuring that non-native trees are planted in mixtures with native trees may alleviate potential limitations of climate change-oriented management for biodiversity. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Context: Old-growth forest loss drives the global biodiversity crisis. Nevertheless, this impact could be buffered by the increasing expansion of secondary (regenerating) forests, which can provide supplementary habitat for wildlife. Objectives: We tested this hypothesis assessing the effect of old-growth and secondary forest cover on the abundance and immature-to-female ratio (proxy of reproductive success) of two endangered primates: Geoffroy’ spider monkeys and black howler monkeys. Methods: We measured the response and predictor variables across 18 whole landscapes (landscape-scale approach) in the Lacandona rainforest, Mexico. As there could be tipping points of forest loss beyond which species extinction is accelerated (extinction thresholds), we separately tested the linear and non-linear effect of forest cover on each response, independently for three spatial scales. Results: We found stronger and larger-scale negative responses to forest loss in spider monkeys than in howler monkeys. However, the data were better predicted by linear models, giving no support to the extinction threshold hypothesis. In both species, forest loss had stronger negative impacts on monkey abundance when considering old-growth forest, than when considering secondary forest cover, or total (old-growth + secondary) forest cover. Yet, the immature-to-female ratio was weakly related to forest cover in both species. Conclusion: Secondary forests seem to have a weak buffering effect in both species, possibly because they are relatively young (< 30 years old) and do not have large trees. This implies that old-growth forests are irreplaceable for preventing primate extirpation, especially for species with specialized diet and large spatial requirements, such as spider monkeys. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Nowadays, there are more than fourteen major state and private owned textile industries and garment factories in Ethiopia. However, these textile effluents are directly discharged without treatment to the surrounding environment, as a result, the pollutants bring serious problem to the surrounding community including health such as skin diseases, asthma, abortion, carcinogenic effect, biodiversity loss and mutagenic effect on the. The main objective of this study is characterization and treatment of the textile effluent using aluminum electrodes in the electrocoagulation process. EC experimental setups were designed and different parameters were optimized. Electrocoagulation treatment process eliminates physicochemical quality indicators such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC); turbidity, biological oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia; nitrate, nitrite, total nitrogen (TN) and phosphate were determined using standard procedures. From the result, the maximum removal efficiency of phosphate, ammonia, TN, electrical conductivity, turbidity and BOD were obtained 97, 87, 88, 89, 99 and 66%, respectively. Analyses of the electrochemically generated sludge by X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that the expected crystalline aluminum oxides (bayerite (Al(OH)3 diaspore (AlO(OH)) were found in the sludge. The amorphous phase was also found in the floc. Therefore, a treatment technology was good and encourages the community to apply the technique for the treatment of textile effluent before discharging into the environment. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Rapid urbanization has caused drastic changes in urban ecosystems, resulting in various urgent management needs from mitigating biodiversity loss to preventing human-wildlife conflicts. Using species distribution modeling to understand urban species’ distributional patterns and predict their future changes is thus important to support decision-making. Raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) that previously inhabited Shanghai had been extirpated from the metropolitan area but recently returned to and expanded in almost all districts, causing hundreds of human-raccoon dog conflicts. In this study, we initiated a citizen science project, identified factors associated with raccoon dog habitat selection, and predicted its current suitable habitat as well as potential future ranges under different city development scenarios. By constructing an ensemble modeling using data from camera trap surveys, interviews and rescuing records, we found that raccoon dog distribution was positively associated with several anthropogenic factors including nighttime light, human population, and percentage area of buildings. We predicted a 156,024 ha suitable habitat for raccoon dogs throughout Shanghai, among which only 5,811 ha (3.72 %) was currently occupied. Our results indicated considerable potential of raccoon dogs’ future expansion, which had been consistently ignored in previous management plans. To alleviate the increasing human-raccoon dog conflicts, we found strategies to slow down raccoon dog movement effective tools, and suggest adaptive management to provide fast response and flexible solutions.

abstract={Habitat loss is one of the most important threats to biodiversity; it alters the habitat connectivity of species and is among the main causes of the global amphibian extinction crisis. Identifying the potential areas of distribution and connectivity of species is of the utmost importance so that informed decisions can be made for the conservation of vulnerable amphibian populations. In this study, we performed species distribution models and used circuit theory to model omnidirectional connectivity for two plethodontid salamanders of conservation concern distributed in the forests of Chiapas, Mexico, and Guatemala (Bolitoglossa franklini and Bolitoglossa lincolni). Potential distribution maps show an affinity for well-preserved montane forests for both species. Likewise, we found that the niches of the species are not similar. The connectivity models show that the main areas of connectivity are in the Meseta Central de Chiapas, Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and the Cordillera Volcánica Guatemalense, in this last range, important areas of connectivity were located, as well as least-cost paths and barriers to the movement of both species. We identified that important areas of climatic suitability and connectivity are not within the protected natural areas and may be threatened by the increasing influence of anthropogenic activities. The results of our study show the importance of preserving the regional forests to ensure the persistence of species with arboreal habits and high sensitivity to habitat transformation, as well as to recognize and prioritize potential areas for management and protection in both southern Mexico and Guatemala. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Effective conservation requires understanding species’ abundance patterns and demographic rates across space and time. Ideally, such knowledge should be available for whole communities because variation in species’ dynamics can elucidate factors leading to biodiversity losses. However, collecting data to simultaneously estimate abundance and demographic rates of communities of species is often prohibitively time intensive and expensive. We developed a multispecies dynamic N-occupancy model to estimate unbiased, community-wide relative abundance and demographic rates. In this model, detection–nondetection data (e.g., repeated presence–absence surveys) are used to estimate species- and community-level parameters and the effects of environmental factors. To validate our model, we conducted a simulation study to determine how and when such an approach can be valuable and found that our multispecies model outperformed comparable single-species models in estimating abundance and demographic rates in many cases. Using data from a network of camera traps across tropical equatorial Africa, we then used our model to evaluate the statuses and trends of a forest-dwelling antelope community. We estimated relative abundance, rates of recruitment (i.e., reproduction and immigration), and apparent survival probabilities for each species’ local population. The antelope community was fairly stable (although 17% of populations [species–park combinations] declined over the study period). Variation in apparent survival was linked more closely to differences among national parks than to individual species’ life histories. The multispecies dynamic N-occupancy model requires only detection–nondetection data to evaluate the population dynamics of multiple sympatric species and can thus be a valuable tool for examining the reasons behind recent biodiversity loss. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Reptiles are increasingly of conservation concern due to their susceptibility to habitat loss, emerging disease, and harvest in the wildlife trade. However, reptile populations are often difficult to monitor given the frequency of crypsis in their life history. This difficulty has left uncertain the conservation status of many species and the efficacy of conservation actions unknown. Environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys consistently elevate the detection rate of species they are designed to monitor, and while their use is promising for terrestrial reptile conservation, successes in developing such surveys have been sparse. We tested the degree to which inclusion of surface and soil eDNA sampling into conventional artificial-cover methods elevates the detection probability of a small, cryptic terrestrial lizard, Scincella lateralis. The eDNA sampling of cover object surfaces with paint rollers elevated per sample detection probabilities for this species 4–16 times compared with visual surveys alone. We readily detected S. lateralis eDNA under cover objects up to 2 weeks after the last visual detection, and at some cover objects where no S. lateralis were visually observed in prior months. With sufficient sampling intensity, eDNA testing of soil under cover objects produced comparable per sample detection probabilities as roller surface methods. Our results suggest that combining eDNA and cover object methods can considerably increase the detection power of reptile monitoring programs, allowing more accurate estimates of population size, detection of temporal and spatial changes in habitat use, and tracking success of restoration efforts. Further research into the deposition and decay rates of reptile eDNA under cover objects, as well as tailored protocols for different species and habitats, is needed to bring the technique into widespread use. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Global warming is increasingly exacerbating biodiversity loss. Populations locally adapted to spatially heterogeneous environments may respond differentially to climate change, but this intraspecific variation has only recently been considered when modelling vulnerability under climate change. Here, we incorporate intraspecific variation in genomic offset and ecological niche modelling to estimate climate change-driven vulnerability in two bird species in the Sino-Himalayan Mountains. We found that the cold-tolerant populations show higher genomic offset but risk less challenge for niche suitability decline under future climate than the warm-tolerant populations. Based on a genome-niche index estimated by combining genomic offset and niche suitability change, we identified the populations with the least genome-niche interruption as potential donors for evolutionary rescue, i.e., the populations tolerant to climate change. We evaluated potential rescue routes via a landscape genetic analysis. Overall, we demonstrate that the integration of genomic offset, niche suitability modelling, and landscape connectivity can improve climate change-driven vulnerability assessments and facilitate effective conservation management. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Islands are global hotspots for biodiversity and extinction, representing ~ 5% of Earth’s land area alongside 40% of globally threatened vertebrates and 61% of global extinctions since the 1500s. Invasive species are the primary driver of native biodiversity loss on islands, though eradication of invasive species from islands has been effective at halting or reversing these trends. A global compendium of this conservation tool is essential for scaling best-practices and enabling innovations to maximize biodiversity outcomes. Here, we synthesize over 100 years of invasive vertebrate eradications from islands, comprising 1550 eradication attempts on 998 islands, with an 88% success rate. We show a significant growth in eradication activity since the 1980s, primarily driven by rodent eradications. The annual number of eradications on islands peaked in the mid-2000s, but the annual area treated continues to rise dramatically. This trend reflects increases in removal efficacy and project complexity, generating increased conservation gains. Our synthesis demonstrates the collective contribution of national interventions towards global biodiversity outcomes. Further investment in invasive vertebrate eradications from islands will expand biodiversity conservation while strengthening biodiversity resilience to climate change and creating co-benefits for human societies. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Resolving ecological-economic trade-offs between biodiversity and yields is a key challenge when addressing the biodiversity crisis in tropical agricultural landscapes. Here, we focused on the relation between seven different taxa (trees, herbaceous plants, birds, amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and ants) and yields in vanilla agroforests in Madagascar. Agroforests established in forests supported overall 23% fewer species and 47% fewer endemic species than old-growth forests, and 14% fewer endemic species than forest fragments. In contrast, agroforests established on fallows had overall 12% more species and 38% more endemic species than fallows. While yields increased with vanilla vine density and length, non-yield related variables largely determined biodiversity. Nonetheless, trade-offs existed between yields and butterflies as well as reptiles. Vanilla yields were generally unrelated to richness of trees, herbaceous plants, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and ants, opening up possibilities for conservation outside of protected areas and restoring degraded land to benefit farmers and biodiversity alike. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant global impact. However, COVID-19 is just one of several high-impact infectious diseases that emerged from wildlife and are linked to the human relationship with nature. The rate of emergence of new zoonoses (diseases of animal origin) is increasing, driven by human-induced environmental changes that threaten biodiversity on a global scale. This increase is directly linked to environmental drivers including biodiversity loss, climate change and unsustainable resource extraction. Australia is a biodiversity hotspot and is subject to sustained and significant environmental change, increasing the risk of it being a location for pandemic origin. Moreover, the global integration of markets means that consumption trends in Australia contributes to the risk of disease spill-over in our regional neighbours in Asia-Pacific, and beyond. Despite the clear causal link between anthropogenic pressures on the environment and increasing pandemic risks, Australia’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, like most of the world, has centred largely on public health strategies, with a clear focus on reactive management. Yet, the span of expertise and evidence relevant to the governance of pandemic risk management is much wider than public health and epidemiology. It involves animal/wildlife health, biosecurity, conservation sciences, social sciences, behavioural psychology, law, policy and economic analyses to name just a few. The authors are a team of multidisciplinary practitioners and researchers who have worked together to analyse, synthesise, and harmonise the links between pandemic risk management approaches and issues in different disciplines to provide a holistic overview of current practice, and conclude the need for reform in Australia. We discuss the adoption of a comprehensive and interdisciplinary ‘One Health’ approach to pandemic risk management in Australia. A key goal of the One Health approach is to be proactive in countering threats of emerging infectious diseases and zoonoses through a recognition of the interdependence between human, animal, and environmental health. Developing ways to implement a One Health approach to pandemic prevention would not only reduce the risk of future pandemics emerging in or entering Australia, but also provide a model for prevention strategies around the world. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Aim: Changes in climatic conditions are predicted to impact species distribution and hence alter their diversity patterns. Modifications in the composition of biological communities are expected as a result of the loss and replacement of species due to global warming. Forest frugivorous birds already suffer from habitat loss and may disappear locally due to suitable area contraction or range shifts to novel areas, disrupting seed dispersal and consequently the functioning of natural ecosystems. Here, we investigate the impacts of different climate scenarios on alpha and beta diversities of forest frugivorous birds. Location: Central Corridor of the Atlantic Forest (CCAF), Brazil. Methods: We used ecological niche models to project species distribution of 68 frugivorous birds for the baseline and future (2050 and 2070) scenarios. We generated binary maps of suitable areas for each species by climate scenario to calculate alpha and beta diversities. Results: Most forest frugivorous birds were projected to lose suitable area, as a consequence of climate change, reducing alpha diversity in future scenarios and increasing temporal beta diversity, which is dominated by the nestedness component. In addition, species richness decreased from the east to the west portion of the CCAF, while differentiation of bird communities increased in the same direction, a pattern consistent across all climate scenarios evaluated. Main conclusions: Climate change may exert drastic alterations in the composition of frugivorous bird communities in the CCAF. As forest frugivorous birds are critical to seed dispersal of forest plant species, impoverishment of their communities can drastically affect forest regeneration, diversity, and structure in the decades to come. Therefore, a better comprehension of spatio-temporal changes in diversity patterns of frugivorous birds can help us to avoid the disruption of seed dispersal and its consequences, such as cascading effects that will trigger biodiversity loss in the CCAF. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={In the face of the current global extinction crisis, it is critical we give conservation management strategies the best chance of success. Australia is not exempt from global trends with currently the world’s greatest mammal extinction rate (~ 1 per 8 years). Many more are threatened including the dibbler (Parantechinus apicalis) whose remnant range has been restricted to Western Australia at just one mainland site and two small offshore islands—Whitlock Island (5 ha) and Boullanger Island (35 ha). Here, we used 14 microsatellite markers to quantify genetic variation in the remaining island populations from 2013 to 2018 and incorporated these data into population viability analysis (PVA) models, used to assess factors important to dibbler survival and to provide guidance for translocations. Remnant population genetic diversity was low (&lt; 0.3), and populations were highly divergent from each other (pairwise FSTs 0.29–0.52). Comparison of empirical data to an earlier study is consistent with recent declines in genetic diversity and models projected increasing extinction risk and declining genetic variation in the next century. Optimal translocation scenarios recommend 80 founders for new dibbler populations—provided by captive breeding—and determined the proportion of founders from parental populations to maximise genetic diversity and minimise harvesting impact. The goal of our approach is long-term survival of genetically diverse, self-sustaining populations and our methods are transferable. We consider mixing island with mainland dibblers to reinforce genetic variation. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Understanding the stability of ecosystem multifunctionality is imperative for maintaining ecosystem health and sustainability under augmented global change. However it remains unknown whether and how biological communities mediate multifunctional stability in response to biodiversity loss and disturbances. Here, we conducted a 3-year experiment by exposing 270 plant communities of four plant richness levels, i.e., 1, 2, 4, or 8 species, to drought and exotic plant invasion disturbances. Then, the direct effects of plant richness, drought and invasion, and their indirect effects mediated by the stability of plant, litter-faunal, and soil-faunal communities on multifunctional stability were disentangled. We found that plant richness increased, while drought and invasion decreased ecosystem multifunctional stability, which were mediated by plant or faunal community stability. By incorporating the stability of communities into the complex ecological mechanisms, the completeness and goodness of ecological models for explaining and maintaining the stability of ecosystem multifunctionality will be improved. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has estimated that invasive alien species (IAS) might cause billions of dollars of losses every year across the world. One example is South-East Asia, where IAS have caused an estimated loss of 33.5 billion USD, affecting the environment, human health, and agricultural production. Factors associated with climate change, such as increased carbon dioxide (CO2), heavy precipitation, and elevated temperatures is expected to facilitate biological invasion, leading only to further financial and public health loss. Thus, further study is needed to identify, collate and categorise what evidence exists on the impacts of climate change on fish and shellfish species that contribute to the list of “One Hundred of the World’s Worst Invasive Alien Species” as identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN). Such mapping will identify regions more at risk of biological invasion as climate change progresses. Methods: We outline a systematic mapping review protocol that follows the Guideline and Standards for Evidence Synthesis in Environmental Management and RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES). We describe how peer-reviewed articles will be collected from Web of Science and Scopus, and then analyzed to create knowledge maps on the impact climate change has on invasive species. Finally, we speculate on how our results will aid future management of invasive species in the light of climate change. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Agricultural landscapes cover a large portion of the planet and the intensification of farming is a primary cause of biodiversity loss. Changes in agricultural practices have been particularly marked in Western Europe over the last century. Hedgerow landscapes consist of complex mosaics of pastures, ponds, and hedges connected with forest patches that are favourable for biodiversity. Recently, however, these traditional farming landscapes have been profoundly simplified with a massive reduction in hedgerows. Reptiles are currently facing an important global decline, but the impact of the intensification of agricultural practices on their populations remains understudied. We studied the common European adder Vipera berus and the western green lizard Lacerta bilineata in Western France in a hedgerow landscape undergoing agricultural intensification. We first quantified the habitat changes (density of hedgerows and forest edges) from 1950 to 2015. Second, we documented changes in the distribution of V. berus and L. bilineata in the area between two surveys conducted 18 years apart (survey 1: 1994–1997 and survey 2: 2012–2015). The two species were more likely to be found at sites with dense hedgerows and forest edges at the first survey. We detected marked range contractions in the distributions of both species over 18 years (92% and 74%, respectively, for V. berus and L. bilineata). Population monitoring of the adder with capture-mark-recapture at two sites revealed marked declines related to the degradation of hedgerows and closure of the forest patches.

abstract={Wildlife trade is a major driver of biodiversity loss, yet whilst the impacts of trade in some species are relatively well-known, some taxa, such as many invertebrates are often overlooked. Here we explore global patterns of trade in the arachnids, and detected 1,264 species from 66 families and 371 genera in trade. Trade in these groups exceeds millions of individuals, with 67% coming directly from the wild, and up to 99% of individuals in some genera. For popular taxa, such as tarantulas up to 50% are in trade, including 25% of species described since 2000. CITES only covers 30 (2%) of the species potentially traded. We mapped the percentage and number of species native to each country in trade. To enable sustainable trade, better data on species distributions and better conservation status assessments are needed. The disparity between trade data sources highlights the need to expand monitoring if impacts on wild populations are to be accurately gauged and the impacts of trade minimised. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={“Failure” is recognised as being vital for success in many fields but is seldom embraced in primate conservation or conservation more generally. In this paper, we use examples from the literature, particularly around reintroduction, to reflect on failure and consider the contribution it can make to primate conservation success. Barriers to acknowledging failure are highlighted and include concerns regarding reputational damage that impact on communication with funders, publishing, and discussing our projects more widely. We also discuss the need for a broader and adaptive approach to include multiple steps of experimentation, reflection, and subsequent learning. This process, which necessarily includes failures and the results of unintended consequences, will require primatologists to use a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and reflective approach to effectively address factors that contribute to failure, including those external to the traditional focus of primatologists. The paper concludes with specific recommendations for progressing in this area, including (i) Funding—funders to incorporate greater flexibility in response to project change and to specifically ask grantees to consider risk, failure, and lessons learnt, and funders and grantees to improve dialogue; (ii) Publishing—journals to have a section that considers failure and lessons learnt and, along with societies, to further engage with researchers from the Global South about the best ways to support with publishing; and (iii) Communication—primate conservationists to lead by example and reflect/discuss failure openly and to create spaces that encourage sharing of these topics. Whilst not exhaustive, we hope that these recommendations will contribute to developing a culture of constructive discussion around failure in primate conservation. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Rising greenhouse gas emissions do not only accelerate climate change but also make the ocean more acidic. This applies above all to carbon dioxide (CO2). Lower ocean pH levels threaten marine ecosystems and especially strongly calcifying species. Impacts on marine ecosystem quality are currently underrepresented in life cycle assessments (LCAs). Here, we developed characterization factors for the life cycle impact assessment of ocean acidification. Our main contribution was developing new species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), from which we derived effect factors for different impact perspectives: Marginal, linear, and average changes for both the past and four future emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). Based on a dataset that covered five taxa (corals, crustaceans, echinoderms, fishes, molluscs) and three climate zones, we showed significantly higher sensitivities for strongly calcifying than slightly calcifying taxa and in polar regions compared to tropical and temperate regions. Experimental duration, leading to acute, subchronic, or chronic toxicological endpoints, did not significantly affect the species sensitivities. With ocean acidification impacts still accelerating, the future-oriented average effects are higher than the marginal or past-oriented average effects. While our characterization factors are ready for use in LCA, we also point to opportunities for improvement in future developments. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Due to changing environmental conditions, many species will have to migrate or occupy new suitable areas to avoid potential extinction in the current biodiversity crisis. Long-lived animals are especially vulnerable and ex-situ conservation actions can provide solutions through assisted colonisations. However, there is little empirical evidence on the process of founding new populations for such species or the feasibility of assisted colonisations as a viable conservation measure. Here, we combined genetics with reproductive data to study the rise of two wild populations of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in the Cayman Islands as a possible outcome of a reintroduction program started 50 years ago. We show that both populations are highly related to the captive population but rapidly diverged due to genetic drift. Individuals from the reintroduced populations showed high levels of nest fidelity, within and across nesting seasons, indicating that philopatry may help reinforce the success of new populations. Additionally, we show that reintroduction from captive populations has not undermined the reproductive fitness of first generation individuals. Sea turtle reintroduction programs can, therefore, establish new populations but require scientific evaluation of costs and benefits and should be monitored over time to ensure viability in the long-term. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Aim: Evaluate how large-scale forest regeneration based on a low-cost restoration method may mitigate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation associated to future climate changes on the distribution of birds and arboreal mammals in a tropical biodiversity hotspot; find areas with different current and future potential species richness and assess how passive restoration can reduce the risk of species extinction. Location: Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF). Methods: We built a forest regeneration scenario via a model of seed dispersal based on the potential movement of frugivorous fauna and projected the potential distribution of 356 bird species and 21 arboreal mammals based on Species Distribution Models (SDM) which employed 79,462 occurrence records and four algorithms for different climate and landscape scenarios. SDM were based on climate and landscape predictors separately and the results were combined into maps of species richness. Finally, we assessed the species’ risk of extinction based on the species–area relationship. Results: Without considering the effects of climate change, the potential distribution area for each species increases on average by 72.5% (SD = 8%) in the scenario of potential regeneration. Climate change decreases the area of potential occurrence of 252 species, which may suffer a mean reduction of 74.4% (SD = 9.3%) in their current potential distribution areas. BAF regions with the largest amounts of forest had the greatest potential richness of species. In future climate scenario, 3.4% of species may become extinct, but we show that large-scale regeneration may prevent these extinctions. Main conclusions: Despite the possible negative impacts of climate change on the distribution of 67% of the studied species, which would increase the risk of species extinction, our analysis indicated that promoting large-scale BAF restoration based on natural regeneration may prevent biodiversity loss. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={The Mesozoic rise of the European freshwater gastropod fauna is still poorly understood. Compared to the well documented Cenozoic history, little is known about the patterns and processes underlying the early diversification preceding their extinction crisis at the K–Pg boundary. We assess what is probably a first pulse of diversification of the Cenozoic-type fauna in the Late Cretaceous along with the potential abiotic and biotic controls for shifts in species diversification. We find strong support that the increase in the speciation rate in the Santonian (~ 85 Myr ago) is linked to a global sea level rise, which caused extensive flooding of continental areas and the formation of vast brackish-water ecosystems. The following decline of the speciation rate coincides with a rise in diversity and reflects increasing interspecific competition. The peak in the speciation rate postdates the Cenomanian–Turonian Thermal Maximum, which probably limited the potential for diversification among freshwater gastropods due to ecological constraints. The peak coincides moreover with the end phase of the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution, which sparked the radiation of angiosperms. The expansion and diversification of flowering plants, being an important food source for freshwater gastropods today, could have formed a necessary basis for gastropod diversification. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Land modified for human use alters matrix shape and composition and is a leading contributor to global biodiversity loss. It can also play a key role in facilitating range expansion and ecosystem invasion by anthrophilic species, as it can alter food abundance and distribution while also influencing predation risk; the relative roles of these processes are key to habitat selection theory. We researched these relative influences by examining human footprint, natural habitat, and predator occurrence on seasonal habitat selection by range-expanding boreal white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the oil sands of western Canada. We hypothesized that polygonal industrial features (e.g. cutblocks, well sites) drive deer distributions as sources of early seral forage, while linear features (e.g. roads, trails, and seismic lines) and habitat associated with predators are avoided by deer. We developed seasonal 2nd -order resource selection models from three years of deer GPS-telemetry data, a camera-trap-based model of predator occurrence, and landscape spatial data to weigh evidence for six competing hypotheses. Deer habitat selection was best explained by the combination of polygonal and linear features, intact deciduous forest, and wolf (Canis lupus) occurrence. Deer strongly selected for linear features such as roads and trails, despite a potential increased risk of wolf encounters. Linear features may attract deer by providing high density forage opportunity in heavily exploited landscapes, facilitating expansion into the boreal north. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={In this article we describe the natural hydrogeomorphological and biogeochemical cycles of dryland fluvial ecosystems that make them unique, yet vulnerable to land use activities and climate change. We introduce Natural Infrastructure in Dryland Streams (NIDS), which are structures naturally or anthropogenically created from earth, wood, debris, or rock that can restore implicit function of these systems. This manuscript further discusses the capability of and functional similarities between beaver dams and anthropogenic NIDS, documented by decades of scientific study. In addition, we present the novel, evidence-based finding that NIDS can create wetlands in water-scarce riparian zones, with soil organic carbon stock as much as 200 to 1400 Mg C/ha in the top meter of soil. We identify the key restorative action of NIDS, which is to slow the drainage of water from the landscape such that more of it can infiltrate and be used to facilitate natural physical, chemical, and biological processes in fluvial environments. Specifically, we assert that the rapid drainage of water from such environments can be reversed through the restoration of natural infrastructure that once existed. We then explore how NIDS can be used to restore the natural biogeochemical feedback loops in these systems. We provide examples of how NIDS have been used to restore such feedback loops, the lessons learned from installation of NIDS in the dryland streams of the southwestern United States, how such efforts might be scaled up, and what the implications are for mitigating climate change effects. Our synthesis portrays how restoration using NIDS can support adaptation to and protection from climate-related disturbances and stressors such as drought, water shortages, flooding, heatwaves, dust storms, wildfire, biodiversity losses, and food insecurity. © 2022},

abstract={Fisheries have important impacts on marine biodiversity. In this work, combined information on the abundance, species richness, diversity indices, species composition, trophic level and vulnerability index were examined for the first-time to detect differences in five units related to trawl fishing: the fish assemblage entering the trawl codend, and the escaping, retained, discarded and landed fractions, derived by the gear and fisher selection practices. The work was based on a case study conducted in the Mediterranean Sea, using three different meshes in the trawl codend (40mm-40D and 50mm-50D diamond meshes, and 40 mm-40S square meshes) and a cover of the codends with small mesh size. In general, trawl fishing produces an escaping fraction that was always lower in abundance, richness, and vulnerability index, similar in diversity indices and trophic level, and different in species composition compared to the fish assemblage entering the codend. In almost all cases, fishers selected as landings a fraction that was the lowest in diversity indices, and the highest in trophic level. In contrast, fishers discarded a fraction that was the highest in diversity and vulnerability index, and the lowest in trophic level. Although the three codends did not differ significantly in the fraction of escapees in terms of diversity indices, trophic level, and vulnerability index, the 40S codend showed a significantly higher percentage in the escaping number of species and individuals, and less differences in the species composition; in addition, lower percentage in abundance of discards and higher of landings in the retained catch (0.6:1) than did the other two codends (0.9:1). It was suggested that an urgent modification of the trawl for the elimination of the discarded highly vulnerable species (e.g. Elasmobranchs) is needed, and that trawl species-selectivity should be improved by allowing escape or avoiding catch of the discarded fraction to minimize biodiversity losses.

abstract={Marine protected areas (MPAs) are among the most effective management responses to human environmental impacts. However, their capacity to sustain biodiversity and associated ecosystem services under climate change is uncertain. Understanding how climate shifts impact ecosystem functioning and socioeconomic well-being is vital for biodiversity conservation and adaptation planning. Here, we show that climate change could render the current MPAs network in 12 nations in the Western Indian Ocean ineffective in supporting conservation and socioeconomic outcomes. Approximately half of the coral reefs and MPAs in countries most at risk of food insecurity will likely experience significant biodiversity losses. Only 4% of reefs and 6% of MPAs were located within areas less likely to experience climate shifts. Biodiversity hotspots for coral and reef fish were generally over-represented in the most at-risk areas. Conservation actions planned to anticipate climate risks can help to maintain biodiversity and socioeconomic benefits. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Invasive rodents are a major cause of environmental damage and biodiversity loss, particularly on islands. Unlike insects, genetic biocontrol strategies including population-suppressing gene drives with biased inheritance have not been developed in mice. Here, we demonstrate a gene drive strategy (tCRISPR) that leverages super-Mendelian transmission of the t haplotype to spread inactivating mutations in a haplosufficient female fertility gene (Prl). Using spatially explicit individual-based in silico modeling, we show that tCRISPR can eradicate island populations under a range of realistic field-based parameter values. We also engineer transgenic tCRISPR mice that, crucially, exhibit biased transmission of the modified t haplotype and Prl mutations at levels our modeling predicts would be sufficient for eradication. This is an example of a feasible gene drive system for invasive alien rodent population control. Copyright © 2022 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.},

abstract={Fishing activity is closely monitored to an increasing degree, but its effects on biodiversity have not received such attention. Using iconic and well-studied fish species such as tunas, billfishes, and sharks, we calculate a continuous Red List Index of yearly changes in extinction risk over 70 years to track progress toward global sustainability and biodiversity targets. We show that this well-established biodiversity indicator is highly sensitive and responsive to fishing mortality. After ~58 years of increasing risk of extinction, effective fisheries management has shifted the biodiversity loss curve for tunas and billfishes, whereas the curve continues to worsen for sharks, which are highly undermanaged. While populations of highly valuable commercial species are being rebuilt, the next management challenge is to halt and reverse the harm afflicted by these same fisheries to broad oceanic biodiversity.

abstract={Freshwater ecosystems appear more vulnerable to biodiversity loss due to several anthropogenic disturbances and freshwater fish are particularly vulnerable to these impacts. We aimed to (1) identify the contribution of land use, spatial variables, and invasion degree in determining freshwater fish alpha (i.e., species richness) and beta (i.e., local contributions to beta diversity, LCBD) diversity, evaluating also the relationship between invasion degree and nestedness ((Formula presented.) nes) and turnover ((Formula presented.) sim) components of beta diversity. (2) Investigate the relationship between alpha diversity and LCBD, under the hypothesis that alpha diversity and LCBD correlate negatively and (3) investigate the relationship between species contributions to beta diversity (SCBD) and species occurrence, hypothesizing that non-native species show a lower contribution to beta diversity. The linear mixed models and the partition of R2 retained the invasion degree as the most important variables explaining alpha and beta diversity, having a positive relationship with both diversity components. Furthermore, land use related to human impacts had a positive influence on alpha diversity, whereas it showed a negative effect on LCBD. Regression model further showed that invasion degree related positively with (Formula presented.) sim, but negatively with (Formula presented.) nes, suggesting that non-native species were involved in the replacement of native species in the fish community. Alpha diversity and LCBD showed a weak positive correlation, meaning that sites with low species richness have higher LCBD. SCBD scaled positively with species occurrence highlighting that rarer species contribute less to SCBD. Finally, native and exotic species contributed similarly to beta diversity. These results suggest that invasion degree plays a central role in shaping alpha and beta diversity in stream fish, more than land use features reflecting habitat alteration or other geospatial variables. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate separately the native and the non-native components of biotic communities to identify linkages between invasion dynamics and biodiversity loss. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Invasive species are one of the main causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. As introduced, populations may increase in abundance and expand geographical range, so does the potential for negative impacts on native communities. As such, it is necessary to understand the processes driving range expansion, before a species becomes established in new areas. Through an investigation into capacity for population growth and range expansion of introduced populations of a non-native lizard, we aimed to demonstrate how multi-scale factors influence spatial spread, population growth, and invasion potential in introduced species. The Italian Wall Lizard (Podarcis siculus) was introduced multiple times to the United States with extant populations in California, Kansas, New Jersey, and New York. Recently, a single specimen was discovered in British Columbia, Canada, and unstudied populations are on Orcas Island and Missouri (USA). We used phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA sequences (cytb gene) of individuals sampled from these introduced populations and across the native range to identify potential source populations. Our phylogenetic analysis result with documentation of the introductions revealed that the Canadian individual is derived from the Tuscany clade (together with samples from Kansas and New York). The New Jersey population is likely from the Adriatic clade and the Californian one from Sicily. The Orcas Island and Missouri populations still require study. Consequently, humans are key drivers of the distribution of alien reptiles in North America, but the distributions are determined by a complex interplay between human activities, geographic factors and species features. Genetic evidence is essential for reliable biogeographic assessment of invasive species, particularly in systems with a long history of human influence. © Oskyrko et al.},

abstract={Indigenous Peoples in Northwestern North America have always worked with predictable cycles of day and night, tides, moon phases, seasons, and species growth and reproduction, including such phenological indicators as the blooming of flowers and the songs of birds. Negotiating variability has been constant in people's lives. Long-term monitoring and detailed knowledge of other lifeforms and landscapes of people's home territories have assisted in responding and adapting to change. Aspects of cultural knowledge and practice that have helped Indigenous Peoples navigate nature's cycles at different scales of time and space include kin ties and social relationships, experiential learning, language, storytelling and timing of ceremonies such as “First Foods” celebrations. Working with ecological processes, Indigenous Peoples have been able to maintain optimal conditions for preferred species, reducing variability and uncertainty through taking care of productive habitats, leaving ecosystems intact, and allowing other species to change in their own cycles. Since the onset of colonization, however, Indigenous Peoples' lifeways have been changed drastically, culminating with the current impacts of global climate change and biodiversity loss. This paper, based on contributions of numerous Indigenous Knowledge holders from across Northwestern North America, outlines some of the key ways in which Indigenous Peoples have embraced predictability and change in their environments and lifeways, and addresses the particular threat of climate change: its recognition, ways of adapting to it, and, ultimately, how it might be reversed through developing more careful, respectful relationships with and responsibilities for the other-than-human world. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Unsustainable wildlife trade is a major driver of biodiversity loss and an important public health threat. Yet, effective wildlife trade regulation is currently at odds with food security and economic incentives provided by this global, multibillion-dollar industry. Given such limitations, public health and conservation resources can be aligned to target species for which trade both increases risk of extinction and threatens public health. Here, we developed a simple conservation and health trade risk (CHT) index (range: 2–50) using a case study of traded mammals based on species' extinction and zoonotic risks, weighed by the extent of their trade. We applied this index to 1161 International Union for the Conservation of Nature-listed terrestrial mammals involved in the wildlife trade to identify 284 high-priority species that scored high in the CHT index (CHT ≥ 18). Species ranking high for conservation, public health, and trade risks include those belonging to the orders Primates, Cetartiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), Rodentia (rodents), Chiroptera (bats), and Carnivora (carnivores). Of the high-priority species, 33% (n = 95) are country-endemics and may be good candidates for trade regulations and enforcement at national scales. Our study provides a preliminary step in prioritizing species, taxonomic groups, and countries for focused wildlife trade regulation to meet both conservation and public health goals. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Aim: Determining the mechanisms by which climate change and human activities affect patterns of ecological specialization in different genetic units of the same species is crucial for developing local or regionally-based conservation solutions. This study uses species distribution models and genetic analysis to (1) identify the evidence of intraspecific differences in the population size and distribution of the three extant lineages (Sichuan/Gansu (SG), Qinling (QL) and Shennongjia (SNJ)) of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys and (2) determine why some lineages have lower population numbers, a smaller geographical distribution, and are more threatened with extinction. Location: China. Methods: We used n-dimensional hypervolume modelling and genotype-environment association (GEA) models to compare the climatic niches of three snub-nosed monkey lineages, SDMs to reconstruct the historical, current and future distributions of each lineage and SMC++ to calculate their effective population sizes. Results: We found evidence of: (1) climatic niche differentiation among the SG, QL and SNJ lineages of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys; (2) geographical isolation combined with a decrease in population size during the LGM resulted in ecological specialization among these three lineages; and (3) a decline in climatic suitability and anthropogenically driven land conversion, combined with small population size and a narrow distributional range, indicates that the SNJ lineage is at a greater risk of extinction than the SG and QL lineages. Main conclusions: We demonstrate that during the LGM a reduction in habitat suitability driven by climate change, in concert with decreasing population size, resulted in the geographical isolation of the three Sichuan snub-nosed monkey subpopulations, leading to lineage differences in ecological specialization. GEA models and hypervolume models demonstrated that the three lineages occupy different ecological niches. Based on lineage-level models, the SNJ and QL lineages should be the immediate focus of conservation efforts due to their small effective population size and expected future reductions in available suitable habitats. The modelling approach used here is robust and can be applied effectively to examine the biogeography, recent evolutionary history and effective population size of other endangered animal taxa. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Aim: Predict empirically the current and recent historical (c1970) landscape connectivity and population size of the African lion as a baseline against which to assess conservation of the species. Location: Continental Africa. Methods: We compiled historical records of lion distribution to generate a recent historical range for the species. Historical population size was predicted using a generalized additive model. Resistant kernel and factorial least-cost path analyses were used to predict recent historical landscape connectivity and compare this with contemporary connectivity at continental, regional and country scales. Results: We estimate a baseline population of ~92,054 (83,017–101,094 95% CI) lions in c1970, suggesting Africa's lion population has declined by ~75%, over the last five decades. Although greatly reduced from historical extents (c1500AD), recent historical lion habitat was substantially connected. However, in comparison, contemporary population connectivity has declined dramatically, with many populations now isolated, as well as large declines within remaining population core areas. This decline was most marked in the West and Central region, with a 90% decline in connected habitat compared with its c1970 extent. The Eastern and Southern regions have experienced lower, though significant, declines in connected habitat (44% and 55%, respectively). Contemporary populations are connected by three non-core habitat linkages and 15 potential corridors (spanning unconnected habitat) that may allow dispersal and gene flow. Declining connectivity mirrors recent studies showing loss of genetic diversity and increasing genetic isolation of lion populations. Main conclusions: We provide an empirically derived baseline for African lion population size, habitat extent and connectivity in c1970 and at present against which to evaluate contemporary conservation of the species, avoiding a shifting baseline syndrome where conservation success/failure is measured only against recent population size or range. We recommend priorities for conservation of existing connections to avoid further fragmentation. © 2022 The Authors. Diversity and Distributions published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Fragmentation of river systems is a key driver of freshwater biodiversity loss. Instream structure inventories are an essential component of delivering a strategic approach to restoring river connectivity. We used a range of data sources to collate the best available information on fish passage barriers and instream structures across the whole of New Zealand. To support implementation of new national policy objectives to maintain and improve river connectivity, the structure inventory has been integrated with a new fish passage assessment mobile application that allows river managers and asset owners to ground-truth, update and add records to the database. The data are provided open access and are being used for environmental reporting and to support strategic prioritisation of barrier mitigation actions. We used these data to quantify river connectivity at regional and national scales and demonstrated that at least half of New Zealand's river network is upstream of fish migration barriers. Limitations to our calculation of upstream river connectivity included the unknown influence of unrecorded structures, particularly on private land, missing information within recorded data, the large number of instream structures that have been identified but not yet assessed for their risk to fish passage, and spatial errors in the automated pairing of structures to a digital river network. A critical challenge for river managers is understanding the consequences of these uncertainties in the data for prioritisation and decision-making regarding barrier removal or mitigation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Mammal declines across northern Australia are one of the major biodiversity loss events occurring globally. There has been no regional assessment of the implications of these species declines for genomic diversity. To address this, we conducted a species-wide assessment of genomic diversity in the northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus), an Endangered marsupial carnivore. We used next generation sequencing methods to genotype 10,191 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 352 individuals from across a 3220-km length of the continent, investigating patterns of population genomic structure and diversity, and identifying loci showing signals of putative selection. We found strong heterogeneity in the distribution of genomic diversity across the continent, characterized by (i) biogeographical barriers driving hierarchical population structure through long-term isolation, and (ii) severe reductions in diversity resulting from population declines, exacerbated by the spread of introduced toxic cane toads (Rhinella marina). These results warn of a large ongoing loss of genomic diversity and associated adaptive capacity as mammals decline across northern Australia. Encouragingly, populations of the northern quoll established on toad-free islands by translocations appear to have maintained most of the initial genomic diversity after 16 years. By mapping patterns of genomic diversity within and among populations, and investigating these patterns in the context of population declines, we can provide conservation managers with data critical to informed decision-making. This includes the identification of populations that are candidates for genetic management, the importance of remnant island and insurance/translocated populations for the conservation of genetic diversity, and the characterization of putative evolutionarily significant units. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Bats play crucial ecological roles and provide valuable ecosystem services, yet many populations face serious threats from various ecological disturbances. The North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) aims to use its technology infrastructure to assess status and trends of bat populations, while developing innovative and community-driven conservation solutions. Here, we present NABat ML, an automated machine-learning algorithm that improves the scalability and scientific transparency of NABat acoustic monitoring. This model combines signal processing techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and classify recorded bat echolocation calls. We developed our CNN model with internet-based computing resources (‘cloud environment’), and trained it on >600,000 spectrogram images. We also incorporated species range maps to improve the robustness and accuracy of the model for future ‘unseen’ data. We evaluated model performance using a comprehensive, independent, holdout dataset. NABat ML successfully distinguished 31 classes (30 species and a noise class) with overall weighted-average accuracy and precision rates of 92%, and ≥90% classification accuracy for 19 of the bat species. Using a single cloud-environment computing instance, the entire model training process took <16 h. Synthesis and applications. Our convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model, NABat ML, classifies 30 North American bat species using their recorded echolocation calls with an overall accuracy of 92%. In addition to providing highly accurate species-level classification, NABat ML and its outputs are compatible with Bayesian and other statistical techniques for measuring uncertainty in classification. Our model is open-source and reproducible, enabling future implementations as software on end-user devices and cloud-based web applications. These qualities make NABat ML highly suitable for applications ranging from grassroots community science initiatives to big-data methods developed and implemented by researchers and professional practitioners. We believe the transparency and accessibility of NABat ML will encourage broad-scale participation in bat monitoring, and enable development of innovative solutions needed to conserve North American bat species. © 2022 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada and The Authors.

abstract={Aim: Conservation efforts have traditionally addressed the threat of biodiversity loss by prioritizing regions and habitats with high endemic species richness. However, species-poor habitats often harbour distinct, valuable and/or functionally unique species that contribute to regional diversity. In the tropical marine realm, the ‘mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum’ has dominated both the scientific literature and marine spatial planning. Bare sediment habitats are also part of this continuum and often comprise the majority of bottom area, as they do in most regions worldwide, but are understudied and rarely considered in conservation. To address this information gap, we partition the relative contributions of five habitats in the coastal mosaic (forereefs, patch reefs, seagrass, mangroves and bare sand) to fish diversity across a tropical seascape. Location: Carrie Bow Cay, Belize Barrier Reef. Methods: Using diver visual censuses, we assessed fish community composition at three replicate sites from each of the five habitats annually for 5 years. We then partitioned diversity into within (α) and between (β) habitat contributions, and further partitioned β-diversity into components attributed to species replacement and richness difference. Finally, we determined the local contributions to β-diversity (LCBD) by each habitat and identified the key individual species behind these contributions. Main Results: Tropical sand flats contributed uniquely and disproportionately to regional fish species diversity, despite having the fewest species overall. Sand flats also had higher-than-expected local contributions to β-diversity (LCBD) and had the highest percentage of species not found in other habitats. Main Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that previously understudied sand habitats harbour a relatively unique assemblage of species compared with other nearby habitats. Marine spatial planning aimed at maximizing the preservation of total biodiversity (including unique species) in the tropics should consider sand habitats. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Biologically diverse forest and woodland restoration can mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss. Understanding the trade-off between carbon storage and biodiversity is important to maximise the value of restoration opportunities. Ecological theory suggests biological diversity contributes positively to carbon storage until the relationship plateaus (i.e., species are added with no effect on carbon storage), and yet in practice, tree monocultures are perceived to sequester more carbon than diverse plantings. Here, we measured the contribution of plant diversity to carbon storage in trees and shrubs ten years after planting for yate (Eucalyptus occidentalis) woodland restoration. We found no evidence for a trade-off between carbon storage and plant diversity. We planted yate with mixes of yate woodland species including native grasses, shrubs, and trees. Ten years after planting, grass establishment was poor, and density of trees and shrubs was patchy. There was some unassisted recruitment of woody species. Diversity was measured as observed species richness and observed functional richness, which incorporated taxonomic diversity, structural diversity, and presence/absence of nitrogen-fixing legumes. Carbon stocks measured were above and belowground tree and shrub biomass, leaf and twig litter biomass, and organic carbon (%) in the topsoil. Across all three carbon stocks diverse yate plantings sequestered as much carbon as yate monocultures. Observed species richness had a weak negative effect on tree and shrub biomass in the best linear mixed model but this effect diminished with the removal of an outlier. Tree density had a positive effect on tree and shrub biomass in models with and without the outlier. There was no effect of diversity on litter biomass and soil organic carbon. Instead, linear mixed models of these stocks showed the influence of soil properties. Litter biomass increased with soil potassium and decreased with soil pH. Soil organic carbon increased with initial soil organic carbon and soil nitrogen. There are potential additional biodiversity benefits of diverse plantings that we did not measure (e.g., soil erosion control, wildlife habitat). We call for more field experiments to explore these potential benefits and to generate the ecological knowledge needed to improve the quality of global forest and woodland restoration efforts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Alien invasive plant species are one of the main drivers of global biodiversity loss. Methods for monitoring the spread of alien invasive plants are needed to improve management and mitigate impact on local biodiversity. Recent advances in deep learning and image fusion holds great potential for mapping and managing alien invasive plants. One such method is super-resolution image reconstruction, where a neural network learns to downscale images from coarse to fine resolution. Within the commercial timber production landscape of KwaZulu-Natal, endangered grassland corridors are threatened by American bramble invasion, impacting plants, birds, arthropods, and soil restoration. Here we aim to improve our understanding of bramble invasion dynamics through using super-resolved satellite mosaics. Bramble was classified with very high accuracies (85%) from the super-resolved satellite mosaic, compared to other conventional satellite imagery with different spectral and spatial resolutions. Using landscape analyses, we identified plantation tree harvesting and prescribed burning to be major drivers increasing bramble cover within the landscape. Bramble cover was highest one year following plantation tree harvesting. Continuous prescribed burning positively influenced bramble. Bramble cover was also high close to streams, and under future invasion projections, bramble will severely impact Ensifera species alongside low priority grasshopper species habitat. Results also indicate that bramble has a significant negative impact on intermediate priority grasshoppers and plant species richness. For controlling bramble invasion within commercial timber production landscapes, we recommend the adoption rotational harvesting, as harvesting entire plantation blocks throughout the landscape will dramatically increase invasion potential of bramble. Current bramble removal programmes should prioritize riparian areas. Special attention is needed to control bramble one year after timber harvesting, as this is when bramble cover is highest. We show the benefits of using super-resolved mosaics to gain new insights into alien invasive species dynamics, while further development of this technique will aid in managing invasive alien plant species at local scales. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Global biodiversity loss and mass extinction of species are two of the most critical environmental issues the world is currently facing, resulting in the disruption of various ecosystems central to environmental functions and human health. Microbiome-targeted interventions, such as probiotics and microbiome transplants, are emerging as potential options to reverse deterioration of biodiversity and increase the resilience of wildlife and ecosystems. However, the implementation of these interventions is urgently needed. We summarize the current concepts, bottlenecks and ethical aspects encompassing the careful and responsible management of ecosystem resources using the microbiome (termed microbiome stewardship) to rehabilitate organisms and ecosystem functions. We propose a real-world application framework to guide environmental and wildlife probiotic applications. This framework details steps that must be taken in the upscaling process while weighing risks against the high toll of inaction. In doing so, we draw parallels with other aspects of contemporary science moving swiftly in the face of urgent global challenges. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={The ongoing climate crisis is a significant threat to global biodiversity. As Earth warms, many species respond by shifting their geographical ranges either polewards, or in mountainous regions, upslope towards higher elevations, presumably to track suitable thermal environments. Upslope range shifts are of particular concern in tropical mountain ranges because: (a) tropical species are particularly thermally sensitive; (b) species moving upwards could become locally extirpated as they run out of habitable space; and (c) tropical mountains harbor a high fraction of Earth's terrestrial biodiversity. Rapid upslope shifts can, therefore, result in significant biodiversity losses. We used community science data over a 13-year period to evaluate whether 93 Eastern Himalayan bird species might be shifting to higher elevations. To do this, we analyzed changes in their occurrence probabilities in eBird checklists from birdwatching hotspots at fixed elevations. We found patterns consistent with upslope range shifts; species with elevational ranges primarily below hotspot elevations show increases in their occurrence probability over time, and those with most of their elevational ranges above a hotspot elevation decline in occurrence probability. Our findings are suggestive of rapid responses to climate change by Eastern Himalayan birds. We caution that Eastern Himalayan bird species might be at special risk from increasing global temperatures because of heightened thermal sensitivity coupled with high rates of warming in the region. To remain resilient in the face of climate change, Eastern Himalayan birds likely require undisturbed habitats spanning entire elevational gradients, to track rising temperatures by moving to higher elevations. © 2022 Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract={Mountain woodland ecotones require urgent action to reverse long-term habitat degradation and biodiversity loss. There is growing interest in restoring high-elevation woodland and scrub communities by harnessing planting and natural regeneration. Emissions offsetting has been a key driver, yet mountain systems offer slower mechanisms for biomass accumulation due to their typically smaller size, lower density, and slower growth than forests at lower elevations. We argue that the natural capital afforded by mountain woodland restoration is far more comprehensive than carbon sequestration alone and encompasses an important array of ecosystem services and biodiversity gains. Improved opportunities for wildlife and people include natural hazard protection, sheltering, structural variability, vegetation diversity, and recreation. Furthermore, mountain woodland restoration provides critically needed nature-based solutions for reducing threats from escalating climate change such as soil erosion, flooding, warming temperatures, and extreme weather. It is imperative that these benefits are embedded within conservation policy and environmental incentives. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Large-scale rewilding has been proposed as an effective method to combat the global biodiversity crisis, although there is a lack of data to support this. Rewilding generally refers to a process that allows nature to recover by reducing human interference, without the predefined end-goal that more traditional restoration projects usually have. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) is perhaps the most famous example of passive rewilding (rewilding with little or no management), but until now, most research has focused on the impact of radiation on wildlife rather than on rewilding. Here, we analyze species composition change of raptors in the Belarusian CEZ over a 22-year period, starting 12 years after the accident, alongside national raptor monitoring data. Generalist and farmland-associated mesopredators, super-abundant at the beginning of our study, strongly declined, as open habitats (former agricultural land) rewetted or became overgrown. Increase in waterlogged areas saw wetland specialists increase in abundance, including two species locally extinct from the area before the accident: Greater Spotted Eagle (Endangered in Europe) and White-tailed Eagle. Greater Spotted Eagles are an indicator of wetland habitat quality, and while declining throughout Europe in recent decades, they have increased from zero to at least 13 pairs, over the whole Belarusian CEZ. Our research is evidence that rewilding could be an effective way of restoring species and species interactions found in near-natural habitats, and if human interferences in ecological processes are reduced, a priori restoration goals and continued management are not always necessary to conserve threatened species. © 2022 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract={With the population increasing, fish communities, as important components in the river system, were inescapably impacted by human activities. To investigate these impacts, we characterized the fish community's composition by environmental DNA metabarcoding in the urban and suburban sites along Xiang River in central China. The results showed that 32 species were identified, and most species were from Cypriniform. The analysis indicated no significant differences in fish communities among the three urban areas. However, significant differences were observed between the bank solidified and non-solidified areas, which indicated that the channelization significantly influenced the biodiversity and abundances. An alien species, Clarias gariepinus, was discovered in all examined sites, and it was negatively associated with ten native species. Furthermore, human populations and acidification were also negatively related to diversity. Our findings clearly showed that the consequences of anthropogenic activities shaped ichthyofauna and caused biodiversity loss in the urban river. © 2021 Shanghai Ocean University.},

abstract={Common and rare species differ in their level of dispersal ability and habitat specialization, and thus should respond to distinct assembly rules. Rare species are much more spatially restricted and usually show higher habitat specialization, so they can be much more vulnerable to landscape changes than common species. We simulated three species-loss scenarios to assess how different groups of stream fish species respond to environmental and spatial variables and how potential extinctions affected regional functional richness and the average functional distinctiveness. Rare and common species contribute similarly to the global functional richness, but the loss of common species led to a marked decrease in local redundancy. Whilst intermediate and rare species are regulated by dispersal, dominant species respond to niche processes and are more affected by land-use changes. Therefore, common and rare species are under distinct assembly rules and may exhibit distinct responses in the face of environmental anthropization. Addressing rare species is often overlooked, despite constant claims regarding their importance and their frequently concerning conservation status. Accounting for their rarity can offer a more refined look at the responses of species to human modifications, providing valuable information on how to tackle biodiversity loss. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={After the worst mine-tailing dam disaster which occurred in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, it was necessary to understand the extent of the biodiversity loss. Thus, based on legal obligations, a monitoring of the fauna and flora along the Rio Doce basin was developed. From this large study, surprisingly, two undescribed psammophilous mayfly species were collected. Given the environmental disaster, and the particular concern with species that inhabiting sandy bottom, the two new species may be already threatened. Considering the reported circumstances, our objective is to described the new species and carry out their extinction risk assessment following the IUCN protocol. Apobaetis irai sp. nov. can be distinguished by the size and shape of the setae in the distal middle area of the dorsal surface of the labrum, with 3 minutes, blunt spatulate setae and the shape of the labial palp; is likely to be threated, plausibly eligible, at least, as Vulnerable (VU) B2ab(iii)+D2. Rivudiva watu sp. nov., can be distinguished by the distal shape of glossae, absence of row of setae on ventral margin on the hind tibiae and hypopharynx without distomedial projection; given its distribution, it was not directly impacted by the disaster, however, there is not enough data to accurately estimate the extent of its occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), therefore, it may be eligible for Data Deficient (DD).

abstract={Success stories are rare in conservation science, hindered also by the research-implementation gap, where scientific insights rarely inform practice and practical implementation is rarely evaluated scientifically. Amphibian population declines, driven by multiple stressors, are emblematic of the freshwater biodiversity crisis. Habitat creation is a straightforward conservation action that has been shown to locally benefit amphibians, as well as other taxa, but does it benefit entire amphibian communities at large spatial scales? Here, we evaluate a landscape-scale pond-construction program by fitting dynamic occupancy models to 20 y of monitoring data for 12 pond-breeding amphibian species in the Swiss state Aargau, a densely populated area of the Swiss lowlands with intensive land use. After decades of population declines, the number of occupied ponds increased statewide for 10 out of 12 species, while one species remained stable and one species further declined between 1999 and 2019. Despite regional differences, in 77% of all 43 regional metapopulations, the colonization and subsequent occupation of new ponds stabilized (14%) or increased (63%) metapopulation size. Likely mechanisms include increased habitat availability, restoration of habitat dynamics, and increased connectivity between ponds. Colonization probabilities reflected species-specific preferences for characteristics of ponds and their surroundings, which provides evidence-based information for future pond construction targeting specific species. The relatively simple but landscape-scale and persistent conservation action of constructing hundreds of new ponds halted declines and stabilized or increased the state-wide population size of all but one species, despite ongoing pressures from other stressors in a human-dominated landscape.

abstract={Deforestation and forest degradation are among the main biodiversity loss drivers worldwide. The expansion of productive activities, such as forest plantations, often results in the loss and degradation of native forests, affecting native species in many ways. While many studies have assessed the effects of habitat degradation on taxonomic diversity, the effects on functional diversity have been little explored. Functional diversity provides a robust framework for understanding how anthropogenic disturbance changes biodiversity. We assessed how bird functional diversity changes along a habitat degradation gradient in the Valdivian rainforests (southern Chile). We used four functional diversity indices and compared four habitat types (old-growth, secondary, and logged native forests and exotic plantations) to assess how functional diversity changes depending on habitat structure and bird life history, and behavioral traits. We found that most functional diversity differences occur between old growth and secondary native forests, being the latter the less functionally diverse habitat. Further, secondary forests lack natural tree cavities, and birds nesting there are more prone to be affected by brood parasitism. Changes in habitat structure seem to be determinant for bird functional diversity along a habitat degradation gradient. Therefore, habitat degradation can lead to functional homogenization beyond changes in species richness or abundance, with less evident ecological consequences. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Deep-sea communities are impacted by several anthropogenic activities, such as fisheries, which still remain one of the most damaging on the marine environments in terms of biodiversity loss and habitat degradation. The north-western Ionian Sea (Central Mediterranean) experienced long-standing trawl fishing activity with the exploitation of deep-sea demersal resources. The integrate analysis with data of both benthic, demersal and benthopelagic species collected during a time series of experimental trawl survey, yearly carried out in the Ionian basin down to 800 m in depth, allowed to asses the current status of the Ionian deep-sea faunal assemblages and their potential changes overtime. Multivariate analysis and univariate indices, modelled using Generalized Additive Model (GAM) framework, confirm a depth zonation pattern of deep-sea faunal assemblages in the study area, with the presence of two distinct epibathyal and mesobathyal groups. GAM also highlighted a temporal effect on the biodiversity indices, with significant negative trends of diversity and evenness indices as well as a significant increasing of dominance one, over the study period 2012-2020. The benthic community is characterised by more generalist species and a simplified structure, with a severe depletion in habitat-former taxa whereas the demersal and benthopelagic fauna of the Ionian Sea show a general stability in the overall structure if compared with previous studies lasting over two decades. The presence of complex and heterogenous habitats unsuitable for trawl, like cold-water coral communities and canyon systems, provide Essential Fish Habitats (EFHs) for commercial species, acting as potential renewal areas for exploited resources in the neighbouring fishing grounds. These findings encourage an ecosystem-based management including spatial considerations for the objectives of biodiversity conservation combined with those of management of fishery resources.

abstract={Human-induced environmental impacts on wildlife are widespread, causing major biodiversity losses. One major threat is agricultural intensification, typically characterised by large areas of monoculture, mechanical tillage, and the use of agrochemicals. Intensification leads to the fragmentation and loss of natural habitats, native vegetation, and nesting and breeding sites. Understanding the adaptability of insects to these changing environmental conditions is critical to predicting their survival. Bumblebees, key pollinators of wild and cultivated plants, are used as model species to assess insect adaptation to anthropogenic stressors. We investigated the effects of agricultural pressures on two common European bumblebees, Bombus pascuorum and B. lapidarius. Restriction-site Associated DNA Sequencing was used to identify loci under selective pressure across agricultural-natural gradients over 97 locations in Europe. 191 unique loci in B. pascuorum and 260 in B. lapidarius were identified as under selective pressure, and associated with agricultural stressors. Further investigation suggested several candidate proteins including several neurodevelopment, muscle, and detoxification proteins, but these have yet to be validated. These results provide insights into agriculture as a stressor for bumblebees, and signal for conservation action in light of ongoing anthropogenic changes.

abstract={In light of global biodiversity loss, there is an increasing need for large-scale wildlife monitoring. This is difficult for mammals, since they can be elusive and nocturnal. In the United Kingdom, there is a lack of systematic, widespread mammal monitoring, and a recognized deficiency of data. Innovative new approaches are required. We developed MammalWeb, a portal to enable UK-wide camera trapping by a network of citizen scientists and partner organizations. MammalWeb citizen scientists contribute to both the collection and classification of camera trap data. Following trials in 2013–2017, MammalWeb has grown organically to increase its geographic reach (e.g. ∼2000 sites in Britain). It has so far provided the equivalent of over 340 camera trap-years of wild mammal monitoring, and produced nearly 440,000 classified image sequences and videos, of which, over 180,000 are mammal detections. We describe MammalWeb, its background, its development and the novel approaches we have for participation. We consider the data collected by MammalWeb participants, especially in light of their relevance to the main goals of wildlife monitoring: to provide spatial data, abundance data and temporal behavioural data. MammalWeb can complement existing approaches to mammal monitoring. Explicit accounting for spatial and temporal patterns in animal activity enables accounting of bias relative to ad hoc observational data. Estimating abundance presents challenges, as for many camera-trapping studies, but we discuss the potential of the data as they stand, and opportunities to advance their value for abundance estimation. Challenges remain to MammalWeb's central missions of enhancing engagement with and connection to nature, and delivering policy-relevant data on Britain's wild mammals. We discuss these challenges and the opportunities they provide for advances in respect of engagement, science and financial security. Our approach reduces administrative burden and increases spatial coverage and, as such, MammalWeb provides a useful addition to existing case studies of citizen science camera-trapping program design. We believe MammalWeb is an important step towards fulfilling calls for UK-wide mammal monitoring and our description of challenges identifies an agenda for fulfilling that purpose. © 2022 The Authors.

funding_text 1={The annual operational budget of a citizen science project can be, in one example, over USD 110,000 (Fauver, 2016). MammalWeb has deliberately remained small to ensure affordability but, even so, the fixed annual costs for servers, data storage and platform maintenance are in the order of USD 6000. The cost of platform improvements is higher still, and we do not currently account for the time volunteered to the project by scientists and policymakers. We have been fortunate in attracting sufficient numbers of small, directed project grants to be able to meet our annual costs, hitherto. However, the funding landscape is inherently unstable, and long-term security will only be achieved through a sustainable financial model. It is possible to conjecture several models for sustainable financing of citizen science projects, which are worth exploring. A common approach among NGOs is a membership model, in which participants contribute an annual sum to support the work of an organization. Among environmental NGOs, this is most common for those that take direct action or manage landscapes for wildlife protection. The British Trust for Ornithology presents an example of a membership-funded organization whose main focus is ‘understanding birds and, in particular, how and why bird populations are changing’ (BTO, 2010) and they run several monitoring schemes in which members pay for participation, suggesting that this is not necessarily a deterrent to engagement. However, this might be problematic for the wider participation that our platform is designed to foster. Alternatively, the eMammal platform charges camera trapping projects—instead of citizen scientists—for hosting their data (https://emammal.si.edu/about/costs/); doing so for larger collaborating organizations could be a viable way to fund the platform without deterring wider participation. A second possibility to defray the fixed costs of the project would be to partner with an organization that already hosts online platforms and specializes in engagement. To such organizations, the cost of hosting MammalWeb would likely make less difference to their running costs than might be expected based on our current running costs. To date, our exploration of this possibility with two organizations have revealed technological limitations or compatibility issues that require upfront investment. Nonetheless, both avenues merit further investigation. A third possibility is associated with sponsorship. MammalWeb is an online facility with the potential to reach large numbers of individuals with quite defined interests. This could be of interest to a commercial sponsor or advertising by relevant retailers. Finally, the United Kingdom is obliged by the Bern Convention and associated UK statutes to ensure the conservation of wild plant and animal species, and by the Convention of Biological Diversity to provide biodiversity indicators as agreed from time to time. These can only be demonstrated with some degree of wildlife monitoring. Efficient tools to support that requirement are likely to be important but it remains to be seen whether core funding will be allocated for that purpose.

abstract={Biodiversity in ecosystems plays an important role in supporting human welfare, including regulating the transmission of infectious diseases. Many of these services are not fully-appreciated due to complex environmental dynamics and lack of baseline data. Multicontinental amphibian decline due to the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) provides a stark example. Even though amphibians are known to affect natural food webs—including mosquitoes that transmit human diseases—the human health impacts connected to their massive decline have received little attention. Here we leverage a unique ensemble of ecological surveys, satellite data, and newly digitized public health records to show an empirical link between a wave of Bd-driven collapse of amphibians in Costa Rica and Panama and increased human malaria incidence. Subsequent to the estimated date of Bd-driven amphibian decline in each ‘county’ (canton or distrito), we find that malaria cases are significantly elevated for several years. For the six year peak of the estimated effect, the annual expected county-level increase in malaria ranges from 0.76 to 1.1 additional cases per 1000 population. This is a substantial increase given that cases country-wide per 1000 population peaked during the timeframe of our study at approximately 1.5 for Costa Rica and 1.1 for Panama. This previously unidentified impact of biodiversity loss illustrates the often hidden human welfare costs of conservation failures. These findings also show the importance of mitigating international trade-driven spread of similar emergent pathogens like Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans. © 2022 The Author(s).

abstract={Local declines of wild populations represent the most visible part of biodiversity loss, and their detection often relies on long-term surveys. An alternative to identify risk-prone populations is to use indicators informing on their general health (i.e., their general fitness and ability to cope with changing environment) based on simple and complementary parameters estimated from snapshot sampling. However, most studies on wildlife population health focus on one or only a few parameters, yielding potentially biased conclusions for conservation. Here, we developed a multifaceted index of population health by combining 3 complementary indicators, namely pathological, ecological, and genetic indicators, based on an integrative approach traditionally used to assess ecosystem multifunctionality. We investigated their complementarity and relevance for detecting brown trout (Salmo trutta) risk-prone populations at a large spatial scale, and the underlying environmental stressors. The multifaceted health index properly represented the individual indicators' complementary information. It identified a cluster of moderately risk-prone populations and raised the alarm for one population. Each indicator was individually associated with distinct environmental stressors relevant for brown trout requirements. The multifaceted health index highlighted surrounding agricultural land and oxygen concentration as the most impacting environmental factors for the general health and sustainability of brown trout populations. The implementation of such integrative index can be transferred to a wide range of species and contexts. This index therefore provides to environmental managers and conservationists a snapshot and easily operated tool to identify risk-prone populations and areas to restore or conserve. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Litter decomposition is a fundamental ecosystem service that can be affected by the nonadditive effect of litter mixing. We hypothesize that drought will slow the decomposition of litter mixtures due to a decline in complementary resource use. The presence of soil fauna could favor litter decomposition and mitigate the drought effect, but this depends on soil nitrogen (N) availability to soil fauna. To test these hypotheses, we compared the decomposition of single and all possible litter mixtures (11) of four leaf litter types in litterbags with three mesh sizes (i.e., 0.05-mm, 1-mm, and 5-mm) in control and treatment plots (drought, N addition or both) in an N-enriched bamboo forest ecosystem. Increasing the litter species richness moderately accelerated litter carbon (C) and N loss. The positive effect of litter diversity on decomposition was due to more complementary resource use. Both drought and N addition slowed the C and N loss from diverse litter mixtures, and N addition exacerbated the negative drought effect in this N-enriched forest. These negative effects of abiotic manipulation on litter decomposition were partly attributed to less complementary resource use. Specifically, the complementarity effects of litter mixing on C loss declined significantly, by 50%, with drought, and was even more pronounced in the drought and N addition treantment. The three-way interactions among drought, N addition, and decomposer communities demonstrated that the presence of soil fauna supports complementary resource use and alleviates thedrought constraint, but not the restriction in decomposition caused by N addition in this N-enriched forest. These findings have implications for projected decomposition rates under future global change scenarios, since they suggest that environmental changes affect decomposition through direct effects on soil biota and indirect impacts on within- and among-trophic interactions in forest ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The conversion of natural habitats into anthropogenic uses is a key driver of global biodiversity loss, but effects can vary among taxa and diversity metrics. This has important implications for the use of bioindicators in land management. We evaluated the local-scale responses of multiple faunal taxa to land-use change in the Brazilian Cerrado measuring different aspects (taxonomic and functional) and levels (alpha and beta) of diversity. We compared ant, dung beetle and bird assemblages inhabiting remnants of natural habitat (savanna and semi-deciduous forest) with those found in cattle pastures, soy fields or Eucalyptus plantations. Species richness was markedly higher in natural habitats for ants and birds but not for dung beetles. Effects on functional alpha diversity were taxon specific and there was not such a contrast between natural and anthropogenic habitats. Patterns of functional beta diversity were correlated with patterns of taxonomic beta diversity and were also taxon specific. For dung beetles, site-to-site variation in taxonomic and functional composition was greatest in forests, whereas birds tended to present greater spatial turnover and ants greater nestedeness in the anthropogenic than in the natural habitats. Among the three anthropogenic land uses, tree plantations presented the most similar composition to natural habitat for all taxa. Overall, similarity in taxonomic and functional composition between natural and anthropogenic habitats was greater for savanna than forest. Synthesis and applications. The responses of ant, dung beetle and bird assemblages to land-use change in the Cerrado were highly variable. Nonetheless, results indicate that the extent of impacts on biodiversity reflects the extent of habitat transformation and that impacts at a landscape scale may be reduced by a mix of land uses. We showed that effects were more severe from a taxonomic than from a functional perspective, for the forest than for the savanna-associated fauna, for the ant and bird than for the dung beetle fauna, and often in lands devoted to intensive agriculture rather than to pastoralism or plantation forestry. Our findings can help guide the selection and assessment of indicator taxa and the interpretation of exactly what they are indicating. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Rampant deforestation has caused the loss and fragmentation of natural habitats, which has precipitated a global biodiversity crisis. Research on how land-use change contributes to a loss of biodiversity is urgently needed, especially in ecosystems that have undergone rapid anthropogenic changes. We sought to investigate the extent to which habitat loss, fragmentation, and habitat split (the separation of forest and aquatic habitats) negatively influenced taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, total abundance, and the individual abundances of five anuran species in the Brazilian Cerrado. We sampled anurans between December 2017 and March 2018 using pitfall traps at sites distributed along a gradient of habitat fragmentation/habitat split: unfragmented forest, forest fragments without habitat split, and forest fragments with habitat split. Forest cover was measured within a 1-km radius of each site. Sites within unfragmented forests had higher taxonomic and functional diversities than either fragment type. Taxonomic diversity was highly correlated with functional diversity, but we did not find a pattern to the loss of functional traits. Total anuran abundance and the abundances of Chiasmocleis albopunctata, Physalaemus cuvieri, and Rhinella diptycha were higher in unfragmented forests compared to forest fragments. No species was more abundant in fragments than in unfragmented forests. Our results indicate that the fragmentation of forests by agricultural land use is directly and indirectly responsible for the loss of taxonomic and functional diversity, as well as for reducing population sizes of ground-dwelling anurans. Although we did not find a distinct effect of habitat split on ground-dwelling anurans, our study underscores the importance of preserving continuous forest habitats for the maintenance of anuran diversity in the Cerrado. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Aim: Climate change is an increasingly important driver of biodiversity loss. The ectothermic nature of amphibians may make them particularly sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation regimes, adding to declines from other threats. While active season environmental conditions can influence growth and survival, effects of variation in winter conditions on population dynamics are less well-studied. Given that extreme winter temperatures can influence amphibian survival and fitness, we expected that increased winter severity—as measured by variability in winter temperatures and snow cover—would be associated with decreased occupancy, and that populations that experience more severe winters would have the largest sensitivities and show the greatest declines. Location: Eastern United States. Time period: 2001–2015. Major taxa studied: Anurans. Methods: We used large-scale citizen science data from the eastern half of the United States, a diverse biogeographic and climatic region, to assess how variation in winter severity influenced occupancy dynamics (i.e. presence or absence of species across sites and years) of 11 spring and summer breeding anuran species. Results: Most species had increased occupancy in years with greater than average snow cover and warmer than average mean winter temperatures. Surprisingly, climatic conditions in winter affected occupancy dynamics of species with varying life history characteristics, including both spring and summer breeding species, those that overwinter under the soil, and those that overwinter in ponds and stream beds. For two wide-ranging species (Lithobates catesbeianus and Lithobates clamitans), colder winter temperatures reduced occupancy more at northern latitudes, while the association between days of snow cover and latitude was equivocal. Main conclusions: As the climate continues to change, expected reductions in snowpack may reduce occupancy of already declining anuran populations, while milder winters may improve overwinter survival for some species. The contradictory impacts of temperature and snow cover illustrate the importance of considering multi-dimensional impacts of climate change on anuran populations. Published 2022.

abstract={Non-native plants are a major cause of habitat loss and fragmentation that lead to biodiversity loss. Geckos are particularly vulnerable to habitat alterations due to their small range and their restricted and specific terrestrial habits. However, our understanding of how introduced plants affect geckos, is poor. In this study, we investigate the potential effects of non-native and invasive neo-tropical tree Cedrela odorata on the critically endangered electric blue gecko, Lygodactylus williamsi, and its sole habitat, Pandanus rabaiensis. We used 107 square (10 m x 10 m) sample plots distributed systematically throughout the forest to assess the extent and effects of C. odorata on P. rabaiensis forest patches. We compared the abundance of L. williamsi on 125 P. rabaiensis trees growing in a mixture with C. odorata, native trees, and in pure stands and at three canopy cover categories (0–30%, >30–50%, and > 50%). We found an inverse relationship between the abundance of C. odorata trees (diameter at breast height (DBH)> 10 cm) and the abundance of P. rabaiensis. Spatially, the two trees dominated different parts of the forest. In contrast, the abundance of L. williamsi was not significantly affected by the presence of C. odorata. However, change in the canopy cover of the trees growing above the P. rabaiensis significantly affected the abundance of L. williamsi. The abundance of L. williamsi in a 0–30% cover was significantly higher than 30–50% and > 50% canopy covers. The findings of this study suggest that if left unmanaged, C. odorata could continue to take up the space that could be occupied by P. rabaiensis and other native plants, and thus limit the population size of an endangered species. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={With the ongoing global biodiversity crisis in the Anthropocene, it is critical to understand how to save endangered species to “bend the curve” of biodiversity decline. The Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus) is a Critically Endangered species that is endemic to Hainan Island. We performed two synchronized total count surveys in Hainan Tropic Rain Forest National Park in November and December of 2020 and 2021 by locating gibbon groups from their morning calls and conducting detailed counts in all potential habitat fragments. We compared our findings with existing data to model the population trend, and analyzed the potential and realized reproductive potentials. We found 5 groups with a total of 33 gibbons in 2020 and 35 in 2021, including 4 and 6 solitary individuals respectively. This is an increase of 169% since 2003, when there were 13 individuals with 2 groups and 2 solitary individuals. Logistic and linear curves fitted the 2003-2021 population census data equally well. Although the population is growing, it has not realized its full reproductive potential (when all adult females give births at 24-month intervals), suggesting that external factors like available habitat, as well as nutritional, physiological, and behavioral factors may be limiting the population. The gibbon’s recovery demonstrates that establishing a nature reserve with regular patrols, banning logging, curbing poaching, and environmental education have been effective. Because the Hainan gibbon population is still extremely small, carefully planned conservation actions, including an ambitious forest restoration program, will be needed to ensure the species’ continued survival. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Reintroduction has often been used as a technique for re-establishing self-sustaining animal populations that have become extinct within their indigenous range. To achieve conservation success, it is essential to accurately assess the demographic parameters and the IUCN Red List criteria of the population. However, acquiring data on all indicators and estimating criteria according to established definitions can be challenging. Here, we developed an integrated population model (IPM) and population viability analysis (PVA) framework to estimate all demographic parameters and criteria for a reintroduced population of Crested Ibis Nipponia nippon, and to project population dynamics under a range of release scenarios on Sado Island, Japan. Our IPM-PVA framework integrated roost count and mark–resight data for 415 released and 203 wild-hatched individuals, as well as reproductive performance for a total of 575 pairs. We aimed to assess survival, reproductive success, population size, number of mature individuals and population projection. In the first year after release, the estimated apparent annual survival rate was 0.566 [Bayesian credible intervals (CRI) 0.518–0.614]; however, this rate increased after 1 year (0.865; CRI 0.836–0.892). Wild-hatched juveniles exhibited a high survival rate (0.757; CRI 0.670–0.838) that was just lower than that of adults (0.899; CRI 0.844–0.949). The reproductive success rate varied with pair attributes (released–released pair: 0.245, CRI 0.194–0.299; released–wild pair: 0.377, CRI 0.281–0.471; wild–wild pair: 0.350, CRI 0.237–0.471). Total population size was estimated to be 457 individuals (CRI 384–525), with 261 mature individuals (CRI 211–304) in June 2021. The probability of Crested Ibis extinction in the next five generations was 0%, even if the release was discontinued. Our comprehensive case study demonstrated the effectiveness of IPM-PVA for the evaluation of ongoing reintroduction programmes. © 2022 British Ornithologists' Union.},

abstract={Climate change can be expected to alter ecosystems and influence the spatial distribution of species. Understanding the effects of climate change on species distribution can help develop effective conservation protocols to tackle further biodiversity loss. Striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) global populations appear to follow an overall decreasing trend as the species faces numerous threats. Hyena presence location data was collected, and we utilized a Maxent species distribution model to predict current and future distribution patterns in Nepal. We used two distinct representative concentration pathway (RCP) values (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) to determine potential impacts on hyena distribution. We found that hyena current suitable habitat in Nepal extends over 22,000 km2 and is projected to significantly decrease in both (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) scenarios. In terms of habitat reduction, we further showed that RCP 8.5 was more adverse than RCP 4.5. We found that the Chure hills and the Terai regions hold the largest extent of hyena habitat in Nepal. Hyena habitat reduction was comparatively lower within the protected areas. Future projections, however, portend severe consequences for the species’ survival as suitable habitat areas will be drastically reduced in the next 50 years. Further research on hyena microhabitat suitability under anthropogenic and topographic variables will be useful for future conservation policies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Mammal Research Institute Polish Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={The conservation status of large-bodied mammals is dire. Their decline has serious consequences because they have unique ecological roles not replicated by smaller-bodied animals. Here, we use the fossil record of the megafauna extinction at the terminal Pleistocene to explore the consequences of past biodiversity loss. We characterize the isotopic and body-size niche of a mammal community in Texas before and after the event to assess the influence on the ecology and ecological interactions of surviving species (>1 kg). Preextinction, a variety of C4 grazers, C3 browsers, and mixed feeders existed, similar to modern African savannas, with likely specialization among the two sabertooth species for juvenile grazers. Postextinction, body size and isotopic niche space were lost, and the δ13C and δ15N values of some survivors shifted. We see mesocarnivore release within the Felidae: the jaguar, now an apex carnivore, moved into the specialized isotopic niche previously occupied by extinct cats. Puma, previously absent, became common and lynx shifted toward consuming more C4-based resources. Lagomorphs were the only herbivores to shift toward C4 resources. Body size changes from the Pleistocene to Holocene were species-specific, with some animals (deer, hare) becoming significantly larger and others smaller (bison, rabbits) or exhibiting no change to climate shifts or biodiversity loss. Overall, the Holocene body-size-isotopic niche was drastically reduced and considerable ecological complexity lost. We conclude biodiversity loss led to reorganization of survivors and many "missing pieces"within our community; without intervention, the loss of Earth's remaining ecosystems that support megafauna will likely suffer the same fate. © 2022 the Author(s).},

abstract={Due to climate change and habitat conversion, estimates of the resulting levels of species extinction over the next century are alarming. Devising conservation solutions will require many different approaches, including examining the extinction processes of recently extinct species. Given that parrots are one of the most threatened groups of birds, information regarding parrot extinction is pressing. While most recent parrot extinctions have been island endemics, the Carolina Parakeet Conuropsis carolinensis had an 18th-century range covering nearly half of the present-day United States, yet mostly disappeared by the end of the 19th century. Despite a great deal of speculation, the major cause of its extinction remains unknown. Establishing the date when a species went extinct is one of the first steps in determining what caused their extinction. While there have been estimates of their extinction date, these analyses used a limited dataset and did not include observational data. We used a recently published, extensive dataset of Carolina Parakeet specimens and observations combined with a Bayesian extinction estimating model to determine the most likely extinction dates. By considering each of the two subspecies independently, we found that they went extinct 30 years apart: the western subspecies C. c. ludovicianus going extinct around 1914 and the eastern subspecies C. c. carolinensis either in the late 1930s or mid-1940s. Had we only considered all observations together, this pattern would have been obscured, possibly missing a major clue in solving the mystery of the parakeet's extinction. Since the Carolina Parakeet was a wide-ranging species that went extinct during a period of rapid agricultural and industrial expansion, conditions that mirror those occurring in many parts of the world where parrot diversity is highest, any progress we make in unraveling the mystery of their disappearance may be vital to modern conservation efforts. ©},

abstract={Freshwater ecosystems are considered amongst the most imperiled on earth, since rivers, lakes, wetlands, and other surface waters receive most of the impacts from unsustainable human activities. This has had measurable impacts on freshwater species, and more specifically on freshwater fishes, as data from the Red List show that 23.5% of the 11,937 freshwater fish species evaluated so far, are classified as threatened. Mexico is not exempt from this situation, as a recent report demonstrates that 39.9% of Mexican freshwater fishes are threatened, and there are 21 lost species (extinct + extinct in the wild), the highest number for any country or region of the world. Here we develop a Theory of Change (ToC) to guide management interventions when seeking to prevent further freshwater fish extinctions in Mexico and reversing the current extinction crisis. We describe four thematic areas of intervention: (1) restoration and reintroduction aimed at eight extinct in the wild and four regionally extinct species, (2) conservation management prioritizing 39 critically endangered species, distinguishing between those inhabiting protected areas, water parks, and those with no management nor protection, (3) explorations to find eight possibly extinct species, and (4) communication and outreach to gain support for conservation interventions. The framework has been developed as a tool for conservation advocates and policymakers to implement and monitor change that prevents extinctions, but also to seek and attract funding. It is also meant to guide different levels of government in setting priorities for conservation interventions. Copyright © 2022 Contreras-MacBeath, Mejia Mojica and Rivas González.},

abstract={Conventional farming has been implicated in global biodiversity loss, with many farmland birds in decline. Organic farming is often considered a more ecological alternative since it generally hosts greater faunal diversity. To date, the impact of conventional agriculture on the decline in avian species has mainly been assessed through the lens of biodiversity loss; few studies have examined the effects of conventional farming on individual life-history trait components. Behaviour represents the final integrated outcome of a range of biochemical and physiological pathways and can be considered a proxy of health as it is more sensitive than other life-history traits, potentially allowing environmental changes to be better tracked. The goal of this study was to understand how exposure to conventional versus organic farming affects the behaviour of passerine birds in real conditions. By sampling 6 species of passerine birds in 10 hedgerows in organic landscapes and 10 hedgerows in conventional landscapes during the breeding period, we found evidence that organic farming sharply increased the vitality of individuals, irrespective of species. This was measured through behaviour such as flee attempts, aggressivity, pecking and distress calls when captured, all of which were higher in birds caught in organic hedges than those caught in conventional landscapes. We posit that passerines living in organically farmed landscapes benefit from reduced pesticide exposure rather than a greater abundance of food, as body condition was identical in the two contexts. These findings suggest that the behaviour of passerines can be a useful indicator of the state of the environment and can thus serve as an early warning of specific environmental change in agricultural areas. Further studies assessing the life-history traits of farmland birds may be a valuable aid to understanding the impact of conventional agriculture on biodiversity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The pet trade and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) consumption are major drivers of global biodiversity loss. Tokay geckos (Gekko gecko) are among the most traded reptile species worldwide. In Hong Kong, pet and TCM markets sell tokay geckos while wild populations also persist. To clarify connections between trade sources and destinations, we compared genetics and stable isotopes of wild tokays in local and non-local populations to dried individuals from TCM markets across Hong Kong. We found that TCM tokays are likely not of local origin. Most wild tokays were related to individuals in South China, indicating a probable natural origin. However, two populations contained individuals more similar to distant populations, indicating pet trade origins. Our results highlight the complexity of wildlife trade impacts within trade hubs. Such trade dynamics complicate local legal regulation when endangered species are protected, but the same species might also be non-native and possibly damaging to the environment. © 2022 The Author(s).},

abstract={Area-based conservation is essential to safeguard declining biodiversity. Several approaches have been developed for identifying networks of globally important areas based on the delineation of sites or seascapes of importance for various elements of biodiversity (e.g., birds, marine mammals). Sharks, rays, and chimaeras are facing a biodiversity crisis with an estimated 37% of species threatened with extinction driven by overfishing. Yet spatial planning tools often fail to consider the habitat needs critical for their survival. The Important Shark and Ray Area (ISRA) approach is proposed as a response to the dire global status of sharks, rays, and chimaeras. A set of four globally standardized scientific criteria, with seven sub-criteria, was developed based on input collated during four shark, biodiversity, and policy expert workshops conducted in 2022. The ISRA Criteria provide a framework to identify discrete, three-dimensional portions of habitat important for one or more shark, ray, or chimaera species, that have the potential to be delineated and managed for conservation. The ISRA Criteria can be applied to all environments where sharks occur (marine, estuarine, and freshwater) and consider the diversity of species, their complex behaviors and ecology, and biological needs. The identification of ISRAs will guide the development, design, and application of area-based conservation initiatives for sharks, rays, and chimaeras, and contribute to their recovery.

abstract={Biodiversity is facing a global extinction crisis that will reduce ecological trait diversity, evolutionary history, and ultimately ecosystem functioning and services.1–4 A key challenge is understanding how species losses will impact morphological and phylogenetic diversity at global scales.5, 6 Here, we test whether the loss of species threatened with extinction according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) leads to morphological and phylogenetic homogenization7, 8 across both the whole avian class and within each biome and ecoregion globally. We use a comprehensive set of continuous morphological traits extracted from museum collections of 8,455 bird species, including geometric morphometric beak shape data,9 and sequentially remove species from those at most to least threat of extinction. We find evidence of morphological, but not phylogenetic, homogenization across the avian class, with species becoming more alike in terms of their morphology. We find that most biome and ecoregions are expected to lose morphological diversity at a greater rate than predicted by species loss alone, with the most imperiled regions found in East Asia and the Himalayan uplands and foothills. Only a small proportion of assemblages are threatened with phylogenetic homogenization, in particular parts of Indochina. Species extinctions will lead to a major loss of avian ecological strategies, but not a comparable loss of phylogenetic diversity. As the decline of species with unique traits and their replacement with more widespread generalist species continues, the protection of assemblages at most risk of morphological and phylogenetic homogenization should be a key conservation priority. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={With a sixth mass extinction looming and freshwater biodiversity declining at unprecedented rates, evaluating ecological efficacy of river restoration efforts is critical in combatting global biodiversity loss. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the functioning for fishes of 46 river restoration projects in the river Rhine, one of the world's most heavily engineered lowland rivers. Floodplains with permanent, either one- or two-sided lateral connectivity to the main channel, favour total fish abundance, and are essential as nursery areas for riverine fishes. Habitat heterogeneity had a strong positive effect on species richness but was negatively related with fish abundances. However, the effects of environmental variables varied between ecological groups and spatial scales. Surprisingly, richness of critical rheophilic fishes declined with large-scale habitat heterogeneity (~1000 m), while it increased at small scales (~100 m), possibly because of the presence of unfavourable habitats for this ecological group at larger scales. Clearly, there is no one-size-fits-all design for river restoration projects. Whether a river section is free-flowing or impounded dictates the scope and efficacy of restoration projects and, within a river section, multiple complementary restoration projects might be key to mitigate freshwater fish biodiversity loss. An essential element for success is that these projects should retain permanent lateral connection to the main channel. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Endemic vertebrates are a crucial component of biodiversity, yet face disproportionally high extinction risk as climate and land-use changes drive habitat loss. Large protected areas are therefore deemed necessary to mitigate biodiversity loss. In 2021, China’s Giant Panda National Park (GPNP, 27,134 km2) was established in one of the global endemism hotspots. In this study we ask the question whether this large national park is able to conserve the many threatened endemic vertebrates occurring in the region in the face of climate and land-use changes, in order to assess the long-term effectiveness of the GPNP. We used species distribution modeling techniques to project the distributions of 40 threatened terrestrial (and freshwater) endemic vertebrates under land-use and climate change scenarios SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0 and SSP5–8.5 in 2081–2100, and assessed the extent to which their distributions are covered by the GPNP, now and in the future. We found that by 2081–2100, two thirds of the threatened endemic vertebrates are predicted to lose part (15–79%, N = 4) of or (nearly) their entire (80–100% loss, N = 23) range under all three climate and land-use change scenarios. Consequently, fewer species are predicted to occur in the GPNP than at present. Our findings confirm the high vulnerability of threatened endemic species to climate and land-use changes, despite protected areas. Habitat loss due to climate and land-use changes elevate extinction risk of species in endemism hotspots across the globe. Urgent, widespread and intensified mitigation measures and adaptation measures are required at a landscape scale for effective conservation efforts in the future.

abstract={Given the scale of the current biodiversity loss, setting conservation priorities is essential to direct scarce resources to where they will be most effective. Many prioritization schemes have been described by using a wide range of criteria that vary across taxonomic groups, spatial scales, and ecological, socio-economic, and governance contexts. Currently, there is no single prioritization process applicable to all situations, nor is there a list of agreed metrics. The IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group and the Small Mammal Specialist Group recently performed species prioritization exercises based on a similar approach. The variables used included biological, socio-political, and feasibility criteria. The two exercises contained both common and some unique variables, arranged in a matrix for the target species (29 threatened antelopes and 19 critically endangered Mexican small mammals, respectively). The ASG framework provided a global summary of the antelope priorities, which can be updated and adapted to the national level. The SMSG matrix was applied in a regional workshop to select species for which the likelihood of implementing conservation actions was high and led to conservation action plans being developed for six species. The framework we jointly developed in theory can be applied to other taxa, certainly all mammals and perhaps most vertebrates. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Urbanization drastically alters landscapes in ways that can threaten local biodiversity. Although species loss has been well documented in urban habitats, why some species persist and not others, and how species interactions change remain poorly understood, especially for species with specialized niche requirements. Here, we test the hypothesis that urbanization disrupts specialized plant–herbivore interactions, and these effects vary according to the characteristics of both cities and the features of the organisms themselves. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed milkweed specialist herbivore communities in the early and late growing season of the common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) across six cities that varied in size by two orders of magnitude. Four results are most important to answering our research questions: (1) the abundance of herbivore species was higher in urban than in rural habitats, whereas leaf herbivory was higher in rural than in urban habitats, and these effects varied between seasons and among cities; (2) the higher species diversity and abundance are likely due to a few species being more associated with rural habitats and other species more common in urban habitats, and thus, urbanization alters insect community composition; (3) the species with the lowest dispersal abilities, Rhyssomatus lineaticollis and Liriomyza asclepiadis, were those that were most strongly affected by urbanization, with R. lineaticollis less abundant and L. asclepiadis more abundant in urban areas; and (4) urbanization influenced plant–herbivore interactions by reducing herbivory, but it did not alter species interactions among herbivorous insects. Biodiversity loss, particularly declines of habitat and host specialists, in urban areas remains a critical concern for conservation. Our results indicate that at least some specialist herbivores are more abundant in urban areas than in rural areas and that species interactions remain intact. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={The current global crisis has one of its worst sides in the biodiversity crisis. Biodiversity loss affects both species and the functionality of ecosystems. This leads to a decrease or loss of ecosystem services, with catastrophic effects on all living beings, including humans. In this sense, education must be another tool that contributes to biodiversity conservation. The aim of this research is to determine the knowledge that pre-service preschool teachers have about vertebrate animals. The results indicate that there is little knowledge of the native fauna (from a nearby regional geographical area). In this case we consider native fauna the fauna of the Iberian Peninsula, as this is the location of the research. The scarce knowledge of the native fauna can be an obstacle to its teaching and therefore to its conservation. In this sense, training actions are needed to provide teachers with knowledge of native biodiversity so that the school can act as a complement to biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Quantifying the magnitude of the global extinction crisis is important but remains challenging, as many extinction events pass unnoticed owing to our limited taxonomic knowledge of the world's organisms. The increasing rarity of many taxa renders comprehensive sampling difficult, further compounding the problem. Vertebrate lineages such as birds, which are thought to be taxonomically well understood, are therefore used as indicator groups for mapping and quantifying global extinction. To test whether extinction patterns are adequately gauged in well-studied groups, we implemented ancient-DNA protocols and retrieved whole genomes from the historic DNA of museum specimens in a widely known songbird radiation of shamas (genus Copsychus) that is assumed to be of least conservation concern. We uncovered cryptic diversity and an unexpected degree of hidden extinction and terminal endangerment. Our analyses reveal that >40% of the phylogenetic diversity of this radiation is already either extinct in the wild or nearly so, including the two genomically most distinct members of this group (omissus and nigricauda), which have so far flown under the conservation radar as they have previously been considered subspecies. Comparing the genomes of modern samples with those from roughly a century ago, we also found a significant decrease in genetic diversity and a concomitant increase in homozygosity affecting various taxa, including small-island endemics that are extinct in the wild as well as subspecies that remain widespread across the continental scale. Our application of modern genomic approaches demonstrates elevated levels of allelic and taxonomic diversity loss in a songbird clade that has not been listed as globally threatened, highlighting the importance of ongoing reassessments of extinction incidence even across well-studied animal groups. Key words: extinction, introgression, white-rumped shama, conservation. © The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.},

abstract={Anthropogenic activities drove an unprecedented rate of land-use change in the last century. Corporate is one of the most highlighted sectors due to the extent of the impact on the environment. Therefore, PROPER (Corporate Performance Rating Assessment for Environmental Program) was developed by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry as a safeguard to halt biodiversity loss due to corporate-related development in Indonesia. The present study analyzed the flora and fauna composition, structure, and trend in PT. Geo Dipa Energi Dieng well pad surrounding area from 2019-2021, as a critical part of the PROPER assessments. The study revealed that the study area was homogeneously dominated by shrubs-herbaceous plants, contributing to 60% of total species richness and abundance. Two dominant species were the introduced wild species Ageratina riparia and the cultivated plant Solanum tuberosum. Moreover, despite tree individual scarcity, the tree growth form was primarily constituted by introduced species with a mean abundance of 347 individuals, or 5-fold higher than native species. Acacia decurrens and Cupressus sempervirens, the introduced tree species planted during the rehabilitation program, dominated the area. The homogeneous floristic composition led to a homogenization of the fauna community, particularly birds, dominated by cosmopolitan insectivorous species. NMDS analysis and Shannon-Diversity Index also revealed that the pattern and trend among sites and years were similar, and there was an insignificant change, showing the urgency of the long-term revegetation programs to rehabilitate the ecosystem. Moreover, the presence of protected species in the study area showed that ecosystem rehabilitation is critical. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Biodiversity loss is one of the greatest global challenges and requires substantial investment in building the capacity of conservation professionals to design and implement robust conservation plans. In this study, we surveyed 155 past participants of training in facilitating species conservation planning processes given by the Conservation Planning Specialist Group of the IUCN Species Survival Commission. Based on a recently developed theory of change for the training, we examined how and to what extent the training contributed to the desired outcome of increasing trainees' capacity for leading the design and facilitation of species conservation planning processes. Our results indicate that recall of training content, self-efficacy (an individual's belief they can complete a specific task or behaviour successfully) and peer network participation had significant impacts on the outcome of applying training content in the workplace. Furthermore, our results suggest that self-efficacy played a highly influential role in trainees' participation in species conservation planning post-training. The implications of this research point to designing conservation training that considers not only the skills and knowledge to be gained by learners but also the strategies that enhance trainees' self-efficacy in applying new skills and knowledge and in establishing peer networks to support trainees in turning training objectives into realities.

abstract={The current extinction crisis requires effective assessment and monitoring tools. Genetic approaches are appealing given the relative ease of field sampling required to estimate genetic diversity characteristics assumed related to population size, evolutionary potential, and extinction risk, and to evaluate hybridization with non-native species simultaneously. However, linkages between population genetic metrics of diversity from survey-style field collections and demographic estimates of population size and extinction risk are still in need of empirical examples, especially for remotely distributed species of conservation concern where the approach might be most beneficial. We capitalized on an exceptional opportunity to evaluate congruence between genetic diversity metrics and demographic-based estimates of abundance and extinction risk from a comprehensive Multiple Population Viability Analysis (MPVA) in a threatened fish, the Lahontan cutthroat trout (LCT). We sequenced non-native trout reference samples and recently collected and archived tissue samples of most remaining populations of LCT (N = 60) and estimated common genetic assessment metrics, predicting minimal hybridization with non-native trout, low diversity, and declining diversity over time. We further hypothesized genetic metrics would correlate positively with MPVA-estimated abundance and negatively with extinction probability. We uncovered several instances of hybridization that pointed to immediate management needs. After removing hybridized individuals, cautious interpretation of low effective population sizes (2–63) suggested reduced evolutionary potential for many LCT populations. Other genetic metrics did not decline over time nor correlate with MPVA-based estimates of harmonic mean abundance or 30-year extinction probability. Our results demonstrate benefits of genetic monitoring for efficiently detecting hybridization and, though genetic results were disconnected from demographic assessment of conservation status, they suggest reduced evolutionary potential and likely a higher conservation risk than currently recognized for this threatened fish. We emphasize that genetic information provides essential complementary insight, in addition to demographic information, for evaluating species status. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Illegal wildlife poisoning is a global threat for biodiversity, yet the magnitude of its impact on ecosystems is largely underestimated as most of poisoning episodes remain undetected. Here, we conducted a large-scale field experiment to better understand the real dimension of the illegal wildlife poisoning in terms of composition and number of species and abundance of impacted individuals, as well as the ecological factors driving it. We used camera traps to monitor simulated poison baits placed in 25 study areas in SW Europe and applied Good–Turing theory to estimate the richness of species of the entire assemblage (observed plus undetected). We recorded 3095 individuals from 39 vertebrate species that consumed 94 % of the baits (N = 590). Yet, using sample completeness to estimate the entire species assemblage yielded a total of 47 species exposed to illegal poisoning. The observed assemblage included different trophic and functional groups (from lizards and snakes to apex species among birds and mammals), as well as a 38 % of threatened and near threatened species (according to Spanish and Portuguese vertebrate red list and UICN list). The size (weight) of the bait outstands as a reliable predictor of the number of species (0–8 species/bait, mean = 2) and individuals (0–99 individuals/bait, mean = 5) susceptible to poisoning. The habitat where the bait was placed modulated the abundance of individuals affected (greater in open than in closed habitats). Type of bait and habitat drove the compositional variation of species. Our approach enables uncover entire species assemblages prone to illegal poisoning and their ecological drivers associated, advancing the understanding of the impact of wildlife poisoning in ecosystems. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Knowledge of primate evolutionary history from the Late Miocene to the present in East Asia is necessary to develop a conservation strategy for primates today and future. This background is especially evident from the distributions of fossil-bearing sites in the Pleistocene and historical records over the past 800 years. We illustrate catarrhines' early dispersal and radiation routes, paths, and later shrinking trajectories, providing robust evidence and information for making or amending conservation strategies. Catarrhines (apes and Old-World monkeys) in East Asia are analyzed in this study. The results indicate that their spread during the Pleistocene from the west to east remarkably involved the three river systems (Yangtze, Yellow, and Pearl) and the coastlines, resulting in broad distributions in the Far East (Taiwan, Korea, and Japan). Unfortunately, their continental taxa significantly suffered reductions from ancient to modern Holocene, leading to a tremendous biodiversity loss in East Asia. These events corresponded to major periodic social upheavals and anthropogenic activities, particularly in the first half of the last century and the post-war period after 1950 that has involved unparalleled environmental devastation and natural resource depletion. Except for the taxa in Taiwan and Japan, primates in East Asia will finally be confined to Southwest China, especially a Convergence-Divergence Center (CDC) that has played a unique role in shielding primates and other animals, as well as the plants since the Later Miocene. Thus, developing a specific conservation priority is critical for the CDC and its adjacent regions to mitigate primate extinction in East Asia. © 2022},

abstract={Human-driven biodiversity loss is progressively becoming a problem with dramatic consequences for the conservation of vital ecosystems. The increasing number of illegal killings of the grey wolf (Canis lupus, Linnaeus, 1758), a threatened species, displays the need for investigation and prosecution of such offences. Forensic entomology makes use of the knowledge about necrophagous insects to estimate a minimum time-since-death interval of the deceased person or animal, which can give important information on a possible perpetrator. The cadaver fauna along five decomposition stages of wolves in Germany was investigated in the period 2014–2021. The insects from 70 wolf cadavers, originating from all over Germany, were provided by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research Berlin. The accumulated degree day (ADD) model was applied for the post-mortem interval estimation on wolf cadavers for the first time. A total of 20 coleopteran species and 14 different dipteran species were discovered and identified. Almost 99 % of all insect specimens were from the order of Diptera, and beetles (Coleoptera) accounted for only 1 % of the cadaver fauna. The blowflies (Calliphoridae) are of particular importance for forensic issues, accounting for about 66 % of all families. Carrion beetles (Silphidae) were found as the second most abundant family (about 21 %). In addition, combining all cases, a steadily increasing insect species richness S was detected from early decay to advanced decay (fresh S = 8; bloated S = 12; active decay S = 21; advanced decay S = 34). In the following remains stage, the species number decreased again (S = 24). However, no significant difference in the number of species was found between the stages of decay when the cases were considered individually. The temporal pattern of insect appearance was found to be congruent with those of previous studies. Furthermore, a time of death was determined for each case and compared to the pathologist's estimates. This study provides insights into the arthropod fauna of wolf remains for the first time, applies the ADD-Model for post-mortem interval estimation, and discusses the suitability of forensic entomology for wildlife death investigations. © 2022 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences},

abstract={Climate and land-use changes are expected to negatively affect many species and ecological processes, leading to biodiversity loss. However, some species can adapt to these changes. Wide-ranging species are expected to be less impacted by such changes, but they can occur in different domains with contrasting environmental conditions, resulting in different conservation statuses along their range. To understand whether a species will overall benefit or lose with global change, we evaluated the responses of a wide-ranging but a vulnerable bird (Crax fasciolata) to separate and combined effects of climate and land-use changes under different environmental policies in Brazil. Using ecological niche modeling and a land-use model within the Brazilian political context, we quantified climatic, habitat, and environmental suitability for Crax fasciolata under historical (2000) and future (2050) scenarios. Our findings showed that environmental suitability can increase for Crax fasciolata in Brazil in future, but these effects vary according to the domain and the specific future scenario considered. Climatically suitable areas will increase in all scenarios, and those environmental scenarios that include better habitat conditions will provide more environmentally suitable areas for Crax fasciolata. However, this increase comes from newly suitable areas in the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon, while the Pantanal, the Caatinga, and the Cerrado will lose environmental suitability due to native vegetation loss. Despite the availability of these new areas, reduced landscape permeability may hinder Crax fasciolata from reaching them. This reinforces the urgent call for public policies for native vegetation protection, reforestation, and effective deforestation control.

abstract={The Phu Quoc marine protected area (MPA) is a multiple-use MPA that was established in 2007 and is a component of Vietnam’s National MPA System. The MPA is divided into two spatially separated zones based on habitat type: a seagrass zone and a coral reef zone. In this study, visual census data were collected in 2018–2019 and were used to derive fish biomass and community diversity metrics as proxies for ecosystem condition and function (trophic and mobility). The effectiveness of the MPA in protecting fish communities in the seagrass and coral reef zones was evaluated. An updated characterization of the Phu Quoc fish communities, and an assessment of fish community variation among regions and between habitat types, is provided. In total, 125 species representing 74 genera of 40 families were recorded. Omnivores were the most abundant (38%), followed by planktivores (24%), whereas piscivores (2%) were scarce. There was an especially low density of high-value fishery target species such as Haemulidae (<0.01%), Carangidae (<0.2%), Lethrinidae (<0.3%), Lutjanidae (<0.4%), Serranidae (<2%), and Chaetodontidae (<3%). Alarmingly, fishes with a total length of >20 cm only accounted for 1% of the total individuals. Species and functional composition were similar between protected and unprotected areas but differed among regions and between habitats. These results suggest that the protection of fishes provided by Phu Quoc MPA at the time of this study was ineffective. The taxonomic composition of fish communities has remained relatively unchanged over the last approximately 25 years, with the density of large fishes and commercial species remaining low. There is capacity to improve MPA performance by providing adequate resources for threat management and using evidence-based decision-making in management. The 2020 rezoning and expansion of the Phu Quoc MPA is discussed with regards to prioritizing biodiversity and coverage targets. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The example of Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae), the world's smallest primate, illustrates how conservation efforts are failing because this “critically endangered” lemur species (Markolf et al. 2020) is feared to be extinct only 30 years after its discovery, even though its entire global range is situated inside a protected area. Numerous other lemurs, who have a higher percentage of CR/EN/VU species than any other group of mammals, are facing very similar prospects, despite this globally most endangered group of mammals enjoying particular attention from conservation policy makers and activists for decades because their endemic populations have been rapidly declining in shrinking habitats. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={The ongoing biodiversity crisis calls for accurate estimation of animal density and abundance to identify sources of biodiversity decline and effectiveness of conservation interventions. Camera traps together with abundance estimation methods are often employed for this purpose. The necessary distances between camera and observed animals are traditionally derived in a laborious, fully manual or semi-automatic process. Both approaches require reference image material, which is both difficult to acquire and not available for existing datasets. We propose a fully automatic approach we call AUtomated DIstance esTimation (AUDIT) to estimate camera-to-animal distances. We leverage existing state-of-the-art relative monocular depth estimation and combine it with a novel alignment procedure to estimate metric distances. AUDIT is fully automated and requires neither the comparison of observations in camera trap imagery with reference images nor capturing of reference image material at all. AUDIT therefore relieves biologists and ecologists from a significant workload. We evaluate AUDIT on a zoo scenario dataset unseen during training where we achieve a mean absolute distance estimation error over all animal instances of only 0.9864 m and mean relative error (REL) of 0.113.

abstract={Grazing and global change (e.g., warming, nitrogen deposition, and altered precipitation) both contribute to biodiversity loss and alter ecosystem structure and functioning. However, how grazing and global change interactively influence plant diversity and ecosystem productivity, and their relationship remains unclear at the global scale. Here, we synthesized 73 field studies to quantify the individual and/or interactive effects of grazing and global change factors on biodiversity-productivity relationship in grasslands. Our results showed that grazing significantly reduced plant richness by 3.7% and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) by 29.1%, but increased belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) by 9.3%. Global change factors, however, decreased richness by 8.0% but increased ANPP and BNPP by 13.4% and 14.9%, respectively. Interestingly, the strength of the change in biodiversity in response to grazing was positively correlated with the strength of the change in BNPP. Yet, global change flipped these relationships from positive to negative even when combined with grazing. These results indicate that the impacts of global change factors are more dominant than grazing on the belowground biodiversity-productivity relationship, which is contrary to the pattern of aboveground one. Therefore, incorporating global change factors with herbivore grazing into Earth system models is necessary to accurately predict climate-grassland carbon cycle feedbacks in the Anthropocene. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The prevention of biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes to protect ecosystem stability and functions is of major importance in itself and for the maintenance of associated ecosystem services. Intense agriculture leads to a loss in species richness and homogenization of species pools as well as the fragmentation of natural habitats and groundwater pollution. Constructed wetlands stand as nature-based solutions (NBS) to buffer the degradation of water quality by intercepting the transfer of particles, nutrients and pesticides between crops and surface waters. In karstic watersheds where sinkholes short-cut surface water directly to groundwater increasing water resource vulnerability, constructed wetlands are recommended to mitigate agricultural pollutants. Constructed wetlands also have the potential to improve landscape connectivity by providing refuge and breeding sites for wildlife, especially for amphibians. We propose here a methodology to identify optimal locations for water pollution mitigation using constructed wetlands from the perspective of habitat connectivity. We use ecological niche modelling at the regional scale to model the potential of habitat suitability for nine amphibian species, and to infer how the landscape impedes species movements. We combine those results to graph theory to identify connectivity priorities at the operational scale of an agricultural catchment area. Our framework allowed us to identify optimal areas from the point of view of the species, to analyze the effect of multifunctional constructed wetlands aiming to both reduce water pollution and to improve amphibian species habitat overall connectivity. More generally, we show the potential of habitat connectivity assessment to improve multifunctionality of NBS for pollution mitigation. © 2022},

abstract={Mounting observational records demonstrate human-caused faunal decline in recent decades, while accumulating archaeological evidence suggests an early biodiversity impact of human activities during the Holocene. A fundamental question arises concerning whether modern wildlife population declines began during early human disturbance. Here, we performed a population genomic analysis of six common forest birds in East Asia to address this question. For five of them, demographic history inference based on 25–33 genomes of each species revealed dramatic population declines by 4- to 48-fold over millennia (e.g. 2000–5000 thousand years ago). Nevertheless, summary statistics detected nonsignificant correlations between these population size trajectories and Holocene temperature variations, and ecological niche models explicitly predicted extensive range persistence during the Holocene, implying limited demographic consequence of Holocene climate change. Further analyses suggest high negative correlations between the reconstructed population declines and human disturbance intensities and indicate a potential driver of human activities. These findings provide a deep-time and large-scale insight into the recently recognized avifaunal decline and support an early origin hypothesis of human effects on biodiversity. Overall, our study sheds light on the current biodiversity crisis in the context of long-term human–environment interactions and offers a multi-evidential framework for quantitatively assessing the ecological consequences of human disturbance. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Climate and land-use changes are among the most important drivers of biodiversity loss and, moreover, their impacts on biodiversity are expected to increase further in the 21st century. In this study, the future impact of climate and land-use changes on Anatolian ground squirrels (Spermophilus xanthoprymnus) was assessed. Accordingly, a hierarchical approach with two steps was used. First, ecological niche modelling was used to assess the impact of climate change in areas accessible to Anatolian ground squirrels through dispersal (i.e. the impact of climate change). Second, based on the habitat preferences of ground squirrels, land-use data were used to assess the impact of land-use change in suitable bioclimatic areas for Anatolian ground squirrels under present and future conditions (i.e. the combined impact of both changes). Also, priority areas for the conservation of Anatolian ground squirrels were identified based on in-situ climate change refugia. This study represents a first attempt to combine niche modelling and land-use data for a species in Anatolia, one of the most vulnerable regions to the drivers of biodiversity loss, because it is the region where three of biodiversity hotspots meet, and interact. Habitat suitability (i.e. suitable habitats across suitable bioclimatic areas) was projected to decline by 19–69% in the future (depending on the scenario), mainly due to the loss of suitable bioclimatic areas (47–77%, depending on the scenario) at lower elevations and in the western part of the central Anatolia and in the eastern Anatolia, suggesting that Anatolian ground squirrels will contract their range in the future, mainly due to climate change. Thus, in-situ climate change refugia were projected mainly in the eastern and southeastern parts of the central Anatolia, suggesting these regions as priority areas for the conservation of Anatolian ground squirrels. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Wildlife populations face significant threats, including habitat loss and climate change. However, the United States has faced major biodiversity crises in the past. In 1937, in response to dwindling wildlife populations, Congress passed the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act, known as “Pittman-Robertson” (PR). The law helped restore wildlife populations by establishing a federal role in funding state wildlife agencies enabling states to develop the infrastructure and expertise for effective wildlife conservation. Now, the 117th Congress is considering the Recovering America's Wildlife Act (RAWA). RAWA would provide state, tribal, and territorial wildlife agencies the funding to implement their State Wildlife Action Plans for the conservation of nongame wildlife. Herein, we explore the relationship between PR and RAWA while tracing the historical roots of PR and discussing its successes and limitations. We also demonstrate how RAWA builds upon PR and could become a generational conservation accomplishment. © 2022 The Authors. Conservation Letters published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={Human activities alter ecosystems everywhere, causing rapid biodiversity loss and biotic homogenization. These losses necessitate coordinated conservation actions guided by biodiversity and species distribution spatial data that cover large areas yet have fine-enough resolution to be management-relevant (i.e., ≤5 km). However, most biodiversity products are too coarse for management or are only available for small areas. Furthermore, many maps generated for biodiversity assessment and conservation do not explicitly quantify the inherent tradeoff between resolution and accuracy when predicting biodiversity patterns. Our goals were to generate predictive models of overall breeding bird species richness and species richness of different guilds based on nine functional or life-history-based traits across the conterminous United States at three resolutions (0.5, 2.5, and 5 km) and quantify the tradeoff between resolution and accuracy and, hence, relevance for management of the resulting biodiversity maps. We summarized 18 years of North American Breeding Bird Survey data (1992–2019) and modeled species richness using random forests, including 66 predictor variables (describing climate, vegetation, geomorphology, and anthropogenic conditions), 20 of which we newly derived. Among the three spatial resolutions, the percentage variance explained ranged from 27% to 60% (median = 54%; mean = 57%) for overall species richness and 12% to 87% (median = 61%; mean = 58%) for our different guilds. Overall species richness and guild-specific species richness were best explained at 5-km resolution using ~24 predictor variables based on percentage variance explained, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error values. However, our 2.5-km-resolution maps were almost as accurate and provided more spatially detailed information, which is why we recommend them for most management applications. Our results represent the first consistent, occurrence-based, and nationwide maps of breeding bird richness with a thorough accuracy assessment that are also spatially detailed enough to inform local management decisions. More broadly, our findings highlight the importance of explicitly considering tradeoffs between resolution and accuracy to create management-relevant biodiversity products for large areas. © 2022 The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={One of the most pressing dilemmas of our time is determining how to satisfy the demands of a growing human population while still conserving biodiversity. Worldwide, land modification to accommodate human resource needs has caused significant declines in wildlife populations. To help minimize biodiversity loss, we must support wildlife on human-dominated land, such as farms and urban areas, but our knowledge of how to do so is lacking. Agriculture is a major driver of land modification; but also has the potential to play a role in conserving biodiversity. To support critically endangered ecosystem engineers that use farms, such as giant Galapagos tortoises, we need to understand the characteristics encouraging or hindering them. To quantify tortoise habitat preferences, we assessed the relationship between tortoise density, habitat structure, and land-use type, by recording tortoise density on farms on Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos, over two years. Tortoise density was lowest in abandoned farmland and highest in tourist areas and was most strongly positively correlated with abundant ground cover, short vegetation, and few shrubs. The habitat features favoured by tortoises could potentially be manipulated to help support tortoise conservation on farms. Measuring wildlife preferences in human-dominated areas is an important step towards balancing biodiversity conservation and human-enterprise. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Dedicated long-term monitoring at appropriate spatial and temporal scales is necessary to understand biodiversity losses and develop effective conservation plans. Wildlife monitoring is often achieved by obtaining data at a combination of spatial scales, ranging from local to broad, to understand the status, trends, and drivers of individual species or whole communities and their dynamics. However, limited resources for monitoring necessitates tradeoffs in the scope and scale of data collection. Careful consideration of the spatial and temporal allocation of finite sampling effort is crucial for monitoring programs that span multiple spatial scales. Here we evaluate the ability of five monitoring designs—stratified random, weighted effort, indicator unit, rotating panel, and split panel—to recover parameter values that describe the status (occupancy), trends (change in occupancy), and drivers (spatially varying covariate and an autologistic term) of wildlife communities at two spatial scales. Using an amphibian monitoring program that spans a network of US national parks as a motivating example, we conducted a simulation study for a regional community occupancy sampling program to compare the monitoring designs across varying levels of sampling effort (ranging from 10% to 50%). We found that the stratified random design outperformed the other designs for most parameters of interest at both scales and was thus generally preferable in balancing the estimation of status, trends, and drivers across scales. However, we found that other designs had improved performance in specific situations. For example, the rotating panel design performed best at estimating spatial drivers at a regional level. Thus, our results highlight the nuanced scenarios in which various design strategies may be preferred and offer guidance as to how managers can balance common tradeoffs in large-scale and long-term monitoring programs in terms of the specific knowledge gained. Monitoring designs that improve accuracy in parameter estimates are needed to guide conservation policy and management decisions in the face of broad-scale environmental challenges, but the preferred design is sensitive to the specific objectives of a monitoring program. © 2022 The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Urbanization is a major driver of tropical biodiversity loss. In temperate regions avian species richness–urbanization intensity relationships typically exhibit unimodal patterns, with peak richness at intermediate urbanization levels. In tropical regions, the form of such relationships and the extent to which they are moderated by patches of seminatural habitat are unclear. We address these questions in Bangkok, Thailand (one of the largest and most rapidly expanding tropical mega-cities) and generate conservation recommendations for tropical biodiversity in urban locations. We use repeated point count surveys at a random location, and the largest available woodland patch, in 150 1 km × 1 km grid cells selected along the urbanization gradient. Woodland patches support higher species richness compared with randomized locations (except for non-natives), and avian species richness declines linearly with increasing urbanization. The contrast with unimodal patterns in temperate regions is probably driven by divergent patterns of habitat heterogeneity along tropical and temperate urbanization gradients. Moreover, we provide novel evidence that retaining patches of urban woodland moderates adverse impacts of urbanization on avian species richness. For most species groups, the benefits of woodland increase as urbanization intensifies, despite such woodland patches being very small (mean of 0.38 ha). Avian species richness in woodland patches is maximized, and community composition less similar to that in randomized locations, when woodland patches are larger and visited by fewer people. Assemblages of forest-dependent species (which provide additional ecological functions) have higher richness, and are less similar to those in randomized locations, in patches of woodland with higher tree species richness and biomass. Finally, species richness in randomized sites is greatest when they are closer to woodland patches, and such assemblages more closely resemble those of woodland sites. Our work highlights four strategies for tropical urban bird conservation: (1) conserving woodland patches across the urbanization gradient regardless of patch size, (2) improving the quality of existing woodland by increasing tree biomass and diversity, (3) creating additional woodland that is well distributed throughout the urban area to minimize effects of habitat isolation and (4) reducing human disturbance, especially in areas of the highest habitat quality, while ensuring that the benefits of connecting people to nature are realized in other locations. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={This study aims to explore the income-biodiversity loss nexus in South and Southeast Asian countries covering the period between 2013 and 2019. Negative Binomial regression models are used to deal with the count regressand variable with specific emphasis on different taxonomic groups of threatened species, namely, mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, fish, mollusk, other invertebrate, plant, and total threatened species. We find strong support of an inverted U-shaped relationship between income and biodiversity loss in all taxonomic groups of threatened species examined. Additionally, agricultural land has a significant and positive effect on biodiversity loss. Control of corruption and biodiversity loss are found to be negatively associated. The inverted U-shaped EKC suggests that South and Southeast Asian countries are required to identify policy priority areas that could achieve robust economic growth while reducing biodiversity loss. Our findings also provide valuable policy insights to assist the policy makers to better cope with the problem of biodiversity loss via corruption control and agricultural land use. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Global biodiversitytargets require us to identify species at risk of extinction and quantify status and trends of biodiversity. The Red List Index (RLI) tracks trends in the conservation status of entire species groups over time by monitoring changes in categories assigned to species. Here, we calculate this index for the world’s fishes in 2010, using a sampled approach to the RLI based on a randomly selected sample of 1,500 species, and also present RLI splits for freshwater and marine systems separately. We further compare specific traits of a worldwide fish list to our sample to assess its representativeness. Overall, 15.1% of species in the sample were estimated to be threatened with extinction, resulting in a sampled RLI of 0.914 for all species, 0.968 in marine and 0.862 in freshwater ecosystems. Our sample showed fishing as the principal threat for marine species, and pollution by agricultural and forestry effluents for freshwater fishes. The sampled list provides a robust representation for tracking trends in the conservation status of the world’s fishes, including disaggregated sampled indices for marine and freshwater fish. Reassessment and backcasting of this index is urgent to check the achievement of the commitments proposed in global biodiversity targets. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Deforestation and fragmentation are pervasive drivers of biodiversity loss, but how they scale up to entire landscapes remains poorly understood. Here, we apply species-habitat networks based on species co-occurrences to test the effects of insular fragmentation on multiple taxa-medium-large mammals, small nonvolant mammals, lizards, understory birds, frogs, dung beetles, orchid bees, and trees-across 22 forest islands and three continuous forest sites within a river-damming quasi-experimental landscape in Central Amazonia. Widespread, nonrandom local species extinctions were translated into highly nested networks of low connectance and modularity. Networks' robustness considering the sequential removal of large-to-small sites was generally low; between 5% (dung beetles) and 50% (orchid bees) of species persisted when retaining only <10 ha of islands. In turn, larger sites and body size were the main attributes structuring the networks. Our results raise the prospects that insular forest fragmentation results in simplified species-habitat networks, with distinct taxa persistence to habitat loss. © 2022 The Authors.},

abstract={Concerns over the capacity of the world’s existing agricultural land to provide food for the global population under climate change and continued biodiversity loss have set the stage for a prevailing narrative of inherent tradeoffs with agricultural production. Coffee, a major export of tropical countries, offers a unique opportunity to examine how different management practices can lead to a variety of outcomes in food security, ecosystem services, and biodiversity conservation. Our study examined this intersection to identify tradeoffs and synergies using compiled data from Puerto Rico. At the island level, we analyzed data on coffee yield and planted area under shade or sun management. At the farm level, we analyzed management variables (percent shade cover, maximum canopy height, ground cover, and food crop richness), non-provisioning ecosystem services variables (total farm carbon storage, soil organic carbon storage, coffee plant carbon biomass, and hurricane resistance and resilience), and biodiversity variables (ant, bird, and lizard richness and abundance). At the island level, we found that planted area was the most significant predictor of total production, suggesting no obvious tradeoff between production and shade management in coffee farms. At the farm level, canopy cover of shade trees was negatively correlated with ground cover and positively correlated with food crop richness, suggesting a synergy between agroforestry and subsistence food production. We detected mostly synergies associated with ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and agroforestry management and no tradeoffs among ecosystem service and biodiversity parameters. Shade canopy cover significantly increased total carbon storage, coffee plant biomass, hurricane resistance, and bird species richness. Shade canopy height had a similar positive effect on total farm carbon storage while food crop richness had a positive effect on farm resilience following Hurricane Maria. Ground cover was positively associated with soil carbon storage and pest-controlling lizard abundance. Tradeoffs related to agroforestry management included an inverse relationship between ground cover and hurricane resistance and more dominance of an invasive ant species in farms with higher shade canopies. We discuss the implications of practicing agroforestry principles in this smallholder coffee system and highlight opportunities to contribute to more diversified food production systems that support biodiversity and ecosystem services.

abstract={Wetland ecosystems are diverse, productive habitats that are essential reservoirs of biodiversity. Not only are they home to numerous wetland-specialist species, but they also provide food, water, and shelter that support terrestrial wildlife populations. However, like observed patterns of biodiversity loss, wetland habitats have experienced widespread loss and degradation. In order to conserve and restore wetlands, and thereby the biodiversity they support, it is important to understand how biodiversity in wetland habitats is maintained. Habitat heterogeneity and connectivity are thought to be predominate drivers of wetland biodiversity. We quantified temporal coherence (i.e., spatial synchrony) of wetland invertebrate communities using intra-class correlations among 16 wetlands sampled continuously over 24 years to better understand the relative influences wetland heterogeneity (i.e., internal processes specific to individual wetlands and spatial connectivity and external processes occurring on the landscape) on wetland biodiversity. We found that while wetlands with different ponded-water regimes (temporarily ponded or permanently ponded) often hosted different invertebrate communities, temporal shifts in invertebrate composition were synchronous. We also found the relative importance of internal versus external forces in determining community assembly vary depending on a wetland’s hydrologic function and climate influences. Our results confirm that heterogeneity and spatial connectivity of wetland landscapes are important drivers of wetland biodiversity. Copyright © 2022 McLean, Mushet and Sweetman.},

abstract={Increasing levels of artificial light at night (ALAN) are a major threat to global biodiversity and can have negative impacts on a wide variety of organisms and their ecosystems. Nocturnal species such as bats are highly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of ALAN. A variety of lighting management strategies have been adopted to minimise the impacts of ALAN on wildlife, however relatively little is known about their effectiveness. Using an experimental approach, we provide the first evidence of negative impacts of part-night lighting (PNL) strategies on bats. Feeding activity of Myotis spp. was reduced along rivers exposed to PNL despite no reduction in overall bat activity. We also provide the first evidence of negative effects of PNL on both feeding and activity for Pipistrellus pipistrellus which has previously been recorded feeding under artificial light. Despite having considerable energy-saving benefits, we outline the potential negative impacts of PNL schemes for bats in riparian habitats. PNL are unlikely to provide desired conservation outcomes for bats, and can potentially fragment important foraging habitats leading to a breakdown of functional connectivity across the landscape. We highlight the potential dichotomy for strategies which attempt to simultaneously address climate change and biodiversity loss and recommend alternative management strategies to limit the impacts of ALAN on biodiversity. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={Insectivorous birds provide key ecosystem services for agricultural production, such as biological pest control. However, habitat loss and degradation by agriculture are among the main causes of biodiversity loss globally, including the recent decline in bird populations. Habitat loss has particularly affected insectivorous birds due to the associated decrease in the availability of suitable nesting sites. Our study assessed a tool of ecological intensification to increase insectivorous bird abundance and biological control in vineyards. We evaluated the effects of nest boxes on prey removal by insectivorous birds in five vineyards in central Chile, using a two-year sentinel prey experimental trial. Our results showed significantly more sentinel larvae removal by birds in plots with nest boxes than control plots. Deploying the nest boxes resulted in a 43% higher consumption of sentinel prey. Therefore, we recommend using nest boxes as an environmentally-friendly method to increase native predators and enhance biological control in agricultural fields. This would have the potential to improve biodiversity conservation and maximize crop yields. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Land-use change is the main driver of biodiversity loss in the Mediterranean basin. New socio-economic conditions produced a rewilding process so that cultural landscapes are being invaded by more natural habitats. We analyze the effects of landscape change on the demography and the spatial distribution of Crocidura russula in six protected areas of the western Mediterranean basin. The study was conducted in the period 2008–2020 on 19 live trapping plots representing the three main natural habitats of the area (scrubland, pinewood, and holm oak woodland). We used a multiscale approach to ensure that the scale of response matched landscape structure (from plot to landscape) using either vegetation profiles (LiDAR) and land use data obtained from years 2007 and 2017. Statistical models (multiple-season single-species occupancy models) showed that C. russula populations were strongly associated to habitat features at the plot level. These models were used to predict occupancy at sampling units for the whole study area (850 km2), showing contrasting trends that shifted at relatively small spatial scales (expansions and retractions of species ranges). Parks showing extreme scrubland encroachment (−8% of area) and afforestation (+6%) significantly reduced habitat suitability for shrews and reductions in occupancy (−5%). Results would indicate faster changes in the spatial distribution of the target species than previously expected on the basis of climate change, driven by fast landscape changes. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Human-mediated disturbances appear to be ever-increasing and wide-ranging, and if we are to mitigate biodiversity loss, it is essential that we continue to survey and monitor both poorly known and well-understood ecosystems. This recommendation may be especially relevant for Australian herpetofauna, including many snake taxa, as many species are small, morphologically and/or behaviorally cryptic, and occur in specialized ecosystems. Here, we describe a westerly range extension and present the first records of the De Vis’ Banded Snake (Denisonia devisi) in South Australia. We also describe the habitat and our observations of behavior, foraging, and refugia, and discuss potential conservation concerns and recommendations for this newly discovered population. Our discovery contextualizes the need for ongoing fauna surveys, especially near jurisdictional borders. Detection of new populations of fringing taxa will undoubtedly continue to occur across Australia and may have implications for conservation management. © 2022. Shawn Scott. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The nature-based solutions (NBS) concept is an umbrella term that connects and organizes previous concepts from the ’green-concept family’. Therefore, interventions similar to NBS were used for a long time before this term was first introduced. Such pre-existing actions, to be considered as NBS, must meet the Global Standards formulated by the Union for Conservation of Nature Global Standards. One of these standards refers to the challenge-orientation of NBS. The aim of this study was to propose objective criteria that enable the assessment of the challenge-orientation of such interventions. To this end, a set of criteria referring to the seven societal challenges was presented. A Lublin city (Poland) case study was applied in relation to 24 types of interventions. The results showed that all of the analysed pre-existing actions met at least two of the challenges. The actions with the greatest challenge-orientation potential continuity for ecological networks are: protecting surface wetlands, public parks, allotment gardens, restoring waterbodies and maintaining floodplains, and the lowest potential are: creating nesting boxes for bats and insect hotels, installing apiaries and below-ground rainwater collection systems. The analysed interventions responded, to a greater extent, to challenges such as to human health, climate change adaptation and mitigation and ecosystem degradation/biodiversity loss, and, to the least extent, to food security and socioeconomic development Moreover, the study revealed that the scale of the pre-existing intervention type is too general to draw conclusions regarding its challenge-orientation: each piece of the intervention should be assessed separately in relation to the conditions in the local context. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Given the rate of biodiversity loss, there is an urgent need to understand community-level responses to extirpation events, with two prevailing hypotheses. On one hand, the loss of an apex predator leads to an increase in primary prey species, triggering a trophic cascade of other changes within the community, while density compensation and ecological release can occur because of reduced competition for resources and absence of direct aggression. White-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari—WLP), a species that typically co-occurs with collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), undergo major population crashes—often taking 20 to 30-years for populations to recover. Using a temporally replicated camera trapping dataset, in both a pre- and post- WLP crash, we explore how WLP disappearance alters the structure of a Neotropical vertebrate community with findings indicative of density compensation. White-lipped peccary were the most frequently detected terrestrial mammal in the 2006–2007 pre-population crash period but were undetected during the 2019 post-crash survey. Panthera onca (jaguar) camera trap encounter rates declined by 63% following the WLP crash, while collared peccary, puma (Puma concolor), red-brocket deer (Mazama americana) and short-eared dog (Atelocynus microtis) all displayed greater encounter rates (490%, 150%, 280%, and 500% respectively), and increased in rank-abundance. Absence of WLP was correlated with ecological release changes in habitat-use for six species, with the greatest increase in use in the preferred floodplain habitat of the WLP. Surprisingly, community-weighted mean trait distributions (body size, feeding guild and nocturnality) did not change, suggesting functional redundancy in diverse tropical mammal assemblages. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Halting biodiversity loss is a major contemporary challenge. Nature protection can help conserve biodiversity, but increasing wildlife numbers inside protected areas and shrinking habitats intensify interactions between humans and wildlife, potentially causing human–wildlife conflict (HWC). Contemporary narratives of HWC highlight detrimental effects on households' socioeconomic outcomes. Despite a wealth of literature on HWC, many studies remain descriptive and little inferential evidence has been provided. Here we identify the determinants and effects of reported HWC on household outcomes using spatial predictors and an original farm-household dataset collected in Namibia's share of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. In addition to dependence on agriculture, we find that community-based conservation, the share of a community's area set aside for conservation, and habitat connectivity are key drivers of HWC. Contrary to contemporary narratives of HWC, we find that reported conflicts did not have strong negative effects on household income and livelihood diversity. Conversely, community-based wildlife conservation increases income and livelihood diversity among participating households. It is, however, also associated with food insecurity concerns. Such concerns may be driven by comparatively higher restrictions related to land use planning and zoning that constrain productive land uses, such as agriculture. Our findings suggest that community-based conservation can create development synergies for households in favorable environments, despite increasing HWC risks. However, potential trade-offs including non-material costs warrant further research. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={We live in a world characterized by biodiversity loss and global environmental change. The extinction of large carnivores can have ramifying effects on ecosystems like an uncontrolled increase in wild herbivores, which in turn can have knock-on impacts on vegetation regeneration and communities. Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) serve important ecosystem functions as apex predators; yet, they are quickly heading towards an uncertain future. Threatened by habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict and illegal trafficking, there are only approximately 7100 individuals remaining in nature. We present the most comprehensive genome-wide analysis of cheetah phylogeography and conservation genomics to date, assembling samples from nearly the entire current and past species' range. We show that their phylogeography is more complex than previously thought, and that East African cheetahs (A. j. raineyi) are genetically distinct from Southern African individuals (A. j. jubatus), warranting their recognition as a distinct subspecies. We found strong genetic differentiation between all classically recognized subspecies, thus refuting earlier findings that cheetahs show only little differentiation. The strongest differentiation was observed between the Asiatic and all the African subspecies. We detected high inbreeding in the Critically Endangered Iranian (A. j. venaticus) and North-western (A. j. hecki) subspecies, and show that overall cheetahs, along with snow leopards, have the lowest genome-wide heterozygosity of all the big cats. This further emphasizes the cheetah's perilous conservation status. Our results provide novel and important information on cheetah phylogeography that can support evidence-based conservation policy decisions to help protect this species. This is especially relevant in light of ongoing and proposed translocations across subspecies boundaries, and the increasing threats of illegal trafficking. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Unsustainable hunting is one of the leading drivers of global biodiversity loss, yet very few direct measures exist due to the difficulty in monitoring this cryptic activity. Where guns are commonly used for hunting, such as in the tropical forests of the Americas and Africa, acoustic detection can potentially provide a solution to this monitoring challenge. The emergence of low cost autonomous recording units (ARUs) brings into reach the ability to monitor hunting pressure over wide spatial and temporal scales. However, ARUs produce immense amounts of data, and long term and large-scale monitoring is not possible without efficient automated sound classification techniques. We tested the effectiveness of a sequential two-stage detection pipeline for detecting gunshots from acoustic data collected in the tropical forests of Belize. The pipeline involved an on-board detection algorithm which was developed and tested in a prior study, followed by a spectrogram based convolutional neural network (CNN), which was developed in this manuscript. As gunshots are rare events, we focussed on developing a classification pipeline that maximises recall at the cost of increased false positives, with the aim of using the classifier to assist human annotation of files. We trained the CNN on annotated data collected across two study sites in Belize, comprising 597 gunshots and 28,195 background sounds. Predictions from the annotated validation dataset comprising 150 gunshots and 7044 background sounds collected from the same sites yielded a recall of 0.95 and precision of 0.85. The combined recall of the two-step pipeline was estimated at 0.80. We subsequently applied the CNN to an un-annotated dataset of over 160,000 files collected in a spatially distinct study site to test for generalisability and precision under a more realistic monitoring scenario. Our model was able to generalise to this dataset, and classified gunshots with 0.57 precision and estimated 80% recall, producing a substantially more manageable dataset for human verification. Using a classifier-guided listening approach such as ours can make wide scale monitoring of threats such as hunting a feasible option for conservation management. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={In Western and Central Mediterranean countries proteases from wild herbaceous perennial plants commonly known as “thistles” have been used as milk coagulants in cheese-making for centuries. For the first time, the technological and biochemical traits of proteases from cultivated Onopordum tauricum Willd. (Taurian thistle, bull cottonthistle) were assessed. The optimal conditions for minimizing the clotting time and the non-specific proteolytic activity were estimated at the highest (T = 43–45 °C; [Ca2+] = 11–13 mM) and the lowest (T = 35–39 °C; [Ca2+] = 5 mM) temperature and calcium ion levels in the explored range respectively, thus highlighting the difficulty to set the best operative compromise in the first step of cheesemaking. In the conditions adopted in common cheesemaking practice (T = 37 °C; pH = 6.5) 1 mL of reconstituted extract from cultivated thistles coagulated 10 mL of ewe's and goat's milk in 114–146 and 129–167 s, respectively, and 1 mL of reconstituted extract from spontaneous thistles coagulated 10 mL of ewe's and goat's milk in 232–294 and 428–621 s, respectively, while no significant differences in the non-specific proteolytic activity between cultivated and spontaneous O. tauricum extracts were observed. The purified enzyme (tauricosin) was identified as an aspartic protease made up of two sub-units with molecular weights of 32 and 9.6 kDa, respectively. Experimental data encouraged the exploitation of O. tauricum as a new and sustainable non-food crop in marginal and rainfed lands of Mediterranean countries, thus reducing the potential biodiversity losses due to wild collection. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Despite being naturally fishless, the widespread introduction of trout and minnows is threatening the conservation of high mountain lakes all over the world. Previous studies have reported that amphibians quickly disappear after trout introduction, followed by many conspicuous invertebrates. Here, we have studied the effects of minnows versus trout on the littoral macroinvertebrate community of 54 high mountain lakes from the Pyrenees, covering a gradient of environmental characteristics. The relative importance of fish compared to other variables in explaining macroinvertebrate communities was assessed using distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) and multivariate regression tree (MRT) to find the main environmental thresholds. Both dbRDA and MRT approaches revealed that minnow density was the most important variable negatively determining community structure, followed by aquatic macrophytes, which increased taxa richness. The occurrence and abundance of relevant taxa was analysed in relation to fish densities and other environmental factors using binomial and gamma generalized linear models (GLM). GLM suggested that trout had an impact on the distribution of swimmer taxa and caused declines in the abundance of conspicuous clinger and burrower taxa. Minnows restricted the occurrence of more taxa than trout and negatively affected a wide variety of body sizes and functional groups. Indeed, we found that minnows were responsible for a dramatic biodiversity loss in the littoral macroinvertebrate community. The fast spread of minnows in high mountain areas is of great concern for the conservation of lake macroinvertebrates. Urgent measures to stop minnow introductions are strongly recommended. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={The biodiversity crisis poses a real and present global threat to humanity. The acceleration of species and ecosystem decline coupled with climate change suggests that as it stands, nature cannot absorb the pressure humanity is placing on the planet. Bold new approaches to biodiversity conservation are needed. Promoting an engaged community is an important part of achieving conservation outcomes. Research shows that citizen science has the potential to elicit conservation engagement. However, research has not specifically explored how intensive citizen science expedition programs contribute to change. Here we use transformative learning theory as a tool to investigate how participation in citizen science programs influences conservation engagement. We analysed evaluation surveys of Earthwatch Institute citizen science participants (N = 608) and conducted in-depth interviews (N = 11), to examine the links between citizen science experiences and engagement outcomes. We discovered that while nature-based components of citizen science programs attract participants and create a salient environment for transformation, these are not objectively associated with engagement outcomes. Strengthened awareness was associated with learning, social interactions and cultural experiences, whereas intentions to engage in conservation action was only influenced by experiencing a sense of contribution. Rather than focusing only on learning and nature experiences, our results suggest that the elements of citizen science programs which support social change may require allowing participants to develop a sense of contribution amid an interactive social environment.

abstract={During the Mississippian period, metazoan reefs and other marine faunas gradually recovered from the Late Devonian mass extinctions and reached a peak in the late Visean (~334–332 Ma). Faunal diversity started to decline from the latest Visean (~332–330 Ma) through Serpukhovian (~330–323 Ma), with significant genera/species losses and ecosystem reconstruction. This Middle-Late Mississippian biodiversity crisis (M-LMBC) was thought to have been caused by global cooling associated with the late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA), but existing sedimentological and temperature proxy data suggest that the global cooling event—that marks the onset of the main glaciation phase of LPIA—happened either ~4 Myr before or ~ 1–5 Myr after the initial biodiversity decline at ~332 Ma. Here, we report oxygen isotope data of diagenetically screened, well-preserved brachiopod calcite (δ18Ocalcite) from late Visean-Serpukhovian (or Middle-Late Mississippian; ~334–323 Ma) strata in South China where biodiversity data are well documented. The δ18Ocalcite data reveal a ~ 2.0‰ positive shift from −4.6 ± 0.2‰ to −2.7 ± 0.5‰ with an estimated ~4.7–5.5 °C drop in sea surface temperature (SST) during ~332.5–331.5 Ma in the late Visean. This cooling event coincides with fast decline of metazoan reef abundance, followed by decrease of benthic faunal diversity. The δ18Ocalcite data, in combination with calibrated sedimentological and biodiversity data, demonstrate the coupling between late Visean (~332 Ma) onset of the main glaciation phase of the LPIA and initiation of the M-LMBC. © 2021},

abstract={Invasive species are one of the greatest drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide, and the eradication of invasive species from islands is a highly efficient management strategy. Because eradication operations require large financial investments, uncertainty over the magnitude of impacts of both invasive species and their removal can impede the willingness of decision makers to invest in eradication. Such uncertainty is prevalent for long-lived species that display an inherent lag between life stages affected by invasive species and those used for population status assessments. Albatrosses are amongst the longest-living bird species and are threatened on land by invasive species and at sea by industrial fisheries. As in many seabird species, usually only a segment of the population (breeding adults) is used for status assessments, making it difficult to assess albatross population trends and the potential benefit of conservation action, such as the management of predatory invasive species. We used population monitoring and mark-recapture data to estimate the past population trajectory of the critically endangered Tristan albatross Diomedea dabbenena by accounting for unobservable birds at sea in an integrated population model. We then projected the future population trajectory of Tristan albatrosses for scenarios with or without predation by invasive house mice Mus musculus on their main breeding site, Gough Island. The adult breeding population remained stable between 2004 and 2021, but breeding success was low (31%) and our model indicated that the total population (including unobservable immature birds) decreased from a median estimate of 9,795 to 7,752 birds. Eradicating invasive mice leading to a two-fold increase in breeding success would result in a 1.8–7.6 times higher albatross population by 2050 (median estimate 10,352 individuals) than without this intervention. Low reproductive output for long-lived species may lead to a cryptic population decrease, which can be obscured from readily available counts of breeding pairs by changes in the population structure. Mouse eradication is necessary to halt the ongoing population decrease of the Tristan albatross, even if this decrease is not yet apparent in the breeding population size. © 2022 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Anthropogenic land use changes, such as deforestation and commercial forestry, have substantially reduced natural roost sites for European bats. A common conservation solution is to provide artificial roosts (i.e. bat boxes), but there are concerns that these can become hotter than natural roosts in summer and could be death traps during heat waves. Nevertheless, females of several bat species form maternity colonies in these boxes, thus occupying hotter and more humid microclimates than solitarily roosting males. We tested if cooling efficiency and heat tolerance differ between sexes in European bats, and estimated the evaporative water requirements for bats living in bat boxes during hot summer days. We used indirect calorimetry and thermometry to quantify thermoregulation at high air temperatures (Ta) in four species of verspitilionid bats that regularly occupy artificial roosts. We measured resting metabolic heat production, evaporative water loss rates (EWL) and body temperature (Tb) at Ta between 28°C and 48°C during summer. We predicted that females have higher evaporative cooling efficiency (evaporative heat loss/metabolic heat production) than males, allowing them to reach their heat tolerance limit at higher Ta. We found no sex differences in maximum evaporative cooling efficiency, maximum Tb, and maximum Ta tolerated. However, the patterns of increasing EWL with Ta differed between sexes. Females tolerated higher Ta before increasing EWL than males and then rapidly increased EWL to higher values than males at the maximum Ta tolerated. These sex differences in heat dissipation strategies may reflect varying ecological and physiological constraints associated with different summer roosting habits. Synthesis and applications. Our study revealed that some small European bat species are already at risk of succumbing to lethal dehydration during present-day heat waves, with daytime evaporative water requirements equivalent to ~30% of body mass in sun-exposed boxes. For conservation managers working with common European bat species, particularly those in monoculture forests with woodcrete bat-boxes, our physiologically informed recommendations include positioning boxes in diverse locations varying in aspect and sun exposure. This will ensure thermal heterogeneity of roost sites and provide a wide gradient of microclimate conditions, allowing for roost switching when necessary. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={The Rio Grande Rise (RGR) is a large and geomorphologically complex feature located in the Southwest Atlantic, with great commercial and scientific interest due to its potential for mining rare earth elements that are critical for low-carbon technologies. Brazilian interest in this area led to the submission of a petition to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in 2018 to include RGR on the limits of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. However, mining activities are potentially harmful to deep-sea ecosystems and will likely cause some extent of biodiversity loss. Thus, baseline and continuous environmental studies in the RGR are important to address potential conflicts between mineral extraction and the conservation of deep-sea biodiversity. The RGR is characterized by a series of summit plateaus of ∼600 m deep divided NE-SW by a rift valley, up to 2000 m deep. In 2018, the plateaus and rift of a small area in RGR (30°35′S – 31°03′S, 35°36′W – 36°16′W) were explored through 13 dives of the robotic underwater vehicle (RUV) HyBIS. Videos were analyzed for the description of structuring factors (topography and habitat types) and to record benthic megafauna occurrences. Video transects revealed highly heterogeneous and rapidly changing habitats. Eleven habitats, five in the rift and six in the plateaus are proposed based on geomorphology, slope, and substrate textures. We recorded 17,008 megabenthic organisms classified in 83 morphotypes and six different phyla, from which Porifera (42.7%) and Cnidaria (41.5%) were the most representative. Samples were characterized by a high dominance and the dissimilarities result chiefly from differences in abundance scores. PERMANOVA tests indicated that Habitat and Region variables were the most important to explain structure within the community data, followed by depth and slope. The rift floor exhibited a low abundance of megabenthic epifauna, except in a sinkhole in the northern part of the rift. The lower and upper rift wall were characterized by different communities delimited by the transition between the Antarctic Intermediate Water and the Upper Circumpolar Deep Water. The habitats formed by Fe–Mn deposits were dominated by distinct communities, which were rarely observed elsewhere. Additionally, we found variations in community structure at regional scales (20–30 km), with distinct communities on each side of the rift and at the southwest of the study area. Our results contribute toward understanding the diversity, biogeography, and environmental drivers of the RGR. Fauna distribution is patchy, linked to habitats with potential mining resources, and dominated by Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) indicator taxa. Extensive community analysis should occur at a given site prior to consideration for the exploitation of natural resources. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Rivers are among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide and are experiencing rapid biodiversity loss. Flow alteration due to climate change, water abstraction and augmentation is a severe stressor on many aquatic communities. Macroinvertebrates are widely used for biomonitoring river ecosystems although current taxonomic approaches used to characterise ecological responses to flow have limitations in terms of generalisation across biogeographical regions. A new macroinvertebrate trait-based index, Flow-T, derived from ecological functional information (flow velocity preferences) currently available for almost 500 invertebrate taxa at the European scale is presented. The index was tested using data from rivers spanning different biogeographic and hydro-climatic regions from the UK, Cyprus and Italy. The performance of Flow-T at different spatial scales and its relationship with an established UK flow assessment tool, the Lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE), was assessed to determine the transferability of the approach internationally. Flow-T was strongly correlated with the LIFE index using both presence-absence and abundance weighted data from all study areas (r varying from 0.46 to 0.96). When applied at the river reach scale, Flow-T was effective in identifying communities associated with distinct mesohabitats characterised by their hydraulic characteristics (e.g., pools, riffles, glides). Flow-T can be derived using both presence/absence and abundance data and can be easily adapted to varying taxonomic resolutions. The trait-based approach facilitates research using the entire European invertebrate fauna and can potentially be applied in regions where information on taxa-specific flow velocity preferences is not currently available. The inter-regional and continental scale transferability of Flow-T may help water resource managers gauge the effects of changes in flow regime on instream communities at varying spatial scales. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Tropical rain forest fragmentation is considered one of the principal drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide. Fragmentation and defaunation of tropical rain forests affect the maintenance of their biodiversity in a myriad of ways. Old-growth forest plant and animal species are more likely to suffer from local extinction, not only because fragments frequently represent low quality habitats but also because of the loss of biotic interactions such as seed dispersal. In this study, we evaluated the maintenance of tree species diversity in the face of habitat fragmentation in southern Mexico using different approaches. Firstly, we used community phylogeny at different tree life stages (i.e., seeds, seedlings and adults). Secondly, we categorised plant species in different life stages into functional groups according to seed size (small seeds < 1 cm length and large seeds > 1 cm length) and, finally, by dispersal syndrome (predominantly primate dispersed). We searched for three sites of continuous forest as experimental controls where two important seed dispersers coexist, the howler (Alouatta pigra) and spider (Ateles geoffroyi) monkeys, and six forest fragments of similar sizes (ca. 3–6 ha). Three fragments were occupied only by howler monkeys, and three had no primates. We compared entire assemblages as well as assemblages of small-seeded and large-seeded species separately to determine the phylogenetic structure and patterns of species richness and the density of adult trees (> 10 cm dbh), seedlings (10–100 cm tall) and seed assemblages. Fragments and continuous forest differed in taxonomic species richness and density at all life stages when large-seeded species mainly dispersed by primates were solely considered, with numbers in unoccupied fragments being consistently lower than in continuous forests and occupied fragments. Phylogenetic clustering occurred in all habitats and for all life stages, predominantly for the seedling stage, indicating that the understory community is assembled via environmental filtering (including both biotic and abiotic processes). Habitats occupied by primates tended to present a higher phylogenetic clustering than unoccupied fragments, suggesting that primates select phylogenetically-related species in their diets and, importantly, that these foraging behaviours influence seedling recruitment patterns. The loss of taxonomic and functional biodiversity and the non-random extinction of tree species principally dispersed by primates, represents part of the evolutionary history that is being lost throughout fragmentation. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Aim: Biodiversity loss results in reduced ecosystem functioning. However, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (the BEF relationship) in overexploited ecosystems remains controversial largely because of the lack of validation in nature. Therefore, in this study, through four seasonal trawl surveys of demersal fish assemblages off the shelf sea of Shandong Province, China, we explored BEF relationships and their seasonal variability. Furthermore, we assessed the relative importance of the environment and biodiversity on biomass variations. Location: Shelf sea of Shandong Province, China. Methods: At each station, we calculated taxonomic and functional diversity indices, and examined their association with ecosystem functioning based on the biomass index. Moreover, we examined the biomass index's association with two environmental variables, sea bottom temperature and sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration, to investigate the relative importance of the environmental conditions in explaining changes in ecosystem functioning. Results: Two taxonomic diversity indices (species richness and variance) and two functional diversity indices (functional richness and functional evenness) were significantly associated with biomass in at least one season. However, the BEF relationships were not consistent among the seasons, highlighting the need to consider season-specific biodiversity indices (e.g., functional evenness). Specifically, despite consistently significant BEF relationships in the four seasons for species richness, variance, and functional richness, we noted temporally variable BEF relationships for functional evenness. Both the environment and biodiversity produced a strong synergistic effect on biomass, although their relative importance varied among seasons. Main conclusions: Biodiversity greatly contributes to ecosystem functioning, underscoring the need to assess the consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystems using integrated taxonomic and trait-based approaches. Our findings on season-dependent BEF relationships provide evidence for considering seasonal factors before applying BEF relationships to ecosystem-based management, at least in overexploited shelf sea ecosystems. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Parks are essential for protecting biodiversity and finding ways to improve park effectiveness is an important topic. We contributed to this debate by examining spatial and temporal changes in illegal activities in Kibale National Park, Uganda between 2006 and 2016 and used existing data to evaluate how the changes were correlated with the living conditions of people in neighboring communities, as well as patrolling effort. We explore the effectiveness of conservation strategies implemented in Kibale, by quantifying changes in the abundance of nine animal species over two to five decades. While uncertainty in such animal survey data are inherently large and it is hard to generalize across a 795-km2 area that encompasses diverse habitat types, data suggest an increase in animal abundance in the National Park. An increase in patrolling effort by park guards over the decade was correlated with a decline in the number of traps and snares found, which suggests patrolling helped limit resource extraction from the park. The park’s edge was extensively used for illegal forest product extraction, while the setting of snares occurred more often deeper in the forest. Perhaps counter-intuitively, increased community wealth or park-related employment in a village next to the park were positively correlated with increased illegal forest product extraction. Overall, our results suggest that the portfolio of conservation strategies used over the last two to five decades were effective for protecting the park and its animals, although understanding the impact of these efforts on local human populations and how to mitigate any losses and suffering they sustain remains an important area of research and action. It is evident that complex social, political and economic drivers impact conservation success and more interdisciplinary studies are required to quantify and qualify these dimensions. © 2021 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={Land use change, agricultural and urban expansion, and anthropogenic climate change are the major drivers of biodiversity loss across the globe. Big cats (a casual term including species such as tigers, lions, mountain lions, jaguars, leopards, snow leopards, and cheetahs) are impacted by these global changes. As human settlement and activity increasingly overlap with big cat habitat, the frequency of human conflict over wildlife is rising, often precipitating direct costs to people living near big cats. Big cats are rare, they play many critical roles in the ecosystems they inhabit, and are often flagship conservation species because they are poster-charismatic megafauna. As many of the costs of conservation are borne by locals, local acceptance of big cats on the landscape is fundamental to the success of in-situ conservation of these species. Here, we explore this issue by conducting a systematic literature review of articles that directly measure local perceptions (or acceptance) of big cats quantitatively. We normalized all perception data so we could synthesize results across places and species. The final set of data included the views of 14 253 locals from 45 papers, interrogating five different question types on local perceptions of big cats. Across these studies, we found that locals generally hold neutral or slightly positive perceptions of big cats – particularly for tigers and mountain lions. On average, livestock owners have more negative perceptions of big cats compared to non-livestock owners. Geographically, there are large portions of big cat population ranges where no research on local perceptions exist. These results call for two things (1) rethinking the perception that locals largely hold negative views toward big cats across their ranges and (2) more systematic research across big cat species ranges to better understand local perceptions, what drives those perceptions, and how they impact the outcomes of conservation approaches. © 2021 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={Environmental flows are critical for balancing societal water needs with that of riverine ecosystems; however, data limitations often hinder the development of predictive relationships between anthropogenic modifications to streamflow regimes and ecological responses - these relationships are the basis for setting regional water policy standards for rivers. Herein, we present and describe a comprehensive dataset of modeled hydrologic alteration and consequences for native fish biodiversity, both mapped at the stream-reach resolution for the conterminous U.S. Using empirical observations of reference conditions and anthropogenically altered streamflow at over 7000 stream gauges, we developed a predictive model of hydrologic alteration, which was extended to >2.6 million stream reaches. We then used a previous nationwide assessment of ecological responses to hydrologic alteration to predict fish biodiversity loss in stream reaches resulting from streamflow modification. Validation efforts suggested hydrologic alteration models had satisfactory performance, whereas modeled ecological responses were susceptible to compounded errors. The dataset could ameliorate regional data deficits for setting environmental flow standards while providing tools for prioritizing streamflow protection or restoration. © 2022. The Author(s).},

abstract={The revitalisation of soil fauna in post-mining soils is one of the ways in which we can slow down biodiversity loss. To investigate the effect of a meadow soil transplanted directly into the spoil substrate on the colonisation of a spoil heap, we used nematodes as a tool for an assessment of success in soil fauna recolonisation. Three blocks of meadow topsoil (10 × 3 × 0.4 m) were dug out and transported as intact as possible into a bare substrate of spoil heaps near Sokolov (Czech Republic). The soil samples were taken at the beginning of the experiment (1997) and then, after 19 years (2016), were transported into blocks (B) in their surroundings in a 2 m distance (I) and, finally, 30 m from the transported blocks as a control (C), to compare and assess the complexity of soil food web. Nematode total abundances were highest in B plots and lowest in the nearby I plots at the beginning, whereas later, their abundances were highest in I plots and lowest in the control (C) plots. However, due to the high variability, abundances were statistically insignificant. The trophic composition of I plots became similar to the composition in B plots in the late phase; however, the high occurrence of predators in C plots showed a running succession even after 19 years. Our results together with previous works from the same experiment support the findings that the level of soil development has a larger impact on recolonisation by soil fauna than the migration barrier itself. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Brush pile (katha), a fish aggregating device, has been widely used in the Shari-Goyain River since 2003 to congregate fish for easier catch. Katha is usually used during the winter season when the water depth decreases. Hence, this experiment was conducted from November 2018 to March 2019 on katha fishing to investigate its status and impacts on fisheries resources of the Shari-Goyain River in the Sylhet district of Bangladesh. The study was based on the hypothesis that katha fishing might have detrimental impacts to fish biodiversity and production. Data were obtained through a questionnaire-based survey, personal interviews, catch assessment (CA), focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. A total of 54 species were documented, including two exotic fish species (tilapia and common carp) and 3 species of prawn during harvesting of the kathas. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) (kg/gear/ha/person/hour) was the highest in December (1.13 ± 0.37), followed by November (1.06 ± 0.40), January (0.80 ± 0.25), February (0.71 ± 0.23), and March (0.52 ± 0.21). The catch per unit area (CPUA) (kg/ha) was the highest in November (264.66 ± 18.21), followed by December (205.05 ± 27.77), January (175.02 ± 76.04), February (147.73 ± 52.11), and March (102.08 ± 41.04) where significant differences (p < 0.05) among the months were observed. Average catch per katha in a month ranged from 41.09 ± 16.11 to 12.42 ± 5.89 kg, with a mean of 24.29 ± 11.08 kg, and a significant decrease in average catch was observed with the progression of months. The most species richness was noticed in December (38), followed by November (35), January (34), February (28), and March (25). Siluriformes (39.123%) was the most dominant order, followed by Cypriniformes (33.956%), Decapoda (14.661%), and Ovalentaria (3.278%). According to the CA and respondents’ perception, indiscriminate harvesting of fish by katha fishing can be a cause of fish biodiversity loss as it reduces open water catches, total production, and disturbs the ecosystem. From the research findings, it is suggested that katha fishing should be stopped for sustainable management and conservation of fisheries resources in the Shari-Goyain River. Research on the effects of katha fishing should be conducted in other open waters of Bangladesh where this type of fishing is common. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Biodiversity losses have increased in tropical forests due to fire-related disturbances. As landscape fragmentation and climate change increase, fires will become more frequent and widespread across tropical rain forests worldwide, with important implications for forest dynamics by altering plant–animal interactions. Here we tested the hypothesis that recurrent fires in tropical rain forests change bottom-up and top-down forces controlling the abundance of insect herbivores, which in turn increases herbivory. To quantify herbivory, we collected 50 leaves per tree of five species in burned and unburned experimental plots (N = 75) in southeastern Amazonian forests. We measured leaf nitrogen content and leaf thickness of tree leaves as bottom-up factors that could explain differences in herbivory; we measured predation pressure on model caterpillars and estimated the abundance of predatory ants as top-down factors. We found higher herbivory in burned than in unburned forests, as well as lower predator attacks in caterpillar models and lower abundance of predatory ants. Leaf nitrogen content did not vary across treatments. Birds attacked model caterpillars more frequently in burned than in unburned forests, and leaf thickness was higher in burned forests, but these factors together were not enough to offset the higher herbivory in burned plots. Fire degrades tropical forests not only by killing trees and altering their structure and community dynamics, but also by reducing predatory arthropods and disrupting predator–prey interactions, which triggers increased herbivory. These indirect impacts of recurrent fires probably contribute to further alter forest structure, functioning, and to decrease regeneration in Amazonian forests.

abstract={Existing evidence about climate change in Zimbabwe has tended to focus more on elements and events of the climate system, marginalizing changes in the hydrological and ecological system. To contribute to the improved understanding of climate change, this study captured the observations of climate change in Malipati, a remote agrarian dryland area in the Chiredzi District, Zimbabwe. The aim of the study was to gather detailed insights about perceived environmental changes using the evidence drawn from local and indigenous populations who have close interactions with their natural environment. A household questionnaire-based survey with randomly chosen farmers (n = 116) revealed that participants’ observations of changes in hydrological and ecological system were consistent with available evidence of increasing temperatures and little rainfall recorded in the district. Results also showed high sensitivity of the area to climate change that manifest in various indicators: hydrological changes in rivers, streams, swamps, and ground water; and ecological changes through the behaviour of trees, insects, birds, and wild animals. Sex and age of the participants did not influence the way they perceived most of these changes (p > 0.05). However, education and the period of stay in the area were related to the respondents’ perceived changes in river flows and siltation, and the conditions of swamps (p < 0.05). Our study also revealed deeper insights about the human-biodiversity interactions in the face of climate change in unique areas where communities live alongside wildlife. The evidence drawn from local and indigenous populations can be used to inform local-based solutions to the growing problems of climate change and biodiversity loss. Future studies would need to further examine such areas to understand the mitigation and adaptation practices that would promote the sustainable co-existence of humans and wildlife. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Recent studies carried out by landscape and urban ecologists have shown that habitat fragmentation has negative environmental effects and is accountable for the loss of biodiversity. The development and extension of road infrastructure to support economic growth, the urbanization and the land-use changes are major drivers of habitat fragmentation. Planners have attempted to develop tools for restoring connectivity and stopping biodiversity loss at the landscape scale and which can be applied at the urban scale, too. The study fills in the gap by developing a methodology for identifying the ecological corridors of a Romanian large carnivore (brown bear) in the Romanian Carpathian Mountains at several spatial scales. The methodology relies on geospatial data; this is equally its most important advantage and challenge. Our findings suggest that the implementation of ecological corridors in current planning practice must be completed cautiously, provided the possible restrictions are imposed on economic activities by plans, and highlight the importance of field data in increasing the scientific soundness of the results.

abstract={Landfills led to biodiversity loss and have been identified as one of the major threats to wildlife, such as amphibians. There are useful tools that reflect environmental stress and help to monitor populations health before irreversible population decline occurs. Fluctuating asymmetry and oxidative stress have been used to analyze stress in wildlife. We analyzed the fluctuating asymmetry of morphological traits and the oxidative stress in the toad Rhinella marina that occur in contrasting habitats: a temperate forest and a landfill. We found higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry in toads of the landfill compared to individuals from the forest. Toads from the landfill also had higher levels of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity than toads from the forest, meanwhile lipid peroxidation was similar between toad's populations. Higher fluctuating asymmetry suggests higher environmental stress in toads from the landfill. We highlight that although cane toads have been described as an invasive species of anthropized environments, our findings confirm an increase in the levels of environmental stress in landfills. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Deforestation and habitat fragmentation are known as the chief drivers of biodiversity loss. Less is known about the condition of species and individuals that remain in disturbed habitats. Theory predicts that resources are more limited after compared with before fragment isolation. Thus, we assessed how body condition of individual birds' changes in response to forest fragment isolation. We compared weights of the same individually banded birds caught in mist nets within 5 years before and after fragment isolation and assessed the population-level changes of three species at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project in the Brazilian Amazon. We predicted that fragment isolation would result in reduced weight for all bird species. Out of the 3466 bird mist net captures before and after isolation in the 1980s and the 2150 birds captured before and after re-isolation of fragments in the 2010s, only 73 adult individuals from 36 different species were recaptured, suggesting that few individuals stay in fragments. Contrary to predictions, insectivorous species that remained in fragments gained weight (3.43%) after fragment isolation while frugivorous birds maintained a stable weight. While recent studies report long-term declines in body mass of birds in tropical unfragmented tropical forests, our results provide a novel analysis into how avian body mass responds to habitat fragmentation. Further studies on the body condition of individuals that remain in fragments and the ultimate consequences of fluctuations in body condition are needed to better understand why some individuals and species are more susceptible to forest fragmentation than others.

abstract={The wildlife trade drives biodiversity loss and zoonotic disease emergence, and the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 have sparked discussions over stricter regulation of the wildlife trade. Yet regulation for conservation and health purposes is at odds with the economic incentives provided by this multibillion-dollar industry. To understand why the wildlife trade persists despite associated biodiversity and global health threats, we used a benefit–cost approach using simple calculations to compare the economic benefits of the wildlife trade at the individual, national, and global scales to the costs of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Ebola disease across scenarios of epidemic frequency. For COVID-19, benefits of the wildlife trade outweigh costs at individual scales, but costs far exceed benefits at national and global scales, particularly if epidemics were to become frequent. For SARS and Ebola, benefits outweigh costs at all scales, except if Ebola-like epidemics were to become frequent. The wildlife trade produces net benefits for people who depend on wildlife for food and income but incurs net costs on stakeholders at larger scales from increased epidemic risk. While our analysis omits a variety of costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify and contrast, our analysis is meant to illustrate the distributional outcomes across stakeholder groups that could result from increased wildlife trade regulation. Importantly, the feasibility of trade regulatory policies will depend on how these benefits and costs compare across groups and would therefore need to involve accessible and attractive alternative sources of food and livelihoods for those who depend on the wildlife trade. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Maintaining ecosystem processes within patches of remnant vegetation is critical to minimising biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes. Foundation species—habitat-forming organisms that interact with many other species—are therefore a priority for conservation and restoration in farming areas. Triodia spp. grasses are foundation species of arid and semi-arid Australia that largely depend on fire for recruitment, but fire is suppressed or excluded in many agricultural areas. We tested the effectiveness of controlled burns and competitor removal (exotic and native grasses), both in isolation and combined, on recruitment rates of Triodia scariosa in remnant vegetation using a before-after, control-impact study across 126 plots. A subset of plots were located in an herbivore exclusion area inside a reserve. There was no recruitment of T. scariosa 1 year after burning, regardless of treatment or control, and the burns killed all existing plants. However, T. scariosa germinated by 2 years post-burn, with the greatest recruitment in sites where both burning and grass removal were applied. Two years after burning, T. scariosa abundance (adults and recruits) remained low outside reserves, but returned to original levels in reserves and in areas where large herbivores were excluded. Synthesis and applications. Despite failing to increase overall abundance, we show that restoration of a foundation plant species in degraded, agricultural landscapes can be achieved through a combination of fire reintroduction and competitor suppression. Germination trials from soil samples suggest a depleted seed bank limited recruitment rates, and therefore emphasise the importance of carefully timing restoration actions to overcome recruitment bottlenecks. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Although declines in grassland birds have been documented, national initiatives to conserve grasslands and their biota have fallen short in part because the non-market values of natural ecosystems and species are often not recognized in political decision making. Identifying shared, anthropogenic threats faced by market-valued and non-market-valued species may generate additional support for grassland conservation. We quantify the relationship between the market value of grasslands to commercial beekeepers and the importance of grasslands for birds of conservation concern in North and South Dakota. Our models estimated beekeeping annual revenue increased by $7525 USD and grassland bird abundances increased 2 to 7% per 10-km2 increase in grassland area. We estimated grassland conversion from 2006 to 2012 resulted in a $2.0 to $2.8 M USD decrease in annual revenue for beekeepers in the Dakotas. Through this study we demonstrate both the market value of grasslands to commercial beekeepers and the non-market benefits of grasslands in supporting migratory birds and discuss the implications of future land-use change. As grassland conversion and subsequent biodiversity loss continue, understanding the co-benefits of grassland conservation may be necessary to illuminate their contributions to society. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Appropriate vegetation management in semi-natural grasslands can provide important habitats for grassland species. However, an increasing number of semi-natural grasslands are being abandoned worldwide due to changes in lifestyle and resource use, which has resulted in a drastic decline in grassland-dependent species. Ski pistes can function as important habitats for various grassland flora and fauna, but they have been increasingly closed because of climate change and population decline. However, it remains unclear how the abandonment of pistes affects biodiversity. Here, we examined how butterfly communities change with time since the abandonment of pistes in Japan. We assessed the species richness and abundance of grassland, ruderal, and forest butterflies; vegetation height; and the amount of food resources for larval and adult butterflies on both abandoned and active pistes. We then analyzed the relationships between butterfly species richness and abundance and years since abandonment to explore their potential drivers. The species richness and abundance of grassland and ruderal butterflies were negatively related to years since piste abandonment, whereas those of forest butterflies were highest in pistes abandoned for around 10 years. We also found that butterfly species richness and abundance were largely explained by vegetation height and food resource availability. Our results indicate that the abandonment of pistes likely negatively affects the butterfly communities in these environments. Regular vegetation management could mitigate the biodiversity loss caused by abandonment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={The global biodiversity crisis from anthropogenic activities significantly weakens the functioning of marine ecosystems and jeopardizes their ecosystem services. Increasing monitoring of marine ecosystems is crucial to understand the breadth of the changes in biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and propose more effective conservation strategies. Such strategies should not only focus on maximizing the number of species (i.e., taxonomic diversity) but also the diversity of phylogenetic histories and ecological functions within communities. To support future conservation decisions, multicomponent biodiversity monitoring can be combined with high-throughput species assemblage detection methods such as environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. Here, we used eDNA to assess fish biodiversity along the coast of southern Brittany (France, Iroise Sea). We filtered surface marine water from 17 sampling stations and applied an eDNA metabarcoding approach targeting Actinopterygii and Elasmobranchii taxa. We documented three complementary biodiversity components—taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity—and three diversity facets—richness, divergence and regularity. We identified a north/south contrast with higher diversity for the three facets of the biodiversity components in the northern part of the study area. The northern communities showed higher species richness, stronger phylogenetic overdispersion and lower functional clustering compared to the ones in the southern part, due to the higher diversity of habitats (reefs, rocky shores) and restricted access for fishing. Moreover, we also detected a higher level of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional uniqueness in many offshore stations compared to more coastal ones, with the presence of species typically living at greater depths (> 300 m), which suggests an influence of hydrodynamic structures and currents on eDNA dispersion and hence sample composition. eDNA metabarcoding can, therefore, be used as an efficient sampling method to reveal fine-scale community compositions and in combination with functional and phylogenetic information to document multicomponent biodiversity gradients in coastal marine systems. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Amphibian chytridiomycosis, caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has been recognized as the infectious disease causing the most catastrophic loss of biodiversity known to science, with South America being the most impacted region. We tested whether Bd prevalence is distributed among host taxonomy, ecoregion, conservation status and habitat preference in South America. Here we provide a synthesis on the extent of Bd infection across South America based on 21 648 molecular diagnostic assays, roles of certain species in the epidemiology of Bd and explore its association with the reported amphibian catastrophic declines in the region. We show that Bd is widespread, with a continental prevalence of 23.2%. Its occurrence in the region shows a phylogenetic signal and the probability of infection is determined by ecoregion, preferred habitat and extinction risk hosts' traits. The taxa exhibiting highest Bd occurrence were mostly aquatic amphibians, including Ranidae, Telmatobiidae, Hylodidae, Calyptocephalellidae and Pipidae. Surprisingly, families exhibiting unusually low Bd prevalence included species in which lethal chytridiomycosis and population declines have been described (genera Atelopus, Rhinoderma and Eleutherodactylus). Higher than expected prevalence of Bd occurred mainly in amphibians living in association with mountain environments in the Andes and Atlantic forests, reflecting highly favourable Bd habitats in these areas. Invasive amphibian species (e.g. Lithobates catesbeianus and Xenopus laevis) exhibited high Bd prevalence; thus we suggest using these as sentinels to understand their potential role as reservoirs, vectors or spreaders of Bd that can be subjected to management.

abstract={Amphibians are an exemplary case of the current biodiversity crisis, being among the vertebrates suffering the fastest decline. Population dynamics of amphibians can result from processes acting at different scales. Both the local characteristics of breeding wetlands and the features of the surrounding landscape can strongly affect the temporal dynamics of amphibian populations. European newts are particularly threatened by land-use change and invasive alien species. While it is known that newts are declining across Europe, few studies have performed broad-scale assessments of their decline, either because abundance dynamics are more complex to analyse than presence/absence data or because they require a high sampling effort and long-term monitoring. In this study, we show that long-term distribution data can be combined with demographic models to quantify the decline in abundance of newt species at the regional scale, and to assess the importance of multiple factors in determining abundance dynamics. We performed multiple surveys between 1996 and 2020 and used N-mixture models in a Bayesian framework. We then calculated abundance changes between the first and the last sampling season, which were performed with an average timespan of 13 years across all wetlands. Both Italian crested newts and smooth newts showed large declines, with an average estimated abundance loss between the first and last sampling season of 57% and 63%, respectively. Local characteristics of the wetlands were the main determinants of abundance dynamics: the abundance of both species showed a positive relationship with the area and the permanence of the wetland and a negative relationship with the presence of fish. Additionally, the abundance of Italian crested newts was negatively related to the presence of invasive crayfish. No relationship was detected between abundance and terrestrial habitat availability or connectivity measures. Despite uncertainties in the absolute values of estimated abundance, the striking regional-scale decline of newts is evident. Among the major determinants of population dynamics, fish and crayfish presence increased their prevalence in the study area, while other factors remained more stable. Management actions aimed at eradicating or controlling invasive fish and crayfish might halt abundance loss and even revert this declining trend. The application of N-mixture models to long-term data from representative sites permits the analysis of temporal trends of species at the regional scale even when data come from complex monitoring schemes. We found large declines in abundance of two newt species, suggesting that European newts may be more threatened than previously thought. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Illegal wildlife crime is a global phenomenon, accelerating the ongoing biodiversity crisis. In the Old World, and particularly in Africa, illegal use of poisons to eliminate carnivores is the main driver of the continental vulture crisis. Knowledge about the underlying source and drivers of this threat is lacking for most areas, including Kenya, a global vulture and biodiversity hotspot. An extensive questionnaire survey of over 1300 respondents was run, using a specialized questioning technique and quantitative analytical approaches. Results show that, while pastoralists have a positive attitude towards vultures, over 20% of them use poisons to eliminate predators. Poisoning was largely driven by livestock losses to predators, and by negative attitude towards predators. Poisoning was less prevalent among respondents aware of the Kenya Wildlife Act. Overall, we suggest that a combination of top-down, e.g. legislation, and bottom-up (such as corrals or compensation) along with awareness campaigns may help reduce poisoning on the ground. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={The Yangtze Economic Belt (hereafter, the Belt) is one of the most dynamic regions in China in terms of population growth, economic progress, industrialization, and urbanization. It faces many resource constraints (land, food, energy) and environmental challenges (pollution, biodiversity loss) under rapid population growth and economic development. Interactions between human and natural systems are at the heart of the challenges facing the sustainable development of the Belt. By adopting systematic thinking and the methodology of system dynamics simulation, an integrated system-dynamics-based simulation model for the Belt, named ANEMI_Yangtze, has been developed based on the third version of ANEMI3. The nine sectors of population, economy, land, food, energy, water, carbon, nutrients, and fish are currently included in ANEMI_Yangtze. This paper presents the ANEMI_Yangtze model description, which includes (i) the identification of the cross-sectoral interactions and feedbacks involved in shaping the Belt's system behavior over time; (ii) the identification of the feedbacks within each sector that drive the state variables in that sector; and (iii) the description of a new fish sector and modifications to the population, food, energy, and water sectors, including the underlying theoretical basis for model equations. The validation and robustness tests confirm that the ANEMI_Yangtze model can be used to support scenario development, policy assessment, and decision-making. This study aims to improve the understanding of the complex interactions among coupled human-natural systems in the Belt to provide the foundation for science-based policies for the sustainable development of the Belt. © Copyright:},

abstract={Pesticides notwithstanding their benefits in agriculture pose threats to non-target fauna such as amphibians. This study examined the avoidance responses of tadpoles of the African common toad, Amietophrynus regularis, exposed to Dichlorvos and Paraquat under a non-forced multi-compartmented exposure system (NFS) and estimated the Population Immediate Decline (PID) by integrating avoidance and lethal responses. The NFS was designed to allow the free movement of tadpoles across six compartments in order to elucidate the ability of aquatic organisms to detect and potentially avoid contaminated environments at will. The tadpoles (n=3 per compartment/concentration; 18 per system) were exposed to gradients of Dichlorvos (0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/L) and Paraquat (0, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 mg/L) in quadruplicates with their distribution recorded every 20 mins for 3 h. 48 h acute toxicity tests under forced exposure system (FS) was performed using the same range of concentrations. Acute toxicity (48 h) response in the FS tests was dose dependent with LC50 values of 0.79 mg/L and 6.46 mg/L recorded for Dichlorvos and Paraquat, respectively. The mean percentage distribution of tadpoles recorded for Dichlorvos and Paraquat was about 11% and 0% in the highest concentrations (2.0 and 20.0 mg/L) to 58% and 69% in compartments with no contaminants (control), respectively. PID was primarily driven by avoidance responses rather than mortality. These findings are of conservation interest as it elucidates the potential of both pesticides to impair local distribution of amphibians and cause biodiversity loss. © 2022 The Korean Society of Environmental Health and Toxicology & Korea Society for Environmental Analysis.},

abstract={Dams and diversions are a primary threat to freshwater fish biodiversity, including the loss of species and restructuring of communities, often resulting in taxonomic homogenization (increased similarity) over time. Mitigating these impacts requires a strong scientific understanding of both patterns and drivers of fish diversity. Here, we test whether different components of fish biodiversity have changed in response to major dam construction, and whether these patterns are predictable as a function of key environmental factors in the Gan River Basin, China. The results showed that total and native species alpha diversity have declined from the historical period (pre-dam) to the current period (post-dam). A total of 29 native species are lost, while 6 alien species were gained over time. We found evidence for fish faunal homogenization in the Gan River Basin, with a slight (1%) increase in taxonomic similarity among river basins from the historical period to the current period. Additionally, we revealed significant associations between drainage length, drainage area, and average air temperature, and alpha and beta fish diversity. This study provides new insight into the patterns and drivers of fish biodiversity change in the broader Yangtze River Basin and helps inform management efforts seeking to slow, and even reverse, current trajectories of biodiversity change. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Agricultural commodity production constitutes an important livelihood source for farmers but significantly contributes to tropical deforestation and biodiversity loss. While the socioecological effects of agricultural commodities such as palm oil, cocoa and coffee are well studied, the effects for commodities such as cashew (Anacardium occidentale) have received less attention. Global cultivated area for cashew increased rapidly from 526,250 ha in 1980 to ~5.9 million ha in 2018. India is the world’s second largest cashew producer, with cashew farms often occurring adjacent to remnant forests. To mitigate deforestation for cashew expansion, it is necessary to understand present-day land use policies and management practices that drive this expansion. Through semi-structured interviews (n = 65) and a literature review on agricultural policies in India, we evaluated the role of state-led land use policies in cashew expansion and characterised present-day cashew farming systems in the Sawantwadi-Dodamarg landscape in India. Agricultural subsidies introduced from 1980s to 1990s encouraged cultivar cashew expansion and influenced land use conversion from rice and privately owned forest to cashew. Farmers preferred cultivar cashew as they produced higher yields faster, although they required more agrochemical inputs and were susceptible to pests and wildlife depredation. About 80% of farmers had planted cashew farms by clearing forests in the past 30 years and expressed interest to continue the same. Farmers avoided applying for government-sponsored compensation for crop losses due to wildlife depredation and chose instead to expand cultivar cashew into forested areas. Our study deepens the understanding of how government-led agricultural subsidies drive farmers’ uptake of cashew cultivars, farmers’ cashew management practices, and how these factors drive deforestation in this landscape at the state and farm level. We recommend further research with equitable stakeholder participation in cashew farming systems to devise sound planning for forest conservation and sustainability standards for the cashew industry.

abstract={Assessments of the performance of protected-area (PA) networks for aquatic biodiversity conservation are rare yet essential for successful conservation of species. This is especially crucial in highly biodiverse, developing tropical countries where biodiversity loss is most pronounced. We assessed a PA network in the central Andes of Peru that encompasses parts of the geographical distribution of two endangered, endemic, high-elevation Telmatobius frogs. Sites within and beyond PA boundaries were classified into three different PA types: (a) strict-use (prohibits use by local inhabitants), (b) multi-use (allows some use by local inhabitants), and (c) unprotected (no restrictions). We conducted spatial analysis of species distributions, quantified species abundances and population trends, and measured potential threats and ecological integrity in each PA type. Spatial analysis indicated range contractions of 57.7% (T. macrostomus) and 69.0% (T. brachydactylus). Defaunation rates and species abundances in PAs were similar to those outside PAs. Poaching, livestock, and solid waste were the predominant threats. Analysis of ecological integrity indicated that strict-use sites had greater biotic index and habitat assessment scores compared to multi-use sites. These results suggest that despite benefits of greater ecological integrity in strict-use PAs, protection type has little effect on the conservation of aquatic species by itself. Protected areas are unlikely to be effective without better management of the trade-offs between cultural activities and biodiversity conservation. For PA networks to be of better conservation value for aquatic biodiversity in the developing world, they should be community-oriented and connect high-quality habitats, with their borders defined by catchments. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Cities’ green areas are fragmented patches and are often confined to smaller sizes than the higher built-up proportions. Such small-sized green areas can be essential components of green infrastructure to compensate for biodiversity loss. As a proxy to biodiversity, we studied birds in nine small green area locations of Freiburg and eight area locations in Regensburg in Germany. We investigated the neighboring green networks (distance to the nearest water body and another green area) and landscape metrics (patch abundance and habitat heterogeneity at a 1 km radius) that might benefit and explain bird richness and composition in small green areas. We found that the variations in the observed species richness and composition at the surveyed locations were better explained solely by green networks in Freiburg and by green networks and landscape metrics in Regensburg. In general, it indicates that a small green area could be biodiverse if its spatial distribution considers a nearby water body and other green areas, allowing a higher abundance of similar patches and habitat heterogeneity in the neighborhood. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Biodiversity loss is considered one of the main threats to marine ecosystems. In this framework of biodiversity decline, organisms that provide biogenic habitat play a relevant role by their capacity to structure assemblages and influence ecological processes. The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is considered an ecosystem engineer because it alters local environmental conditions maintaining habitat suitability for other organisms, and enhancing local biodiversity. Although it is widely recognized that mussel beds increase diversity, the drivers shaping these assemblages are poorly explored. We investigate whether mussel size homogenisation shapes the abundance, richness and structure of macrobenthic assemblages associated with mussel beds in two shores of the Galician coast (NW Spain). At each shore, two sites, 10 m apart, were selected and at each site, faunal assemblages were compared between mussel clumps showing shells of various sizes (control), and mussel clumps with closely similar-sized mussels, considered as homogenised. Homogenised clumps showed, in general, higher values in total number of individuals and species than control clumps. Regarding the effect of mussel size homogenisation on the multivariate structure of the assemblages, significant differences between control and homogenised clumps were found in three out of the four sites. Most relevant associated species usually reached higher abundances in homogenised clumps than control ones. Therefore, mussel size homogenisation influenced the structure of the macrofaunal assemblages associated with mussel beds but, its effect was context dependent (i.e., varied with sites). Information about the species contribution to dissimilarities among homogenised and control clumps was provided and the potential influence of sediment and algae on mussel clumps was discussed. © 2022 Veiga et al.

abstract={The illegal wildlife trade is resulting in worldwide biodiversity loss and species’ extinction. It should be exposed so that the problems of conservation caused by it can be highlighted and resolutions can be found. Social media is an effective method of information dissemination, providing a real-time, low-cost, and convenient platform for the public to release opinions on wildlife protection. This paper aims to explore the usage of social media in understanding public opinions toward conservation events, and illegal rhino trade is an example. This paper provides a framework for analyzing rhino protection issues by using Twitter. A total of 83,479 useful tweets and 33,336 pieces of users’ information were finally restored in our database after filtering out irrelevant tweets. With 2422 records of trade cases, this study builds up a rhino trade network based on social media data. The research shows important findings: (1) Tweeting behaviors are somewhat affected by the information of traditional mass media. (2) In general, countries and regions with strong negative sentiment tend to have high volume of rhino trade cases, but not all. (3) Social celebrities’ participation in activities arouses wide public concern, but the influence does not last for more than a month. NGOs, GOs, media, and individual enterprises are dominant in the dissemination of information about rhino trade. This study contributes in the following ways: First, this paper conducts research on public opinions toward wildlife conservation using natural language processing technique. Second, this paper offers advice to governments and conservationist organizations, helping them utilize social media for protecting wildlife. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={The aim of this study was to analyse the sustainability of pig production based on a diet containing yeast as a protein source. The yeast is produced from sugar, and the sugar can be produced from hydrolysed wood through a biorefinery process. This study included yeast from two different biorefinery processes: 1) a domestic demo plant in connection with a complex biorefinery, and 2) a small-scale wood refinery process largely based on wood residues. In the yeast diets, the yeast replaced soybean meal as a protein source and the two yeast diets were compared with a standard diet. The environmental impacts from the pig production systems were assessed by using life cycle assessment (LCA), and the functional unit was 1 kg carcass weight of pork at the farm gate. The results from the study show that yeast replacing imported feed protein sources used in pig production gives a lower impact for biodiversity loss and climate change including land use change. The lower impact was created by the replacement of soybean meal with yeast from wood sugar in the feed recipe. Also, the scenarios with yeast diets gave a land use ratio below 1, indicating an improved land use efficiency regarding producing human digestible protein. Even though the forest land used for deriving wood sugar constitutes a greater area than the corresponding area for soybean meal production, the forest land does not occupy areas suitable for food production. The reference case, representing current pig production and feeding system, had a land use ratio of 1.15, meaning that the feed production was directly competing for the area suitable for food production. The overall conclusion was that the utilisation of yeast from wood sugar appears to avoid feed-food competition and at the same time to be an environmentally sustainable solution for future feed protein employed in pig production. © 2022},

abstract={Freshwater fish biodiversity loss in the Mediterranean Basin is regarded as among the highest globally, with long-term population data sets required to discern long-term population trends of threatened species, in order to design appropriate conservation interventions. In this study, we assessed the population trends of two threatened freshwater fishes, Valencia letourneuxi and Valencia robertae, employing the most recent and largest compiled database to date (16 populations over 14 years). We applied the innovative methodology of the Living Planet Index (LPI) to assess the average rate of change over time across a set of V. letourneuxi and V. robertae populations in Greece. The LPI application revealed a dramatic decline of both species, with V. letourneuxi declining by 97.7% and V. robertae by 91.0%. Beta regression showed that water pollution, eutrophication and alien Eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki’ presence were the three best fitting predictors of the decline of V. letourneuxi and V. robertae populations. Based on the above, we outline the conservation measures urgently required to revert the near collapse of the populations of the two species. Conservation actions include the strict protection of the their lowland spring habitats, habitat improvement through changes in water management and agricultural practices, mosquitofish invasion prevention and mosquitofish impact mitigation measures, as well as translocation actions and captive breeding. Lastly, the association patterns of the proposed conservation actions with anthropogenic pressures and their expected outcomes were analysed through an alluvial diagram, providing insights on the scale of pressures mitigated by conservation actions and on their conservation benefits. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Aim: Amphibians, with over 40% of assessed species listed as threatened, are disproportionately at risk in the global extinction crisis. Among the many factors implicated in the ongoing loss of amphibian biodiversity are climate change and the disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). These threats are of particular concern in Australia, where Bd has been implicated in the declines of at least 43 frog species, and climate change is emerging as an additional threat. We explore how climate change is likely to affect the distributions of Australian frog species and Bd to the year 2100, and how the spatial and climatic niche overlap between chytridiomycosis-declined frogs and Bd could shift. Location: Australia. Methods: We used species distribution modelling to infer the current and future distribution of 141 Australian frog species and Bd, under two emissions scenarios. We used various metrics of niche similarity to quantify predicted alterations to spatial interactions between Bd and frog species. Results: Climate change is likely to have a variable impact on frog distributions in Australia, with some 23 and 47 species, primarily in southern Australia, predicted to lose at least 30% of their current distributions under low and high emissions scenarios, respectively. In contrast, 69 and 68 species, respectively, have potential to increase their distributions, primarily in northern Australia. While the distribution of Bd is predicted to decrease, the proportional spatial and niche overlap between Bd and susceptible frog species is predicted to remain little changed, and in some cases, to increase. Main conclusions: Although effects will be variable across the continent, climate change is likely to be a threatening factor to many Australian frog species. Additionally, chytridiomycosis is likely to remain a significant threat to many frog species, as any reductions to the pathogen's distribution largely coincide with geographic range contractions of chytridiomycosis-susceptible species. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={With the continuing biodiversity crisis in New Zealand, an increasing number of eco-sanctuaries have been established to restore local ecology through the active management of invasive predator species, in combination with the translocation of endangered endemic wildlife. Seeking to achieve the (near) complete restoration of pre-human ecosystems, many of these projects are community-led social enterprises where tourism is developed for operation revenue and conservation advocacy. This paper explores perceptions of ecological restoration and tourism by individuals involved in the management and operation at New Zealand mainland eco-sanctuaries and considers implications for the co-creation of visitor experiences. Informed by theories of environmental philosophy, it presents an analysis of 14 in-depth interviews. The findings reveal that the philosophies of the participants can either challenge visitors to reflect upon their ecological perspectives or pay increased attention to visitor interests and accommodate diverse perspectives in the provision of the tourist experience. This paper contributes new knowledge by identifying participants’ eco-centric and shallow anthropocentric environmental ethics and dilemmas facing tourism development at community-led ecological restoration sites. In doing so, it considers the possibility that co-created visitor experiences at eco-sanctuaries can challenge the environmental philosophies of visitors. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Global efforts to halt biodiversity loss mandate the establishment of protected areas. In the face of habitat loss and climate uncertainty, large-scale networks of protected areas connected by corridors are needed to increase the dispersal and persistence potential of biota. For example, the recent European Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 defines clear targets for identifying, establishing and integrating ecological corridors, as part of a Trans-European Nature Network. Here, we examined whether rivers could serve as such corridors, facilitating landscape connectivity (i.e. extent to which landscape facilitates or impedes species movement, exchange of genes, natal dispersal and metapopulation dynamics) among protected areas hosted within different countries in the Balkan Peninsula, southeastern Europe. To quantitatively address this question, we calculated the proportion of the river network enclosed within a protected area per country to detect patterns of protection coverage and explored the degree to which spatial connections between 1878 protected areas are supported by the river network. Acknowledging that dams hinder instream continuity, we further quantified potential loss of connections between protected areas caused by the existence of already implemented or planned dam projects upon critical river habitats of endangered fish species. Our results highlight that Balkan rivers have great potential in providing the spatial connections needed to establish landscape connectivity between most of protected areas in the region. Still, heedless hydropower growth and dissimilarities in river protection between neighboring countries remain key challenges for the evolution of a relative framework. Transnational cooperation and systematic planning of infrastructure development could be the only efficient steps towards supporting the establishment of a river-based network to reconstruct connectivity between protected areas and meet biodiversity goals. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Global biodiversity is in decline due to factors such as land-use change, pollution, and climate change. Birds contribute to biodiversity in several ways; one way, in particular, is by cultivating public support for habitat conservation by being a socially desirable category of wildlife. To understand the social value of bird conservation on private forest lands in Pennsylvania, a statewide web survey was used containing psychometric scales and choice experiment questions (n = 690). The data collected was used to identify important attitudinal positions and estimate statewide demand for bird conservation programs on private lands under different policy options. Mean household WTP was estimated to be $11.83 annually, and statewide demand was estimated to exceed $47 million annually. Nonuse and cultural values underpinned much of the utility associated with the proposed habitat conservation programs. Findings suggest investment in both public education and bird conservation on private lands is a legitimate strategy for mitigating biodiversity loss and enhancing social welfare. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={An underestimated factor that contributes to the decline of insects observed during the last year is probably the mortality, which is caused by mowing of grassland. We studied the negative impact of mowing on the arthropod fauna of roadside grassland, which might serve as potential habitat for insects to prevent their local extinction and as corridor for the dispersal in anthropogenic landscapes. In addition, we studied if losses due to mowing can be mitigated by the use of ‘arthropod-friendly’ mowing technique. In agreement with earlier studies, we found that mowing with a conventional mowing head (MK 1200 from MULAG) caused considerable losses in arthropods, ranging from 29% for Heteroptera over around 50% in Araneae, Cicadina, Hymenoptera and Diptera, up to 73% for holometabolous larvae, and 87% for Lepidoptera. These losses by mowing were fully offset for Araneae, Cicadina, Heteroptera, Lepidoptera and larvae of holometabolous insects when using the mowing head Eco 1200 from MULAG, which was designed to be ‘arthropod-friendly’. For Hymenoptera and Diptera, the losses were reduced by 15% and 25% respectively. For Saltatoria and Coleoptera, we did not find any significant differences between all treatments. These data demonstrate that mowing of roadsides with conventional mowing technology has a highly detrimental effect on the grassland arthropod fauna. However, this effect can be offset or at least mitigated by the use of ‘arthropod-friendly’ mowing technique. Therefore, this technique has a high potential to reduce insect decline in roadside grassland, making these areas a habitat for insects. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Invasive species are a primary threat to biodiversity and are challenging to manage once populations become established in previously unoccupied areas. But removing them is further complicated when invasions occur in continental, mixed-ownership systems. We demonstrate a rare conservation success: the regional-scale removal of an invasive predator – the barred owl (Strix varia) – to benefit the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) in California. Barred owl site occupancy declined sixfold, from 0.19 to 0.03, following 1 year of removals, and site extinction (0.92) far exceeded colonization (0.02). Spotted owls recolonized 56% of formerly occupied territories within 1 year, contrasting starkly with removals conducted after barred owls achieved high densities in the Pacific Northwest. Our study therefore averted the otherwise likely extirpation of California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) by barred owl competition. Collectively, leveraging technological advances in population monitoring, early intervention, targeting defensible biogeographic areas, and fostering public–private partnerships will reduce invasive species-driven extinction of native fauna in continental systems. © 2022 The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Biodiversity loss is driven by human behavior, but there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of behavior-change programs in delivering benefits to biodiversity. To demonstrate their value, the biodiversity benefits and cost-effectiveness of behavior changes that directly or indirectly affect biodiversity need to be quantified. We adapted a structured decision-making prioritization tool to determine the potential biodiversity benefits of behavior changes. As a case study, we examined two hypothetical behavior-change programs––wildlife gardening and cat containment––by asking experts to consider the behaviors associated with these programs that directly and indirectly affect biodiversity. We assessed benefits to southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) and superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus) by eliciting from experts estimates of the probability of each species persisting in the landscape given a range of behavior-change scenarios in which uptake of the behaviors varied. We then compared these estimates to a business-as-usual scenario to determine the relative biodiversity benefit and cost-effectiveness of each scenario. Experts projected that the behavior-change programs would benefit biodiversity and that benefits would rise with increasing uptake of the target behaviors. Biodiversity benefits were also predicted to accrue through indirect behaviors, although experts disagreed about the magnitude of additional benefit provided. Scenarios that combined the two behavior-change programs were estimated to provide the greatest benefits to species and be most cost-effective. Our method could be used in other contexts and potentially at different scales and advances the use of prioritization tools to guide conservation behavior-change programs. © 2021 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Estuaries––one of the most vulnerable ecosystems globally––face anthropogenic threats, including biodiversity loss and the collapse of sustainable fisheries. Determining the factors contributing to the maintenance of estuarine biodiversity, especially that of fish, is vital for promoting estuarine conservation and sustainability. We used environmental DNA metabarcoding analysis to determine fish species composition in 22 estuaries around Japan and measured watershed-scale land-use factors (e.g., population size, urban area percentage, and forest area percentage). We sought to test the hypothesis that the richness of the most vulnerable estuarine fish species (i.e., registered by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment in the national species red-list) is determined by watershed-scale land-use factors. The richness of such species was greater, where forest cover was highest; thus, forest cover contributes to their conservation. The proportion of agriculture cover was associated with low species richness of red-listed fishes (redundancy analysis, adjusted R2 = 43.9% of total variance, df = 5, F = 5.3843, p = 0.0001). The number of red-listed species increased from 3 to 11 along a watershed land-use gradient ranging from a high proportion of agriculture cover to a large proportion of forest cover. Furthermore, the results showed that throughout Japan all the examined watersheds that were covered by &gt;74.8% forest had more than the average (6.7 species per site) richness of red-listed fish species. This result can be attributed to the already high average forest cover in Japan of 67.2%. Our results demonstrate how the land use of watersheds can affect the coastal sea environment and its biodiversity and suggest that proper forest management in conjunction with land-use management may be of prime importance for threatened fish species and coastal ecosystems in general. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Global biodiversity loss has increased interest in identifying the patterns and mechanisms that shape community assembly. Growing empirical evidence indicates that investigating functional and phylogenetic diversity beyond purely taxonomic considerations may provide different but complementary information about community assembly. However, such multifaceted studies on community assembly from both functional and phylogenetic perspectives are rare in the context of fish assemblages in lakes. We examined patterns of functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity in fishes and explored the relationships between these patterns and their environmental drivers across broad environmental gradients in 30 shallow lakes. Furthermore, we examined community assembly mechanisms using null models to quantify the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic assembly processes. Our results revealed no clear patterns among multiple biodiversity components and their environmental drivers, and no single component could be used as a reliable proxy for another; these results suggest that accounting for functional and phylogenetic diversity can help to explain fish community variation. Null models revealed that both deterministic and stochastic assembly processes occurred simultaneously, with stochastic processes being responsible for the majority of fish community assembly processes in most of our study lakes. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of evaluating both functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity when identifying patterns of community assembly. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Land-use change is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Large-scale disturbances such as habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation are known to have negative consequences for native biota, but the effects of small-scale disturbances such as selective logging are less well known. We compared three sites with different regimes of selective logging performed by Indigenous communities in the South American temperate rainforest, to assess effects on the density and habitat selection patterns of the Near Threatened endemic arboreal marsupial Dromiciops gliroides. We used structured interviews to identify patterns of wood extraction, which was 0.22-2.55 m3 per ha per year. In the less disturbed site only two tree species were logged, in the intermediately disturbed sites eight species were logged at low intensity, and in the most disturbed site seven species were logged intensively. The site with intermediate disturbance had the highest fleshy-fruited plant diversity and fruit biomass values as a result of the proliferation of shade-intolerant plants. This site also had the highest density of D. gliroides. These findings are consistent with Connell's intermediate disturbance hypothesis, suggesting that coexistence of people with nature is possible if wood extraction volumes are moderate, increasing plant diversity. Indigenous communities have sustainably used natural resources for centuries, but current rates of land-use change are becoming a significant threat to both them and their natural resources.

abstract={Anthropogenic disturbances are one of the primary factors that drive biodiversity loss. Temporal changes in biodiversity respond to such disturbances. In the present study, we investigated the temporal changes in taxonomic and functional diversity of fish assemblages in different habitats (Three Gorges Reservoir, TGR; running water above the TGR, UTGR; and tributary Chishui River, CSR) in the upper Yangtze basin after impoundment of the TGR from 2008 to 2015. During the survey, the taxonomic and functional composition of fish assemblages varied among the habitats. Although taxonomic diversity increased and functional diversity decreased significantly in the entire upper Yangtze basin, no significant changes in the diversities were observed in each habitat. The habitats showed directional changes in the composition of fish species. The slope of the directional changes in the TGR was more than that in the UTGR and CSR. These results indicated that the distribution of fish species was associated with the habitat after the impoundment. The assembly of the fish assemblage was driven primarily by the neutral process in the entire survey area but was promoted by a combination of species sorting and neutral process in each habitat. The impoundment caused more effects on the TGR than on the UTGR, but it slightly affected the CSR. Regarding fishing closure, conservation measures for fish diversity should be established according to the different habitats. The study findings suggest the removal of small dams in tributaries and ecological regulation in the mainstream and continuous monitoring of fish biodiversity.

abstract={Turtles are one of the most threatened groups of vertebrates, with about 60% of species classified at some level of extinction risk. Compounding this extinction crisis are cryptic species and species complexes that are evaluated under a single species epithet but harbor multiple species, each of which needs to be evaluated independently. The Phrynops geoffroanus species group is a classic example. Described first in 1812, it is currently thought to harbor multiple species. To test this hypothesis, we collected mitochondrial and nuclear genomic data, morphometric data, and distribution and associated biome information. We applied statistically rigorous species delimitation analyses, taxonomic hypotheses tests, and fully coalescent phylogenetic reconstruction methods, concluding that the Phrynops geoffroanus species complex comprises four geographically structured species/lineages that diverged during the Pleistocene and are currently geographically structured along the main South American river basins and biomes. These species/lineages show subtle and largely non-significant differences in shape but are characterized by differences in coloration and patterns of marks on the head and plastron. Our results contribute to the understanding of species diversity and diversification of biodiversity in South America and provide an important basis for the conservation of freshwater turtles. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Wildlife trade is a major driver of biodiversity loss worldwide. To regulate its impact, laws and regulations have been implemented at the international and national scales. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has regulated the international legal trade since 1975. However, an important volume of illegal trade—mainly within countries—continues to threaten several vertebrate groups, which could be due to a lack of specific legislation or enforcement of existing regulations. Our aim was to gain a more accurate picture of poaching and legal possession of native parrots as pets in the Neotropics, where illegal domestic trade is currently widespread. We conducted a systematic search of the laws of each of the 50 countries and overseas territories, taking into account their year of implementation and whether the capture, possession and/or sale of parrots is permitted. We compared this information with legal exports reported by CITES to assess differences between the enforcement of international and national trade regulations. We found that only two countries (Guyana and Suriname) currently allow the capture, trade and possession of native parrots, while Peru allowed international legal trade until recently. The other countries have banned parrot trade from years to decades ago. However, the timing of implementation of international and national trade regulations varied greatly between countries, with half of them continuing to export parrots legally years or decades after banning domestic trade. The confusion created by this complex legal system may have hindered the adoption of conservation measures, allowing poaching, keeping and trade of protected species within and between neighboring countries. Most countries legally exported Neotropical parrot species which were not native to those countries, indicating that trans-border smuggling often occurred between neighboring countries prior to their legal exportations, and that this illicit activity continues for the domestic trade. Governments are urged to effectively implement current legislation that prohibits the trapping and domestic trade of native parrots, but also to develop coordinated alliances and efforts to halt illegal trade among them. Otherwise, illegal trade will continue to erode the already threatened populations of a large number of parrot species across the Neotropics. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Climate change and human activities have caused dramatic impacts on biodiversity. Although a number of international agreements or initiatives have been launched to mitigate the biodiversity loss, the erosion of terrestrial biome habitats is inevitable. Consequently, the identifica-tion of potential suitable habitats under climate change and human disturbance has become an urgent task of biodiversity conservation. In this study, we used the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to identify the current and potential future habitats of Asian elephants in South and Southeast Asia. We performed analyses for future projections with 17 scenarios using the present results as baseline. To optimize the modelling results, we delineated the core habitats by using the Core Mapper Tool and compared them with existing protected areas (PAs) through gap analysis. The results showed that the current total area of core habitats is 491,455 km2 in size and will be reduced to 332,544 km2 by 2090 under SSP585 (the shared socioeconomic pathway). The projection analysis under differential scenarios suggested that most of the core habitats in the current protected areas would remain stable and suitable for elephants in the future. However, the remaining 75.17% of the core habitats lay outside the current PAs, and finally we mapped approximately 219,545 km2 of suitable habitats as priority protected areas in the future. Although our model did not perform well in some regions, our analyses and findings still could provide useful references to the planning of protected areas and conservation of Asian elephant. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Extensive ecosystem degradation and increasing urbanization are altering human relationships with nature. To explore these trends, we created a transdisciplinary, narrative-led podcast series produced by the BBC, called Forest 404. The series explored the implications of a world without nature. An online experimental component mobilized audience participation (n = 7,596) to assess responses to natural soundscapes with and without abiotic, biotic, and poetic elements across five biomes. Conditions featuring the sounds of wildlife, such as bird song, were perceived to be more psychologically restorative than those without. Participants’ personal lived experiences were strongly related to these outcomes; those who had memories triggered by the sounds were more likely to find them psychologically restorative and exhibited a greater motivation to preserve them. Moreover, the effects of both soundscape composition and memories on preservation behavior were partially mediated by restorative potential; respondents were more likely to want to protect the sounds they heard if they thought they might offer therapeutic outcomes.

abstract={Natural wetlands are at the cutting edge of protection concerns, as they harbor a greater range of waterbird assemblages than artificial wetlands. However, more than 50.0% of natural wetland areas and more than 17.0% of waterbird species have become imperiled due to human activities over the last two decades. Thus, it is important to understand whether artificial wetlands play significant roles as alternative habitats for wetland birds. The distance sampling point count method was employed to ascertain the difference in waterbird assemblages inhabiting Lungh natural wetland and Raja artificial wetland in Sindh Province, Pakistan from September 2017 to February 2019. Natural wetlands harbored 39,282 individuals representing 40 waterbird species and 14 families, while artificial wetlands hosted 23,122 individuals representing 39 species and 13 families. In total, 37 species were identified as least concern, 3 were near threatened, and one species was endangered, one vulnerable, and one data deficient. Anas crecca (4.95%) and A. platyrhynchos (4.72%) were the foremost abundant species in natural wetlands. A. crecca (4.57%) and A. clypeata (3.95%) were the foremost prevailing species of artificial wetlands. Alcedo atthis, Charadrius leschenaultia, and Vanellus leucurus did not utilize natural wetlands, while Bubulcus ibis, Larus genei, Tringa brevipes, and Plegadis falcinellus avoided artificial wetlands. The relative abundance of waterbirds between natural and artificial wetlands varied considerably (F1, 85 = 6.26, p &lt; 0.05). Diversity indices indicated that natural wetlands attracted a greater diversity of waterbirds than artificial wetlands. The results indicated that natural wetlands had attracted a larger number of migrating birds than artificial wetlands. In contrast, artificial wetlands harbored a wide range of resident waterbird species than natural wetlands. As a result, we accept the hypothesis that artificial wetlands may serve as an alternative habitat for a wide range of waterbird communities. Hence, it is strongly recommended that artificial wetlands be constructed to harbor a wider array of waterbird species to halt wetland habitats and biodiversity loss across the country. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Freshwater ecosystems are facing a deepening biodiversity crisis. Developing robust indicators to assess ecological integrity across large spatial scales and identifying the specific threats and pathways of impairment are thus critically needed if we are to inform freshwater conservation strategies. Here we present the first comprehensive threat assessment across the Colorado River Basin – one of the largest and most endangered river basins in North America – using a spatial framework accounting for the wide range of human activities (land uses, transportation infrastructure, exploitative activities, water withdrawals), pathways (local footprint, overland runoff, upstream cumulative effects), and spatial extent of influence (valley bottom, catchment and river network) known to affect the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems. We quantified and mapped 69 individual threat indices with geospatial tools for each permanent, ephemeral, and intermittent stream segment within the Basin, encompassing a total of >1,067,700 river kilometers. We further aggregated these indices into components of water quality (diffuse and point-source pollution), hydrology (flow regulation/uses and climate change), and physical system (connectivity and geomorphology). To demonstrate the potential of our framework to inform spatial planning decision processes, we examined the typical combinations of threats experienced by different hydrologic areas and stream segment types, identified candidate watersheds for habitat restoration and enhancement where hotspots of biodiversity and threat overlapped, and assessed the associations between threat indices and in situ measurements of ecological integrity describing a suite of biological (benthic macroinvertebrate, fish), chemical (total nitrogen load, water conductivity), hydrological (flow alteration) and physical indicators (streambed stability, instream habitat complexity). Our assessment highlights clear disparities in term of overall degree of threat that result from different combinations and contributions of individual stressors, with different priorities emerging for perennial versus intermittent or ephemeral stream segments, and between the upper and lower parts of the Basin. Importantly, we showed that our threat indices were generally correlated with biological, chemical, hydrological and physical indicators of ecological integrity they were intended to capture. In addition to its implications for the conservation and management of the highly imperiled Colorado River Basin, our case study illustrates how multi-faceted threat mapping can be used to assess the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems in the absence of spatially extensive in situ measurements. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Urban foresters are addressing the challenge of urban biodiversity loss through management plans in the context of rapid urbanization. Protecting the integrity of the urban ecosystem requires long-term monitoring and planning for resilience as well as effective management. The soundscape assessment has attracted attention in this field, but applying the soundscape assessment in urban ecological monitoring requires a protocol that links soundscapes to the impact of resource management on biodiversity over time. The effective processing and visualization of large-scale data also remains an important challenge. The aim of this study was to better understand the relationship between soundscape and physical environment, and examine the feasibility of this innovative soundscape approach in highly urbanized areas. Soundscape recordings were collected for 20 urban parks twice on 4 consecutive days in Spring. A total of 691,200 min of sound material were automatically obtained. In order to track the spatio-temporal patterns of a soundscape and determine its potential suitability for ecosystem monitoring, our study characterized soundscape information by adopting 4 widely used acoustic indices: acoustic diversity index (ADI), bioacoustic index (BIO), normalized difference vegetation index (NDSI), and power spectral density (PSD). Daily patterns of PSD have provided a potential connection between soundscapes and bird songs, and 1–2 kHz presented a similar pattern that was linked to human activity. Through further modeling, we tested the relationship of soundscapes to physical environment characteristics. The results showed the importance of habitat vegetation structure for acoustic diversity. More vertical heterogeneity, with an uneven canopy height or multilayered vegetation, was associated with more acoustic diversity. This suggests that clearing ground cover may have a significant negative impact on wildlife. Our results suggest that soundscape approaches provide a way to quickly synthesize large-scale recording data into meaningful patterns that can track changes in bird songs and ecosystem conditions. The proposed approach would enable regular assessment of urban parks and forests to inform adaptive planning and management strategies that can maintain or enhance biodiversity. © 2022},

abstract={Tropical peat swamp forests retain large carbon stocks and support unique biodiversity, but clearance and drainage for agriculture have resulted in fires, carbon emissions and biodiversity losses. Initiatives to re-wet cultivated peatlands may benefit biodiversity if this protects remaining forests from fire and agricultural encroachment, but there are concerns that re-wetting could reduce yields and damage livelihoods, as relationships between drainage, on-farm biodiversity, and crop yields have not been studied. We examined oil palm fruit yields and bird diversity on 41 smallholder farms in Jambi (Sumatra, Indonesia), which varied in drainage intensity (12-month mean water table per plot from August 2018 to August 2019: −52 to −3 cm below-ground). We also compared farm bird diversity with a neighbouring area of protected peat swamp forest (11,000 ha, 21 plots; mean water table per plot −3 to +15 cm). Bird species richness (3–18 species per plot), species composition and oil palm yields (4.5–19.2 t fresh fruit bunch ha−1 year−1) varied among farms, but were not detectably affected by water table depth, although ground-level vegetation was more complex on wetter farms. Bird richness in oil palm (mean = 10.3 species per plot) was &lt;50% of that in forest (26 species per plot), and only 3 of 35 conservation-priority species found in forest were recorded in oil palm. Synthesis and applications. Tropical peatlands in Indonesia have been drained to allow farmer access and improve farm yields, but we found no trade-offs between drainage depth, yields and bird diversity on smallholder oil palm farms in our study landscape within the studied range of drainage depths. Current restoration initiatives to re-wet peat may benefit farmers by reducing fire risk, without affecting yields. Wetter farms had increased understorey vegetation complexity, but this did not affect bird diversity, so we find no evidence that re-wetting improves on-farm biodiversity. However, on-farm fire reduction efforts in cultivated peatlands, including re-wetting, will be vital for reducing the risk of fires escaping into nearby forests, which contain unique and diverse bird species assemblages. Protection of remaining peatland forests from fire and clearance is key for biodiversity conservation, and for providing a source of seed dispersers and genetic material for future forest and landscape restoration efforts. Restoration of more biodiversity-friendly land covers will improve landscape permeability and help conserve species and the ecosystem services they deliver. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={The pet trade is a major driver of both biodiversity loss and the introduction of invasive alien species. Building a comprehensive understanding of the pet trade would improve prediction of conservation and biosecurity threats, with the aim to prevent further negative impacts. We used South Australia’s native wildlife permit reporting system as a data-rich example of a vertebrate pet market, spanning 590 distinct taxa across 105 families of terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, reptiles, birds and amphibians). Using a piecewise structural equation modelling (SEM) approach, we tested the influence of 11 a priori variables relating to pets (e.g. species traits), pet owners (e.g. socioeconomic metrics) and regulatory systems (e.g. permit requirements) on the quantities of captive pet keeping, breeding, trading and escapes into the wild. Birds and reptiles with higher annual fecundity were more likely to be kept in captivity and birds with larger adult mass were more likely to be sold. Species with more stringent permit requirements were possessed and escaped, in lower abundances. Pet keeping was weakly correlated with regions of lower human population densities and higher unemployment rates, yet all socioeconomic variables were ultimately poor at explaining trade dynamics. More escapes occurred in regions that possessed larger quantities of pets, further emphasising the role of propagule pressure in the risk of pet escapes. Synthesis and applications. Species traits are a strong determinant of native pet trade dynamics, yet permit systems also play a key role in de-incentivising undesirable trade practices. While our research highlighted the positive potential of trade regulatory systems, we recommend that consistent permit category criteria are established to reduce trade in threatened species as well as invasive alien species of high biosecurity risk. Implementation of such systems is broadly needed across a greater diversity of wildlife markets and jurisdictions. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Unravelling how biodiversity is maintained despite species competition for shared resources has been a central question in community ecology, and is gaining relevance amidst the current biodiversity crisis. Yet, we have still a poor understanding of the mechanisms that regulate species coexistence and shape the structure of assemblages in highly competitive environments such as carrion pulsed resources. Here, we study how large vertebrates coexist in scavenger assemblages by adapting their diel activity at large ungulate carcasses in NW Spain. We used camera traps to record vertebrate scavengers consuming 34 carcasses of livestock and hunted wild ungulates, which allowed us to assess also differences regarding carcass origin. To evaluate temporal resource partition among species, we estimated the overlap of diel activity patterns and the mean times of each scavenger at carcasses. We recorded 16 species of scavengers, 7 mammals and 9 birds, and found similar richness at both types of carcasses. Birds and mammals showed contrasting diel activity patterns, with birds using carcasses during daytime (mean= 11:38 h) and mammals mostly at night (23:09 h). The unimodal activity patterns of scavengers showed asynchronous peaks among species. Subordinate species modified their activity patterns at carcasses used by apex species to reduce temporal overlap. Also, diel activity patterns of vultures closely followed those of corvids, suggesting facilitation processes in which corvids would enhance carcass detection by vultures. Two mammal species (12.5%) increased nocturnality at carcasses of hunted ungulates, which could be a response to human disturbance. Our results suggest that both temporal segregation and coupling mediate the coexistence of large vertebrates at carcasses. These mechanisms might lead to richer scavenger assemblages and thereby more efficient ones in driving critical ecosystem functions related to carrion consumption, such as energy and nutrient recycling and biodiversity maintenance. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={The current perception that climate change is the principal threat to biodiversity is at best premature. Although highly relevant, it detracts focus and effort from the primary threats: habitat destruction and overexploitation. We collated causes of vertebrate extinctions since 1900, threat information for amphibia, birds, and mammals from the IUCN Red List, and scrutinized others’ attempts to compare climate change with commensurate anthropogenic threats. In each analysis, none of the arguments founded on climate change's wide-ranging effects are as urgent for biodiversity as those for habitat loss and overexploitation. Present conservation efforts must refocus on these issues. Conserving ecosystems by focusing on these major threats not only protects biodiversity but is the only available, economically viable, global strategy to reverse climate change. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={The global reach of zoos has enormous potential to raise awareness of conservation issues such as the amphibian extinction crisis. One mechanism of achieving this is through targeted, time-limited campaigns. However, the longer-term impact of such campaigns on conservation outcomes is rarely evaluated. The goal of this study is to evaluate how zoos view “The Year of The Frog,” a campaign launched by zoos in 2008, with the aim of raising awareness of the global amphibian crisis and generating funds to support amphibian conservation initiatives. A questionnaire-based survey of 43 zoos from fourteen countries was used to evaluate how zoo practitioners believed the campaign influenced amphibian conservation some 10 years after its launch. Survey results showed that the campaign not only contributed to the improvement of research into amphibian husbandry in zoos but also increased support of in situ conservation of amphibians. Zoos focused on exotic species, but developed countries led most of the actions of the campaign. The campaign has inspired and encouraged some zoos and other ex situ conservation organizations to embrace amphibian conservation. The next step is to increase collaboration with more organizations through, for example, AArk and IUCN SSC/ASG, particularly in countries that have high amphibian biodiversity. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={Background: As ecosystem engineers, the construction of dams by beavers alters stream habitat physically and biologically, making them a species of interest for habitat restoration. Beaver-created habitat changes affect a wide range of aquatic invertebrate species. However, despite numerous individual studies of how beavers affect aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages, there has been no evaluation of the consensus of these effects across studies. Methodology: We collated and examined studies comparing beaver-created ponds to nearby lotic reaches to determine general trends in aquatic macroinvertebrate richness, density, biomass, and functional composition between habitats. From this evidence, we highight knowledge gaps in how beaver activity affects aquatic macroinvertebrates. Results: Overall, in the majority of studies, aquatic macroinvertebrate richness was higher in nearby lotic reaches compared to beaver-created ponds, but richness at coarser scales (gamma diversity) increased with the addition of beaver ponds due to increased habitat heterogeneity. Functional feeding group (FFG) patterns were highly context-dependent, though predator taxa were generally more abundant in beaver ponds than adjacent lotic reaches. Site-specific geomorphological changes, coupled with dam or riparian zone characteristics and resulting differences in basal food resources likely shape other FFG responses. Conclusions: We identify a lack of long-term studies at single or multiple sites and conclude that fine-scale approaches may improve our understanding of the dynamics of macroinvertebrates within the freshwater realm and beyond. Due to the context-dependent nature of each study, further systematic studies of beaver engineering effects across a wider variety of environmental conditions and wetland types will also help inform land and species management decisions, such as where to prioritize protection of beaver habitats in the face of a global freshwater biodiversity crisis, or where to restore beaver populations to deliver maximum benefit. © 2022 PeerJ Inc..

abstract={Coastal seascapes are productive and diverse land-sea systems that provide many valuable benefits yet are increasingly threatened by human activity. Scaling up of nature-based solutions (NbS) to effectively protect, sustainably manage, and restore coastal seascapes is urgently required for mitigation of climate change and biodiversity loss while also providing socio-economic benefits. Evidence-based site selection is an important first step to improve the outcomes and avoid negative impacts when prioritizing NbS investments at national level. We developed a spatially explicit, integrative and culturally relevant ecosystem-based site selection process to identify a portfolio of seascapes for NbS consideration in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The primary goal was to rank planning units based on potential for climate change mitigation action, positive impact to biodiversity and socio-economic benefits to people. The multi-criteria site-selection framework provided a rapid, transparent, repeatable and scalable tool. The highest weightings were assigned to blue carbon storage value, biodiversity conservation features, and local stakeholder preferred areas. Spatial proxies for benefits to people were represented by population density and accessibility to coastal seascapes, relative tourism and recreation potential, and importance of fish habitat and fishing grounds for food security. Participatory mapping of local knowledge and review of existing data ensured that both qualitative and quantitative criteria were reliable, up-to-date and locally relevant. Two distinct clusters of high suitability planning units were identified in the Abu Dhabi region and four along the north-western coast of the UAE. Most high suitability sites were located outside of existing marine protected areas. Alternative spatial scenarios without stakeholder bias underscored the suitability of sites identified through participatory mapping and highlighted additional priority sites for future scaling-up of NbS. A spatial corridor of medium and high suitability planning units across the region offers potential for designing well-connected NbS investments to accelerate and boost synergistic outcomes and increase resilience. The site selection framework provides a rapid tool that integrates local and global open access data at a range of scales with great potential for transferability to other regions worldwide.

abstract={Farmland biodiversity has undergone drastic declines due to agricultural intensification during the last decades. To prevent further biodiversity loss, the maintenance and restoration of non-productive habitats is essential. Woodlots, small patches of woody vegetation in agricultural landscapes, are one such habitat that are currently subsidized by the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (EU’s CAP). For effective implementation, however, it is necessary to assess what habitat characteristics are the most beneficial for biodiversity. Our study performs such an assessment using birds as model organisms. Specifically, we related characteristics of various woodlots to (I) the species richness of all birds, and (II) the species richness of both forest and farmland birds–groups with different ecological requirements. For this purpose, we counted birds (27 farmland and 26 forest species) and measured habitat characteristics (describing vegetation structure, diversity and nativeness) and spatial characteristics (area, shape and isolation) in 82 mid-field woodlots (0.76–1.25 ha, average 0.46 ha) in the Czech Republic (Central Europe). After accounting for the effects of spatial characteristics, overall bird species richness increased with vegetation height and woody plant species richness. In addition, richness showed a non-linear decrease with the cover of an invasive tree, the Black Locust Robinia pseudoaccacia. Interestingly, forest bird species richness was related to the same habitat characteristics as the overall bird species richness. By contrast, farmland bird species richness was positively related to the diversity of woodlot microhabitats, which reflects mainly enrichment by non-forest sites such as grassland or sparse shrubs. Our results indicate that the ecological performance of habitat characteristics (and not only the woodlot area) is important for the restoration of bird diversity in woodlots, and as such should be taken into consideration by the EU’s CAP subsidy system. Moreover, if woodlot management aims to maximize the overall bird diversity—a common practice in biodiversity conservation—our results show that current practices may favor widespread forest bird species, but not the farmland birds that are more threatened in Europe. To manage the woodlot habitat for farmland birds, we suggest that microhabitat heterogeneity should be maximized. Copyright © 2022 Dvořáková, Kuczyński, Rivas-Salvador and Reif.},

abstract={Long-term studies on the population dynamics of tropical resident birds are few, and it remains poorly understood how their populations have fared in recent decades. Here, we analyzed a 44-y population study of a Neotropical understory bird assemblage from a protected forest reserve in central Panama to determine if and how populations have changed from 1977 to 2020. Using the number of birds captured in mist nets as an index of local abundance, we estimated trends over time for a diverse suite of 57 resident species that comprised a broad range of ecological and behavioral traits. Estimated abundances of 40 (∼70%) species declined over the sampling period, whereas only 2 increased. Furthermore, declines were severe: 35 of the 40 declining species exhibited large proportional losses in estimated abundance, amounting to ≥50% of their initial estimated abundances. Declines were largely independent of ecology (i.e., body mass, foraging guild, or initial abundance) or phylogenetic affiliation. These widespread, severe declines are particularly alarming, given that they occurred in a relatively large (∼22,000-ha) forested area in the absence of local fragmentation or recent land-use change. Our findings provide robust evidence of tropical bird declines in intact forests and bolster a large body of literature from temperate regions suggesting that bird populations may be declining at a global scale. Identifying the ecological mechanisms underlying these declines should be an urgent conservation priority. © 2022 the Author(s).},

abstract={Understanding drivers and monitoring changes of biodiversity forms the basis for evidence-based management and policy recommendations that aim to reduce biodiversity loss and to ensure the delivery of ecosystem services on which we rely. Ecoacoustic monitoring can be applied across large spatial and temporal scales, offering the potential for less resource-intensive ecosystem monitoring. Indices of acoustic diversity have been shown to correlate with species richness of various taxa, as well as vegetation and landscape structure. In order to apply ecoacoustic monitoring at large scales we need to improve our understanding of the effects of local and regional land-use on acoustic patterns, and assess how temporal aspects of acoustic patterns can be integrated in these analyses. We hypothesized that land-use intensity and landscape structure affect species richness and composition of birds and orthopteran, and therefore indirectly affect acoustic diversity and composition. To test this, we set up autonomous recording systems in grassland plots along land-use intensity gradients in three regions in Germany. We applied structural equation modelling to analyze the direct and indirect drivers of acoustic diversity and composition, including mowing and grazing intensities, landscape diversity, distance to the nearest road, vascular plant species richness as well as bird and orthopteran species richness and composition. Single indices of acoustic diversity did not reflect changes in bird or orthopteran species richness, making them poor predictors for local land-use related changes in species richness in grassland plots. Acoustic composition (non-metric multidimensional scaling combination of mean monthly acoustic indices at different day phases), however, did relate to differences in landscape structure, land-use intensity, vocalizing species composition and orthopteran species richness. We propose the developed acoustic composition metric as suitable proxy to detect ecosystem changes in grasslands. © 2022},

abstract={Convivial conservation has been put forward as a radical alternative to transform prevailing mainstream approaches that aim to address global concerns of biodiversity loss and extinction. This special issue includes contributions from diverse disciplinary and geographical perspectives which critically examine convivial conservation's potential in theory and practice and explore both possibilities and challenges for the approach's transformative ambitions. This introduction focuses on three issues which the contributions highlight as critical for facilitating transformation of mainstream conservation. First, the different ways in which key dimensions of justice - epistemic, distributive, and participatory and multi-species justice - intersect with the convivial conservation proposal, and how potential injustices might be mitigated. Second, how convivial conservation approaches the potential to facilitate human and non-human coexistence. Third, how transformative methodologies and innovative conceptual lenses can be used to further develop convivial conservation. The diverse contributions show that convivial conservation has clear potential to be transformative. However, to realise this potential, convivial conservation must avoid previous proposals' pitfalls, such as trying to 'reinvent the wheel' and being too narrowly focused. Instead, convivial conservation must continue to evolve in response to engagement with a plurality of perspectives, experiences, ideas and methodologies from around the world. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

abstract={As deforestation progresses in the tropics, wildlife populations are increasingly restricted to forest fragments. Here we study genetic population structure in the endangered Ashy red colobus (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) population in the forest fragments surrounding Kibale National Park, Uganda. Subsequently, we use landscape features (elevation, road data and distance to the park) to design a feasible strategy to restore forest in a fashion suitable for both the dispersal patterns of the species and land use practices of the local people. A lack of association between geographic distance and pairwise genetic relatedness among localities, the presence of first degree relatives across localities, and a low global Fst value suggest that red colobus individuals have migrated across this landscape in the recent past. Thus, a series of “stepping stone” forests from the fragments to the park will likely maintain viability of red colobus fragment populations. In this area, low-lying valleys are legally protected to prevent flooding and are considered of low-economic value to local people. We identify such valleys for development of community-based forest restoration efforts that will aid in red colobus conservation and provide various ecosystem services. Our study outlines how genetics and community-based restoration can be integrated to provide realistic conservation solutions. © 2022 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação},

abstract={Megaprojects radically change the landscape due to their large-scale and high investments. Forests are often one of the most affected habitats, as they are frequently included in megaproject construction sites. These habitats support rich animal communities that the new settlement may threaten. Among all species present in any construction site, those listed in the Habitats Directive (92/43/CEE) deserve particular attention as they are protected throughout Europe. Here, we present a case study related to the expansion of an industrial site, part of the megaproject Turin–Lyon high-speed railway, where forest compensations were used to reverse biodiversity loss. The site expansion scheduled for 2020 included mature forests and clearings that used to host a butterfly species and at least 15 bat species protected by the Habitats Directive and other taxa of conservation concern. Forest compensations are usually used to finance tree plantations and forest improvements. In this case study, for the first time, we used them to maintain local biodiversity, which otherwise would have been severely compromised by the site expansion. Indeed, our approach has made it possible to allocate forest compensation funding to restore or improve habitats to favor biodiversity. This approach may be exported to other megaprojects to support local biodiversity. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={One of the major causes of biodiversity loss in freshwater ecosystems is the introduction of alien species. The common carp has been established in every freshwater ecosystem of Pakistan and is a leading threat to the native ichthyofauna. In the present study, stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon (δ15N and δ13C) are used to explore the feeding niche overlap among alien Cyprinus carpio (common carp) and native omnivorous fishes including Tor putitora (mahseer) and Barilius pakistanicus (Pakistani chalwa) from Swat River, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan. Differences in mean values of δ15N and δ13C among the species were found non-significant. Community-wide metrics within δ13C-δ15N bi-plot space reflecting vital aspects of the trophic structure were also calculated. It was found that all the selected species were feeding at the same trophic level, whereas niche size and trophic diversity of common carp was greater compared to both of the native species which indicated that this alien fish is a highly opportunistic feeder on different food items with multiple basal resources having a wide range of δ13C values. Mahseer occupied a very small trophic niche within the niche space of common carp. This shows that mahseer is relatively a specialist feeder on fewer food sources; hence, mahseer might be subjected to the higher threat posed by the alien species. The trophic niche area of Pakistani chalwa was also smaller than common carp but wider than mahseer indicating a relatively lower degree of overlap with common carp. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={The decline of biodiversity from anthropogenic landscape modification is among the most pressing conservation problems worldwide. In North America, long-term population declines have elevated the recovery of the grassland avifauna to among the highest conservationpriorities. Because the vast majority of grasslands of the Great Plains are privately owned, the recovery of these ecosystems and bird populations within them depend on landscape-scale conservation strategies that integrate social, economic, and biodiversity objectives. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a voluntary program for private agricultural producers administered by the United States Department of Agriculture that provides financial incentives to take cropland out of production and restore perennial grassland. We investigated spatial patterns of grassland availability and restoration to inform landscape-scale conservation for a comprehensive community of grassland birds in the Great Plains. The research objectives were to (1) determine how apparent habitat loss has affected spatial patterns of grassland bird biodiversity, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of CRP for offsetting the biodiversity declines of grassland birds, and (3) develop spatially explicit predictions to estimate the biodiversity benefit of adding CRP to landscapes impacted by habitat loss. We used the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions program to evaluate hypotheses for the effects of habitat loss and restoration on both the occupancy and species richness of grassland specialists within a continuum-modeling framework. We found the odds of community occupancy declined by 37% for every 1 SD decrease in grassland availability [loge(km2)] and increased by 20% for every 1 SD increase in CRP land cover [loge(km2)]. There was 17% turnover in species composition between intact grasslands and CRP landscapes, suggesting that grasslands restored by CRP retained considerable, but incomplete, representation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Spatially explicit predictions indicated that absolute conservation outcomes were greatest at high latitudes in regions with high biodiversity, whereas the relative outcomes were greater at low latitudes in highly modified landscapes. By evaluating community-wide responses to landscape modification and CRP restoration at bioregional scales, our study fills key information gaps for developing collaborative strategies, and for balancing conservation of avian biodiversity and social well-being in the agricultural production landscapes of the Great Plains. © 2022 The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Biodiversity conservation is a challenge for today. Studies regarding different ecosystems have become extremely important for understanding communities and promoting strategies for conservation, especially those involving forest restoration as strategy to reverse biodiversity loss. We compared bee diversity indices between three remnants of Atlantic rainforest in southern Brazil and four adjacent areas that were reforested after shale mining, and which are now under different restoration levels. Seven sites were monitored for over 5 years (2011–2016), by sampling bees directly on flowers or in flight using an entomological net, with 400 collected individuals/site/year. Bee species composition differed between post-mining ages and between sites. In all, we sampled 14.185 specimens and 236 bee species. The introduced Africanized Apis mellifera Linnaeus was the most frequent and abundant species, followed by Trigona spinipes and Psaenythia bergii Holmberg. Among habitats, the reforested area in initial phase showed lower richness and diversity in relation all others sample sites. Conversely, all indices were higher in forest remnants, middle phase II, and advanced phase reforested areas, reinforcing the importance of reforestation for conservation, notably endangered species, such as Oxytrigona sp., Schwarziana quadripunctata (Lepeletier), and the solitary species of the genus Hylaeus, all found in the restored areas. These results represent an important contribution for understanding the recovery of the bee fauna in restored mining habitats. The dataset reveals an interesting response in areas that were mined for shale extraction and are now undergoing different levels of restoration, suggesting that older reforested habitats have a higher probability of having a fully recovered bee community. © 2022, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.},

abstract={Long-term population data on endangered species are fundamental to measure conservation implementation objectively, but they are rare, especially in remote forest locations and with total counts. Following the scientific description of the kipunji (Rungwecebus kipunji), we implemented a range of long-term conservation interventions. Thirteen years later, we reassess with a complete count the population size, demography, and distribution of R. kipunji in Tanzania’s Southern Highlands, employing the identical sweep census methods across 1,428 km. We also monitored a habituated group daily over the same period. We report a total of 1,866 individuals in 59 groups (μ = 31.63 ± SE 1.2) in Livingstone Forest (within Kitulo National Park), Mt Rungwe Nature Reserve, and Madehani Village Forest. We estimate a 65% increase in individuals, a 59% increase in group numbers, and a 19% increase in area of occupancy (AoO). Mean group sizes were similar in Mt Rungwe (32.9) and Livingstone (31.9), but lower in the unprotected Madehani (24). The ratio of adult females to adult males was significantly higher in Mt Rungwe than Livingstone. The ratio of subadults/juveniles to adult females, a proxy for survival, was good (1.77), but higher in Livingstone (2.61) than Mt Rungwe (1.11). In the habituated group, we recorded a 121% increase in group size. Signs of human activity fell by 81%, with a 100% and 98% reduction in the number of charcoal pits and timber felling, respectively, in Mt Rungwe. Both temporal and spatial data demonstrate that long-term holistic conservation leads to increased primate numbers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={There have been five Mass Extinction events in the history of Earth's biodiversity, all caused by dramatic but natural phenomena. It has been claimed that the Sixth Mass Extinction may be underway, this time caused entirely by humans. Although considerable evidence indicates that there is a biodiversity crisis of increasing extinctions and plummeting abundances, some do not accept that this amounts to a Sixth Mass Extinction. Often, they use the IUCN Red List to support their stance, arguing that the rate of species loss does not differ from the background rate. However, the Red List is heavily biased: almost all birds and mammals but only a minute fraction of invertebrates have been evaluated against conservation criteria. Incorporating estimates of the true number of invertebrate extinctions leads to the conclusion that the rate vastly exceeds the background rate and that we may indeed be witnessing the start of the Sixth Mass Extinction. As an example, we focus on molluscs, the second largest phylum in numbers of known species, and, extrapolating boldly, estimate that, since around AD 1500, possibly as many as 7.5–13% (150,000–260,000) of all ~2 million known species have already gone extinct, orders of magnitude greater than the 882 (0.04%) on the Red List. We review differences in extinction rates according to realms: marine species face significant threats but, although previous mass extinctions were largely defined by marine invertebrates, there is no evidence that the marine biota has reached the same crisis as the non-marine biota. Island species have suffered far greater rates than continental ones. Plants face similar conservation biases as do invertebrates, although there are hints they may have suffered lower extinction rates. There are also those who do not deny an extinction crisis but accept it as a new trajectory of evolution, because humans are part of the natural world; some even embrace it, with a desire to manipulate it for human benefit. We take issue with these stances. Humans are the only species able to manipulate the Earth on a grand scale, and they have allowed the current crisis to happen. Despite multiple conservation initiatives at various levels, most are not species oriented (certain charismatic vertebrates excepted) and specific actions to protect every living species individually are simply unfeasible because of the tyranny of numbers. As systematic biologists, we encourage the nurturing of the innate human appreciation of biodiversity, but we reaffirm the message that the biodiversity that makes our world so fascinating, beautiful and functional is vanishing unnoticed at an unprecedented rate. In the face of a mounting crisis, scientists must adopt the practices of preventive archaeology, and collect and document as many species as possible before they disappear. All this depends on reviving the venerable study of natural history and taxonomy. Denying the crisis, simply accepting it and doing nothing, or even embracing it for the ostensible benefit of humanity, are not appropriate options and pave the way for the Earth to continue on its sad trajectory towards a Sixth Mass Extinction. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Soil fauna communities are an important component of soil biodiversity, which is key to myriad terrestrial ecosystem processes. However, despite the current alarming loss of plant diversity, it remains unclear how plant diversity affects soil fauna communities. By synthesizing 623 paired observations of plant mixtures and corresponding monocultures from 40 studies, we examined the effects of plant mixtures on soil fauna abundance and diversity. Further, we investigated the dependence of mixture effects on species richness, stand age, climate conditions, and ecosystem types. We found that, on average, the diversity of soil fauna was 10% higher in plant mixtures than the average of corresponding monocultures, while the abundance of fauna did not differ significantly between the mixtures and the average of monocultures. The mixture effects on both soil fauna abundance and diversity increased with plant species richness in mixtures, which resulted in higher abundance and diversity of soil fauna in species-rich plant mixtures than the averages of their corresponding monocultures. Moreover, the effects of plant mixtures on soil fauna abundance increased over time in diverse species mixtures. After accounting for the effects of species richness in mixtures and stand age, the effects of plant mixtures on the abundance and diversity of soil fauna were consistent across soil depths, ecosystem types, and climate conditions. Our analysis highlights the potential importance of plant diversity conservation for the maintenance of soil fauna communities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Farmland biodiversity have experienced a steep decline over recent decades. Various conservation measures, including EU agri-environmental schemes (AES), have been designed to prevent further biodiversity loss. Despite the AES were criticized for limited benefits for biodiversity, the existing conservation evidence demonstrated some AES, such as seed-rich strips (SRS), can have a positive effect on overall biodiversity. However, evidence of the effectiveness of SRS during winter is largely missing in Eastern Europe or it is based on single-species evaluations. In our study, we investigate the effects of SRS on several taxa typical of the farmland (i.e., farmland birds, European hare, roe deer and small mammals) during winter, when these species may suffer from a lack of food sources. More specifically, we evaluated the effect of spatial location (hedges, forests, and open fields), time in the season (early and late winter), and area (Single Large or Several Small analysis, i.e., “SLOSS analysis”) of SRS on species richness and abundance of birds and mammals. SRS showed higher species richness and abundance than control transects, except for roe deer. The largest differences in abundance and species richness of farmland birds between the SRS and the controls were found in the fields. The highest abundance of European hare and small mammals were found in SRS located in the fields. Ordination analysis indicated that several bird species preferred SRS. Moreover, different birds occurred in strips adjacent to open fields, hedges, and forest, indicating that the landscape context of SRS can affect its use by different bird species. We found a significant decrease in the abundance of farmland birds and declining farmland species during late winter in the SRS, but not in the controls, suggesting the SRS may be depleted of seeds towards the end of winter. Finally, the SLOSS analysis indicated there was no clear difference in species richness between small-to-large and large-to-small strips accumulation, but the pooled abundance of all birds and mammals was generally higher at a few large rather than many small patches of the same cumulative size. Our findings suggest that SRS are a simple and cost-effective measure for farmland biodiversity conservation. Even relatively small SRS are used by many species and therefore should be promoted. SRS careful planning (e.g., location of SRS within the landscape and the choice of seed mixtures) can improve their effectiveness for biodiversity conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In tropical ecosystems, habitat degradation and fragmentation are some of the most important drivers of biodiversity loss. In Colombia, the Magdalena River basin is home to a megadiverse wildlife community, which has been historically exposed to pervasive habitat loss and fragmentation. Within a long-term project on the conservation of critically endangered brown spider monkeys (Ateles hybridus), we signed conservation agreements with local landowners to protect the remaining forests and reconnect them through restoration corridors. We established 10 corridors within a matrix of pastures used for cattle-ranching which reconnect approximately 1,000 ha of forests. We planted trees in 2016/2017 and 2020, established 24 vegetation plots (10 × 10 m) to measure their structure and composition, and compared them with six vegetation plots (50 × 2 m) in forest fragments. We installed camera traps to evaluate the effectiveness of corridors as potential pathways for terrestrial vertebrates in a fragmented landscape. Overall, forest structure differed between young corridors (1 year) and both older corridors (5 years) and forests; older corridors had no structural differences with forest fragments. Throughout this preliminary survey, 21 out of 32 species of vertebrates that have been recorded in forests used the corridors, including apex predators and other large birds and mammals. This study provides initial data supporting the use of corridors as a strategy to reconnect wildlife in isolated forest fragments in heavily fragmented landscapes, as well as the establishment of effective corridors that reconnect forest-dwelling species in relatively short periods of time (<5 years). © 2021 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract={Agriculture, cattle grazing, and human settlements negatively affect bird biodiversity, driving the loss of ecologically specialized species and favoring the dominance of generalists. Because ecological pressures define organisms’ success by acting on their intrinsic traits, biodiversity loss due to anthropization might cause directional trait shifts. Here, we use a trait-based approach to find empirical evidence of trait-shifts in bird communities across an anthropization gradient in seasonal forests in central Mexico. We performed point-count bird surveys within a region of tropical deciduous and seasonal oak forests considering three degrees of anthropization: primary forest, secondary growth, and human settlements. A multivariate analysis (PCA) showed similar trait-covariation patterns for both forest types; in the anthropized habitat the bird communities exhibited shorter life-cycles, higher fecundity, and broader ecological niches (diet, foraging habitat, and nesting resources) than those in the primary forests. Our finding of directional trait shifts resembles Evolutionary Ecological Strategies Theory (EES) predictions for successful organisms within highly disturbed anthropized habitats, which are known as a “ruderal adaptative strategy” in the EES framework. The use of trait-based approaches could improve ecological generalizations in bird communities, leading to a better understanding of avian biodiversity's responses to anthropization. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação},

abstract={Hydropower infrastructure represents a major driver of habitat loss and insular fragmentation worldwide, mostly across the tropics and sub-tropics. Despite growing evidence of dam-induced impacts on biodiversity, the effects of insular habitat fragmentation on species assemblages remain poorly understood, particularly for East Asian vertebrates. Here, we assess how insectivorous bats respond to forest fragmentation in Thousand Island Lake, a mega-hydroelectric dam in East China. Bat assemblages were surveyed across 36 land-bridge islands of different sizes and degrees of isolation, using AudioMoth recorders. Echolocation calls were classified into sonotypes, each corresponding to either single or multiple species, which were further classified according to their habitat affinities into forest or open-space foragers. Based on 22 875 five-min recordings from 108 detector-nights, we recorded 15 bat sonotypes, eight of which we classified as forest sonotypes (2329 bat passes) and seven as open-space sonotypes (52 277 bat passes). Overall, sonotype richness increased with island area, but only above a certain threshold (34 ha). Habitat affinity played an important role in ensemble-level responses to fragmentation; forest sonotype richness increased with island area, whereas open-space sonotype activity was higher in more isolated islands. Our results highlight the relevance of particularly large fragments (>1000 ha) to maintain area-sensitive forest bat species. However, islands below 34 ha in size and those more isolated from the mainland are also of conservation value as they, correspondingly, harbour a variable (but substantial) number of species and concentrate higher activity of open-space foragers. These findings further demonstrate that acoustic sampling methods, as the one presented here, are able to provide key information for evidence-based policies aimed at halting the ongoing wave of dam-induced biodiversity loss. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The trade in wild meat is an important economic component of rural people's livelihoods, but it has been perceived to be among the main causes of the decline of wildlife species. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light an additional concern of wildlife markets as a major human-health challenge. We analyzed data from the largest longitudinal monitoring (1973–2018) of the most important urban wild-meat markets in Iquitos, Peru, to examine the trends in and impacts of these markets on people's livelihoods. Over the last 45 years, wild meat sales increased at a rate of 6.4 t/year (SD 2.17), paralleling urban population growth. Wild meat sales were highest in 2018 (442 t), contributing US$2.6 million (0.76%) to the regional gross domestic product. Five species of ungulates and rodents accounted for 88.5% of the amount of biomass traded. Vulnerable and Endangered species represented 7.0% and 0.4% of individuals sold, respectively. Despite growth in sales, the contribution of wild meat to overall urban diet was constant: 1–2%/year of total meat consumed. This result was due to greater availability and higher consumption of cheaper meats (e.g., in 2018, poultry was 45.8% cheaper and was the most consumed meat) coupled with the lack of economic incentives to harvest wild meat species in rural areas. Most wild meat was sold salted or smoked, reducing the likelihood of foodborne diseases. Community-based wildlife management plans and the continued trade bans on primates and threatened taxa may avoid biodiversity loss. Considering the recent COVID-19 pandemic, future management plans should include potential viral hosts and regulation and enforcement of hygiene practices in wild-meat markets. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Urbanization constitutes one of the most aggressive drivers of habitat and biodiversity loss worldwide. However, studies focused on determining the response of local biodiversity to urbanization are still scarce, especially in tropical ecosystems. Urban ecosystems are characterized by low biological productivity which in turn leads to a reduction in biodiversity. However, the responses to urbanization should be species dependent. For instance, changes in the availability of resources can favor certain species with specific characteristics. We assessed the effects of the urbanization process on a bird community in a city located in the Tropical Andes of southern Ecuador, a region widely recognized for its diversity and endemism of birds. We selected three independent localities in each of the four levels of the urbanization gradient in the study area (forest, forest-pasture, pasture, and urban). In each locality, we sampled the bird community by visual and auditory surveys along 1 km transects between 2016 and 2017. We recorded a total of 1,257 individuals belonging to 74 bird species. We evaluated if the responses of richness and abundance of birds are dependent on trophic guild and foraging strata. We found a significant decrease in bird species richness and abundance from forest to urban sites. However, the response of birds was dependent on the trophic guild and foraging strata. Granivorous birds showed a positive response associated with the urbanization gradient while insectivorous birds showed a negative response. Insectivorous birds were more abundant in forest sites and decreased in abundance across the urbanization gradient. We found that the proportion of birds using different foraging strata drastically changed along urban gradient. Forest sites exhibited a bird community using a variety of habitats, but the bird community became simpler toward the most urbanized sites. Our findings showed different effects of urbanization on bird communities. The ugly: urbanization leads to a dramatic reduction in the diversity of birds, which is consistent in cities with different characteristics and ecological contexts. On the other hand, the responses of bird guilds to urbanization are species dependent. Some guilds are positively impacted by urbanization and show increases in species richness and abundance while other guilds are negatively impacted.

abstract={Black and gold howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) inhabit several eco-regions in South America with the highest population densities in riverine forests. Dam construction for electricity production represents a severe human alteration of ecosystems with consequences for primate conservation. To evaluate the possible loss of genetic diversity in A. caraya, we analysed and compared the genetic structure of the species across 22 study sites in Argentina (14), Paraguay (1), and Brazil (7). Four of these study sites (referred to as flooded) were sampled before dam-linked flooding which most likely caused a drastic decline or functional extinction of these populations. The genetic variability of 256 individuals was evaluated using 10 autosomal microsatellites (STRs) and 112 individuals by sequencing a fragment of 507 bp of mtDNA. DNA was extracted from tissue, blood, and faecal samples. Significantly higher values of genetic variability were observed for the flooded populations both in mtDNA and STRs. Population genetic structure showed a K = 1, 2, or 5 depending on the method, separating Argentinian and Paraguayan sites from Brazilian sites and, in the case of K = 5, two clusters were mostly represented by flooded populations. Isolation-by-distance analyses showed that geographic distances influence gene flow. Analytical methods, such as Pairwise Fst’s and Nei’s and regression model of Harpending and Ward, were concordant in detecting significant genetic structuring between flooded and remaining sites examined. Although some sites have very low sample sizes, these samples are of great importance since these sampling sites are currently flooded. Our results show that the study sites where dams were built had the greatest genetic diversity. As A. caraya is currently severely threatened by yellow fever outbreaks, the remaining populations may be more vulnerable to disease outbreaks due to impoverished genetic variability. Accordingly, it is essential to implement management actions to conserve the remaining populations. Our results underline the importance for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) to include data on the genetic structure of species in the affected sites prior to their alteration or destruction. These genetic data are also remarkably important for determining where to relocate specific individuals to help avoid biodiversity loss.

abstract={The major rivers across the world have become artificial regulation systems controlled by cascade reservoirs. River fish, as an important part of freshwater ecosystems, are under threat of population degradation and biodiversity loss in the process of development and utilization of river water energy resources. The ecological operation of the reservoir is eco-environmental protection to alleviate the negative impact on ecosystems, which artificially creates hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions to meet the requirement of fish during key life periods. However, based on ecological operation practical experience, there are circumstances where downstream flow conditions are inconsistent with the fish requirement in local periods affected by different operation conditions of reservoirs. That means the ecological operation still needs improvement. This paper takes the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station, and the downstream Gezhouba Dam, as a case study, builds a joint operation model of cascade reservoirs, simulates and analyzes the feasibility of the cascade reservoirs to improve the spawning conditions of fish in the downstream river reaches under joint operation and discusses the optimal strategy. In most cases, the target of continuous flow rising for hourly timescale can be accomplished only by the hourly exquisite operation of Gezhouba reservoir, which is required for the four major Chinese carps spawning downstream of Gezhouba Dam. What's more, the hydropower generation output can be improved to a certain extent, thus achieving win-win progress of ecology and economics. The results of this paper show that Gezhouba reservoir can adjust the daily discharge process of the Three Gorges Reservoir by the re-regulation during a specific period of ecological operation, which may function as a useful reference for the optimization practice of ecological operation of cascade reservoirs. © 2022 by Journal of Lake Sciences.},

abstract={The systematic degradation of marine ecosystems is a global phenomenon that has important and diverse consequences including biodiversity loss and reduced ecosystem service provisions. In temperate regions, subtidal kelp forests are dominant ecosystems in rocky coasts, subjected to the influence of local-scale stressors and regional environmental variation. For example, kelps within the Humboldt Current System are at risk of degradation from live-harvesting by fisheries. However, limited information exists regarding the long-term consequences of kelp harvesting, which, in turn, limits the ability to provide effective management and conservation efforts. Here, we examined the ecosystem-level consequences of the artisanal subtidal Lessonia trabeculata fishery along the coast of central Chile during a 2-year period, assessing (1) the change in adult and juvenile L. trabeculata density within harvested and nonharvested (control) plots (~90 m2), (2) the impact of L. trabeculata harvesting on reef fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages, and (3) the change in density of the most abundant L. trabeculata-associated species. The experiment was conducted over a 2-year period, from December 2016 to May 2019. Approximately 90% of L. trabeculata was removed by an experienced kelp fisherman in experimental plots. After 2 years, L. trabeculata and its associated community showed a lack of recovery in the harvested plots. Within these plots, the average abundance of the rock shrimp, Rhynchocinetes typus, and the herbivorous snail, Tegula tridentata, was greater than in nonharvested plots and the pattern persisted over the study period. The difference in abundance of associated species may be key to the (lack of) recovery of L. trabeculata forests. Our study highlights the impact of L. trabeculata harvesting on associated fauna; however, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the capacity and time frame to reestablish the original biomass of L. trabeculata, as well as its associated fauna. The management of L. trabeculata fisheries needs to account for ecosystem-wide impacts in order to better manage and protect vital coastal ecosystems. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Funding biodiversity conservation strategies are usually minimal, thus prioritizing habitats at high risk should be conducted. We developed and tested a conservation priority index (CPI) that ranks habitats to aid in prioritizing them for conservation. We tested the index using 1897 fish species from 273 African inland lakes and 34 countries. In the index, lake surface area, rarity, and their International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List status were incorporated. We retrieved data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and IUCN data repositories. Lake Nyasa had the highest species richness (424), followed by Tanganyika (391), Nokoué (246), Victoria (216), and Ahémé (216). However, lakes Otjikoto and Giunas had the highest CPI of 137.2 and 52.1, respectively. Lakes were grouped into high priority (CPI > 0.5; n = 56) and low priority (CPI < 0.5; n = 217). The median surface area between priority classes was significantly different (W = 11,768, p <.05, effect size = 0.65). Prediction accuracy of Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for priority classes were 0.912 and 0.954, respectively. Both models exhibited lake surface area as the variable with the highest importance. CPI generally increased with a decrease in lake surface area. This was attributed to less ecological substitutability and higher exposure levels of anthropogenic stressors such as pollution to a species in smaller lakes. Also, the highest species richness per unit area was recorded for high-priority lakes. Thus, smaller habitats or lakes may be prioritized for conservation although larger waterbodies or habitats should not be ignored. The index can be customized to local, regional, and international scales as well as marine and terrestrial habitats. © 2022 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The present study was carried out to document traditional ethnobotanical knowledge (TEK) of herbal flora of District Bhimber, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Pakistan to explore medicinal potential of wild indigenous plants (WIPs) for drug discovery. The research data was conducted during years 2015–2017 using questionnaire proforma employing structured and semi-structured interview models. The informants belonged from indigenous communities comprising of both genders with age ranging from 35–105 years. The interviews were conducted using local translator or guide who knew the dialects of all local languages. The study produced ethnobotanical inventory of 173 herbal species belonging to 45 families and out of these Poaceae was dominant family with 27 species. It was explored that maximum herbal species depicted multi-usage especially food, fodder and fuel. Among 173 herbal plant species, 69% species were used as fodder, 72% species as fuel source, 9.8% as ethnoveterinary medicines, 16% for home construction, 12% for cosmetics, 5.2% as honeybee plants and 2.7% were used as fiber source by the local people. Many local plants have been in promulgation for cure of different diseases in traditional cultures such as for cure of stomach problems, cough, cancer, jaundice, kidney diseases, diabetes, snake biting and tooth problems. Different parts of plants such as leaf, root, stem bark, flower, seed and gums are used for the treatment of different diseases by the local people. The major aliments being cured are classified into 12 disease categories by using informant consensus factor (ICF) protocol. According to ICF, the highest numbers of plant species were used against wound healing, snake bite, skin diseases, eye diseases and asthma. Fidelity level (FL) was assessed to check the reliability and use consistency of herbal drugs by the indigenous communities of the study area. The use value index (UVI) of different herb species ranged from 0.29 to 0.57 while the highest value was calculated for Alternanthera pungens L. (UVI: 0.57). Relative frequency of citation (RFC) value was calculated on the bases of the response of the interviewees recorded during survey in correlation with authenticating of traditional data. The RFC values represented the relative popularity of individual species in study area according to their use values. The highest value was calculated for Alternanthera pungens L. (0.90) and followed by Achyranthes aspera L. (0.80. The study reveals that many species are known for commonly used in traditional ethnomedicines (TEMs). Due to different biotic and abiotic factors in conjunction with climatic changes many herbal flora of Shiwalik mountain range (SMR) of District Bhimber of AJK is under threat. The factors like habitat loss, overgrazing, construction of communication infrastructure, silviculture practices, shelter construction (houses) and other more domestic use of wild land by clearing wild lands are boosting towards plant biodiversity loss. There is dare need to work on comprehensive exploration of TEMs to discover neo drugs from wild indigenous plants and do work for conservation of wild flora of the area for future generations.

abstract={Improving agricultural production in response to the increasing food demand remains a major challenge in agroecology. The world has made significant efforts to meet this issue by developing several cultivation techniques, such as the use of chemical fertilizers and arable land conversion into agricultural land. However, most of these techniques have caused a significant loss of biodiversity and ecosystems services. Recent data suggest that biological conservation within and around agroforestry systems are potential solutions that can both reduce biodiversity loss and guarantee crop production. This logic is based on the hypothesis that increasing plant diversity in and around agricultural systems can limit the pest attack rate and increase crop yield. We tested this hypothesis using structural equation modeling on empirical data collected in agroforestry systems around the Pendjari biosphere reserve in West Africa. We measured crop diversity, crop yield, arthropod pest diversity, abundance, the rate of crop herbivory, and the diversity of plants in surrounding natural vegetation in 32 permanent plots. We estimated arthropod diversity and abundance using pitfall traps. We found a direct positive effect for plant diversity and a direct negative effect of arthropod herbivory on crop yield. The diversity of plants in surrounding natural vegetation had a direct positive effect on arthropod pest diversity but a marginal negative direct effect on the rate of crop herbivory. We found no significant direct or indirect effect for crop diversity. Our findings underline the important role of biodiversity conservation in agricultural production improvement. We suggest that the conservation of plant diversity around agroforestry systems may be an effective option to control herbivory damage. Its combination with other pest control techniques may further limit crop depredation and ensure the long-term conservation of wildlife. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The climate and biodiversity crises reveal a failing human-nature relationship. The psychological construct of nature connectedness provides a means for understanding and improving that relationship. Furthermore, recent research suggests that higher levels of nature connectedness benefit both people and the environment, promoting pro-nature conservation actions, pro-environmental behaviors, and greater personal well-being. Nature connectedness is, therefore, emerging as a key target to improve human and nature's well-being. Using data from a large national survey in the United Kingdom, the present research investigates how nature contact and noticing nature activities predict nature connectedness. Multiple regression analyses revealed that noticing nature, through activities that involve active sensory engagement with wildlife, explained levels of nature connectedness over and above simply spending time in nature. Moreover, the activities engaged in when in nature had differential effects on nature connectedness. Watching, listening to, and photographing wildlife were significant predictors of nature connectedness, whereas studying nature, looking at scenery through windows, observing celestial phenomena, and collecting shells and rocks were not. The results have implications for how best to improve nature connectedness, both in terms of how to design and improve greenspaces, and in terms of how to better engage the public with nature for a healthy and sustainable future. © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert Inc.},

abstract={Habitat loss is a significant driver of biodiversity loss, causing fragmentation into small, isolated patches of suitable land cover. This reduces the permeability of landscapes to the movement of individuals and reduces the likelihood of metapopulation persistence. Quantifying functional connectivity, the ability of a focal species to move between resource patches, is therefore essential for conservation management. There is substantial evidence supporting a technique based on ‘population synchrony’- the degree of correlation in time-series of annual population growth rates between different long-term monitoring sites, to provide a measure of functional connectivity. However, synchronised population dynamics are not only driven by the movement of individuals between sites, but also shared environmental conditions which must be accounted for. Here, we use species survey data from over four decades to investigate average levels and temporal trends in population synchrony for 58 British bird and butterfly species. We first show that population synchrony is significantly associated with synchrony in some seasonal climatic variables. Once we accounted for spatiotemporal climatic patterns, we found that synchrony in butterflies declined over time by 71% between 1985 and 2000 but increased by 64% in recent years. Synchrony in birds showed some decline between 1999 and 2005, after which there appears to being recovery, however most species (74%) show no significant overall change in synchrony. Our proposed indicator provides a ‘species-eye-view’ of functional connectivity using widely available abundance data. Developing such indicators of functional connectivity, which can be updated annually, is crucial to improve the effectiveness of land management strategies for conservation under increasing environmental change. © 2022},

abstract={Against the background of widespread biodiversity loss, the issue of ecological connectivity has become increasingly important in recent decades at EU level. This growing attention can be observed in particular in biodiversity strategies or certain directives, in the establishment of key programmes or in the mobilisation of various types of funds. However, there is currently no EU framework that explicitly obliges member states to address the issue or to achieve certain objectives in this field. This article first shows how ecological connectivity has gradually emerged as a spatial planning issue, in particular through national/federal and/or regional legislative developments, in different countries (Germany, Italy and France). A focus on the French context and its Green and Blue Network Policy then depicts the implementation challenges observed in spatial planning at the regional, sub-regional and local levels. The paper highlights the difficulty of establishing a standardised framework for ecological connectivity, which implies considering the complexity of wildlife in spatial planning procedures in which potentially divergent interests intersect. © 2022},

abstract={Prioritizing threatened species protection has been proposed as an efficient response to the global biodiversity crisis. We used in-situ conservation data to predict the potential habitat area of four flagship species: the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), golden monkey (Rhinopithecus roxella quinlingensis), takin (Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi), and crested ibis (Nipponia nippon). We then designed systematic conservation planning schemes for various scenarios given species habitat preferences and anthropogenic activities and conducted a cost-effectiveness assessment. Broadly, the geographical distributions of suitable habitats for giant pandas, golden monkeys, and takins exhibited high spatial congruence (correlation coefficients of 0.59–0.90), and areas of high congruence were concentrated in the northern portion of the Qinling Mountains at high elevation (>1500 m). By contrast, the crested ibis was negatively correlated in space with its sympatric species (−0.47 to −0.29). Crested ibis habitats were clustered in the southern portion of the region at low elevation (<1500 m). A hypothetical conservation priority area (CPA) based on the giant panda, golden monkey, and takin included 39.64% of the Qinling Mountains and 100%, 99.99%, 99.59%, and 7.84% of the suitable habitats for giant pandas, golden monkeys, takins, and crested ibises, respectively. The same area included 99.07%, 70.87%, and 39.96% of the highly important areas for the ecosystem services of biodiversity conservation, water supply, and soil retention, respectively, and only 4.62%, 16.83%, and 13.4% of the area were associated with high-density residential area, impervious surfaces, and cropland, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that a CPA approach based on the specialist species could result in effective, low-cost biodiversity conservation in the Qinling Mountains. However, we note that existing protected areas account for only 26.52% of the CPA. We recommend that the main area of the proposed Qinling National Park should be based on the CPA developed here. © 2021},

abstract={Local, regional and global targets have been set to halt marine biodiversity loss. Europe has set its own policy targets to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) of marine ecosystems by implementing the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) across member states. We combined an extensive dataset across five Mediterranean ecoregions including 26 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), their reference unprotected areas, and a no-trawl case study. Our aim was to assess if MPAs reach GES, if their effects are local or can be detected at ecoregion level or up to a Mediterranean scale, and which are the ecosystem components driving GES achievement. This was undertaken by using the analytical tool NEAT (Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool), which allows an integrated assessment of the status of marine systems. We adopted an ecosystem approach by integrating data from several ecosystem components: the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, macroalgae, sea urchins and fish. Thresholds to define the GES were set by dedicated workshops and literature review. In the Western Mediterranean, most MPAs are in good/high status, with P. oceanica and fish driving this result within MPAs. However, GES is achieved only at a local level, and the Mediterranean Sea, as a whole, results in a moderate environmental status. Macroalgal forests are overall in bad condition, confirming their status at risk. The results are significantly affected by the assumption that discrete observations over small spatial scales are representative of the total extension investigated. This calls for large-scale, dedicated assessments to realistically detect environmental status changes under different conditions. Understanding MPAs effectiveness in reaching GES is crucial to assess their role as sentinel observatories of marine systems. MPAs and trawling bans can locally contribute to the attainment of GES and to the fulfillment of the MSFD objectives. Building confidence in setting thresholds between GES and non-GES, investing in long-term monitoring, increasing the spatial extent of sampling areas, rethinking and broadening the scope of complementary tools of protection (e.g., Natura 2000 Sites), are indicated as solutions to ameliorate the status of the basin. © 2021},

abstract={Agricultural landscapes are characterized by a variety of habitats resulting from man-made transformations of the natural environment. Progressing agricultural intensification is leading to a reduction in natural and semi-natural habitats, resulting in turn in a loss of biodiversity. In farmland, natural habitats such as field margins, hedgerows, and meadows are progressively declining or being transformed. There is a need for regionally adjusted schemes that balance agricultural production and biodiversity conservation due to strong differences even within one country. We present a potential tool that can mitigate biodiversity loss in farmland ecosystems. In this study, we compared transects on three different habitat types: unused railway lines, dirt road verges and fields in terms of overall, farmland and open land bird species abundance, richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index as well as community composition in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. We predicted that 1) bird abundance, species richness and diversity would be greater in vegetation structure along unused railway lines due to their spontaneous vegetation character than in other habitats, and 2) bird community composition would be different between three habitat types (unused railway lines, farmland roads and transects in farming areas). Our findings demonstrated that habitats along unused railway lines provide a suitable environment for farmland birds, increasing bird diversity in the agricultural landscape and playing a wider role in biodiversity conservation. Vegetation structures along unused railway lines may act as alternative refuges for birds in each season, providing food resources, nesting, shelter, perching, singing, and resting sites as well as constitute a kind of ecological corridor running within an intensively used agricultural landscape. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Forest fragmentation is the main cause of biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene and it is triggering a top-down cascade effect that may influence leaf litter decomposition. However, the link between biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem processes is not fully understood. We conducted an experiment to evaluate whether the exclusion of vertebrates affects the decomposition rates of different litter types (grass, a pioneer species and a mix of litters from a well preserved secondary forest). To answer this question, we placed litter bags inside artificial exclusion plots that were built in two types of vegetation coverage (abandoned pastureland and preserved forest) in the Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil. Our hypothesis is that vertebrate exclusion will change decomposition rates of different litter types due to the top-down cascade effect on soil invertebrates. We found out that vertebrate exclusion did not affect decomposition rates, possibly due to the overlap of ecological functions in the soil fauna responsible for the decomposition process. Furthermore, grass litter was decomposed faster (k value), possibly due to its initial nutrient content and hence litter quality which plays a significant role on decomposition rates. © 2021, International Society for Tropical Ecology.},

abstract={Context: Invasive species are major drivers of biodiversity loss, requiring management to reduce their ecological impacts. Population genetics can be applied to delineate management units, providing information that can help plan and improve control strategies. Aim: The present study aims to use a genetic approach to test the existence of three previously proposed sambar deer populations in south-eastern Australia. In doing so, the study aims to delineate management units of sambar deer in south-eastern Australia. Methods: Sambar deer DNA was sourced opportunistically from tissue samples and targeted scat collection. Samples were collected from three areas in Victoria, south-eastern Australia: Mt Cole (MC), French Island (FI) and eastern Victoria (EV). Contemporary population structure was assessed using a suite of 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. The number of maternal sambar deer lineages in south-eastern Australia was investigated through sequencing of the mitochondrial (mt)DNA control region. Key results: Three distinct genetic clusters were identified. Differentiation among inferred clusters was found to be high, with FST ranging from 0.24 between EV and FI clusters and 0.48 between MC and FI clusters. Two mtDNA haplotypes were identified; R.u1 was found throughout EV and FI, and R.u2 was unique to MC. DNA isolated from scats provided reliable data and proved critical for sampling areas where hunting and culling of deer are not generally undertaken. Conclusions: Three genetically distinct sambar deer management units in south-eastern Australia are defined-MC, FI and EV. Sambar deer control strategies should be applied to each management unit independently. This may be difficult or infeasible for the EV management unit, which is large and geographically complex. Further research may help identify additional fine-scale genetic structure in EV, allowing smaller, more practicable management units to be identified. Implications: Genetic data can be used to identify management units for invasive species, which will be critical for the development of future management strategies and improving control operations. The approach outlined here could also be applied to improve the management of other introduced deer species in south-eastern Australia. © 2022 CSIRO Open Access.},

abstract={Conservation genomics is an important tool to manage threatened species under current biodiversity loss. Recent advances in sequencing technology mean that we can now use whole genomes to investigate demographic history, local adaptation, inbreeding, and more in unprecedented detail. However, for many rare and elusive species only non-invasive samples such as faeces can be obtained, making it difficult to take advantage of whole genome data. We present a method to extract DNA from the mucosal layer of faecal samples to re-sequence high coverage whole genomes using standard laboratory techniques. We use wild collected faecal pellets collected from caribou (Rangifer tarandus), a species undergoing declines in many parts of its range in Canada and subject to comprehensive conservation and population monitoring measures. We compare four faecal genomes to two tissue genomes sequenced in the same run. Quality metrics were similar between faecal and tissue samples with the main difference being the alignment success of raw reads to the reference genome due to differences in low quality and endogenous DNA content, affecting overall coverage. One of our faecal genomes was only re-sequenced at low coverage (1.6 ×), however the other three obtained between 7 and 15 ×, compared to 19 and 25 × for the tissue samples. We successfully re-sequenced high-quality whole genomes from faecal DNA and are one of the first to obtain genome-wide data from wildlife faecal DNA in a non-primate species. Our work represents an important advancement for non-invasive conservation genomics. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Zoonotic disease emergence has become a core concern of biodiversity conservation amid the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Major international conservation groups now comprehensively center larger human–nature imbalances not only as problems of global public health but as a core challenge of the conservation movement, alongside habitat destruction, biodiversity loss and climate change. There is, however, little consideration of how new biosecurity concerns might alter conservation practice with unexpected and potential harmful impacts on human communities, particularly in developing nations with significant human–wildlife interfaces. Reviewing emerging policy positions from key conservation organizations, this article argues that the proposed responses to the COVID-19 pandemic hold the potential to (a) amplify existing people-park conflicts, and (b) generate new tensions by integrating global systems of viral surveillance into biodiversity conservation. I conclude that the close integration of biosecurity concerns into conservation policies requires greater acknowledgment of the unique challenges for human communities. © 2021, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={For prioritizing conservation actions, it is vital to understand how ecologically diverse species respond to environmental change caused by human activity. This is particularly necessary considering that chronic human disturbance is a threat to biodiversity worldwide. Depending on how species tolerate and adapt to such disturbance, ecological integrity and ecosystem services will be more or less affected. Bats are a species-rich and functionally diverse group, with important roles in ecosystems, and are therefore recognized as a good model group for assessing the impact of environmental change. Their populations have decreased in several regions, especially in the tropics, and are threatened by increasing human disturbance. Using passive acoustic monitoring, we assessed how the species-rich aerial insectivorous bats—essential for insect suppression services—respond to chronic human disturbance in the Caatinga dry forests of Brazil, an area potentially harboring ca. 100 bat species (nearly 50% are insectivorous), but with > 60% its area composed of anthropogenic ecosystems under chronic pressure. Acoustic data for bat activity was collected at research sites with varying amounts of chronic human disturbance (e.g., livestock grazing and firewood gathering). The intensity of the disturbance is indicated by the global multi-metric CAD index (GMDI). Using Animal Sound Identifier (ASI) software, we identified 18 different bat taxon units. Using Hierarchical Modeling of Species Communities (HMSC), we found trends in the association of the disturbance gradient with species richness and bat activity: species richness was higher at sites with higher human disturbance, whereas bat activity decreased with increasing human disturbance. Additionally, we observed taxon-specific responses to human disturbance. We conclude that the effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance on the insectivorous bat fauna in the Caatinga are not homogeneous and a species-specific approach is necessary when assessing the responses of local bats to human disturbances in tropical dry forests, and in other biomes under human pressure.

abstract={Protected areas and renewable energy generation are critical tools to combat biodiversity loss and climate change, respectively. Over the coming decades, expansion of the protected area network to meet conservation objectives will be occurring alongside rapid deployment of renewable energy infrastructure to meet climate targets, driving potential conflict for a finite land resource. Renewable energy infrastructure can have negative effects on wildlife, and co-occurrence may mean emissions targets are met at the expense of conservation objectives. Here, we assess current and projected overlaps of wind and solar photovoltaic installations and important conservation areas across nine global regions using spatially explicit wind and solar data and methods for predicting future renewable expansion. We show similar levels of co-occurrence as previous studies but demonstrate that once area is accounted for, previous concerns about overlaps in the Northern Hemisphere may be largely unfounded, although they are high in some biodiverse countries (e.g., Brazil). Future projections of overlap between the two land uses presented here are generally dependent on priority threshold and region and suggest the risk of future conflict can be low. We use the best available data on protected area degradation to corroborate this level of risk. Together, our findings indicate that while conflicts between renewables and protected areas inevitably do occur, renewables represent an important option for decarbonization of the energy sector that would not significantly affect areabased conservation targets if deployed with appropriate policy and regulatory controls. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={The designation of large scale marine protected areas (MPAs) has increased in recent years to address global issues such as biodiversity loss and the conservation of vulnerable marine habitats. While designing a large scale MPAs in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Ascension Island, the monitoring and enforcement costs were estimated for the two options under consideration: partial closure or full closure of the EEZ for the international commercial fleet. It was found that number of licenses to be sold to the international fleet to allow them access to the EEZ of Ascension Island would need to be increased to fund the monitoring and enforcement cost in case of a partial closure of the EEZ of Ascension Island. In this study, the future economic viability of the licensed big eye tuna fishery was addressed. The study explored economic drivers thought to be linked to license sales. It was shown that cost of licenses had not caused the observed decline in license sales but a shift in consumer demand toward lighter tuna species resulted in a decrease in Japanese imports for bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). This change in demand led to global changes in fishing effort and a drop in demand for licenses to fish within the Ascension Island EEZ. This study provided a valuable insight into the economic viability of the bigeye tuna fishery within the Ascension Island EEZ which informed the subsequent decision to close the bigeye tuna fishery as part of the designation of an Ascension Island highly protected large-scale MPA.

abstract={Habitat alterations resulting from land-use change are major drivers of global biodiversity losses. In Africa, these threats are especially severe. For instance, demand to convert land into agricultural uses is leading to increasing areas of drylands in southern and central Africa being transformed for agriculture. In Zimbabwe, a land reform programme provided an opportunity to study the biodiversity response to abrupt habitat modification in part of a 91,000 ha dryland area of semi-natural savannah used since 1930 for low-level cattle ranching. Small-scale subsistence farms were created during 2001–2002 in 65,000 ha of this area, with ranching continuing in the remaining unchanged area. We measured the compositions of bird communities in farmed and ranched land over 8 years, commencing one decade after subsistence farms were established. Over the study period, repeated counts were made along the same 45 transects to assess species' population changes that may have resulted from trait-filtering responses to habitat disturbance. In 2012, avian species' richness was substantially higher (+8.8%) in the farmland bird community than in the unmodified ranched area. Temporal trends over the study period showed increased species' richness in the ranched area (+12.3%) and farmland (+6.8%). There were increased abundances in birds of most sizes, and in all feeding guilds. New species did not add new functional traits, and no species with distinctive traits were lost in either area. As a result, species' diversity reduced, and functional redundancy increased by 6.8% in ranched land. By 2020, two decades after part of the ranched savannah was converted into farmland, the compositions of the two bird communities had both changed and became more similar. The broadly benign impact on birds of land conversion into subsistence farms is attributed to the relatively low level of agricultural activity in the farmland and the large regional pool of nonspecialist bird species. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Deforestation in the tropics is mainly driven by the need to expand agriculture and forestry land. Tropical cropland has also undergone a process of intensification, particularly evident in regions that are the main exporters of deforestation-driven commodities. Around 25 million people in the world depend on coffee production, which has a profound contribution to global biodiversity loss through agricultural extensification and intensification. Nevertheless, coffee agroforestry systems have been postulated to serve as an alternative refuge for biodiversity across different regions. We aim to compare bird abundance, diversity, and richness in commercial polyculture coffee systems (i.e., the highest degree of habitat complexity that can be achieved in coffee fields after deforestation) with other coffee agroforestry systems and human modified habitats in Java, Indonesia. We collected data in 21 sites (1228 points) on Java from February to August 2021 using the point sampling method. Via generalised additive models, we tested whether the abundance, diversity, and richness of birds were different between different human modified habitats including other potential predictors such as elevation, distance to protected areas, shade tree richness, and plant diversity. Using the non-metric multidimensional scaling, we tested whether there was a difference in terms of the composition of foraging guilds between habitats. Commercial polyculture coffee fields can sustain levels of bird abundance, diversity, and richness comparable to agroforestry systems under natural forest, and higher than sun coffee and shaded monoculture coffee, and of other human modified habitats such as crop/fruit fields and tree farms. Coffee agroforestry systems have a higher proportion of nectarivores, insectivores, and frugivores than other systems that can sustain high diversity and richness of birds such as paddy fields that mainly have granivores and carnivores. Complex polycultures can represent an avenue for the future of sustainable agriculture in conditions where deforestation rates are high and in crops such as coffee, which maintain high yield in the presence of diverse shade. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Nonhuman primates are facing an impending extinction crisis with over 65% of species listed as Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered, and 93% characterized by declining populations. Primary drivers of primate population decline include deforestation, principally for industrial agriculture and the production of food and nonfood commodities, much of which is exported to wealthy consumer nations, unsustainable bushmeat hunting, the illegal pet trade, the capture of primates for body parts, expanding road and rail networks, mining, dam building, oil and gas exploration, and the threat of emerging diseases. Over the next several decades, human population increase, agricultural expansion, and climate change are expected to contribute significantly to the loss of additional suitable habitat and a reduction in the viability of local primate populations. If we are to avoid this impending extinction crisis, primate researchers must prioritize projects designed to mitigate the effects of habitat change on ecosystems health and biodiversity, and play a greater role in conservation and environmental policy by educating global citizens and political leaders. In addition, the international community will need to work with governments in primate habitat countries to expand the number of protected areas that contain primate species (94 primate species have < 10% of their range in protected areas). In this special issue of the International Journal of Primatology, we bring together researchers from a wide range of disciplines to examine the current and future threats to primate population persistence, and present local, country, and regional solutions to protect primate species. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In the context of rapid urbanization, urban foresters are actively seeking management monitoring programs that address the challenges of urban biodiversity loss. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has attracted attention because it allows for the collection of data passively, objectively, and continuously across large areas and for extended periods. However, it continues to be a difficult subject due to the massive amount of information that audio recordings contain. Most existing automated analysis methods have limitations in their application in urban areas, with unclear ecological relevance and efficacy. To better support urban forest biodiversity monitoring, we present a novel methodology for automatically extracting bird vocalizations from spectrograms of field audio recordings, integrating object-based classification. We applied this approach to acoustic data from an urban forest in Beijing and achieved an accuracy of 93.55% (±4.78%) in vocalization recognition while requiring less than 1/8 of the time needed for traditional inspection. The difference in efficiency would become more significant as the data size increases because object-based classification allows for batch processing of spectrograms. Using the extracted vocalizations, a series of acoustic and morphological features of bird-vocalization syllables (syllable feature metrics, SFMs) could be calculated to better quantify acoustic events and describe the soundscape. A significant correlation between the SFMs and biodiversity indices was found, with 57% of the variance in species richness, 41% in Shannon’s diversity index and 38% in Simpson’s diversity index being explained by SFMs. Therefore, our proposed method provides an effective complementary tool to existing automated methods for long-term urban forest biodiversity monitoring and conservation. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Context: Habitat loss and fragmentation are main drivers of biodiversity loss and are occurring at an accelerating rate globally. Carnivores are often subject to persecution and conflict with humans, typically reside in low densities and require large areas for core habitat and dispersal, which makes them especially vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Objectives: This paper identifies, maps and analyses habitat core areas and connectivity linkages for three mountain-residing carnivore species of high conservation importance in Iran: Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and Pallas’s cat (Otocolobus manul). Methods: We used ensemble habitat suitability modeling, and compared the accuracy of ensemble models with seven separate models based on AUC and TSS. We applied resistant kernel and factorial least-cost path analyses to identify population core areas and corridors across the full distributions of the three species in Iran. Results: Mean annual temperature, vegetation greenness (NDVI), and slope were among the most important predictor variables for all three species. We found ensemble modeling outcompeted all single-method models in terms of AUC. We found low overlap between predicted corridor locations of our modeled species with Protected Areas. Conclusions: Given the fragmented populations of our studied species in Iran, conserving them will require integrated landscape-level management to protect corridors and enhance connectivity, especially outside of Protected Areas. Optimized landscape management to conserve these species will likely promote conservation of montane landscapes and their inhabitants in Iran. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

Taxa: NZ lizards: diplodactylid geckos and eugongylinae skinks. Methods: We built correlative species distribution models (SDMs) for NZ geckos and skinks to estimate climatic suitability under current climate and 2070 future climate scenarios. We then used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models (BPMMs) to assess vulnerability for both groups with predictor variables for life-history traits (body size and activity phase) and current distribution (elevation and latitude). We explored two scenarios: an unlimited dispersal scenario, where projections track climate, and a no-dispersal scenario, where projections are restricted to areas currently identified as suitable. Results: SDMs projected vulnerability to climate change for most modelled lizards. For species' ranges projected to decline in climatically suitable areas, average decreases were between 42% and 46% for geckos and 33% and 52% for skinks, although area did increase or remain stable for a minority of species. For the no-dispersal scenario, the average decrease for geckos was 37%–52% and for skinks was 33%–52%. Our BPMMs showed phylogenetic signal in climate change vulnerability for both groups, with elevation increasing vulnerability for geckos, and body size reducing vulnerability for skinks. Main conclusions: New Zealand lizards showed variable vulnerability to climate change, with most species' ranges predicted to decrease. For species whose suitable climatic space is projected to disappear from within their current range, managed relocation could be considered to establish populations in regions that will be suitable under future climates. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The current study provides valuable insight into the ecological risks and decline of the bivalve fishery and biodiversity in the Amvrakikos Gulf over the last 50 years through a triangulation of information from in situ surveys and expert judgment, supplemented with historical archives. In situ sampling showed that bivalve species composition was a typical composition of benthic fauna consisting of the olive green cockle, Cerastoderma glaucum, the grooved carpet shell, Ruditapes decussatus, and the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis. Interviews confirmed the dramatic decrease in the abundance of striped venus clam, Chamelea gallina, and noble pen shell Pinna nobilis, both of which might be attributed to human-induced impacts, habitat degradation and climate change. Official data depicted a gradual reduction of bivalve catches since 1980 and massive degradation of the resources after 2000. As a result, the bivalve fishery was abandoned, having a negative impact on the local socio-economic community. The present study fills in a gap in knowledge for preserving species biodiversity that is critical to the health of the coastal environments. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Biodiversity loss, exotic plant invasion and climatic change are three important global changes that can affect litter decomposition. These effects may be interactive and these global changes thus need to be considered simultaneously. Here, we assembled herbaceous plant communities with five species richness levels (1, 2, 4, 8 or 16) and subjected them to a drought treatment (no, moderate or intensive drought) that was factorially combined with an invasion treatment (presence or absence of the non-native Symphyotrichum subulatum). We collected litter of these plant communities and let it decompose for 9 months in the plant communities from which it originated. Drought decreased litter decomposition, while invasion by S. subulatum had little impact. Increasing species richness decreased litter decomposition except under intensive drought. A structural equation model showed that drought and species richness affected litter decomposition indirectly through changes in litter nitrogen concentration rather than by altering quantity and diversity of soil meso-fauna or soil physico-chemical properties. The slowed litter decomposition under high species diversity originated from a sampling effect, specifically from low litter nitrogen concentrations in the two dominant species. We conclude that effects on litter decomposition rates that are mediated by changing concentrations of the limiting nutrient in litter need to be considered when predicting effects of global changes such as plant diversity loss. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Biodiversity loss is a global problem, accelerated by human-induced pressures. In the marine realm, one of the major threats to species conservation, together with climate change, is overfishing. In this context, having information on the conservation status of target commercial marine fish species becomes crucial for assuring safe standards. We put together fisheries statistics from the FAO, the IUCN Red List, FishBase, and RAM Legacy databases to understand to what extent top commercial species’ conservation status has been assessed. Levels of assessment for top-fished species were higher than those for general commercial or highly commercial species, but almost half of the species have outdated assessments. We found no relation between IUCN Red List traits and FishBase Vulnerability Index, depreciating the latter value as a guidance for extinction threat. The RAM database suggests good management of more-threatened species in recent decades, but more data are required to assess whether the trend has reverted in recent years. Outdated IUCN Red List assessments can benefit from reputed stock assessments for new reassessments. The future of IUCN Red List evaluations for commercial fish species relies on integrating new parameters from fisheries sources and improved collaboration with fisheries stakeholders and managers. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Biological invasions are a major driver of biodiversity loss and socioeconomic burden globally. As invasion rates accelerate worldwide, understanding past invasion dynamics is essential to inform predictions of future invaders and impacts. Owing to a high diversity of pathways and current biosecurity gaps, aquatic systems near urban centres are especially susceptible to alien species establishments. Here, we compiled and compared alien species lists for three different aquatic recipient regions spanning the North Atlantic: Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River and North and Baltic Seas. Each system is a major trade centre, with a history of invasions, and characterized by a strong natural salinity gradient. Our goal was to compare the alien species across systems, to test for similarities in the taxonomic composition and geographic origin as well as species overlap among the three regions. We selected specific macroinvertebrate, algal and fish taxa for analysis, to control for uneven taxonomic and biogeographic resolution across regions. Cumulatively, we identified 326 individual alien species established in these aquatic systems, with the North and Baltic Seas most invaded overall (163), followed by Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River (84) and Chesapeake Bay (79). Most invasions were from Ponto-Caspian, Eurasian, Northwest Pacific, Northwest Atlantic and North American origins, and mostly comprised Arthropoda, Chordata, Mollusca and Annelida. However, origins and taxonomies differed significantly among destinations, with Ponto-Caspian species particularly successful invaders to the North and Baltic Seas then Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River, but less so to Chesapeake Bay. Nevertheless, approximately eight-tenths of invaders established in only one region, indicating disparate invasion patterns and a high potential for future aliens to accrue from increasingly diverse source pools and pathways. These results support biosecurity strategies that consider a broad range of geographic origins and taxonomic groups to limit the translocation, arrival and spread of alien species worldwide. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Cities are seen as quintessentially human; however, because they can offer viable habitat to many plants, animals and other forms of life, cities are also dynamic ecosystems. As urban areas expand to house more of the global human population and reduce natural habitat for wildlife, the need for wildlife-inclusive urban planning and design becomes increasingly pressing. The 2019 Urban Wildlife Information Network Summit responded to this need by connecting a group of 80 scientists, urban planners and designers to examine the role of cities in combating the global biodiversity crisis. The Summit focused on identifying and addressing barriers to transdisciplinary work between these communities, such as disciplinary silos, varying incentive structures, funding, differences in spatio-temporal scale, existing infrastructure and values and bias. We explore the challenges to network building for wildlife-inclusive design and planning revealed by the Summit and offer potential solutions for overcoming these obstacles for more effective collaboration around wildlife-inclusive cities.

funding_text 2={First and foremost, architects, planners and scientists must avoid competing for funding and resources must be available to encourage a transdisciplinary project team model. Some major funding organizations are now turning their attention to collaborative research. For example, the United States National Science Foundation's transformative research agenda prioritizes convergence research—research using the expertise and methods from diverse disciplines—through their Sustainable Urban Systems Program and 10 ‘Big Ideas’ guiding future funding efforts (NSF, 2020 ). Though this model still prioritizes research over application, it is a good first step toward collaboration across the research, planning and design professions. Additionally, partnering across disciplines may open up previously unavailable pools of funding. For instance, architects and planners can partner with universities and other research institutions to apply for research‐based grants, or researchers might partner with a municipal planning agency to propose local tax and bond initiatives. Transdisciplinary professional partnerships, as well as funding organizations prioritizing sharing of pertinent questions, goals and methods across disciplines, will effectively increase the reach and relevance of wildlife‐inclusive scholarship, design and policy.},

abstract={Changes in soil carbon (C) sequestration in grassland ecosystems have important impacts on the global C cycle. As such, it is important that researchers better understand the underlying mechanisms affecting soil C. Increasing evidence has shown that atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition can cause dramatic changes in grassland soil C. It remains unclear whether herbivore grazing, a primary means to manage and utilize grassland resources, can regulate the effects of N deposition on soil C, and whether these effects are dependent on plant community diversity. Here, we examined the joint effects of herbivore grazing and N-addition on soil organic C (SOC) stocks in two types of communities with low and high plant diversity respectively. Our results showed that the effects of N-addition and its combination with herbivore grazing on grassland SOC were inconsistent in the two types of communities. In the low-diversity community, N-addition greatly decreased SOC stocks, while grazing significantly increased it. Additionally, the grazing-induced increase in soil C stocks in the presence of N-addition was so great that it completely counteracted the significant decline in SOC induced by N-addition. However, in the high-diversity community, we observed no effects of N-addition on SOC and grazing increased SOC only in the absence of N-addition and had no significant effect in the presence of N-addition. Synthesis and applications. Our study suggests that increased N deposition can trigger a remarkable reduction in soil C sequestration in grasslands with low plant diversity, but that herbivore grazing can offset this decline, which may help to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions caused by atmospheric N deposition. As a result, we suggest that moderate herbivore grazing should be considered as an effective grassland management measure for maintaining and improving grassland soil C sequestration as the increasing global changes such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, N deposition and biodiversity losses threat. © 2021 British Ecological Society},

abstract={Biodiversity directly influences the delivery of multiple ecosystem services, most notably within agriculture. Projected future global demands for food, fiber and bioenergy will require enhancement of agricultural productivity, but favoring biodiversity-based ecosystem services generally remains underutilized in agricultural practice. In addition, agricultural intensification is a key driver of biodiversity loss. A significant obstacle preventing the adoption of ecologically sensitive practices is a lack of knowledge of the species delivering the services. Insectivorous bats have long been suggested to regulate insect pest populations and may be a critical component of biodiversity-based ecosystem services. Bats may also serve as agents of insect pest surveillance through environmental DNA (eDNA) monitoring approaches. However, the biological and economic importance of bats to agriculture remains under-quantified. Here we catalogued the dietary niche of two North American bats, little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) and big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), through DNA metabarcoding of guano collected from seven roosting sites over a 26-week period. We measured the frequency of occurrence of known pest species in guano samples, compared interspecific differences in diet, and examined seasonal patterns in prey selection. Overall, we detected 653 unique prey species, 160 of which were known agricultural pests or disease vectors. Species diversity of prey species consumed varied by bat species and across the season, with big brown bats accounting for the majority of arthropod diversity detected. However, little brown bats consumed relatively more aquatic insects than big brown bats, suggesting that increased bat species richness in a landscape can amplify their net pest regulation service. Further, we hypothesized that detection probabilities of target insect pests would be higher in guano samples than in conventional survey methods. Multi-survey occupancy modeling revealed significantly lower detectability in bat guano than in conventional monitoring traps, however, highlighting important tradeoffs in selection of survey methods. Overall, the results presented here contribute to a growing evidence base supporting the role bats play in the provisioning of biodiversity-based ecosystem services. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Primates are facing a global extinction crisis driven by an expanding human population, environmental degradation, the conversion of tropical forests into monocultures for industrial agriculture and cattle ranching, unsustainable resource extraction, hunting, climate change, and the threat of emerging zoonotic diseases. And, although many primate scientists have dedicated their careers to conservation, 65% of primate species are listed as Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered, and >75% are experiencing a population decline. Projections indicate that by the end of the century, an additional 75% of the area currently occupied by wild primates will be lost to agriculture. Clearly, we are losing the battle and must change business-as-usual if we are to protect wild primates and their habitats. This article is a call to action. Primate societies and their membership need to expand their engagement in scientific advocacy and scientific activism designed to educate, inspire, organize, and mobilize global citizens to join together, lobby business leaders and politicians in both primate habitat countries and in consumer nations, boycott forest-risk products, participate in demonstrations and letter writing campaigns, and use social media to effect transformational change. We are the experts, and the more we and our professional organizations drive the public policy debate on wildlife conservation and environmental justice, the more successful we will be in protecting the world’s primates from extinction.

abstract={The late Quaternary in North America was marked by highly variable climate and considerable biodiversity loss including a megafaunal extinction event at the terminal Pleistocene. Here, we focus on changes in body size and diet in Neotoma (woodrats) in response to these ecological perturbations using the fossil record from the Edwards Plateau (Texas) across the past 20,000 years. Body mass was estimated using measurements of fossil teeth and diet was quantified using stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen from fossil bone collagen. Prior to ca. 7000 cal yr BP, maximum mass was positively correlated to precipitation and negatively correlated to temperature. Independently, mass was negatively correlated to community composition, becoming more similar to modern over time. Neotoma diet in the Pleistocene was primarily sourced from C3 plants, but became progressively more reliant on C4 (and potentially CAM) plants through the Holocene. Decreasing population mass and higher C4/CAM consumption was associated with a transition from a mesic to xeric landscape. Our results suggest that Neotoma responded to climatic variability during the terminal Pleistocene through changes in body size, while changes in resource availability during the Holocene likely led to shifts in the relative abundance of different Neotoma species in the community.

abstract={The ongoing contemporary biodiversity crisis may result in much of ocean’s biodiversity to be lost or deeply modified without even being known. As the climate and anthropogenic-related impacts on marine systems accelerate, biodiversity knowledge integration is urgently required to evaluate and monitor marine ecosystems and to support suitable responses to underpin a sustainable future. The Census of Marine Life (CoML, 2000–2010) was the largest global research program on marine biodiversity. A decade after, and coinciding with the steep increase of digitalization of our society, we review existing findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) biodiversity data coming from one of the most reliable online information systems: the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). We evaluate the completeness of available datasets with respect to the CoML benchmark, along with progresses in understanding spatial–temporal patterns of marine biodiversity in the European Seas in the last decades. Overall, we observe severe biases in available biodiversity data toward the north-western marine regions (particularly around the United Kingdom and the North Sea), the most recent years (with a peak in the number of reported occurrences in the 2010s) and the most conspicuous, abundant, and likely “appealing” taxa (e.g., crustaceans, echinoderms or fish). These biases may hamper research applications, but also global-scale data needs and integrative assessments required to support cost-effective progresses toward global biodiversity conservation. National to international joint efforts aimed at enhancing data acquisition and mobilization from poorly known regions, periods, and taxa are desirable if we aim to address these potential biases for the effective monitoring of marine ecosystems and the evaluation of ongoing impacts on biogeographic patterns and ecosystem functioning and services.

abstract={In areas where farmland borders protected areas, wildlife may be attracted to crops and cause substantial financial damage for farmers. Elephants, in particular, can destroy a year's harvest in a single night, and can also cause damage to buildings and other farm structures. Few studies have examined whether damage caused by wild elephants increases social inequalities in farmer communities. We interviewed settlement leaders and subsistence rice farmers living in the buffer zone of Bardiya National Park, Nepal, to examine (1) the variation and spatial distribution of wealth within the farmer community, (2) the severity and spatio-temporal distribution of damage inflicted by Asian elephants Elephas maximus, and (3) the willingness to insure against such damage. We investigated whether particular societal strata are disproportionally affected by negative interactions with elephants. We found that farmers near the boundary between agricultural and wilderness areas were significantly poorer and had smaller landholdings than those further into the cultivated lands. Concomitantly, damage to crops and houses was more frequent nearer the wilderness-agriculture boundary than further away from it. Hence, in the buffer zone of Bardiya National Park, farmers near the wilderness-cultivation boundary, with small landholdings, had a relatively higher cost of elephant damage, yet were less willing to pay for an insurance scheme. We infer that in areas where both social inequality and damage caused by wildlife are spatially structured, conservation success may cause economic hardship for the local community, particularly for the poorer class. We discuss causes of the current lack of communal mitigation measures against the damage caused by elephants in the Park, and potential solutions. © The Author(s), 2021.

abstract={Urban expansion is a pervasive driver of biodiversity loss. To understand the effects of urbanization on diversity, we investigated the response of bird taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity to urban green spaces’ characteristics in thirty-one green spaces of Mexico City. Selected sites encompassed variation of environmental factors along a transformation gradient, from natural protected areas to landscaped parks. Bird observations were conducted during winter (non-breeding season), spring (dry breeding season), and summer (wet breeding season). We used multi-model inference to assess the relationship of green space area, shape, isolation, tree richness, habitat diversity, and vegetation cover with species richness, Faith’s phylogenetic diversity, and functional richness. We calculated standardized effect sizes from null models to assess phylogenetic and functional structure. We registered 91 species belonging to 28 families across all sites and seasons. The number of detected species was largest in winter and decreased toward the dry breeding season, and then toward the wet breeding season. We found a moderate to strong positive relationship of species richness with phylogenetic diversity and functional richness. Overall, phylogenetic and functional structure of bird communities in green spaces was neither clustered nor over-dispersed. However, few cases of functional clustering, phylogenetic clustering, or both were observed, and they corresponded to natural protected areas. Results showed a predominant role of green space area in determining community diversity and phylogenetic structure while it did not influence functional structure. Contrary to our predictions, habitat diversity had a negative effect on species richness and phylogenetic diversity and this effect was detected only during the wet breeding season, whereas isolation showed a positive relationship with phylogenetic and functional structure, during the wet breeding season and winter, respectively. This study emphasizes the use of complementary measures of diversity together with the comparison between observed and expected values to get a better insight into the mechanisms by which green spaces’ characteristics affect bird diversity across the seasons.

abstract={Conservation will always fail when it does not address the drivers of biodiversity loss, which in many cases involves understanding human behaviours and the attitudes that underlie them. The saltwater crocodile Crocodylus porosus is a keystone species in mangrove wetlands but also a dangerous predator that affects people's safety and livelihoods. Although saltwater crocodiles are protected under the Myanmar Biodiversity and Protected Area Law, the government has not integrated local people's attitudes into conservation and management. As a consequence, saltwater crocodiles, although categorized as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, are restricted to a single protected area, Meinmahlakyun Wildlife Sanctuary, in Myanmar. To examine local attitudes towards the species, we investigated local knowledge about the environment, crocodiles, habitats and threats, awareness of human-crocodile conflict, and perceptions of the benefits and impacts of saltwater crocodile conservation through questionnaires in 244 households in 17 villages. We found that people were highly knowledgeable about the local environment, saltwater crocodiles, and their habitats. People with seasonal livelihoods that rely on natural resources from Meinmahlakyun had negative attitudes towards crocodile conservation. People were likely to have negative attitudes if they perceived there were no benefits from conserving the species. Law enforcement through restricting resource access does not enhance conservation success and builds resentment towards the conservation of the species. Local people suggested that, as a basis for management, understanding risks posed by crocodiles was the best approach to facilitate human-crocodile coexistence in the Ayeyarwady delta region. © The Author(s), 2020.

abstract={Freshwaters represent the most threatened environments with regard to biodiversity loss and, therefore, there is a need for national monitoring programs to effectively document species distribution and evaluate potential risks for vulnerable species. The monitoring of species for effective management practices is, however, challenged by insufficient data acquisition when using traditional methods. Here we present the application of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of amphibians in combination with quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for an invasive pathogenic chytrid species (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis -Bd), a potential threat to endemic and endangered amphibian species. Statistical comparison of amphibian species detection using either traditional or eDNA-based approaches showed weak correspondence. By tracking the distribution of Bd over three years, we concluded that the risk for amphibian extinction is low since Bd was only detected at five sites where multiple amphibians were present over the sampled years. Our results show that eDNA-based detection can be used for simultaneous monitoring of amphibian diversity and the presence of amphibian pathogens at the national level in order to assess potential species extinction risks and establish effective management practices. As such our study represents suggestions for a national monitoring program based on eDNA. © 2022 The Authors. Published by IASE.},

abstract={Biodiversity is globally under pressure, and the current decline in insect biomass and diversity is likely caused by human activities. Key drivers of biodiversity loss include agricultural intensification and anthropogenic climate change. Nevertheless, a thorough understanding of potential interactions between both factors and the mechanisms underlying insect declines, in general, is still lacking. Here, the authors investigate the combined effects of nitrogen fertilisation and drought, as applied to host plants, on the preference and performance of the butterfly Lycaena tityrus. Individuals performed best on plants having received medium nitrogen levels, while performance was reduced by either a lack of or strong fertilisation, the former potentially caused by nitrogen limitation and the latter by increased concentrations of toxic allelochemicals. Female oviposition preference though was positively related to nitrogen fertilisation, resulting in a mismatch between preference and offspring performance at high nitrogen levels. Plant drought stress additionally reduced herbivore performance, and females appeared to suffer more from low-quality food than males. Our results indicate that increasing nitrogen fertilisation, as applied in intensive agriculture, may substantially reduce host-plant quality for insect herbivores, which may be exaggerated in the course of climate change due to the more frequent occurrence of droughts. Our study thus contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying human-driven insect declines in agricultural landscapes and beyond. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={University campuses contribute substantially to urban green and blue infrastructure and are habitats for biodiversity in urban environments. Higher education institutions bear responsibility to conserve biodiversity and enhance the ecological value of their green and blue spaces, thereby educating about the importance of biodiversity in a sustainable society.This paper is a retrospective formative evaluation charting Intervarsity BioBlitz (a cross-institutional biodiversity recording competition) in higher education institutes in Ireland. Intervarsity BioBlitz enabled academic institutions to form and monitor biodiversity inventories for green and blue spaces on campus, map records into GIS layers, and promote campus biodiversity with the student body and management. Intervarsity BioBlitz offered an engaging and interactive means of quantifying campus biodiversity while also educating staff, students, and the wider community about biodiversity and connecting them to nature. It became a valuable tool for sustainability reporting in the higher education institution sector contributing to national and international biodiversity monitoring. Embedding Intervarsity BioBlitz with existing sustainability initiatives further enhanced performance and informed the delivery of action plans. Higher education institutes need to teach survey and identification skills, facilitate interest, awareness, and action to protect biodiversity. Biodiversity needs to become more prominent in international higher education sustainability metrics if we are to adequately address the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss. © The Authors IL.},

abstract={Desertification is a serious ecological problem leading to significant biodiversity loss, but how desertification drives shifts in life history and fitness of animals remains understudied. To clarify whether habitat desertification causes shifts in life history strategies, we compared ecological factors and reproductive traits of Phr ynocephalus przewalskii from three different desertification habitats – fixed dune, semi-fixed dune and mobile dune of a semi-arid region of Inner Mongolia, at the eastern edge of Hobq Desert, China. Our results showed a significant shift in the egg size-number trade-off of P. przewalskii in response to desertification, with lizards from the mobile dune habitat producing smaller clutches of larger eggs than lizards from the fixed and semi-fixed dune habitats. This life history shift is likely adaptive and driven by abiotic factors (temperature and precipitation) rather than biotic factors (food availability and lizard population density). Our study demonstrates that habitat desertification drives the shift in egg size-number trade-off in a lizard and highlights the importance of exploring the life history responses of animals to habitat desertification as well as to other traditionally well-studied factors like temperature, especially in the context of future global climate change. © 2022, Asiatic Herpetological Research Society.

abstract={In Brazil, roadkill of wild animals represents an important part of the local biodiversity loss. Even so, studies focused on road ecology are still very scarce for many regions of the country. The present study aimed to monitor the mortality of wild vertebrates on the Federal Highway BR-235, in Sergipe (Brazil), and analyze possible seasonal variations in roadkill rates. Between August 2020 and July 2021, two samples were taken per month in a stretch of 20 km of the BR-235, traveled by motorcycle at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h. Seventy-five individuals of 30 vertebrate species were recorded. The roadkill rate was 0.156 individuals per kilometer covered. The most recorded classes were birds with 29 individuals (13 spp.) and mammals with 23 individuals (10 spp.). The species with the highest number of records was Rhinella sp. with 16 records (21.6%), Coragyps atratus with eight records (10.8%) and Didelphis albiventris with seven records (9.4%). Among the species recorded, two are threatened with extinction (Leopardus tigrinus and Puma yagouaroundi). A greater number of roadkill was registered in the rainy season. The results reveal this stretch of BR-235 as a source of continuous mortality for the region’s fauna. © 2022, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. All rights reserved.},

We argue that analyses of drivers and dynamics of IWT within Europe must evaluate the overlooked interconnections between legal and illegal trades. In this brief commentary, we develop a new conceptual lens that brings together cutting-edge theories of political ecology and green criminology. We apply this to the European IWT context, to deconstruct the power dynamics and inequalities that underlie environmental harms caused by green-collar crime. We use the dynamics of illegal trade in brown bears, eels and songbirds as illustrative examples, and consider three cross-cutting issues that shape the trade: consumption, uncertain scientific knowledge and legislative frameworks. © 2022 The Author(s).

abstract={Invasive species are considered one of the main drivers of the sixth mass extinction. Conservation solutions depend on whether a species is also indigenous to the country it invades (i.e., beyond its native range). In the case of invasive cryptic species, genetic tools are required to establish their identity. We illustrate these issues with the human-mediated colonization of the Dutch coastal dunes by Hyla tree frogs. Although previously assumed to concern the indigenous common tree frog H. arborea, European tree frogs comprise a complex of allopatric cryptic species, meaning the taxonomic identity of introduced Dutch populations warrants investigation. We sequence mtDNA for 173 individuals from native and introduced populations across the Netherlands and compare our dataset with hundreds of Hyla haplotypes previously barcoded in the Western Palearctic. Two of the dune populations carry an mtDNA haplotype of the native species H. arborea that occurs naturally elsewhere in the Netherlands. In contrast, mtDNA assigned to the eastern tree frog H. orientalis was detected in all three other dune populations. In one of these populations mtDNA of the Italian tree frog H. intermedia was also found. Not one, but three species of tree frogs have thus been introduced to the Dutch coastal dunes, only one of them being native to the Netherlands. This situation causes a conservation conundrum as some introduced populations are lawfully protected but could pose a threat to local biodiversity. Regarding the â trueâ exotic tree frog species, all conservation options should be considered. © 2022 Copyright 2022 by Kuijt et al.},

abstract={Context: Invasive predators are major drivers of global biodiversity loss. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and feral cats (Felis catus) have contributed to the decline and extinction of many native species in Australia. The deployment of poison baits to control fox populations is a widespread conservation tool, but the effects of baiting intensity, rainfall and prey abundance on baiting effectiveness remain poorly understood. Aims: We aimed to understand what influences the association between fox baiting intensity, red fox activity and feral cat activity, to provide inferences about what might affect the effectiveness of fox baiting in reducing fox activity. Methods: We used generalised linear models to assess how fox and cat activity changes in relation to fox baiting intensity, rainfall, native prey availability and distance to agricultural land over a 6-year period (2006-13) in the forest ecosystems of the Upper Warren region of south-western Australia. Key results: We found that fox activity was negatively associated with rainfall in the previous 12 months and positively associated with prey abundance and fox baiting intensity. We also found an interaction between fox baiting and prey abundance, with fox activity increasing with prey activity in areas of low and moderate baiting intensity, but remaining constant in areas of high baiting intensity. Feral cat activity was positively associated with prey abundance and fox baiting intensity. We found no clear relationship between fox and cat activity. Conclusions: The drivers of the association between fox baiting and fox activity are unclear because intense fox baiting was targeted at areas of known high fox abundance. However, our results indicate that intense fox baiting may be effective at decoupling the positive association between fox activity and prey abundance. Our results also suggest a positive association between fox baiting intensity and feral cat activity, thus supporting the case for integrated fox and cat management. Implications: We caution interpretation of our results, but note that management of invasive predators could be improved by adjusting the intensity of management in response to changes in environmental conditions and local context (e.g. strategically conducting intense predator management where prey abundance is highest). Improved understanding of these associations requires a monitoring program with sufficient replication and statistical power to detect any treatment effects. © 2022 CSIRO. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Context: Habitat loss and fragmentation are key drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide, yet the influence of landscape structure on species distributions is unknown. Globally, reptiles are thought to be especially sensitive to landscape modification due to their limited capacity for dispersal and reliance on native vegetation. New knowledge of how landscape structure influences species distributions is needed to inform conservation strategies. Aims: Our principal aim was to examine the influence of landscape structure on the distributions of 40 terrestrial reptile species in Victoria, southeast Australia. Methods: We obtained species occurrence records from the Victorian Biodiversity Atlas, and used MaxEnt to model the distributions of reptile species within Victoria using biophysical and landscape structure variables. A moving window analysis was applied to a land cover map to derive five landscape structure metrics; two metrics represented landscape cover and three represented landscape configuration. Key results: Climate variables were generally found to be the strongest drivers of species distributions, although 80% of reptile species were also influenced by landscape structure (permutation importance ≥5%). Of the five landscape structure variables, extent of native vegetation had the greatest influence (30 of 40 species), followed by habitat shape. For Lerista bougainvillii and Tiliqua rugosa, native vegetation cover had a greater influence on their distributions than climate variables. Most species responded positively to native vegetation extent, whereas responses to other landscape structure variables were varied. Conclusions: Although most studies of reptile distributions only use biophysical variables in modelling, our research shows that at the scale of our study area, reptile species distributions were also influenced by landscape structure; extent of native vegetation was an important predictor for most species. Integrating landscape structure in modelling has the potential to improve our ability to predict species distributions. Implications: Because species distributions are likely to shift due to climate change, knowledge of the influence of landscape structure on distributions will help land managers to facilitate successful range expansions in fragmented landscapes. Our findings indicate that management focused on increasing the extent of native vegetation is likely to provide benefit to most reptile species. © 2022 CSIRO. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Both anthropogenic actions and abiotic parameters, such as rainfall, temperature and photoperiod, can affect fruit and flower availability for animals, which consequently affects nutritional status and thus animals’ health. Herein, we investigated whether abiotic factors are related to changes in fruit availability that can lead to changes in feeding behavior and, consequently, in endoparasite load and general health status in two groups of golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) living in degraded fragments of Atlantic forest in Southern Bahia, Brazil. We detected that there was a high variation in availability of ripe fruits throughout the year, with lower availability occurring at the end of spring and beginning of summer. Despite this, there was no difference in tamarins’ general health status, body mass and blood counts between seasons. This is probably because during native fruit scarcity, the tamarins eat cultivated species, such as banana (Musa spp.) and jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus). Temperature and daylength were negatively correlated with golden-headed lion tamarin endoparasite loads. Contrary to our expectations, endoparasite loads are not linked to fruit scarcity and consequent changes in feeding behavior. Nevertheless, we found higher parasite diversity in the group of golden-headed lion tamarins that occupied the smallest home range. The smaller the area available, the greater the contact with parasites the animal will have, as they are forced to travel constantly along the same routes in the forest, increasing infection risk and re-infection rates. Our results highlight how animals’ health is associated with environmental health as well as the need for constant monitoring to ensure the effective conservation of endangered species, such as the golden-headed lion tamarin. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

abstract={‘Biodiversity offsetting’ aims to address the residual negative environmental impacts of human development. It’s goal is to achieve No Net Loss (NNL), and preferably a Net Gain of biodiversity attributes between development and offset sites. Biodiversity offsetting suffers from a lack of ‘proof of concept’, as little work has been done to critically test the ecological efficacy of offsetting practices. Offsetting of stream ecological functions was investigated in Aotearoa New Zealand, via review of regulatory documentation for 76 offsets and field assessments of 14 offset sites. Field results indicated some functions, including fish passage connectivity, respond rapidly post-offset enhancement whilst others exhibit recovery lags (such as fish spawning habitat provision). However, most offsets were considered unlikely to achieve NNL due to failures in practice and process. Factors included inadequate consideration for restoration uncertainty, inappropriate monitoring conditions, insufficient data and inequivalent trade-offs. Key linkages between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, particularly regarding floodplain connectivity, were poorly considered in offset implementation. Thus, development may be occurring based on inadequate regulatory processes, and poorly evaluated ecological outcomes. These findings join a growing body of evidence which indicates that, in the context of a global biodiversity crisis, offsetting is not achieving its purpose of NNL. © 2022 The Royal Society of New Zealand.},

abstract={Amphibian biodiversity loss in recent years has exceeded that of all other groups of vertebrates. In this context, biodiversity hotspots represent priority targets for conservation in amphibian populations. However, little information is available on the distribution and conservation status of amphibian species within most biodiversity hotspots. Here, we characterized the distribution and conservation status of four threatened endemic amphibians (Bombina pachypus, Salamandra salamandra gigliolii, Salamandrina terdigitata, and Rana italica) in the Aspromonte Mountain region, a biodiversity hotspot in southern Italy where the conservation status of amphibians is almost unexplored. We conducted an intensive field survey of 507 potential breeding sites spanning over 2,326 km2. We found that all four species were widespread in the study area. We observed 337 species occurrences: 63 for S. s. gigliolii, 29 for S. terdigitata, 84 for B. pachypus, and 161 for R. italica. Species distribution analysis revealed that S. s. gigliolii and R. italica populations had an extended and homogenous distribution. Conversely, S. terdigitata showed a dispersed pattern, with long distances among breeding sites, and B. pachypus an aggregated pattern, associated with the availability of suitable artificial habitats. On the other hand, we reported a decrease in B. pachypus occurrence in its natural habitats, which reflects a negative trend of its populations. Overall, our results provide an encouraging framework for the conservation of amphibian populations in this area, but highlight the low coverage of threatened amphibian populations in protected areas, highlighting the need for a reassessment of conservation policies and spatial conservation planning for the Aspromonte region.

abstract={R ecent studies have described a direct relationship between the illegal wildlife trade (IWT) and the prevalence of zoonotic pathogens in human populations. In the Philippines, the Philippine Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (PIDSR) framework outlines the monitoring, response, and management of disease outbreaks, but needs to be updated in the wake of zoonoses from IWT. Here, we identified zoonotic pathogens that may be introduced to human populations through the IWT, pinpointed potential outbreak hotspots, and provided recommendations on how to improve the Philippines’ public health response while considering One Health. Using seizure data from the Biodiversity Management Bureau (DENR-BMB) covering the period from 2010 to 2016, we found that birds (32.3% of volume) and reptiles (63.3% of volume) were the most frequently seized by law enforcement in terms of incidence and volume. About 54% of seized wildlife could potentially host zoonotic pathogens with bacteria (78.3%), protozoa (34.8%), and viruses (27.5%) being the most represented pathogen groups. Three cities in Metro Manila together accounted for 30% of all seizures in the country followed by Palawan province which accounted for about 28% of seizures. Of the twelve epidemic prone diseases identified in the PIDSR, five diseases were found to have causative agents that could potentially be hosted by the traded wildlife. These findings will not only enhance the approach to surveillance in the PIDSR but will also aid in identifying opportunities to improve policies on agriculture and food security, public health and disease surveillance, and biodiversity conservation. © 2022, Philippine-American Academy of Science and Engineering.

abstract={Over the past few decades, several investigations around the globe have reported alarming declines in the abundance and diversity of bee species. The success of effective conservation strategies targeting these important pollinators relies heavily on accurate biodiversity assessments. The shortage of taxonomic experts and the escalation of the ongoing biodiversity crisis call for the development of alternative identification tools to implement efficient monitoring programs. The validation of such techniques is crucial to ensure that they provide results comparable to those of traditional morphotaxonomy. Here we performed two double-blind experiments to evaluate the accuracy of a pair of new techniques used for wild bee identification: DNA metabarcoding and in vivo identification in the field. The methods were tested on sets of wild bees from Germany and their results compared against evaluations done by panels of bee experts using traditional morphotaxonomy. On average the congruency of species identification between metabarcoding and morphotaxonomy was 88.98% across samples (N = 10), while in vivo identification and morphotaxonomy were 91.81% congruent (N = 7) for bees considered feasible for in vivo identification in the field. Traditional morphotaxonomy showed similar congruencies when compared to itself: 93.65% in the metabarcoding study and 92.96% in the in vivo study. Overall, these results support both new methods as viable alternatives to traditional microscopy-based assessment, with neither method being error-free. Metabarcoding provides a suitable option to analyze large numbers of specimens in the absence of highly trained taxonomic experts, while in vivo identification is recommended for repeated long-term monitoring, and when working in areas where the sampling of individuals could threaten local populations of endangered wild bee species. Further research is still needed to explore the potential of both techniques for conservation management and wildlife monitoring, as well as to overcome their current limitations as taxonomic tools. © 2022 Pensoft Publishers.

abstract={While a few species may thrive in urban areas, urban expansion is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Columbids such as feral Rock Doves (Columba livia domestica) and Common Woodpigeon (Columba palumbus) have adapted extremely well to the urban environment in Europe and beyond, but the Stock Dove (Columba oenas), a bird of farmland and woodland edge in the UK and of national conservation concern, is encountered infrequently in urban areas. Here we explore the multi-scale landscape associations of the little-studied Stock Dove within the urban matrix of Greater Manchester, UK, in order to identify its habitat requirements. We built a pilot model from historical citizen science records to identify potentially occupied sites within the city, and then surveyed these sites for Stock Dove during Spring 2019. We combined the survey results with citizen science records from the same period and described the habitat and landscape characteristics of sites occupied by Stock Dove using four variables at different scales plus twelve unscaled variables. We used a three-stage random forest approach to identify a subset of these variables for interpretation and a subset for prediction for the presence of Stock Dove within these sites. Key variables for predicting Stock Dove presence were their relative abundance in the landscape immediately beyond the core urban area, the greenness (NDVI) of the environment around sites, and the canopy cover of individual trees over 20 m high within sites. Stock Doves tended to be associated with habitats with more surface water during the non-breeding season than the breeding season. Our results highlight the importance of large trees within urban greenspace for this cavity-nesting species, softer boundaries around urban sites for Stock Doves and stock dove presence in nearby areas. While Stock Dove share many traits with species that are successful in the urban environment, they remain relatively poor urban adapters. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Wildlife tourism could address some of these issues, but instead it is exacerbated by social-ecological challenges and various levels of hierarchical injustices. The SDGs were intended to facilitate solutions to these global problems. Yet, they do not address the fundamental underpinnings of the anthropocentric injustices exacerbating these systemic challenges, in part because they were generated via the hegemonic processes that allow for these injustices to continue. Using a transdisciplinary intersectional ecofeminist approach to analyze the SDGs, we propose a theory that adopts a posthuman ethic—Wildlife Equity as a foundation to guide principles and apply to policies that rigorously illuminate the continued injustices that are driving the decline of livelihoods for all sentient beings on Earth. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Background: The biodiversity crisis and increasing impact of wildlife disease on animal and human health provides impetus for studying immune genes in wildlife. Despite the recent boom in genomes for wildlife species, immune genes are poorly annotated in nonmodel species owing to their high level of polymorphism and complex genomic organisation. Our research over the past decade and a half on Tasmanian devils and koalas highlights the importance of genomics and accurate immune annotations to investigate disease in wildlife. Given this, we have increasingly been asked the minimum levels of genome quality required to effectively annotate immune genes in order to study immunogenetic diversity. Here we set out to answer this question by manually annotating immune genes in 5 marsupial genomes and 1 monotreme genome to determine the impact of sequencing data type, assembly quality, and automated annotation on accurate immune annotation. Results: Genome quality is directly linked to our ability to annotate complex immune gene families, with long reads and scaffolding technologies required to reassemble immune gene clusters and elucidate evolution, organisation, and true gene content of the immune repertoire. Draft-quality genomes generated from short reads with HiC or 10× Chromium linked reads were unable to achieve this. Despite mammalian BUSCOv5 scores of up to 94.1% amongst the 6 genomes, automated annotation pipelines incorrectly annotated up to 59% of manually annotated immune genes regardless of assembly quality or method of automated annotation. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that long reads and scaffolding technologies, alongside manual annotation, are required to accurately study the immune gene repertoire of wildlife species. © 2022 The Author(s).

Grass harvesting, free grazing, farming, wetland conversion, and water extraction were the main anthropogenic factors causing the wetlands' ecological disturbance. The ecological status of Washa and Borale wetlands were thus moderately (67) and highly degraded (80), respectively. Yet, the various ESs categorized as provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services, were still delivered from both sites. Vegetables (carrots, potatoes, garlic), crops (barley, beans), grass, water, and crafting materials were the products obtained from the wetlands. Some educational, research, and recreational services were also delivered mainly from the Washa site. Still, erosion, flooding, carbon regulation, and biota (plants, birds, fish) supporting services were provided at both sites. Yet, many of the ESs provided had low and medium importance due to the wetlands' impairedness. Yet, the water and food delivered from the wetlands had high and even higher importance than the other services due to their being designed for providing water mainly for irrigation and livestock watering. Still, Washa provided higher cultural, regulating, and supporting services than the Borale's owing to its being moderately impaired and lesser buffer and catchment area disturbance. Overall, many of the ESs delivered had low and medium importance because of the wetlands' biodiversity loss, ecological degradation, and water reduction chiefly in the dry season. Yet, the people had good perceptions of the wetlands' management. Hence, for the wetlands' restoration, urgent action is required via developing a management plan. © 2022 Admasu Moges and Tesfaye Mebrate.},

abstract={Zoonotic spillover is a phenomenon characterized by the transfer of pathogens between different animal species. Most human emerging infectious diseases originate from non-human animals, and human-related environmental disturbances are the driving forces of the emergence of new human pathogens. Synthesizing the sequence of basic events involved in the emergence of new human pathogens is important for guiding the understanding, identifi cation, and description of key aspects of human activities that can be changed to prevent new outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. This review synthesizes the connections between environmental disturbances and increased risk of spillover events based on the One Health perspective. Anthropogenic disturbances in the environment (e.g., deforestation, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss, wildlife exploitation) lead to changes in ecological niches, reduction of the dilution effect, increased contact between humans and other animals, changes in the incidence and load of pathogens in animal populations, and alterations in the abiotic factors of landscapes. These phenomena can increase the risk of spillover events and, potentially, facilitate new infectious disease outbreaks. Using Brazil as a study model, this review brings a discussion concerning anthropogenic activities in the Amazon region and their potential impacts on spillover risk and spread of emerging diseases in this region. © 2022, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

abstract={Anthropogenic pressures have caused a substantial decline of global biodiversity and have been further reported to strongly affect the ecological performance of species in their habitat, especially reptiles. Understanding the ecology of species and how species respond to habitat alterations is basic knowledge needed to develop conservation programmes and address issues of biodiversity loss. All five species of tiger geckos (Goniurosaurus) in Vietnam are known to be threatened by extinction due to anthropogenic impacts such as habitat degradation and harvesting for the international pet trade. However, conservation actions have only been initiated for the better-studied species. This study provides detailed basic data on microhabitat use of two allopatric sister species, namely Goniurosaurus huuliensis and G. luii. In total, 145 geckos (including 59 records of G. huuliensis and 86 records of G. luii) were observed during field surveys. All Goniurosaurus individuals were mostly recorded in the forest on karst formations, covered with evergreen broad-leaved woody trees, intermixed with ferns, shrubs and vines. Microhabitats of the two species were relatively similar in other traits, such as high vegetation coverage, high humidity, stable ambient temperature and dry-rock substrates. A multiple factor analysis supported that the ecological niche spaces of the two species highly overlap, even though their distribution ranges are geographically separated. We further found no intraspecific niche segregation in both species. The present data provide baseline knowledge for both in situ and ex situ conservation measures to protect species in the genus Goniurosaurus. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Background and Objective: The lack of biodiversity knowledge and biodiversity loss are the two inevitable truths around us. Algae are the most crucial organism in our entire biodiversity. The seasonal variation of algal diversity can monitor the environmental changes of the freshwater ecosystem. The present study was conducted because the seasonal changes of algal diversity in Chimmony Wildlife Sanctuary were utterly unknown. Materials and Methods: The algal samples were collected and preserved from ten stations for three seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon). The physicochemical parameters of water like temperature, pH, total dissolved solids, total dissolved oxygen, total alkalinity and light intensity of the sampling stations were recorded. Results: The study revealed that the seasonal variation of physicochemical parameters provoked a change in the diversity of Algae. The Chimmony Wildlife Sanctuary has its highest algal diversity during pre-monsoon season. The Chlorophyceae Algae were dominant during the pre-monsoon season, while the Cyanophycean Algae were dominant during monsoon season. The ANOVA (two-way) analysis showed no significant difference between stations and there is a considerable difference between seasons for dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, temperature and total dissolved solids. While for pH, it showed no significant difference between seasons and stations but for light intensity, it showed a substantial difference between stations and seasons. A negative correlation was observed between algal species and seasons. The temperature and dissolved oxygen showed a negative correlation. Conclusion: The physicochemical parameters were changed according to the seasonal variation. Since Algae act as a biological pollution indicator for all the water resources, the study of algal flora according to the seasonal variation is crucial. © 2022 Joel Jose and Jobi Xavier.},

abstract={Predicted rapid increases in urbanization in the face of accelerating biodiversity loss underscores the need for urban development that promotes, rather than displaces, native plants and animals. One approach for increasing urban biodiversity is through the development of “green infrastructure”. Although research has explored urban-rural gradients and the overall value of urban green infrastructure, few studies have investigated the habitat value for wildlife of different types of urban greenspace. Here, we use a well-established metric in ecology, giving up-densities (GUDs), to compare foraging costs for a common urban wildlife species, the eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), among three green infrastructure categories: municipal parks, college campuses, and residential yards. We found that GUDs for gray squirrels did not differ significantly among location categories after controlling for proximity to roads, but proximity to roads was associated with significantly higher GUDs in all locations. In an explicit test, we also found that both proximity to roads and traffic volume were associated with higher GUDs. We also found that maximum distance from roads was significantly higher for campuses and parks than for residential yards, indicating a greater proportion of the area of campuses and parks is “away from roads” compared to residential yards. Our results indicate that vehicle traffic may contribute significantly to an “urban landscape of fear” for gray squirrels and suggest that campus and park configurations that reduce road effects could improve habitat quality for squirrels and possibly other animals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Alongside modernity, the human activity has been a key factor in global environmental risks, with worldwide anthropic modification being the cause of the emergence of diseases for wild and livestock animals, and even humans. In special, the increase in the spatial distribution and in the incidence of some emerging infectious diseases (EID) are directly associated to deforestation and global climate changes. Moreover, the arise of new EID agents, such as the SARS-COV-2 have been reported for the last 30 years. On the other hand, biodiversity has been shown to be a key indicator for ecosystem health, and to pose a role to increase the promotion of human public health. In neotropical regions, and in special, in Brazil, several infectious diseases have been demonstrated to be directly affected for the biodiversity loss, such as malaria, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, yellow fever, urban arboviruses, spotted fever, amongst other. To better understand the ecosystem capacity of regulation of infectious diseases, FAPESP BIOTA program have supported researchers and research projects to increase knowledge about Brazilian biodiversity and the ecosystems, such as diversity of bird bioagents, venomous animals biodiversity, diversity of mosquitos species in forest patches inside urban areas, propagation of the yellow fever virus over fragmented forest territories, loss of ecological corridors and occurrence of spotted fever and malaria, amongst others. It is noteworthy that FAPESP BIOTA is a successful program and must be expanded as an important tool for present and future public health promotion. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

abstract={Unprecedented bushfire activity is increasing around the world. A catastrophic bushfire event in the Australian summer of 2019–2020 burned over 18 million hectares. The Australian bushfires were just one set of events among many across the globe. Cumulatively, the losses are extraordinary: from losing over a quarter of the Pantanal wetland in South America to California’s Sierra Nevada and losses in the Amazon Forest. Bushfire destruction means a concomitant loss of biological diversity. Increased fire activity and frequency can adversely affect adaptive capacities of flora and fauna. Accordingly, across the globe, fire management practices and mitigation strategies are under increased scrutiny. In this article, we consider the extent to which one fire suppression strategy, prescribed burning, takes account of non-human considerations. Our examination of policy settings provides policymakers with a way to account for non-human interests. Our focus is Australia, specifically relating to one national park within New South Wales. Across the world, fire containment strategies must be reassessed to decipher how well non-human considerations are placed to withstand changing fire regimes. With likely increases in bush and wildfire activity across the globe, associated with Anthropocentric climate change, there is an urgent need to account for non-human interests in prescribed burning policies and regulations. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={To effectively combat the biodiversity crisis, we need ambitious targets and reliable indicators to accurately track trends and measure conservation impact. In Canada, the Living Planet Index (LPI) has been adapted to produce a national indicator by both World Wildlife Fund-Canada (Canadian Living Planet Index; C-LPI) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (Canadian Species Index) to provide insight into the status of Canadian wildlife, by evaluating temporal trends in vertebrate population abundance. The indicator includes data for just over 50% of Canadian vertebrate species. To assess whether the current dataset is representative of the distribution of life history characteristics of Canadian wildlife, we analyzed the representation of species-specific biotic variables (i.e., body size, trophic level, lifespan) for vertebrates within the C-LPI compared to native vertebrates lacking LPI data. Generally, there was considerable overlap in the distribution of biotic variables for species in the C-LPI compared to native Canadian vertebrate species lacking LPI data. Nevertheless, some differences among distributions were found, driven in large part by discrepancy in the representation of fishes—where the C-LPI included larger-bodied and longer-lived species. We provide recommendations for targeted data collection and additional analyses to further strengthen the applicability, accuracy, and representativity of biodiversity indicators. © 2022 Canadian Science Publishing.

abstract={In Aotearoa New Zealand children learn about biodiversity loss and protection through a bicultural environmental education (EE) program. Connected with Predator Free NZ, a nationwide restoration project, the program teaches children about killing possums, rats, and stoats. Children’s involvement in possum killing has a long, troubling history in Aotearoa and EE is now working to transform attitudes from ‘hating possums’ into respecting all animals. This paper analysis the recent shift in rhetoric, with a focus on the discord between animal rights scholars and EE and by addressing the histories of Aotearoa, possums, and EE. With the help of Donna Haraway, Rangimārie Rose Pere, and other indigenous scholars, the troubles obscuring the move into interspecies respect are made visible. Militarized discourse, war games, individualism, Restoration, nature-culture divide, and human exceptionalism, are all emphasized as barriers. This paper also draws attention to a major concern with possum-child worlds and EE research in that children’s voice is seriously lacking. It is then argued that children’s stories must be present in future EE research, and that the pathway toward respecting possums is one and the same, located in indigenous, interspecies, children’s, and ecofeminist stories.

abstract={Biodiversity losses can alter ecosystem functioning. In this context, sandy beach macrobenthic species are highly vulnerable due to anthropogenic impacts and global changes. Evaluating and monitoring life history-based biological traits is a key goal for ecologists to investigate biodiversity and ecosystem functioning changes. Due to environmental conditions, however, life-history traits may vary among regions, even for similar taxa. The South Atlantic Coast is highly under-sampled compared with North Atlantic regions. Here, we investigate the life cycle, population dynamics, and reproductive biology of the key species Atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis (Dana, 1853) from a Southwestern Atlantic Coast sandy beach. We followed field time-series data of multiple life-cycle-based biological traits. The body length of A. brasiliensis varied from 1.25 to 11.86 mm. Longevity was estimated at 11.9 months for both males and females. Growth parameters were estimated as L∞ = 12.9 mm, k = 2.3, t0 = −0.10 for males and L∞ = 12.3, k = 2, t0 = −0.13 for females. The population showed continuous reproduction and multiple cohorts without seasonality. The mean sex ratio was female-biased (1.71: 1). Females bear a mean of 4–6 eggs per marsupium, with egg volume between 0.0472 and 0.0501 mm3. Female maturation was estimated at age 3.53 months, with L50% = 7.0 mm. Biological trait evaluations of A. brasiliensis were similar to those found for amphipods in South America and differed from those of similar taxa found in North Atlantic. Monitoring life history based-biological traits is essential to make management decisions, especially in environmental protection areas with vulnerable species whose recovery is challenging, to maintain the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The creation and establishment of protected areas serve as tools for guaranteeing biodiversity conservation. In this study, we examined the diversity of medium- and large-sized mammals and flightless walking birds that are supported by a protected area system, the Ischigualasto–Talampaya system, and its area of influence. We set up 106 camera traps and analysed all data with rank–abundance curves and Hill numbers as a measure of diversity. Species richness was lower in protected areas, unlike in the buffer zone, due to the absence of domestic species. Native species were present all over the area, but with variations in their abundances, showing that the presence of domestic species in low densities would not negatively affect the richness of native species, but would indeed affect their abundance. © 2022 Biodiversity Conservancy International.},

abstract={Amid global biodiversity loss, it is important to find practical tools and solutions in order to protect biodiversity. Ecotourism is the fastest-growing sector of the international travel industry and can be a powerful conservation tool that encourages people to protect the natural environment. Traditionally, frogs have not generated much attention among ecotourists, partly because they are easily overshadowed by other more charismatic species or habitat attractions. With almost a third of the nearly 7000 known amphibian species listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), their protection is crucial. Frogging is a well-known term within the frog conservation society, describing the activity of searching for frogs in the wild. This can be combined with other ecotourism activities to attract tourists and create an interest in the conservation of frogs while having fun at the same time. The aim was to determine the ecotourism potential of frogs in South Africa, primarily by distributing questionnaires to tourists to retrieve information on whether they would be interested in participating in frog-related ecotourism activities within the South African National Parks. For this research, a quantitative research approach was followed, namely non-probability sampling, to which convenience sampling was applied. An online survey (questionnaire) was designed to collect the data for the research. The survey outcome was satisfactory, as potential tourists indicated that they would like to participate in frog-related activities. The project offers the opportunity to conserve frogs, educate tourists, and create job opportunities within the local communities. It will also create a new tourism product for the South African National Parks. Conservation implications: The contribution of this research to conservation lies in the opportunity to benefit frog conservation through ecotourism. © 2022. The Authors.},

abstract={Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been adopted globally as a tool to combat biodiversity loss and restore marine ecosystems. Successful application of MPAs will be predicated on the ability to monitor biodiversity in a synoptic and noninvasive manner. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods have important advantages over traditional biodiversity survey methods for monitoring conservation areas. To evaluate the efficacy of eDNA metabarcoding for fish biodiversity monitoring, we sampled 19 coastal eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds in Canada, as eelgrass beds are known for high biodiversity and significant conservation value. At each site, beach seines were used to survey fish and water samples were collected contemporaneously for eDNA metabarcoding. In total, beach seining caught 32 672 individuals across 59 fish taxa, and eDNA detected 129 fish taxa. eDNA captured site-level variation and detected higher species richness at both site and regional levels compared to seining. eDNA abundance had a positive association with capture abundance. Collectively these results highlight how eDNA metabarcoding offers an efficient approach for monitoring fish biodiversity in coastal eelgrass beds, thus providing a valuable and noninvasive tool for MPA planning and coastal monitoring. © 2022 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.},

abstract={The current biodiversity loss is dramatic. Over the past 50 years, more than 68% of the mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish on Earth have disappeared, putting the planet's survival and its inhabitants—including human beings—at risk. Financialization, or the transformation of nature into financial assets, is increasingly proposed as a solution to the biodiversity crisis. Proponents of financialization believe that assigning a monetary value to nature will incentivize human beings to protect habitats and their species. This article offers a four-mechanism model of nature's financialization, explaining why it is virtually impossible to financialize nature. We collected data through a unique two-stage data collection process, including a single case study and additional interviews with conservationists and conservation finance specialists. We analyzed the development of a calculative device, the “Index,” designed to assess the impact of conservation efforts on the survival of endangered species. Conservationists hoped to use the Index to calculate the financial return of a conservation impact bond, a financial instrument designed to finance conservation projects. However, they did not achieve their goal. We discuss the implications for the financialization and conservation literature and the role of accounting therein. We notably question previous accounts of financialization, including the need for financial numbers or financial actors. We ultimately show that a financialization project can transform practices toward financialization, even if the financialization process is not complete. © 2022 Canadian Academic Accounting Association.},

abstract={Invasive alien species (IAS) are major drivers of global biodiversity loss, and the poorly regulated international pet trade is a source of emerging and future invaders. Predictions of the likely ecological impacts and risks of such IAS have been significantly enhanced in recent years with new metrics, which require application to many more actual and potential IAS. Hence, this study assesses the potential ecological impacts and risks of two readily available pet trade species: goldfish, Carassius auratus, a species with non-native populations worldwide; and white cloud mountain minnow, Tanichthys albonubes, a species with a limited invasion history to date. First, we compared the per capita feeding rates of these non-native species with two European trophically analogous natives – the stone loach, Barbatula barbatula, and the common minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus – using the Comparative Functional Response method. Second, we used foraging experiments in conspecific pairs to determine synergistic, neutral or antagonistic intraspecific interactions. Third, we performed novel object experiments using the two pet trade species to assess boldness, a known “dispersal enhancing trait”. Goldfish had the highest maximum feeding rates of the four species, while white cloud mountain minnows had the lowest. Neutral interactions were observed for all four species in the paired foraging experiments, with goldfish having the highest consumption and white cloud mountain minnows having the lowest. Goldfish demonstrated greater boldness, being more active during the experimental trials and more likely to approach a novel object than white cloud mountain minnows. Further, combining maximum feeding rates, boldness and species availabilities from our survey of pet shops, we assessed the relative invasion risks (RIR) of the two non-natives. This highlighted goldfish as the higher risk and most worthy of management prioritisation, mirroring its more extensive invasion history. We propose that such metrics have potential to direct future IAS policy decisions and management towards the ever-increasing rates of biological invasions worldwide. © Copyright James W. E.

abstract={Global biodiversity loss is most severe in freshwaters, particularly in river ecosystems. Hydropower is one of the main culprits. While being promoted as a carbon free source of renewable energy, hydropower disrupts the flow, habitats, and biota of rivers. Environmental policies and programs seek to mitigate the damage hydropower causes. Any policy action aiming at making the utilization of our rivers more sustainable must be ecologically, economically, and legally feasible. We show that the interdisciplinary feasibility of mitigation measures divides existing facilities into three categories (i) large facilities in which biodiversity mitigation measures are needed but electricity generation and balancing the electricity grid should remain as their main focus, (ii) small facilities in which dam removal and full scale river restoration measures can be taken by assisting the facilities to seize operations, preferably just before their next big investments, and (iii) medium facilities where benefits and trade-offs associated with alternative paths should be analyzed case-by-case to determine the most feasible path forward. Policy action is feasible in all three categories but in different ways: requiring fish passes in the case of large facilities, helping remove dams and restoring the rivers in the case of small facilities, and focusing cost–benefit analysis efforts on the non-trivial group of the medium sized facilities. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={With some taxa, a reduction in the mean size of individuals may reflect over-harvesting and/or trophy hunting. However, we show that in sea turtles, a reduction in the mean size of breeding individuals may be part of the good news story of an expanding population. We describe a 70-fold increase in annual nest numbers on the island of Sal (Cape Verde, North Atlantic) between 2008 and 2020 (from 506 to 35 507 nests), making this now one of the largest loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nesting aggregations in the world. We use 20 128 measurements of the size of nesting turtles to show that their mean annual size has decreased by about 2.4 cm, from 83.2 to 80.8 cm. This decrease in the mean size of nesting turtles was not caused by the removal of larger turtles, for example by selective harvesting. Rather we develop a theoretical model to show than this decrease in mean size can be explained by an influx of first-time nesters, combined with a decrease in the size of those first-time nesters over time. A reduction in mean size of nesting turtles has been reported across the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, and may be a common feature of population recoveries in sea turtles. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

abstract={People who regard nature as important and personally meaningful are often compelled to conserve it. This compulsion is increasingly vital in a world where global climate and biodiversity crises are worsening, with younger generations set to bear most of the resulting ecological burden. By understanding why children and adolescents value nature, we can gain insights into how they might act for its benefit. In this study, we asked over 1000 Australian students (aged 8–14) to explain why ‘nature’ was—or was not—important to them. Qualitative responses were gathered via a survey methodology using an online questionnaire, with thematic analysis used to identify key findings. Results show that respondents valued nature for its ability to keep humans alive and resourced, also appreciating nature as beautiful and relaxing. Respondents frequently commented on how nature made them feel: happiness, love, freedom, and calm featured prominently. A small number of students reported ambivalence about nature, or even feelings of fear. These results demonstrate substantial depth to students’ understandings of nature and the ways they choose to engage with their surroundings. Encompassing a diversity of perspectives on nature allows us to better engage with youth on environmental matters. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Global changes in response to human encroachment into natural habitats and carbon emissions are driving the biodiversity extinction crisis and increasing disease emergence risk. Host distributions are one critical component to identify areas at risk of viral spillover, and bats act as reservoirs of diverse viruses. We developed a reproducible ecological niche modelling pipeline for bat hosts of SARS-like viruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus), given that several closely related viruses have been discovered and sarbecovirus-host interactions have gained attention since SARS-CoV-2 emergence. We assessed sampling biases and modelled current distributions of bats based on climate and landscape relationships and project future scenarios for host hotspots. The most important predictors of species distributions were temperature seasonality and cave availability. We identified concentrated host hotspots in Myanmar and projected range contractions for most species by 2100. Our projections indicate hotspots will shift east in Southeast Asia in locations greater than 2°C hotter in a fossil-fuelled development future. Hotspot shifts have implications for conservation and public health, as loss of population connectivity can lead to local extinctions, and remaining hotspots may concentrate near human populations. ©},

abstract={The introduction of exotic species is the second leading cause of biodiversity loss worldwide. The neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis) is considered one of the top predators of aquatic environments, so its presence exerts a natural control over other animal populations. The objective of this work was to describe the feeding habits of the otter and document the consumption of exotic fish species. Four transects of 10 km were established in the Ayuquila-Armería and Marabasco rivers, near the Sierra de Manantlán Biosphere Reserve, for stool collection, in the dry and rainy seasons of 2018. In the laboratory, feces were washed, seined and dried in an oven at 70°C for 24 h; later, the consumed components were separated and identified. A total of 101 feces were collected in the Ayuquila-Armería river, and 93 in the Marabasco river. An 80% of the food is made up of fish and crustaceans, while the remaining 20% includes insects, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, mollusks and plant matter. Sixteen species of fish consumed were identified, of which five are exotic. The neotropical otter presents an opportunistic and generalist diet, based mainly on the consumption of fish and crustaceans. © 2022 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Projects that pay communities or individuals to conserve natural areas rarely continue indefinitely. When payments cease, the behaviors they motivate can change. Previous research on conservation-based payments recognizes the impermanence of conservation success, but it does not consider the legacy of payments that failed to effect change. This research assesses impermanence and failure by investigating the legacy of village-level conservation payments made through one of the largest Integrated Conservation and Development Projects in Indonesia. The Kerinci-Seblat Integrated Conservation and Development Project aimed to conserve forest area and promote local development through voluntary conservation agreements (VCAs) that provided payments for pro-conservation pledges and activities from 2000 through 2003. Project documentation and previous research find that payments failed to incentivize additional forest conservation, producing nonsignificant differences in forest-cover change during the project period. To examine the legacy of these payments in the post-project period, this research uses matched difference-in-differences and triple differences models to analyze forest cover change in villages (n = 263) from 2000 through 2016 as well as matched binary logistic regression models to assess enduring differences in household (n = 1303) livelihood strategies within VCA villages in 2016. The analysis finds that VCA villages contained significantly more forest loss than the most similar non-VCA villages outside the national park, and greater payments predict increased forest loss in the post-project period. In addition, farming high-value tree crops and cultivating private land were the most important attributes for modeling VCA affiliation among randomly selected households. These results demonstrate that, after payments ceased, project failures increased in severity over time.Those who design and implement conservation-based payments bear great responsibility to ensure their projects are informed by local voice, align with community preferences, and provide sufficient benefits, lest they result in a conservation legacy of increased failure. © 2022 The Author(s).

abstract={To address the global biodiversity crisis, standardized data that are rapidly obtainable through minimally invasive means are needed for documenting change and informing conservation within threatened and diverse systems, such as coral reefs. In this data paper, we describe 18S rRNA gene amplicon data (V1-V3 region) generated from samples collected to begin characterizing coral reef eukaryotic community composition at the Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the Central Pacific Ocean. Sixteen samples were obtained across four sample types: sediments from two sieved fractions (100-500 μm, n = 3; 500 μm-2 mm, n = 3) and sessile material scrapings (n = 3) from Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) sampled in 2015, as well as seawater from 2012 (n = 7). After filtering and contaminant removal, 3,861 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were produced from 1,062,238 reads. The rarefaction curves demonstrated adequate sampling depth, and communities grouped by sample type. The dominant orders across samples were polychaete worms (Eunicida), demosponges (Poecilosclerida), and bryozoans (Cheilostomatida). The ten most common orders in terms of relative abundance comprised ∼60% of all sequences and 23% of ASVs, and included reefbuilding crustose coralline algae (CCA; Corallinophycidae) and stony corals (Scleractinia), two taxa associated with healthy reefs. Highlighting the need for further study, ∼21% of the ASVs were identified as uncultured, incertae sedis, or not assigned to phylum or order. This data paper presents the first 18S rDNA survey at Palmyra Atoll and serves as a baseline for biodiversity assessment, monitoring, and conservation of this remote and pristine ecosystem. © 2022 The authors.},

abstract={The link between current dietary patterns and their adverse impact on the environment is well established. Thus, previous studies have raised concerns that environmental social movement organizations, as social change entrepreneurs, often fail to adequately make food an issue, especially animal-based foods, nor strongly advocate needed solutions, including shifting to plant-based diets. Building upon this, but specifically addressing the biodiversity crisis through a critical animal studies lens, we examine how seven international conservation organizations connect wildlife issues to human food production and consumption. Through a collective action framing analysis of social movement websites, we ascertain in what ways and to what extent these conservation organizations (1) recognize dietary choices, farming, and fishing as drivers of species loss and harm to animals, (2) suggest individual consumer solutions and systemic government and industry solutions (both voluntary and legally-mandated), and (3) appeal to motivational values that are not just anthropocentric, but also ecocentric and biocentric (showing concern for the welfare and rights of individual animals, human and nonhuman). We make strategic recommendations for including biocentric and interspecies justice perspectives in food advocacy messaging of conservation organizations to help stem the tide of mass extinction while cultivating greater respect for all types of animals. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Habitat transformation is identified as major threat to biodiversity loss globally, affecting threatened raptors. Changes in land use can alter the abundance and distribution of birds of prey by affecting habitat availability and quality. In this study, we used multivariate analyses to investigate the effect of habitat alteration on the demography of a declining Eastern Imperial Eagle (Aquila heliaca), making assumptions for future population trajectories. We used the Generalized Linear Mixed Models with Poisson distribution and Log link function, searching a relationship between the demographic parameters and the landscape structure and possible effects of fragmentation. In our study area, habitat change affected dramatically permanent grasslands, shrinking their availability. As we expected, the share of grasslands in eagles’ territories significantly affected occupancy rate, but not productivity and breeding frequency. We found that occupancy rate decreased significantly, while productivity and breeding frequency showed no trend. Modeling the effect of habitat alteration on Eastern Imperial Eagle demography, we found out that territory quality was a more powerful factor driving the response of a top predator to the alteration of favorite foraging habitats. Only the habitat quality in source territories had a significant positive effect on eagle productivity. We found that simple rules to predict adverse agricultural impact on territory abandonment or breeding productivity of a top predator were not reliable. Our results could be used for planning conservation of other large territorial raptors, facing the same type of threat. © 2022 The Authors},

funding_text 2={We found that land-use patterns of our study area changed significantly after the country's accession to the EU. Spectacular loss of different types of grasslands, especially permanent pastures, was recorded in the first programming period for Bulgaria (2007?2013), following the implementation of CAP. This occurred throughout most of the country (Dobrev et al., 2014), particularly affecting the Sakar Mnt., the adjacent Dervent Heights, and the western foothills of the Strandzha Mnt., where most of the EIE population in Bulgaria is concentrated and where most of the areas are source territories (Demerdzhiev et al., 2014b). This resulted in a change in the land-use pattern expressed as widespread conversion of grasslands into cropland and establishment of large arable monoculture fields mainly sown with cereals, sunflower, and oil rape. Hence, in the 1990s, a significant part of the arable land in the country was abandoned. Therefore, by 2007 (the year of Bulgaria's accession to the EU), only 58.4% of the arable land in Bulgaria was cultivated (Agrostatistics, 2011). After Bulgaria's accession to the EU and the related pre-accession funding, a gradual process of partial restoration of livestock breeding began in the semi-mountainous regions. Thus, formerly arable lands that were subsequently abandoned were converted into semi-natural permanent grasslands. However, the accession to the EU and the implementation of the CAP and the Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS) in particular, led to widespread plowing of these semi-natural permanent grasslands and their conversion back to arable areas (Dobrev et al., 2014).Many volunteers assisted with the monitoring and conservation efforts, and we are grateful for the assistance of Vera Dyulgerska, Svetoslav Spasov, Edita Difova, Ivaylo Angelov, Nikolai Terziev, Tzeno Petrov, Petar Iankov, Vladimir Trifonov, Nedko Nedyalkov, Atanas Demerdzhiev, Krasimira Demerdzhieva, Georgi Georgiev, Dimitar Plachiysky, Georgi Gerdzhikov, Vladimir Dobrev, Vanyo Angelov, Alexander Georgiev, Vasilena Georgieva.

abstract={Supporting the recovery of large carnivores is a popular yet challenging endeavour. Estuarine crocodiles in Australia are a large carnivore conservation success story, with the population having extensively recovered from past heavy exploitation. Here, we explored if dietary changes had accompanied this large population recovery by comparing the isotopes δ13C and δ15N in bones of crocodiles sampled 40 to 55 years ago (small population) with bones from contemporary individuals (large population). We found that δ13C and δ15N values were significantly lower in contemporary crocodiles than in the historical cohort, inferring a shift in prey preference away from marine and into terrestrial food webs. We propose that an increase in intraspecific competition within the recovering crocodile population, alongside an increased abundance of feral ungulates occupying the floodplains, may have resulted in the crocodile population shifting to feed predominantly upon terrestrial food sources. The number of feral pigs consumed to sustain and grow crocodile biomass may help suppress pig population growth and increase the flow of terrestrially derived nutrients into aquatic ecosystems. The study highlights the significance of prey availability in contributing to large carnivore population recovery. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={(Semi-)natural ecosystems provide many important benefits to nature and people, but are often located near populated and urbanized areas across the globe. During recreational activities, many people bring dogs into peri-urban forests and nature, but their nutrient inputs per unit space and time via dog faeces and urine into ecosystems remain scarcely quantified. Here, we estimate net fertilization rates of dogs in peri-urban ecosystems, with a focus on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) because of their evident effects on plant biodiversity. We used 487 direct-count censuses over 1.5 years to collect accurate dog abundance data per hectare per year in four sites in peri-urban forests and nature reserves in Belgium. Based on estimated dog densities and a systematic literature search of nutrient concentrations in urine and faeces, we calculate N and P fertilization rates from urine and faeces deposits, also propagating uncertainty and variability in these estimates. We find that canine N and P fertilization rates on average amount to 11 kg N (more or less equally from urine and faeces) and 5 kg P (predominantly from faeces) per hectare per year, respectively. These estimated amounts are substantial when compared to atmospheric inputs of N and extractable amounts via traditional nature management (e.g. mowing and hay removal). Our estimated dog N and P fertilization rates in peri-urban forests and nature are substantial. Such levels of nutrient inputs may considerably influence biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and co-determine restoration outcomes. Our results underpin the need for managers and policy makers to more often (i) consider currently neglected nutrient inputs by dogs in management plans and restoration goals, (ii) communicate to dog walkers the role of their dog as ‘fertilizer’ and highlight the necessity to remove at least canine solid faecal waste, (iii) in sensitive oligotrophic ecosystems with species adapted to nutrient-poor soils, establish nearby off-leash dog parks, enforce the use of short leashes and/or apply dog bans such that high dog abundances can be avoided. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Planning and policy are best done through integrated approaches that holistically address multiple sustainability issues. Climate change and biodiversity loss are two of the most significant issues facing our planet. Accordingly, advancements in integrated sustainability planning and policy require a means for examining how certain strategies and actions may align or conflict with these sustainability imperatives. Here, we enhance the knowledge of integrated approaches for addressing sustainability challenges by developing and applying a framework for examining different planning and policy areas in the context of climate action and biodiversity conservation. As a case study, we used wildlife crossing planning and landscape connectivity policy in Canada, which is currently piecemeal, fragmented, and could benefit from an integrated approach. The study was conducted in two stages. First, we developed an analytical framework for examining issues in the context of climate action and biodiversity conservation co-benefits and trade-offs. Then, we applied the framework to wildlife crossing and landscape connectivity issues to elucidate opportunities and challenges for integrated planning and policy. We used a literature review to develop an integrated climate-biodiversity framework (ICBF). ICBF was subsequently applied to wildlife crossing and landscape connectivity planning and policies in Canada. ICBF maps relationships between climate action and biodiversity conservation co-benefits and trade-offs and is organized into six themes: green space, transportation, green infrastructure, food and agriculture, energy, and land management. Applying ICBF to participant interview data produced insights into opportunities and challenges for integrated approaches to wildlife crossing and landscape connectivity by elucidating potential co-benefits and trade-offs such as alignments between stormwater management and aquatic crossings (i.e., co-benefits) and potential issues related to energy development and habitat fragmentation (i.e., trade-offs). ICBF has application beyond wildlife crossings, and its continual use and refinement will result in a better understanding of how to effectively implement integrated approaches and transition toward sustainable development paths. © 2022 by the author(s).

abstract={Smartphone apps have enhanced the potential for monitoring of invasive alien species (IAS) through citizen science. They now have the capacity to massively increase the volume and spatiotemporal coverage of IAS occurrence data accrued in centralised databases. While more reporting apps are developed each year, innovation across diverse functionalities and data management in this field are occurring separately and simultaneously amongst numerous research groups with little attention to trends, priorities and opportunities for improvement. This creates the risk of duplication of effort and missed opportunities for implementing new and existing functionalities that would directly benefit IAS research and management. Using a literature search of Early Detection and Rapid Response implementation, smartphone app development and invasive species reporting apps, we developed a rubric for quantitatively assessing the functionality of IAS reporting apps and applied this rubric to 41 free, English-language IAS reporting apps, available via major mobile app stores in North America. The five highest performing apps achieved scores of 61.90% to 66.35% relative to a hypothetical maximum score, indicating that many app features and functionalities, acknowledged to be useful for IAS reporting in literature, are not present in sampled apps. This suggests that current IAS reporting apps do not make use of all available and known functionalities that could maximise their efficacy. Major implementation gaps, highlighted by this rubric analysis, included limited implementation in user engagement (particularly gamification elements and social media compatibility), ancillary information on search effort, detection method, the ability to report absences and local habitat characteristics. The greatest advancement in IAS early detection would likely result from app gamification. This would make IAS reporting more engaging for a growing community of non-professional contributors and encourage frequent and prolonged participation. We discuss these implementation gaps in relation to the increasingly urgent need for Early Detection and Rapid Response frameworks. We also recommend future innovations in IAS reporting app development to help slow the spread of IAS and curb the global economic and biodiversity extinction crises. We also suggest that further funding and investment in this and other implementation gaps could greatly increase the efficacy of current IAS reporting apps and increase their contributions to addressing the contemporary biological invasion threat © Copyright Leif Howard et al.

abstract={Tortoises and freshwater turtles are among the most threatened taxa of vertebrates in the world due to consumption, urban development, agriculture, and land and water pollution. About 50% of the currently recognised chelonian species are considered threatened with extinction according to the IUCN Red List. Asia is an epicentre for the turtle and tortoise extinction crisis, containing the highest diversity of threatened species. In this study, we used species distribution models (SDMs) to assess the effectiveness of existing protected areas across Southeast and South Asia for the conservation of three large critically endangered freshwater turtles (Batagur borneoensis, B. affinis, and Pelochelys cantorii). We derived the models based on selected bioclimatic variables at the sites of known species records. Our SDMs showed that Indonesia is of particular importance in prioritising conservation for these three species, containing the largest areas of suitable habitat within protected areas. However, when considering water surface coverage, Thailand has the highest proportion of suitable areas under protection. Our results suggest that the present cover of protected network reserves seems inadequate in terms of size and should be expanded to sustain populations of the three target species. Therefore, we identified priority areas and reserves critical for further field surveys to guide the potential discovery of novel populations. To investigate the effect of climate change, we also projected potential distributions onto ensembles of four IPCC story lines. As a result, we found larger extralimital areas of suitable environment for all three species, particularly northwards and inland. However, high degrees of uncertainty in climate conditions indicate few reserves may provide long term protection. Lastly, we review the threats and propose recommendations for conservation of these poorly known freshwater turtles. © 2022. the authors, CC-BY 4.0 license. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The replacement of natural landscapes by anthropic environments has led to habitat loss and consequently, to the decline and extinction of many species populations. Several strategies, such as the creation of protected areas (PAs) and payment for ecosystem services have been adopted to mitigate the consequences of this biodiversity crisis. In Rio Verde, Goiás, Brazil, a Water Producer Program (WPP) was established, which provides payment for ecosystem services for the maintenance of riparian vegetation in the region of the Ribeirão Abóbora, a river which supplies the city and metropolitan area. In the absence of environmental diagnostic studies in the region, this present study contributes to reducing some knowledge gaps, through the: (i) characterization of the landscape in the WPP area, (ii) characterization of species of fauna (amphibians, birds, fish, and medium and large terrestrial mammals) and woody flora that occur in this area, and (iii) comparison of species diversity (fauna and flora) found in our study area with the diversity observed in the Cerrado protected area network. Our results reveal a low native vegetation cover (~21% of total area), but we recorded 300 total species: 20 species of anuran amphibians, 100 birds, 10 fish, 16 terrestrial mammals (medium and large), and 154 woody plants. Our sample comprises species considered endemic to the Cerrado (e.g., Anuran-Barycholos terntezi and Mammal-Callithrix penicillata), threatened species (e.g., Mammals-Herpailurus yagouaroundi, Myrmecophaga tridactyla and Tapirus terrestris), and exotic invasive species (Mammal-Sus scrofa). The results presented in this study are relevant and may help in the proposal of management actions within the scope of this important program of payment for environmental services. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

abstract={Biodiversity loss is a pressing challenge. This is particularly so in regions where the pressure on ecosystems is high such as in the Sahel region. This pressure is due, inter alia, to different land uses such as pastoralism. In this context, the present systematic review analyses the state of research on the nexus between pastoralism and biodiversity in West Africa. In particular, it explores the relationships between pastoralism (cf. agro-pastoralism, sylvo-pastoralism, agro-sylvo-pastoralism), on the one hand, and plant diversity, animal diversity, and ecosystem diversity, on the other hand. The paper also analyses the bibliometrics of the research field. A search performed in March 2021 on the Web of Science yielded 205 documents and 73 of them were included in the systematic review. The bibliometric analysis suggests an increasing interest in the research field, especially in Burkina Faso and Benin, but also the weakness of the domestic research system as a large share of the selected documents is authored by researchers based outside West Africa. In general, the scholarly literature shows a negative impact of pastoralism on plant diversity (cf. richness, abundance, composition) and animal diversity (cf. wild herbivorous mammals, predators, birds, insects) in West Africa. However, the literature analysis suggests that the effects of pastoralism are rather mixed. They are context-specific and depend on many factors such as grazing intensity and livestock species. The effects on plant diversity differ between woody (trees and shrubs) and herbaceous species. There is a general trend towards the erosion of indigenous livestock genetic diversity due to uncontrolled mating and cross-breeding. The impacts of pastoralism on ecosystem diversity are mainly due to changes in land use and habitat fragmentation. Further multi-country, comparative studies are needed to better qualify the interactions, complementarities and possible conflicts between the different pastoralism-related land uses and biodiversity conservation in West Africa. © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

abstract={In times of massive biodiversity loss and ongoing environmental crises, it is extremely important to ensure long-term conservation efforts of threatened species like Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra). To gain insights into the status of Northern Germany’s otter population, 92 otters found dead in Schleswig-Holstein between 2015−2020 were collected and underwent detailed dissection with the aim to establish a monitoring program for this population. Examinations followed a protocol especially designed for otters, including various biological data assessments and extended sampling. The finding sites showed a clear concentration in the Continental region. Seasonal concentration differed among the years, yet peaks were seen from fall to winter. Overall, more males than females were found, although this differed among the years. The majority of otters that could be aged were between 1–3 years. Placental scars and pregnancy were recorded in only few females. Nutritional status was good in most cases. Infectious diseases found included Vagococcus lutrae, Toxoplasma gondii, and Emmonsia spp. A major cause of death was roadkill. Known sample bias in studies focusing on roadkill was considered in the finding interpretation. Continuation of the population health investigations is mandatory to analyze potential trends and to establish an actual monitoring program for Eurasian otters in Schleswig-Holstein. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Sub-Saharan social-ecological systems are undergoing changes in environmental conditions, including modifications in rainfall pattern and biodiversity loss. Consequences of such changes depend on complex causal chains which call for integrated management strategies whose efficiency could benefit from ecosystem dynamic modeling. However, ecosystem models often require lots of quantitative information for estimating parameters, which is often unavailable. Alternatively, qualitative modeling frameworks have proved useful for explaining ecosystem responses to per-turbations, while only requiring qualitative information about social-ecological interactions and events and providing more general predictions due to their validity for wide ranges of parameter values. In this paper, we propose the Ecological Discrete-Event Network (EDEN), an innovative qualitative dynamic modeling framework based on “if-then” rules generating non-deterministic dynamics. Based on expert knowledge, observations, and literature, we use EDEN to assess the effect of permanent changes in surface water and herbivores diversity on vegetation and socio-economic transitions in an East African savanna. Results show that water availability drives changes in vegetation and socio-economic transitions, while herbivore functional groups have highly contrasted effects depending on the group. This first use of EDEN in a savanna context is promising for bridging expert knowledge and ecosystem modeling. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Complex socio-ecological problems typically involve a variety of stakeholders, with viewpoints that may range between consensus and deep disagreement over values and judgments. Understanding this distribution of opinion is key to finding conservation solutions. We examine how stakeholders with widely different backgrounds vary in their judgments of rangeland degradation in Mongolia's Gobi Desert, where grazing intensity is a contested issue. We gathered the judgments of 92 stakeholders from a highly diverse group including: (i) nomadic pastoralists (herders), (ii) experts in botany, (iii) experts in wildlife ecology, and (iv) conservation policy practitioners. These stakeholders considered degradation in five ecosystems including Desert shrublands, Steppe, and Siberian Elm riparian woodlands, using written site descriptions in a workshop context. Each stakeholder considered degradation using two conceptual frameworks: the notion of “ecosystem collapse” described by the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems and the concept of ecological condition. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to examine the relationship between vegetation attributes and stakeholder judgments of condition. Although individual stakeholder varied in their judgments, we found only relatively small systematic variations between different types of stakeholders. Similarly, we found the degree of specialization of experts had little effect on the condition score. We also used GAMs to examine the relationship between vegetation attributes and stakeholder judgments of collapse, finding little variation between groups. We also explored the threshold of overall vegetation cover where stakeholders are likely to shift their judgment from collapsed to not collapsed, and while differences between ecosystems were observed, we found consensus between the different stakeholder groups within each ecosystem. Our results suggest that, at least in the context of the Southern Mongolia, diverse stakeholder groups have convergent views in respect to ecological degradation. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Climate and land-use change are two primary drivers of global biodiversity loss, which increase the risks of extinction for giant panda, an umbrella and one of the most heavily invested species in conservation. Understanding how giant panda responds to these environmental changes thus is critical for developing long-term effective conservation strategies. However, until now most studies focused on only the effects of either climate change or land-use change on giant panda. So, if the potential combined effects of these processes are greater than either of them, the current conservation recommendations would be inappropriate or misleading. Here, based on two national survey data on giant panda occurrences across nearly thirty years, we quantified the variation of giant panda's population persistence as a function of land-use (measured as forest-cover) change, climate (measured as annual mean temperature (MAT), annual mean summer temperature (MAST) and annual mean precipitation (MAP)) change, and the synergistic effect of land-use and climate change. We found forest-cover change explained 38.1% of giant panda's persistence variation, while climate change explained 20.1% of the variation, and the synergistic effect of land-use and climate change explained only 1.5% of the variation. We confirmed that forest-cover change surpassed climate change or the synergistic effect between them as the greatest force driving giant panda's population persistence. Our findings highlighted the urgent need for a more comprehensive understanding of the relative effects of climate change by integrating climate change and land-use change rather than just focusing on climate change in tackling global biodiversity loss. © 2021},

abstract={The degradation of ecosystems in the Andes, one of the most biodiverse regions in the world, is caused by de-forestation and forest fragmentation.The implementation of protected areas (PA) is an effective conservation strategy to mitigate the effects of landscape transformation on biodiversity.In the western mountain range of Colombia, in Antioquia, the Spectacled Bear Corridor (COA, ~ 4169 km2) was recently established.We describe the state of forest conservation in the COA and analyze whether areas of high biodiversity are being protected or not, using information obtained from remote sensors and large databases.The results indicate that defores-tation (162.37 km2) and fragmentation (> 90%) in the COA during the last 19 years are concentrated in the areas of greatest biodiversity, and occur both inside and outsidePA.Although protected areas reach 30% of the total area of the COA, the areas with the greatest biodiversity represent less than 17%.These results indicate the risk of biodiversity loss and the growing need to strengthen PA and to delimit new biodiverse areas. © 2022 Instituto de investigaciÃ³n de recursos biolÃ³gicos Alexander von humboldt.

abstract={Species distribution models (SDMs) provide robust inferences about species-specific site suitability and are increasingly used in systematic conservation planning (SCP). SDMs are subjected to intrinsic uncertainties, and conservation studies have generally overlooked these. The integration of SDM uncertainties in conservation solutions requires the development of a suitable optimization algorithm. Exact optimization algorithms grant efficiency to conservation solutions, but most of their implementations generate a single binary and indivisible solution. Therefore, without variation in their parameterization, they provide low flexibility in the implementation of conservation solutions by stakeholders. Contrarily, heuristic algorithms provide such flexibility, by generating large amounts of sub-optimal solutions. As a consequence, efficiency and flexibility are implicitly linked in conservation applications: mathematically efficient solutions provide less flexibility, and the flexible solutions provided by heuristics are sub-optimal. To avoid this trade-off between flexibility and efficiency in SCP, we propose a reserve-selection framework, based on exact optimization combined with a post-selection of SDM outputs. This reserve-selection framework provides flexibility and addresses the efficiency and representativeness of conservation solutions. To exemplify the approach, we analyzed an experimental design, crossing pre-and post-selection of SDM outputs versus heuristics and exact mathematical optimizations. We used the Mediterranean Sea as a biogeographical template for our analyses, integrating the outputs of eight SDM techniques for 438 fish species. © 2021 by the authors.},

abstract={Periodic drought is a major challenge in drought-prone areas of South Asia. A sample survey of farmers (n = 400) from South Asia was conducted to study the farmers’ perception about drought impacts on their socio-economic status, agro-biodiversity, and adaptation besides public institutions’ drought mitigation measures. The results revealed reduced surface and groundwater availability, soil degradation, partial or complete crop failure, increased agricultural fallows and wastelands, biodiversity loss, decrease in agricultural yields, pasture lands, and livestock in drought-impacted South Asia. About 16–26% of the farmers perceived a reduction in the agricultural area and production of commercial crops and millets in drought-prone areas, while changes in the cropping of pulses, oilseeds, horticultural, and fodder crops were minimal. About 57–92% of respondents showed a reduction in the consumption of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and fish. Unemployment, migration, reduced farm income, and malnutrition were major socio-economic impacts among respondents (38–46%). Despite sufficient public support as a mitigation strategy, the farmers had poor participation (8–65%) for agri-information and adaptation (7–36%) against drought impacts. Hence, researchers, extension agents, and policymakers must develop efficient ‘participatory-mode’ drought adaptation and mitigation policies in watershed-based semi-arid pastoral and agricultural regions of South Asia and similar agro-ecologies across the globe. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Emergent infectious disease caused by the fungal pathogens Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) represents one of the major causes of biodiversity loss in amphibians. While Bd has affected amphibians worldwide, Bsal remains restricted to Asia and Europe, but also could be a major threat for salamanders in the Western hemisphere, including the 320 bolitoglossine species described. Here, we predict the suitable areas for Bsal in the Neotropics and assess its potential impact on bolitoglossine diversity. For this, we determined the geographic patterns of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity for bolitoglossines and modeled the potential distribution of Bsal in the Neotropics. We identified which species and regions could be at risk from an eventual introduction of Bsal in the region, quantified the degree of overlap between regions of high diversity and the suitable conditions for the pathogen, and considered species IUCN Red List status, and geographic range size. We found that regions of high taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity are concentrated in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, Sierra Madre Oriental, the southern portion of Sierra Madre del Sur and the mountains of Oaxaca in México, as well as the Chiapan-Guatemalan highlands, and the Cordilleras of Costa Rica and Panama. Alarmingly, the regions of high diversity for bolitoglossines and over 75% of the ranges of the more threatened species could be affected by Bsal. Given the unknown vulnerability of these species, we strongly recommend measures to avoid the introduction of Bsal in the continent.

abstract={Drainage canals are widespread components of agricultural landscapes. Although canals have greatly contributed to biodiversity loss by desiccating wetlands, they have recently attracted conservation attention due to their potential to function as refugia for native species in intensively managed landscapes. However, their conservation role in complex landscapes composed of agricultural fields and desiccated but otherwise untransformed, semi-natural habitats, on which canals still pose a heavy burden, is unknown. Improved understanding of drainage canals and related biodiversity in these landscapes could help unlock their potential and support synergistic land management for nature conservation and water resource management. We applied a multi-taxon approach, including plants, butterflies, true bugs, spiders and birds, to (a) assess the conservation value of drainage canals with temporary water cover in a heavily drained European lowland region, (b) to test landscape-level and local canal parameters for aiding prioritization among canals and (c) to propose a reconciliation-based management framework that suits the interest of all stakeholders. We found that drainage canals and their banks concentrate more species across most taxa than semi-natural, mostly grassland habitats, possibly due to micro-environmental heterogeneity and the absence of low-intensity annual management compared to grasslands. Canals traversing semi-natural grasslands concentrate particularly high numbers of native species, but agricultural canals also support remarkable species richness. However, agricultural canals are important dispersal corridors for non-native invasive plants, which may negatively affect native biodiversity. Canal size has little effect on biodiversity, but habitat stress is an important determinant. The higher the stress (due to sandiness and salinity), the higher the added value of canals to landscape-wide biodiversity. Synthesis and applications. We show that drainage canals can harbour high biodiversity and should therefore be recognized as important novel ecosystems with high conservation value, even when cutting through semi-natural grassland habitats. Canals have previously been considered detrimental to nature conservation due to their association with loss of wetlands. However, by reducing water loss with reversible obstructions, controlling invasive species and applying specific conservation measures, they may be turned into conservation allies without compromising long-term interests of water management and agricultural land use. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={With the rapid global increase in the number and extent of marine protected areas (MPAs), there is a need for methods that enable an assessment of their actual contribution to biodiversity conservation. In Brazil, where MPAs have been designated to replenish biodiversity, there is a lack of regional-scale analysis of MPA impacts and the factors related to positive ecological change. This study aims to quantify the magnitude of the ecological effects of Brazilian MPAs and test whether some study and MPA characteristics (e.g., taxonomic group studied, exploitation level of species, MPA area, protection time, management effectiveness, level of connectedness, etc.) were underlying factors associated with their performance. We conducted a structured search in a database of scientific articles, selecting comparative studies of direct biodiversity metrics inside and outside MPAs offering different protection levels (i.e., fully- or partially-protected MPAs) or within MPAs with distinct zones. We then carried out a meta-analysis based on 424 observations found in 18 articles. Averaged across all studies, we found that MPAs had a 17% increase in the abundance of species, length of individuals, and community diversity. When compared to open-access areas, fully-protected MPAs increased biodiversity by 45%. However, MPAs offering partial protection had variable effects, ranging from significant positive to significant negative effects. MPA effects depended on the taxonomic group and exploitation level of species, with the strongest positive effects seen on exploited fish species and benthic invertebrates. Partially-protected MPAs that reported strong positive effects required long time of protection (>15years) and high level of connectivity. Conversely, fully-protected MPAs (i.e., no-take ones) could be effective even when small, under intense fishing pressure in their surroundings, and regardless of their level of connectivity. We used the Brazilian MPAs as a case study, but these results can contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of the association between ecological impacts of MPAs and drivers of conservation success, and offer key information to consolidate MPA networks that sustain biodiversity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Belowground biodiversity loss from anthropogenic causes is far less addressed and quantified than aboveground biodiversity loss. Soil fauna supports soil productivity and biogeochemical cycles, and their decline needs further research. We tested the effects of a woodland harvest gradient (0, 30, 50, and 70% biomass removal) on litterfall, mesofauna density, and Oribatida diversity in three sites of northwestern Patagonia (Argentina). Sites contrasted in plant community structure and productivity. Acari from litter and soil were compared. Annual litter production showed a 58% decline at the highest harvest intensity level, which was constant across sites. Litter structural α- diversity decreased with the highest intensity harvest only at the high productivity site. The density of soil-inhabiting Acari did not change with increasing harvest intensity, while the density of Acari inhabiting the litter decreased by 65% at the highest harvest intensity. Within Acari, Oribatida inhabiting the litter had the most significant density decline with increasing harvest intensity. Oribatida richness and α- diversity only differed among sites, suggesting resistance to increasing biomass removal despite shifts in litter production and litter structural diversity. Prostigmata did not respond to increasing biomass removal either in soil or litter. Our study is the first to assess Acari response to an aboveground biomass removal gradient in southern woodlands. Applying high biomass removal to low productivity sites can compromise micro detritivore density and thus, impair its functional role. Site productivity should be considered in management plans entailing conservation of soil fauna in southern woodlands. © 2021},

abstract={Foundation species strongly influence other organisms and declines in foundation species due to disturbance can have impacts that extend throughout communities. Spinifex grasses (Triodia spp.) are foundation species of arid Australia that provide resources to many birds, mammals, reptiles and invertebrates. We tested drivers of Triodia scariosa presence and abundance at local and landscape scales using a Bayesian structural equation model and species distribution modelling, based on the mapped distribution of 11,887 spinifex plants in remnant vegetation across a ~12,000 km2 agricultural region. At the local scale (&lt;1 km), there was a negative effect of soil phosphorus on spinifex abundance, particularly when the prevalence of other grasses was high. These results suggest that the combination of other grasses and nutrient enrichment promote hostile conditions for spinifex in small agricultural remnants, possibly through altered competitive interactions. However, at the landscape scale (100 + km), there was a positive effect of phosphorus on spinifex abundance, reinforcing the importance of multi-scale studies. Spinifex presence at the landscape scale was best determined by proximity to nature reserves. Sites closest to reserves were cleared later than more distant sites, which suggests a trajectory of decline consistent with an extinction debt. Our results correspond with a global phenomenon of delayed biodiversity loss and identify key threats to foundation species in human-dominated landscapes. Given that our proposed mechanisms of loss, nutrient enrichment and possible competition are widespread in agricultural regions throughout the world, understanding how to mitigate threats to foundation species should be a priority. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Context: Forest loss and fragmentation are rapidly expanding across the tropics. Although forest loss is a major driver of the current biodiversity crisis, the effect of fragmentation remains debated, particularly for forest-specialist species. Objectives: We evaluated the univariate and combined effect of forest loss (percent of forest cover) and fragmentation (forest patch density) on populations of a forest-specialist primate, the black-fronted titi monkey (Callicebus nigrifrons), in the landscapes from a transitional zone between Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes. Methods: We surveyed titi monkey density in 14 landscapes. Using a multiscale and multimodel inference approach, we tested the relative effect of each landscape variable assessed at their respective scales of effect on titi monkey density. Results: Titi monkey density ranged from 0 to 12 groups/km2 and was best predicted by the combined effect of forest cover and patch density. Density increased in forest patches embedded in more deforested and fragmented landscapes. Interestingly, the effect of forest patch density was consistently positive along the entire evaluated forest cover gradient (9–42%). Conclusions: Our findings support that fragmentation per se can have positive effects on biodiversity, in this case, by increasing the likelihood that more individuals can be ‘rescued’ from deforestation and crowded in the remaining forest patches. Although the long-term consequences of living crowded in forest patches are unknown, a conservative approach for preserving this (and potentially other) forest-specialist species could be to promote forest restoration projects focused on increasing the number and/or size of forest patches in the landscape (i.e., reverse fragmentation). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Crop production has negative effect on the biodiversity in farmlands because of less crop varieties and intensive soil disturbance. Macrofauna are important components of the belowground biodiversity, and contribute to the soil ecosystem functions and soil processes. The response of soil macrofauna to cropping pattern is crucial for understanding the soil ecological dynamics and biodiversity conservation. Herein, we established an experiment of rice (Oryza sativa L.)-based double cropping system in Jiangsu Province, China since 2016 to evaluate the effects of rotation regimes on soil properties and soil macrofauna communities. The rice-based double cropping system included rice–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice-oilseed rape (Brassica campestris L.), rice-tiny vetch (Vicia hirsuta L.), rice-broad bean (Vicia faba L.), and rice-fallow. After 3-year rotations, soil macrofaunal biodiversity and trophic structure varied significantly with soil properties. The higher biodiversity indices were found in the tiny vetch (used as green manure in situ) and fallow fields. In addition, soil organic carbon (SOC), the main factor for shaping the soil environment and regulating the soil macrofaunal communities, was improved. While soil water content and pH were selected to predict each trophic richness and density in most of the optimal regression models, changes in soil macrofaunal communities should also be considered as comprehensive responses to the soil environments (food resources, microhabitats etc.) co-varying rotation regimes. Crop rotation with lower intensity of land use increased the complexity of soil macrofaunal trophic structure. Green manure fields or fallow after rice plantation promoted soil macrofaunal biodiversity in the rice-based cropping system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The present study investigates the impact of climate change on biodiversity loss using global data consisting of 115 countries. In this study, we measure biodiversity loss using data on the total number of threatened species of amphibians, birds, fishes, mammals, mollusks, plants, and reptiles. The data were compiled from the Red List published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). For climate change variables, we have included temperature, precipitation, and the number of natural disaster occurrences. As for the control variable, we have considered governance indicator and the level of economic development. By employing ordinary least square with robust standard error and robust regression (M-estimation), our results suggest that all three climate change variables – temperature, precipitation, and the number of natural disasters occurrences – increase biodiversity loss. Higher economic development also impacted biodiversity loss positively. On the other hand, good governance such as the control of corruption, regulatory quality, and rule of law reduces biodiversity loss. Thus, practicing good governance, promoting conservation of the environment, and the control of greenhouse gasses would able to mitigate biodiversity loss. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The re-release of golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia), from zoos into the wild, is considered to be an ex situ conservation success story. However, zoo-born golden lion tamarins have lower survival rates than their wild-born offspring, potentially due to deficient foraging and locomotion ‘survival skills’ acquired in captivity. The current study aimed to evaluate whether a puzzle feeder suspended and baited with different items could promote increased foraging and general activity in tamarins living in a zoo setting. A pair of tamarins at Woodland Park Zoo received the puzzle feeder in three conditions in an ABCACB experimental reversal design over a period of three months: an empty feeder and feeders baited with either fruit (raisins) or insects (mealworms). Food type affected behavior; time spent climbing increased when the feeder contained insects compared to fruit. Subjects interacted with the baited puzzle feeder device significantly more than the empty feeder, and use was highest within the first 30 minutes of exposure. Our results suggest that the puzzle feeders plus food were effective in increasing foraging and general activity. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Newly established populations of endangered species can help mitigate declines elsewhere and can be a valuable genetic reservoir. When these populations are located within anthropogenic habitats, they may also help mitigate the potential biodiversity loss created by urbanization. The Red-crowned Amazon Amazona viridigenalis is an endangered species that has become naturalized in multiple urban areas throughout the United States and Mexico, and these populations may currently outnumber the population within their historical habitat. While these urban populations may hold the majority of this endangered species, very few studies have analyzed the status and trends of this species, or of threatened parrots in general, in urban areas. Our study focuses on an urban Red-crowned Amazon population in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas: the only parrot population currently recognized as native to the United States. To determine a timeline of Red-crowned Amazon arrival and growth in the LRGV, we reviewed published literature and online citizen science databases. To quantify current population levels and trends, we conducted 412 surveys at all known roost sites throughout the LRGV from January 2016 through April 2019. We also quantified the ratio of adult and juvenile parrots at roosts. Our data suggest the species has been present in the LRGV consistently since the 1970s and showed rapid growth from the mid-1990s through roughly 2016. Roost counts suggest there is currently a minimum LRGV population of about 680 and the population has been relatively stable over the last 3.5 years. Productivity averaged 19% over three breeding seasons, suggesting successful internal reproduction. This study provides important baseline information for the management and conservation of Red-crowned Amazons in the region and provides a valuable timeline on the beginnings and trends of this recently established urban population of Amazona parrot. ©},

abstract={High rates of biodiversity loss caused by human-induced changes in the environment require new methods for large scale fauna monitoring and data analysis. While ecoacoustic monitoring is increasingly being used and shows promise, analysis and interpretation of the big data produced remains a challenge. Computer-generated acoustic indices potentially provide a biologically meaningful summary of sound, however, temporal autocorrelation, difficulties in statistical analysis of multi-index data and lack of consistency or transferability in different terrestrial environments have hindered the application of those indices in different contexts. To address these issues we investigate the use of time-series motif discovery and random forest classification of multi-indices through two case studies. We use a semi-automated workflow combining time-series motif discovery and random forest classification of multi-index (acoustic complexity, temporal entropy, and events per second) data to categorize sounds in unfiltered recordings according to the main source of sound present (birds, insects, geophony). Our approach showed more than 70% accuracy in label assignment in both datasets. The categories assigned were broad, but we believe this is a great improvement on traditional single index analysis of environmental recordings as we can now give ecological meaning to recordings in a semi-automated way that does not require expert knowledge and manual validation is only necessary for a small subset of the data. Furthermore, temporal autocorrelation, which is largely ignored by researchers, has been effectively eliminated through the time-series motif discovery technique applied here for the first time to ecoacoustic data. We expect that our approach will greatly assist researchers in the future as it will allow large datasets to be rapidly processed and labeled, enabling the screening of recordings for undesired sounds, such as wind, or target biophony (insects and birds) for biodiversity monitoring or bioacoustics research.

abstract={At the dawn of the Anthropocene, with the imminent threat of climate change delivering 3–4°C rise in temperature by the end of the century and biodiversity loss across the globe, restoration projects need to focus on re-establishing connectivity in vegetation structure at a landscape scale to facilitate the movement of wildlife. To achieve this requires long-term commitment, robust partnerships and planning and excellent planting technology underpinned by research. In this Special Issue, consisting of 15 papers, we present a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, science-based approach to environmental restoration, focused on a single geographic region, the Midlands of Tasmania. This introductory paper describes the breadth of the material covered in the series and sets the scene for following papers by describing the Midlands, its geography, climate and history, its extraordinary natural values as a biodiversity hotspot, the degree of degradation that has resulted from 200 years of intensive farming and the objectives of the Midlands restoration project. The Midlands also offers opportunities as a model system for landscape scale restoration given it is a circumscribed region, heterogeneous in land forms and land uses. Furthermore, in land management, there is a high level of cooperation between land owners, government departments, environmental agencies and university researchers. We describe how the contributions from a wide range of disciplines can be focused to meet the challenges of ecological restoration in highly altered agricultural landscapes. © 2021 Ecological Society of Australia and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.},

abstract={The common raven (Corvus corax; raven) is a large, highly intelligent passerine songbird with a Holarctic distribution attributable to a high degree of plasticity in its foraging and nesting behavior. Historically, ravens have received special attention in human culture, being either respected or vilified. In the western United States, ravens are exploiting the expanding human enterprise, which provides them with unintended subsidies of food, water, and breeding locations, allowing ravens to expand their range and increase in population density and resulting in raven depredation threatening species of conservation concern. From a conservation biology perspective, increased raven populations present a difficult challenge in managing human–wildlife conflict. Some raven control measures are effective empirically but present ethical dilemmas, are economically expensive, or are socially divisive. Current studies seek to better understand raven population dynamics in relation to human land use and to identify socially acceptable ways to ameliorate raven impacts on biodiversity in the American West. The purpose of this paper is to provide readers with summaries of important constraints in the search for how to address deleterious effects of an expanding raven population. Specifically, I describe ethical, legal, social, and biological constraints in relation to calls for lethal control of ravens. Despite these constraints, a conservation strategy may emerge through modeling the relationship between raven presence and reproduction of sensitive prey species, and developing a clearer understanding of raven ecology. Papers in this special issue explore raven population dynamics, conservation consequences, and conservation solutions in detail and reveal innovative ways to address the complex human– wildlife conflict presented by ravens © 2021, Human-Wildlife Interactions.

abstract={Animal-dispersed plants usually rely upon multiple dispersers. In many ecosystems, most of these interactions have yet to be explored; thus, documenting the extent of contribution of each animal partner to the reproduction and survival of plant species is key to understanding the ecology and evolution of animal-plant mutualism, as well as the potential responses of the ecological networks to biodiversity loss through defaunation. Here, by characterizing the outcomes and differences of the epizoochoric seed dispersal carried out by two species of frugivorous bats (Artibeus phaeotis and Uroderma convexum) in a Neotropical forest, we tested the prediction that, through their feeding activity, both bat species disperse and influence the subsequent seedling survival of multiple seed species. By direct sampling on bats' dispersing sites and surrounding areas, we found evidence of the dispersal of 2,310 seeds of eight plant species, of which 118 survived to become seedlings. The total density of seeds and the seedling survival were significantly higher in areas directly influenced by the bats (i.e., feeding roosts) than in peripheral areas. Positive density-dependent effects nevertheless were detected in both sampling areas (feeding roosts and peripheral areas). Interspecific comparisons showed that despite both bat species having similar dispersal outcomes, seedlings in peripheral areas related to A. phaeotis have better survival rates. Our results demonstrate that both bat species primarily disperse by epizoochoric means seeds of various tree species at several localities in the study site. This result, together with the positive density-dependent effects, suggests that bats are moving seeds away from maternal trees and depositing them in locations where some of the seeds can germinate, establish, and survive, thereby highlighting the positive contribution of these bat species to the reproductive success of trees inhabiting Neotropical habitats. Our results contribute to the growing knowledge of frugivorous interactions on hyperdiverse forests and the role of small vertebrates on seed dispersal mutualisms. © 2021 The Author(s).},

abstract={Globally, the resources devoted to biodiversity conservation are insufficient to prevent biodiversity loss, forcing conservation agencies to prioritize which species receive active protection. Accordingly, we developed an objective method for prioritizing the terrestrial vertebrates of Saudi Arabia, a country with limited baseline ecological data and limited conservation effort. Ninety-seven species were regarded as High Conservation Priority on the basis that they are listed as globally or regionally threatened and/or have more than 50% of their range within Saudi Arabia. We then scored these 97 species according to measures of extinction risk, level of endemicity, national responsibility, and phylogenetic distinctness to create a ranked list of High Conservation Priority species. The ten highest conservation priority species in Saudi Arabia are all freshwater fish or small reptiles, with the highest ranked species being the critically endangered Arabian Bream Acanthobrama hadiyahensis. We developed GIS heat maps of the summed conservation priority scores for the 97 High Conservation Priority species, which reveal the Asir Mountains as the highest conservation priority area within the Kingdom. The method we developed can be used on any group of species in any geographic area and can be easily revised as additional data arise. © TCRP Foundation 2021},

abstract={Globally, illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade can drive biodiversity loss. Understanding which product attributes consumers consider when deciding between products of threatened species or alternatives, is key for conservation interventions. Labeled Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) are underutilized in wildlife trade literature but can aid this understanding. In labeled DCEs, the alternatives presented to respondents have specific names (e.g., paracetamol) as opposed to being generic bundles (e.g., option A). We used a labeled DCE to assess young adult preferences toward “cooling water” used to treat fever and heatiness (a traditional Chinese medicine state of illness) in Singapore. One popular cooling water contains saiga horn, made from Critically Endangered Saiga tatarica antelope. Data from 639 university-enrolled respondents were analyzed using latent class models. Middle- to high-income Chinese Singaporeans were the respondents most likely to choose saiga horn. Overall, however, respondents significantly preferred lower price products sold in nearby outlets—suggesting that for young adults in Singapore, saiga horn cooling water may be substitutable if its physical and financial availability is reduced. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Conservation efforts must be evidence-based, so rapid and economically feasible methods should be used to quantify diversity and distribution patterns. We have attempted to overcome current impediments to the gathering of biodiversity data by using integrative phylogenomic and three mtDNA fragment analyses. As a model, we sequenced the Metriorrhynchini beetle fauna, sampled from ~700 localities in three continents. The species-rich dataset included ~6,500 terminals, ~1,850 putative species delimited at 5% uncorrected pairwise threshold, possibly ~1,000 of them unknown to science. Neither type of data could alone answer our questions on biodiversity and phylogeny. The phylogenomic backbone enabled the integrative delimitation of robustly defined natural genus-group units that will inform future research. Using constrained mtDNA analysis, we identified the spatial structure of species diversity, very high specieslevel endemism, and a biodiversity hotspot in New Guinea. We suggest that focused field research and subsequent laboratory and bioinformatic workflow steps would substantially accelerate the inventorying of any hyperdiverse tropical group with several thousand species. The outcome would be a scaffold for the incorporation of further data from environmental sequencing and ecological studies. The database of sequences could set a benchmark for the spatiotemporal evaluation of biodiversity, would support evidencebased conservation planning, and would provide a robust framework for systematic, biogeographic, and evolutionary studies. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

abstract={Aquatic ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic activity and climate change. The changes in flow regimes in Lithuanian lowland rivers due to the operation of hydropower plants (HPPs) and the impact of altered flow on some fish species have already been studied. The impact of climate change on future natural river runoff and the structure of fish assemblages was also investigated. However, it is still unknown how the combined effect of climate change and flow regulation related to hydropower generation may affect fish assemblages in the downstream river reaches below the Lithuanian HPPs. In this study, the physical habitat modelling system MesoHABSIM was used to simulate spatial and temporal changes in aquatic habitats availability for different fish species under the influence of HPP at different climate change scenarios. Changes in the available habitat were assessed for common fish species in four HPP-affected rivers representing different hydrological regions of Lithuania. The modelling results showed that the operation of HPP under climate change conditions in most rivers could be beneficial for small benthic fish species such as gudgeon Gobio gobio and stone loach Barbatula barbatula. Meanwhile, for larger fish species (e.g., chub Squalius cephalus and vimba Vimba vimba) the alteration in the temporal availability of suitable habitat was relatively higher. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an important tool for conservation but can be victims of their own success - higher fish biomass within MPAs create incentives to poach. This insight underpins the finding that fishing persists in most MPAs worldwide, and it raises questions about MPA monitoring and enforcement. We propose a novel institution to enhance MPA design - a 'Conservation Finance Area (CFA)' - that utilizes leased fishing zones inside of MPAs, fed by spillover, to finance monitoring and enforcement and achieve greater conservation success. Using a bioeconomic model we show that CFAs can fully finance enforcement, deter illegal fishing, and ultimately maximize fish biomass. Moreover, we show that unless a large, exogenous, and perpetual enforcement budget is available, implementing a CFA in a no-take MPA would always result in higher biomass than without. We also explore real-world enabling conditions, providing a plausible funding pathway to improve outcomes for existing and future MPAs. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Expansion of oil palm plantation areas in Thailand, the world's third-largest oil palm producer, for food and fuel may sometimes encroach on forest areas, leading to biodiversity loss. Thailand is in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, which contains high species richness. This study assesses the impacts of oil palm plantations on bird and insect species richness from land use in the five regions of Thailand by using the countryside Species-Area Relationship model. Data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and Thailand's Land Development Department (LDD) were used for species occurrence and land use data, respectively. This study focuses on the deforestation for oil palm because it poses the highest risk for wildlife compared to other habitats. The taxon affinity and regional characterization factors show the risk to wildlife (birds and insects) in the formerly natural habitat areas (i.e., deciduous, evergreen, and mangrove forests). The results show that the possibility of animal survival in former mangrove forests is higher than in other forests upon occupation, as demonstrated by the taxon affinity. Likewise, deforestation in the northern region causes the least species loss per area, as demonstrated by the lowest average regional characterization factor, because species densities are lowest. However, the impacts on species richness depend on the taxon and the combination of the region and the forest type. While the overall goal should be to minimize the expansion of oil palm, this study indicates in which forest type and Thai region land occupation causes less regional bird and insect species loss. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Historical DNA analysis of archival samples has added new dimensions to population genetic studies, enabling spatiotemporal approaches for reconstructing population history and informing conservation management. Here we tested the efficacy of Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing (GT-seq) for collecting targeted single nucleotide polymorphism genotypic data from archival scale samples, and applied this approach to a study of kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in Kluane National Park and Reserve (KNPR; Yukon, Canada) that underwent a severe 12-year population decline followed by a rapid rebound. We genotyped archival scales sampled pre-crash and contemporary fin clips collected post-crash, revealing high coverage (> 90% average genotyping across all individuals) and low genotyping error (< 0.01% within-libraries, 0.60% among-libraries) despite the relatively poor quality of recovered DNA. We observed slight decreases in expected heterozygosity, allelic diversity, and effective population size post-crash, but none were significant, suggesting genetic diversity was retained despite the severe demographic contraction. Genotypic data also revealed the genetic distinctiveness of a now extirpated population just outside of KNPR, revealing biodiversity loss at the northern edge of the species distribution. More broadly, we demonstrated GT-seq as a valuable tool for collecting genome-wide data from archival samples to address basic questions in ecology and evolution, and inform applied research in wildlife conservation and fisheries management. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Global environmental change exerts growing pressure on biodiversity. Anthropogenic climate and land use change are particularly important drivers of biodiversity loss. While their effects on biodiversity have been widely studied individually, interactions among them are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effects of two common drivers of global change, increased temperature and nitrogen fertilization, on host-plant quality and herbivore performance in the butterfly Lycaena tityrus. We show that butterfly performance was positively affected by plants grown at increased temperatures and nitrogen fertilization, the latter being in line with the nitrogen limitation hypothesis. Effects were largely consistent across treatments; that is, nitrogen deposition and temperature did not interact strongly to affect herbivore performance. Overall, females suffered more strongly than males from poor host-plant quality. Our study demonstrates changes in host-plant quality caused by variation in temperature and nitrogen availability, which induced indirect effects in an herbivore. Such indirect effects of global environmental change are an important source of variation and should be considered in order to reduce uncertainties with regard to the effects of global change on biodiversity. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Once exploited for fur, meat, and extracting the yellowish exudate called castoreum, the Eurasian beaver disappeared from Romania during the eighteenth century. After, the reintroductions carried out two decades ago are currently thriving in the Danube River basin. Using nine nSSR markers, we analysed samples from 98 individuals, and we found no genetic substructure, suggesting high dispersal and gene flow capabilities. The stepwise mutation model (SMM) indicated the existence of a recent genetic bottleneck, though the Eurasian beaver retains high levels of genetic diversity and population growth facilitated variation in nSSR loci. A fine-scale spatial correlation in females was detected, contrasting with males’ dispersal on longer distances. While the movement and establishment of individuals’ new territories were made under natural predation pressure, the mix following natural expansion improved the fitness and could contribute to a higher genetic diversity than the source population. With any reintroduction, a focus on capturing individuals from various geographic origins, as well as securing many and suitable founding individuals (adults, subadults, and juveniles) with mixed origins, could secure the post-genetic bottleneck recovery and higher genetic diversity. Beyond this conservation success, future management strategies should consider building a National Action Plan (NAP) for the species, including a permanent genetic monitoring programme for Eurasian beaver. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Although global assessments provide evidence of biodiversity decline, some have questioned the strength of the evidence, with local assemblage studies often showing a more balanced picture of biodiversity change. The multifaceted nature of biodiversity and imperfect monitoring datasets may partially explain these findings. Here, using an extensive dataset, we find significant biodiversity loss in the native avifauna of the European Union (EU). We estimate a decline of 17–19% in the overall breeding bird abundance since 1980: a loss of 560–620 million individual birds. Both total and proportional declines in bird numbers are high among species associated with agricultural land. The distribution of species’ population growth rates (ln) is centered close to zero, with numerical decline driven by substantial losses in abundant species. Our work supports previous assessments indicating substantial recent biodiversity loss and calls to reduce the threat of extinctions and restore species’ abundances, for the sake of nature and people. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Apart from being the main cause of biodiversity loss, humans are also essential for sustainability and biological conservation. Regulations for the conservation of threatened species are key to respond to this challenge. Here we evaluate the efficacy of mandatory regulations in Spain, a decentralized country, for the effective protection of threatened terrestrial vertebrates. We studied the association between the number of both “vulnerable” and “endangered” species on regional lists of threatened species and approved management plans for such species (mandatory) with ecological (e.g. percentage of forest and agricultural areas), social (e.g. environmental awareness and GPD per capita) and geographical (e.g. total and protected areas) variables on the regional scale. Our results showed that an approved management plan is available for only 20% of threatened terrestrial vertebrates and there were important taxonomical and regional biases. Higher protection levels appeared in regions with higher percentages of protected area, more citizens’ environmental awareness, lower GPD per capita and shorter regional lists. Herpetofauna has fewer approved management plans than mammals or birds. Our results highlight the importance of integrating the perspective, knowledge and practices of all stakeholders (Academia, governments and society) to effectively apply environmental regulations. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={The negative impact of urbanization on biodiversity can be buffered by blue (e.g., rivers, ponds) and green (e.g., parks, forests) spaces. However, to prevent biodiversity loss and reduce the risk of local extinctions, blue and green spaces need to be connected by corridors, so that organisms may disperse between sites. Landscape connectivity affects local community composition and metacommunity dynamics by facilitating dispersal. The goal of this study was to test the relative roles of pond environmental properties, spatial structure, and functional landscape connectivity on differentiation of invertebrate metacommunities in urban ponds in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. We characterized functional connectivity as blue connectivity (distance to water bodies), green connectivity (land use), and combined blue-green connectivity. We estimated functional connectivity by using electrical circuit theory to identify dispersal corridors. Interestingly, while circuit theory is often used in single-taxon studies, this method has rarely been applied to multiple taxa forming a metacommunity, as we have done in this study. Indeed, our study contributes toward an increased focus on the role of dispersal at the metacommunity level. We determined that functional connectivity was the most important factor in explaining community differentiation, with the local environment contributing comparatively little, and spatial structure the least. Combined blue-green functional connectivity had a major influence on structuring urban pond communities, explaining 7.8% of the variance in community composition across ponds. Furthermore, we found that increased functional connectivity was associated with an increase in the number of species. In summary, our results suggest that to preserve biodiversity in urban ponds, it is important to enhance functional connectivity, and that open green spaces could augment blue corridors in maintaining functional connectivity in urban pond metacommunities. To generalize these findings, future urban biodiversity studies should compare how functional connectivity affects metacommunities across multiple major cities. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Biodiversity-sensitive cities can contribute to reconnect humans with nature and halt global biodiversity loss. Achieving biodiversity-sensitive cities is challenging, especially in regions threatened by growing urbanization. To inform urban management and planning in a global biodiversity hotspot, we conducted a multi-scale assessment of drivers of Neotropical birds in the capital city of Santiago de Chile. We investigate the influence of local and landscape variables on native bird species richness and abundance. We surveyed birds and vegetation in 449 sampling points distributed across the city. Native bird species richness was greater in areas with greater shrub and woody vegetation cover at the local scale. Native bird species richness was also greater with high vegetation density in the surrounding landscape and near to an urban boundary. Native birds were abundant in areas with large woody vegetation cover at both local and landscape scales, high vegetation density in the surrounding landscape, near to an urban park and near to an urban boundary. Additive effects of vegetation at different spatial scales suggest that combining local and landscape management, planning and design will be best to preserve native birds in a large city. Although native birds are species rich and abundant near the urban fringe and decrease towards the interior of the city, local-scale management of habitat encouraging shrub and tree planting and landscape-scale actions such as targeting high levels of vegetation (including woody cover) and providing a well-distributed network of urban parks will help sustain native birds across the city. Greening actions at local and landscape-scale will contribute to achieving biodiversity-sensitive cities, providing benefits for people and nature. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={In the face of ongoing habitat degradation and the biodiversity crisis, natural reserves are important refuges for wildlife. Since most free-living organisms serve as hosts to parasites, the diverse communities in protected areas can be expected to provide suitable habitats for a species-rich parasite fauna. However, to date, assessments of parasite diversity in protected nature reserves are rare. To expand our knowledge of parasite communities in natural habitats, we examined 1994 molluscs belonging to 15 species for trematode infections in a central European natural reserve. The parasitological examination revealed an overall prevalence of 17.3% and a total species richness of 40 trematode species. However, the parasite diversity and prevalence did not differ markedly from trematode communities in non-protected environments, which might be partly explained by a dilution effect caused by a high number of non-host organisms in our study system. The proportion of complex and long life cycles of parasites in the present study is high, indicating complex biotic interactions. We conclude that life cycle complexity, in addition to parasite diversity and trematode species richness, can provide valuable information on ecosystem health and should therefore be considered in future studies. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Over-exploitation of wildlife especially bushmeat trade is the second most important threat to animal biodiversity. This also applies to Northern Angola but data on bushmeat and hunting techniques for this region are rare. Therefore, we study the most common hunting techniques, frequently captured species, and their economic value, and discuss the local resource use in relation to Angolan law and urgent global crises like the loss of biodiversity, the food supply in South African countries, and the risk of zoonoses. We recorded bushmeat hunting in 27 localities in the province of Uíge, accompanied hunters along their snare lines and interviewed additional 20 locals. Seven main types of snares and traps and their characteristics were defined. Hunters own on average 92 ± 128.7 snares and traps and capture about 25.3 ± 23.6 animals monthly. In total, respondents recognized 28 species of mammals of which one is considered as extinct and two as very rare. The majority of recorded species are hunted regularly. Rodents are most commonly caught followed by primates and duikers. Harvesting rates decrease with species’ body size, leading to high economic value of and achievable prices for rare, large animals. Overall, our results document the hunting pressure on mammals and the persisting popularity of bushmeat in Northern Angola which poses an imminent threat to remaining mammal populations. Moreover, it endangers ecosystem integrity, rural livelihoods, and human health through the risk of new zoonoses. Our findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable solutions. The Angolan government should play a more active role in enforcing existing hunting legislation to reduce illegal bushmeat trade. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Urbanisation is increasing globally, degrading terrestrial and freshwater habitats and reducing faunal and floral richness. Whilst the potential for garden ponds to serve as important biodiversity resources in urban areas has been documented in a limited number of studies, quantifying the contribution of garden ponds to urban freshwater diversity has been largely neglected. This study aims to quantify the taxonomic richness, community composition and conservation value of aquatic macroinvertebrates in domestic garden and non-urban ponds. Taxonomic richness was significantly lower in garden ponds than non-urban ponds at an alpha and gamma scale. A greater richness of Odonata, Coleoptera, Gastropoda and Hemiptera were recorded in non-urban ponds. Garden ponds were found to support compositionally different macroinvertebrate communities compared to non-urban ponds, influenced by variation in water depth and conductivity. A total of 23 taxa were recorded from garden ponds only. Non-urban ponds had a significantly higher conservation value compared to garden ponds (87% of garden ponds were of low or moderate conservation value, while only 35% of non-urban ponds were in these categories). Although garden ponds currently support limited macroinvertebrate diversity and have lower conservation value, they contribute to the regional species pool and their potential to limit future urban biodiversity loss is significant. Given their high abundance and popularity within the urban landscape, clear guidance is required for pond-owners on how to best manage garden ponds to support and sustain biodiversity. For this to be achieved, research is required to increase fundamental understanding of urban pond ecology, and the development of evidence led garden pond management practices. © 2021 Gesellschaft für Ökologie},

abstract={Conservation depends on acquiring timely knowledge on species’ ecology to alleviate the risks of biodiversity loss driven by anthropogenic stressors. Himalayan freshwater ecosystems are exceedingly threatened by the compounding effects of rising developmental pressure and climate change, jeopardizing biodiversity nested within this imperilled landscape. Riverine ecosystems of the Himalayan foothill forests of India are a stronghold of the vulnerable smooth-coated otter populations. This study entails the understanding of resource utilisation by the smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) in terms of habitat use and dietary composition in seven rivers along the Himalayan foothills in India. We surveyed 121.09 km of rivers for otter signs and associated habitat variables. Using Generalised Linear Models, we assessed the factors influencing otter habitat use. We estimated the relative abundance and catch per unit effort of fish species and evaluated otter diet based on spraint samples (n = 120) using frequency of occurrence and score-bulk estimate methods. Habitat use by otters is governed by a combination of habitat components, which are intricately linked to different requirements such as feeding, grooming, and denning. We found that habitat use was positively associated with channel depth, moderate vegetation, and bank substrate types – bedrock, boulders, sand, and grass. Whereas, increasing distance to escape cover, sparse vegetation, channel width, and anthropogenic disturbance negatively influenced habitat use. Dietary analyses revealed that relatively abundant fish species viz., Tor putitora and Barilius vagra, predominated the diet of otters. Echoing the principles of optimal foraging theory, our results indicated that small-medium sized fishes of the size range 79.05–199.92 mm, were consumed more often, and larger fishes (> 263.24 mm) were consumed opportunistically. Our findings provide important conservation insights on the status of the smooth-coated otter, their interactions with different habitat components, and dietary spectrum in rivers of the Himalayan foothills. Overall, our study gives cognizance to the importance of preserving freshwater and riparian habitats to ensure the persistence of otters and their prey in the region. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Urbanization and associated accumulation of solid waste at landfills is attracting large numbers of wild avifauna for food subsidies and transforming landfills into new habitats by changing the wild profile of native species. This study aims to establish the baseline situation of avian diversity and abundance on various land uses including the landfill at Gujranwala in northeastern Punjab, Pakistan, and understanding the impact of urban solid waste in changing bird behavior. Field observations in a variety of land uses (agriculture, forest, lake, urban and landfill) in summer 2018 using the point count method for bird census determined the baseline for 56 species (birds/10 min) indicating a significant change in native avian composition. PCA analysis showed four clusters based on the nature of habitat and species behavior. Agriculture land was found to be the highest (H'= 3.394) and landfill the lowest (H'= 1.414) in biodiversity. However, landfill site registered the most number of birds (>9000). Among twenty species recorded at the landfill, four species viz., house crow, common myna, grey-throated martin and bank myna, recorded >95% of the total population of birds. Species evenness was the highest for lake site (E= 0.938) indicating the most balanced type of ecosystem. Sparrows were found only in urban areas. Two opportunist species (house crow and common myna) were found to be the most successful in exploiting available resources. Foraging of birds in layers with aggressive species feeding first and development of new learning mechanisms pointed to the change in bird behavior at the landfill. This work highlights the need for a new research field 'Landfill Ecology' to study the impact of landfill on biota including avian, in a time when biodiversity loss is the hottest global issue. © 2021 Zoological Society of Pakistan.},

abstract={Rapid biodiversity loss has triggered decades of research on the relationships between biodiversity and community stability. Recent studies highlighted the importance of species traits for understanding biodiversity–stability relationships. The species with high growth rates (‘fast’ species) are expected to be less resistant to environmental stress but recover faster if disturbed; in contrast, the species with slow growth rates (‘slow’ species) can be more resistant but recover more slowly if disturbed. Such a ‘fast–slow’ trait continuum provides a new perspective for understanding community stability, but its validity has mainly been examined in plant communities. Here, we investigate how ‘fast–slow’ trait composition, together with species richness and environmental factors, regulate avian community stability at a continental scale. We used bird population records from the North American Breeding Bird Survey during 1988–2017 and defined avian community stability as the temporal invariability of total community biomass. We calculated species richness and the community–weighted mean (CWM) and functional diversity (FD) of four key life-history traits, including body size, nestling period (i.e. period of egg incubation and young bird fledging), life span and clutch size (i.e. annual total number of eggs). Environmental factors included temperature, precipitation and leaf area index (LAI). Our analyses showed that avian community stability was mainly driven by the CWM of the ‘fast–slow’ trait. Communities dominated by ‘fast’ species (i.e. species with small body size, short nestling period and life span and large clutch size) were more stable than those dominated by ‘slow’ species (i.e. species with large body size, long nestling period and life span and small clutch size). Species richness and the FD of the ‘fast–slow’ trait explained much smaller proportions of variation in avian community stability. Temperature had direct positive effects on avian community stability, while precipitation and leaf area index affected community stability indirectly by influencing species richness and trait composition. Our study demonstrates that composition of ‘fast–slow’ traits is the major biotic driver of avian community stability over North America. Temperature is the most important abiotic factor, but its effect is weaker than that of the ‘fast–slow’ trait. An integrated framework combining ‘fast–slow’ trait composition and temperature is needed to understand the response of avian communities in a changing environment.

abstract={Many regions across the globe are shifting to more arid climates. For shallow lakes, decreasing rainfall volume and timing, changing regional wind patterns and increased evaporation rates alter water regimes so that dry periods occur more frequently and for longer. Drier conditions may affect fauna directly and indirectly through altered physicochemical conditions in lakes. Although many studies have predicted negative effects of such changes on aquatic biodiversity, empirical studies demonstrating these effects are rare. Global warming has caused severe climatic drying in southwestern Australia since the 1970s, so we aimed to determine whether lakes in this region showed impacts on lake hydroperiod, water quality, and α, β and γ diversity of lake invertebrates from 1998 to 2011. Seventeen lakes across a range of salinities were sampled biennially in spring in the Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions of Western Australia. Multivariate analyses were used to identify changes in α, β and γ diversity and examine patterns in physicochemical data. Salinity and average rainfall partially explained patterns in invertebrate richness and assemblage composition. Climatic drying was associated with significant declines in lake depth, increased frequency of dry periods, and reduced α and γ diversity (γ declined from ~300 to ~100 taxa from 1998 to 2011 in the 17 wetlands). In contrast, β diversity remained consistently high, because each lake retained a distinct fauna. Mean α diversity per-lake declined both in lakes that dried and lakes that did not dry out, but lakes which retained a greater proportion of their maximum depth retained more α diversity. Accumulated losses in α diversity caused the decline in γ diversity likely through shrinking habitat area, fewer stepping stones for dispersal and loss of specific habitat types. Biodiversity loss is thus likely from lakes in drying regions globally. Management actions will need to sustain water depth in lakes to prevent biodiversity loss. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={The effective conservation of mammals on the brink of extinction requires an integrated socio-ecological approach, yet the updated ecological knowledge of species remains fundamental. This study brings spatiotemporal behaviour, population structure, age-specific survival rates, and population size estimate of the Western Derby eland (WDE) in the Niokolo Koba National Park (NKNP), Senegal, investigated during dry seasons 2017 and 2018. WDE was strongly localised in the core area of NKNP (&lt; 5%), active throughout the day with the highest peak in the hottest daytime, with a mean group size 7.6 ± SE 8.9. The adult sex ratio was female-biased and showed low annual adult male survival rates. The population consisted of high proportion of juveniles, whilst adults did not exceed 40%. The estimated population density was 0.138 WDE/km2 (± 0.0102) and estimated size 195 WDE in NKNP (CI95 from 54 to 708 individuals). Findings highlighted that the WDE population has potential to expand in the NKNP, due to an underutilized capacity. The age-specific vital rates indicate adult males as the most vulnerable; suggesting either an increase in the large predators’ population, livestock encroachment pressure, and/or poaching. Findings imply that targeted monitoring with science-based interpretation may bring forward strong conservation solutions to the protected area management decision-makers. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={While the amphibian disease chytridiomycosis is causing ongoing population declines and biodiversity losses around the globe, efficient mitigation strategies are lacking. The free-living zoospores of the causative agents of this disease, the chytrid pathogens Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), are a potential food source for filter-feeding micropredators as part of the aquatic food web. While consumption of zoospores can lower environmental pathogen loads, alternative food sources may interfere with pathogen removal rates. We compared the ability of three filter-feeding zooplankton species, the cladoceran Daphnia magna, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and the ostracod Heterocypris incongruens, to remove Bd zoospores in water and investigated the effect of alternative food sources, the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Chlorella vulgaris, on zoospore ingestion by D. magna. Daphnia magna was the only micropredator candidate that effectively removed Bd zoospores from its environment, with an average removal rate of 1,012 ± 542 GE ind.−1 hr−1 within our test system. High concentrations (1 × 105 cells/ml) of large and easily ingestible P. subcapitata reduced pathogen removal rates, whereas the small and less edible C. vulgaris did not interfere with pathogen removal. Synthesis and applications. We showed that Daphnia spp., which are keystone species in all sorts of aquatic habitats worldwide, are promising target agents for biologically mitigating chytridiomycosis infections and how natural food sources may interfere with this strategy. We also suggest potential management actions for biological disease mitigation, aiming to optimize environmental conditions for these target filter feeders, thereby reducing pathogen densities and eventually infection pressure in amphibian hosts. Examples of such management actions include, but are not limited to, removal of planktivorous fish, habitat restoration, nutrient control or agrochemical regulation in the vicinity of amphibian breeding ponds. Further studies, including field trials, are needed to confirm the effects of pathogen consumption on infection dynamics in natural situations and investigate the impact of intervention actions. © 2021 British Ecological Society},

abstract={Species that depend on anthropogenic waste for food can remove pathogens that pose health risks to humans and livestock, thereby saving lives and money. Quantifying these benefits is rare, yet can lead to innovative conservation solutions. To assess these benefits, we examined the feeding ecology and population size of peri-urban spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta in Mekelle, Ethiopia. We integrated these field data into a disease transmission model to predict: (a) the number of anthrax and bovine tuberculosis (bTB) infections arising in humans and livestock from infected carcass waste and (b) the costs associated with treating these infections and losing livestock. We compared these public health and economic outcomes under two scenarios: (a) hyenas are present and (b) the counterfactual, hyenas are absent. We estimated that hyenas annually remove 4.2% (207 tonnes) of the total carcass waste disposed of by residents and businesses in Mekelle. Furthermore, the scavenging behaviour of hyenas annually prevents five infections of anthrax and bTB in humans, and 140 infections in cattle, sheep and goats. This disease control service potentially saves USD 52,165 due to the treatment costs and livestock loss avoided. Synthesis and applications. This human–hyena interaction in Ethiopia is evidence that large carnivores can contribute to human health and economy. To retain these benefits and maintain tolerance of hyenas, we recommend introducing education programmes to promote safe outdoor behaviour around hyenas, training watchdogs to alert residents of hyena presence, constructing bomas to protect livestock from hyena attacks, and preserving the hyenas' access to carcass waste to reduce their dependency on livestock predation. With humans and carnivores coming more frequently into contact, understanding and communicating how these species can benefit humanity will be critical to motivating human–carnivore coexistence worldwide. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Landscape-scale agricultural intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Highly mobile species, such as aerial invertebrates may be disproportionately affected by land cover at large spatial scales due to their ability to disperse. Assessing the efficacy of environmentally friendly farming, such as Agri-Environment Schemes (AES), therefore, requires establishing the influence of land cover beyond focal farms or fields, contextualising the impact of agricultural management. This study measured the response of aerial invertebrate functional groups to AES management in improved and semi-improved upland grasslands accounting for spatial autocorrelation and multi-scale effects of land cover within buffers varying from 100 m to 5 km at 88 paired fields. Total aerial invertebrate abundance and diversity, including detritivores, herbivores, nectivores, predators and parasitoids all responded to different land cover types at varying scales indicative of highly complex and idiosyncratic functional group responses to landscape.After accounting for spatial autocorrelation and multi-scale landscape composition, total aerial invertebrate abundance was unaffected by agricultural management but diversity was (5%) higher in AES than conventionally managed fields. Detritivore (mostly Mycetophilidae fungus gnat) diversity and abundance were higher in AES than conventional fields, but only on improved grasslands, while predator (adult Muscidae house fly, Scathophagidae dung fly and Dolichopodidae long-legged fly) diversity was lower but abundance higher in AES than conventional fields. Aerial invertebrate herbivores (Anthomyiidae root-maggot flies and Cecidomyiidae gall midges and gnats), nectivores (Syrphidae hoverflies and Apoidea bees) and parasitoids (Ichneumonidae wasps) responded to landscape composition, but not agricultural management. Synthesis and Applications: this study suggests that landscape composition drives aerial invertebrate functional group diversity and abundance at multiple spatial scales. Nevertheless, the responses of some functional groups (detritivores and predators) to local agricultural management suggest that AES management may contribute to the maintenance or enhancement of ecosystem service delivery (nutrient cycling and pest biocontrol). Explicitly accounting for multi-scale landscape effects is necessary when assessing the impact of agricultural management on highly mobile taxa. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={1. The Indian Thar Desert has lost much of its grasslands over the last few decades, mainly due to land-use change from pastoralism to agriculture. Expanding croplands and intensifying grazing pressures are popularly hypothesized to be the major drivers of biodiversity loss in the region. Our study aims to investigate the effects of contemporary land-use change on bird communities of the Western Thar Desert. 2. We surveyed 59 randomly laid line transects in a ~2000 sq.km study area, to quantify parameters of bird community structure in three predominant land-cover types viz. protected grasslands, rangelands, and fallow croplands. Fieldwork for the study was conducted in the dry season (winter and summer) between December 2018 and April 2019. 3. During winter, overall bird species richness and abundance was highest in protected grasslands followed by fallow croplands and rangelands. Protected grasslands also had a higher abundance of diet and habitat specialists. Compared to protected grasslands, density was lower in fallow croplands and rangelands for 35% and 10% of species, respectively. A majority of the negatively affected species were insectivorous grassland specialists. 4. Contrary to the pattern in winter, overall bird species richness, abundance, composition, and guild structure in summer was similar across the three land-use types. Only one of the 17 analysed species had significantly lower density in modified land-use types. 5. Overall, protected grasslands were the best habitat for birds and specifically important for diet and habitat specialists, more so during the winter. Rangelands and fallow croplands sustained most generalists at comparable densities but had severe negative impacts on specialist species. 6. Synthesis and application: Our results point out that low-intensity agro-pastoral land-uses can supplement, but not replace, protected areas in conservation of Thar Desert's avifaunal diversity. This is in consonance with the idea of managing dryland habitats as agro-grassland mosaics with embedded protected areas, in order to reconcile human needs and biodiversity conservation at a landscape scale. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Amphibian chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has caused the greatest known loss of biodiversity due to an infectious disease. We used Bd infection data from quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays of amphibian skin swabs collected across Chile during 2008–2018 to model Bd occurrence with the aim to determine bioclimatic and anthropogenic variables associated with Bd infection. Also, we used Bd presence/absence records to identify geographical Bd high-risk areas and compare Bd prevalence and infection loads between amphibian families, ecoregions, and host ecology. Data comprised 4155 Bd-specific qPCR assays from 162 locations across a latitudinal gradient of 3700 km (18º to 51ºS). Results showed a significant clustering of Bd associated with urban centres and anthropogenically highly disturbed ecosystems in central-south Chile. Both Bd prevalence and Bd infection loads were higher in aquatic than terrestrial amphibian species. Our model indicated positive associations of Bd prevalence with altitude, temperature, precipitation and human-modified landscapes. Also, we found that macroscale drivers, such as land use change and climate, shape the occurrence of Bd at the landscape level. Our study provides with new evidence that can improve the effectiveness of strategies to mitigate biodiversity loss due to amphibian chytridiomycosis. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Aim: Freshwater ecosystems and their biota are severely endangered by global change today, and predicted extinction levels are skyrocketing for many taxa. Most studies have focused on entire clades, while approaches testing for selective extinction risk with respect to ecological traits are rare. As studies are typically based on modern faunas, the generality of the detected patterns in the context of the current biodiversity crisis remains uncertain. We use a dataset of fossil and modern freshwater gastropods to investigate extinction probability in dependence of lifestyle and geographic distribution. Location: Europe, Miocene to present-day. Methods: We performed generalized linear mixed modelling to test for a relationship between extinction probability and taxonomic group (Caenogastropoda vs. Hygrophila, reflecting different lifestyles) and range size, while using time as random effect. Extinction and survival of modern representatives was predicted based on IUCN conservation status. To identify the types of faunas with elevated extinction risk with respect to lifestyle, we tested for a relationship between the proportion of Caenogastropoda and lake surface area and geological duration using generalized linear models. Results: We found a clear relationship between extinction likelihood and lifestyle, which is linked to differences in range sizes and is independent of geological time. Caenogastropoda are more prone to go extinct. A strong positive relationship between the proportion of Caenogastropoda and geological duration was found, showing that Caenogastropoda are more dominant in long-lived lakes. Main conclusions: The elevated extinction risk of caenogastropods is linked to their smaller geographic ranges, which reflects their comparably poor colonization ability, and urges enhanced conservation efforts. Their high diversity and high degree of endemism in long-lived lakes render, especially these archives of evolution important conservators of biodiversity. As most of these lakes are under severe anthropogenic pressure, concerted conservation measures are needed to ensure the survival of their unique biota. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Abstract: Traditional and extensively used agricultural lands maintain and protect high levels of biological diversity. This diversity is in decline due to land use intensification and abandonment. Natural and semi-natural grasslands of the Carpathian lowlands have become endangered over the 19th century. However, some remains of former wetlands have survived land use change in the Bereg Region (North-eastern Hungary and Eastern Ukraine). We surveyed Orthopterans as sensitive indicators of habitat structure and microclimate in grasslands. We identified three different Orthoptera assemblages and their character species. Although rare and especially valuable species were not found in the studied sites, the species rich remains of wetlands still protected relics of former wildlife of wetlands. Understanding the quantitative character of the assemblages, ratios of life forms and particularly co-occurrences of their character species (Chorthippus dorsatus, Leptophyes albovittata, Tettigonia viridissima and Ruspolia nitidula) and use of Grasshopper Conservation Indexes (GCI) can help to identify remaining good quality patches with highest conservation value and monitoring. Implications for insect conservation: The focused management of these habitats with reconsideration of the traditional water management can be effective practice for wetland management and Orthoptera conservation. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={The End-Triassic mass extinction event [ETE] (201.5 Ma) marks a drastic turnover and loss of > 50% of marine biodiversity. Suggested environmental factors include extreme climate change and global carbon-cycle perturbations linked to Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) volcanism. Considerable attention has been paid to disentangling the causes and selectivity of the ETE, whilst downplaying the patterns of change in the structure and functioning of marine paleofauna. Here we provide detailed quantitative information from across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary at Waterloo Bay, Larne, Northern Ireland, to describe patterns of changes in different palaeoecological parameters across the ETE. The analysis was based on abundance data of species sampled from approximately 1 m intervals through the sequence. Dominance and richness were estimated using rarefaction techniques and β-diversity index, and distinctness diversity indices were calculated. Changes in species composition were evaluated by multivariate analysis (nMDS, ANOMSIM and SIMPER). Rank abundance models were fitted, and functional diversity were estimated based on an ecospace model, applied to each sampled unit to detect changes in structure and ecological complexity. Across the ETE three distinctive states were identified: the pre-extinction state (Westbury Formation), characterised by an assemblage with high species richness and ecological redundancy, and with low taxonomic variation and functional diversity. The extinction state (Cotham and Langport members) represents a shift of the marine ecosystem, where > 70% marine species disappears decreasing the ecosystems functioning the marine ecosystem around 80%. The recovery state (Lias Group), commencing some ~ 150 ky after the extinction, with ecologically complex assemblages as new taxa colonised, increasing variation in taxonomic distinctness and new contributing ecological traits and functional richness through the Hettangian. The palaeoecological patterns described here are robust enough to discount possible facies effects, but more important, is consistent with other studies reported globally, and demonstrates that the ecological signals detected in this study are real. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The current extinction crisis demands worldwide commitment to conservation across all sectors of society. By transcending the traditional disciplinary boundaries, conservationists can reach new audiences to communicate pro-conservation knowledge, education and awareness messages. There are approximately 2.7 billion video-gamers worldwide, with millions more joining as a result of global lockdowns. In March 2020, Animal Crossing: New Horizons was released by Nintendo, fast becoming the second-best selling video game ever in Japan, and selling over 26.4 million units worldwide. Unlike many popular video games, its unique premise involves players creating an island, growing vegetation, catching wildlife and donating fossils and species to a museum. The game has been praised for its positivity, escapism and measurable benefits to mental well-being. Here, we articulate how different features of the game, including the islands, their biodiversity and inhabitants, encourage players to exhibit pro-conservation behaviours and attitudes (e.g. recycling litter, or planting a diversity of flowers), as well as improving players’ knowledge about the diversity of relatively little known taxa (marine and freshwater fishes and invertebrates). We also highlight where pitfalls exist (e.g. encouraging the collection of threatened species). We principally frame these discussions in the context of Japan's cultural relationship with the natural world, including its history of insect-collecting and its management of green spaces. We conclude by outlining some recommendations about potential improvements to future releases, or for similar games, that could further promote conservation messaging. This perspective sheds light on the avenues through which Animal Crossing: New Horizons encourages pro-conservation knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of its international audience, with potential for these experiences to translate into real-world conservation actions. During a critical time in humanity's history, video gaming could therefore provide a huge opportunity for communicating conservation messages to billions of people worldwide.

abstract={Background: Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is the causative agent of chytridiomycosis, one of the major causes of worldwide amphibian biodiversity loss. Many amphibians exhibit skin-based chemical defences, which may play an important role against invading pathogens, but whether the synthesis of these chemical compounds is enhanced or suppressed in the presence of pathogens is largely unknown. Here we investigated direct and indirect effects of larval exposure to the globally distributed and highly virulent Bd-GPL strain on skin secreted chemical defences and life history traits during early ontogeny of agile frogs (Rana dalmatina) and common toads (Bufo bufo). Results: Exposure to Bd during the larval stage did not result in enhanced synthesis of the antimicrobial peptide Brevinin-1 Da in R. dalmatina tadpoles or in increased production of bufadienolides in B. bufo tadpoles. However, exposure to Bd during the larval stage had a carry-over effect reaching beyond metamorphosis: both R. dalmatina and B. bufo froglets contained smaller quantities of defensive chemicals than their Bd-naïve conspecifics in the control treatment. Prevalence of Bd and infection intensities were very low in both larvae and metamorphs of R. dalmatina, while in B. bufo we observed high Bd prevalence and infection intensities, especially in metamorphs. At the same time, we did not find a significant effect of Bd-exposure on body mass or development rate in larvae or metamorphs in either species. Conclusions: The lack of detrimental effect of Bd-exposure on life history traits, even parallel with high infection intensities in the case of B. bufo individuals, is surprising and suggests high tolerance of local populations of these two species against Bd. However, the lowered quantity of defensive chemicals may compromise antimicrobial and antipredatory defences of froglets, which may ultimately contribute to population declines also in the absence of conspicuous mass-mortality events. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Most countries have many pieces of legislation that govern biodiversity, including a range of criminal, administrative, and civil law provisions that state how wildlife must be legally used, managed, and protected. However, related debates in conservation, such as about enforcement, often overlook the details within national legislation that define which specific acts are illegal, the conditions under which laws apply, and how they are sanctioned. Based on a review of 90 wildlife laws in 8 high-biodiversity countries with different legal systems, we developed a taxonomy that describes all types of wildlife offenses in those countries. The 511 offenses are organized into a hierarchical taxonomy that scholars and practitioners can use to help conduct legal analyses. This is significant amidst competing calls to strengthen, deregulate, and reform wildlife legislation, particularly in response to fears over zoonotic threats and large-scale biodiversity loss. It can be used to provide more nuance legal analyses and facilitate like-for-like comparisons across countries, informing processes to redraft conservation laws, review deregulation efforts, close loopholes, and harmonize legislation across jurisdictions. We applied the taxonomy in a comparison of sanctions in 8 countries for hunting a protected species. We found not only huge ranges in fines (US$0 to $200,000) and imprisonment terms (1.5 years to life imprisonment), but also fundamentally different approaches to designing sanctions for wildlife offenses. The taxonomy also illustrates how future legal taxonomies can be developed for other environmental issues (e.g., invasive species, protected areas). © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Despite unprecedented scientific productivity, Earth is undergoing a sixth mass extinction. The disconnect between scientific output and species conservation may be related to scientists studying the wrong species. Given fishes have a high extinction rate, we assessed the paradox between scientific productivity and science needed for conservation by comparing scientific output created for critically endangered fishes and game fishes. We searched 197,866 articles (1964–2018) in 112 journals for articles on 460 critically endangered fishes, 297 game fishes, and 35 fishes classified as critically endangered and game fish—our analysis included freshwater and marine species. Only 3% of the articles in the final database were on critically endangered fishes; 82% of critically endangered fishes had zero articles. The difference between the number of articles on game fishes and critically endangered fishes increased temporally with more articles on game fishes during the extinction crisis. Countries with 10 or more critically endangered fishes averaged only 17 articles from 1964 to 2018. Countries with the most critically endangered fishes are most in need of science. More scientific knowledge is needed on critically endangered fishes to meet the challenges of conserving fishes during the sixth mass extinction. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Invasive species are among the major driving forces behind biodiversity loss. Gene drive technology may offer a humane, efficient and cost-effective method of control. For safe and effective deployment it is vital that a gene drive is both self-limiting and can overcome evolutionary resistance. We present HD-ClvR in this modelling study, a novel combination of CRISPR-based gene drives that eliminates resistance and localises spread. As a case study, we model HD-ClvR in the grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), which is an invasive pest in the UK and responsible for both biodiversity and economic losses. HD-ClvR combats resistance allele formation by combining a homing gene drive with a cleave-and-rescue gene drive. The inclusion of a self-limiting daisyfield gene drive allows for controllable localisation based on animal supplementation. We use both randomly mating and spatial models to simulate this strategy. Our findings show that HD-ClvR could effectively control a targeted grey squirrel population, with little risk to other populations. HD-ClvR offers an efficient, self-limiting and controllable gene drive for managing invasive pests. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Urbanisation is a major cause of biodiversity loss but careful habitat management and provision of green space within cities can help to mitigate its negative effects. Grasslands occupy large surface areas and have many functions but only a few studies have begun to explore how birds exploit these habitats in urban contexts. We hypothesized that the value of grasslands for nesting and feeding birds is likely to depend both on landscape context, and on local characteristics (grassland size, use and vegetation structure). We surveyed local habitat characteristics, breeding bird presence, abundance and foraging activity in 47 grassland sites, distributed along an urban-rural gradient in two French cities, and varying in the proportions of grassland, built-up land and residential gardens in the neighbouring landscape. Species richness was influenced by local rather than landscape variables; larger sites with scrub within the grassland and taller hedgerow vegetation were more species rich. Total bird abundance, however, depended on landscape context, and increased in suburban grasslands with a higher proportion of gardens in the landscape. Foraging in grass was more frequently observed in shorter, regularly mown, recreational grasslands. These were more common in urban contexts and favoured by species requiring easily accessible and visible invertebrate prey. Less intensively managed wastelands were species rich despite being in urban contexts and favoured by seedeaters and one farmland specialist. A diversity of use and management of grasslands along the urban-rural gradient could allow birds with various requirements to co-exist at landscape scale. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Managed forests are a key component of strategies aimed at tackling the climate and biodiversity crises. Tapping this potential requires a better understanding of the complex, simultaneous effects of forest management on biodiversity, carbon stocks and productivity. Here, we used data of 135 one-hectare plots from southwestern Germany to disentangle the relative influence of gradients of management intensity, carbon stocks and forest productivity on different components of forest biodiversity (birds, bats, insects, plants) and tree-related microhabitats. We tested whether the composition of taxonomic groups varies gradually or abruptly along these gradients. The richness of taxonomic groups was rather insensitive to management intensity, carbon stocks and forest productivity. Despite the low explanatory power of the main predictor variables, forest management had the greatest relative influence on richness of insects and tree-related microhabitats, while carbon stocks influenced richness of bats, birds, vascular plants and pooled taxa. Species composition changed relatively abruptly along the management intensity gradient, while changes along carbon and productivity gradients were more gradual. We conclude that moderate increases in forest management intensity and carbon stocks, within the range of variation observed in our study system, might be compatible with biodiversity and climate mitigation objectives in managed forests. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={The idea that not all fire regimes are created equal is a central theme in fire research and conservation. Fire frequency (i.e., temporal scale) is likely the most studied fire regime attribute as it relates to conservation of fire-adapted ecosystems. Generally, research converges on fire frequency as the primary filter in plant community assembly and structure, which is often critical to conservation goals. Thus, conservation success is commonly linked to fire frequency in fire regimes. The spatial scale of fire may also be vital to conservation outcomes, but this attribute is underrepresented in the primary literature. In our global, contemporary literature search, we found 37 published syntheses concerning the effects of prescribed fire in conservation over the last decade. In those syntheses, only 16% included studies that reported data-based inferences related to the spatial scale of the fire, whereas 73% included discussion of empirical studies on the temporal scale. Only one of the syntheses discussed studies that explicitly tested the effects of spatial extent, and none of those studies were experiments manipulating spatial scale. Further, understanding spatial-scale-dependent patterns may be relevant because two databases of fire-occurrence data from the United States indicated that spatial scale among lightning-ignited and prescribed fires may have been mismatched over the past few decades. Based on a rich ecological literature base that demonstrates pervasive scale-dependent effects in ecology, spatial-scale-dependent relationships among prescribed fire regimes and conservation outcomes are likely. Using examples from the southeastern United States, we explored the potential for scale-dependent ecological effects of fire. In particular, we highlighted the potential for spatial scale to (a) influence wildlife populations by manipulating the dispersion of habitat components, and (b) modulate plant community assembly and structure by affecting seed dispersal mechanics and spatial patterns in herbivory. Because spatial-scale-dependent outcomes are understudied but likely occurring, we encourage researchers to address the ecological effects of spatial scale in prescribed-fire regimes using comparative and manipulative approaches. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Tham Wiman Nakin or “Snake Cave” has so far been recognized as being the only late Middle Pleistocene Homo-bearing fauna, dated to older than 169 ka, in mainland Southeast Asia. Since the last two decades, the highly diversified mammal fauna found from this cave has been widely used as standard references for several studies, though the majority of fossil primates, carnivores, and ungulates have never been described in detail. This paper presents taxonomic descriptions of unpublished fossil specimens from the long-known collection of Tham Wiman Nakin. As a result, the fauna of Tham Wiman Nakin consisted of at least 28 large mammal taxa. Although several previously described specimens are re-assigned to different tooth elements and/or mammal taxa, our taxonomic study confirms the existence of most of the species identified from the previous work and describes three additional taxa for the locality: an Asian badger, a tiger, and a Himalayan goral. The Tham Wiman Nakin fauna is one of the most diverse Pleistocene mammals, including a hominin, in mainland Southeast Asia and documents long-term survivors of living species since the late Middle Pleistocene. Based on several recent dates of fossil sites in mainland Southeast Asia, biochronological data imply a possible faunal age up to the maximum of 300 ka for the Tham Wiman Nakin fauna, but younger than that of Pha Bong where Gigantopithecus was present. Fossil records in the region also suggest a relatively stable fauna through Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, at least from the late Middle to latest Pleistocene. The extinction occurring in the mainland varied across taxa and likely resulted in less impacted biodiversity loss prior to the Holocene, compared to other continents, as indicated by the small proportion of species becoming extinct during each interval. The importance of stable mosaic habitats through time may provide clues to the long-term survival of several large mammal taxa in the region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA},

abstract={Hunting is a primary driver of biodiversity loss across South-east Asia. Within Cambodia, the use of wire snares to capture wildlife is a severe threat in protected areas but there have been few studies of the behaviour of hunters from local communities. Here, we combine the unmatched count technique with direct questioning to estimate the prevalence of hunting behaviours and wildlife consumption amongst 705 households living within Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, Cambodia. We assessed respondents' knowledge of rules, and their perceptions of patrols responsible for enforcing rules. Estimates of hunting behaviour were variable: results from the unmatched count technique were inconclusive, and direct questioning revealed 9% of households hunted, and 20% set snares around farms to prevent wildlife eating crops. Hunting with domestic dogs was the method most commonly used to catch wildlife (87% of households owned dogs). Wild meat was consumed by 84% of households, and was most frequently bought or caught, but also gifted. We detected a high awareness of conservation rules, but low awareness of punishments and penalties, with wildlife depletion, rather than the risk of being caught by patrols, causing the greatest reduction in hunting. Our findings demonstrate the challenges associated with reliably estimating rule-breaking behaviour and highlight the need to incorporate careful triangulation into study design. © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={The Atlantic Forest biodiversity is considered of extreme biological importance; however, its fauna and flora richness has been threatened by deforestation. This study aimed to present a model for assessing biodiversity loss, considering the municipality of Viçosa do Ceará (northeastern Brazil) as the study area. The used method is based on the proposal of an indicator, from which, we sought to calculate the estimate of biodiversity loss through the decrease in the richness of birds, mammals, and scaly reptiles in the studied habitat, using the species-area relationship model as a reference. The following results were obtained: (1) the biodiversity loss in the study area is at an “extreme” level; (2) the rates of average variation and speed have accelerated movement, therefore, the greater the increase of deforested area, the faster the speed and acceleration of biodiversity loss; (3) the curvature of the function indicated that the critical point of biodiversity loss is reached when deforestation reaches 93% of the ecosystem area. It was concluded that the model used to estimate the loss of birds, mammals, and scaly reptiles was efficient to assess biodiversity loss in the Atlantic Forest ecosystem. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

abstract={Quarrying activities cause profound modifications on ecosystems, such as removal of vegetation cover, biodiversity loss and depletion of ecosystem services. Ecological restoration stands as a solution to revert such effects. Concomitantly, awareness is currently being given on ecosystem services and ecological processes to evaluate restoration efficiency. The objective of the study was to assess restoration success in a quarry subjected to restoration practices for the last 40 years involving the plantation of native Mediterranean vegetation and the non-native Aleppo pine Pinus halepensis. The study was carried out by assessing the effectiveness of seed dispersal service provided by birds in the restored quarry by comparing this service to neighbouring natural (shrubland) and other semi-natural areas (oak-pine mixed open and Aleppo pine forest) present at the landscape. For this purpose, we explored bird composition structure and seed dispersal networks using point counts and faecal samples of mist-netted birds. We also collected vegetation structure data and explored its effect on bird community composition. Our results showed that bird abundance in the restored quarry was significantly lower, and its bird community was compositionally different than natural shrubland and semi-natural areas. For instance, seed-dispersing birds, woody and shrub/ground foragers and partially migrators were the most affected groups at the restored area. Bird community composition and their traits were likely driven by vegetation characteristics, with higher native vegetation cover and fruit richness promoting higher bird abundance and Aleppo pine cover negatively influencing seed-dispersing birds. Concurrently, seed dispersal network in the restored quarry was less complex than in other areas. Seed dispersal services in the restored quarry were below the reported values for neighbouring natural and semi-natural areas and are likely driven by the low abundance of seed-dispersing birds. We consider that the causes affecting this group's low abundance can be related to revegetation measures favouring Aleppo pine, combined with a shallow soil depth and poor soil quality, which may have constrained native vegetation development. We conclude that seed dispersal services at the quarry are depleted, which may suggest a low restoration success concerning ecosystem functioning. Our results strengthen that quarry revegetation with non-native species must be avoided, since it alters bird community composition, and consequently, affects seed dispersal service provided by birds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Terrestrial carnivores are among the most imperiled species worldwide, yet some species are resilient and are recovering in human-dominated landscapes after decades or centuries of absence. Bobcat (Lynx rufus) populations were extirpated from much of Midwestern US in the mid-1800’s, and are currently expanding and recolonizing their former range. In this study, we investigated multi-scale habitat selection for Ohio’s expanding bobcat population, and examined habitat connectivity in order to evaluate the conduits for dispersal statewide. We used citizen observations collected between 1978 and 2019 and logistic regression to evaluate population-level habitat selection, and GPS telemetry data for 20 individuals collected between 2012 and 2014 and a distribution-weighted exponential Resource Selection Function to evaluate individual-level habitat selection within home ranges. At the population level, bobcats selected for higher amounts of forest and pasture (at a 50 km2 scale) and herbaceous vegetation (at 15–50 50 km2 scales), thus overall heterogeneous forested habitat. At individual (home range) level, bobcats selected for forested habitats with low road density and farther away from high traffic roads; they also showed weak selection for open habitat at the home range level. Male home ranges were significantly greater than female home ranges. Lastly, we used the population-level spatial outputs (i.e. habitat suitability map) to parameterize habitat connectivity models using circuit theory in the program Circuitscape. We tested three relationships between habitat suitability and resistance to movement and used a subset of data on potential dispersing individuals to evaluate which relationship performed best. All three relationships performed almost equally well, and we calculated a weighted averaged connectivity map as our final map. Habitat was highly permeable to movements between core areas of two genetically distinct subpopulations located in southeastern Ohio. We also identified potential dispersal corridors from the core areas to other regions of Ohio dominated by agriculture and suburban development via forested riparian corridors. Overall, our analysis offers new information on habitat selection and connectivity in a rebounding felid population and offers important ecological information for wildlife management strategies. We recommend that the suitability and connectivity models should be periodically updated until the population reaches an equilibrium, and be integrated with data from neighboring states for a comprehensive assessment of a conservation success story. ©2021 Popescu et al.},

abstract={The scale and drivers of marine biodiversity loss are being revealed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessment process. We present the first global reassessment of 1,199 species in Class Chondrichthyes—sharks, rays, and chimeras. The first global assessment (in 2014) concluded that one-quarter (24%) of species were threatened. Now, 391 (32.6%) species are threatened with extinction. When this percentage of threat is applied to Data Deficient species, more than one-third (37.5%) of chondrichthyans are estimated to be threatened, with much of this change resulting from new information. Three species are Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct), representing possibly the first global marine fish extinctions due to overfishing. Consequently, the chondrichthyan extinction rate is potentially 25 extinctions per million species years, comparable to that of terrestrial vertebrates. Overfishing is the universal threat affecting all 391 threatened species and is the sole threat for 67.3% of species and interacts with three other threats for the remaining third: loss and degradation of habitat (31.2% of threatened species), climate change (10.2%), and pollution (6.9%). Species are disproportionately threatened in tropical and subtropical coastal waters. Science-based limits on fishing, effective marine protected areas, and approaches that reduce or eliminate fishing mortality are urgently needed to minimize mortality of threatened species and ensure sustainable catch and trade of others. Immediate action is essential to prevent further extinctions and protect the potential for food security and ecosystem functions provided by this iconic lineage of predators. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Increases in area-based conservation are essential to halt biodiversity loss and respond to climate change. Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity are poised to adopt a target of protecting at least 30 per cent of the Earth’s lands, seas and freshwater by 2030. This is in the draft Global Biodiversity Framework and supported by over 70 countries who have joined the High Ambition Coalition. The IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas, in partnership with UNEP – World Conservation Monitoring Centre, National Geographic, the Wildlife Conservation Society and Birdlife International has published guidance entitled ‘Conserving at least 30% of the planet by 2030: What should count?’. This guidance calls for a focus on quality as an essential part of large area-based conservation targets. Quality includes many elements, including a focus on establishing protected and conserved areas in areas important for biodiversity, how they are designed and ecologically connected, and ensuring management effectiveness and governance equity. But protected and conserved areas must be realised in full partnership with Indigenous and local communities. The 30 per cent minimum target provides a significant opportunity to strengthen security of tenure, land and use rights especially for Indigenous Peoples and support to IPLC-led conservation efforts. Moving to protect at least 30 per cent of the Earth by 2030 is a grand challenge in which we need to speak a common language. © 2021, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are key contributors to the current global biodiversity crisis. Psittaciformes (parrots) are one of the most vulnerable avian taxa and psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD) is the most common viral disease in wild parrots. PBFD is caused by the beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), which belongs to the Circoviridae family and comprises a circular, single-stranded DNA genome. BFDV is considered to have spread rapidly across the world and, in 2005, an outbreak of PBFD was documented in the recovering population of the Mauritius parakeet (Alexandrinus eques). The Mauritius parakeet was once the world’s rarest parrot and has been suc-cessfully recovered through 30 years of intensive conservation management. Molecular surveillance for the prevalence of BFDV was carried out across a 24-year sample archive spanning the period from 1993 to 2017, and DNA sequencing of positive individuals provided an opportunity to assess patterns of phylogenetic and haplotype diversity. Phylogenetic analyses show variation in the extent of viral diversification within the replicase protein (Rep). Timeseries of BFDV prevalence and number of haplotypes reveal that two subsequent waves of infection occurred in 2010/2011 and 2013/2014 following the initial outbreak in 2005. Continued disease surveillance to determine the frequency and intensity of subsequent waves of infection may benefit future translocation/reintroduction planning. The continued growth of the Mauritius parakeet population despite the presence of BFDV bodes well for its long-term persistence. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The UN declaration of the Decade of Ecosystem Restoration 2021–2030 emphasizes the need for effective measures to restore ecosystems and safeguard biodiversity. Large herbivores regulate many ecosystem processes and functions; yet, their potential as a nature-based solution to buffer against long-term temporal declines in biodiversity associated with global change and restore diversity in secondary forests remains unknown. By means of an exclusion experiment, we tested experimentally the buffering effects of large wild herbivores to avert against long-term biodiversity collapse in old-growth and secondary tropical forests in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil where sapling abundance and species richness declined c. 20% over the course of 10 years. The experiment comprised 50 large herbivore exclosure-open control plot pairs (25 at the old-growth forest and 25 at the secondary forest), where 2 m2 were monitored in every plot during a 10-year period. Large herbivores were able to decelerate diversity declines and compositional change in the species-rich old-growth forest, but only decelerated compositional change in the secondary forest. In contrast, declines in species richness and abundance were unaffected by large herbivores on either forest. The buffering effects of large herbivores were strongly nonlinear and contingent on the initial level of diversity at the patch scale: highly diverse communities suffered the strongest collapse in the absence of large herbivores. Thus, larger buffering effects of large herbivores on the old-growth forest are the logical consequence of large herbivores buffering the many high diversity plant communities found in this forest. Conversely, as the secondary forest held fewer high diversity patches, buffering effects on the secondary forest were weak. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that large herbivores have moderate yet critical effects on slowing down community change and diversity loss of highly diverse plant communities, thus suggesting that the conservation of (and potentially trophic rewilding with) large herbivores is a fundamental nature-based solution for averting the global collapse of the strongholds of biodiversity. Its buffering effects on biodiversity loss operate at very small spatial scales, are likely contingent on successional stage and are most effective in old-growth or high diversity secondary forests. © 2021 IPE - Instituto de Pesquisas Ecologicas.

abstract={Grassland birds are among the most globally threatened bird groups due to substantial degradation of native grassland habitats. However, the current network of grassland conservation areas may not be adequate for halting population declines and biodiversity loss. Here, we evaluate a network of grassland conservation areas within Wisconsin, U.S.A., that includes both large Focal Landscapes and smaller targeted conservation areas (e.g., Grassland Bird Conservation Areas, GBCAs) established within them. To date, this conservation network has lacked baseline information to assess whether the current placement of these conservation areas aligns with population hot spots of grassland-dependent taxa. To do so, we fitted data from thousands of avian point-count surveys collected by citizen scientists as part of Wisconsin's Breeding Bird Atlas II with multinomial N-mixture models to estimate habitat–abundance relationships, develop spatially explicit predictions of abundance, and establish ecological baselines within priority conservation areas for a suite of obligate grassland songbirds. Next, we developed spatial randomization tests to evaluate the placement of this conservation network relative to randomly placed conservation networks. Overall, less than 20% of species statewide populations were found within the current grassland conservation network. Spatial tests demonstrated a high representation of this bird assemblage within the entire conservation network, but with a bias toward birds associated with moderately tallgrasses relative to those associated with shortgrasses or tallgrasses. We also found that GBCAs had higher representation at Focal Landscape rather than statewide scales. Here, we demonstrated how combining citizen science data with hierarchical modeling is a powerful tool for estimating ecological baselines and conducting large-scale evaluations of an existing conservation network for multiple grassland birds. Our flexible spatial randomization approach offers the potential to be applied to other protected area networks and serves as a complementary tool for conservation planning efforts globally. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={European Union (EU) policy encourages the development of a blue economy (BE) by un-locking the full economic potential of oceans, seas, lakes, rivers and other water resources, especially in member countries in which it represents a low contribution to the national economy (under 1%). However, climate change represents a main barrier to fully realizing a BE. Enabling conditions that will support the sustainable development of a BE and increase its climate resiliency must be promoted. Romania has high potential to contribute to the development of the EU BE due to its geo-graphic characteristics, namely the presence of the Danube Delta–Black Sea macrosystem, which is part of the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion (RLDE). Aquatic living resources represent a sector which can significantly contribute to the growth of the BE in the RLDE, a situation which imposes restrictions for both halting biodiversity loss and maintaining the proper conditions to maximize the benefits of the existing macrosystem. It is known that climate change causes water quality problems, accentuates water level fluctuations and loss of biodiversity and induces the destruction of habitats, which eventually leads to fish stock depletion. This paper aims to develop an analytical framework based on multiple linear predictive and forecast models that offers cost‐efficient tools for the monitoring and control of water quality, fish stock dynamics and biodiversity in order to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of the BE of the RLDE in the context of climate change. The following water‐dependent variables were considered: total nitrogen (TN); total phosphorus (TP); dissolved oxygen (DO); pH; water temperature (wt); and water level, all of which were measured based on a series of 26 physicochemical indicators associated with 4 sampling areas within the RLDE (Brăila, Galați, Tulcea and Sulina counties). Predictive models based on fish species catches associated with the Galati County Danube River Basin segment and the ʺDanube Delta” Biosphere Reserve Administration territory were included in the analytical framework to establish an efficient tool for monitoring fish stock dynamics and structures as well as identify methods of controlling fish biodiversity in the RLDE to enhance the sustainable development and resilience of the already‐existing BE and its expansion (blue growth) in the context of aquatic environment climate variation. The study area reflects the integrated approach of the emerging BE, focused on the ocean, seas, lakes and rivers according to the United Nations Agenda. The results emphasized the vulnerability of the RLDE to climate change, a situation revealed by the water level, air temperature and water quality parameter trend lines and forecast models. Considering the sampling design applied within the RLDE, it can be stated that the Tulcea county Danube sector was less affected by climate change compared with the Galați county sector as confirmed by water TN and TP forecast analysis, which revealed higher increasing trends in Galați compared with Tulcea. The fish stock biodiversity was proven to be affected by global warming within the RLDE, since peaceful species had a higher upward trend compared with predatory species. Water level and air temperature forecasting analysis proved to be an important tool for climate change monitoring in the study area. The resulting analytical framework confirmed that time series methods could be used together with machine learning prediction methods to highlight their synergetic abilities for monitoring and predicting the impact of climate change on the marine living resources of the BE sector within the RLDE. The forecasting models developed in the present study were meant to be used as methods of revealing future information, making it possible for decision makers to adopt proper management solutions to prevent or limit the negative impacts of climate change on the BE. Through the identified independent variables, prediction models offer a solution for managing the dependent variables and the possibility of performing less cost‐demanding aquatic environment monitoring activities. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Climate change and biodiversity loss have become increasingly prominent in recent years. To evaluate these two issues, prediction models have been developed on the basis of ecological-niche (or climate‐envelope) models. However, the spatial scale and extent of the underlying environmental data are known to affect results. To verify whether the difference in the modelled spatial extent will affect model results, this study uses the MaxEnt model to predict the suitability range of giant pandas in the Min Mountain System (MMS) area through modelling performed (1) at a nationwide scale and (2) at a restricted MMS extent. The results show that, firstly, both models performed well in terms of accuracy. Secondly, extending the modelling extent does help improve the modelling results when the distribution data is incomplete. Thirdly, when environmental information is insufficient, the qualitative analysis should be combined with quantitative analysis to ensure the accuracy and practicality of the research. Finally, when predicting a suitability distribution of giant pandas, the modelling results under different spatial extents can provide management agencies at the various administrative levels with more targeted giant panda protective measures. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Mammals are important components of biodiversity that have been drastically and rapidly impacted by climate change, habitat loss, and anthropogenic pressure. Understanding key species distribution to optimize conservation targets is both urgent and necessary to reverse the current biodiversity crisis. Herein, we applied habitat suitability models for a key Neotropical forest ungulate, the white-lipped peccary (WLP Tayassu pecari), to investigate the effects of climate and landscape modifications on its distribution, which has been drastically reduced in Brazil. We used 318 primary records of WLP to derive habitat suitability maps across Brazil. Our models included bioclimatic, topographic, landscape, and human influence predictors in two modelling approaches. Models including all categories of predictors obtained the highest predictive ability and showed prevalence of suitable areas in forested regions of the country, covering 49% of the Brazilian territory. Filtering out small forest fragments (<2050 ha) reduced the suitable area by 5%, with a further reduction of 4% that was caused by deforestation until 2020, therefore until 2020, the species has suffered a reduction of ~60% from its historical range in Brazil. Of the 40% of the Brazilian territory suitable to WLP, only 12% is protected. In the Atlantic Forest, only half of all protected areas have suitable habitat for WLP and even less in Pantanal (44%), Cerrado (14%) and Caatinga (7%). In a second modelling approach, mapping the areas with suitable climate and those with suitable landscapes separately, allowed us to identify four categories of conservation values, and showed that only 17% of the Brazilian territory has both high landscape and climatic suitability for WLP. Our models can help inform complementary conservation management strategies and actions that could be essential in slowing down and possibly reversing current trends of population and geographic range reductions for the species, thereby averting a possible future collapse of forest ecosystem functioning in the Neotropical region. © 2021 The Authors},

Here we provide a detailed account of the Chinese Milu (Elaphurus davidianus) conservation and reintroduction efforts over the past 35 years, and give updated information on current Milu distribution, population dynamics and conservation status based on long-term monitoring (1985–2020) and a detailed follow-up investigation (2013–2020) in 235 wildlife institutions throughout China. Milu conservation in China comprised three phases: i) establishing ex situ populations and increasing the number of Milu through captive breeding (1985–1992); ii) preparing captive Milu for life in the wild and establishing in situ conservation populations (1993–1997); and iii) reintroduction of Milu into the wild throughout their historic range (1998–ongoing). Currently, there are ca. 9062 Milu (including 2825 wild individuals) distributed across 83 sites with 7380 individuals living at Beijing Milu Park, Jiangsu Dafeng Milu Nature Reserve and Hubei Shishou Milu Nature Reserve. The average birth rates in three sites were all over 0.200, and the average adult mortality rates were below 0.085, resulting in a rapid population growth. We discuss a variety of factors that contributed to ex situ conservation success in the reintroduction of a species formerly extinct in the wild, and highlight past and present challenges of Milu conservation in China. Our results will provide helpful information on conservation and reintroduction for other endangered species around the world. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Recent pandemics have highlighted the urgency to connect disciplines studying animal, human, and environment health, that is, the “One Health” concept. The One Health approach takes a holistic view of health, but it has largely focused on zoonotic diseases while not addressing oncogenic processes. We argue that cancers should be an additional key focus in the One Health approach based on three factors that add to the well-documented impact of humans on the natural environment and its implications on cancer emergence. First, human activities are oncogenic to other animals, exacerbating the dynamics of oncogenesis, causing immunosuppressive disorders in wildlife with effects on host–pathogen interactions, and eventually facilitating pathogen spillovers. Second, the emergence of transmissible cancers in animal species (including humans) has the potential to accelerate biodiversity loss across ecosystems and to become pandemic. It is crucial to understand why, how, and when transmissible cancers emerge and spread. Third, translating knowledge of tumor suppressor mechanisms found across the Animal Kingdom to human health offers novel insights into cancer prevention and treatment strategies. © 2021 The Authors.

funding_text 1={Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study. The “One World–One Health” concept, initiated in 2004, recognizes the close connections between health of humans and that of other animals and our shared environment. The importance of this concept is evidenced by the accelerated emergence or re-emergence of zoonoses (e.g., Ebola, current COVID-19 pandemic) over the last decades (Peyre et al., 2021). Although the One Health approach proposes a holistic view of health, it has, and still remains, largely focused on zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. Reasons behind this bias are multiple, ranging from the fact that historically it has originated from a collaboration between human and veterinary medicines, and also because zoonotic diseases undoubtedly represent major health and economic threats to human societies. The scope has broadened with the inclusion of other fields, such as antimicrobial resistance (WHO, 2015), (eco)toxicology, and health in urban environments (Destoumieux-Garzón et al., 2018), but not cancer. The impact of human activities on the natural environment and their implications on cancer emergence in humans have been largely documented (e.g., anthropogenic pollution, occupation, food, and lifestyle; Aktipis & Nesse, 2013) (Briffa et al., 2020; Erren et al., 2015; Turner et al., 2020). These effects and their consequences could increase in the context of climate change (Hiatt & Beyeler, 2020). Beyond this acknowledged link between the environment and cancer, we discuss here three reasons for a broader inclusion of cancer into the One Health concept. First, the interplay/interactions between cancer and infectious diseases make arduous to separate these communicable and non-communicable diseases, and their combination could pose higher risk for human and animal health. For instance, cancers can cause immunosuppression 2020); cancers can also be induced by pathogens (Ewald & Swain Ewald, 2015; Jacqueline et al., 2017). However, little attention has been paid to the role of human-induced cancers in infectious diseases’ emergence and spread. Human activities elevate cancer incidences for wildlife species (via chemical pollution, changes in diet, and reductions in genetic diversity; Baines et al., 2021; Giraudeau et al., 2018; Sepp et al., 2019; Ujvari et al., 2018). As in humans, cancer burdens generate a range of immunosuppressive disorders in livestock, and likely in wildlife (Pollock & Roth, 1989; Vittecoq et al., 2013). Animals with cancer, human or otherwise, may be more susceptible, contagious, and debilitated by infectious diseases. Therefore, the evolutionary mismatch between enhanced human-induced cancer risks and maladapted cancer defense levels in animals will indirectly amplify pathogen dynamics in wildlife, in both natural and human-dominated ecosystems. In undisturbed natural environments, a fraction of pathogens is generally maintained by the presence of immunocompromised individuals, a stable equilibrium, that has been reached over evolutionary time (Hassell et al., 2021). By accelerating cancer incidence and the dynamics of oncogenesis, anthropogenic activities can disrupt these equilibria. These altered dynamics are complex and not merely correlated with pollution levels, but also driven by, for example, the different susceptibilities of exposed species to carcinogenesis. For instance, a benthic lifestyle within fish communities contributes to elevated cancer incidence through chronic exposure to contaminated sediment and/or consumption of contaminated invertebrates (Black & Baumann, 1991; Martineau et al., 2002). The consequences of these disturbances are difficult to predict given the cascade of indirect effects that may subsequently occur. For example, the impact of higher cancer incidences and carcinogens will depend on the species most affected by cancer (e.g., predators or prey species) and the resulting immunosuppressive disorders (see, for instance, Perret et al., 2020). The relationship between an animal's immunosuppression and cancer burden (e.g., linear, exponential, negative binomial, and with or without critical thresholds) may also vary with species and/or with the organ in which malignancies develop. Clearly, the roles of pollution-induced oncogenesis and immunosuppression in boosting pathogen communities in wildlife and their spread to humans are poorly understood at the moment. Given that parasitism and disease spread may also be limited in ecological communities via mechanisms such as the dilution effect (Civitello et al., 2015), pollution-induced oncogenesis could amplify these transfers if it concomitantly promotes a decline in biodiversity. A second reason for elevating the importance of cancers in the One Health approach concerns cancers that can themselves become transmissible. There are currently nine known transmissible cancer lineages (one in dogs, two in Tasmanian devil populations, and six in marine bivalves; Dujon, Bramwell, et al., 2020; Dujon, Gatenby, et al., 2020), some of which threaten the survival of animal populations (and species) and are detrimental to ecosystem stability (see, for instance, Hamede et al., 2020). Indubitably, this number is a gross underestimate due to poor monitoring of cancer in wildlife (Dujon, Bramwell, et al., 2020; Dujon, Gatenby, et al., 2020; Dujon, Ujvari, et al., 2020; Ujvari et al., 2016). The conditions for the emergence of transmissible cancers, while poorly understood, require a perfect storm of sequential steps that is reminiscent of a parasitic lifestyle. First, the tumor must shed a large number of cells that are able to survive outside of or on the surface of the original host. Those cells, when in contact with a new host, must then evade immune recognition (particularly challenging in vertebrates) and successfully proliferate in the correct tissue of the new host (Ujvari et al., 2017). Environmental stress, lack of genetic diversity within the host population, and other infectious diseases may weaken the host's immune system enabling transmission and establishment of cancer cells from one individual to another (Dujon, Bramwell, et al., 2020; Dujon, Gatenby, et al., 2020; Dujon, Ujvari, et al., 2020). Human activities may also disperse certain transmissible cancers across the globe, giving previously isolated outbreaks pandemic potentials. Already, a single transmissible cancer lineage has been observed in multiple marine mussel species across multiple oceans, suggesting dispersal by aquaculture and/or shipping (Bramwell et al., 2021; Skazina et al., 2021; Yonemitsu et al., 2019). A full understanding of the ecological impacts of transmissible cancers on ecosystems and biodiversity will require integrating tools from landscape ecology, conservation biology, and epidemiology to identify wildlife species at risk of contagious malignant cell lines, detect their emergence, anticipate their spread, and evaluate consequences to natural and human-dominated ecosystems (Bramwell et al., 2021; Dujon et al., 2020; Dujon, Gatenby, et al., 2020; Dujon, Ujvari, et al., 2020). A worst-case scenario might involve the emergence of a communicable cancer in humans or in livestock, yielding environmental and human/animal health crises similar to classical epidemics and epizootics. Finally, a third reason to consider cancer in the One Health approach lies in the scientific insights provided by comparative oncology focusing on the diverse tumor suppression mechanisms that have evolved across the animal kingdom (Nunney et al., 2015; Schiffman & Breen, 2015). Cancers appeared during the transition from unicellular to metazoan life, approximately one billion years ago (Domazet-Lošo & Tautz, 2010). Cancers occur in all branches of multicellular life, and they have evolved diverse adaptations to prevent cancer initiation, suppress malignant progression, and alleviate negative fitness consequences of tumor burdens (Aktipis et al., 2015). For instance, one might expect large/long-lived animals to have more cancers than smaller/shorter-lived ones, given that the former have many more cell divisions that potential give rise to cancer-initiating mutations, but such a relationship across species is not observed, due to the various mechanisms of cancer resistance that have evolved in large and long-lived species (i.e., Peto's Paradox, Tollis et al., 2017). Even in smaller species, under particular ecological conditions, selection can favor high levels of cancer resistance, as observed in naked-mole rats and bats (Lambert & Portfors, 2017; Seluanov et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2013). Scientists are increasingly focusing on the ways natural selection has protected animal species from cancer (Boutry et al., 2020). This work is deciphering the underlying tissue, cellular, and genomic mechanisms in cancer-resistant/tolerant species (Abegglen et al., 2015; Keane et al., 2015; Sulak et al., 2016). Another particularly interesting direction of comparative oncology investigates the local evolution of adaptations in species or populations that have been living in environments with excesses of naturally occurring carcinogens (Hourdez et al., 2021; Vittecoq et al., 2018). To what extent do these populations show adaptations to prevent the emergence of cancer versus adaptations to mitigate the negative effects of cancer burdens? To what extent do these populations’ anti-cancer adaptations increase or decrease susceptibility to infectious diseases? Of particular interest would be adaptations that simultaneously reduce cancer and infections. Studying species and ecological communities chronically exposed to carcinogens, with a particular focus on host–pathogen dynamics, could shed light on the possible impacts and repercussions of human-induced cancers within wildlife species (Vittecoq et al., 2018). From a medical perspective, the adaptations of long-lived mammals and other species for preventing and suppressing cancer should inspire nature-based solutions to cancer, such as novel cancer treatment strategies, by mimicking the processes allowing these organisms to prevent or limit malignant progression despite high levels of mutagenic substances. Thus, comparative oncology offers key insights into cancer epidemiology, prevention, and novel therapies for humans. In conclusion, humans, domestic animals, and wildlife species are on the front lines of environmental changes and exposure to toxic hazards from anthropogenic activities. While it is well recognized that these processes directly affect immunity and hence pathogen dynamics (e.g., Dittmar et al., 2014; Tracy et al., 2020), much less is known concerning the indirect links resulting from interactions involving non-communicable diseases, such as cancer. The direct and indirect effects do not necessarily yield the same outcomes. Cancer-causing or cancer-associated processes are undoubtedly an underappreciated health consequence of modern anthropogenic changes, and they cannot be considered in isolation from other biological players in ecosystems, especially pathogens. Ecological impacts, sooner or later, are usually followed by evolutionary responses, leading to novel equilibria in ecosystems. However, we currently ignore how the novel equilibria will be achieved and shaped in an increasingly stressful world. A particular question remaining to be answered is how pollution and consequent oncogenic processes will impact infectious diseases and thus human health particularly before reaching a novel equilibrium. Exploring the interplay between human activities, novel cancer risks experienced by wildlife species, cancer defense evolution, biotic interactions, and infectious disease dynamics, notably those transmissible to humans, should become a stronger topic within the One Health perspective (Figure 1). Because one single method or model cannot thoroughly describe these complex dynamics, more than ever researchers must engage in greater exchanges and collaborations involving different disciplines, such as field and experimental ecology, epidemiology, eco-toxicology, immunology, evolutionary biology, oncology, and pharmacy.},

abstract={Reversing biodiversity loss is a global imperative that requires setting aside sufficient space for species. In South Africa, an estimated area of 20 million ha is under wildlife ranching, a form of private land enterprise that adopts wildlife-based land uses for commercial gain. This land has potential to contribute towards biodiversity conservation, but the extent to which this occurs has not been evaluated. Using structured questionnaires of 226 wildlife ranchers, we assessed how the sector contributes towards the conservation of ungulates and elephants (hereafter herbivores). Overall, 40 herbivore species were present across the sample, where individual ranches had a mean of 15.0 (± 4.8) species, 1.9 (± 1.5) threatened species, and 3.6 (± 3.1) extralimital species per property. In comparison to 54 state PAs, wildlife ranches had significantly higher species richness, more threatened species but more extralimital species when property/reserve size was controlled for. Ranches conducting trophy hunting had similar species richness and numbers of extralimital species per ha, but fewer threatened species when compared to ranches conducting ecotourism. We estimate that 4.66–7.25 million herbivores occur on ranches nationally, representing one of the few examples on earth where indigenous mammal populations are thriving and demonstrating how sustainable use can lead to rewilding. We discuss the potential negative impacts of widespread game fencing on landscape fragmentation and gene flow, as well as how the widespread occurrence of extralimital species may lead to hybridisation, biotic homogenisation, and changes to vegetation dynamics. Despite these challenges, commercial wildlife ranching offers a viable option for conserving large mammalian herbivore biodiversity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={China has become one of the world’s largest lenders in overseas development finance. Development projects, such as roads, railways and power plants, often drive biodiversity loss and infringe on Indigenous lands, yet the risks implicit in China’s overseas development finance are poorly understood. Here we examine the extent to which projects financed by China’s policy banks between 2008 and 2019 occur within and adjacent to areas where large-scale investment can present considerable risks to biodiversity and Indigenous peoples. Further, we compare these risks with those posed by similar projects financed by the World Bank, previously the world’s largest source of development finance. We found that 63% of China-financed projects overlap with critical habitats, protected areas or Indigenous lands, with up to 24% of the world’s threatened birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians potentially impacted by the projects. Hotspots of the risks are primarily distributed in northern sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and parts of South America. Overall, China’s development projects pose greater risks than those of the World Bank, particularly within the energy sector.

abstract={There is an increasing recognition that, although the climate change and biodiversity crises are fundamentally connected, they have been primarily addressed independently and a more integrated global approach is essential to tackle these two global challenges. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are hailed as a pathway for promoting synergies between the climate change and biodiversity agendas. There are, however, uncertainties and difficulties associated with the implementation of NbS, while the evidence regarding their benefits for biodiversity remains limited. We identify five key research areas where incomplete or poor information hinders the development of integrated biodiversity and climate solutions. These relate to refining our understanding of how climate change mitigation and adaptation approaches benefit biodiversity conservation; enhancing our ability to track and predict ecosystems on the move and/or facing collapse; improving our capacity to predict the impacts of climate change on the effectiveness of NbS; developing solutions that match the temporal, spatial and functional scale of the challenges; and developing a comprehensive and practical framework for assessing, and mitigating against, the risks posed by the implementation of NbS. Policy implications. The Conference of the Parties (COP) for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) present a clear policy window for developing coherent policy frameworks that align targets across the nexus of biodiversity and climate change. This window should (a) address the substantial and chronic underfunding of global biodiversity conservation, (b) remove financial incentives that negatively impact biodiversity and/or climate change, (c) develop higher levels of integration between the biodiversity and climate change agendas, (d) agree on a monitoring framework that enables the standardised quantification and comparison of biodiversity gains associated with NbS across ecosystems and over time and (e) rethink environmental legislation to better support biodiversity conservation in times of rapid climatic change. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Trade of non-native reptiles is an important and increasing driver of biodiversity loss and often compromises the standards required for protection. However, the growing interest in non-native reptiles as pets has posed serious concerns to wildlife managers and conservationists. Instituting effective policies regarding non-native reptiles requires a thorough understanding of the potential range of species in new environments. In this study, we used an ensemble of ten species distribution models to predict the potential distribution for 23 of the most commonly traded species of reptiles across the Middle East. We used ten modeling techniques implemented in the Biomod2 package and ensemble forecasts. Final models used thirty environmental variables, including climatic, topographic, and land cover/land use variables. Our results indicate that all Middle Eastern countries included suitable habitats for at least six species, except Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain, for which the models did not predict any suitable habitats. Our study showed that Lebanon, Palestine, Turkey, and Israel face the highest risk of biological invasion based on the area of suitable habitats for all studied species. Also, the results showed that turtles posed the highest risk of spreading in the Middle East. Information on which species pose a greater danger as invaders and the possible impacts of their introduction will be a valuable contribution to the development of conservation plans and policies. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={The End Permian Mass Extinction (EPME, ca. 252 Ma) is considered as the most severe biodiversity crisis in the Phanerozoic, affecting more than 90% of marine species and 75% of terrestrial species. In recent years, ichnological analysis has emerged as a proxy to better understand the paleoenvironmental changes associated with this event, as well as their effect(s) on the biota and its recovery. This study focuses on the ichnological analysis of an extended upper Permian – Lower Triassic succession from the DD-1 core, drilled in Deltadalen, Central Spitsbergen. Variations in degree of bioturbation and ichnodiversity across the Permian-Triassic transition allow for the characterization of pre-, syn-, and post-EPME phases. Pre-EPME is characterized by a high degree of bioturbation (BI = 5), and a diverse trace fossil assemblage (13 ichnotaxa) with abundant Nereites, frequent Planolites and Phycosiphon, and the more or less local record of Asterosoma, Bergaueria, Chondrites, Macaronichnus, Palaeophycus, Taenidium, Teichichnus, Thalassinoides, Zoophycos, meniscate horizontal burrows and undifferentiated vertical traces, indicative of oxygenated bottom and pore-waters, as well as high nutrient availability in the benthic habitat. The EPME was followed by an interval characterized by the scarcity (BI = 1) or even absence (BI = 0) of trace fossils. The decrease in ichnodiversity was abrupt at first and more progressive subsequently, as the conditions were inhospitable (i.e., very low oxygenation) in the benthic habitat. In this context, short-lasting episodes of improved paleoenvironmental conditions (from anoxia to dysoxia) allowed for intermittent colonization of the substrate. The post-EPME interval is characterized by a gradual recovery of the trace maker community in terms of abundance (BI from 1 to 5) and ichnodiversity (total of 10 ichnotaxa), revealing a relatively rapid reestablishment of favourable paleoenvironmental conditions for the benthic habitat, with better‑oxygenated bottom and pore-waters, as well as improved nutrient availability at or just below the seafloor. This new ichnological information highlights (i) the absence of a total extinction of the trace-maker community, despite a marked reduction in abundance and ichnodiversity during the EPME, and (ii) the rapid recovery of the benthic fauna during the Induan Age, ca. 150 kyr after the EPME occurred. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The Anthropocene is characterized by unparalleled human impact on other species, potentially ushering in the sixth mass extinction. Yet mitigation efforts remain hampered by limited information on the spatial patterns and intensity of the threats driving global biodiversity loss. Here we use expert-derived information from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List on threats to 23,271 species, representing all terrestrial amphibians, birds and mammals, to generate global maps of the six major threats to these groups: agriculture, hunting and trapping, logging, pollution, invasive species, and climate change. Our results show that agriculture and logging are pervasive in the tropics and that hunting and trapping is the most geographically widespread threat to mammals and birds. Additionally, current representations of human pressure underestimate the overall pressure on biodiversity, due to the exclusion of threats such as hunting and climate change. Alarmingly, this is particularly the case in areas of the highest biodiversity importance. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={We produced a biodiversity indicator, the Canadian Species Index (CSI), by gathering abundance data for Canadian vertebrate populations and adapting the Living Planet Index methodology. The final indicator incorporates over 3000 abundance time series and contains data for more than 50% of Canadian native vertebrate species. Species abundance declined by an average 10% between 1970 and 2014, with trends varying across taxonomic groups. To facilitate the interpretation of the indicator and contribute to the transparency of the reporting process, here we present a discussion of the indicator's coverage, data quality and data gaps. Using data collected for other purposes means the dataset inherits the biases in biodiversity monitoring. We therefore assessed taxonomic and geographic coverage of the data underlying the indicator to highlight which areas and groups are under-represented. Birds are comprehensively monitored across Canada and are considered good indicators of the state of the environment. Other taxonomic groups are less well monitored, and the data available for these groups often consist of shorter and less full time series, representing smaller segments of the national population. A disaggregation based on data quality appears to show that trends based on species with lower quality data are more negative than for species with higher quality data. We discuss possible sources of the difference, including the relationship between taxon and data quality. Additional data collection on species contributing to the lower-quality subsets is needed to confirm negative trends. © 2021},

abstract={Species delimitation is fundamental to deciphering the mechanisms that generate and maintain biodiversity. Alpha taxonomy historically relied on expert knowledge to describe new species using phenotypic and biogeographic evidence, which has the appearance of investigator subjectivity. In contrast, DNA-based methods using the multispecies coalescent model (MSC) promise a more objective approach to describing biodiversity. However, recent criticisms suggest that under some conditions the MSC may over-split lineages, identifying species that do not reflect biological reality. Here, we reconcile these approaches using empirical data for the Greenthroat Darter complex (Etheostoma lepidum), a small freshwater fish species with a disjunct distribution in Texas and New Mexico, USA. We demonstrate that MSC methods recognizes all nine sampled populations as distinct species, sometimes splitting specimens from a single locality into multiple species. However, environmental, phenotypic, and biogeographic evidence do not corroborate the nine species supported by the MSC. Instead, collective evidence indicates that E. lepidum is comprised of just three species that are consistent with the molecular phylogeny: Etheostoma lepidum (Greenthroat Darter) in rivers draining the eastern Edwards Plateau, Etheostoma cf. lepidum (Texas Darter) in the Concho and San Saba rivers, and Etheostoma cf. lepidum (Pecos Darter) in the Pecos River. The Pecos Darter is likely highly imperiled due to its localized distribution and reliance on vanishing spring-fed stream habitats. The impending biodiversity crisis makes integrative and swift species delimitation more necessary than ever. Our study exemplifies how classic taxonomic expertise combined with molecular phylogenetics can produce a more robust description of threatened biodiversity. © 2021 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences},

abstract={Data from the Integrated Tracking of Aquatic Animals in the Gulf of Mexico (iTAG) network, and sister networks, were used to evaluate fish movements in the Florida Keys—an extensive reef fish ecosystem just north of Cuba connecting the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. We analysed ~2 million detections for 23 species, ranging from reef fish such as Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus, Serranidae) to migratory apex predators such as white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias, Lamnidae). To facilitate comparisons across species, we used an eco-evolutionary movement strategy framework that identified measurable movement traits and their proximate and ultimate drivers. Detectability was species-specific and quantified with a detection potential index. Life stages detected in the study area varied by species and residency varied with life stage. Four annual movement types were identified as follows: high site-fidelity residents, range residents, seasonal migrants and general migrants. The endangered smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata, Pristidae), a seasonal migrant, exhibited the greatest within-ecosystem connectivity. Site attachment, stopover and deep-water migration behaviours differed between individuals, species and annual movement types. All apex predators were migratory. General migrants were significantly larger than fish in the other movement types, a life-history and movement trait combination that is common but not exclusive, as many small pelagics also migrate. Most teleosts exhibited movements associated with spawning. As concerns grow over habitat and biodiversity loss, multispecies movescapes, such as presented here, are expected to play an increasingly important role in informing ecosystem-based and non-extractive fisheries management strategies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Subsurface pipe drainage was a frequently used way of agriculture intensification. Here, we present a case study of peat meadows that were drained from the mid 1980s to 1990s and were restored by interrupting drainage pipes through clay sealed trenches. This trial was subject of extensive survey of plant, soil fauna and soil chemistry, which was done just before restoration and then repeated 20 years later. The water table was the closest to surface in undrained meadows and much deeper in drained and restored meadows during both times. In the restored meadow, some increase of the water table was observed, but the water table was mostly within 60 cm of the surface. Undrained meadow was much richer in soil organic carbon. Plant communities in both drained and restored plots become closer to those in undrained remnants 20 years after restoration. Community weighted mean for Ellenberger values showed that undrained peat meadow remnants were more oligotrophic than drained and restored sites. Soil fauna communities of undrained remnants and both drained treatments were clearly separated in 1990s and lumped together 20 years later. This was caused by a shift in the communities in both drained treatments but also by degradation of undrained remnants, which shifted towards drained sites. The results show that restoration slightly shifted the communities towards the undrained reference sites, but the shift was not much bigger that those in drained sites and in both cases, do not result in peat formation.

abstract={One of the major causes of aquatic biodiversity loss is the contamination of the environment by pesticides. Even though there is a considerable amount of studies on the subject, there are still few that deal with the effects of carbofuran on native species in Brazil. Although carbofuran is widely used in Brazil, its action on native organisms, such as the Atlantic Forest lambari Deuterodon iguape, has not yet been studied. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of exposure to carbofuran on the fish D. iguape, considering the behavior and specific oxygen consumption as end points. Opercular movements, dorsal fin movements, and swimming speed were analyzed as behavioral parameters. To assess specific oxygen consumption, fish were subjected to concentrations of 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/L, for 24 h. For behavior analysis, fish remained exposed to carbofuran at concentrations of 0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg/L, in periods of 0, 2, 24, and 48 h. The behavior was studied through filming, analyzed with the free software, Tracker 4.92 (Open Source Physics). The results demonstrate an increase in opercular movements (18% ± 2.65) and a decrease in dorsal fin movements (− 21.2% ± 2.97), as well as in swimming speed (− 58.3% ± 1.83) of the experimental groups compared to the control group. There was an increase in oxygen consumption of 58.4% in fish exposed to the highest concentration of carbofuran. Thus, it is concluded that carbofuran altered D. iguape’s behavior and oxygen consumption. The species was sensitive to carbofuran concentrations and can be used as a bioindicator. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Biological diversity is the basis for, and an indicator of biosphere integrity. Together with climate change, its loss is one of the two most important planetary boundaries. A halt in biodiversity loss is one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Current changes in biodiversity in the vast landmass of Siberia are at an initial stage of inventory, even though the Siberian environment is experiencing rapid climate change, weather extremes and transformation of land use and management. Biodiversity changes affect traditional land use by Indigenous People and multiple ecosystem services with implications for local and national economies. Here we review and analyse a large number of scientific publications, which are little known outside Russia, and we provide insights into Siberian biodiversity issues for the wider international research community. Case studies are presented on biodiversity changes for insect pests, fish, amphibians and reptiles, birds, mammals and steppe vegetation, and we discuss their causes and consequences. © 2021, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Many countries allow lawsuits to hold responsible parties liable for the environmental harm they cause. Such litigation remains largely untested in most biodiversity hotspots and is rarely used in response to leading drivers of biodiversity loss, including illegal wildlife trade. Yet, liability litigation is a potentially ground-breaking conservation strategy to remedy harm to biodiversity by seeking legal remedies such as species rehabilitation, public apologies, habitat conservation and education, with the goal of making the injured parties ‘whole’. However, precedent cases, expert guidance, and experience to build such conservation lawsuits is nascent in most countries. We propose a simplified framework for developing conservation lawsuits across countries and conservation contexts. We explain liability litigation in terms of three dimensions: (1) defining the harm that occurred, (2) identifying appropriate remedies to that harm, and (3) understanding what remedies the law and courts will allow. We illustrate the framework via a hypothetical lawsuit against an illegal orangutan trader in Indonesia. We highlight that conservationists’ expertise is essential to characterizing harm and identifying remedies, and could more actively contribute to strategic, science-based litigation. This would identify priority contexts, target defendants responsible for egregious harm, propose novel and meaningful remedies, and build new transdisciplinary collaborations. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Invasive non-native species (INNS) pose a risk as vectors of parasitic organisms (Invasive Parasites). Introducing invasive parasites can result in ecological disturbances, leading to biodiversity loss and native species illness/mortality, but occasionally can control INNS limiting their impact. Risks to human health and the economy are also associated with INNS and invasive parasites; however, we understand little about the diversity of symbiotic organisms co-invading alongside INNS. This lack of clarity is an important aspect of the ‘One Health’ prerogative, which aims to bridge the gap between human, wildlife, and ecosystem health. To explore symbiont diversity associated with the invasive crustacean group (including: crab, lobster, crayfish, shrimp, amphipod, isopod, copepod, barnacle, other) (n = 323) derived from 1054 aquatic invertebrates classed as INNS across databases, we compile literature (year range 1800–2017) from the native and invasive range to provide a cumulative symbiont profile for each species. Our search indicated that 31.2% of INN crustaceans were known to hold at least one symbiont, whereby the remaining 68.8% had no documented symbionts. The symbiont list mostly consisted of helminths (27% of the known diversity) and protists (23% of the known diversity), followed by bacteria (12%) and microsporidians (12%). Carcinus maenas, the globally invasive and extremely well-studied green crab, harboured the greatest number of symbionts (n = 72). Additional screening is imperative to become more informed on invasive symbiont threats. We reveal that few studies provide truly empirical data that connect biodiversity loss with invasive parasites and suggest that dedicated studies on available systems will help to provide vital case studies. Despite the lack of empirical data, co-invasive parasites of invasive invertebrates appear capable of lowering local biodiversity, especially by causing behavioural change and mortality in native species. Alternatively, several invasive parasites appear to protect ecosystems by controlling the impact and population size of their invasive host. We provide a protocol that could be followed to explore symbiont diversity in invasive groups as part of our case studies. The consequence of limited parasite screening of INNS, in addition to the impacts invasive parasites impart on local ecologies, are explored throughout the review. We conclude in strong support of the ‘One Health’ prerogative and further identify a need to better explore disease in invasion systems, many of which are accountable for economic, human health and ecological diversity impacts. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Emerging infectious diseases are one of the multiple factors contributing to the current “biodiversity crisis”. As part of the worldwide biodiversity crisis, amphibian populations are declining globally. Chytridiomycosis, an emerging infectious disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is a major cause of amphibian population declines. This fungus primarily affects keratinized structures in larval, juvenile, and adult amphibians as well as heart function. However, we know little about how Bd can impact embryos as well as potential latent effects of Bd exposure over ontogeny. Using two different Bd strains and multiple exposure times, we examined the effects of Bd exposure in Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla), Western toad (Anaxyrus boreas) and American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) life stages. Using a factorial experimental design, embryos of these three species were exposed to Bd at early and late embryonic stages, with some individuals re-exposed after hatching. Embryonic Bd exposure resulted in differential survival as a function of host species, Bd strain and timing of exposure. P. regilla experienced embryonic mortality when exposed during later developmental stages to one Bd strain. There were no differences across the treatments in embryonic mortality of A. boreas and embryonic mortality of L. catesbeianus occurred in all Bd exposure treatments. We detected latent effects in A. boreas and L. catesbeianus larvae, as mortality increased when individuals had been exposed to any of the Bd strains during the embryonic stage. We also detected direct effects on larval mortality in all three anuran species as a function of Bd strain, and when individuals were double exposed (late in the embryonic stage and again as larvae). Our results suggest that exposure to Bd can directly affect embryo survival and has direct and latent effects on larvae survival of both native and invasive species. However, these impacts were highly context dependent, with timing of exposure and Bd strain influencing the severity of the effects. Copyright © 2021 Urbina, Bredeweg, Blaustein and Garcia.},

abstract={Coral reefs are experiencing declines due to climate change and local human impacts. While at a local scale these impacts induce biodiversity loss and shifts in community structure, previous biogeographical analyses recorded consistent taxonomic structure of fish communities across global coral reefs. This suggests that regional communities represent a random subset of the global species and traits pool, whatever their species richness. Using distributional data on 3586 fish species and latest advances in species distribution models, we show marked gradients in the prevalence of size classes and diet categories across the biodiversity gradient. This divergence in trait structure is best explained by reef isolation during past unfavourable climatic conditions, with large and piscivore fishes better represented in isolated areas. These results suggest the risk of a global community re-organization if the ongoing climate-induced reef fragmentation is not halted. © 2021 The Author(s).},

abstract={Urban humans and biodiversity-related concepts are interacting with each other in many negative and positive ways. The biodiversity provides a wide array of provision and cultural-ecological services to urban residents, but it is being overexploited to the point of crisis. The crisis is largely driven by the expanding illegal wildlife trade in developing countries with a high urbanization rate and biodiversity level like Vietnam. While supply-side measures are ineffective in reducing biodiversity loss, researchers have suggested demand-side measures as supplements, such as social marketing campaigns and law enforcement in urban areas. Moreover, urban residents are also potential visitors to urban public parks and national parks, which helps generate finance for biodiversity preservation and conservation in those places. Understanding how urban residents’ perceptions towards biodiversity and biodiversity-related behaviors can help improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts and sustainable urban development. Thus, this article presents a data set of 535 urban residents’ wildlife consumption behaviors, multifaceted perceptions and interactions with biodiversity-related concepts, and nature-based recreation demand. The data set is constructed with six major categories: 1) wildlife product consumption, 2) general biodiversity perceptions, 3) biodiversity at home and neighborhood, 4) public park visitation and motivations, 5) national park visitation and motivations, and 6) socio-demographic profiles. These resources are expected to support researchers in enriching the lax literature regarding the role of urban residents in biodiversity conservation and preservation, and help policymakers to find insights for building up an “eco-surplus culture” among urban residents through effective public communication and policymaking. © 2021 Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={The interaction between the Anthroposphere and the Biosphere has resulted in increasingly rapid biodiversity loss. This negative interaction is influenced by attitudes (feelings, actions, and perceptions) of humans towards certain species. Despite the importance of reptiles in food chains and ecosystem services, they are often negatively perceived, resulting in fear and persecution. In this scenario, Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) may contribute for students to develop positive attitudes towards nature and, in particular, towards reptile conservation. Some studies showed that watching wildlife movies improves attitudes of people towards wildlife. However, few information is available on the impact of engaging people in movie production in their attitudes on biodiversity. Here we present an exploratory case study and describe a project-based learning activity (PBL) implemented with Cabo Verdean high-school students and planned to improve their perceptions, feelings and actions towards reptiles in general, and the threatened endemic species C. vaillanti in particular. We asked students to write a script, shoot and produce a short film that could improve the attitudes of their community towards this endemic species. This movie was then presented to the community in a public event and subjected to a content analysis. To evaluate the impact of the activity on students, they were asked to fill in two questionnaires, before and after the activity. Our results showed significant increase of positive feelings of students about the reptiles, and increased perception of their importance, and of positive actions towards C. vaillanti from pre to post test. The movie content analyses and interviews showed that students learned about species biology, threats and reasons for its conservation, of which endemicity was the most frequently cited. Our findings support the value of engaging the public in PBL for EDS and the positive impacts of this engagement in public attitudes towards species conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={River fragmentation caused by instream barriers is a leading cause of biodiversity loss, particularly for freshwater migratory fish, the vertebrate group that has suffered the steepest decline. However, most studies have tended to focus on the impacts of large dams on only a few taxa. We estimated the cumulative impact of both large and small barriers on fish species richness and relative abundance along an altitudinal gradient in the main stem of the River Allier (France). Using eDNA metabarcoding, we identified 24 fish zero-radius operational taxonomic units (zOTUs), corresponding to 26 species distributed along the main stem of the river. Elevation explained the greatest amount of variation in fish distribution, together with average flow, barrier density and its interaction with cumulative barrier height. Based on eDNA, the largest discontinuity in species richness was not related to the location of Poutès, the largest dam in the system, but located downstream from it. Our results indicate that, in addition to the more obvious effects of large dams on migratory fish such as the Atlantic salmon, the cumulative effects of small barriers can have widespread impacts on fish species richness and relative abundance, which should not be overlooked. We suggest that, as for other fragmented rivers, acting on numerous small barriers might bring about greater benefits in fish species richness than focusing only on the largest dams. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={The impacts of human-induced environmental change that characterize the Anthropocene are not felt equally across the globe. In the tropics, the potential for the sudden collapse of ecosystems in response to multiple interacting pressures has been of increasing concern in ecological and conservation research. The tropical ecosystems of Papua New Guinea are areas of diverse rainforest flora and fauna, inhabited by human populations that are equally diverse, both culturally and linguistically. These people and the ecosystems they rely on are being put under increasing pressure from mineral resource extraction, population growth, land clearing, invasive species, and novel pollutants. This study details the last ∼90 y of impacts on ecosystem dynamics in one of the most biologically diverse, yet poorly understood, tropical wetland ecosystems of the region. The lake is listed as a Ramsar wetland of international importance, yet, since initial European contact in the 1930s and the opening of mineral resource extraction facilities in the 1990s, there has been a dramatic increase in deforestation and an influx of people to the area. Using multiproxy paleoenvironmental records from lake sediments, we show how these anthropogenic impacts have transformed Lake Kutubu. The recent collapse of algal communities represents an ecological tipping point that is likely to have ongoing repercussions for this important wetland’s ecosystems. We argue that the incorporation of an adequate historical perspective into models for wetland management and conservation is critical in understanding how to mitigate the impacts of ecological catastrophes such as biodiversity loss. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Finding new pathways for reconciling socioeconomic well-being and nature sustainability is critically important for contemporary societies, especially in tropical developing countries where sustaining local livelihoods often clashes with biodiversity conservation. Many projects aimed at reconciling the goals of biodiversity conservation and social aspirations within protected areas (PAs) have failed on one or both counts. Here, we investigate the social consequences of living either inside or outside sustainable-use PAs in the Brazilian Amazon, using data from more than 100 local communities along a 2,000-km section of a major Amazonian river. The PAs in this region are now widely viewed as conservation triumphs, having implemented community comanagement of fisheries and recovery of overexploited wildlife populations. We document clear differences in social welfare in communities inside and outside PAs. Specifically, communities inside PAs enjoy better access to health care, education, electricity, basic sanitation, and communication infrastructure. Moreover, living within a PA was the strongest predictor of household wealth, followed by cash-transfer programs and the number of people per household. These collective cobenefits clearly influence life satisfaction, with only 5% of all adult residents inside PAs aspiring to move to urban centers, compared with 58% of adults in unprotected areas. Our results clearly demonstrate that large-scale “win–win” conservation solutions are possible in tropical countries with limited financial and human resources and reinforce the need to genuinely empower local people in integrated conservation-development programs. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Human activities are driving a global biodiversity crisis. In response, a broad range of conservation actions have been implemented. With finite resources available, and a rapidly narrowing window, the scientific and policy communities have acknowledged the need to better understand the effectiveness of interventions for conserving threatened species. Given the recent emphasis on the use of counter wildlife crime interventions (i.e. those that directly protect wildlife from illegal harvest, detect and sanction rule-breakers, and interdict and control illegal wildlife commodities), there is a clear need to summarize the available evidence on biological and threat reduction outcomes of such actions to help make evidence-informed management and funding decisions. Here, we present a protocol for a systematic map that will collate the existing body of literature addressing the effectiveness of counter-wildlife crime interventions for protecting targeted species. Our focus will be on select species or species groups directly threatened by exploitation (i.e. illegal harming whether by harvest as a resource or for control/persecution) and native to Africa, Asia and Latin America, which are regions that have experienced significant wildlife populations declines. The systematic map will aim to capture available evidence found in commercially published and grey literature. We will search for the literature using four publication databases, Google Scholar, 36 specialist websites and databases and sources identified through a call for evidence among relevant networks. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two stages: (1) title and abstract and (2) full text. Relevant information from included papers will be extracted and entered into a searchable, coded database (MS-Excel). Narrative synthesis and descriptive statistics will describe the key characteristics of the relevant evidence base (e.g. geographic location, species, interventions, direct threats, outcomes and study designs). Using visual heat maps, we will identify key knowledge gaps warranting further research and clusters of evidence that could serve as topics for future systematic reviews. The resulting map will guide further exploration on evaluating the effectiveness of counter-wildlife crime interventions, and aid in building an evidence base that supports both management and funding decisions to ensure efficient use of limited resources and maximal conservation benefits. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Introduction: Worldwide, coastal habitats are experiencing increasing pressure from pollution, coastal development, fisheries, and climate change. Identifying and recording coastal biodiversity is essential to assess ecosystem health, changes and the extent of biodiversity loss. Coastal tropical habitats such as coral reefs and seagrass beds have been the research focus for scientists during the last decades; however, other ecosystems have been neglected, such as macroalgae forests, subtidal (20-30 m deep) sedimentary bottoms, and rocky reefs. Objective: Our study reports the marine biodiversity associated with rocky reefs, coral reefs, Sargassum forests and sedimentary subtidal bottoms (20-30 m deep), in a tropical seasonal upwelling area (Santa Elena Peninsula, Santa Elena Bay, and Murciélago Islands, Costa Rica). Methods: During the ‘Santa Elena Expedition’ (April 21-May 2 2018), a total of 28 sites were visited in order to record the biodiversity across four different habitats (rocky and coral reefs, Sargassum forests, subtidal sedimentary bottoms), using SCUBA and both systematic surveys and visual assessments; in some sedimentary bottoms a 20-minute dredge tows were done. Results: A total of 254 taxa were identified, being bony fishes the most diverse group (91 species), followed by gastropods (25 spp.), red algae (21 spp.) and anthozoans (19 spp.). We report four new records for the Pacific mainland of Costa Rica, including the subclass of tube-dwelling sea anemone (Ceriantharia). Conclusions: Our results show that Santa Elena Peninsula, Santa Elena Bay, and Murciélago Islands harbor uncommon and unstudied habitats, such as Sargassum forests, sedimentary bottoms, reefs constructed by the stony coral Pavona gigantea –which is very unusual– and rocky reef communities dominated by calcareous colonies of polychaetes (Salmacina tribranchiata). © 2021, Universidad de Costa Rica.

abstract={Kaptai Lake (KL), the largest inland watershed in Bangladesh (ca. 700 km2 ) and one of Southeast Asia’s largest artificial reservoirs, features an abundant variety of indigenous fishery species. Moreover, it provides a plethora of ecological benefits to society. Nevertheless, the KL is suffering from multidimensional natural and anthropogenic stressors that threaten these wetlands’ sustainability. Though the legal framework assures sustainable conservation of fisheries resources, the implementation scenarios of fisheries laws, regulations, and policies in the KL wetland are insufficient. This study aimed at assessing the fisher’s perception of the regulation implementation efficiency of the Protection and Conservation Fish Act of 1950, while analyzing the effectiveness of the legal framework in the context of biodiversity conservation and the management sustainability of KL. By integrating qualitative and quantitative data collected through participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools viz. 225 interviews with fishers, four focus group discussions, and 12 key informant interviews, the investigation was performed in four selected areas in KL. The findings show that fishers routinely disregard laws and restrictions of the Protection and Conservation of Fish Act 1950 due to various socioeconomic and political forces. Although the annual fish harvest rate from KL appears to be increasing, the lake is losing its charismatic biological diversity primarily due to inappropriate and ineffective enforcement of fishing regulations. Many fishers believe that they still follow the act’s significant laws and regulations while being involved in several destructive and prohibited fishing practices. There is a link between community awareness, the scope of the act’s provisions, the effectiveness of its enforcement, and the strength of its execution. One of the leading causes of biodiversity loss in the KL is inadequate and ineffective fishing regulations. Improvement in the enforcement of the fishing act may be the prominent option to ensure better biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of this wetland. This result calls for functional and policy attention to revising the regulations to account for socioeconomic and political elements contributing to environmental degradation. This study also highlights the urgent need for transdisciplinary collaboration initiatives and synchronous cooperation among the agencies in order to effectively implement the fishing laws and contribute to better conservation and sustainability of the Kaptai lake fisheries resources. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Understanding how perturbations to trophic interactions influence virus–host dynamics is essential in the face of ongoing biodiversity loss and the continued emergence of RNA viruses and their associated zoonoses. Herein, we investigated the role of predator exclusion on rodent communities and the seroprevalence of hantaviruses within the Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbaracayú (RNBM), which is a protected area of the Interior Atlantic Forest (IAF). In the IAF, two sympatric rodent reservoirs, Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys nigripes, harbor Jaborá and Juquitiba hantavirus (JABV, JUQV), respectively. In this study, we employed two complementary methods for predator exclusion: comprehensive fencing and trapping/removal. The goal of exclusion was to preclude the influence of predation on small mammals on the sampling grids and thereby potentially reduce rodent mortality. Following baseline sampling on three grid pairs with different habitats, we closed the grids and began predator removal. By sampling three habitat types, we controlled for habitat-specific effects, which is important for hantavirus–reservoir dynamics in neotropical ecosystems. Our six-month predator exclusion experiment revealed that the exclusion of terrestrial mammalian predators had little influence on the rodent community or the population dynamics of A. montensis and O. nigripes. Instead, fluctuations in species diversity and species abundances were influenced by sampling session and forest degradation. These results suggest that seasonality and landscape composition play dominant roles in the prevalence of hantaviruses in rodent reservoirs in the IAF ecosystem. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The high economic costs of human–wildlife conflicts (HWC) hinder long-term conservation successes, especially in developing countries. We investigated HWC by interviewing 498 respondents from 42 villages in Nowshera district, Pakistan. According to respondents, six species—the common leopard (Panthera pardus), grey wolf (Canis lupus), golden jackal (Canis aureus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), and wild boar (Sus scrofa)—were involved in livestock predation and crop-raiding. Livestock predation (N = 670) translated into a total annual economic loss of USD 48,490 across the 42 villages, with the highest economic loss of USD 57.1/household/year attributed to the golden jackal. Crop damage by wild boar and porcupine incurred a total annual economic loss of USD 18,000. Results further showed that livestock predation was highly affected by location, prey type, prey age, and herding practices, while cereals and vegetables were preferred crops for wild boar and Indian porcupine. The grey wolf was declared as the most dangerous carnivore, followed by the golden jackal and common leopard. Negative attitude about golden jackal and wild boar prevails among 90% of the respondents of the study area. We strongly assume that the abundance of apex predators can control the economic impacts of meso-carnivores and wild boar on the community’s livelihood. Keeping relatively smaller herds may reduce carnivore attacks and educating the populous and compensation can minimise negative perceptions of HWC. To reduce HWC in the study area, there should be an incessant and timely coordination between wildlife officials and the local community. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Community-based conservation is advocated as an idea that long-term conservation success requires engaging with, providing benefits for, and establishing institutions representing local communities. However, community-based conservation’s efficacy and impact in sustainable resource management varies depending on national natural resource policies and implications for local institutional arrangements. This paper analyses the significance of natural resource management policies and institutional design on the management of common pool resources (CPRs), by comparing Namibian conservancies and community forests. To meet this aim, we reviewed key national policies pertinent to natural resource governance and conducted 28 semi-structured interviews between 2012 and 2013. Key informants included conservancy and community forest staff and committee members, village headmen, NGO coordinators, regional foresters, wildlife officials (wardens), and senior government officials in the Ministry of Environment and Tourism and the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry. We explored the following questions: how do national natural resource management policies affect the operations of local common pool resource institutions? and how do external factors affect local institutions and community participation in CPRs decision-making? Our results show that a diversity of national policies significantly influenced local institutional arrangements. Formation of conservancies and community forests by communities is not only directly linked with state policies designed to increase wildlife numbers and promote forest growth or improve condition, but also formulated primarily for benefits from and control over natural resources. The often-assumed direct relationship between national policies and local institutional arrangements does not always hold in practice, resulting in institutional mismatch. We aim to advance theoretical and applied discourse on common pool resource governance in social-ecological systems, with implications for sustainable land management policies in Namibia and other landscapes across sub-Saharan Africa. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The introduction of exotic species is one of the major causes for biodiversity loss in marine environments. Introduced species can change habitat complexity, impacting local communities and altering ecosystem functioning. Since the 1980s, the scleractinian species Tubastraea coccinea and Tubastraea. tagusensis (commonly known as sun corals) have been spreading in the south-western Atlantic, posing a major threat to local biodiversity and marine ecosystems. Nowadays, these species are reported from more than 3,500 km along the Brazilian coast and on at least 21 oil and gas offshore platforms. Considering the great environmental pressure resulting from sun coral invasion, this study verified the effectiveness of manual removal of Tubastraea spp. along a rocky shore in Alcatrazes Wildlife Refuge, one of the most pristine marine regions in Brazil. Results indicate that removal is indeed effective as a control technique; however, as invaders have high regeneration capabilities and recruitment rates, successive management efforts are essential. In order for management to be effective against Tubastraea's year-round release of clonal larvae, results suggest invaded areas should receive at least two management actions per year. Successive management efforts, in addition to the development of new techniques and prevention of new invasions should be priorities for mitigating sun coral impacts. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Human activities are driving many species to the brink of extinction, and the current distribution of protected areas only weakly alleviates pressure on threatened species. This discrepancy reflects the presence of protected areas on lands available instead of the ecological, evolutionary, or conservation values of species present. Habitat loss consequently continues to impact threatened species, as illustrated by geographic patterns of biodiversity loss for amphibians. Given the need to better align the boundaries of protected areas with at-risk biodiversity, we assessed the importance of various factors for identifying global and biome-level conservation priority areas, specifically for amphibians. We identified, mapped, and ranked areas of critical conservation importance for all amphibian species on earth using a new integrative tool that scores the urgency of conserving each species and location based on a combination of species characteristics and ecoregion-level human impacts. Our integrative approach is novel in that it accounts for likely threats to Data Deficient species, considers the irreplaceability of unique species that are phylogenetically isolated, and addresses the localized conservation implications of species endemicity and projected future human impacts to an ecoregion. For comparison, we also mapped and ranked amphibian biodiversity using species richness and an Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) score proxy. Our integrative approach predicted key regions for amphibian conservation that were not apparent when using a simple species richness or EDGE score proxy-based approach. Furthermore, by scaling conservation priority scores relative to biome, we identified several temperate and xeric regions of crucial yet overlooked conservation importance for amphibians. Until global amphibian diversity is thoroughly catalogued, we recommend using our integrative scoring approach to set geographic priorities for amphibian habitat protection, while acknowledging that this approach may be complemented by others (e.g., EDGE scores). Our study provides an avenue for avoiding common pitfalls of more simplistic species richness-based approaches for conservation planning, and can be used to improve the future design of protected areas. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Habitat degradation and land-use change driven by the livestock sector are among the major causes of global biodiversity loss. Forests are crucial in maintaining biodiversity and mitigating climate change. Apart from continuing deforestation, forests also face increasing pressure from livestock grazing in the system, which is less understood compared to grasslands. Through a meta-analysis of 156 articles with 1936 data entries, this study assesses the effect of livestock on forest biodiversity, structure, and functions, varying with livestock types, livestock density, grazing history, and climatic factors. Our results show that livestock overall had a negative impact on the forest structure and functions, reduced species abundance but increased richness. Medium and large mammals, plant communities, and soil were more negatively affected compared to other groups such as birds and invertebrates. Livestock also influenced the role of forests in mitigating climate change. They changed forest carbon stock by reducing plant biomass; however, they did not significantly impact the soil carbon stock or soil greenhouse gas emissions. Ecosystem attributes were more affected in warmer and drier regions and by single species grazing than the mixed grazing. Past livestock grazing history moderates the impacts of livestock, with the strongest negative effect occurred with a history of 1–5 years. Nonetheless, livestock activities also had a positive impact on forest management, such as reducing forest flammability. Our results also indicate the lack of studies on how higher trophic levels respond to livestock disturbances and how grazing intensity moderates the effect, which includes grazing duration and livestock density. The complex responses of forests to livestock in different conditions call for more adaptive management depending on the conservation targets and evolution history. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Climate change impacts are important in shaping large ecotones, such as the transition zone between the Cerrado and Amazon rainforest (CAT) biogeographical domains. The accelerating rate of conversion of native vegetation, the most important factor for biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene, compounded by projected climate change impacts, requires a review of the effectiveness of existing designated protected areas (PA) and indigenous land (IL), where low-intensity and low-impact land use prevails. We identified priority tree species for conservation and quantified changes in their projected spatial distribution in future climate scenarios to estimate the conservation effectiveness of the current network of PA and IL in the CAT. Applying niche-based models to compare the geographical range of species in current and future climates, we estimated the displacement of species from their current distribution owing to projected climate change. We used four different IPCC emission scenarios for 2050 and quantified the losses or gains in species richness in PA and IL. All species were projected to suffer a reduction of climatically suitable area and a consequent range reduction. Inside both PA and IL there was a projected decrease in richness of the target species under climate change. The current PA network and designated IL in the CAT do not appear to safeguard future conservation of the species they currently contain. The future ‘climate refugia’ that our work identified could form the basis of plans to expand the protected area network in a region that remains under ever increasing pressure of deforestation in Brazil. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={As the global biodiversity crisis continues, it is important to examine the legislative protection that is in place for species around the world. Such legislation not only includes environmental or wildlife law, but also trade law, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which gets transposed into national legislation. This commentary analyses legislative definitions of wildlife, whether or not that includes fish, which has implications for fish welfare, use of fish for food security, and biodiversity conservation when fish, or other wildlife, are excluded. Through a legislative content analysis of the 183 parties’ legislation of CITES, we explore whether fish are afforded the same protections as other species by being included in legal definitions of wildlife. We found that while a majority of CITES parties’ legislation appear to define fish as wildlife, there are a number of instances where this is unclear or not the case, and this could have significant ramifications for the welfare of non-human animals, their use, and conservation. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Context: The current biodiversity crisis has intensified the need to predict species responses to landscape modification and has renewed attention on the fundamental question of what influences the dynamics of species distributions. Landscape composition can affect two main components that dictate distributions: habitat suitability and habitat connectivity. Elucidating the relative importance of these factors and associated landscape features can help prioritize management action for species conservation. Objectives: Our objective was to use species distribution models and network-based landscape connectivity models to understand which landscape factors were most predictive of the distribution of an anuran, Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris blanchardi), in an agriculturally-dominated landscape. Methods: We conducted our study in Ohio, USA, near the edge of the cricket frog’s contracting range. To obtain a current assessment of cricket frog distribution, we surveyed 367 pond and stream locations across three North–South transects. We then tested seven regression models, combining habitat suitability and landscape connectivity metrics, to determine which factors best predicted cricket frog presence. Results: We detected cricket frogs in 24% of surveyed locations and they were more likely to occupy pond sites than stream sites. Cricket frog presence was best predicted by models with habitat suitability and the number of interconnected habitat patches. We found that, while there was high variation in habitat suitability across the study area, landscape connectivity was relatively uniform where we surveyed. Conclusions: Agricultural landscapes around the world are often mosaics of land cover types, which may functionally provide connectivity for some species. In such areas, conservation management should focus on preserving and restoring regions of highly suitable habitat. This focus may be particularly relevant for species that do not appear to be dispersal limited and, therefore, able to maintain metapopulation dynamics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Landscape simplification and degradation through agricultural intensification is widely recognized as a main driver of biodiversity loss. In intensively used agricultural landscapes, patches of semi-natural habitats and particularly connections between them are of high importance for many taxa. Vegetated connections like hedgerows are especially important for foraging and commuting of mobile taxa such as bats. However, the interest of another treeless linear habitat – herbaceous field margins – remains unstudied for insectivorous bats. Field margins are nevertheless known as an important habitat for other taxa, including bat prey. Here we assessed the importance of field margins for bats compared to other landscape variables. We measured bat activity based on a repeated passive acoustic monitoring during 17 complete nights in summer on 112 study sites in an intensively used agricultural landscape. Each night, we sampled bat species activity and community metrics (i.e. species richness and community habitat specialization index) at different distances to field margins, and along a gradient of relative density of field margins. To compare field margin effects with other landscape variables, the sampled sites were selected by keeping a large variability in these other variables (land-cover Shannon diversity index, forests, hedgerows, water bodies, main roads, urban areas, grasslands, number of crops and rapeseed percentage). Only Myotis sp. were affected by herbaceous field margins. Specifically, the Myotis group activity decreased with the distance to herbaceous field margins (i.e. towards field crop cores), and positively correlated with relative density of herbaceous field margins, for which the effect size was comparable to other landscape variables. However, other landscape variables such as the proportion of and the distance to forests, the relative density of and the distance to hedgerows or land-cover Shannon diversity index, affected species richness, community specialization index, and bat activity of species from open, edge and narrow-space foragers, including the Myotis group as well. Our results highlight that herbaceous field margins have a positive effect on the activity of narrow-space bat foragers as Myotis species, but do not replace other landscape variables that drive the activity of the whole community. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={How does the state see nature? Has the emergence of “environmental states” with significant environmental laws and policy changed the state's vision towards nonhumans, particularly endangered wildlife? These are key questions in a paradoxical context where over the past half century, endangered wildlife have largely continued to decline amid expanding state environmental legislation. Towards answers, we analyze how endangered marine animals in Canada are considered in federal environmental assessments (EAs) that inform state decisions about whether to authorize major development projects. We conducted an inductive content analysis of all federal EAs for projects with potential adverse effects for one or more of the 14 endangered marine vertebrates in Canada. Of 32 projects, 31 were approved, 30 of which were predicted to have no or insignificant impacts on endangered marine species, despite a litany of potential impacts. This analysis reveals four main justifications for predicting insignificant impacts: unproven mitigation measures; species are presumed to have a low likelihood of occurrence in project areas; species behaviour is believed to reduce the likelihood of impacts; and project impacts are characterized as minor compared to existing activity. A consistent vision of nature underpins these justifications: the state sees marine species and ocean ecologies in a simplified manner, while these species also remain strategically illegible. Simplification and strategic illegibility both devalue endangered marine animals, suggesting EA is failing endangered marine species by facilitating the state's ability to prioritize development over species recovery. © 2021},

abstract={Context: Historically, habitat edges were thought to increase diversity by combining communities from two habitats, but empirical results are mixed. Variation in edge responses may be driven by lumping specialists and generalists with divergent responses. Objectives: We examined arthropod communities associated with a habitat edge in an intertidal salt marsh in New Jersey. We predicted that herbivores, largely specialists, would decline along the habitat edge due to their failure to expand across the boundary, and specialist natural enemies should track prey. Generalists should be less impacted by the edge if they use resources from both sides. Thus, habitat edges should affect species composition more than species diversity. Methods: We studied the edge responses of 115 arthropod species to the habitat edge formed between Spartina patens (SP) and Spartina alterniflora (SA) throughout the growing season. Results: We found that the edge between SA and SP affected the abundance and composition of the associated arthropod community, but not species richness. Composition of herbivores, epigeic feeders, specialist natural enemies, and generalist predators shifted not only between SA and SP interiors, but also the edges. Compositional shifts were driven by dietary or habitat specialists. Conclusions: We found that edges change community composition via divergent responses by species with different resource requirements. This change in composition is not between two disparate habitat types but two congeneric grass species. Our results demonstrate that biodiversity losses due to edge effects associated with habitat fragmentation will not be random but will be driven by specialization and resource use. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Agricultural intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss, with the implementation of Agri-Environment Schemes (AESs) being a widespread policy designed to prevent further loss, and to maintain or restore ecosystem health. Upland grassland soils are disproportionately impacted by intensification including drainage, artificial fertiliser use, compaction and erosion while the effect of AES management on below-ground microarthropods, which mediate a range of ecosystem processes, is largely unknown. This study tested the effects of AES management of upland grasslands on microarthropod communities using a large-scale factorial field experiment. The study focused on microarthropods with distinct taxa-specific responses observed. Oribatid mite abundance was associated with wetter, more extensive pastures with native grasses characteristic of semi-improved grassland managed by AESs, whereas Collembola abundance was associated with drier, more intense, reseeded (Lolium perenne dominated) pastures characteristic of conventionally managed improved grasslands. Differences in taxa responses may be driven by life-history traits and resilience to disturbance. There was no net effect of management, habitat or their interaction on total microarthropod family diversity or abundance. Synthesis and Applications. Results from this study suggest that in floristically simple upland agroecosystems the impact of agri-environment measures on below-ground soil biota are context-dependent (differing between contrasting grassland types), and taxa-specific, rather than leading to general increases in biodiversity per se, and the responses of soil microarthropods are driven by environmental variation caused by overall management of grassland fields. Measures should aim to increase the availability of areas of semi-improved grassland, with native plant mixtures, adjacent to improved grasslands, to maximise the habitats available to soil microarthropods. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={To remain within the limits of the planetary boundaries and address increasing disease rates due to poor eating habits, there needs to be a major shift in dietary patterns. The composition of an optimal diet changes depending on location, season, and personalized dietary needs. We develop a methodology to build a 500+ food item, nutrient, and environmental impact database specific to a given country and month, which includes several life cycle stages of a food item and calculates impacts depending on from where the item is sourced. This database is then used to develop a detailed and personalized, healthful, low impact diet by using linear optimization. We applied this methodology to several case studies to compare what low impact diets would look like depending on country (Switzerland vs. Spain), season (August vs. February), sex, the inclusion of dietary supplements, and for different diet types and impact categories (climate change and biodiversity loss). Results indicate that, although optimized diets are similar, there are marked differences in the detailed composition depending on country, season, and impact considered, especially regarding legume choice. The lowest impact diet contained local and imported foods as well as fish. Vegan diets had the lowest impact only when incorporating a supplement to meet nutrient needs. We developed a tool to be used for personalized diet composition assessments for any global geographical location and season. We anticipate this work to be useful for developing country- and season-specific dietary guidelines and for consumers hoping to reduce their own personal impacts. © 2021 by Yale University},

abstract={Illegal trade and human-wildlife conflict are two key drivers of biodiversity loss and are recognized as leading threats to large carnivores. Although human-wildlife conflict involving jaguars (Panthera onca) has received significant attention in the past, less is known about traditional use or commercial trade in jaguar body parts, including their potential links with retaliatory killing. Understanding the drivers of jaguar killing, trade and consumption is necessary to develop appropriate jaguar conservation strategies, particularly as demand for jaguar products appears to be rising due to Chinese demand. We interviewed 1107 rural households in north-western Bolivia, an area with an active history of human–jaguar conflict, which has also been at the epicentre of recent jaguar trade cases. We collected information on participants' experiences with jaguars, their jaguar killing, trading and consuming behaviours and potential drivers of these behaviours. We found that the relationships between local people and jaguars are complex and are driven largely by traditional practices, opportunism, human–jaguar conflict and market incentives from foreign and domestic demand, in the absence of law awareness and enforcement. Addressing jaguar trade and building human–jaguar coexistence will require a multifaceted approach that considers the multiple drivers of jaguar killing, trade and consumption, from foreign and local demand to human–jaguar conflict. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species (RLS) is the key global tool for objective, repeatable assessment of species’ extinction risk status, and plays an essential role in tracking biodiversity loss and guiding conservation action. Satellite remote sensing (SRS) data sets on global ecosystem distributions and functioning show exciting potential for informing range-based RLS assessment, but their incorporation has been restricted by low temporal resolution and coverage of data sets, lack of incorporation of degradation-driven habitat loss, and noninclusion of assumptions related to identification of changing habitat distributions for taxa with varying habitat dependency and ecologies. For poorly known mangrove-associated Cuban hutias (Mesocapromys spp.), we tested the impact of possible assumptions regarding these issues on range-based RLS assessment outcomes. Specifically, we used annual (1985–2018) Landsat data and land-cover classification and habitat degradation analyses across different internal time series slices to simulate range-based RLS assessments for our case study taxa to explore potential assessment uncertainty arising from temporal SRS data set coverage, incorporating proxies of (change in) habitat quality, and assumptions on spatial scaling of habitat extent for RLS parameter generation. We found extensive variation in simulated species-specific range-based RLS assessments, and this variation was mostly associated with the time series over which parameters were estimated. However, results of some species-specific assessments differed by up to 3 categories (near threatened to critically endangered) within the same time series, due to the effects of incorporating habitat quality and the spatial scaling used in RLS parameter estimation. Our results showed that a one-size-fits-all approach to incorporating SRS information in RLS assessment is inappropriate, and we urge caution in conducting range-based assessments with SRS for species for which habitat dependence on specific ecosystem types is incompletely understood. We propose novel revisions to parameter spatial scaling guidelines to improve integration of existing time series data on ecosystem change into the RLS assessment process. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The construction of dams creates a series of reservoirs, causing severe environmental changes and a biodiversity crisis. We aimed to investigate the relative roles of the construction of upstream cascade dams and the longitudinal gradient in environmental conditions in the spatial and temporal variations in fish assemblages in a downstream reservoir. Fish assemblage and abiotic data from four longitudinally distributed reaches in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China—one of the largest reservoirs worldwide—were collected over 8 years (2011–2018) and analysed. The results showed that the blockage to fish passage, as well as the flow modification, caused by the upstream dams and reservoirs can significantly affect the variations in fish assemblages downstream of the TGR; fish assemblages in the upper area of the TGR were more vulnerable to upstream dam construction than those in the lower area. The longitudinal environmental gradient was more important in determining the spatial and temporal distributions of fish assemblages in the reservoir than the combined effects caused by the upstream dams and reservoirs. The spatial distribution pattern of fish assemblage structure in the TGR was mainly determined by the gradient difference in the flow regime among stations, whereas the construction of two upstream dams mainly affected the temporal variations in fish assemblages of the TGR by altering the downstream flow and thermal regimes and blocking fish movement down to the TGR. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

abstract={With growing concern for biodiversity loss, conservationists are faced with increased pressure to depict animals in ways that evoke empathy and lead to conservation. In recent years, conservation photographers have called on scientists to assist them in identifying the best ways to depict animals to elicit an emotional response. Collaborating with conservation photographers, we used an original survey experiment with 1,152 participants to answer this call by comparing how individuals respond to traditional wildlife photography and animal portraiture. Those who were exposed to animal portraits reported increased empathy and decreased positive and relaxed emotions. We engage critical anthropomorphism, arguing that it is an essential tool to encourage conservation efforts and that animal portraiture may be an ideal “attention grabber,” after which wildlife images can serve as “educators.” As the first study to make this quantitative comparison, our findings have important implications for conservationists and particularly conservation photographers. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Ecological interactions uphold ecosystem structure and functioning. However, as species richness increases, the number of possible interactions rises exponentially. More than 6,000 species of coral reef fishes exist across the world's tropical oceans, resulting in an almost innumerable array of possible trophic interactions. Distilling general patterns in these interactions across different bioregions stands to improve our understanding of the processes that govern coral reef functioning. Here, we show that across bioregions, tropical coral reef food webs exhibit a remarkable congruence in their trophic interactions. Specifically, by compiling and investigating the structure of six coral reef food webs across distinct bioregions, we show that when accounting for consumer size and resource availability, these food webs share more trophic interactions than expected by chance. In addition, coral reef food webs are dominated by dietary specialists, which makes trophic pathways vulnerable to biodiversity loss. Prey partitioning among these specialists is geographically consistent, and this pattern intensifies when weak interactions are disregarded. Our results suggest that energy flows through coral reef communities along broadly comparable trophic pathways. Yet, these critical pathways are maintained by species with narrow, specialized diets, which threatens the existence of coral reef functioning in the face of biodiversity loss. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Habitat disturbance and particularly land-use change from natural habitats to forest plantations, croplands, and urban expansion have caused a rapid biodiversity loss in southern South America's temperate rainforests. In those forests, bryophytes constitute a crucial component, with important ecosystem roles. We evaluated bryophyte diversity and species turnover between native temperate forests and sites with different degrees of disturbance to gain insight into how habitat disturbance affects the bryophyte community. We used four different habitat disturbance scenarios at a temperate rainforest, comprising primary native forests, secondary forests, clear-cut areas, and abandoned Eucalyptus forest plantations. We sampled bryophytes for three years (2016 to 2018) on four substrates (rock, soil, live wood, and deadwood). We found that species richness decreases, and turnover increases as disturbance increases. Liverworts were more sensitive to habitat disturbance than mosses, reaching their highest diversity in primary forests. Substrate availability was also a key factor for the bryophyte community, as species were non-randomly distributed among them. In conclusion, habitat disturbance affects the temperate forest bryophyte community, altering its composition along with disturbance conditions. Considering the crucial roles that bryophytes play within the ecosystem, these changes can also affect bird and mammal species that use them as nesting material. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The excessive application of chemical fertilizers in intensively managed agricultural fields worldwide has resulted in soil degradation and biodiversity loss. This has contributed to a growing interest in sustainable management, such as organic farming. Until now, studies addressing the impact of conventional and organic management on soil biodiversity and functioning have mainly focused on arable farming and only a few reports are available on vegetable production. Vegetable farming is of particular interest, since management intensity is usually very high and there is an increasing demand for vegetable products. Soil nematodes are useful indicators of management intensity on soil ecosystem functioning because they occupy several trophic levels in soil micro-food webs and play a crucial role in nutrient cycling, pest suppression, and the regulation of microbial communities. In this study, we assessed the impact of management intensity and farming system on the community structure and functional guilds of soil nematodes, comparing 20 conventional vegetable fields, 20 organic vegetable fields, and 20 extensive grasslands in Switzerland, analyzing over 30'000 nematode individuals and detecting 98 different nematode genera. We found significant differences in the community structure and functional composition across three farming systems. Extensive grasslands contained the highest nematode abundance, followed by organic vegetable fields, and conventional vegetable fields, indicating a decline due to land-use intensification. Organic farming led to a significant increase in the abundance of herbivores (+82%), bacterivores (+206%) and omnivores (+135%) in comparison with conventional farming. Organic management also enhanced composite (+195%) and herbivores (+451%) footprints, suggesting greater carbon and energy enrichment in soil food web through these functional groups. Community composition of soil nematodes varied significantly across the three farming systems, with each farming system fostering specific indicator taxa. In conclusion, our results show that farming system has a major impact on soil nematode communities with increasing nematode populations under organic vegetable farming. Although organic vegetable production may benefit from enhanced soil fertility due to increased population densities of microbe feeding and omnivorous nematodes, the threat from plant parasitic nematodes to vegetable production requires attention and control strategies should be developed further. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={As the global biodiversity crisis deepens, with increasing habitat fragmentation and a changing climate, innovative options for conserving species are being explored. One such conservation action is genetic rescue: introduction of new alleles to promote population fitness. However, for critically endangered species where only one viable population remains, options for introducing new alleles are limited. Interspecies hybridization offers a potential solution but requires resolution of evolutionary relationships, a sound understanding of species biology, social license, and permissive legislative frameworks. Here, we show how phylogenetics and species biology can inform genetic rescue options for the orange-bellied parrot (OBP; Neophema chrysogaster), a critically endangered Australian bird with one small remaining wild population. Our phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial genomes and nuclear loci for all congeneric species provided strong support for OBPs being the sister species to a group comprising elegant, rock, and blue-winged parrots. Accounting for species distribution, behavior, and ecology, a captive trial of interspecific hybridization with the blue-winged parrot is recommended, including assessment of the fitness of hybrid individuals. Introduction of new alleles into the OBP genome would achieve the conservation goal of improving genetic diversity in a critically endangered species. Concurrently, legislative issues will need to be resolved. © 2021 The Authors. Conservation Science and Practice published by Wiley Periodicals LLC. on behalf of Society for Conservation Biology},

abstract={Forests, and the vertebrate species within them, are irreplaceable sources of food and nutrition for millions of people living in areas of high biodiversity. Unfortunately, many of these forests are being cleared for agriculture, and many animals are threatened with extinction from unsustainable hunting. Forest clearing and the hunting of threatened species are untenable solutions to long-term food insecurity and adequate nutrition, jeopardizing these species' survival, the healthy functioning of ecosystems, and the cultural identities of local people. Working with communities to develop culturally appropriate ways for people to obtain sustainable and legal sources of food from forests outside of protected areas is a key component of improving both conservation and food security. We tested the feasibility, suitability, and viability of farming an abundant and traditionally eaten forest insect, Zanna tenebrosa (locally known as sakondry), in rural communities whose food security relies heavily on the hunting of threatened vertebrates. We found that the insect is high in macro- and micronutrients, and can be cheaply, easily, and sustainably cultivated to sustainably diversify forest food systems without increasing habitat loss. Given the range of Z. tenebrosa, which covers a broad swath of central Africa, increasing production of this native insect may support multipronged agroecological approaches to promoting food security, adequate nutrition, and wildlife conservation. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Understanding the population dynamics of highly mobile, widely distributed, oceanic sharks, many of which are overexploited, is necessary to aid their conservation management. We investigated the global population genomics of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), a circumglobally distributed, apex predator displaying remarkable behavioral versatility in its diet, habitat use (near coastal, coral reef, pelagic), and individual movement patterns (spatially resident to long-distance migrations). We genotyped 242 tiger sharks from 10 globally distributed locations at more than 2000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Although this species often conducts massive distance migrations, the data show strong genetic differentiation at both neutral (FST = 0.125-0.144) and candidate outlier loci (FST = 0.570-0.761) between western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific sharks, suggesting the potential for adaptation to the environments specific to these oceanic regions. Within these regions, there was mixed support for population differentiation between northern and southern hemispheres in the western Atlantic, and none for structure within the Indian Ocean. Notably, the results demonstrate a low level of population differentiation of tiger sharks from the remote Hawaiian archipelago compared with sharks from the Indian Ocean (FST = 0.003-0.005, P < 0.01). Given concerns about biodiversity loss and marine ecosystem impacts caused by overfishing of oceanic sharks in the midst of rapid environmental change, our results suggest it imperative that international fishery management prioritize conservation of the evolutionary potential of the highly genetically differentiated Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of this unique apex predator. Furthermore, we suggest targeted management attention to tiger sharks in the Hawaiian archipelago based on a precautionary biodiversity conservation perspective. © 2021 The American Genetic Association. 2021.

abstract={Road maintenance in winter using de-icing agents, which is widely used in Eastern Europe, is the cause of water salinization in neighbouring environments, which might lead to biodiversity loss in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we investigated NaCl toxicity to test young organisms: Daphnia magna and Poecilla reticulata (standard tests organisms). The salinity of NaCl was measured by electrolytic conductivity (EC). It was statistically demonstrated that the test solutions should be prepared using natural water. For D. magna the NOEC was 7.17 mS/cm and the LC50 9.76 mS/cm. Poecilla reticulata showed resistance to salinity up to a conductivity of 25.2 mS/cm, and no lethal effects were recorded for any individual in the test population. The study showed that winter salinities recorded in inland waters (without emergencies such as sudden influx of pollutants due to industrial accidents) are unlikely to affect fish but may be hazardous to small plankton. However, the high dare of D. magna may result in a reduction of planktivorous fish. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

abstract={Extinction of species has been a recurrent phenomenon in the history of our planet, but it was generally outweighed in the course of quite a long geological time by the appearance of new species, except, especially, for the five geologically short times when the so-called “Big Five” mass extinctions occurred. Could the current decline in biodiversity be considered as a signal of an ongoing, human-driven sixth mass extinction? This note briefly examines some issues related to: (i) The hypothesized current extinction rate and the magnitude of contemporary global biodiversity loss; (ii) the challenges of comparing them to the background extinction rate and the magnitude of the past Big Five mass extinction events; (iii) briefly considering the effects of the main anthropogenic stressors on ecosystems, including the risk of the emergence of pandemic diseases. A comparison between the Pleistocene fauna dynamics with the present defaunation process and the cascading effects of recent anthropogenic actions on ecosystem structure and functioning suggests that habitat degradation, ecosystem fragmentation, and alien species introduction are important stressors increasing the negative impact on biodiversity exerted by anthropogenic-driven climate changes and their connected effects. In addition, anthropogenic ecological stressors such as urbanization, landscapes, and wildlife trade, creating new opportunities for virus transmission by augmenting human contact with wild species, are among the main factors triggering pandemic diseases. © 2021 by the author.

The pathogen has yet to be detected in Melanesia, but there have been few surveys for B. dendrobatidis in the region, and none in the Solomon Islands archipelago, a biogeographic region with a unique and culturally important frog fauna. We swabbed 200 frogs of eight species in three genera in lowland and highland sites in East Kwaio on the island of Malaita in the Solomon Islands. All frogs tested negative for the pathogen but it is possible that the pathogen is present despite non-detection, so further surveys for the pathogen are needed throughout the country. Despite this, it is safest to take a precautionary approach and assume that B. dendrobatidis has not yet been introduced to the Solomon Islands, and that naïve native amphibian populations may be at risk of decline if the pathogen is introduced. Protocols are needed to prevent the accidental import of infected frogs via tourism or in logging or mining equipment. Monitoring of frog populations near areas of high risk such as ports is also recommended. The frogs of the Solomon Islands archipelago are biologically unique and culturally significant, and protecting them from the potentially devastating impacts of B. dendrobatidis is vital. © 2020 Journal Compilation},

abstract={Aim: Although land use change is a leading cause of biodiversity loss worldwide, there is scant information on the extent to which it has affected the structure and composition of bird communities in the Afrotropical region. This study aimed to quantify the effects of habitat transformation on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in Afrotropical bird communities. Location: Nyungwe landscape, a montane rainforest with adjoining farmland in south-west Rwanda. Methods: Data on bird occurrence, abundance and functional traits were collected in 2017/18 using point counts. We also collected data on habitat and morphological traits for all bird species recorded. We quantified bird diversity using a range of metrics, including the inverse Simpson index, functional dispersion and the standardized effect size of mean nearest taxon distance. Results: In comparison with primary forest areas, even low levels of land use change altered species composition and reduced species diversity. Although overall functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity were similar across land use types, we found a significant contraction of trophic and locomotory trait structures of bird communities in restored areas and cultivated areas, respectively. Soil moisture, elevation and lower vegetation height were major factors influencing taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dimensions of bird communities, although their effects varied across these dimensions. Main conclusions: The sensitivity of forest species to minor habitat disturbance emphasizes the value of conserving primary vegetation. Long-term conservation of bird communities in Afromontane ecosystems requires halting wide-scale destruction of primary forest, promoting vegetation heterogeneity in the ecological restoration of degraded habitats and adopting wildlife-friendly agricultural practices. Our results suggest that monitoring and conservation in these landscapes can be refined using taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics to provide complementary information about the current and likely future impacts of land use change. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Australia is in the midst of an extinction crisis, having already lost 10% of terrestrial mammal fauna since European settlement and with hundreds of other species at high risk of extinction. The decline of the nation's biota is a result of an array of threatening processes; however, a comprehensive taxon-specific understanding of threats and their relative impacts remains undocumented nationally. Using expert consultation, we compile the first complete, validated, and consistent taxon-specific threat and impact dataset for all nationally listed threatened taxa in Australia. We confined our analysis to 1,795 terrestrial and aquatic taxa listed as threatened (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) under Australian Commonwealth law. We engaged taxonomic experts to generate taxon-specific threat and threat impact information to consistently apply the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme and Threat Impact Scoring System, as well as eight broad-level threats and 51 subcategory threats, for all 1,795 threatened terrestrial and aquatic threatened taxa. This compilation produced 4,877 unique taxon–threat–impact combinations with the most frequently listed threats being Habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation (n = 1,210 taxa), and Invasive species and disease (n = 966 taxa). Yet when only high-impact threats or medium-impact threats are considered, Invasive species and disease become the most prevalent threats. This dataset provides critical information for conservation action planning, national legislation and policy, and prioritizing investments in threatened species management and recovery. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The rivers of Appalachia (United States) are among the most biologically diverse freshwater ecosystems in the temperate zone and are home to numerous endemic aquatic organisms. Throughout the Central Appalachian ecoregion, extensive surface coal mines generate alkaline mine drainage that raises the pH, salinity, and trace element concentrations in downstream waters. Previous regional assessments have found significant declines in stream macroinvertebrate and fish communities after draining these mined areas. Here, we expand these assessments with a more comprehensive evaluation across a broad range of organisms (bacteria, algae, macroinvertebrates, all eukaryotes, and fish) using high-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA). We collected water samples from 93 streams in Central Appalachia (West Virginia, United States) spanning a gradient of mountaintop coal mining intensity and legacy to assess how this land use alters downstream water chemistry and affects aquatic biodiversity. For each group of organisms, we identified the sensitive and tolerant taxa along the gradient and calculated stream specific conductivity thresholds in which large synchronous declines in diversity were observed. Streams below mining operations had steep declines in diversity (−18 to −41%) and substantial shifts in community composition that were consistent across multiple taxonomic groups. Overall, large synchronous declines in bacterial, algal, and macroinvertebrate communities occurred even at low levels of mining impact at stream specific conductivity thresholds of 150–200 µS/cm that are substantially below the current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency aquatic life benchmark of 300 µS/cm for Central Appalachian streams. We show that extensive coal surface mining activities led to the extirpation of 40% of biodiversity from impacted rivers throughout the region and that current water quality criteria are likely not protective for many groups of aquatic organisms. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract={Global biodiversity loss is occurring at an alarming rate, with a growing consensus that we are entering a sixth mass extinction. Rapid human development and associated habitat loss, principally through agriculture, infrastructure and extractive industries, is a significant contributor. The critically endangered western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) is at the nexus of the development-habitat loss conflict with 83% of the subspecies occurring outside protected areas. To protect its habitat, robust regulation of large-scale development, in particular through Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures that adequately incorporate the Mitigation Hierarchy Principles (MHPs), is required. We developed a framework to review EIA and related legislation in all eight western chimpanzee range countries and assessed how well they incorporate MHPs, focusing specifically on mining activity. Costa Rica was selected as a benchmark of good practice, based on the recognised quality of its biodiversity laws. Overall performance of the eight countries fell substantially below that of Costa Rica. Whilst isolated good examples were identified, the overall approach legislates for broad concepts but fails to deliver on detailed provisions. As recommended by the current regional action plan for the conservation of western chimpanzees, all countries would benefit from urgent legislative reform to better incorporate MHPs within EIA procedures. This study provides recommendations in that regard together with a replicable tool for assessing EIA legislation in other jurisdictions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Southeast Asia has arguably the highest biodiversity loss due to the high deforestation rate and hunting pressure. In the region, 55 species of the family Phasianidae can be found in all available land habitats from lowland plains up to high-elevation mountainous areas. As ground-dwelling birds, these species are sensitive to habitat disturbance and hunting pressure, making them ideal to evaluate the status of remaining Southeast Asian forest habitats. The aims of this work are, therefore, to define for each Phasianidae species: (1) the extent of forest cover, suitable habitat and large forest patches currently available in the region and their decline over the years between 2000 and 2018 (six estimated generations) and (2) assess the threats using a Bayesian Belief Network approach combining data on forest loss hotspots and hunting pressure. Moreover, we defined the spatial distribution of Phasianidae diversity hotspots and relative threats in the region. The results show that over the 18-year study period, the forest cover, suitable habitat and Phasianidae diversity in Southeast Asia declined overall. The remaining forest habitats currently have low species diversity and face medium to high threat levels from habitat loss and hunting pressure. Population monitoring and higher protection levels both inside and outside protected areas are essential for the species’ long term survival. We recommend using Phasianidae as indicator species to monitor the overall habitat conservation status in Southeast Asia. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Human-induced environmental changes are accelerating biodiversity loss. Identifying which life-history traits increase extinction risk is important to inform proactive conservation. While geographically or numerically rare species are typically more vulnerable, ecological specialization may also increase extinction risk particularly when associated with rarity. We investigate whether regionally endemic freshwater fishes have more specialized diets and habitat requirements than more widely distributed, closely related species. We then use this information to assess extinction risk. Using closely-related widespread and endemic congeneric pairings from the Kimberley region of north-western Australia, we investigate whether there are ontogenetic diet shifts in 13 species and if some of these ontogenetic trophic units (OTUs) have narrow dietary niches. Using qualitative measures of habitat and presence/absence data, we also assess habitat specialization in 32 species. Overall, range-restricted species had narrower ecological niches. Ontogenetic diet shifts existed in 12 of 13 species and range-restricted species were more specialized for some or all of their OTUs compared to their widespread congenerics. Endemic species had a higher degree of variance in habitat use compared to their widespread congenerics, showing they had more specialized habitat requirements. As specialization is linked to extinction risk, the narrow niche breadth of small-ranged endemic fishes makes them more vulnerable to extinction than more cosmopolitan species. As many endemics from the Kimberley region have small ranges and/or low abundances, they may have an increased risk of extinction. By identifying which endemic species have narrow ecological niches, our study provides essential information for targeting proactive conservation efforts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Biodiversity across the Neotropics is a result of selective forces along a myriad of ecosystems. The Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome embodies 321 mammal species; only a small parcel of the species is considered piscivore. The Atlantic Forest biota is threatened by multiple factors, from habitat loss to climate changes. We aimed to understand the current distribution of the six extant piscivore mammals and the distribution of this trophic guild, predicting their distribution under climate change across the Atlantic Forest and identifying areas for the trophic guild conservation prioritizations. We used data on species occurrence based on the GBIF database and literature, and climatic data from WorldClim. We perform Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) to derive the piscivores distribution and the presence of this trophic guild. Our results reveal that piscivores distribution is already restricted in the present (average 8.84%), even the presence of this trophic guild (6.42%). Trophic guild distribution in the short-term under climate change may represent less than 6.5% across the Atlantic Forest, will be contracting by −30.0%. We conclude that combinations of factors inductors of biodiversity loss will be empowered by climate changes, leading to more restricted species distribution. SDM is fundamental to understand the species distribution to prioritize conservation efforts from local to pan-continental scales, being paramount to slow down the consequences of climate change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Agricultural intensification can decrease biodiversity and ecosystem services they deliver to agroecosystems. Diverse trees-shaded coffee is structurally and functionally complex and has biodiversity adequate for sustainable production of coffee and mitigation of biodiversity loss due to deforestation. However, shade tree simplification is intense in coffee agroforests worldwide, threatening their economic and environmental targets. In south India, native trees have been replaced by silver oak (Grevillea robusta) trees. Native trees-shaded coffee is floristically complex and diverse than oak-shaded coffee. We hypothesize that the natural prey removal fares better in native trees-shaded coffee than in oak-shaded coffee. Artificial caterpillar models of three colors were installed rotationally on leaves, stems, and branches of coffee plants in native trees-shaded- and oak-shaded coffee, and assessed the predation rates for fruiting and leaf-flushing periods of coffee to test this. Forty-four percent of the caterpillars were predated. Arthropods, and in particular the ants, were the predominant predators. Lizards followed by birds, and mammals were second, third, and fourth important predators of coffee agroforests. Overall, predation rates did not differ with the shade diversity, but lizard predation rates were higher in diverse trees-shaded coffee than in oak-shaded coffee. The predation rates were slightly higher in the fruiting season of coffee. Predation rates of any predator taxa were higher for the caterpillars placed on stems and branches than on leaves. The study does not support the hypothesis that the natural predation rates might be higher in floristically complex coffee agroforests, but highlights the biocontrol potential of lizards in diverse-shaded coffee. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The emergence of secondary forests in deforested tropical regions represents an opportunity to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change, but there is still debate on how fast and to which level these forests can recover biodiversity. Recent studies have shown that the recovery of plant and vertebrate species richness is relatively fast, but the pace of recovery for other groups remains unclear. Soil macroinvertebrates play critical roles on litter decomposition and seed dispersal, therefore the pace of their recovery has consequences for the entire forest ecosystem. We investigated how fast broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna recover in the first 30 years of forest regeneration using forests older than 50 years as reference. We surveyed the number, diversity and abundance of 19 broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna in 85 sites located in Brazilian Amazon, covering forests of different ages and clearing frequencies. Forest age and clearing frequency were obtained accurately from Landsat images in forests up to 30 years old. We used regression analysis to determine (a) the effects forest age and clearing frequency on macrofauna groups in secondary forests up to 30 years old; and (b) the changes in macrofauna groups between young forests (up to 10 years old), median age forests (between 10 and 30 years old) and forests older than 50 years. We found that the number and diversity of macrofauna groups recover rapidly in the first 10 years of forest regrowth, but show slower change among older forests. This rapid recovery was also observed in the abundance of several taxonomic groups and for predators and detritivores as functional groups. Forest clearing frequency had no effect on the number or the diversity of macrofauna groups, but the abundance of ants increased as forest was cleared more often. Our results for soil macrofauna align with those in plant and vertebrate studies showing that secondary forests quickly recover a large part of their biodiversity and ecological functions. Therefore, global-scale conservation strategies are needed to ensure the opportunity for secondary forests to grow. ​. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The South China Sea is an important oceanic habitat for endangered sea turtles, which are facing anthropogenic pressures from the illegal wildlife trade, fisheries by-catch, debris pollution, habitat loss, and climate change. Compounding these threats are international disputes over territorial claims in the South China Sea, exerting a general disinclination toward regional collaborations to solve environmental issues. Since sea turtles are migratory animals that move through aquatic and terrestrial habitats, feeding in waters, and nesting on beaches under the jurisdiction of multiple countries, the species is an ideal ambassador to raise public support for international collaborations. Transnational communications to coordinate conservation efforts across borders provide a positive agenda of cooperation to build trust, creating a politically neutral platform to facilitate opportunities for diplomacy to reset and improve foreign relations, underscoring the value of sea turtles as a flagship species to reduce international tensions and bring nations together. For this reason, the U.S.-China EcoPartnership between Sea Turtles 911 and Hainan Normal University was formed to empower local communities to protect the ocean through sea turtle rescue, public education, and scientific research projects. Genetic research determined the geographic origins of illegally traded sea turtles, validating the uniqueness of the Paracel (Xisha) Islands rookery, and urging policymakers to establish a large-scale sea turtle nature reserve in the South China Sea. To define boundaries of the proposed marine protected area, sea turtles were tracked with satellite telemetry delineating their migratory routes and habitats across multiple countries, underscoring the importance of international collaborations. Debris pollution survey at a major turtle nesting beach in the Paracel Islands demonstrated that pollution is negatively impacting newborn turtle hatchlings and that regional cooperation in the South China Sea should promote the reduction and cleanup of marine debris. Laparoscopic surgery was performed on sea turtles for the first time in China to assess the gender ratio of the local population, which revealed a female biased ratio, indicative of the effects of climate change. A sea turtle rescue center was jointly established in which more than 100 sea turtles were successfully rescued and released by the international and local community, including students who won national awards for their volunteer service. Implementing grassroots initiatives for sea turtle conservation have become an ideal diplomatic channel to strengthen U.S.-China relations as several diplomats, including U.S. Ambassador Max Baucus, have engaged in people-to-people exchanges during public educational events. This international partnership serves as a case example in which current political disputes can be set aside to prepare future generations for the existential threat of biodiversity loss and climate change, while increasing peace, stability, and turtles in the region. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers},

abstract={In mining areas, habitat rehabilitation is increasingly being used to minimise biodiversity loss and restore areas of natural habitat. In some mining areas, both exotic and native tree species are used in rehabilitation. For the most part, the effectiveness of using both native and exotic plant species in rehabilitation to attract avifauna is not known. Using a fixed-radius point-count method to sample birds, this study assessed the extent to which sites rehabilitated with exotic plant species attracted local avifauna compared to sites rehabilitated with native plant species, as well as to the unaffected surrounding woodlands. Rehabilitation dominated by exotic species had a lower density of bird species and individuals, lower relative abundance and lower species diversity compared with sites rehabilitated by native plant species and the surrounding woodlands. The results suggest that the use of exotic plant species, L. leucocephala, should be avoided in rehabilitation. Therefore, for restoration purposes it is desirable to use native tree species in rehabilitation rather than exotic tree species. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Many migratory birds are declining worldwide. In line with the general causes for the global biodiversity crisis, habitat loss, pollution, hunting, over-exploitation and climate change are thought to be at the basis of these population declines. Long-distance migrants seem especially vulnerable to rapid anthropogenic change, yet, the rate of decline across populations and species varies greatly within flyways. We hypothesize that differences in migration strategy, and notably stopover-site use, may be at the basis of these variations in resilience to global change. By identifying and comparing the migration strategies of two very closely related shorebird species, the Curlew sandpiper Calidris ferruginea and the Red-necked stint Calidris ruficollis, migrating from the same non-breeding site in Australia to similar breeding sites in the high Russian Arctic, we aimed to explain why these two species express differential resilience to rapid changes within their flyway resulting in different population trajectories in recent times. Based on 13 Curlew sandpiper and 16 Red-necked stint tracks from light-level geolocator tags, we found that individual Curlew sandpipers make use of fewer stopover areas along the flyway compared to Red-necked stints. Furthermore, and notably during northward migration, Curlew sandpipers have a higher dependency on fewer sites, both in terms of the percentage of individuals visiting key stopover sites and the relative time spent at those sites. While Curlew sandpipers rely mainly on the Yellow Sea region, which has recently experienced a sharp decline in suitable habitat, Red-necked stints make use of additional sites and spread their relative time en-route across sites more evenly. Our results indicate that differential migration strategies may explain why Curlew sandpipers within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway are declining rapidly (9.5%–5.5% per year) while Red-necked stints remain relatively stable (−3.1%–0%). We consider that more generally, the number of sites per individual and among a population, the spatial distribution across the flyway, as well as the relationship between the time spent over sites may prove to be key variables explaining populations and species' differential resilience to environmental change. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={As biodiversity loss accelerates globally, understanding environmental influence over biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships becomes crucial for ecosystem management. Theory suggests that resource supply affects the shape of BEF relationships, but this awaits detailed investigation in marine ecosystems. Here, we use deep-sea chemosynthetic methane seeps and surrounding sediments as natural laboratories in which to contrast relationships between BEF proxies along with a gradient of trophic resource availability (higher resource methane seep, to lower resource photosynthetically fuelled deep-sea habitats). We determined sediment fauna taxonomic and functional trait biodiversity, and quantified bioturbation potential (BPc), calcification degree, standing stock and density as ecosystem functioning proxies. Relationships were strongly unimodal in chemosynthetic seep habitats, but were undetectable in transitional 'chemotone' habitats and photosynthetically dependent deep-sea habitats. In seep habitats, ecosystem functioning proxies peaked below maximum biodiversity, perhaps suggesting that a small number of specialized species are important in shaping this relationship. This suggests that absolute biodiversity is not a good metric of ecosystem 'value' at methane seeps, and that these deep-sea environments may require special management to maintain ecosystem functioning under human disturbance. We promote further investigation of BEF relationships in non-traditional resource environments and emphasize that deep-sea conservation should consider 'functioning hotspots' alongside biodiversity hotspots. © 2021 The Authors.},

abstract={One of the biggest challenges to deal with the global crisis of biodiversity loss is the lack of efficient and viable monitoring systems across scales. Unlike traditional in situ biodiversity monitoring, a usually costly and time-consuming enterprise, satellite remote sensing (SRS) data offer a technically feasible and sustainable in time solution. Here, we devise a cost-effective and upgradeable spatiotemporal framework for monitoring the species-specific habitat availability changes across scales by trend analysis of habitat suitability index (HSI) derived from ecological niche models (ENMs; Maxent) and using time series of SRS data (MODIS). The SRS-ENM framework was applied for a large suite of native species (911), from major taxonomic groups (flora (vascular plants), amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals), and listed in the IUCN Red List at regional (Iberian Peninsula) and continental (Europe) scales. The HSI-trend analyses predict cumulative reductions in habitat suitability for Threatened and Non-Threatened species across scales for the period 2002–2016. Specifically, 19% and 66% of the total grid cells for both species' groups showed negative trends at both regional and continental scales, respectively. Results were similar when considering all IUCN threat categories. All taxa groups showed a decrease in habitat suitability, but amphibians and reptiles groups hosted the largest number of negative HSI-trends grid cells. Considering all groups together, 12% and 34% of both study areas have strong reductions in habitat quality. We conclude that our framework detects increases and decreases in species' habitat suitability regardless of the spatial scale, extent, and pixel size. Species' range predictions across space and time based on SRS time series represent a promising Earth observation tool to support traditional risk assessment protocols and anticipate the decision-making process, while serving as a cross-scale biodiversity monitoring system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Recent studies have drawn contrasting conclusions about the extent to which local-scale measures of biodiversity are declining and whether such patterns conflict with the global-scale declines that have attracted much attention.1 A key source of high-quality data for such analyses comes from longitudinal biodiversity studies, which sample a given taxon repeatedly over time at a specific location.2 There has been relatively little consideration of how habitat change might lead to biases in the sampling and continuity of biodiversity time series data, and the consequent potential for bias in the biodiversity trends that result. Here, based on analysis of standardized routes from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (3,014 routes sampled over 18 years),3 we demonstrate that major local habitat change is associated with an increase in the rate of survey cessations. We further show that routes that were continued despite major habitat changes show reduced diversity. By simulating potential rates of loss, we show that the underlying real trends in taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity can even reverse in sign if more than a quarter of diversity is lost from routes that ceased and are thus no longer included in surveys. Our analyses imply that biodiversity loss can be underestimated by biases introduced if continued sampling in longitudinal studies is influenced by local change. We argue that researchers and conservation practitioners should be aware of the potential for bias in such data and seek to use more robust methods to evaluate biodiversity trends and make conservation decisions. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Marine biodiversity loss is a global threat for the integrity of ecosystem services. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are commonly used for biodiversity conservation to displace anthropogenic threats, but by doing so they can impact coastal community livelihoods. They are often assumed to confer added cultural ecosystem services (CESs) to affected communities, offering new economic opportunities, but we currently lack a global estimate of MPA CES provision. Here, we used a paired design to compare the intensity with which CESs from all MPAs worldwide and adjacent control areas were utilized over the past 10 years by using geo-referenced Flickr photos and their user-generated descriptions. Globally, more photos were posted, by more users, in MPAs. Flickr users mentioned nature and wildlife topics more in MPAs. MPA photos were described more positively and were more popular. We conclude that users preferentially visited MPAs to experience nature and wildlife. Globally, MPAs deliver added CESs. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Hydroelectric dams represent an emergent threat to lowland tropical forest biodiversity. Despite the large number of operational, under-construction, and planned hydroelectric dams, their long-term effects on biodiversity loss are still poorly documented. Here, we investigate avian extinctions resulting from the Tucuruí Hydroelectric Reservoir (THR), the oldest Amazonian mega dam, which impounded the Tocantins River in 1984. Our avian inventory—based on several sampling methods (mist-netting, point-counts, boat census and qualitative surveys) during 280 days of fieldwork from 2005 to 2007—was combined with an exhaustive search of museum vouchers and digital online databases of citizen science from the lower Tocantins River to identify long-term trends in species persistence and extinction in the THR influence area. The regional avifauna was comprised of 479 species, 404 of which were recorded during our fieldwork. Based on recent and historical records spanning 172 years, we found evidence for likely extinctions at THR influence area for 53 (11.06%) species that have remained entirely unreported since 1984. We were further able to estimate extinction probabilities for 20 species; 15 species were considered to be extinct, including Psophia interjecta and Pyrilia vulturina that are red-listed by IUCN. Our study serves as a baseline for avifaunal monitoring in the THR influence area and shows that degree of habitat specialization is a key factor in determining species extinctions caused by nonrandom habitat loss from either inundation or deforestation. Avian species extinctions will most likely continue across the area affected by the reservoir as a direct impact of alluvial forest loss and ongoing habitat degradation of upland forests. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

abstract={Freshwater biodiversity loss exceeds that in terrestrial systems; fishes are a predominant indicator of this catastrophe. Current worldwide estimates of freshwater fish species threatened with extinction are about 30%. We discuss why standard monitoring of the status of most fishes is inadequate to keep up with declines. Rapid population declines and shrinking freshwater fish distributions result in shifting baselines that make it challenging to evaluate conservation status reliably and promptly and effectively address further decreases. We present the California Method for Status Evaluation of Fishes as an alternative to existing methods for assessing the regional status of freshwater fishes. This method uses local expertise to score metrics and generates a fish status rating to inform short-term management decisions. This approach applies to Distinct Population Segments, subspecies, species, and entire regional fish faunas and is adaptable to local, changing environmental conditions. Using this method, we update the freshwater status scores for 131 native California fish species, a fauna in rapid decline. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={As the biodiversity crisis continues, we must redouble efforts to understand and curb pressures pushing species closer to extinction. One major driver is the unsustainable trade of wildlife. Trade in internationally regulated species gains the most research attention, but this only accounts for a minority of traded species and we risk failing to appreciate the scale and impacts of unregulated legal trade. Despite being legal, trade puts pressure on wild species via: Direct collection, introduced pathogens, and invasive species. Smaller species-rich vertebrates, such reptiles, fish, and amphibians, may be particularly vulnerable to trading because of gaps in regulations, small distributions, and demand of novel species. Here we combine data from five sources: Online web searches in six languages, CITES trade database, LEMIS trade inventory, IUCN assessments, and a recent literature review, to characterise the global trade in amphibians, and also map use by purpose including meat, pets, medicinal and for research. We show that 1,215 species are being traded (17% of amphibian species), almost three times previous recorded numbers, 345 are threatened, and 100 data deficient or unassessed. Traded species origin hotspots include South American, China, and Central Africa; sources indicate 42% of amphibians are taken from the wild. Newly described species can be rapidly traded (mean time lag of 6.5 years), including threatened and unassessed species. The scale and limited regulation of the amphibian trade, paired with the triptych of connected pressures (collection, pathogens, invasive species), warrants a re-examination of the wildlife trade status-quo, application of the precautionary principle in regards to wildlife trade, and a renewed push to achieve global biodiversity goals. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

abstract={Biological invasions are a leading driver of biodiversity loss and population declines worldwide. While much research has focused on understanding the effects of long-distance (e.g., cross-continental) invasion, the potential impacts of species that invade close to or within their native ranges are relatively understudied. We investigated the effects of the near-range introduction of a non-native plant, New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana), on riparian plant and bird communities in northwestern Colorado, USA. By surveying plant and bird communities and examining nest success and productivity in riparian forest with and without locust, we evaluated the following ecological responses to invasion: (1) tree and shrub richness and density; (2) bird species richness, occupancy, and abundance; and (3) avian reproductive success. Our results demonstrate biotic homogenization of the plant community with increasing intensity of locust invasion, yet we found little evidence for negative effects on avian habitat use or reproductive success. Instead, locust invasion showed a positive effect on nest productivity, with significantly higher brood sizes and numbers of young fledged for nests in invaded habitats compared to those where locust was absent. Because climate change is already leading to shifts in species distribution patterns, we suggest that understanding the ecological consequences of plant invasions that occur within or near historic ranges will advance the science and practice of invasive species biology in a changing world. Our findings of mostly neutral to positive effects of locust suggest that near-range plant invasions may not always negatively impact community structure. LAY SUMMARY Near-range introductions occur when species are brought to areas close to their native ranges. Though much less studied than traditional long-distance invasions, they have the potential to transform native plant and animal communities. New Mexico locust, a fast-growing woody plant, was introduced to a valley in Colorado, USA, near its northern range boundary. We collected data on plants and birds in areas with and without locust and found that locust decreased the diversity of plant species but had neutral to positive impacts on the bird community. Nests located in areas with locust produced more nestlings than those in uninvaded sites, suggesting locust may provide benefits for some songbirds, potentially in the form of enhanced nest protection and/or food availability. Near-range introductions are likely to become more common with climate change; our results suggest these introductions may have mixed effects on plant and animal communities. © American Ornithological Society 2021.},

abstract={Honeybee and general pollinator decline is extensively reported in many countries, adding new concern to the general biodiversity loss. Many studies were addressed to assess the causes of pollinator decline, concluding that in most cases multi-stress effects were the most probable ones. In this research, the combined effects of two possible stress sources for bees, pesticides and electromagnetic fields (multi-stress conditions), were analyzed in the field. Three experimental sites were chosen: a control one far from direct anthropogenic stress sources, a pesticide-stress site and multi-stress one, adding to the same exposure to pesticides the presence of an electromagnetic field, coming from a high-voltage electric line. Experimental apiaries were monitored weekly for one year (from April 2017 to April 2018) by means of colony survival, queen activity, storage and brood amount, parasites and pathogens, and several biomarkers in young workers and pupae. Both exposure and effect biomarkers were analysed: among the first, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS); and among the last, DNA fragmentation (DNAFRAGM) and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Results showed that bee health conditions were the worst in the multi-stress site with only one colony alive out of the four ones present at the beginning. In this site, a complex picture of adverse effects was observed, such as disease appearance (American foulbrood), higher mortality in the underbaskets (common to pesticide-stress site), behavioral alterations (queen changes, excess of honey storage) and biochemical anomalies (higher ALP activity at the end of the season). The overall results clearly indicate that the multi-stress conditions were able to induce biochemical, physiological and behavioral alterations which severely threatened bee colony survival. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Unabated urbanization has led to environmental degradation and subsequent biodiversity loss across the globe. As an outcome of unmitigated land use, multi‐jurisdictional agencies have developed land use plans that attempt to protect threatened or endangered species across selected areas by which some trade‐offs between harm to species and additional conservation approaches are allowed among the partnering organizations. Typical conservation plans can be created to focus on single or multiple species, and although they may protect a species or groups of species, they may not account for biodiversity or its protection across the given area. We applied an approach that clustered deductive habitat models for terrestrial vertebrates into metrics that serve as surrogates for biodiversity and relate to ecosystem services. In order to evaluate this process, we collab-orated with the partnering agencies who are creating a Multi‐Species Habitat Conservation Plan in southern California and compared it to the entire Mojave Desert Ecoregion. We focused on total terrestrial vertebrate species richness and taxon groupings representing amphibians, birds, mam-mals, and reptiles, and two special status species using the Normalized Index of Biodiversity (NIB). The conservation planning area had a lower NIB and was less species rich than the Mojave Desert Ecoregion, but the Mojave River riparian corridor had a higher NIB and was more species‐rich, and while taxon analysis varied across the geographies, this pattern generally held. Additionally, we analyzed desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) and desert kit fox (Vulpes macrotis arsipus) as umbrella species and determined that both species are associated with increased NIB and large numbers of species for the conservation area. Our process provided the ability to incorporate value‐added surrogate information into a formal land use planning process and used a metric, NIB, which allowed comparison of the various planning areas and geographic units. Although this process has been applied to Apple Valley, CA, and other geographies within the U.S., the approach has practical application for other global biodiversity initiatives. macroeconomic and industry statistics, wildlife economics related to food, materials, rec-reation, and cultural and aesthetic goods and activities are generally comparable to the activity generated by traditional economic sectors such as agriculture, oil and gas, utilities, and computer and electronics. This BEA effort did not include aesthetic values such as wildlife art, festivals, museum visitation, photography, film, magazines, and television [23]. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Grassland systems constitute a significant portion of the land area in the United States and as a result harbors significant arthropod biodiversity. During this time of biodiversity loss around the world, bioinventories of ecologically important habitats serve as important indicators for the effectiveness of conservation efforts. We conducted a bioinventory of the foliar, soil, and dung arthropod communities in 10 cattle pastures located in the southeastern United States during the 2018 grazing season. In sum, 126,251 arthropod specimens were collected. From the foliar community, 13 arthropod orders were observed, with the greatest species richness found in Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera. The soil-dwelling arthropod community contained 18 orders. The three orders comprising the highest species richness were Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera. Lastly, 12 arthropod orders were collected from cattle dung, with the greatest species richness found in Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera. Herbivores were the most abundant functional guild found in the foliar community, and predators were most abundant in the soil and dung communities. Arthropod pests constituted a small portion of the pasture arthropod communities, with 1.01%, 0.34%, and 0.46% pests found in the foliar, soil, and dung communities, respectively. While bioinventories demand considerable time, energy, and resources to accomplish, the information from these inventories has many uses for conservation efforts, land management recommendations, and the direction of climate change science. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Biological invasions are important causes of biodiversity loss, particularly in remote islands. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) have been widely introduced throughout the Southern Hemisphere, impacting endangered native fauna, particularly galaxiid fishes, through predation and competition. However, due to their importance for sport fishing and aquaculture farming, attempts to curtail the impacts of invasive salmonids have generally been met with limited support and the best prospects for protecting native galaxiids is to predict where and how salmonids might disperse. We analysed 266 invasive brown trout from 14 rivers and ponds across the Falkland Islands as well as 32 trout from three potential source populations, using a panel of 592 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and acoustic tagging, to ascertain their origins and current patterns of dispersal. We identified four genetically distinct clusters with high levels of genetic diversity and low admixture, likely reflecting the different origins of the invasive brown trout populations. Our analysis suggests that many trout populations in the Falklands may have originated from one of the donor populations analysed (River Wey). The highest genetic diversity was observed in the rivers with the greatest number of introductions and diverse origins, while the lowest diversity corresponded to a location without documented introductions, likely colonized by natural dispersal. High levels of gene flow indicated widespread migration of brown trout across the Falkland Islands, likely aided by anadromous dispersal. This is supported by data from acoustically tagged fish, three of which were detected frequently moving between two rivers ~26 km apart. Our results suggest that, without containment measures, brown trout may invade the last remaining refuges for the native endangered Aplochiton spp. We provide new insights into the origin and dispersal of invasive brown trout in the Falkland Islands that can pave the way for a targeted approach to limit their impact on native fish fauna. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Abstract: The current biodiversity crisis calls for rapid and wide-ranging surveys to assess living organisms. However, some taxa are more elusive than others, making monitoring challenging. This is the case for soil invertebrates, but new molecular technologies such as eDNA metabarcoding could help to alleviate this problem. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using an eDNA approach to survey dung beetles, adapting existing monitoring methods for surveying dung fauna to enable eDNA collection in a non-destructive way. The main design idea is to capture species secretions and excretions from a serum-soaked nonwoven compress in a baited non-destructive trap. While the attractiveness of the device to dung beetles and the sampling protocol would benefit from further development, eDNA allowed the identification of more than 68% of trapped species and an identification of relative abundance match rate of 79%. The results of the study demonstrate the effectiveness of eDNA-based detection tools for the monitoring of dung beetles compared to standard surveying and identification techniques. Moreover, the adapted collecting device developed for the study could be used for similar surveys of other terrestrial invertebrates or even re-adapted. Ultimately, we hope this study encourages more non-invasive studies of insects by enabling others to utilize these emerging, non-destructive molecular techniques and therefore foster wide insect monitorings and conservation programs. Implications for insect conservation: Standardization and optimization of sampling protocols for inventorying and monitoring is key to unlock invertebrates’ studies and conservation evaluations. Here we show how molecular tools, such as eDNA, are a promising way to gather rapidly ecological information without killing targeted populations by adapting traditional inventory tools. Newly developed NDC traps for dung beetles, inspired by CSR traps, allowed qualitative and quantitative information gathering in temperate agropastoral ecosystems opening the way to large scale eDNA monitoring to inform management and conservation schemes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The Natura 2000 network of protected sites is the pillar of biodiversity conservation in Europe. Although the Natura 2000 network directly addresses birds, these have shown worrying declining trends. It is therefore crucial to assess the potential contribution of Natura 2000 conservation measures. In this paper, we use a replicable method to model bird trends in the period 2000–2015 and the effects of Natura 2000 protection, across land cover classes, on regional abundances and local species richness and diversity. We model bird trends in Veneto, a North-Eastern Italian Region with areas among the richest in bird species in Italy. Bird data were derived from the national breeding bird monitoring scheme. Breeding birds showed declining trends at the regional level, confirming national and continental trends, particularly on agricultural and natural areas. The land cover class, rather than Natura 2000, mostly influenced population trends; however, it was possible to observe slightly higher estimates of species richness and diversity in Natura 2000 sites. Despite the absolute higher estimates of richness and diversity over the investigated period, farmland and woodland bird species had steeper declining trends inside Natura 2000 than outside, matching the values of the areas outside the network at the end of the survey period. We conclude that the Natura 2000 network capacity to buffer biodiversity loss and act as a species-pool for non-protected areas is decreasing over time, mainly with regards to farmland and woodland birds. Natura 2000 implementation must be improved: conservation objectives and measures, management, and monitoring should be better integrated into existing plans and funding should be made more efficiently available for Natura 2000. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Southeast Asian tropical rainforests are shrinking at an alarming rate largely due to anthropogenic activities such as logging and agricultural expansion. The loss of tropical rainforests from human exploitations caused devastating and irreversible impacts on avian biodiversity. The establishment of protected areas is an effective tool to mitigate further forest biodiversity loss. However, the ability of degraded rainforest to support avian biodiversity is still remain little known. Here, we assessed bird assemblages in a hill dipterocarp forest in Peninsular Malaysia which was selectively logged almost three decades ago. We examined the effects of site-level attributes, particularly vegetation structure on bird community composition, species richness and abundance of selected feeding guild groups (i.e. insectivorous, carnivorous, and frugivorous). Generally, we found that a selectively logged hill dipterocarp forest can still support a large proportion of forest birds, including those species with high conservation values. Our data also revealed that avian biodiversity was positively related to the number of fallen snags, number of standing snags, number of shrubs, number of trees with DBH < 5 cm, and elevation. In contrast, avian biodiversity was negatively linked to canopy cover percentage, number of palms, and number of trees with DBH 30–50 cm. Our findings suggest the importance of post-harvest site-level attributes management in order to improve avian biodiversity in logged hill dipterocarp forests. Above all, urgent actions are needed to incorporate hill dipterocarp forests, including those already disturbed by logging into protected area networks in Peninsular Malaysia to mitigate forest biodiversity loss. © 2021},

Fourteen microsatellites were used to determine the genetic structure of red squirrel populations on the Isle of Wight, as well as their relatedness to other populations of the species. Our results demonstrated that squirrels on these islands were less genetically diverse than those in Continental mainland populations, as would be expected. It also confirmed previous results from mitochondrial DNA which indicated that the squirrels on the Isle of Wight were relatively closely related to Brownsea island squirrels in the south of England. Importantly, our findings showed that genetic mixing between squirrels in the east and west of the Isle of Wight was very limited. Given the potential deleterious effects of small population size on genetic health, landscape management to encourage dispersal of squirrels between these populations should be a priority. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Climate and land-use change are major drivers of biodiversity loss, but their combined effects are still unclear. Reforestation may compensate or reduce climate change impacts on species, but this hypothesis has not been tested yet. Here we quantify the additive and synergistic effects of forest change – in particular, reforestation – and climate changes on ten endemic and forest-dependent anurans of the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We estimated climatic and habitat suitability for all species under historical and future (2050) conditions, using niche modeling and forest cover maps from a comprehensive land-use model. We contrasted a pessimistic land-use scenario, with little change in forest cover, with an optimistic scenario, with forest gain through restoration of “legal reserve” areas. Our models show that climate change will have species-specific effects on anurans, increasing climatic suitability for seven species, but decreasing for three. For these three species, we predict that forest gain can compensate the negative impact of climate change, increasing overall environmental suitability. These results reinforce the importance of ensuring reforestation and forest protection as a climate change adaptation strategy for biodiversity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Urban environments are novel ecosystems, with increased chemical, sound, and light pollution differentially impacting many animals. Understanding the impacts of urban environments on biodiversity is the first step to understanding how to best mitigate biodiversity losses in an increasingly urbanizing world. Analyses with broad geographic and taxonomic coverage can offer critical context for informing urban biodiversity conservation. But such studies are currently lacking, especially for under-studied, but likely highly impacted, taxa such as frogs. Our objective was to document frog diversity in relation to urban environments at continental, regional, and local scales. We used FrogID data, ⁠an opportunistic citizen science dataset generated by volunteers recording calling frogs using a smartphone and validated by experts ⁠throughout continental Australia, to calculate species richness, Shannon diversity, and phylogenetic diversity of frogs in urban and non-urban areas, as well as along a continuous urbanization gradient. The overall species richness of frogs was, on average, 57% less in urban than non-urban areas across six ecoregions. Further, we found significantly lower frog diversity in urban environments compared with non-urban environments across the country, with an average reduction of 59% species richness, 86% Shannon diversity, and 72% phylogenetic diversity. We also found evidence for a steady decrease in frog diversity along an urbanization gradient, with no obvious thresholds. Our results highlight the negative impacts of urbanization, ⁠at a continental scale, ⁠on frog diversity, and clearly highlight the necessity to consider frog diversity in future urban land development decisions. © 2021 Gesellschaft für Ökologie},

abstract={Both the conservation of biodiversity and the maintenance of ecosystem services are important and fundamental goals in response to the current biodiversity crisis. Cultural ecosystem services – the non-material benefits people derive from their interactions with nature – are an important component of ecosystem services. However, determining the contributions of different components of biodiversity to these benefits has proven more challenging than for other ecosystem services. Here, we determine the relative contributions of diversity (measured as cultivar richness) and abundance (number of individuals) to the aesthetic value of flowering plant communities, using sunflowers as a model organism. We created grassland vegetation plots consisting of different numbers of sunflower cultivars and individuals, presented these treatments to people, and measured their aesthetic preferences (both self-reported and objective behavioural measures) towards them. We found that people's aesthetic preferences were unrelated to differences in the cultivar richness of the plots but increased substantially with the number of individuals. More importantly, these preference patterns did not differ with a participants’ nature orientation, ecological knowledge, or gender, suggesting the generality of the results. Our findings indicate that the abundance of wildlife can play a crucial role in shaping the cultural services provided by ecosystems. Researchers and policy-makers should therefore pay more attention to the role of abundance in maintaining ecosystem services. © 2021},

abstract={Urbanization is an important human-driven process that leads to biodiversity loss and alters the interactions between organisms, including disease transmission. Although urbanization affects both host and vector communities, the effects on vector-borne pathogens are still poorly understood. Here, we monitored variation in prevalence and richness of three common blood parasites in birds (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon) from localities with different land uses (urban, rural and natural) during two consecutive years (2013 and 2014). Overall, 1400 juvenile house sparrows (Passer domesticus) from 15 localities in southern Spain were included in this study. Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon prevalence was higher in 2013 than in 2014, particularly in urban and natural habitats for the case of Leucocytozoon. Prevalence was correlated between years for Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, independently of the habitat. Additionally, rural habitats harboured significantly higher Haemoproteus lineage richness compared to urban and natural habitats during 2014. Leucocytozoon lineage richness was negatively correlated between years in rural habitats but positively correlated in urban and natural habitats in comparison. Parasite lineages found in birds were homogeneously distributed along habitats and years and the common lineages prevalence were not influenced by them. Our results highlight different patterns of infection depending on the parasite genera probably related to the composition and density of vector communities. The specific reproductive environmental requirements of the different groups of vectors involved in the transmission may be affected by climatic conditions and landscape features. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Aim: Few bird extinctions on oceanic island have been attributed to competition with non-native species, even though it might be an overlooked driver of biodiversity loss. We evaluate the potential competition between native and non-native island bird species, identifying species and island characteristics that enhance it and may promote future extinctions. Location: Seventy-three (&gt;100 km2) oceanic islands worldwide. Methods: We compiled a species list for each island and used single-trait meta-analyses to assess differences between native and non-native species. Then, we used single-trait beta regression models to identify species traits linked to potential competition. Finally, we used a trait-based approach to calculate the potential competition between native and non-native species on each island and identify island characteristics linked to potential competition. Results: Native bird species tended to be smaller forest dwellers, that were either carnivore, frugivore or insectivore, and that foraged in flight, in the canopy or at mid-height. In contrast, non-native birds tended to be open habitat granivores, that were either ground or unspecialized foragers. Potential competition tended to be higher for native species with typical non-native traits and forest-dwelling unspecialized non-native species. Potential competition between native and non-native birds was consistently higher in islands that were larger, had more non-native birds or were drier. Main conclusions: Niche differentiation of native and non-native species may explain the scarcity of reported competition-driven extinctions since non-natives clearly tend to favour and are better adapted to anthropogenic environments. However, the few non-native birds that occur in native ecosystems may be problematic. The loss of native ecosystems coupled with the introduction of species that might outcompete native species may enhance the relevance of competition in future island extinctions. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Marine reserves are a key tool for the conservation of marine biodiversity, yet only ~2.5% of the world's oceans are protected. The integration of marine reserves into connected networks representing all habitats has been encouraged by international agreements, yet the benefits of this design has not been tested empirically. Australia has one of the largest systems of marine reserves, providing a rare opportunity to assess how connectivity influences conservation success. An Australia-wide dataset was collected using baited remote underwater video systems deployed across a depth range from 0 to 100 m to assess the effectiveness of marine reserves for protecting teleosts subject to commercial and recreational fishing. A meta-analytical comparison of 73 fished species within 91 marine reserves found that, on average, marine reserves had 28% greater abundance and 53% greater biomass of fished species compared to adjacent areas open to fishing. However, benefits of protection were not observed across all reserves (heterogeneity), so full subsets generalized additive modelling was used to consider factors that influence marine reserve effectiveness, including distance-based and ecological metrics of connectivity among reserves. Our results suggest that increased connectivity and depth improve the aforementioned marine reserve benefits and that these factors should be considered to optimize such benefits over time. We provide important guidance on factors to consider when implementing marine reserves for the purpose of increasing the abundance and size of fished species, given the expected increase in coverage globally. We show that marine reserves that are highly protected (no-take) and designed to optimize connectivity, size and depth range can provide an effective conservation strategy for fished species in temperate and tropical waters within an overarching marine biodiversity conservation framework. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The purpose of the study was to evaluate the use of and suggest possible adjustments to indicators of biodiversity loss for LCA proposed by Chaudhary and Books (2018). For this, we analyzed soybean production in Brazil. Potential damage to biodiversity has been determined for all Brazilian ecoregions: the Amazon; the Atlantic forest; Caatinga; Cerrado; Pampas; and the Pantanal. Two dimensions of assessment were considered – global and regional – in addition to Average-country. An adjustment was proposed for the vulnerability coefficient to the indicators Average-country Brazil: the Regional Species Fragility Index (FI). Two inventories were created using two different functional units: area of production of soybean by ecoregion (year m2); and area corresponding to production of 1 kg of soybean (year m2). Thus, we observed that when the indicators of aggregate values were adopted, the Atlantic Forest was the ecoregion most affected by the crop. Regarding the assessments of the Potential Biodiversity Damage (BD) Global and Regional indicators, the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon were the ecoregions that suffered the highest impacts, mainly on plants, birds and amphibians taxa. Besides, the impacts at the global level were always more expressive than the regional ones. Due to this, we noticed that the results were influenced by the Vulnerability Score (VS). The suitability of the VS for FI is relevant and the adjustment in the equation can be suggested for other regions. Considering the results found here, to prevent regional impacts, technical measures such as extensive farming and crop rotation should be prioritized as impact mitigation actions. However, political measures tend to be more effective at geographic levels when addressing more than one ecoregion, due to the standardization of preservation procedures. Thus, from the results reported here, we conclude that the FI is relevant to diagnose measures at the administrative geographic levels of the ecoregions present in a single country, and the applied indicators reinforce that the Atlantic Forest ecoregion is the most vulnerable due to the replacement of wild forest for cultivated areas, which includes soybean crops. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={With abundant resources in the wetland, the Yellow River Delta provides important habitats for various kinds of rare bird species. However, due to climate change and human water withdrawal activities, no-flow events of the Yellow River occurred frequently since the 1970s, resulting in serious wetland degradation and biodiversity losses. Ecological water supplement has been regarded as one of the most effective measures to cope with these environmental problems. Accordingly, how much water is required for the ecological restoration becomes an essential question to be answered. Since the primary function of the Yellow River Delta Natural Reserve (YRDNR), the typical wetland in the Yellow River Delta, is to provide suitable habitats for various rare birds, the purpose of this paper is to propose a method based on water balance analysis to specify monthly ecological water supplement for the habitats of typical birds in the YRDNR. Specifically, three typical birds were selected as the protection objects, including Grus japonensis, Ciconia boyciana, and Larus saundersi. Monthly water supplement was determined by monthly long-term time series data (2003–2018) of evapotranspiration product derived from remote sensing and meteorological data (precipitation and pan evaporation) acquired from National Meteorological Information Center. The results showed that the annual ecological water supplement for 10 km2 ideal habitats was 666.17×104 m3, 1165.22×104 m3, and 664.48×104 m3 for G. japonensis, C. boyciana, and L. saundersi, respectively. Besides, it was found that annual precipitation generally had a significant negative relation with annual ecological water supplement, which suggested that local precipitation should be considered as a key factor in determining the amount of annual water supplement. The frequency analysis was then implemented to provide reasonable scheme of actual ecological water supplement under different precipitation scenarios. The results indicated that annual ecological water supplement for the whole YRDNR was 1.81×108 m3, 1.94×108 m3, 2.10×108 m3 and 2.25×108 m3 respectively under wet, average, dry and extreme dry conditions. If water storage measurements are implemented to store surplus precipitation under rainy season, the average volume would reduce by nearly 10%. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Context: While land use change is the main driver of biodiversity loss, most biodiversity assessments either ignore it or use a simple land cover representation. Land cover representations lack the representation of land use and landscape characteristics relevant to biodiversity modeling. Objectives: We developed a comprehensive and high-resolution representation of European land systems on a 1-km2 grid integrating important land use and landscape characteristics. Methods: Combining the recent data on land cover and land use intensities, we applied an expert-based hierarchical classification approach and identified land systems that are common in Europe and meaningful for studying biodiversity. We tested the benefits of using this map as compared to land cover information to predict the distribution of bird species having different vulnerability to landscape and land use change. Results: Next to landscapes dominated by one land cover, mosaic landscapes cover 14.5% of European terrestrial surface. When using the land system map, species distribution models demonstrate substantially higher predictive ability (up to 19% higher) as compared to models based on land cover maps. Our map consistently contributes more to the spatial distribution of the tested species than the use of land cover data (3.9 to 39.1% higher). Conclusions: A land systems classification including essential aspects of landscape and land management into a consistent classification can improve upon traditional land cover maps in large-scale biodiversity assessment. The classification balances data availability at continental scale with vital information needs for various ecological studies. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Establishing protected areas (PAs) is an essential strategy to reduce biodiversity loss. However, many PAs do not provide adequate protection due to poor funding, inadequate staffing and equipment, and ineffective management. As part of China's recent economic growth, the Chinese government has significantly increased investment in nature reserves over the past 20 years, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate whether PAs can protect threatened species effectively. We compiled data from published literature on populations of gibbons (Hylobatidae), a threatened taxon with cultural significance, that occurred in Chinese reserves after 1980. We evaluated the ability of these PAs to maintain gibbon habitat and populations by comparing forest cover and human disturbance between reserves and their surrounding areas and modeling the impact of reserve characteristics on gibbon population trends. We also assessed the perspective of reserve staff concerning PA management effectiveness through an online survey. Reserves effectively protected gibbon habitat by reducing forest loss and human disturbance; however, half the reserves lost their gibbon populations since being established. Gibbons were more likely to survive in reserves established more recently, at higher elevation, with less forest loss and lower human impact, and that have been relatively well studied. A larger initial population size in the 1980s was positively associated with gibbon persistence. Although staff of all reserves reported increased investment and improved management over the past 20–30 years, no relationship was found between management effectiveness and gibbon population trends. We suggest early and emphatic intervention is critical to stop population decline and prevent extinction. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={The recently emerged fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) causes the lethal skin disease chytridiomycosis in susceptible salamander species and is predicted to emerge within the Americas with devastating consequences. Host responses to Bsal are variable but the factors underlying these differences are unknown. To investigate the role of skin-associated immune defenses against Bsal and the closely related, B. dendrobatidis (Bd), we sampled skin peptides from wild and captive North American salamanders (spotted salamanders [Ambystoma maculatum], n = 10; hellbenders [Cryptobranchus alleganiensis], n = 2; red-legged salamanders [Plethodon shermani], n = 18; and Ocoee salamanders [Desmognathus ocoee], n = 15) and conducted in vitro experimental assays to test whether salamander skin peptides inhibit chytrid growth. Interspecies differences in skin defenses against Bsal and Bd, and peptide mixtures were also assessed using a standardized measure and RP-HPLC, respectively. For A. maculatum, skin peptides inhibited Bsal and Bd growth, consistent with known Bsal resistance. Cryptobranchus alleganiensis skin peptides inhibited the growth of Bsal but not Bd. Plethodon shermani and D. ocoee skin peptides facilitated Bsal growth and had either no effect or inconsistent effects on Bd growth. With the exception of A. maculatum, most species had relatively weak skin defenses against both chytrid pathogens. Collectively, we demonstrate that salamander skin peptide defenses against chytrid pathogens are highly variable and not always equally effective against Bsal and Bd. By advancing knowledge about the factors underlying chytrid susceptibility, particularly Bsal, our findings will help inform conservation initiatives aimed at reducing disease impacts and biodiversity loss. © 2021 The Zoological Society of London},

abstract={Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production industry globally and is considered to have the greatest potential to meet the growing demand for seafood and being a solution to overfishing. Despite the benefits of aquaculture, the rapid growth and intensification of production (so-called conventional aquaculture) has raised concerns about food safety, fish welfare, and environmental and social issues stemming from a tragedy of the commons. These concerns need to be addressed to enable sustainable aquaculture development. While the negative environmental impacts of aquaculture have been evaluated using physical and chemical indicators, the social acceptance has not been fully considered when evaluating aquaculture sustainability. With this backdrop, our study investigates knowledge and beliefs towards shrimp aquaculture development among two key stakeholder groups in Vietnam: the public and producers (shrimp farmers). Our results show that stakeholders were concerned about the social and environmental impacts of conventional shrimp aquaculture, although the different stakeholder groups emphasized different aspects. The public believed biodiversity loss and the overuse of antibiotics and pesticides to be more problematic compared to producers, who believed water quality and disease outbreaks were the main problems facing the industry. Following on from this, most respondents perceived sustainable aquaculture production positively, implying social acceptability for its development. Awareness of and knowledge about sustainable aquaculture positively and significantly affected stakeholders’ support for expansion, suggesting that communication and education may be effective tools for improving social acceptance of aquaculture. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Biodiversity loss from climate and land use change is a global occurrence, but is of particular concern in more prominent biodiverse and sensitive areas such as the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. This region harbors two species of geographically separated brown bear (Ursus arctos) - the Tibetan (U. a. pruinosus) and Himalayan brown bear (U. a. isabellinus). Both serve as important umbrella species, providing many ecological benefits to their surrounding ecosystems. However, how these two species from the same taxonomic group but with distinct geographical ranges, will respond to climate and land use change is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to predict the potential impacts of future climate and land use change on the distribution and dispersal paths of Tibetan and Himalayan brown bears in the HKH region. We applied MaxEnt modeling to predict the distribution of the two bear species both currently and for the year 2070, using three General Circulation Models and three scenarios of climate and land use change. We then identified potential dispersal paths using Circuit Theory. Results showed that both species would be negatively affected by the climate and land use change expected in the 2070s. In all three climate scenarios, their distribution areas would both shrink and shift to higher altitudes. Throughout the HKH region, Tibetan and Himalayan brown bears were predicted to lose over 34% and 32% of currently inhabited area under the most severe climate scenario, respectively. In addition, results showed that the density of dispersal paths for Tibetan brown bear would decrease while dispersal resistance would increase, and that dispersal paths for Himalayan brown bears would shift to higher latitudes. To protect these species, the currently suitable distribution areas and dispersal paths should be considered as priority protected areas. Our findings provide a scientific basis for allocating protected areas in the HKH region that are effective under the context of global climate change, and for establishing transboundary cooperation in the HKH region. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This study was carried out to evaluate the diversity in reptile communities in wetland landscapes located in the Mediterranean region. For this, the status of the reptile populations linked to different Mediterranean wetlands in relation to the different types of land use established in the nearby drainage basins (500 m around the wetlands perimeter) was determined. The different types of land use were determined together with the presence/absence, abundance and size class of the different reptile species. The results showed that areas with high anthropic pressure had a lower diversity of species, as well as a less balanced community structure, that could put at risk the effective recruitment and hence the maintenance of the reptile populations in these areas. The reasons behind the decline in the reptile community are similar to those put forward for explaining the decline in amphibians in the same area. © Firenze University Press.},

abstract={As climate change unfolds, changes in population dynamics and species distribution ranges are expected to fundamentally reshuffle communities worldwide. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and extent of community reorganization remains elusive. This is particularly true in riverine systems, which are simultaneously exposed to changing temperature and streamflow, and where land-use change continues to be a major driver of biodiversity loss. Here, we use the most comprehensive compilation of fish abundance time series to date to provide a global synthesis of climate- and LU-induced effects on riverine biota with respect to changes in species thermal and streamflow affinities. We demonstrate that fish communities are increasingly dominated by thermophilic (warm-water) and limnophilic (slow-water) species. Despite being consistent with trends in water temperature and streamflow observed over recent decades, these community changes appear largely decoupled from each other and show wide spatial variation. We further reveal a synergy among climate- and land use-related drivers, such that community thermophilization is heightened in more human-modified systems. Importantly, communities in which species experience thermal and flow regimes that approach or exceed their tolerance thresholds (high community sensitivity), as well as species-poor communities (low community resilience), also display faster rates of compositional change. This research illustrates that quantifying vulnerability of riverine systems to climate change requires a broadening from a narrower thermal focus to more integrative approaches that account for the spatially varying and multifaceted sensitivity of riverine organisms to the interactive effects of water temperature, hydrology, and other anthropogenic changes. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Conservation initiatives rarely achieve the scale required to respond to ongoing biodiversity loss. Understanding what drives the adoption of conservation initiatives provides key insights into how initiatives expand to a scale necessary for effective conservation outcomes. In this article, we identified characteristics of conservation initiatives, adopters, and context that influenced the adoption of extensive Wildlife Management Units (UMAs) in Mexico. We interviewed 22 experts to gather their perceptions about the factors driving the adoption and spread of UMAs, and their interactions. We used Diffusion of Innovation Theory and qualitative data analysis to develop a theory of change based on the experts' perceptions that illustrates what led landholders to adopt UMAs. We found that: (a) the adoption of UMAs depended on the landholders' ability to learn about, register, and implement them; (b) alignment with the landholders' objectives and private tenure facilitated adoption, reflecting the likelihood and ease of participation, respectively; and (c) observability of benefits and the availability of technical advice were key to adoption, influencing the speed of adoption by facilitating learning. Our empirically derived theory of change describing the adoption of UMAs revealed focused and clear hypotheses that can be further tested quantitatively. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The destruction of freshwater habitat is a major contributor to biodiversity loss in aquatic ecosystems. However, created or restored wetlands could partially mitigate aquatic biodiversity loss by increasing the amount of available habitat across a landscape. We investigated the impact of surrounding terrestrial habitat and water quality variables on suitability for two species of pond-breeding amphibians (bullfrogs [Lithobates catesbeianus] and Blanchard's cricket frogs [Acris blanchardi]) in created permanent wetlands located on an agricultural landscape. We examined tadpole growth and survival in field enclosures placed in ponds surrounded by agricultural, forested, or grassland habitats. We also evaluated the potential for carryover effects of the aquatic environment on terrestrial growth and overwinter survival of cricket frog metamorphs. We found that habitat adjacent to ponds did not predict tadpole growth or survival. Rather, phytoplankton abundance, which showed high variability among ponds within habitat type, was the only predictor of tadpole growth. Cricket frogs emerged larger and earlier from ponds with higher phytoplankton abundance; bullfrogs were also larger and at a more advanced developmental stage in ponds with higher levels of phytoplankton. Overwinter survival of cricket frogs was explained by size at metamorphosis and there were no apparent carryover effects of land use or pond-of-origin on overwinter growth and survival. Our results demonstrate that created ponds in human-dominated landscapes can provide suitable habitat for some anurans, independent of the adjacent terrestrial habitat. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

abstract={A paleontological deposit near San Clemente de Térapa represents one of the very few Rancholabrean North American Land Mammal Age sites within Sonora, Mexico. During that time, grasslands were common, and the climate included cooler and drier summers and wetter winters than currently experienced in northern Mexico. Here, we demonstrate restructuring in the mammalian community associated with environmental change over the past 40,000 years at Térapa. The fossil community has a similar number of carnivores and herbivores whereas the modern community consists mostly of carnivores. There was also a 97% decrease in mean body size (from 289 kg to 9 kg) because of the loss of megafauna. We further provide an updated review of ungulates and carnivores, recognizing two distinct morphotypes of Equus, including E. scotti and a slighter species; as well as Platygonus compressus; Camelops hesternus; Canis dirus; and Lynx rufus; and the first regional records of Palaeolama mirifica, Procyon lotor, and Smilodon cf. S. fatalis. The Térapa mammals presented here provide a more comprehensive understanding of the faunal community restructuring that occurred in northern Mexico from the late Pleistocene to present day, indicating further potential biodiversity loss with continued warming and drying of the region.

abstract={Environmental change through habitat fragmentation and urbanization drives biodiversity loss in the Neotropics at an alarming rate. Some individuals and species confined to habitat fragments may develop phenotypic adjustments that allow populations to persist, even in landscapes made harsh by human activities. Behavioral and morphological adjustments may enhance a population’s ability to cope with anthropogenic hazards. We examined potential differences in the behavioral and morphological phenotype of populations of the neotropical Wedge-billed Woodcreeper (Glyphorynchus spirurus)—an understory forest specialist insectivorous bird—between populations from urban fragmented forests and continuous preserved forests. We evaluated exploratory behavior and morphological traits using generalized linear models and linear discriminant analysis to quantify phenotypical differences among populations. We used failure time analysis to compare latency to explore and move during exploration in a Novel Environment Test (NET). Our analyses detected differences in certain movement behaviors (latencies to move during NET), indicating that individuals from fragmented forests are slow explorers in relation to individuals from the continuous forest. We also found shorter tarsi and tails in the fragmented forest population which were attributed to an overall reduction in body size in these populations. Our results suggest that environmental change driven by fragmentation in an urban landscape is causing population differentiation, but we cannot ascribe observed variations to evolutionary processes only, as the differences observed may be explained by other processes too. However, we suggest that phenotypic differences may be aiding this small understory forest specialist to persist in an urban fragmented landscape. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Substantial evidence now suggests that a positive diversity–stability relationship exists. Yet few studies examine the facets of biodiversity that contribute to this relationship, and empirical research is predominantly conducted on grassland communities under controlled conditions. We investigate the roles of species richness, environmental condition (vegetation cover), asynchrony, and weighted population stability in driving community stability across multiple taxa. We used data from a Long-term Ecological Research project to investigate temporal stability of annual plants, beetles, reptiles, and rodents in Nizzanim Coastal Sand Dune Nature Reserve in Israel. All four taxa had a strong positive relationship between asynchrony and community stability. Only rodents showed a positive richness–stability relationship. Perennial plant cover had a significant relationship with community stability for three taxa, but the direction of the correlation varied. Asynchrony had a stronger relationship with perennial plant cover than it did with richness for both plants and beetles. We suggest that community stability is driven by asynchrony for flora as well as fauna. Stability appears to be determined by species’ interactions and their responses to the environment, and not always by diversity. This has important consequences for understanding the effects of environmental degradation on ecosystem stability and productivity, which have destabilizing consequences beyond biodiversity loss. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Amphibians are an understudied group in the zoo-focussed literature. Whilst commonly housed in specialist exhibits and of real conservation value due to the global extinction crisis, amphibian welfare is not often investigated empirically in zoo settings. The limited research that is available suggests that enclosure design (structure, planting and naturalistic theming) has a positive impact on the time that amphibians will be on show to visitors. However, the categorisation of any “visitor effect” (i.e., influences of visitor presence on amphibian activity and time on display) is hard to find. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of zoological organisations in the UK for several months from March 2020, with gradual re-openings from the summer into autumn and winter. This event provided a unique opportunity to study the effect of the lack of visitors, the presence of essential zoo staff only, the wider return of organisational staff, and then the return of visitors over a prolonged period. This project at WWT Slimbridge Wetlands Centre assessed the number of individuals of six species of amphibian—common toad (Bufo bufo), common frog (Rana temporaria), smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), pool frog (Pelophylax lessonae), golden mantella (Mantella aurantiaca) and golden poison dart frog (Phyllobates terribilis)—visible to observers under different conditions. All amphibians were housed in a purpose-built indoor exhibit of individual enclosures and were recorded when visible (as a proportion of the total population of the enclosure) during closure, the return of extra centre staff and visitor periods. The results showed species-specific differences in visibility, with some species of amphibian being more likely to be on view when the presence of people at their enclosure was less likely or in smaller numbers. Such differences are likely related to the specific camouflage or anti-predation tactics in these focal species. Further study to quantify amphibian sensitivity to, and perception of, environmental change caused by public presence (e.g., light levels and sound) would be useful welfare-themed research extensions. Our results can help inform husbandry, collection planning and amphibian enclosure design to reduce any noticeable visitor effects, and provide a useful benchmark for further, more complex, welfare assessment measures. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Essential to the provision of important ecosystems services, i.e., food production, soil is suffering great pressure. The degradation of natural areas in order to turn them into croplands has been causing severe effects to the soil quality, including the maintenance of their biodiversity. Soil physical disruption reduce the soil biodiversity and, consequently, may cause negative effects to the supporting services, i.e., organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling, which will directly or indirectly impact agroecosystems. In this study, the influence of three different types of land uses (native forest (NF), conventional agriculture (CA), and organic agriculture (OA)) to the soil mesofauna (emphasizing collembolan and mites) were assessed under real scenarios in the southeast part of Brazil. Both conventional and organic fields were of strawberries, and the greatest difference in their processes was the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, performed at CA. Soil fauna organisms were collected and identified to main groups, except the collembolan species which were further separated into four main groups/family. Results showed that not only the physical changes due to soil tillage caused negative effects to soil fauna. In the field where the use of agricultural products was allowed, organisms were much more severely affected. Hence, the conversion of natural forested areas to agricultural lands may harm soil fauna communities through biodiversity loss. This study not only adds significant information to the knowledge regarding the relation between biodiversity loss and agricultural practices worldwide, but it also helps to improve Brazilian knowledge of the edaphic fauna in agroecosystems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Snakebite envenoming is a set of intoxication diseases that disproportionately affect people of poor socioeconomic backgrounds in tropical countries. As it is highly dependent on the environment its burden is expected to shift spatially with global anthropogenic environmental (climate, land use) and demographic change. The mechanisms underlying the changes to snakebite epidemiology are related to factors of snakes and humans. The distribution and abundance of snakes are expected to change with global warming via their thermal tolerance, while rainfall may affect the timing of key activities like feeding and reproduction. Human population growth is the primary cause of land-use change, which may impact snakes at smaller spatial scales than climate via habitat and biodiversity loss (e.g. prey availability). Human populations, on the other hand, could experience novel patterns and morbidity of snakebite envenoming, both as a result of snake responses to environmental change and due to the development of agricultural adaptations to climate change, socioeconomic and cultural changes, development and availability of better antivenoms, personal protective equipment, and mechanization of agriculture that mediate risk of encounters with snakes and their outcomes. The likely global effects of environmental and demographic change are thus context-dependent and could encompass both increasing and or snakebite burden (incidence, number of cases or morbidity), exposing new populations to snakes in temperate areas due to “tropicalization”, or by land use change-induced snake biodiversity loss, respectively. Tackling global change requires drastic measures to ensure large-scale ecosystem functionality. However, as ecosystems represent the main source of venomous snakes their conservation should be accompanied by comprehensive public health campaigns. The challenges associated with the joint efforts of biodiversity conservation and public health professionals should be considered in the global sustainability agenda in a wider context that applies to neglected tropical and zoonotic and emerging diseases. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Context: Invasive species are a major cause of biodiversity loss across much of the world, and a key threat to Australia's diverse reptile fauna. There has been no previous comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of the introduced European red fox, Vulpes vulpes, on Australian reptiles. Aims: We seek to provide an inventory of all Australian reptile species known to be consumed by the fox, and identify characteristics of squamate species associated with such predation. We also compare these tallies and characteristics with reptile species known to be consumed by the domestic cat, Felis catus, to examine whether predation by these two introduced species is compounded (i.e. affecting much the same set of species) or complementary (affecting different groups of species). Methods: We collated records of Australian reptiles consumed by foxes in Australia, with most records deriving from fox dietary studies (tallying >35 000 samples). We modelled presence or absence of fox predation records against a set of biological and other traits, and population trends, for squamate species. Key results: In total, 108 reptile species (∼11% of Australia's terrestrial reptile fauna) have been recorded as consumed by foxes, fewer than that reported for cats (263 species). Eighty-six species have been reported to be eaten by both predators. More Australian turtle species have been reported as consumed by foxes than by cats, including many that suffer high levels of predation on egg clutches. Twenty threatened reptile species have been reported as consumed by foxes, and 15 by cats. Squamate species consumed by foxes are more likely to be undergoing population decline than those not known to be consumed by foxes. The likelihood of predation by foxes increased with squamate species' adult body mass, in contrast to the relationship for predation by cats, which peaked at ∼217 g. Foxes, but not cats, were also less likely to consume venomous snakes. Conclusions: The two introduced, and now widespread, predators have both compounding and complementary impacts on the Australian reptile fauna. Implications: Enhanced and integrated management of the two introduced predators is likely to provide substantial conservation benefits to much of the Australian reptile fauna. © 2021 Journal Compilation},

abstract={Rocky environments host rich levels of biodiversity and provide vital habitat for specialised organisms, range-restricted species and a broad range of ectotherms adapted to saxicoline environments. In Australia, rock habitat is being destroyed during soil amelioration practices associated with agricultural intensification. Advances in rock crushing technology, developed to expand or increase crop yields and efficiency, pose an undocumented threat to global biodiversity, especially reptiles dependent on non-renewable rock habitat in agricultural landscapes. Rock removal is a legislated key threatening process in parts of Australia and will accelerate biodiversity loss if not mitigated. We estimated reptile species’ range overlap with dryland cropping and modified pastoral regions within the Australian wheat-sheep zone to assess the potential impacts of rock crushing practices. We examined species- and family-richness within the impact zone and across bioregions within the impact zone, to identify areas where rock removal has the greatest potential to impact terrestrial and fossorial squamates. Our analysis revealed that 159 potentially impacted reptile species occur within the study area, representing 16% of Australian terrestrial squamates. Fourteen of these species, including six threatened species, have more than 50% range overlap with areas of intensive agriculture, and include several endangered pygopodids, scincids and agamids. Bioregions rich in rock and burrow-dwelling reptiles include the Brigalow Belt South, Murray Darling Depression, Darling Riverine Plains, Eyre Yorke Block, Avon Wheatbelt, Nandewar, Flinders Lofty Block and New South Wales South Western Slopes. Synthesis and applications. The conservation of reptiles in agricultural landscapes requires appropriate management and retention of surface rocks. Potential yield increases from destroying rock habitat to intensify or expand cropland will not compensate for the net loss of reptile populations dependent on non-renewable resources. Financial incentives to prevent the expansion and transformation of non-arable landscapes to cropland are required to prevent the ongoing loss of biodiversity. © 2021 British Ecological Society},

abstract={As resources for conservation are limited, gathering and analysing information from digital platforms can help investigate the global biodiversity crisis in a cost-efficient manner. Development and application of methods for automated content analysis of digital data sources are especially important in the context of investigating human–nature interactions. In this study, we introduce novel application methods to automatically collect and analyse textual data on species of conservation concern from digital platforms. An end-to-end pipeline is constructed that begins from searching and downloading news articles about species listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) along with news articles from specific Twitter handles and proceeds with implementing natural language processing and machine learning methods to filter and retain only relevant articles. A crucial aspect here is the automatic annotation of training data, which can be challenging in many machine learning applications. A Named Entity Recognition model is then used to extract additional relevant information for each article. The data collected over a 1-month period included 15,088 articles focusing on 585 species listed in Appendix I of CITES. The accuracy of the neural network to detect relevant articles was 95.91% while the Named Entity recognition model helped extract information on prices, location and quantities of traded animals and plants. A regularly updated database, which can be queried and analysed for various research purposes and to inform conservation decision making, is generated by the system. The results demonstrate that natural language processing can be used successfully to extract information from digital text content. The proposed methods can be applied to multiple digital data platforms at the same time and used to investigate human–nature interactions in conservation science and practice. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Global climate changes and anthropogenic pressures have altered many coastal ecosystems worldwide. To understand the consequences of these perturbations on the community structure of the benthic communities, the fauna and the sediments retrieved from a short core in the Manzala Lagoon, which is largest in the Nile Delta, were quantitatively analyzed. The 120 cm long-core represents 170 years. A significant ecosystem shift took place in the upper 41 cm of the lagoon sediments were attributed to hydrodynamic changes, associated with the construction of Aswan High-Dam, where heavy metals concentrations, Pollution Load Index (PLI), and fine-grain sediments were increased. Consequently, the community structure of the benthic fauna was dramatically changed. Currently, the benthic community is dominated by brackish and opportunistic taxa (e.g., Fulvia fragilis, Pirenella conica, Corbicula fluminalis, and Melanoides tuberculata). In contrast, the pre-impact community contains equilibrium freshwater species. These salinity-controlled communities were better characterized on both Bray-Curtis -based Constrained Clustering (CC) and non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS). The faunal density and Dominance Index are higher in the top samples, which point either to anthropogenic disturbance or taphonomic (mechanical or chemical) distortion with depths. However, higher species richness in lower samples suggested that the mechanical distortion has not altered the original communities and point to anthropogenic drivers of the diversity loss. Further declining or even extinction of the equilibrium species in the future is expected if no restoration programs implemented soon. Furthermore, nMDS and RMA regression models showed that the distribution of benthic fauna is governed by abiotic factors (e.g., water salinity, metal concentrations, and sediment grain-size). The latter indicates that biotic traits of benthic fauna such as feeding-mode and life-habit are highly sensitive to minor environmental changes and thus can be used as a robust indicator in paleoenvironmental reconstructions. © 2021},

abstract={Invasive alien species (IAS) can act as vectors for the introduction of pathogens in ecosystems and their transmission to threatened native species (TNS), leading to biodiversity loss, population reductions and extinctions. We assessed pathogens potentially occurring in a set of IAS in the Southern Cone of South America and identified TNS potentially vulnerable to their effects. Also, we assessed how risk analysis systems proposed or adopted by national authorities in the study region value the importance of pathogens. We identified 324 pathogens in the selected IAS, which could potentially affect 202 TNS. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) was the IAS with the largest number of pathogens (91), followed by domestic dog (Canis familiaris) (62), red deer (Cervus elaphus) (58), rock dove (Columba livia) (37), American vison (Neovison vison) (18), European hare (Lepus europaeus) (17), common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) (12), common slider (Trachemys scripta) (6), and American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) (2). Most TNS were in the “vulnerable” IUCN category, followed by “endangered” and “critically endangered” species. Bacteria were the most frequently represented pathogens (112), followed by ectoparasites (78), viruses (69), protozoa and other (65). The direct effects of IAS on native wildlife are beginning to be addressed in South America, and their potential impact as pathogen spreaders to native wildlife has remained largely unexplored. Risk analysis systems associated with the introduction of IAS are scarce in this region. Although the existing systems contemplate hazard analyses for the co-introduction of pathogens, they underestimate the potential impact of diseases on TNS. Conservation efforts in the region would benefit from systems which give pathogen risk a relevant place, and from government agencies promoting targeted disease surveillance in IAS and wildlife. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Aquatic ecosystems are at risk of being impaired by various organic chemicals, however comprehensive large-scale evaluations of waterbodies’ status and trends are rare. Here, surface water monitoring data, gathered as part of the EU Water Framework Directive and comprising the occurrence of 352 organic contaminants (>8.3 mil. measurements; 2001–2015; 8213 sites) in 31 European countries, was used to evaluate past and current environmental risks for three aquatic species groups: fish, invertebrates, plants. Monitoring quality indices were defined per country and found to improve over time. Relationships became apparent between countries’ monitoring quality index and their success in detecting contaminants. Across the EU, contaminants were more frequently found in recent years. Overall, 35.7% (n = 17,484) of sites exceeded at least one acute regulatory threshold level (RTL) each year, and average risks significantly increased over time for fish (τ = 0.498, p = 0.01) and aquatic invertebrates (τ = 0.429, p = 0.03). This indicates an increased chemical pressure to Europe's waterbodies and overall large-scale threshold exceedances. Pesticides were identified as the main risk drivers (>85% of RTL exceedances) with aquatic invertebrates being most acutely at risk in Europe. Agricultural land-use was clearly identified as the primary spatial driver of the observed aquatic risks throughout European surface waters. Issues in monitoring data heterogeneity were highlighted and also followed by subsequent improvement recommendations, strengthening future environmental quality assessments. Overall, aquatic ecosystem integrity remains acutely at risk across Europe, signaling the demand for continued improvements. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Biodiversity loss affects ecosystem functioning. Top down effects of amphibian declines on the trophic food web of the forest floor are poorly understood. Here we quantify and explain the effects of disease-driven loss of salamanders on the dynamics of forest leaf litter. Using paired mesocosms, within a Belgian forest, we tested the effect of fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) presence on the trophic cascade that results in the decomposition rate of good quality (maple - Acer pseudoplatanus) and poorer quality (oak - Quercus robur) leaf litter, over an 18 month period. The presence of salamanders reduced decomposition rate of Quercus litter up to 20%. This was associated with a significantly higher predation rate on detritivores, which altered the functional composition of the invertebrate community. Functional composition analysis of the litter microbiome showed less bacteria associated with leaf litter degradation on the Quercus litter in the presence of salamanders. Salamanders thus influence ecosystem functions through trophic cascades and promote the retention of the leaf litter fraction in poorer quality litter. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Loss of biodiversity can affect transmission of infectious diseases in at least two ways: by altering host and vector abundance or by influencing host and vector behaviour. We used a large herbivore exclusion experiment to investigate the effects of wildlife loss on the abundance and feeding behaviour of mosquito vectors and to explore consequences for vector-borne disease transmission. Large herbivore loss affected both mosquito abundance and blood-feeding behaviour. For Aedes mcintoshi, the dominant mosquito species in our study and a primary vector of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), abundance decreased with large herbivore loss, while blood feeding on humans increased. Despite an elevated human biting rate in the absence of large herbivores, we estimated that the potential for RVFV transmission to humans doubles in the presence of large herbivores. These results demonstrate that multiple effects of biodiversity loss on vectors can lead to counterintuitive outcomes for human disease risk. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

abstract={Unsustainable and illegal wildlife trade are contributing to the unprecedented levels of biodiversity loss and possible extinction of one million species. Law enforcement and the criminal justice system have a role to play in helping to regulate and monitor such trade. The main international instrument to regulate wildlife trade is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This mixed methods study researched the lessons learned and best practice in regards to implementation of and compliance with CITES. As part of the study, three countries were identified as case studies and Canada was selected as one of these. Lessons can also be learned from Canada’s Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act, which is cumbersome to update when species protections change within CITES. Canada has several elements of good practice, such as the remit, effectiveness and relationships of the three CITES authorities located within Environment and Climate Change Canada, the public health approach to some wildlife imports, and the protection of native CITES species. CITES needs to be improved to further protect endangered species and lessons from Canada and other countries can contribute to this improvement. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Unsustainable and illegal wildlife trade is a well-known conservation issue, but there are still large gaps in our understanding of how trade chains operate for the majority of over-exploited wildlife products. In particular, the large-scale global plant trade is under-reported and under-researched, and this is even more pronounced when the trade takes place within a country’s borders. A clear example is the trade in orchids, all species of which are listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Although countries such as Viet Nam are known hotspots for the large-scale collection of wild orchids for the international horticultural trade, little is known about how plants move from the wild to the end-consumer, what role is played by domestic markets and the sustainability of this trade. We use a mixed-methods approach to determine the structure of trade chains for orchids in key trading areas of Northern Viet Nam, and use a thematic framework to identify five groups of actors trading wild-harvested orchids. Trade occurs both domestically and internationally, underpinned by demand for rare, wild plants. An important first step to address the illegal and unsustainable plant trade is to recognise it as a major and growing conservation issue, and develop diverse approaches that consider the complexity of the supply chains involved. It is imperative that the scale and process of domestic trade is understood, and its impact on long term conservation of these species assessed to make more informed decisions about effective interventions that take into account the full supply chain. © Copyright © 2021 Bullough, Nguyễn, Drury and Hinsley.},

abstract={Grazing activities perhaps lead to habitat quality degradation and animal biodiversity loss while the effects on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is still relatively poorly studied. Based on the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model, geographical detector model and generalized linear mixed model, the responses of habitat quality and animal biodiversity to grazing activities at 5 km grid scale were analyzed. Results showed that the overall habitat quality on the QTP was high with 76.43% of the total area, and poor level accounted for 19.56%. High level habitat was mainly distributed in the southern part, while the poor level in the northern part. The mean grazing activity explanatory ability to habitat quality, bird species richness and mammal richness were 0.346, 0.430, and 0.354. The interaction effects between slope and grazing activities on habitat quality, bird species richness and mammal richness were the most important interaction effects, and the area affected by the interaction was 73.82, 46.00, and 46.17% of habitat quality, bird species richness and mammal richness, respectively. The interaction effects on habitat quality, bird species richness and mammal richness all showed “low in the northwest and high in the southeast”. Grazing activities and habitat quality had a positive correlation while bird species richness, and mammal richness negative correlations. The spatial relationship of grazing activities of habitat quality was “higher in the middle and lower around the periphery”, while the spatial distribution of grazing activities of bird species richness and mammal richness was “higher in the east and lower in the west”. This study explicitly revealed the responses of habitat quality and animal biodiversity to grazing activities, thus providing references for biodiversity conservation on the QTP. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Liu, Wang, Sun, Li, Wang and Yu.},

abstract={Declines of large predatory fish due to overexploitation are restructuring food webs across the globe. It is now becoming evident that restoring these altered food webs requires addressing not only ecological processes, but evolutionary ones as well, because human-induced rapid evolution may in turn affect ecological dynamics. We studied the potential for niche differentiation between different plate armor phenotypes in a rapidly expanding population of a small prey fish, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). In the central Baltic Sea, three-spined stickleback abundance has increased dramatically during the past decades. The increase in this typical mesopredator has restructured near-shore food webs, increased filamentous algal blooms, and threatens coastal biodiversity. Time-series data covering 22 years show that the increase coincides with a decline in the number of juvenile perch (Perca fluviatilis), the most abundant predator of stickleback along the coast. We investigated the distribution of different stickleback plate armor phenotypes depending on latitude, environmental conditions, predator and prey abundances, nutrients, and benthic production; and described the stomach content of the stickleback phenotypes using metabarcoding. We found two distinct lateral armor plate phenotypes of stickleback, incompletely and completely plated. The proportion of incompletely plated individuals increased with increasing benthic production and decreasing abundances of adult perch. Metabarcoding showed that the stomach content of the completely plated individuals more often contained invertebrate herbivores (amphipods) than the incompletely plated ones. Since armor plates are defense structures favored by natural selection in the presence of fish predators, the phenotype distribution suggests that a novel low-predation regime favors stickleback with less armor. Our results suggest that morphological differentiation of the three-spined stickleback has the potential to affect food web dynamics and influence the persistence and resilience of the stickleback take-over in the Baltic Sea. © 2021 The Authors.},

abstract={The ongoing biodiversity crisis reinforces the urgent need to unravel diversity patterns and the underlying processes shaping them. Although taxonomic diversity has been extensively studied and is considered the common currency, simultaneously conserving other facets of diversity (e.g., functional diversity) is critical to ensure ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. Here, we explored the effect of key climatic factors (temperature, precipitation, temperature seasonality, and precipitation seasonality) and factors reflecting human pressures (agricultural land, urban land, land-cover diversity, and human population density) on the functional diversity. (functional richness and Rao’s quadratic entropy) and species richness of amphibians (68 species), reptiles (107 species), and mammals (176 species) in Europe. We explored the relationship between different predictors and diversity metrics using generalized additive mixed model analysis, to capture non-linear relationships and to account for spatial autocorrelation. We found that at this broad continental spatial scale, climatic variables exerted a significant effect on the functional diversity and species richness of all taxa. On the other hand, variables reflecting human pressures contributed significantly in the models even though their explanatory power was lower compared to climatic variables. In most cases, functional richness and Rao’s quadratic entropy responded similarly to climate and human pressures. In conclusion, climate is the most influential factor in shaping both the functional diversity and species richness patterns of amphibians, reptiles, and mammals in Europe. However, incorporating factors reflecting human pressures complementary to climate could be conducive to us understanding the drivers of functional diversity and richness patterns. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Global biodiversity loss is a profound consequence of human activity. Disturbingly, biodiversity loss is greater than realized because of the unknown number of undocumented species. Conservation fundamentally relies on taxonomic recognition of species, but only a fraction of biodiversity is described. Here, we provide a new quantitative approach for prioritizing rigorous taxonomic research for conservation. We implement this approach in a highly diverse vertebrate group—Australian lizards and snakes. Of 870 species assessed, we identified 282 (32.4%) with taxonomic uncertainty, of which 17.6% likely comprise undescribed species of conservation concern. We identify 24 species in need of immediate taxonomic attention to facilitate conservation. Using a broadly applicable return-on-investment framework, we demonstrate the importance of prioritizing the fundamental work of identifying species before they are lost. © 2021 Melville et al.

abstract={One of the principal drivers of biodiversity loss is habitat loss due to land conversion for agriculture. Understanding how agricultural landscapes can be more biodiverse is critical in devising a working lands conservation plan. For at least 20 years, some bird populations in the Galapagos have been in sharp decline, especially in the agricultural zone. Since 2010, we found that the relative abundance of ten out of eleven monitored landbird species has further decreased. We examined the existing habitat structures in the agricultural zone of Santa Cruz, historically established in former areas of native humid forest (Scalesia), and analyzed which structures associated with higher landbird diversity and abundance of four declining species. We conducted standardized point counts and surveyed surrounding vegetation during the breeding period. Landbird diversity was highest in forest and coffee sites and least diverse in pasture sites. Main predictors of higher landbird diversity were forest patch presence, increased abundance of native vegetation and lower elevations. Main predictors of higher landbird relative abundance were percentage of forest in the surrounding 200 m radius buffer and forest patch presence. Our results suggest that to increase the contribution of farmlands to landbird conservation during the reproductive period, habitat management efforts should be targeted at increasing forest patches and/or corridors, particularly within pasture farms. Nevertheless, to ensure sustainability of these measures, economic value to the considered farmlands needs to be secured, social perspectives incorporated and other important threats to landbirds assessed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Tropical cloud forests (TCFs) are one of the world’s most species- and endemism-rich terrestrial ecosystems. TCFs are threatened by direct human pressures and climate change, yet the fate of these extraordinary ecosystems remains insufficiently quantified. With discussions of the post-2020 biodiversity framework underway, TCFs are a defining test case of the success and promise of recent policy targets and their associated mechanisms to avert the global biodiversity crisis. Here we present a global assessment of the recent status and trends of TCFs and their biodiversity and evaluate the efficacy of current protection measures. We find that cloud forests occupied 0.4% of the global land surface in 2001 and harboured ~3,700 species of birds, mammal, amphibians and tree ferns (~15% of the global diversity of those groups), with half of those species entirely restricted to cloud forests. Worldwide, ~2.4% of cloud forests (in some regions, more than 8%) were lost between 2001 and 2018, especially in readily accessible places. While protected areas have slowed this decline, a large proportion of loss in TCF cover is still occurring despite formal protection. Increased conservation efforts are needed to avert the impending regional or global demise of TCFs and their unique biodiversity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Islands are epicenters of animal extinctions and population declines. These losses exacerbate biodiversity loss and disrupt ecological services in areas of high endemism. Island defaunation is primarily driven by invasive mammalian predators, and mammal eradications are reversing population declines for some island species. Invasive mammal eradications may also have the capacity to restore ecological interactions, along with the recovery of island fauna. Here we show that invasive mammal eradication in fenced ecosanctuaries results in higher rates of bird foraging on fruit, and higher bird-mediated seed dispersal, than in similar forests without mammal eradication. We further show that higher foraging and seed dispersal is related to higher densities of native bird species, after accounting for natural variation in fruit availability. For the many other systems globally that are under threat from invasive mammals, New Zealand’s fenced ecosanctuary model offers a promising tool for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract={Aim: As habitat loss continues to accelerate with global human population growth, identifying landscape characteristics that influence species occurrence is a key conservation priority in order to prevent global biodiversity loss. In South Africa, the arboreal samango monkey (Cercopithecus albogularis sp.) is threatened due to loss and fragmentation of the indigenous forests it inhabits. The aim of this study was to determine the habitat preferences of the samango monkey at different spatial scales, and to identify key conservation areas to inform management plans for this species. Location: This study was carried out in the western Soutpansberg Mountains, which represents the northernmost population of samango monkeys within South Africa, and the only endangered subspecies (C. a. schwarzi). Methods: We used sequentially collected GPS points from two samango monkey groups followed between 2012 and 2017 to quantify the used and available habitat for this species within the western Soutpansberg Mountains. We developed 2nd-order (selection of ranging area), 3rd-order (selection within range), and 4th-order (feeding site selection) resource selection functions (RSFs) to identify important habitat features at each scale. Through scale integration, we identified three key conservation areas for samango monkeys across Limpopo Province, South Africa. Results: Habitat productivity was the most important landscape variable predicting probability of use at each order of selection, indicating the dependence of these arboreal primates on tall-canopy indigenous forests. Critical habitat across Limpopo was highly fragmented, meaning complete isolation between subpopulations is likely. Main conclusions: Understanding the habitat characteristics that influence samango monkey distribution across South Africa is crucial for prioritizing critical habitat for this species. Our results indicated that large, contiguous patches of tall-canopy indigenous forest are fundamental to samango monkey persistence. As such, protected area expansion of large forest patches and creation of forest corridors are identified as key conservation interventions for this species. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The Florida Tampa Electric Company's Manatee Viewing Center (MVC) and its fossil-fuelled Big Bend power plant are separated by a narrow ship channel that serves as state and federal sanctuary for threatened Florida Manatees. As humans have destroyed much of their warm spring habitat, many manatees are forced to rely on power plant hot water effluent to survive during cold winter months. Visitors’ reactions to the MVC are every bit as incongruous as a massive greenhouse gas pollutant source enabling a wildlife reserve. Notwithstanding its inescapable presence, visitor reviews of the MVC nearly uniformly ignore the immense power plant. We offer this study of online reviews of the MVC to examine how and why everyday people's interactions are fundamental to making dominant practices of anthropogenic ecological destruction unremarkable and, therefore, unfixable. Specifically, we argue the collective blindness reflected in the findings of this study exemplifies a broader sociocultural tendency to articulate and reinforce spaces of ecological “invisibility.” In such spaces, our quotidian practices and discourses play a central role in enabling collective environmental inattention and environmental inaction, especially when we are confronted with places in which the constructed binary between human and “natural” realms spectacularly collapses. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Many protected areas (PAs) have been created globally in response to the dramatic human-induced decline in biodiversity. However, not all PAs successfully preserve their biodiversity and continued monitoring is vital to assess the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Here, we repeated a study done in 2003 to assess whether investments in anti-poaching in two partially PAs (PPAs), Grumeti Game Reserve (GGR) and Ikona Wildlife Management Area (IWMA), have had quantifiable impacts on impala (Aepyceros melampus) populations, compared to the adjacent strictly protected Serengeti National Park. Since 2003, management of the PPAs has changed dramatically under the non-profit organisation Grumeti Fund. We predicted that if conservation management had improved, impala populations in 2018 would have higher local density, less female-skewed sex ratio, larger group sizes, and shorter flight initiation distances (FID). To assess these parameters of the impala populations, we conducted the same road-based surveys in 2003 and 2018. We found that compared to 2003, impala population density doubled in GGR, group sizes were larger in IWMA and nearly doubled in GGR, and that impala had shorter FID in IWMA in 2018. Our results suggest that the changes in conservation management could have led to the observed positive impacts for impala populations. Our study is encouraging for managers and reveals a conservation success story: if proper action is taken to increase the protection of wildlife within PPAs, wildlife populations may respond quickly and positively. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={The Convention on Biological Diversity’s post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework will probably include a goal to stabilize and restore the status of species. Its delivery would be facilitated by making the actions required to halt and reverse species loss spatially explicit. Here, we develop a species threat abatement and restoration (STAR) metric that is scalable across species, threats and geographies. STAR quantifies the contributions that abating threats and restoring habitats in specific places offer towards reducing extinction risk. While every nation can contribute towards halting biodiversity loss, Indonesia, Colombia, Mexico, Madagascar and Brazil combined have stewardship over 31% of total STAR values for terrestrial amphibians, birds and mammals. Among actions, sustainable crop production and forestry dominate, contributing 41% of total STAR values for these taxonomic groups. Key Biodiversity Areas cover 9% of the terrestrial surface but capture 47% of STAR values. STAR could support governmental and non-state actors in quantifying their contributions to meeting science-based species targets within the framework. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={The Bird's Head Seascape (BHS), Papua, Indonesia is located within the epicenter of global marine biodiversity and has been the focus of recent conservation efforts to protect marine resources. Here, we provide an overview of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) progress in the BHS over the past decade, including establishment history, changes in management effectiveness and ecosystem health, as well as examining trends in tourism growth. While generally viewed as a conservation success story, we reflect on both successes and challenges in the BHS, identifying where we need to continue to improve and adapt in response to rapid economic and environmental change. As of 2020, BHS MPAs cover 5.1 million ha across 23 MPAs. As expected, management effectiveness is steadily increasing in BHS MPAs—although newer MPAs face substantial capacity gaps. Tourism is rapidly growing—with an almost 3,000% increase in tourist visits between 2007 and 2018. Overall, hard coral cover in monitored BHS MPAs remained stable at 33% from 2010 to 2019, although trends in reef fish biomass were more variable. Given continued conservation challenges in the region, BHS MPAs are successfully preventing biodiversity loss while providing ecosystem services for local communities. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={We compile a Mexican insular herpetofaunal checklist to estimate endemism, conservation status, island threats, net taxonomic turnover among six biogeographic provinces belonging to the Nearctic and Neotropical regions, and the relationships between island area and mainland distance versus species richness. We compile a checklist of insular herpetofaunal through performing a literature and collection review. We define the conservation status according to conservation Mexican law, the Red List of International Union for Conservation of Nature, and Environmental Vulnerability Scores. We determine threat percentages on islands according to the 11 major classes of threats to biodiversity. We estimate the net taxonomic turnover with beta diversity analysis between the Nearctic and Neotropical provinces. The Mexican insular herpetofauna is composed of 18 amphibian species, 204 species with 101 subspecies of reptiles, and 263 taxa in total. Endemism levels are 11.76% in amphibians, 53.57% in reptiles, and 27.91% being insular endemic taxa. Two conservation status systems classify the species at high extinction risk, while the remaining system suggests less concern. However, all systems indicate species lacking assessment. Human activities and exotic alien species are present on 60% of 131 islands. The taxonomic turnover value is high (0.89), with a clear herpetofaunal differentiation between the two biogeographic regions. The species–area and species–mainland distance relationships are positive. Insular herpetofauna faces a high percentage of threats, with the Neotropical provinces more heavily impacted. It is urgent to explore the remaining islands (3,079 islands) and better incorporate insular populations and species in ecological, evolutionary, and systematic studies. In the face of the biodiversity crisis, islands will play a leading role as a model to apply restoration and conservation strategies. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={During the mid-nineteenth century, the eminent British zoologist Alfred Newton recognized that some of the ideas embedded in Origin of Species provided new scientific rationales for the preservation of endangered species. He then embarked on a twenty-five-year-long campaign for law reforms and successfully lobbied Parliament to enact three new statutes for the preservation of endangered wild birds that gave priority to the scientific value of rare species. The account of Newton’s campaign presented in this article helps to locate Newton in the nineteenth century conservation movement, while also shining a side light on the relationship between conservation science and policy-making more generally, including the variety of voices and approaches taken to conservation in the UK and US. Today, as we pursue new regulatory responses to critical environmental issues, such as biodiversity loss and climate change, the history of Newton’s campaign offers an early example of a successful approach to science-based law reform. It also shows how some of the issues that Newton and his contemporaries confronted at the science-policy interface in the nineteenth century are enduring and remain relevant today, including debates about; the role of scientist-advocates in policy-making, the criteria that make science advice effective, and whether the “democratization” of science leads to better policy decisions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Sea turtles and boating activities often occur in shared waters. This is problematic because sea turtles are susceptible to vessel strikes since they spend significant portions of their lives in nearshore shallow water to breathe, reproduce, and feed. Targeted conservation strategies are needed to reduce vessel strikes on sea turtles, and successful integration of stakeholder perspectives is necessary for conservation success. Here, we present results from a multi-step approach to investigate responses to potential conservation interventions for reducing vessel strikes on sea turtles. First, challenges and opportunities related to potential interventions that could be used to reduce sea turtle vessel strikes were discussed and assessed by a workshop of conservation and enforcement experts. Second, the workshop-identified interventions were incorporated into a survey questionnaire for recreational boaters. Third, this face-to-face survey was administered around the St. Lucie Inlet, an area identified as a vessel strike “hot spot” in Florida (USA). The questionnaire asked about boating preferences and practices, existing and potential conservation interventions, and sea turtle presence in the area. Respondents suggested that greater community support for implementation of interventions would be obtained if they (1) were voluntary rather than mandatory/legislated, (2) overlapped with existing interventions (e.g., if speed mitigation zones for sea turtles overlapped significantly with existing speed reduction zones for manatees) and/or added minimal new restrictions and inconveniences, and (3) were accompanied by explanatory materials on the need for, and the effectiveness of, such management strategies. Boater buy-in for management strategies and compliance can vary significantly. As such, our exploratory study should be replicated where proposed sea turtle conservation-related strategies might be warranted to ensure proper contextual fit. Boaters are a powerful, integral, and a growing demographic that must be effectively and respectfully engaged for effective sea turtle conservation in Florida and beyond. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Megadams are among the key modern drivers of habitat and biodiversity loss in emerging economies. The Balbina Hydroelectric Dam of Central Brazilian Amazonia inundated 312,900 ha of primary forests and created approximately 3500 variable-sized islands that still harbor vertebrate populations after nearly 3 decades after isolation. We estimated the species richness, abundance, biomass, composition, and group size of medium- to large-bodied forest vertebrates in response to patch, landscape, and habitat-quality metrics across 37 islands and 3 continuous forest sites throughout the Balbina archipelago. We conducted 1168 km of diurnal censuses and had 12,420 camera-trapping days along 81 transects with 207 camera stations. We determined the number of individuals (or groups) detected per 10 km walked and the number of independent photographs per 10 camera-trapping days, respectively, for each species. We recorded 34 species, and patch area was the most significant predictor of vertebrate population relative abundance and aggregate biomass. The maximum group size of several group-living species was consistently larger on large islands and in continuous patches than on small islands. Most vertebrate populations were extirpated after inundation. Remaining populations are unlikely to survive further ecological disruptions. If all vertebrate species were once widely distributed before inundation, we estimated that approximately 75% of all individual vertebrates were lost from all 3546 islands and 7.4% of the animals in all persisting insular populations are highly likely to be extirpated. Our results demonstrate that population abundance estimates should be factored into predictions of community disassembly on small islands to robustly predict biodiversity outcomes. Given the rapidly escalating hydropower infrastructure projects in developing counties, we suggest that faunal abundance and biomass estimates be considered in environmental impact assessments and large strictly protected reserves be established to minimize detrimental effects of dams on biodiversity. Conserving large tracts of continuous forests represents the most critical conservation measure to ensure that animal populations can persist at natural densities in Amazonian forests. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={The current biodiversity crisis calls for effective conservation measures. However, some measures may have unforeseen negative consequences on individual species. Herding, a management practice currently used in some wildlife species to protect animals from poachers, can cause habituation to humans, which unintentionally might increase their risk of being poached at a later time. Herding could also negatively impact animal welfare and physiology when perceived as a stressor, with potential negative consequences at the individual and population level. In this study, we tested the following hypotheses: 1) herding elicits habituation to humans in white rhino, and 2) this practice affects the behavior and physiological state of rhino, but they can habituate to it. To that aim, we investigated the effects of herding on the response of rhino to initially unfamiliar people, expression of aggressive and discomfort behaviors, and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations (a commonly used indicator of physiological stress) in two cohorts of six and 10 semi-wild orphan white rhino. Rhino did not interrupt their activity to an approaching person on foot (99%) or in a vehicle (94%), indicating habituation to humans. Aggressive and discomfort behaviors were displayed more often while being herded, and their frequency increased significantly with increasing herding pressure. Finally, overall mean fGCM concentrations were 16.1% higher under herding compared to non-herding conditions, but individual fGCM levels varied up to 17-fold under each scenario, suggesting that herding might not elicit a physiological stress response in these animals. While rhino security is paramount in the current poaching crisis, management practices must ensure that they do not impact negatively at the individual and population level. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London},

abstract={‘Wildlife-friendly’ gardening is a dominant theme in the media that readily engages public attention. However, there is little empirical evidence of the ecological benefits of increased habitat quality of individual domestic gardens. This study uses light-trapping to examine the response of moth assemblages to domestic gardens that are assessed in terms of their habitat complexity (simple and complex) both within the garden and extending out to a 30 m radius that includes surrounding habitats. The results clearly show that moth assemblages were influenced by complex habitats (particularly increasing levels of the variable shrubs and decreasing levels of artificial surfaces), but only at a scale that extended beyond the garden boundary to include the surrounding area. In other words, neither the complexity of the habitat within the garden or the size of the garden had any influence on the abundance or diversity of the moth assemblage. These results have implications for both garden management and landscape planning – if domestic gardens are to be a useful component of strategies to reduce biodiversity loss within the urban environment then they should provide good habitat quality and be managed as a network of interconnected patches rather than as individual units. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={The Atlantic Forest in Brazil is a biodiversity hotspot, yet its diverse ecosystems and species are becoming increasingly threatened by habitat loss and extreme habitat fragmentation. Most habitat patches of Atlantic Forest are dispersed across agricultural landscapes (e.g., grazing and cropping) in relatively small and isolated fragments (80% < 50 ha). Forest fragments < 1 ha, scattered trees in pastures, tree lines on trenches and fences, and remnant riparian forest, collectively called here Small Landscape Elements (SLEs), are very common in this context. While these SLEs make up much of the Atlantic Forests footprint, very little is known about their role or impact on the persistence and conservation of species. In this study, we investigate the role of SLEs on landscape configuration, particularly their contribution toward landscape connectivity of individual species and the genetic flow of species between larger forest fragments. We randomly selected 20 buffers of 707 hectares within a 411,670 hectare area of the Atlantic Forest that was completely covered by forest in the past located in the south of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The forest cover randomly varied between these buffers. We used graph theory to measure landscape connectivity as the probability of connectivity for different disperser movement types between landscape knots (habitat patches). We used three estimated dispersal distances in the models: pollen disperser insect (50 m), low-mobility seed disperser bird (100 m) and high-mobility seed disperser bird (760 m). The SLEs together increased the probability of connection by roughly 50%, for all model dispersers, if compared to a theoretical baseline landscape containing no SLEs. Of all SLEs, riparian forests contribute the most toward enhancing landscape connectivity. In these highly fragmented landscapes, such as the Atlantic Forest (>70%), the position of SLEs within the landscapes was more important than their respective areas for connectivity. Although the landscapes were deeply fragmented, we showed that the presence of SLEs can increase connectivity and reduce further biodiversity loss in the Atlantic Forest. © Copyright © 2021 Siqueira, de Carvalho, Rhodes, Archibald, Rezende and van den Berg.},

abstract={The transformation of ecosystems is known to be a major driver of biodiversity loss. Consequently, supporting tools such as life cycle assessment methods (LCA) include this aspect in the evaluation of a product's environmental performance. Such methods consist of quantifying input and output flows to assess their specific contributions to impact categories. Therefore, land occupation and transformation are considered as inputs to assess biodiversity impacts amongst others. However, the modelling of biodiversity impact in deep seafloor ecosystems is still lacking in LCA. Most of the LCA methods focus on terrestrial biodiversity and none of them can be transposed to benthic deep sea because of knowledge gaps. This manuscript proposes a LCA framework to assess biodiversity impacts in deep seafloor ecosystems. The framework builds upon the existing methods accounting for biodiversity impacts in terrestrial and coastal habitats. A two-step approach is proposed, assessing impacts on regional and on global biodiversity. While the evaluation of regional biodiversity impacts relies only on the benthic communities' response to disturbance, the global perspective considers ecosystem vulnerability and scarcity. Those provide additional perspective for the comparison of impacts occurring in different ecosystems. The framework is operationalised to a case study for deep-sea mining in the Clarion Clipperton Fractures Zone (CCZ). Through the large variety of data sources needed to run the impact evaluation modelling, the framework shows consistency and manages the existing limitations in the understanding of deep seafloor ecosystems, although limitations for its application in the CCZ were observed mainly due to the lack of finer scaled habitat maps and data on connectivity. With growing interest for commercial activities in the deep sea and hence, increased environmental research, this work is a first attempt for the implementation of LCA methods to deep-sea products. © 2021},

abstract={Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been used worldwide on an enormous scale over the last century but are banned globally due to environmental persistence and ecotoxicity in recent decades. The long-term effects of OCP ban for agricultural use in China since 1983 on the reproductive health of small terrestrial mammals have never been evaluated in the field. We examined the residue dynamics of OCPs and the reproductive performance of Chinese striped hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis) in North China Plain during 1983-2010 and concluded that the exposure levels of OCPs in hamsters drastically decreased from 2900 ± 740 to 25.2 ± 6.88 ng/g with an average half-life of 5.08 yrs, coinciding with the observed reproductive recovery of hamsters. The population-based reproductive performance of hamsters was significantly and negatively associated with OCP exposure levels after adjusting the contributions from climate and population density factors, indicating that the ban of OCPs has facilitated the reproductive recovery of hamsters by up to 81% contribution. Our findings suggest that the OCP ban is effective to restore reproduction of small terrestrial mammals. Integration of population biology and environmental science is essential to assess the impacts of persistent organic pollutants on ecological safety and biodiversity loss under accelerated global change. ©},

abstract={Climate change and the human activities on the environment are important drivers of biodiversity loss.Based on MaxEnt models, we studied the impacts of climate change and the human footprint on predicted range shift in the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey(Rhinopithecus roxellana), the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey(R.bieti), and the Guizhou snub-nosed monkey(R.brelichi).All three species are endemic to China.We found that areas of suitable habitat for the three snub-nosed monkey are shrinked and the elevation of the distribution area was increased from 2000 to 2050, of which suitable habitat for Guizhou snub-nosed monkey was contracted the most.And habitats of snub-nosed monkeys that are most vulnerable to human disturbance and climate change were principally located in Northeast Sichuan Province, Southwest Shaanxi Province, Northwest Hubei Province, Fanjingshan in Guizhou Province, and the western part of Yunnan Province.Human footprint index was an important factor leading to the decrease of suitable habitat area of golden snub-nosed monkey.And mean temperature of warmest Quarter, Precipitation Seasonality and Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter were the most important climatic factors leading to the decrease of suitable habitat for Sichuan snub-nosed monkey, Yunnan snub-nosed monkey and the Guizhou snub-nosed monkey.In addition, the southwestern of habitat(Sichuan snub-nosed monkey)and the central part of habitat(Yunnan snub-nosed monkey)had high connectivity.We suggest that priority management policies should be directed to protecting vulnerable areas and building a biodiversity corridor between subpopulations in areas with high connectivity.This study provides a basis for predicting the location of vulnerable habitats that require protection in order to conserve endangered animals. © 2021, Science Press.

abstract={Although biodiversity loss adversely influences a variety of ecosystem functions, how declining wild food diversity affects nutrient supplies for people is poorly understood. Here, we analyze the impact of declining biodiversity on nutrients supplied by fish using detailed information from the Peruvian Amazon, where inland fisheries provide a critical source of nutrition for many of the region's 800,000 people. We found that the impacts of biodiversity loss on nutrient supplies depended on compensation, trophic dynamics, and functional diversity. When small sedentary species compensated for declines in large migratory species, fatty acid supplies increased, while zinc and iron supplies decreased. In contrast, the probability of failing to maintain supplies or nutrient supply risk increased when species were nutritionally unique. Our results show that trait-based regulations and public health polices need to consider biodiversity's vital role in sustaining nutritional benefits for over 2 billion people dependent on wild foods across the globe.

abstract={The Amazon Basin is being degraded at unprecedented rates, yet conservation efforts have implemented protected areas to curb deforestation, leaving freshwater ecosystems vulnerable to degradation. Amazon freshwater ecosystems are largely unprotected because a terrestrial bias has limited the ability of science to affect policy. Overcoming this bias requires increasing exchange of information among stakeholders across the basin to raise awareness of threats to Amazon freshwater ecosystems and promote discussions and access to conservation solutions. To help address this need, this Special Issue collates 15 synthetic articles that advance knowledge and identify conservation solutions. Three articles highlight the importance of considering the hydrological and limnological processes that control the integrity of these freshwater ecosystems and offer new insights on how to extrapolate them across the basin. Three articles on crocodilians, aquatic mammals, and migratory fishes document threats and knowledge gaps, and identify the missing role of governments as an impediment to conservation of their populations. Three articles evaluate the multi-faceted effects of hydropower dams on fish, birds, and floodplain trees. They reinforce perceptions that dams are key environmental threats and offer guidance for improving protocols for dam site selection and impact assessment. Three articles assessing the effectiveness of protected areas to safeguard fish and aquatic invertebrates show there is an urgent need to redesign the Amazon protected area network to adequately protect freshwater biota. Three forward-looking articles show that: (i) conservation initiatives by local communities are ‘bright spots’ for freshwater conservation; (ii) microchemistry analyses of the ear bones of fishes could boost the knowledge base needed to conserve them; and (iii) strengthening the Amazon conservation framework requires a reversal of Brazil's current governmental priorities, remobilization of stakeholders, investments in capacity building, and expanding protections to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Indirect approaches such as Integrated Conservation and Development Projects (ICDP) aspire to combat biodiversity loss. Unfortunately, with increasing cases of failure, the link between poverty alleviation and conservation is now controversial. We revisited the earliest ICDP project in China after 12 years. The project area experienced increasing free-ranging livestock after 2004, which degraded the panda habitat. We collected livestock and socio-economic data using constructed household surveys and applied logit and zero-truncated Poisson models to understand the effect of ICDP. About 76% of livestock activities were in the panda habitat. Receipt of ICDP funds increased the chance of a household to become a livestock owner. The participation in ICDP also increased the numbers of both the traditional livestock — cattle by 83% — as well as the emerging type horses by 203%. Horses were encouraged for tourism and later raised for meat production. The income from alternative livelihoods such as tourism and off-farm jobs reduced the reliance on cattle but encouraged having more horses. Our results show that with the ban on logging and reduced cropland, assistance from ICDP facilitated the participants to accumulate wealth much quicker than others and to increase their livestock holdings. The immediate success in reducing reliance on certain natural resources and the community development of the short-duration projects could fail the long-term goals of conserving the endangered species habitat. Future conservation projects should either establish long-term mechanisms such as conditionality for incentives or create self-interests in conservation among the communities to cope with unexpected threats in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Wetland creation is a common conservation practice to mitigate biodiversity loss, caused by global wetland destruction. Despite this, there is a lack of large-scale evaluations of how created wetland characteristics and landscape context relate to bird diversity and reproductive success. We inventoried 89 created wetlands (0.2–20 ha) in central Sweden to investigate which local and landscape components were associated with breeding wetland bird species richness, pair abundance and reproductive success. Wetland size was positively associated with species richness, pair abundance and chick abundance. However, several small (1 ha) wetlands taken together were similar to or exceeded individual large wetlands of similar total wetland area, in terms of species richness, pair abundance, and chicks produced. While species richness showed a clear negative relationship with the proportion of the adjacent 50 m buffer composed of forest, pair abundance was positively related to the proportion of flooded grassland area and negatively related to the proportion of emergent water vegetation. Reproductive success measures showed no clear relationships to local habitat characteristics but tended to increase with a decreasing forest at the landscape scale. Our results suggest that breeding wetland bird populations could benefit from creating wetlands with a high flooded area, continuous management to minimise both the area of emergent water vegetation and the establishment of shrubs and trees in the immediate surroundings. We also suggest a practice of creating mainly small wetlands with a few larger ones to facilitate breeding wetland bird communities at the regional scale (gamma diversity). © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={A large component of the anthropogenic biodiversity crisis is the loss of animal species. In response, there has been significant investment in reintroductions of species to their historical ranges. Predation by native and exotic predators, however, remains a barrier to success. Over the past 200 years, Australia has seen the highest rate of mammal extinction on earth, with mammals within a critical weight range (CWR: 35 g–5.5 kg) most affected due to predation by exotic predators. Populations of some threatened species now exist only in Tasmania, offshore islands, or predator-proof sanctuaries. The next critical step is to return native populations outside of predator-free areas, ‘beyond-the-fence’, on the continental mainland. Given our current inability to completely remove exotic predators from mainland ecosystems, how can we achieve successful mammal reintroductions? A potential solution is to drive adaptation of reintroduced animals towards predator-resistance by exposing them to low levels of predation. We propose the concept of a ‘Goldilocks Zone’—the ‘just right’ levels of predation needed to drive selection for predator-resistant native species, while ensuring population viability. We experimentally reintroduced a mammal, the eastern bettong (Bettongia gaimardi), to mainland Australia, 100 years after its local extinction. Using an intense baiting regime, we reduced the population density of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), the main factor behind the eastern bettong’s extirpation from the continent. Reducing bait take to 15% of previous levels allowed differential survival among bettongs; some surviving under 100 days and others over 450 (~ 4 times longer than some similar trials with related species). Surviving individuals were generally larger at release than those that died earlier, implying selection for larger bettongs. Our results suggest that reducing predation could establish a Goldilocks Zone that could drive selection for bettongs with predator-resistant traits. Our work contributes to a growing body of literature that explores a shift towards harnessing evolutionary principles to combat the challenges posed by animal management and conservation. © 2021, Crown.},

abstract={Context: Habitat loss is widely recognized as the main driver of biodiversity loss around the globe, yet the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity have been extensively debated in recent years. Objectives: We used a robust dataset of medium and large-sized mammals to test (a) the Habitat Amount Hypothesis, which postulates that species richness can be mainly predicted by the total amount of habitat surrounding the sampling site, and (b) the effects of habitat fragmentation per se, which may be expected to be weak or mainly positive on species richness. Methods: We compiled information on the occurrence of mammal species in 166 forest fragments across the Atlantic Forest. For each forest fragment, we extracted information on patch size, percentage of forest cover (a proxy for habitat amount), and edge density and number of fragments (fragmentation metrics). We related these metrics to mammalian richness considering separately for all species, forest-dependent species, disturbance-tolerant species, and different trophic guilds. Results: All richness measures strongly declined with decreasing forest cover, yet were unaffected by patch size, number of patches and edge density. The only exception occurred with herbivore richness, which was affected by number of patches. However, we found fragmentation per se effects only for herbivore richness. Conclusions: Our results show that mammal richness increased with habitat amount at the landscape, whereas habitat fragmentation per se had significant negative impacts on herbivores only. We therefore recommend maintaining highly forested landscapes and restoring severely deforested areas, being essential for ensuring high richness of mammals. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Urban greenspace has gained considerable attention during the last decades because of its relevance to wildlife conservation, human welfare, and climate change adaptation. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation worldwide require the formation of new concepts of ecological restoration and rehabilitation aimed at improving ecosystem functions, services, and biodiversity conservation in cities. Although relict sites of natural and semi-natural ecosystems can be found in urban areas, environmental conditions and species composition of most urban ecosystems are highly modified, inducing the development of novel and hybrid ecosystems. A consequence of this ecological novelty is the lack of (semi-) natural reference systems available for defining restoration targets and assessing restoration success in urban areas. This hampers the implementation of ecological restoration in cities. In consideration of these challenges, we present a new conceptual framework that provides guidance and support for urban ecological restoration and rehabilitation by formulating restoration targets for different levels of ecological novelty (i.e., historic, hybrid, and novel ecosystems). To facilitate the restoration and rehabilitation of novel urban ecosystems, we recommend using established species-rich and well-functioning urban ecosystems as reference. Such urban reference systems are likely to be present in many cities. Highlighting their value in comparison to degraded ecosystems can stimulate and guide restoration initiatives. As urban restoration approaches must consider local history and site conditions, as well as citizens’ needs, it may also be advisable to focus the restoration of strongly altered urban ecosystems on selected ecosystem functions, services and/or biodiversity values. Ecosystem restoration and rehabilitation in cities can be either relatively inexpensive or costly, but even expensive measures can pay off when they effectively improve ecosystem services such as climate change mitigation or recreation. Successful re-shaping and re-thinking of urban greenspace by involving citizens and other stakeholders will help to make our cities more sustainable in the future. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Aim: Forest fragmentation is a major driver of biodiversity loss causing declines in species richness and functional diversity of biotic communities. Bats are essential components of ecosystems and are useful bio-indicators of habitat disturbance, yet the response and vulnerability of bats to fragmentation have been poorly studied in Africa. We aim to assess the effects of forest biogeographical history and fragmentation on functional diversity of bats and their functional traits. Location: Eastern Cape and southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Taxon: Insectivorous bats. Methods: We surveyed forest-utilizing bats to derive four functional diversity indices. Generalized linear models were used to assess the response of diversity indices to biogeographical history and fragmentation, represented by forest type and five landscape fragmentation metrics. RLQ and fourth-corner analysis were used to investigate the interaction of traits with fragmentation metrics and forest type. Results: Pondoland Scarp forests displayed high functional richness, while Eastern Cape Dune forests exhibited high functional divergence yet low functional richness and dispersion. Two fragmentation metrics affected functional diversity dynamically: edge density had a positive effect on functional evenness; and dispersion was negatively affected by river length through forests. Results showed stronger interactions of functional traits with forest type than fragmentation metrics, with filtering effects on body size and wing morphology. Main conclusions: The large-scale processes related to biogeographical history, and associated forest structure, are important determinants of functional richness, divergence and dispersion of insectivorous bat communities. Scarp forests showed the highest species and functional richness as they experienced less extreme climatic extinction filtering than Mistbelt forests during the Last Glacial Maximum, whereas the low diversity of Eastern Cape Dune forests results from their younger evolutionary history and homogenous vegetation structure. Little is known of the sensitivity of bats to habitat fragmentation in Africa: here, we show larger-sized insectivorous species; and species exhibiting low wing loading may be more vulnerable to fragmentation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Agriculture has been identified as one of the largest contributors to the current global biodiversity crisis. Amphibians are declining worldwide, and the loss of habitat and water contamination related to agricultural land uses have been suggested as the main drivers of this phenomenon. In central Argentina, the Pampean Region combines the highest rates of grassland replacement of South America, the lowest percentage of protected areas of the country, and the lack of studies exploring diversity patterns of native amphibians occurring in agroecosystems. To fill these gaps, we surveyed anuran (frogs and toads) assemblages from 342 breeding ponds located in three ecological units from central Argentina (Rolling, Flooding, and Inland Pampas) during three breeding seasons (2015–2018). We aimed to evaluate the importance of breeding habitat characteristics (ponds) and the surrounding landscape features as drivers of anuran diversity occurring in agricultural landscapes under the primary land uses of the region (cattle grazing and soybean cropping). We tested for the effects of breeding habitat characteristics and landscape features on anuran richness, abundance, and individual species occurrence, using GLMM models and information-theoretic procedures. Results indicated that species richness and total abundances were differently influenced by the habitat and landscape features across the ecological units. Overall, vegetation cover of the ponds and land use were the most important variables influencing richness and anuran abundance. The positive influence of pond vegetation cover on anuran assemblages was registered for all the ecological units, while different patterns emerged when we analyzed the effects of land use surrounding the ponds. Land use expressed as the percentage of soy crop surrounding the ponds negatively affected richness and abundance of anurans of the Flooding Pampas, but the inverse relation was found for assemblages occurring in the Inland Pampas. Moreover, multiple competing models suggested a positive correlation between anuran diversity and land-use heterogeneity, and pond density. The differential responses of anuran assemblages among the ecological units can be related to a combination of several factors encompassing regional soil characteristics (i.e., soil texture), land-use intensity as well as requirements of anuran species. We discussed the particularities of each ecological unit in order to recognize those conservation efforts that will favor anuran diversity in these altered landscapes and further contribute to achieving agricultural sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Policies aiming at improving biodiversity often consist of costly agri-environmental schemes, i.e. subsidized grazing or mowing of semi-natural areas. However, these practices have widely been found to be insufficient to mitigate biodiversity loss. Rewilding, i.e. restoring natural processes in self-sustaining biodiverse ecosystems, has been proposed as an alternative and is hypothesized to be a more cost-efficient approach to promote biodiversity conservation. Rewilding requires the availability of large natural areas which are not allocated for farming, forestry, and infrastructure to avoid potential conflicts over the use of the area. We perform an ex-ante private cost–benefit analysis of the establishment of four large nature reserves for rewilding in Denmark. We analyse the economic effects of changing from summer grazing in nature areas in combination with cultivated fields and forestry to the establishment of nature reserves in four case areas. We consider two scenarios involving conversion of agriculture and forestry areas into natural areas in combination with either extensive year-round cattle grazing or rewilding with wild large herbivores. In two case areas, it appears possible to establish large nature areas without incurring extra costs. Additionally, rewilding further reduces costs compared to year-round cattle grazing. Two opposing effects were dominant: increased economic rent occurred from the shift from summer grazing to year-round grazing or rewilding, while cessation of agriculture and forestry caused opportunity costs. © 2020, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={The continued loss, fragmentation, and degradation of forest habitats are driving an extinction crisis for tropical and subtropical bird species. This loss is particularly acute in the Atlantic Forest of South America, where it is unclear whether several endemic bird species are extinct or extant. We collate and model spatiotemporal distributional data for one such “lost” species, the Purple-winged Ground Dove Paraclaravis geoffroyi, a Critically Endangered endemic of the Atlantic Forest biome, which is nomadic and apparently dependent on masting bamboo stands. We compared its patterns of occurrence with that of a rare “control” forest pigeon, the Violaceous Quail-Dove Geotrygon violacea, which occurs in regional sympatry. We also solicit information from aviculturists who formerly kept the species. We find that the two species share a similar historical recording rate but can find no documentary evidence (i.e., specimens, photos, video, sound recordings) for the persistence of Purple-winged Ground Dove in the wild after the 1980s, despite periodic sighting records, and after which time citizen scientists frequently documented the control species in the wild. Assessments of the probability that the species is extant are sensitive to the method of analysis, and whether records lacking documentary evidence are considered credible. Analysis of the temporal sequence of past records reveals the extent of the historical range contraction of the Purple-winged Ground Dove, while our species distribution model highlights the geographic search priorities for field ornithologists hoping to rediscover the species—aided by the first recording of the species vocalizations which we obtained from interviews with aviculturists. Our interviews also revealed that the species persisted in captivity from the 1970s until the 1990s (up to 150 birds), until a law was passed obstructing captive breeding efforts by private individuals, putting an end to perhaps the best chance we had to save the species from extinction. © Copyright © 2021 Lees, Devenish, Areta, de Araújo, Keller, Phalan and Silveira.},

abstract={Although we are currently experiencing worldwide biodiversity loss, local species richness does not always decline under anthropogenic pressure. This conservation paradox may also apply in protected areas but has not yet received conclusive evidence in marine ecosystems. Here, we survey fish assemblages in six Mediterranean no-take reserves and their adjacent fishing grounds using environmental DNA (eDNA) while controlling for environmental conditions. We detect less fish species in marine reserves than in nearby fished areas. The paradoxical gradient in species richness is accompanied by a marked change in fish species composition under different managements. This dissimilarity is mainly driven by species that are often overlooked by classical visual surveys but detected with eDNA: cryptobenthic, pelagic, and rare fishes. These results do not negate the importance of reserves in protecting biodiversity but shed new light on how under-represented species groups can positively react to fishing pressure and how conservation efforts can shape regional biodiversity patterns. © 2021 The Author(s).},

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has brought humanity's strained relationship with nature into sharp focus, with calls for cessation of wild meat trade and consumption, to protect public health and biodiversity.1,2 However, the importance of wild meat for human nutrition, and its tele-couplings to other food production systems, mean that the complete removal of wild meat from diets and markets would represent a shock to global food systems.3–6 The negative consequences of this shock deserve consideration in policy responses to COVID-19. We demonstrate that the sudden policy-induced loss of wild meat from food systems could have negative consequences for people and nature. Loss of wild meat from diets could lead to food insecurity, due to reduced protein and nutrition, and/or drive land-use change to replace lost nutrients with animal agriculture, which could increase biodiversity loss and emerging infectious disease risk. We estimate the magnitude of these consequences for 83 countries, and qualitatively explore how prohibitions might play out in 10 case study places. Results indicate that risks are greatest for food-insecure developing nations, where feasible, sustainable, and socially desirable wild meat alternatives are limited. Some developed nations would also face shocks, and while high-capacity food systems could more easily adapt, certain places and people would be disproportionately impacted. We urge decision-makers to consider potential unintended consequences of policy-induced shocks amidst COVID-19; and take holistic approach to wildlife trade interventions, which acknowledge the interconnectivity of global food systems and nature, and include safeguards for vulnerable people. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Interspecific germline chimerism mediated by transplantation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) of wild species to domestic hosts promises the conservation of wild birds. Cryopreservation of avian eggs and embryos is impracticable, and currently only frozen PGCs enable conservation of both the male and female descendants. Purebred offspring have been obtained from germline chimeras of wild avian species, proving the feasibility of such technology. In vitro propagation has been optimized for avian PGCs of domestic species; however, evidence is rather limited for successful isolation as well as long-term culture from a single embryo of wild species. With accelerating biodiversity loss, we have committed to preserving current genetic resources by freezing PGCs isolated from individual embryos in addition to their genetic material. We have devised a reliable protocol for the isolation and proliferation of PGCs from wild fowls in the family Phasianidae that are conserved in captive breeding (red junglefowl, bar-tailed pheasant, kalij pheasant, Siamese fireback pheasant, and silver pheasant). We obtained individual isolates of cultured circulating PGCs (49.7%, 79/155) as well as tissue PGCs (92.9%, 144/155). The specific co-culture conditions of autologous embryonic cells, without additional growth factors, facilitated the proliferation of so-called tissue PGCs (the remaining PGCs in embryonic tissue following blood aspiration). Only circulating PGCs left in blood vessels and of PGCs migrating to developing gonads have been previously reported. However, the present study is the first to report on the harvest of ectopic PGCs. The defined conditions sustained continuous proliferation of tissue PGCs for at least six months and maintained PGC identity following cryopreservation. Cultured tissue PGCs of these wild species were extensively characterized for their expression of the germ cell-specific proteins, chicken vasa homolog (CVH) and deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL), as well as the ability to colonize chicken embryonic gonads. The novel protocol is practical for generating enough PGCs for cryopreservation, transplantation, and additionally, it enables isolation of PGCs from both blood circulation and embryonic tissue simultaneously. For conservation purposes, this approach is potentially applicable more widely to other non-domestic birds than those in the family Phasianidae that were investigated in the present study. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) encourage nations to substantially increase food production to achieve zero hunger (SDG 2) while preserving life on land (SDG 15). A key question is how to reconcile these potentially competing goals spatially. We use integer linear programming to develop an ‘integrated land use planning framework’ that identifies the optimal allocation of 17 crops under different hypothetical conservation targets while meeting agricultural demands by 2030. Intensifying existing cropland to maximum yield before allocating new cropland would reduce land requirement by 43% versus cropland expansion without intensification. Even with yield gap closure, tropical and sub-tropical crops still require expansion, primarily allocated to Venezuela, eastern Brazil, Congo Basin, Myanmar and Indonesia. Enforcement of protected areas, via avoiding conversion in 75% of Key Biodiversity Areas and 65% of intact areas, is vital to attain biodiversity targets but bears large opportunity costs, with agricultural rents dropping from $4.1 to $2.8 trillion. Although nationally constrained forest conservation efforts would earn 9% less agricultural rents compared to globally coordinated conservation solutions, they were also able to reduce intact habitat and forest loss (43% and 35% reduction). Our results demonstrate that careful choice of the allocation of future cropland expansion, could dramatically reduce—but not eliminate—the tradeoffs between the SDGs for food production and land biodiversity conservation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Global targets to halt biodiversity losses and mitigate climate change will require protecting rainforest beyond current protected area networks, necessitating responsible forest stewardship from a diverse range of companies, communities and private individuals. Robust assessments of forest condition are critical for successful forest management, but many existing techniques are highly technical, time-consuming, expensive or require specialist knowledge. To make assessment of tropical forests accessible to a wide range of actors, many of whom may be limited by resources or expertise, the High Conservation Value Resource Network (HCVRN), with the SE Asia Rainforest Research Partnership (SEARRP), developed a South East Asian version of the Forest Integrity Assessment (FIA) tool as a rapid (< 1 hour) method of assessing forest condition in the field, where non-experts respond to 50 questions about characteristics of the local environment while walking a site transect. Here, we examined the effectiveness of this survey tool by conducting ∼ 1000 assessments of forest condition at 16 tropical rainforest sites with varying levels of disturbance in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We found good agreement (R-squared range: 0.50–0.78) between FIA survey scores and independent measures of forest condition, including biodiversity, vegetation structure, aboveground carbon and other key metrics of ecosystem function, indicating that the tool performed well. Although there was variation among assessor responses when surveying the same forest sites, assessors were consistent in their ranking of those sites, and prior forest knowledge had a minimal effect on the FIA scores. Revisions or further training for questions where assessors disagree, for example, on the presence of fauna at a site, could improve consistency. We conclude that the FIA survey tool is a robust method of assessing forest condition, providing a rapid and accessible means of forest conservation assessment. The FIA tool could be incorporated into management practices in a wide range of forest conservation schemes, from sustainability standards, to community forestry and restoration initiatives. The tool will enable more organizations and individuals to understand the conservation value of the forests they manage and to identify areas for targeted improvements. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Sundarban, the world biggest mangrove forest, was announced as a World Heritage in 1997 and Ramsar Site in 2007. Its 62% lies in Bangladesh (Khulna, Bagerhat, Satkhira, Pirojpur, and Barguna Regions) and 38% in India, that become a vanguard for coastal communities. This ecosystem's floral and faunal structure incorporates 334 floral, 300 birds, 120 fish, 35 reptiles, and 32 mammals species. It contributes 41% of the total forest income of Bangladesh. This paper is intended to recognize the significant reasons for biodiversity calamity and its related effects on lives and degradation of the environment. A total of 105 published articles and reports were identified by searching four keywords: Degradation, biodiversity, Sundarban, and Bangladesh. By considering the scope, 28 articles and 17 reports were incorporated to satisfy the objectives. The study revealed that the prominent causes of biodiversity loss of Sundarban might be due to intensified shrimp cultivation, increased dependency on forest and illicit felling, changing land use pattern, oil spillage, and pollution, forest fire, improper management practices, plant diseases, tourism activities, upstream withdrawal of river water, salinity intrusion, climate change, and some natural causes. The impacts were the loss of diversity of floral and faunal species subjected to regionally extinct, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, near threatened, and least concern condition. Occupational change and deterioration of the quality of life of surrounding communities are identified as impacts. Finally, the study recommended the formulation of a special mangrove forest policy and proper management practices of Sundarban with several environmental protection strategies that should be adopted to conserve this unique ecosystem. © 2021 IJFR.},

abstract={Conservationists often assume that connection with and caring about nature's well-being is strongly linked to ecological knowledge. Existing evidence on the link between ecological knowledge and psychological nature connection is mixed, geographically limited to countries in the Global North, and does not scrutinise potential differences in determinants of ecological knowledge and nature connection. We investigate the relationship between psychological nature connection and ecological knowledge of local bird species, and assess their associations with potential drivers, including access to, contact with, and reliance on nature and socio-demographic characteristics. Our study is carried among a novel participant population of colonist farmers living along a major deforestation frontier in the Brazilian Amazon. Our study context has high conservation relevance and provides an ideal setting to assess the extent to which conservation psychology's insights from the Global North hold true elsewhere. Tropical farm-forest frontiers suffer from intense habitat and biodiversity loss, and farmers with migrant origins are important yet rarely studied conservation stakeholders. Importantly, farmers' experiences of nature are likely to vary considerably due to the wide range of socio-demographic, economic, geographical and cultural diversity. Interviewees scored highly on two indices of nature connection, but scores were higher among older people and those with greater contact with nature. Bird identification knowledge was generally low to moderate, and higher among men and younger people. Species more frequently recognised were regionally common, larger-bodied or associated with non-forest habitats. Ecological knowledge of birds and nature connection were not correlated, and they did not have any predictors in common. Our results indicate that colonist farmers are capable of forming strong connections with nature, even if they rarely possess detailed knowledge of local forest biodiversity. Considering the complex and apparently context-dependent relationship between knowing and caring about nature, it is unwise to assume that changing one would automatically affect the other.

abstract={Habitat loss and fragmentation can be long-term processes driving extinction debts, especially in cities. Because of a lack of temporal data, long-term impacts are generally investigated less frequently than short-term impacts. However, these effects are equally important for understanding biodiversity loss. We developed a Bayesian Island Biogeography model combining historical imagery and current species distribution to investigate the long-term impacts of urbanization-induced habitat loss and isolation on birds. We surveyed 101 bird species in 43 urban forest patches in a South American city with different combinations of size, isolation, and time since the last abrupt change in area. Based on the current and historical landscape configuration, we estimated the temporal dynamics between species extinction rate and area, and between immigration rate and isolation. Additionally, we used model parameters to forecast bird extinction debts. Large patches had lower extinction rates than small patches, and immigration rates were lower in more isolated patches. Furthermore, current bird species richness was better explained by current landscape configuration than by past configuration, suggesting that birds rapidly respond to changes in urban landscapes and there are no apparent extinction debts. Indeed, we found that habitat loss reduces species diversity to a new equilibrium in relatively short period (less than 10 years), and model projections indicate that bird richness will remain similar to the present if patch area is maintained. Habitat loss is the most important cause of species local extinctions in urban areas, and tropical cities could rapidly promote biodiversity by restoring forest cover. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Although threats to global biodiversity are well known, slowing current rates of biodiversity loss remains a challenge. The Aichi targets set out 20 goals on which the international community should act to alleviate biodiversity decline, 1 of which (Target 1) aims to raise public awareness of the importance of biodiversity. Although conventional indicators for Target 1 are of low spatial and temporal coverage, conservation culturomics metrics show how biodiversity awareness can be quantified at the global scale. Following methods used for the Living Planet Index, we devised a species awareness index (SAI) to measure change in species awareness based on Wikipedia views. We calculated this index at the page level for 41,197 species listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) across 10 Wikipedia languages and >2 billion views from 1 July 2015 to 30 March 2020. Bootstrapped indices for the page-level SAI showed that overall awareness of biodiversity increased marginally over time, although there were differences among taxonomic classes and languages. Among taxonomic classes, overall awareness increased fastest for reptiles and slowest for amphibians. Among languages, overall species awareness increased fastest for Japanese and slowest for Chinese and German users. Although awareness of species as a whole increased and was significantly higher for traded species, from January 2016 through January 2020, change in awareness appeared not to be strongly related to whether the species is traded or is a pollinator. As a data source for public biodiversity awareness, the SAI could be integrated into the Conservation International Biodiversity Engagement Indicator. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Biodiversity losses in the face of climate change are among the most important issues facing humanity today. Vertebrate extinction is at an all-time high, and losses of reptiles are no exception. The turtles are a unique vertebrate group of grave conservation concern. I compared recent declines in turtle biodiversity to the losses of Testudinata (Cryptodira + Pleurodira) and non-dinosaurian reptiles during the most recent mass extinction. Fuzzy arithmetic was used because of its suitability to deal with uncertainty in these kinds of data sets and the questions that arise with comparing geological data with those from recent times. This revealed that extinctions of turtles in modern times massively exceed losses observed at the Cretaceous–Paleogene border. Further, if turtle extinctions continued at their current level, massive losses of these charismatic animals could occur within our lifetime and loss of the entire group could occur in just a few centuries. We must ask ourselves, how much more can we lose before we also disappear. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The global amphibian extinction crisis has challenged scientists around the globe for decades. Robust long-term time-series data to detect such population declines are key to understanding how species respond to climatic variations. Thus, we assessed the species' richness and abundance of an anuran assemblage in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, where average temperatures were rising over the last 30 years. A series of models were applied to a long time-series of amphibian standardized monitoring (2010–2019) to assess the impact of a combination of a series of local climatic factors, and species life-history traits, to detect any variation on species abundance and richness. We observed a significant reduction in species abundance and a trend of reduction in species richness over time. Temperature had a stronger influence on species abundance and richness compared to precipitation. Furthermore, the most resilient species were generalist and peri-anthropic ones. Although more robust data is needed to pinpoint climate change-related variation on species decline, anticipating amphibian sensitivity to climate shift, and the limited time to act, our results are concerning. We suggest further studies to evaluate other aspects that could be influencing this local population decline and highlights that a broader amphibian monitoring program should be implemented in the Atlantic forest to detect other equally silent gradual declines. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Invasive species are one of the main causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. As introduced, populations increase in abundance and geographical range, so does the potential for negative impacts on native communities. As such, there is a need to better understand the processes driving range expansion as species become established in recipient landscapes. Through an investigation into capacity for population growth and range expansion of introduced populations of a non-native lizard (Podarcis muralis), we aimed to demonstrate how multi-scale factors influence spatial spread, population growth, and invasion potential in introduced species. We collated location records of P. muralis presence in England, UK through data collected from field surveys and a citizen science campaign. We used these data as input for presence-background models to predict areas of climate suitability at a national-scale (5 km resolution), and fine-scale habitat suitability at the local scale (2 m resolution). We then integrated local models into an individual-based modeling platform to simulate population dynamics and forecast range expansion for 10 populations in heterogeneous landscapes. National-scale models indicated climate suitability has restricted the species to the southern parts of the UK, primarily by a latitudinal cline in overwintering conditions. Patterns of population growth and range expansion were related to differences in local landscape configuration and heterogeneity. Growth curves suggest populations could be in the early stages of exponential growth. However, annual rates of range expansion are predicted to be low (5–16 m). We conclude that extensive nationwide range expansion through secondary introduction is likely to be restricted by currently unsuitable climate beyond southern regions of the UK. However, exponential growth of local populations in habitats providing transport pathways is likely to increase opportunities for regional expansion. The broad habitat niche of P. muralis, coupled with configuration of habitat patches in the landscape, allows populations to increase locally with minimal dispersal. © 2021 The Authors.

This review reveals that, globally, invasive species threaten 14% (28% on islands) of critically endangered terrestrial vertebrate species (birds, mammals and reptiles), with critically endangered birds (25%; 47% on islands) the most affected, threatened predominantly by a few invasive mammal predators (mainly rodents and feral cat). The chytrid fungal pathogen is the main threat for critically endangered amphibians. The control and management of the invasive species identified in this study should be a high priority for global biological conservation, thereby contributing towards the achievement of the goals of the Post-2020 Framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Further research on the impacts of invasive species and interactions with other drivers will be essential for the conservation of highly threatened species. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Collaborative monitoring over broad scales and levels of ecological organization can inform conservation efforts necessary to address the contemporary biodiversity crisis. An important challenge to collaborative monitoring is motivating local engagement with enough buy-in from stakeholders while providing adequate top-down direction for scientific rigor, quality control, and coordination. Collaborative monitoring must reconcile this inherent tension between top-down control and bottom-up engagement. Highly mobile and cryptic taxa, such as bats, present a particularly acute challenge. Given their scale of movement, complex life histories, and rapidly expanding threats, understanding population trends of bats requires coordinated broad-scale collaborative monitoring. The North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) reconciles top-down, bottom-up tension with a hierarchical master sample survey design, integrated data analysis, dynamic data curation, regional monitoring hubs, and knowledge delivery through web-based infrastructure. NABat supports collaborative monitoring across spatial and organizational scales and the full annual lifecycle of bats. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Agricultural intensification seriously threatens European biodiversity. To mitigate this threat, farmland habitat suitability should be improved. Mid-field woodlots surrounded by intensively cultivated fields or grasslands, represent one of the promising tools for such improvement. However, woodlots can be dominated by non-native plants and their impacts on woodlot function as refugees for biodiversity remains unclear. Therefore, we studied the impact of the invasive black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) on bird species richness in woodlots in intensively cultivated Central European farmland. We surveyed 27 mid-field woodlots (13 covered by native vegetation and 14 dominated by black locust) in the Czech Republic, relating the species richness of all birds, habitat specialists and habitat generalists to woodlot characteristics: black locust occurrence, distance to the main forest, age of the woodlot, vegetation structure, arthropod biomass (representing food supply for birds), surrounding habitats and type of crops in which they are embedded. Our results suggest that the woodlots covered by the black locust had lower species richness of all birds, habitat specialists and habitat generalists than the woodlots covered by native tree species. The negative impact of the invasive woody plant on birds was likely driven by changes in vegetation structure since such woodlots had lower coverage of the shrub layer and less continuous canopy. This mechanism was particularly supported in habitat generalists, whereas habitat specialists additionally showed positive relationships to the other vegetation characteristics (namely the coverage of herbs in the ground layer and the proportion of medium-sized trees). Our study shows that even though mid-field woodlots host numerous bird species, their role in the delivery of conservation benefits for breeding birds is compromised if non-native woody plants dominate the vegetation. Therefore, from the perspective of breeding birds’ conservation, the native woody plant species should be used for woodlot establishment. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Context: Socioecological information should be properly employed in the process of spatial analysis, planning, and management in order to respond to complex and multidirectional biodiversity issues. Objectives: We conducted this study to map socioecological hotspots, where landscapes of social significance and wildlife habitats overlap, show to what extent and how the spatial distribution of social values (SVs) of people toward their landscapes interact with wildlife habitats in socioecological hotspots, simulate the potential for habitat degradation as a result of human activities linked to SVs, identify strategic areas for landscape restoration in socioecological hotspots, where both environmental conditions and SVs support the persistence and colonization of wildlife, and detect specific areas, where SVs of people may be contradictive leading to land-use disputes. Methods: We developed a model to show the potential for habitat degradation based on the spatial distribution of SVs associated with landscapes. We restricted our study to the Upper Missouri River Basin (UMRB) and focused on habitats of five keystone mammal species to assess the validity of our model. Results: Habitat loss, habitat subdivision, habitat dispersion, and habitat shrinkage can be four consequences of human activities for biodiversity in socioecological hotspots of the UMRB, however, the magnitude of impacts varies among landscapes and mammal species. Conclusion: Spatially explicit models to properly map SVs in relation to wildlife habitats are still associated with some uncertainties and limitations, and therefore, require further development. Change in SVs and public attitudes toward land use is essential to avoid further biodiversity loss in this region. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Human-caused loss of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, defaunation, is increasing, and potentially affects plant community structure of diverse grassland ecosystems world-wide. We experimentally simulated defaunation using size-selective fences to progressively exclude large-, medium- and small-sized mammals, and invertebrates from two subalpine vegetation types in the Swiss National Park (SNP): intensively grazed short-grass and moderately grazed tall-grass vegetation. We assessed plant community properties yearly from 2009 to 2013, and examined treatment effects on plant community structure in the two grassland types. In the short-grass vegetation, the exclusion of large mammals increased total plant biomass, while the exclusion of large and medium-sized mammals increased total, grass and forb biomass compared to when all animals had access. These increases became stronger when invertebrates were also excluded. The exclusion of all mammals and invertebrates increased biomass of grasses by 205%, forbs by 100% and total plant biomass by 118% compared to when all animals had access, hence enhancing relative biomass of grasses from 43.6% to 60%, changing plant species composition and lowering richness of forbs by 16%, the number of plant families by 13% and family-level Shannon diversity by 23%. In contrast to these significant community-level responses found in the short-grass vegetation, there was no evidence that the size-selective exclusion of animals altered the plant community structure of the tall-grass vegetation. The contrasting results were due to the difference in plant community composition prior to our experiment, which were related to differences in quantity and quality of forage and in grazing intensities of herbivores between the two grassland types. Synthesis. Our results showed that different-sized animals, in particular large mammals and invertebrates, contributed to maintain the plant community structure in the short-grass vegetation, highlighting the importance of multiple, functionally different animal groups for ecosystem functioning and stability. In contrast to the short-grass vegetation, we could not detect such a top-down control by animals in the tall-grass vegetation. Our results suggest that potential defaunation effects on grassland plant community structure depend on the degree of grazing pressure release and grassland vegetation type. © 2021 British Ecological Society},

abstract={Deep-sea regions provide vast ecosystem services such as biological habitat and nutrient cycling. Even though being threatened by climate change and facing possible biodiversity loss, these deep-sea ecosystems are poorly understood. So are macrobenthic communities and their functions within these ecosystems. Biodiversity and ecosystem function relationships as well as their link to environmental drivers can be assessed with the biological trait analysis. We used this approach for the first time for macrofauna assemblages across the deep Fram Strait between Greenland and Svalbard (1000–5500 m water depth) to evaluate their community-specific function from the upper continental slope down to the deepest known Arctic depression, the Molloy Deep. We aimed to investigate whether there are changes in benthic functioning along the bathymetric gradient and if so, which environmental stressors may drive these changes. In total, 16 stations were sampled with a giant box corer (0.25 m2) in 2016 and 2018. Sediments were sieved through a 0.5 mm mesh size sieve and fauna was identified to lowest possible taxonomic entity. Functions of species were characterized by using six traits split in 24 modalities gathered in a fuzzy coded species × traits array. Environmental parameters shaping the benthic habitat and reflecting food availability were gathered from remote sensing, mooring deployments, and sediment sampling. A distance-based redundancy analysis indicated near-bottom water temperature, seabed inclination, water depth as well as phytodetritial matter at the sea surface and seafloor (indicating food availability) to be the best variables explaining the trait and station distribution. Stations clustered into three groups based on their trait composition. Shallower stations characterized by high chlorophyll a concentration with large organisms, living within the sediment as well as predating specimens clustered in one group. A second group was characterized by stations with low chlorophyll a concentration and medium-sized, suspension feeding, epifaunal living macrofauna. A third group comprised stations with water depths ≥ 3000 m and was dominated by medium sized, surface deposit feeding and infaunal living specimens. Overall, the functional structure of macrofauna communities in the Fram Strait followed a food availability-driven gradient. Based on the relationship between sea ice, surface water primary production and food availability at the seafloor, these results point to macrobenthos being sensible to predicted anthropogenically generated environmental variations in polar regions. Alterations in benthic ecosystem functions might be expected when environmental conditions change. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Hydrological disconnection is increasingly threatening biodiversity in river floodplain ecosystems worldwide, but studies reporting long-term change of aquatic biodiversity in relation to floodplain disconnection are seldom, especially from multifaceted biodiversity perspectives. Here, we examined how loss of river-lake connectivity affected multifaceted (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic) alpha and beta diversity of fish assemblages in 11 Yangtze River floodplain lakes over the past 70 years. We found that all three facets of alpha diversity significantly decreased through time, but the decrease rate was highest (31.4%) in taxonomic richness, second in functional (26.4%) and lowest in phylogenetic facet (4.7%). Nevertheless, taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic structures of fish fauna all exhibited differentiation. The taxonomic and phylogenetic differentiations were due to the joint increases in their turnover and nestedness-resultant component, whereas the functional differentiation was mainly driven by the increase in its turnover component. Such distinct results were because of the imbalanced extirpations of fish species (especially from species-poor orders and families) in disconnected lakes and connected lakes. With few exceptions of strong correlations between changes in taxonomic dissimilarities and phylogenetic dissimilarities, we generally found weak correlations between changes in different facets of both alpha and beta diversity. This discrepancy highlights that measuring different biodiversity facets offer distinct information about biodiversity dynamics and can enhance our ability to detect and evaluate the impacts of floodplain disconnection on biodiversity. We therefore recommend an integrative approach embracing taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity is essential to effective biodiversity assessment and conservation in large river floodplains. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Global biodiversity loss is indicative of the massive influence of human activity that defines the Anthropocene. Some scholars argue that changes in behaviour at the scale necessary to address this crisis will require wholesale change in cultural values. However, evidence is lacking on whether values are shifting. To better understand this phenomenon, we analysed long-term, large-scale trend data regarding wildlife values in the United States, collected through a 19-state survey in 2004 (n = 12,673) and 2017–2018 (n = 20,674). Findings confirmed an increased endorsement of mutualism values (seeing wildlife as part of one’s social community and deserving of rights like humans) accompanied by a decline in values emphasizing domination (treating wildlife as resources to be used for human benefit), a trend further visible in cross-generational cohort analysis. We also found strong associations between state-level values and trends in urbanization, connecting the shift to macro-level socioeconomic factors. Results suggest positive outcomes for conservation but the field’s ability to adapt will be critical to realizing those outcomes. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Drainage of wetlands and agricultural intensification has resulted in serious biodiversity loss in Europe, not least in grasslands. Consequently, many meadow birds have drastically declined, and the habitats they select for breeding currently rely on land management. However, the selection of habitats maintained by agriculture may contribute to reduced fitness and thus remain maladaptive for individuals, which makes conservation challenging. An understanding of the relationships between species’ habitat selection, food supply and land management in the context of species’ behaviour is therefore crucial for conservation. Lowland populations of Great Snipe Gallinago media are currently declining at a moderate rate, causing a conservation concern. We examined the daytime site selection (assumed as foraging sites) and food supply of radiotracked Great Snipe males breeding on a floodplain in NE Poland. Foraging sites were classified at micro- and macro-scale levels using the logistic regression in a use–availability design. On the micro-scale level, males selected moderate sward height and density, and a large amount of bare ground patches, and the importance of these increased as the breeding season progressed. On the macro-scale level, these conditions were associated with (1) meadows mown twice per season and grazed thereafter (associated with the most abundant food resources – earthworms) and (2) extensively managed pastures, suggesting the importance of grazing. Abandoned or late-mown meadows under agri-environmental schemes (AES) were avoided by foraging males. However, parcels with delayed mowing offer safe breeding sites for females nesting close to leks, unlike land-use types preferred by foraging males, which may act as an ecological trap. Effective conservation of Great Snipes on floodplain meadows requires precisely targeted AES schemes that will provide a mosaic of intensive and extensive land-use patches in the vicinity of identified leks. © 2020 British Ornithologists' Union},

abstract={The continued global biodiversity crisis necessitates the continuation and development of new well-designed monitoring strategies and action plans with particular focus on under-represented countries and regions. However, limited resources in terms of budget and availability of qualified field personnel can restrict the geographical coverage of monitoring efforts. Focusing monitoring efforts on a representative subset of species and locations can improve cost-efficiency. Optimal performance of multi-species indicators derived from such an approach requires objective methods for species selection and a sampling design that reduces inherent sampling bias caused by regional differences in habitat availability or accessibility. To explore the performance of a multi-species indicator across different regions within a nation, we developed a multi-species indicator (MSI) for farmland birds in Norway using objective niche-based selection of species. We compare the performance of this indicator at national and regional scales (Central and East regions) in Norway, and between urban and rural sites within regions. The seven-species indicator obtained from the species selection provided similar indicator values and trends for Norway and the Central and East regions, as well as for rural sites within the combined Central + East region. All trends were defined as showing moderate decline from 2007–2016. Urban sites within the combined Central + East region provided trend estimates that showed stronger decline than rural areas in the same region during the time span. Our results emphasize the need to control for sampling bias when structuring monitoring programmes such as a Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). This is especially important if limited resources restrict the geographical coverage of the monitoring scheme. We recommend that monitoring schemes follow a stratified random sampling design that represents both the availability of different land cover types and their distribution with regard to proximity to highly populated areas. If that is not possible, statistically weighting data from different regions or landscapes is likely to be necessary. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={In recent years, biodiversity loss has become one of the most serious environmental issues worldwide, especially in aquatic ecosystems. To avoid diversity loss, it is necessary to monitor biological communities, and environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has been developed as a rapid, noninvasive, and cost-effective method for aquatic biodiversity monitoring. Although this method has been applied to various environments and taxa, a detailed assessment of the efficient sampling methods for monitoring is still required. In this study, we explored eDNA metabarcoding sampling methods for fish at a single site to maximize the number of detected species using realistic effort in a natural, small river. We considered the following three parameters: sample type (water or sediment), sample position at a site (right and left shore and center of the river), and water volume (10–4000 mL). The results suggested that the number of detected species from sedimentary eDNA was equivalent to that from aqueous eDNA, although the species composition was different. The number of detected species could be saturated by collecting a 1000 mL water sample, regardless of sampling position within a survey site. However, sedimentary eDNA showed a spatially heterogeneous species composition between sampling positions within a survey site despite the short distance (5 m) between positions, without apparent differences in physical properties such as velocity and sediment particle distribution. By completing eDNA biodiversity monitoring of fish with 1000 mL water samples across the whole river, we detected more fish species than in previous traditional surveys conducted at the same sites. Thus, the aqueous eDNA metabarcoding method is as efficient as traditional surveys, while sedimentary eDNA metabarcoding could complement the results of aqueous eDNA metabarcoding. © 2020, The Japanese Society of Limnology.},

abstract={Though human activities are postulated to be the main drivers of the worldwide biodiversity crisis, humans are also suggested by some to be an important part of the solution to the crisis. How can such a paradox be best solved? This paradox requires an adaptive, context-specific, dynamic solution, at a fine-grained scale that varies by location. The Wild Chimpanzee Foundation (WCF) works on the ground in three West African countries: In Côte d'Ivoire, where bushmeat consumption is a recurrent and generalized threat to wildlife, WCF used live theater performances in the villages to address this issue. Post-activity evaluations revealed that the more often individuals have been part of such awareness activities, the less they will consume bushmeat. In nearby Liberia, where illegal miners have invaded many protected areas and intact forests, the WCF supports Community Watch Teams (CWT) to patrol the Sapo National Park with Forestry Development Authority staff. Within 11 months of its creation, the CWT patrols around and in the Sapo National Park resulted in thousands of illegal miners progressively leaving the national park. In Guinea, where coexistence between humans and primates has prevailed based on religious traditions, the WCF developed a strategic approach, as the Moyen-Bafing National Park contains about 5000 chimpanzees as well as some 255 villages. Therefore, we adopted an “integrated landscape approach” whereby the community activities are planned in combination with initiatives increasing forest regeneration and connectivity in high conservation value areas. Communities in northern Guinea confronted with dramatic fluctuations due to climatic changes welcomed such activities that help them become more resilient and adaptable to those alterations. In conclusion, evidence-based information at the local level helps to resolve the conservation paradox by adapting with the local communities' context-specific dynamic approaches to enhance the conservation of great apes. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Land-cover and land-use change are major drivers of global biodiversity loss. Savannas are experiencing shrub encroachment and land-use changes that affect animal communities, yet how the effects of shrub encroachment vary with land use remains unclear. We also need to determine which species traits explain the effects of shrub encroachment and land-use changes to identify potential drivers of community change and predict species' responses to conservation efforts. We sampled birds across gradients of shrub encroachment and land use (protected savanna, pastures, homestead lands, and sugarcane) in the lowveld savanna of Eswatini to: (1) test for the effects of shrub encroachment, land-use change, and their potential synergies on the occurrence of 48 species of birds; and (2) determine which species traits (those associated with nesting, foraging, or vulnerability to predation) explained species' associations with shrub encroachment and land-use change. We used Bayesian multispecies occupancy models to account for imperfect detection, interpret species responses, and understand the effects of species traits. We found evidence for community-wide synergies between shrub encroachment and land-use effects on birds that varied with species' diets. Agricultural intensification had negative effects on the occurrence of most species examined, while shrub cover typically had positive effects which were stronger in pastures and homestead lands than in protected areas. The negative effects of land-use change were greatest for insectivores and cavity nesters, whereas insectivore occurrence increased with shrub cover, collectively indicating that nesting and foraging traits best explained species responses to land-use and land-cover change in the region. Our results suggest that shrub cover management for bird conservation should vary with land use: shrubs could be thinned in protected areas without reducing bird occupancy but shrubs in homesteads should be retained. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London},

abstract={Heavily managed wildlife may suffer from genetic homogenization and reshuffling of locally adapted genotypes with non-native ones. This phenomenon often affects natural populations by reducing their evolutionary potential and speeding up the ongoing biodiversity crisis. For decades, the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), an intensively managed gamebird of conservation concern and considerable socio-economic importance, has been subjected to extensive releases of farm-reared hybrids with the chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar) and translocations irrespective of subspecific affinity. These practices have led to serious concerns that the genetic integrity and biogeographic structure of most red-legged partridge populations are irreversibly affected, as suggested by previous studies based on few genetic markers. Using over 168 000 genome-wide loci and a sampling across the entire A. rufa range, we detected unexpectedly limited and spatially uneven chukar introgression as well as significant intraspecific structure. We demonstrate that species widely feared to have irretrievably lost their genetic identity are likely to be much less affected by unsuitable management practices than previously assumed. Our results spell the need for a radical re-think on animal conservation, possibly restoring native status to populations long treated as compromised. Our study exemplifies how the application of innovative conservation-genomic methods is key to solving wildlife management problems dealing with introgressive hybridization worldwide. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Unsustainable timber management, primarily via Conventional selective Logging (CL), has resulted in severe habitat degradation and biodiversity loss. Sustainable techniques, principally Reduced Impact Logging (RIL), are therefore essential for conserving highly threatened, physiologically sensitive taxa such as amphibians. In this study we compare the effects of CL and RIL on stream amphibians across a regeneration gradient in two forest reserves in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We analysed data from a community of stream amphibians across 29 transects subject to either CL (18 – 21 years since logging) or RIL (4 – 21). Multi-species occupancy modelling determined community and species responses to logging types, regeneration times and logging associated environmental factors. Diversity profiles, which capture representative diversity indices whilst accounting for community evenness, were calculated using occupancy model results. Our results indicated that several species and community occupancy generally responded negatively to logging associated covariates (lower aboveground carbon density and higher siltation). Stream breeding species occupancy was generally lower in CL compared to RIL sites, with higher generalist breeding species occupancy in CL sites. Diversity profiles identified higher anuran diversity and evenness in RIL compared to CL sites of the same age (18 – 21 years). Furthermore, anuran diversity and evenness exhibited a distinct recovery from 4 to 21 years following RIL. Our results provide strong evidence that RIL reduces the negative impacts on stream habitats, amphibian occupancy and diversity compared to CL, and suggest a far quicker recovery after RIL. We believe RIL presents a promising alternative for sustainable tropical timber management and stream amphibian conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Tropical forests cover 7% of the earth's surface and hold 50% of known terrestrial arthropod species. Alarming insect declines resulting from human activities have recently been documented in temperate and tropical ecosystems worldwide, but reliable data from tropical forests remain sparse. The sap-sucking tribe Athysanini is one herbivore group sensitive to anthropogenic perturbation and the largest within the diverse insect family Cicadellidae distributed in America's tropical forests. To measure the possible effects of deforestation and related activities on leafhopper biodiversity, a survey of 143 historic collecting localities was conducted to determine whether species documented in the Mexican dry tropical forests during the 1920s to 1940s were still present. Biostatistical diversity analysis was performed to compare historical to recent data on species occurrences. A data matrix of 577 geographical records was analysed. In total, 374 Athysanini data records were included representing 115 species of 41 genera. Historically, species richness and diversity were higher than found in the recent survey, despite greater collecting effort in the latter. A strong trend in species decline was observed (-53%) over 75 years in this endangered seasonally dry ecosystem. Species completeness was dissimilar between historic and present data. Endemic taxa were significantly less important and represented in the 1920s-1940s species records. All localities surveyed in the dry tropical forest are disturbed and reduced by modern anthropogenic processes. Mexico harbours highly endemic leafhopper taxa with a large proportion of these inhabiting the dry forest. These findings provide important data for conservation decision making and modelling of distribution patterns of this threatened seasonally dry tropical ecosystem. © 2021 The Authors.},

abstract={Preventing extinctions requires understanding macroecological patterns of vulnerability or persistence. However, correlates of risk can be nonlinear, within-species risk varies geographically, and current-day threats cannot reveal drivers of past losses. We investigated factors that regulated survival or extinction in Caribbean mammals, which have experienced the globally highest level of human-caused postglacial mammalian extinctions, and included all extinct and extant Holocene island populations of non-volant species (219 survivals or extinctions across 118 islands). Extinction selectivity shows a statistically detectable and complex body mass effect, with survival probability decreasing for both mass extremes, indicating that intermediate-sized species have been more resilient. A strong interaction between mass and age of first human arrival provides quantitative evidence of larger mammals going extinct on the earliest islands colonized, revealing an extinction filter caused by past human activities. Survival probability increases on islands with lower mean elevation (mostly small cays acting as offshore refugia) and decreases with more frequent hurricanes, highlighting the risk of extreme weather events and rising sea levels to surviving species on low-lying cays. These findings demonstrate the interplay between intrinsic biology, regional ecology and specific local threats, providing insights for understanding drivers of biodiversity loss across island systems and fragmented habitats worldwide. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Eleven years after invasive Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) were eradicated from Hawadax Island, in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, the predicted three-level trophic cascade in the rocky intertidal, with native shorebirds as the apex predator, returned, leading to a community resembling those on rat-free islands with significant decreases in invertebrate species abundances and increases in fleshy algal cover. Rats had indirectly structured the intertidal community via their role as the apex predator in a four-level trophic cascade. Our results are an excellent example of an achievable and relatively short-term community-level recovery following removal of invasive animals. These conservation successes are especially important for islands as their disproportionately high levels of native biodiversity are excessively threatened by invasive mammals.},

abstract={How are our cities using nature‐based solutions to confront the challenges posed by a warming climate, the loss of biodiversity and major resource depletion? This article discusses the opportunities and benefits of applying the concepts of regreening and rewilding of cities. The article engages with key sources and summarizes the background and development of regreening and nature‐based solutions and important policies, concerns and perspectives of international and national organizations. It introduces the integration of nature‐based solutions (NBS) as a strategy in urban planning with the aim to strengthen urban resilience and to slow down the biodiversity de-cline. Rewilding areas in cities has become a powerful strategy to bring back butterflies, insects, birds, and wildlife. In contrast to highly managed parks and gardens, these rewilding initiatives are leaving allotted spaces mostly uncultivated and self‐regulated. Contact to nature is essential for human existence, urban wellbeing, and good quality of life. Green spaces in cities—big or small—all contribute to the health and wellbeing of residents. However, many cities do not offer residents easy access to green space within the city. Improving the better distribution of and access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks is likely to deliver a large number of benefits, such as: ecosystem services, better water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, and restoring damaged ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microcli-mate. Rewilding has emerged as an important part of new public parks and gardens. The next step is to up‐scale citywide climate intervention strategies deployed to keep cities cool. However, as the discussion of this article shows, it is essential that the design of these NBS strategies is fully integrated with other complementary planning interventions and seeks synergies across all sectors. © 2021 by the author.

abstract={Global environmental goals mandate the expansion of the protected area network to halt biodiversity loss. The European Union’s Natura 2000 network covers 27.3% of the terrestrial area of Greece, one of the highest percentages in Europe. However, the extent to which this network protects Europe’s biodiversity, especially in a biodiverse country like Greece, is unknown. Here, we overlap the country’s Natura 2000 network with the ranges of the 424 species assessed as threatened on the IUCN Red List and present in Greece. Natura 2000 overlaps on average 47.6% of the mapped range of threatened species; this overlap far exceeds that expected by random networks (21.4%). Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation (non-exclusive subsets of Natura 2000 sites) overlap 33.4% and 38.1% respectively. Crete and Peloponnese are the two regions with the highest percentage of threatened species, with Natura 2000 sites overlapping on average 62.3% with the threatened species’ ranges for the former, but only 30.6% for the latter. The Greek ranges of all 62 threatened species listed in Annexes 1 and II to the Birds and Habitats Directives are at least partially overlapped by the network (52.0%), and 18.0% of these are fully overlapped. However, the ranges of 27 threatened species, all of which are endemic to Greece, are not overlapped at all. These results can inform national policies for the protection of biodiversity beyond current Natura 2000 sites. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Tropical rainforest disturbance and conversion are critical drivers of biodiversity loss. A key knowledge gap is understanding the impacts of habitat modification on mechanisms of community assembly, which are predicted to respond differently between taxa and across spatial scales. We use a null model approach to detect trait assembly of species at local- and landscape-scales, and then subdivide communities with different habitat associations and foraging guilds to investigate whether the detection of assembly mechanisms varies between groups. We focus on two indicator taxa, dung beetles and birds, across a disturbance gradient of primary rainforest, selectively logged rainforest, and oil palm plantations in Borneo, Southeast Asia. Random community assembly was predominant for dung beetles across habitats, whereas trait convergence, indicative of environmental filtering, occurred across the disturbance gradient for birds. Assembly patterns at the two spatial scales were similar. Subdividing for habitat association and foraging guild revealed patterns hidden when focusing on the overall community. Dung beetle forest specialists and habitat generalists showed opposing assembly mechanisms in primary forest, community assembly of habitat generalists for both taxa differed with disturbance intensity, and insectivorous birds strongly influenced overall community assembly relative to other guilds. Our study reveals the sensitivity of community assembly mechanisms to anthropogenic disturbance via a shift in the relative contribution of stochastic and deterministic processes. This highlights the need for greater understanding of how habitat modification alters species interactions and the importance of incorporating species’ traits within assessments. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Recovery of Greater Sandhill Cranes (Grus canadensis tabida) is a conservation success but will increase the potential for crop damage if problems caused by high crane density remain unresolved. In spring, cranes consume planted corn kernels (Zea mays), causing significant damage. From 1999 to 2001 and 2007 to 2009 we experimented with resolving crane damage. Seeds treated with either insecticides or anthraquinone (AQ) were not consumed in planted fields while untreated seeds were, causing a 19.6% reduction in seedling density where cranes foraged. Insecticides tested were inappropriate for future use while performance of AQ mimicked that of insecticides but was environmentally acceptable and economical to use. Though cranes selected germinating corn fields, regardless of treatment, they used fields containing treated corn without causing damage. Cranes were generalists when selecting food items within a field and likely switched food items when exposed to treated corn but were specialists when selecting field types within a home range. Deterrence at geographic scales where species are generalists may reduce the chance for habituation. Subsequent deployment of AQ has been replicated with other bird species and crops at landscape scales. Successful solutions enable landowners to value wildlife and promote biological diversity found on those lands. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Assessing extinction risk from climate drivers is a major goal of conservation science. Few studies, however, include a long-term perspective of climate change. Without explicit integration, such long-term temperature trends and their interactions with short-term climate change may be so dominant that they blur or even reverse the apparent direct relationship between climate change and extinction. Here we evaluate how observed genus-level extinctions of arthropods, bivalves, cnidarians, echinoderms, foraminifera, gastropods, mammals and reptiles in the geological past can be predicted from the interaction of long-term temperature trends with short-term climate change. We compare synergistic palaeoclimate interaction (a short-term change on top of a long-term trend in the same direction) to antagonistic palaeoclimate interaction such as long-term cooling followed by short-term warming. Synergistic palaeoclimate interaction increases extinction risk by up to 40%. The memory of palaeoclimate interaction including the climate history experienced by ancestral lineages can be up to 60 Myr long. The effect size of palaeoclimate interaction is similar to other key factors such as geographic range, abundance or clade membership. Insights arising from this previously unknown driver of extinction risk might attenuate recent predictions of climate-change-induced biodiversity loss. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Context: Agricultural land use is expanding and is a major driver of the biodiversity crisis. Land use planning initiatives seeking to optimize wildlife conservation are hindered by a lack of baseline data quantifying species’ tolerance to human-modified landscapes. Objectives: We explored the influence of landscape characteristics on the fine-scale space-use patterns of a model generalist carnivore, the Malay civet (Viverra tangalunga), within degraded tropical forests and oil palm plantations. Methods: We collected over 20,000 GPS locations from 21 male civets in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo to evaluate the species’ space-use patterns and habitat utilization processes. We used movement-based modeling to determine home ranges, and combined the results with high-resolution remotely sensed habitat characteristics. We developed resource utilization functions to determine individual and population-level functional responses to proximity to plantation edge, distance to water, terrain ruggedness, forest structure, and functional diversity. Results: Civets foraged within oil palm plantations, yet all animals utilized forests. Home ranges scaled with proportion of plantation within both total and core ranges. Resource utilization functions reported individualism in the species’ responses to habitat characteristics. At the population-scale, civets consistently and more intensely used habitats closer to plantation edges and taller tree canopies. Conclusions: Although plantations did not pose an inhospitable matrix, oil palm agriculture is a less suitable habitat than remnant forests for civets. Proximity measures and forest structure influenced the spatial behaviors of this adaptable generalist, highlighting the importance of protected areas. We recommend land-sparing and -sharing approaches to facilitate carnivore persistence across oil palm degraded landscapes. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={There is a consensus that human activities affect biodiversity in pond ecosystems. However, the majority of studies have mainly focused on the direct effect of human activities on a single group, despite the fact that anthropogenically induced biodiversity loss in ecosystems occurs across multiple trophic levels and may depend on both altered habitat (e.g., water chemistry) and on trophic interactions cascading up the trophic network. In this study, we analyzed the simultaneous direct, water-chemistry mediated and trophic network cascading effects of the overall human-impact intensification on density (biomass/abundance) and richness (number of taxa) across all trophic levels in pond ecosystems. For this, we collected and combined multi-taxon data (341 taxa) for macrophytes, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic and epiphytic macroinvertebrates, and fishes. We showed that human-impact intensification affected the densities and richness of almost all trophic levels across the study ecosystems, and resulted in an overall negative effect on the multitrophic diversity of the entire community. We detected direct effect of human-impact intensification, but no indirect effects, on the richness of primary producers. In contrast, the indirect effects mediated through the nutrient content in the water were the most influential drivers of multitrophic diversity in the invertebrate communities. At the same time, the indirect effects through the trophic network cascades were detected mainly within the fish community. Our findings improve the mechanistic understanding of multitrophic diversity responses in ponds under the ongoing intensification of anthropogenic pressure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) that are applied in the planning phases of large land-use and construction projects are aimed at aiding decision-making and mitigating significant environmental impacts. In light of the global biodiversity crisis, conducting high-quality biodiversity impact assessments is important, as biodiversity information, among other factors, has the potential to influence how projects will be implemented in the end. We investigated the biodiversity and bird surveys conducted and the number of bird species of conservation concern in peat extraction and wind farm projects to which an EIA was applied to in 1995–2016 in Finland and compared whether these factors differed between the project types and between implemented and unimplemented projects. We also studied the availability of follow-up monitoring data of biodiversity impacts within the two project types. The number of nationally threatened breeding birds was significantly lower in implemented than in unimplemented peat extraction projects. The overall probability of being implemented was significantly negatively associated with the year the EIA began for both project types. All permitted peat extraction projects and 22% of wind farm projects conducted post-construction biodiversity monitoring; however, only some projects enabled before-after comparisons. Our results are in line with earlier findings that demonstrate the difficulty of showing the direct impacts of biodiversity information on EIA decision-making and to what extent it is related to project approval or rejection. The role of follow-up monitoring in the EIA and project development could also be strengthened. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Plant diversity and plant–consumer/pathogen interactions likely interact to influence ecosystem carbon fluxes but experimental evidence is scarce. We examined how experimental removal of foliar fungi, soil fungi and arthropods from experimental prairies planted with 1, 4 or 16 plant species affected instantaneous rates of carbon uptake (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Re) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Increasing plant diversity increased plant biomass, GPP and Re, but NEE remained unchanged. Removing foliar fungi increased GPP and NEE, with the greatest effects at low plant diversity. After accounting for plant biomass, we found that removing foliar fungi increased mass-specific flux rates in the low-diversity plant communities by altering plant species composition and community-wide foliar nitrogen content. However, this effect disappeared when soil fungi and arthropods were also removed, demonstrating that both plant diversity and interactions among consumer groups determine the ecosystem-scale effects of plant–fungal interactions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Agricultural intensification is one of the major factors driving biodiversity loss. However, most studies in human-dominated landscapes have used taxonomic diversity in their analysis, ignoring evolutionary relationships. Consequently, the relationship between landscape structure and phylogenetic diversity is not well understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that landscape heterogeneity is positively related to bird phylogenetic indexes of diversity and structure, leading to over-dispersed phylogenies in very heterogeneous landscapes. We analyzed phylogenetic responses in interfaces between forest edges and anthropogenic matrices (forest–pasture and forest–eucalyptus) using generalized linear mixed models. We also compared these indexes between land covers to assess which one best preserves the phylogenetic history of communities. We used both traditional phylogenetic indexes and those corrected for species richness. Our results showed that phylogenetic diversity varied significantly between land cover types, but this did not occur when we removed effects associated with species richness, suggesting that all land covers preserve similar levels of evolutionary history. Additionally, our best models showed a positive relationship between landscape heterogeneity and bird phylogenetic indexes of diversity and structure, but the strength of these relationships may be land cover dependent. In summary, our work highlights the influence of landscape heterogeneity on the phylogenetic diversity and structure of bird communities, reinforcing the need for its incorporation into conservation-based studies.

abstract={Invasive alien species are a major driver of biodiversity loss, with their impacts potentially more intense when complexes of cryptic species are involved. In freshwaters, the anthropogenic manipulation of fish communities has resulted in altered fish communities, and in Europe has increased the complexity of Phoxinus species assemblages. Here, we investigated the Phoxinus communities of the westernmost part of the Po river basin, where adjacent freshwater ecosystems (Alpine high-altitude lakes and lowland streams) are representative of different management strategies (i.e. manipulated fish communities via stocking in Alpine lakes vs. natural populations in streams). We tested the genetic composition of the cryptic Phoxinus populations inhabiting these waters, as the species are morphologically indistinct. Sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) were obtained from 239 specimens, with the results indicating that 17 Alpine high-altitude lakes are now populated by a complex of Phoxinus species, comprising P. septimaniae (native to the Mediterranean area of France), P. csikii (native to the Central Balkans) and P. lumaireul (native to the North Adriatic Sea basins). Their introduction resulted from their use as angling live baits. Minnow populations in lowland streams were primarily comprised of native P. lumaireul, with only a single P. csikii specimen detected. While nuclear sequences of the recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1) marker were not useful for tracking the presence of alien alleles in these stream populations, the COI data emphasised the importance of using molecular tools to investigate cryptic species complexes that have been modified by anthropogenic activities. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Australia hosts approximately 10% of the world's reptile species, the largest number of any country. Despite this and evidence of widespread decline, the first comprehensive assessment of the conservation status of Australian terrestrial squamates (snakes and lizards) was undertaken only recently. Here we apply structured expert elicitation to the 60 species assessed to be in the highest IUCN threat categories to estimate their probability of extinction by 2040. We also assessed the probability of successful reintroduction for two Extinct in the Wild (EW) Christmas Island species with trial reintroductions underway. Collation and analysis of expert opinion indicated that six species are at high risk (>50%) of becoming extinct within the next 20 years, and up to 11 species could be lost within this timeframe unless management improves. The consensus among experts was that neither of the EW species were likely to persist outside of small fenced areas without a significant increase in resources for intense threat management. The 20 most imperilled species are all restricted in range, with three occurring only on islands. The others are endemic to a single state, with 55% occurring in Queensland. Invasive species (notably weeds and introduced predators) were the most prevalent threats, followed by agriculture, natural system modifications (primarily fire) and climate change. Increased resourcing and management intervention are urgently needed to avert the impending extinction of Australia's imperilled terrestrial reptiles. © 2021 Journal Compilation},

abstract={Emerging infectious diseases are major drivers of global and local amphibian biodiversity loss. Therefore, developing effective disinfection methods to manage the impact of diseases in wild and captive “ark” populations are an important goal in amphibian conservation. While chemical disinfectants have been used safely and effectively in larval and adult amphibians infected with pathogenic microbes, their applicability to amphibian egg masses has remained untested. To bridge this gap, we exposed embryos of the common toad (Bufo bufo) and agile frog (Rana dalmatina) experimentally to three widely used disinfectants: voriconazole, chloramphenicol and chlorogen-sesquihydrate. For 3 days we exposed portions of egg masses to these disinfectants at 1×, 2×, 5× and 10× the concentration recommended for the disinfection of tadpoles and adults. Subsequently, we recorded embryonic and larval survival, as well as larval body mass and the incidence of abnormalities 12 days after hatching. Application of voriconazole had species- and concentration-dependent negative impacts on survival and body mass, and caused marked malformations in the viscerocranial structure of B. bufo tadpoles. Exposure to chlorogen-sesquihydrate also resulted in significant mortality in B. bufo embryos and negatively affected body mass of R. dalmatina larvae. Chloramphenicol had little negative effects on embryos or larvae in either species. Based on these results, the application of voriconazole and chlorogen-sesquihydrate cannot be recommended for the disinfection of amphibian eggs, whereas treatment with chloramphenicol appears to be a safe method for eliminating potential pathogens from anuran egg masses and their immediate aquatic environment. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In August 24, 2017, a massive outbreak took place in the Rakhine state of Myanmar which triggered a huge refugee influx to the Teknaf Peninsula, Bangladesh. To settle the refugees, makeshift camps were built in large numbers destroying huge amount of forest areas near the existing Kutupalong and Nayapara camps. Refugees have been encroaching the nearby forest covers to collect fuelwood and other purposes. These forest destructions have put the wildlife and biodiversity of the system in a substantial pressure as well as altering the land surface temperature (LST). This paper has examined the extent of vegetation change and the changes of LST from 2017 to 2019 throughout Kutupalong and Balukhali camp and adjacent areas using Landsat 8 images. Random forest algorithm and Plank equation were applied on images to identify vegetation change and LST, respectively. The overall and kappa accuracies for the maps of 2017 are 96% and 92%, respectively, while it stands at 94% and 88% for the 2019 image. Results derived from the analysis suggest that an estimated 1876 hectares of forested lands have been decreased in the study area. LST of the study area increased spatially throughout the whole region with a maximum value of 34 °C which is significantly higher than the pre-influx period. If this trend of forest-clearing activities continues, the place will become barren land soon and the LST will also increase. All these factors will ultimately trigger the climate change impacts and biodiversity loss of the area. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Extinction events in the geological past are similar to the present-day biodiversity crisis in that they have a pronounced biogeography, producing dramatic changes in the spatial distributions of species. Reconstructing palaeobiogeographic patterns from fossils therefore allows us to examine the long-term processes governing the formation of regional biotas, and potentially helps build spatially explicit models for future biodiversity loss. However, the extent to which biogeographic patterns can be preserved in the fossil record is not well understood. Here, we perform a suite of simulations based on the present-day distribution of North American mammals, aimed at quantifying the preservation potential of beta diversity and spatial richness patterns over extinction events of varying intensities, and after applying a stepped series of taphonomic filters. We show that taphonomic biases related to body size are the biggest barrier to reconstructing biogeographic patterns over extinction events, but that these may be compensated for by both the small mammal record preserved in bird castings, as well as range expansion in surviving species. Overall, our results suggest that the preservation potential of biogeographic patterns is surprisingly high, and thus that the fossil record represents an invaluable dataset recording the changing spatial distribution of biota over key intervals in Earth History. © 2021 The Authors.},

abstract={Wildlife disease is a major cause of global biodiversity loss. Amongst the most devastating is the disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). This disease has contributed to declines and extinctions in hundreds of amphibian species, but not all species are affected equally. Some amphibian hosts are capable of carrying high levels of Bd infection without population declines, acting as reservoir species for the pathogen and driving population declines in sympatric species. In Australia, several species have been proposed as reservoir species; however, our understanding of Bd is derived from studies that are highly geographically and taxonomically biased, and our ability to extrapolate from these systems is unknown. We examined the prevalence and intensity of Bd infection in 3 frog species in a previously unstudied host-pathogen system in temperate eastern Australia: the Blue Mountains tree frog Litoria citropa, a poorly-known species predicted to be susceptible to Bd infection; and the common eastern froglet Crinia signifera and the stony creek frog L. lesueuri, which have both been identified as reservoir species in other regions. We found that L. citropa and L. lesueuri were infected with Bd at a high prevalence and often high intensity, while the reverse was true for C. signifera. All species were detected at moderate abundance and there was no evidence of morbidity and mortality. Our findings do not support C. signifera and L. lesueuri being reservoir species in this system, highlighting the importance of region-specific studies to inform conservation management.},

abstract={Anthropogenic landscape disturbances are known to alter, destroy, and fragment habitat, which typically leads to biodiversity loss. The effects of landscape disturbance generally vary among species and depend on the nature of the disturbances, which may interact and result in synergistic effects. Western Canada's oil sands region experiences disturbances from forestry and energy sector activities as well as municipal and transportation infrastructure. The effects of those disturbances on single species have been studied and have been implicated in declines of the boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Yet, the specific responses of the mammal community, and of functional groups such as prey and predators, to those interacting disturbances are still poorly known. We investigated the responses of black bear, grey wolf, coyote, fisher, lynx, red fox, American red squirrel, white-tailed deer, moose, caribou, and snowshoe hare to both natural habitat and disturbance associated with anthropogenic features within Alberta's northeast boreal forest. We used a novel community-level modelling framework on three years of camera-trap data collected in an oil sands landscape. This framework allowed us to identify the natural and anthropogenic features which explained the most variation in occurrence frequency among functional groups, as well as compare responses to linear and non-linear anthropogenic disturbance. Occurrence frequency by predators was better explained by anthropogenic features than by natural habitat. Both linear and non-linear anthropogenic features helped explain occurrence frequency by prey and predators, although the effects differed in magnitude and spatial scale. To better conserve boreal biodiversity, management actions should extend beyond a focus on caribou and wolves and aim to restore habitat across a diversity of anthropogenic disturbances and monitor the dynamics of the entire mammal community. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Chenhu wetland is a typical freshwater lake-type wetland in the Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain, and has severely degraded since 1960s. In this study, aerial photographs or remote sensing images captured at eight different stages (i.e. 1964, 1975, 1987, 1997, 1998, 2007, 2016 and 2018) were analyzed to reveal the degradation processes and mechanisms of the Chenhu wetland in Wuhan over the past 50 years by the aid of remote sensing, dynamic degree models and transition matrix models.Our investigation reveals that the Chenhu wetland was gradually altered to fish ponds or agricultural lands from north to south, shrunk up to 77% in total between 1964 and 2018. Degradation of the Chenhu wetland by human impacts during this period can be divided into three stages: (i) between 1964 and 1975, degradation was dominated by filling of lakes into agricultural lands, with the rate of agricultural lands expansion exceeding 141%; (ii) between 1975 and 1994, artificial lake reconstruction projects has altered large areas of lakes into marshes; (iii) between 1997 and 2018, new marshes altered from lakes were further cultivated into agricultural lands or reserved as fish ponds. In general, population expansion and changes in land use policies have caused the degradation of ecosystem services, including impaired capacity in flood regulation and storage, natural self-purification and biodiversity losses. The degradation modes uncovered for the Chenhu wetland can also shed light on similar investigations on the degradation of other lake-type wetlands in Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain and even the whole China. © 2021, Editorial Department of Earth Science.

abstract={Impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem dynamics and functioning have aroused considerable attention and controversies. Loss of plant species is common in natural assembled community, whereas the response of ecosystem process remains unclearly. The continuous overgrazing of livestock has resulted significant plant species loss, like palatable grass and sedge species in alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. In this study, we conducted a plant removal experiment to simulate the species loss along retrogressive succession gradient of alpine meadow resulting from long term overgrazing. A typical alpine meadow located on the eastern edge of the plateau was selected as the object to conduct the removal manipulation. The study site was fenced in April 2014 after the long term moderate winter grazing of yaks to exclude grazing of herbivores. Six removal treatments including: remove no plant species, remove Crass, remove Crass and Sedge, remove all species, randomly remove 25% of community aboveground biomass, and randomly remove 50% of community aboveground biomass. In middle July 2014 and 2015, we removed aboveground part of specific plant species individuals in 1 m X 1 m plots. In late July 2016, the community coverage, height, species composition, diversity indices and biomass were investigated based on 0.5 m×0.5 m quadrats to detect response of alpine meadow to the removal experiment. The results showed that (1) removal of plant functional group (PFG) decreased the weighted-average height of community, but had no significant effect on the cumulative coverage of community. (2) Removal manipulation significantly influenced the summed dominance ratio (SDR) of Crass and Forb group, while no significant for Sedge group. (3) Removal of PFC increased the species evenness, and significantly influenced PFC diversity and dominance, whereas showed no significant effects for other diversity indices. (4) Removal of PFC reduced the litter biomass and Crass biomass. Only the removal of all plant reduced the community aboveground biomass. (5) In addition, further analysis showed that the community aboveground biomass was mainly depending on the Crass group, and decreased significantly with the increase of species evenness. And significantly competitive relationships were found among Crass, Sedge and Forb groups. The results showed that Crass species in the alpine meadow community have the greatest competitive advantage, the loss of plant species could change the community properties by means of influencing the inter-specific competitive relationships and significant plant biomass loss. The successive long-term monitoring on the response of community functioning to plant species loss should be strengthened. © 2021 Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={With increasing biodiversity loss occurring worldwide, there is a need to understand how these losses will affect ecosystem structure and function. Biodiversity loss leads to changes in species interactions and alters the trophic complexity of food webs. These alterations to trophic complexity can be described by changes to the diversity of food resources and the diversity of trophic levels. To understand how biodiversity affects trophic complexity of food webs, we used 10 islands across the Aleutian Archipelago to compare the alternate state communities found in kelp forest ecosystems (kelp forest and urchin barren communities) and then compared these to natural reference communities without local benthic production (their associated offshore communities). We constructed food webs for each community across the Aleutian Archipelago using primary producer and consumer carbon (δ13C, a proxy for food sources to a consumer) and nitrogen (δ15N, a proxy for consumer trophic level) stable isotope values. Our findings suggest that biodiversity loss (i.e., phase change from kelp forest to urchin barren) leads to reductions in trophic complexity, which was similar to naturally occurring communities with low local resource biodiversity. This was expressed by lower consumer isotopic dietary niche areas, especially omnivores and herbivores, and lower omnivore and carnivore trophic levels within the urchin barren communities. We clarify how biodiversity promotes food resources and increases trophic levels and complexity through critical trophic conduits. © 2021 The Authors.},

Here we integrate genomics and environmental modelling to assess climate change responses in an ecologically and economically important Arctic species. Environmentally associated genomic diversity and machine learning are used to identify highly vulnerable populations of anadromous (migratory) Arctic charr, and we reconstruct estimates of effective population size spanning the twentieth century to identify past climate-associated declines. We uncover past region-wide declines in effective population size that correspond to decreases in temperature and community biomass in the Northwest Atlantic. We find vulnerable populations near the southern range limit, indicating northward shifts and a possible loss of commercially important life-history variation in response to climate change. The genomic approach used here to investigate climate change response identifies past and future declines that impact species persistence, ecosystem stability and food security in the Arctic. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={The peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) has been affected by persecution, pollution, trade, and habitat degradation, but it is considered a flagship conservation success story because of successful reintroductions and population recoveries across broad ranges. However, in the UK there were never formal reintroduction programmes for peregrine falcons, and it appears that UK populations—and specifically the Sussex peregrines of the English south coast—recently recovered from a population crash unassisted. To study this, we obtained samples from contemporary populations in southern England, Ireland, continental Europe, domestic-bred peregrine falcons, and from England pre-population crash. Using microsatellite and mtDNA control region data, the genetic diversity and structure, signatures of genetic bottlenecks, and potential origin of the Sussex peregrines was investigated. We found low levels of genetic diversity across all peregrine falcon groups, low but significant genetic differentiation, and a few private alleles, indicating some level of genetic structure among European peregrines. Although we could not pinpoint the origin of the Sussex peregrines, the data suggests that it is not likely to have originated from escaped domestic birds or from adjacent European populations. The results obtained here parallel other studies on peregrines elsewhere showing low genetic diversity but genetic structure. We conclude that not enough time elapsed for genetic erosion to occur due to the population bottleneck, and that at least for the Sussex peregrines there is no need for genetic conservation by wild-take and subsequent captive breeding programmes as long as current protection measures remain in place. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The global decline of brown algal forests along rocky coasts is causing an exceptional biodiversity loss. Regardless of conservation efforts, different techniques have been developed for large-scale restoration strategies in the Mediterranean Sea. In this study we tested ex situ pilot restoration of Gongolaria barbata (=Treptacantha barbata) for the first time in Slovenian coastal waters. Healthy apical fronds of the species were collected and the development of recruits on clay tiles was followed under laboratory conditions for 20 days. Despite the experimental difficulties experienced, especially due to the lack of antibiotics to prevent the growth of the biofilm, G. barbata recruits were outplanted in the sea on two concrete plates with 48 tiles each, protected by purpose-built cages to avoid grazing by herbivorous fish. The high survival rate of juveniles after four months in the field (89% of the tiles on the plate that was constantly protected) suggests that outplanting G. barbata is an operable approach for restoration efforts in the northern Adriatic Sea. Our first experiment in Slovenian coastal waters provides new information for the optimization of the best practices during the laboratory cultivation and addresses the early steps of restoration and introduction of young thalli in the natural environment. © 2021 by the authors.},

abstract={The diversity and abundance of native invertebrates is declining globally, which could have significant consequences for ecosystem functioning. Declines are likely to be at least as severe as those observed for vertebrates, although often are difficult to quantify due to a lack of historic baseline data and limited monitoring effort. The Lepidoptera are well studied in Australia compared with other invertebrates, so we know that some species are imperilled or declining. Despite this, few butterfly taxa are explicitly listed for protection by legislation. Here we aim to identify the butterfly taxa that would most benefit from listing by determining the Australian butterflies at most immediate risk of extinction. We also identify the research and management actions needed to retain them. For 26 taxa identified by experts and various conservation schedules, we used structured expert elicitation to estimate the probability of extinction within 20 years (i.e. by 2040) and to identify key threatening processes, priority research and management needs. Collation and analysis of expert opinion indicated that one taxon, the laced fritillary (Argynnis hyperbius inconstans), is particularly imperilled, and that four taxa (Jalmenus eubulus, Jalmenus aridus, Hypochrysops piceatus and Oreisplanus munionga larana) have a moderate–high (>30%) risk of extinction by 2040. Mapped distributions of the 26 butterflies revealed that most are endemic to a single state or territory, and that many occupy narrow ranges. Inappropriate fire regimes, habitat loss and fragmentation (through agricultural practices), invasive species (mostly through habitat degradation caused by weeds and rabbits) and climate change were the most prevalent threats affecting the taxa considered. Increased resourcing and management intervention will be required to prevent these extinctions. We provide specific recommendations for averting such losses. © 2021 Australian Entomological Society},

abstract={The rapid extinction of species over the past few decades has created a biodiversity crisis. Factors contributing to recent extirpations are linked to increased human population growth, habitat loss and fragmentation, and over-exploitation of wildlife. Only decisive, effective action to combat biodiversity loss can reverse these trends. The use of indicator species as surrogates for biodiversity provides a way to identify areas with high biodiversity so that conservation efforts can be accelerated and supported in those areas. Predators are considered important indicators of healthy, biodiverse ecosystems due to their high trophic level and their direct and indirect interaction with other species. Using camera trap data from 221 cameras set across five vegetation types and five land use zones in South Africa, we evaluated carnivores as potential surrogates for biodiversity. We used the leopard (Panthera pardus), and three meso-predators: caracal (Caracal caracal), honey badger (Mellivora capensis), and black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas), as candidate indicator species. We used mammals captured at the camera traps as a measure of biodiversity referred to as mammalian species richness. The mammalian species richness was highest in the Orange River Nama Karoo vegetation type and in privately owned game reserves. We found that predator sightings were associated with significantly higher mammalian species richness which increased with increasing number of predator species. These findings suggest that the surrogate species concept can be applied to leopard and meso-predators. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={The ongoing environmental crisis poses an urgent need to forecast the who, where and when of future species extinctions, as such information is crucial for targeting conservation efforts. Commonly, such forecasts are made based on conservation status assessments produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, when researchers apply these IUCN conservation status data for predicting future extinctions, important information is often omitted, which can impact the accuracy of these predictions. Here we present a new approach and a software for simulating future extinctions based on IUCN conservation status information, which incorporates generation length information of individual species when modeling extinction risks. Additionally, we explicitly model future changes in conservation status for each species, based on status transition rates that we estimate from the IUCN assessment history of the last decades. Finally, we apply a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate extinction rates for each species, based on the simulated future extinctions. These estimates inherently incorporate the chances of conservation status changes and the generation length for each given species and are specific to the simulated time frame. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by estimating future extinction rates for all bird species. Our average extinction rate estimate for the next 100 yr across all birds is 6.98 × 10−4 extinctions per species-year, and we predict an expected biodiversity loss of between 669 and 738 bird species within that time frame. Further, the rate estimates between species sharing the same IUCN status show larger variation than the rates estimated with alternative approaches, which reflects expected differences in extinction risk among taxa of the same conservation status. Our method demonstrates the utility of applying species-specific information to the estimation of extinction rates, rather than assuming equal extinction risks for species assigned to the same conservation status. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Aim: Understanding temporal changes in aquatic communities is essential to address the freshwater biodiversity crisis. In particular, it is important to understand the patterns and drivers of spatial variation in local community dynamics, generalizing temporal trends from discrete locations to entire landscapes that are the main focus of management. Here, we present a framework for producing spatially continuous views of community dynamics, focusing on stream fish affected by hydropower development. Location: River Sabor, NE Portugal. Methods: We sampled stream fish at thirty sites between 2012 and 2019. Community trajectory analysis was used to quantify the directionality and velocity of community change, and the geometric resemblance of community trajectories between sites. Geostatistical models for stream networks were used to relate metrics describing community dynamics to environmental variables, while controlling for Euclidean and hydrologic spatial dependencies, and to map spatial variation in community dynamics across the watershed. Results: Trajectories in multivariate space underlined strong temporal dynamics, with local communities deviating and returning to previous states, but without evidence for directional changes. Accordingly, directionality values were low and not consistently affected by environmental variables. The velocity of community change varied markedly across the watershed and it was strongly affected by stream order and elevation, with faster changes observed in lowland streams draining into hydroelectric reservoirs and with a high proportion of exotic species. Pairwise distances between community trajectories were strongly related to hydrologic and environmental distances between sites. Main conclusions: Local stream fish communities were in a loose equilibrium across the watershed, but they fluctuated at a faster rate closer to a hydroelectric reservoir. Integrating community trajectory analysis and geostatistical modelling provides a relatively simple framework to understand how, where and why temporal community dynamics vary across dendritic stream networks and to visualize spatial patterns of community change over time in relation to anthropogenic impacts. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={This paper presents the zooarchaeological research carried out on Ctenomys (Rodentia: Ctenomyidae) bone remains recovered at Quebrada del Real 1 (ca. 7400–360 years BP), an archaeological site located in the Sierras of Córdoba upper mountain grassland range of Argentina. Here, we focus on the importance of Ctenomys implications to wild-life management and conservation biology rather than its classical archaeological view as a subsistence resource. The primary aim was to provide critical information about the recent past biogeography of Ctenomys that may not be evident from modern fauna surveys. From the description of a highly specialised fossorial rodent extinct at the end of the Holocene, the study points out the extreme fragility of the Sierras of Córdoba high mountain environments under climate change and anthropogenic threat, drawing on data that are relevant to those who make decisions and write guidelines for wild-life management. The analysis of the Ctenomys assemblage from Quebrada del Real 1 revealed information related to the management, conservation and restoration of the mountain top environments that cannot be ignored by conservation biologists and wild-life managers, moreover when the causes that lead to the extinction of C. viarapaensis are the same ones affecting to modern plant and animal communities. The zooarchaeological record reflects past conditions to assess preindustrial ecological states of the upper mountain grassland range that otherwise would have never been known as a baseline for environmental management. Thus, applied zooarchaeology to conservation biology requires further exploration at Sierras of Córdoba in order to produce accurate knowledge about the high-altitude ecosystems function, fragility and biodiversity loss, which is necessary to understand the present and improve the future of three million people who depend on the ecological services from these environments. © 2020 Ecological Society of Australia},

abstract={The paper investigates the relative influence of landscape characteristics, production intensity and the EU's Common agricultural policy interventions on the diversity of farmland birds. For this purpose, data from the Farmland Bird Monitoring Scheme in Slovenia and high spatial resolution data from the national agricultural databases in the period 2008–2019 were analysed with the Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). The diversity of farmland birds was found to be highest in open, diversely cropped and extensively to moderately intensively managed landscapes in Natura 2000 sites where farm holdings were allocated a low average amount of both direct payments and payments for agri-environmental measures (AEM) and organic farming (OF). Furthermore, the highest diversity of the subgroup of grassland specialists was associated with very open and extensively managed grassland landscapes with low stocking density (<0.7 LU/ha). By contrast, the diversity of habitat generalists was highest in heterogeneous landscapes with a high diversity of land-use types, measured at the broader spatial scale. Areas with a higher allocation of direct payments and payments for AEM and OF were associated with lower farmland bird diversity, whereas high diversity was found in Natura 2000 sites and in some areas with natural constraints (LFA). Agri-environmental measures and the “Greening” measures had a negligible relative influence on bird diversity, possibly due to ineffective implementation and low uptake by beneficiaries. The intensification of production, particularly in the beef and dairy sectors, which has been supported by the Common agricultural policy direct payments, and forest succession in marginal areas were identified as the potential key drivers of the recent farmland biodiversity loss in Slovenia. The future CAP income support schemes should be redesigned to ensure at least neutral if not positive overall effects on farmland biodiversity by gradual phasing-out of references to (historic) production levels, increased conditionality and more effective voluntary agri-environmental measures. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Understanding the processes shaping the composition of assemblages in response to disturbance events is crucial for preventing ongoing biodiversity loss in forest ecosystems. However, studies of forest biodiversity responses to disturbance typically analyze immediate or short-term impacts only, while studies relating long-term disturbance history to biodiversity assemblage dynamics are rare. To address this important knowledge gap, we used a dendroecological approach to link natural disturbance history of 250 years (1750–2000) to structural habitat elements and, in turn, to breeding bird assemblages. We used data collected in 2017 and 2018 from 58 permanent study plots within 10 primary spruce forest stands distributed across the Western Carpathian Mountains of Europe. This dataset contained breeding bird counts and environmental variables describing forest density, tree diameter distribution, tree height, tree microhabitats, deadwood quantity and quality, and regeneration. Bird assemblages were significantly influenced by forest structure which was in turn shaped by disturbance dynamics (disturbance frequency, time since the last disturbance and its severity). Early successional species associated with more open habitats were positively influenced by disturbance-related structure (i.e. deadwood-related variables, canopy cover), while some species responded negatively. At the same time, overall abundance, species richness and Shannon diversity of the bird assemblage remained unchanged under variable disturbance histories. Our results support a view of primary spruce forests as a highly dynamic ecosystem, harbouring populations of bird species at all stages of succession despite significant structural changes and shifting patch mosaics over time due to natural disturbances. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Many long-term wildlife population monitoring programmes rely on citizen scientists for data collection. This can offer several benefits over traditional monitoring practices as it is a cost-effective, large-scale approach capable of providing long time series data and raising public environmental awareness. Whilst there is a debate about the quality of citizen science data, a standardised sampling design can allow citizen science data to be of a similar quality to those collected by professionals. However, many programmes use subjective, opportunistic selection of monitoring sites and this introduces several types of bias, which are not well understood. Using bat roost counts as a case study, we took a ‘virtual ecologist’ approach to simulate the effect of opportunistic site selection and uneven observer retention on our ability to accurately detect abundance trends. We simulated populations with different levels of temporal variability and site fidelity. Our simulations reveal that opportunistic site selection and low observer retention can result in biased trends and that these biases are magnified when monitored populations exhibit high levels of inter-annual variation and low site fidelity. These results show that the synergistic effects of observer behaviour, site selection, and population dynamics lead to biased abundance trends in monitoring programmes. This study highlights the value of engaging and retaining citizen science observers, a standardised sampling design, and the collection of metadata. We conclude that monitoring programmes need to be aware of their focal species' temporal variability and site fidelity to adequately assess the potential bias caused by opportunistic site selection and low observer retention. Synthesis and applications. Accurate data on population changes are key for conservation success. Therefore, it is important that citizen science monitoring programmes assess and potentially quantify the biases present in their data. We demonstrate the applicability of an established simulation framework to assess the effect of biases on our ability to correctly detect abundance trends. Our findings highlight that monitoring programmes need to be aware of their study species’ temporal variability and site fidelity to assess and account for the effects of biased site selection and observer retention. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Extinctions of undiscovered species (undetected extinctions) constitute a portion of biodiversity loss that is often ignored. We compared the performance of 2 models of undetected extinctions – Tedesco and SEUX – when estimating undetected extinctions with both simulated and real-world data. We generated simulated data by considering a birth-death process in which less abundant species were more likely to go extinct. When detection rates were higher for common species, the 2 models underestimated the true number of undetected extinctions by up to 88.7%, and when detection rates were independent of abundance, the 2 models performed better; the SEUX model had an average bias of +3.1% and the Tedesco model had an average bias of −62.3%. We applied the models to 8 real-world data sets (e.g., Australian amphibians, Australian birds, North American bivalves) and found that true extinctions may be from 15% to 180% higher than observed values. For 6 of the 8 data sets, the SEUX model yielded absolute estimates that were 5.7–66.8% lower than those of the Tedesco model. We mainly attributed this difference to the SEUX model's assumption that there are no undetected extant species currently. We assessed the accuracy of the models’ estimates with a logistic regression to test whether detection and extinction rates were uncorrelated across species. Rates were correlated for 3 of the 8 data sets; species discovered later had a higher probability of being extinct, suggesting that extinction numbers could be even higher for these groups. Despite caveats associated with the models, the evidence from both show biodiversity loss in these groups may be more severe than what has been documented. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology},

abstract={Illegal transfer of wildlife has 2 main purposes: trade and scientific research. Trade is the most common, whereas scientific research is much less common and unprofitable, yet still important. Biopiracy in science is often neglected despite that many researchers encounter it during their careers. The use of illegally acquired specimens is detected in different research fields, from scientists bioprospecting for new pharmacological substances, to taxonomists working on natural history collections, to researchers working in zoos, aquariums, and botanical gardens. The practice can be due to a lack of knowledge about the permit requirements in different countries or, probably most often, to the generally high level of bureaucracy associated with rule compliance. Significant regulatory filters to avoid biopiracy can be provided by different stakeholders. Natural history collection hosts should adopt strict codes of conduct; editors of scientific publications should require authors to declare that all studied specimens were acquired legally and to cite museum catalog numbers as guarantee of best practices. Scientific societies should actively encourage publication in peer-reviewed journals of work in which specimens collected from the wild were used. The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature could require newly designated types based on recently collected specimens to be accompanied by statements of deposition in recognized scientific or educational institutions. We also propose the creation of an online platform that gathers information about environmental regulations and permits required for scientific activities in different countries and respective responsible governmental agencies and the simplification of the bureaucracy related to regulating scientific activities. This would make regulations more agile and easier to comply with. The global biodiversity crisis means data need to be collected ever faster, but biopiracy is not the answer and undermines the credibility of science and researchers. It is critical to find a modus vivendi that promotes compliance with regulations and scientific progress. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Efforts to tackle the current biodiversity crisis need to be as efficient and effective as possible given chronic underfunding. To inform decision-makers of the most effective conservation actions, it is important to identify biases and gaps in the conservation literature to prioritize future evidence generation. We used the Conservation Evidence database to assess the state of the global literature that tests conservation actions for amphibians and birds. For the studies in the database, we investigated their spatial and taxonomic extent and distribution across biomes, effectiveness metrics, and study designs. Studies were heavily concentrated in Western Europe and North America for birds and particularly for amphibians, and temperate forest and grassland biomes were highly represented relative to their percentage of land coverage. Studies that used the most reliable study designs—before-after control-impact and randomized controlled trials—were the most geographically restricted and scarce in the evidence base. There were negative spatial relationships between the numbers of studies and the numbers of threatened and data-deficient species worldwide. Taxonomic biases and gaps were apparent for amphibians and birds—some entire orders were absent from the evidence base—whereas others were poorly represented relative to the proportion of threatened species they contained. Metrics used to evaluate effectiveness of conservation actions were often inconsistent between studies, potentially making them less directly comparable and evidence synthesis more difficult. Testing conservation actions on threatened species outside Western Europe, North America, and Australasia should be prioritized. Standardizing metrics and improving the rigor of study designs used to test conservation actions would also improve the quality of the evidence base for synthesis and decision-making. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Urbanization is one of the most important causes of ecological changes and biodiversity loss worldwide, and forests in Latin America provide valuable scenarios to understand the ecological effects of this human-driven phenomenon due to its high urbanization rate. Our aim was to investigate how urbanization shapes species richness (SR) and composition of anuran communities in NW Argentina, and to determine which suite of life history traits are related to anuran tolerance to urban development. We classified anuran species in Functional Groups (FG) based on a series of ecological traits and recognized them as urban-tolerant or urban-avoiders. We constructed an urbanization composite index (UI) through an exploratory factor analysis based on measures of artificial light intensity, noise pollution, land use types, and mean values of LTS, NDMI, and NDVI. We tested the response of SR, FG and species occurrence to UI with Generalized Linear Models and a variation partitioning analysis. Our results showed the negative influence of urbanization on anuran diversity and suggested that the loss of anuran species is not random, pointing to the presence of environmental filters. Only terrestrial frogs that build aquatic foam nests were not affected by an increase in urbanization, so they may be considered as urban--tolerant. Further, our results highlighted the important role of dispersal capacity in structuring the urban anuran assemblages. As ecologists working in urban habitats, we emphasize the need of a more comprehensive and generalized understanding of ecological and life history traits associated with urban tolerant anurans. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Habitat loss and fragmentation are key drivers of biodiversity loss. However, they are usually confounded, making it difficult to separate fragmentation effects from those of habitat loss. In addition, it has been shown that often fragmentation negatively affects biodiversity only below a certain threshold of habitat amount. We investigated the separate and interactive effects of habitat amount and fragmentation on habitat selection of the woodlark at 10 spatial scales. In southern Switzerland this passerine mainly breeds in ground-vegetated vineyards, which therefore represent the focal habitat type in this study. Additionally, we investigated land cover, topographic and climatic variables at the same 10 scales to obtain a holistic picture of species-habitat associations. Habitat selection was analyzed at two hierarchical levels: home range selection within the study area and habitat use within home ranges. Home range selection was strongly driven by an interactive effect of habitat amount and fragmentation: woodlarks avoided fragmented areas if habitat amount was below 20% but exhibited a preference for fragmented areas if habitat amount exceeded this threshold. Both habitat amount and fragmentation most strongly affected habitat use at the 100 m scale. We did not find such interactive effects for habitat use within home ranges. At this level, habitat amount at a 50 m scale influenced woodlark presence positively with no significant effects of fragmentation. Furthermore, woodlarks preferred evenly sloped landscape mosaics interspersed with steppes and groves. Two main insights emerge from our study. First, these results highlight the necessity of studying scale explicit and interactive effects of habitat amount and fragmentation when addressing ecological questions, such as habitat selection in birds. Second, we provide management recommendations for farmers: more vineyards should be vegetated and arranged as disjunct patches where their surface covers more than 20% of the landscape but be aggregated where vegetated area is lower. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London},

abstract={The loss of biodiversity in the ecosystems has created the general conditions that have favored and, in fact, made possible, the insurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic. A lot of factors have contributed to it: deforestation, changes in forest habitats, poorly regulated agricultural surfaces, mismanaged urban growth. They have altered the composition of wildlife communities, greatly increased the contacts of humans with wildlife, and altered niches that harbor pathogens, increasing their chances to come in contact with humans. Among the wildlife, bats have adapted easily to anthropized environments such as houses, barns, cultivated fields, orchards, where they found the suitable ecosystem to prosper. Bats are major hosts for αCoV and βCoV: evolution has shaped their peculiar physiology and their immune system in a way that makes them resistant to viral pathogens that would instead successfully attack other species, including humans. In time, the coronaviruses that bats host as reservoirs have undergone recombination and other modifications that have increased their ability for inter-species transmission: one modification of particular importance has been the development of the ability to use ACE2 as a receptor in host cells. This particular development in CoVs has been responsible for the serious outbreaks in the last two decades, and for the present COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Land-use change is a root cause of the extinction crisis, but links between habitat change and biodiversity loss are not fully understood. While there is evidence that habitat loss is an important extinction driver, the relevance of habitat fragmentation remains debated. Moreover, while time delays of biodiversity responses to habitat transformation are well-documented, time-delayed effects have been ignored in the habitat loss versus fragmentation debate. Here, using a hierarchical Bayesian multi-species occupancy framework, we systematically tested for time-delayed responses of bird and mammal communities to habitat loss and to habitat fragmentation. We focused on the Argentine Chaco, where deforestation has been widespread recently. We used an extensive field dataset on birds and mammals, along with a time series of annual woodland maps from 1985 to 2016 covering recent and historical habitat transformations. Contemporary habitat amount explained bird and mammal occupancy better than past habitat amount. However, occupancy was affected more by the past rather than recent fragmentation, indicating a time-delayed response to fragmentation. Considering past landscape patterns is therefore crucial for understanding current biodiversity patterns. Not accounting for land-use history ignores the possibility of extinction debt and can thus obscure impacts of fragmentation, potentially explaining contrasting findings of habitat loss versus fragmentation studies. © 2021 The Author(s).},

abstract={Anthropogenic habitat modification is a major driver of global biodiversity loss. In North America, one of the primary sources of habitat modification over the last 2 decades has been exploration for and production of oil and natural gas (hydrocarbon development), which has led to demographic and behavioral impacts to numerous wildlife species. Developing effective measures to mitigate these impacts has become a critical task for wildlife managers and conservation practitioners. However, this task has been hindered by the difficulties involved in identifying and isolating factors driving population responses. Current research on responses of wildlife to development predominantly quantifies behavior, but it is not always clear how these responses scale to demography and population dynamics. Concomitant assessments of behavior and population-level processes are needed to gain the mechanistic understanding required to develop effective mitigation approaches. We simultaneously assessed the demographic and behavioral responses of a mule deer population to natural gas development on winter range in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, USA, from 2008 to 2015. Notably, this was the period when development declined from high levels of active drilling to only production phase activity (i.e., no drilling). We focused our data collection on 2 contiguous mule deer winter range study areas that experienced starkly different levels of hydrocarbon development within the Piceance Basin. We assessed mule deer behavioral responses to a range of development features with varying levels of associated human activity by examining habitat selection patterns of nearly 400 individual adult female mule deer. Concurrently, we assessed the demographic and physiological effects of natural gas development by comparing annual adult female and overwinter fawn (6-month-old animals) survival, December fawn mass, adult female late and early winter body fat, age, pregnancy rates, fetal counts, and lactation rates in December between the 2 study areas. Strong differences in habitat selection between the 2 study areas were apparent. Deer in the less-developed study area avoided development during the day and night, and selected habitat presumed to be used for foraging. Deer in the heavily developed study area selected habitat presumed to be used for thermal and security cover to a greater degree. Deer faced with higher densities of development avoided areas with more well pads during the day and responded neutrally or selected for these areas at night. Deer in both study areas showed a strong reduction in use of areas around well pads that were being drilled, which is the phase of energy development associated with the greatest amount of human presence, vehicle traffic, noise, and artificial light. Despite divergent habitat selection patterns, we found no effects of development on individual condition or reproduction and found no differences in any of the physiological or vital rate parameters measured at the population level. However, deer density and annual increases in density were higher in the low-development area. Thus, the recorded behavioral alterations did not appear to be associated with demographic or physiological costs measured at the individual level, possibly because populations are below winter range carrying capacity. Differences in population density between the 2 areas may be a result of a population decline prior to our study (when development was initiated) or area-specific differences in habitat quality, juvenile dispersal, or neonatal or juvenile survival; however, we lack the required data to contrast evidence for these mechanisms. Given our results, it appears that deer can adjust to relatively high densities of well pads in the production phase (the period with markedly lower human activity on the landscape), provided there is sufficient vegetative and topographic cover afforded to them and populations are below carrying capacity. The strong reaction to wells in the drilling phase of development suggests mitigation efforts should focus on this activity and stage of development. Many of the wells in this area were directionally drilled from multiple-well pads, leading to a reduced footprint of disturbance, but were still related to strong behavioral responses. Our results also indicate the likely value of mitigation efforts focusing on reducing human activity (i.e., vehicle traffic, light, and noise). In combination, these findings indicate that attention should be paid to the spatial configuration of the final development footprint to ensure adequate cover. In our study system, minimizing the road network through landscape-level development planning would be valuable (i.e., exploring a maximum road density criteria). Lastly, our study highlights the importance of concomitant assessments of behavior and demography to provide a comprehensive understanding of how wildlife respond to habitat modification. © 2021 The Wildlife Society. © 2021 The Wildlife Society},

abstract={Biodiversity loss is a consequence of socio-ecological processes. Observations on anthropogenic actions toward ecosystems coupled to observations on ecosystem metrics are needed to help understand these processes so that ecosystem management policies can be derived and implemented to curb such destruction. Such data needs to be maintained in searchable data portals. To this end, this article delivers a first-of-its-kind relational database of observations on coupled anthropogenic and ecosystem actions. This Ecosystem Management Actions Taxonomy (EMAT) database is founded on a taxonomy designed to support models of political-ecological processes. Structured query language scripts for building and querying these databases are described. The use of episodes in the construction of political-ecological theory is also introduced. These are frequently occurring sequences of political-ecological actions. Those episodes that test positive for causality can aid in improving a political-ecological theory by driving modifications to an attendant computational model so that it generates them. Two relational databases of political-ecological actions are described that are built from online news articles and published data on species abundance. The first concerns the management of the East African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) population, and the second is focused on the management of rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum) in South Africa. The cheetah database is used to study the political drivers of cheetah habitat loss, and the rhino database is used study the political drivers of rhino poaching. An EMAT database is a fundamental breakthrough because is provides a language for conservation science to identify the objects and phenomena that it is about. Therefore, maintaining political-ecological data in EMAT databases will advance conservation science and consequently, improve management policies that are based on that science.

abstract={Introduction. The highlands of the Ukrainian Carpathians belong to the territories with the highest concentration of rare species and coenotic diversity in Ukraine. Due to highland ecosystem transformation, a large number of populations and communities of rare species are under the threat of degradation and elimination. Climate change. At present, effective growth and development of plants begins 2-3 weeks earlier compared to the 1980-90s. Sharp seasonal distribution of precipitation causes negative changes in the highland water-body hydrology regime affecting freshwater populations of plankton crustaceans and amphibians. Demutative successions. During the first 10-20 years of the succession its influence on the structure and vitality of the majority of rare species populations is mostly positive, but 30-40 year-long demutations usually cause negative dynamics. Overgrowing results in the simplification of spatial structure and fragmentation, as well as decreasing of population density, disappearing of rare species from the community structure. Active protection measures should be locally implemented in protected territories: Traditional type of grazing, mowing, and shrub or tree cutting in the cases of protection of extremely rare phytocoenoses and populations. Anthropogenic impact. Intensive recreation pressure causes digressive changes in numerous communities, which are located along the popular tourist paths to the glacial lakes, mountain summits etc. Unfortunately, the systematic violation of the protection regime in the highland zone of the Ukrainian Carpathians is obvious nowadays. Gathering medicinal and ornamental species poses a serious threat. Uncontrolled increase in the number of recreants in the highland areas for the last 5 years has destroyed its aquatic ecosystems more than in the previous 30-40 years. Usage of vehicles for recreation purposes (4×4, quads and motorcycles) refers to significant destructive factors for highland ecosystems. Protection measures. Population conservation and revival of communities is usually possible under the condition of moderate and short-term anthropogenic pressure. The visiting regime of the most popular highland sites must be put under control immediately, while mass ascensions must be completely forbidden. © 2021 V. Kyyak, T. Mykitchak O. Reshetylo.},

abstract={The Philippines is a biodiversity hotspot. It is a recognized source, destination, and transit point for the global wildlife trade, which drives biodiversity loss. There is an abundance of data from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) on the Philippines, but this data has not been assessed for historical trends. Confiscation data reflecting the illegal trade is scarcer, coming from recent (2008 onward) records of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources – Biodiversity Management Bureau (DENR-BMB) and the Palawan Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD). CITES data from 1975 to 2018 include over 16 million units of animals or animal parts from 20,728 trade records. Birds are the most traded taxon at 43.92% of all trade records, and the USA has been the largest importer of wildlife from the Philippines. DENR-BMB and PCSD records show that birds and reptiles each account for 36.46% of confiscated species. Reptiles, particularly sea turtles, are the most frequently traded in the illegal markets. Many species of animals that appear in all three databases are endemic to the Philippines but not afforded enough protection by CITES or national laws and documents such as the Philippine Red List. Temporal trends in both legal and illegal wildlife trade should strongly influence conservation strategies and policies aimed at controlling the trade of wildlife from the Philippines, including reassessment of the conservation status and possible inclusion in CITES Appendices of problematic endemic species. © 2021, Philippine-American Academy of Science and Engineering.

abstract={Although biodiversity conservation and restoration can significantly contribute to environmental health in urban areas, rapid urbanization undermines biodiversity in various ways. We hypothesize that one challenge that will arise after the COVID-19 pandemic is the accelerated expansion of urban areas through two distinct mechanisms: more informal settlements due to increased poverty and increased urban sprawl due to increased suburban development. In response to this challenge, we call for a global agenda to put the concept of wildlife-supportive green space design into action. We suggest 12 major issues for future research and practice that should be scrutinized in the post-COVID-19 era. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Arable vegetation of calcareous soils, the plant community alliance known as Caucalidion, has been newly elected “Plant community of the Year 2022”. In this review article, we provide an overview of the Caucalidion in Germany, its species composition, life cycle and biodiversity, distribution, habitat and phytosociological variation, its history, reasons of decline, and conservation management both at present and in view of future options. The Caucalidion is a well-defined alliance characterized by more than 50 plant species in Germany alone, alas a majority of them is now scarce and listed in the national Red Data Book. Caucalidion vegetation has been associated with grain farming since as early as the Bronze Age, although its species composition has altered over time due to changes in crop species, tillage and farming technology. Generally, the number and proportion of segetal plants in grain fields has increased. However, the past decades have seen an unprecedented intensification and increase in production of arable farming, yet to the cost of soil health, diversity and abundance of wildlife. Most characteristic species of the Caucalidion are archaeophytes, some of which accompanying arable farming since millennia, others since mediaeval times. However, the plant species pool typical of calcareous fields in Germany (comprising more than 150 species sufficiently frequent to occur in at least 10 % of the – historical – relevés in at least one region or community association) consists of at least 55 % native plant species. The Caucalidion has a European (warm-)temperate, suboceanic to subcontinental distribution area, from the British Isles to southern Sweden, and from Central Spain to the surroundings of the Black Sea. It is mainly distributed in South-Central European and sub-Mediterranean regions. In Germany, it occurs at all altitudinal belts that support agriculture, and covers all productivity classes of arable soil including the top high-yield sites. Three plant community types (associations) of the Caucalidion occur in Germany: The Fluellen community (Kickxietum spuriae) reaches the country in the west and is found on thick calcareous loams and clays under suboceanic conditions. The community named after Night-flowering Catchfly (Euphorbio exiguae-Melandrietum noctiflori) occurs on deep loess and chernozem as well as calcaric cambisols mostly in the north of the Caucalidion distribution area. Finally, the more southerly distributed Bur-parsley community (Caucalido platycarpi-Conringietum orientalis) depends on often thin calcareous clay loams under warmer and drier conditions. Caucalidion vegetation is currently associated almost entirely with autumn-sown cereal varieties, but until in the recent past spring-sown cereals have also been common on calcareous fields. The rhythm of arable plant growth determines the food resources on cultivated lands. In the Caucalidion, as in other plant communities of arable fields, annual plants dominate, comprising a mixture of life cycles including autumn-germinating and springgerminating plants as well as others that may germinate anytime when conditions are favourable. Historical relevés of the 1950s to 1970s reveal mean total cover values of arable plants of 35 to over 40 %, approximating the crop cover values. Published references to arable weeds by botanists of the 18th and 19th century highlight the local abundance of Caucalidion plants including species known as being extremely rare today. The variety of arable plants throughout the year with their leaves, buds, flowers, pollen, nectar and seeds satisfies the dietary needs of all kinds of arable wildlife, provided that cereal stubbles are left after harvest as stubble-fields support late flowering and fruiting plants essential for seed-eating birds and other fauna. Pollinators are represented in arable fields by both generalists and specialists such as wild bees feeding exclusively on Sinapis arvensis or Convolvulus arvensis, respectively, both common and locally abundant in Caucalidion fields. The 19th and early 20th century losses of the arable flora were due to more and more efficient seed cleaning, changes in crop rotation with loss of fallow, and increasing mechanization. This process accelerated towards the end of the 20th century by revolutionary changes in arable farming methods, including massive increases in the application of agrochemicals such as herbicides and artificial nitrogen fertiliser, and the loss of crop stubbles in the autumn and winter. In the past decades, species-rich Caucalidion vegetation together with its farmland wildlife has drastically declined to mostly tiny areas extant only in scattered field margins. Conservation management of field margin strips, set up for the first time in the late 1970s in the Eifel Mountains by the initiative of Wolfgang Schumacher, is now safeguarded by various biodiversity action plans in the federal states providing financial compensation to contractual farmers for production losses. Despite the success of programmes devoted to the conservation management of field margin strips rich in Caucalidion species their future development may be bleak due to discontinuation of the programmes and compensatory payments, competing – and eventually more profitable – agri-environment schemes, the ongoing abandonment of unproductive fields, and increasingly the use of even such fields for energy crop cultivation. Recent evidence highlights the importance of habitat continuity for rare Caucalidion plant species. Changes in the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy are urgently needed to improve the future situation of agro-ecosystems. Current negotiations and subsequent national implementation should prioritize environmental services of farmland management against unbalanced conventional agriculture directed only to yield maximisation and increasingly to the profits of outside farmland investors. Economic incentives should be directed towards a substantial increase in the proportion of organic farming and to implement a network of sites of nature conservation importance, arable plant sanctuaries in farmed fields at the landscape level, across agricultural regions. They represent focus areas for the local arable wildlife species pool and may serve as reservoirs for rare species selected for re-introduction in surrounding landscapes where they are gone. The authors of this review article consider the election of the Caucalidion as “Plant community of the Year 2022” as supportive for stakeholders active in improving conditions for soil and biodiversity protection through sustainable farming and arable plant conservation management at local, national and international levels, and especially acknowledge the years-long successful conservation efforts of numerous contract farmers participating in agri-environment programmes supporting our arable flora and wildlife. © 2021},

abstract={Ecosystem anthropization is a main driver of biodiversity loss, but not all species are equally susceptible. Understanding and preventing biodiversity loss is particularly important in rapidly changing and biodiversity-rich areas like the Neotropics and requires exploring the role of both intrinsic and extrinsic vulnerability drivers. Here, we test how multiple potential intrinsic and extrinsic factors explain vulnerability to extinction in neotropical birds to provide a first insight into what makes these species susceptible to extinction and how they are responding to anthropization. Our analyses included data for 2268 neotropical birds. We characterized extinction risk based on the IUCN Red List categorization and tested the predictive value of seven intrinsic and four extrinsic variables using Bayesian MCMC Phylogenetic Generalized Least-Squares (PGLS) models. As hypothesized, we found higher intrinsic vulnerability to extinction among bigger and more specialized species which have low reproductive output and occupy smaller distribution ranges. Extrinsic drivers were also relevant predictors with more threatened species overlapping largely areas with fewer human activities (lower night light levels and lower human population densities). Our results show that the extinction risk of neotropical birds is correlated with both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic vulnerabilities were as expected associated with narrower, specialized niches and slower life histories. However, risk was not higher in more humanized environments, but instead more at-risk species were found in less disturbed areas that we suggest may represent refuges for birds that previously occurred in wider ranges and have now been excluded from the more anthropized regions. Our results contribute to our understanding of vulnerability predictors in birds and provide a first evaluation of neotropical birds that highlights the complex relationship between human pressure and biodiversity loss. © 2021, Resilience Alliance.

abstract={Freshwater ecosystems have a greater value for biodiversity per surface area than terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Streams and lakes are notably prone to biodiversity loss, being the greatest threats habitat destructions and nonnative species. The aim of the present study is to assess the fish composition of lotic and lentic water systems of an island ecosystem (Gökçeada Island, Turkey), which is poorly studied, and to highlight the entry routes and possible impacts of translocated fish species in an island ecosystem. The field surveys were conducted in a total of 14 sampling sites (five reservoirs and nine streams) in the inland waters of Gökçeada Island between September 2019 and January 2021. Fish samples were collected by electrofishing (SAMUS 1000; a backpack electro-shocker). A total of eight fish species belonging to six families (Anguillidae, Atherinidae, Cyprinidae, Leuciscidae, Mugilidae, and Poeciliidae) were determined. As a result fish community of the island was mostly composed by the introduced species Carassius gibelio, Gambusia holbrooki and Pseudorasbora parva. This study provides the first detailed information on the distribution of the fish species encountered in the inland waters of Gökçeada Island. Results showed that the fish fauna of the island was predominantly shaped by fish stocking activities. © TÜBİTAK.},

abstract={More than a third of the world's amphibian species are listed as Threatened or Extinct, with a recent assessment identifying 45 Australian frogs (18.4% of the currently recognised species) as 'Threatened' based on IUCN criteria. We applied structured expert elicitation to 26 frogs assessed as Critically Endangered and Endangered to estimate their probability of extinction by 2040. We also investigated whether participant experience (measured as a self-assigned categorical score, i.e. 'expert' or 'non-expert') influenced the estimates. Collation and analysis of participant opinion indicated that eight species are at high risk (>50% chance) of becoming extinct by 2040, with the disease chytridiomycosis identified as the primary threat. A further five species are at moderate-high risk (30-50% chance), primarily due to climate change. Fourteen of the 26 frog species are endemic to Queensland, with many species restricted to small geographic ranges that are susceptible to stochastic events (e.g. a severe heatwave or a large bushfire). Experts were more likely to rate extinction probability higher for poorly known species (those with <10 experts), while non-experts were more likely to rate extinction probability higher for better-known species. However, scores converged following discussion, indicating that there was greater consensus in the estimates of extinction probability. Increased resourcing and management intervention are urgently needed to avert future extinctions of Australia's frogs. Key priorities include developing and supporting captive management and establishing or extending in-situ population refuges to alleviate the impacts of disease and climate change. © 2021 Journal Compilation},

abstract={Urbanization is one of the major causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. Some species are able to adapt to urbanization, whereas others perish. Studies on long-term effects of the impact of urbanization on species diversity and abundance patterns are especially lacking from tropical cities. We seek to assess the relationship between urbanization and species richness of lake-dependent birds in Bangalore, a tropical mega-city in Southern India. We specifically ask: (i) How is bird species richness related to the size of the lake? (ii) How is bird species richness in Bangalore's lakes related to the degree of urbanization? We used data from 2014 to 2019, collected from eBird - an online database that collates information on bird observations globally. Both lake area and distance from the city centre are correlated to species richness, with larger lakes supporting more bird species. As distance from the city centre increased (i.e. urbanization decreases), bird richness increased. Overall, in the city of Bangalore, migratory birds have declined while many lake-dependent resident birds seem to be increasing over the past 5 years. We hypothesize that birds that roost and nest in trees appear to be increasing. To confirm this, further research taking a trait-based approach is required. Urbanization appears to have species-specific impacts on lake-dependent birds in this tropical city, with certain groups of birds faring better than others. This research adds to the significant paucity of studies of the impact of urbanization on biodiversity in the urban tropics. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.},

abstract={This study evaluated fish beta diversity in six headwater creeks located in the area affected by the largest ornamental aquaculture center implemented in the Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. We sampled fish assemblages in 2017 and 2018 to investigate changes in assemblage structure (species richness and beta diversity), comparing these data with the historic species pool. We recorded 60 fish species, of which 16 were native and 44 non-native with 19 translocated, and 25 exotic. The exotics Poecilia reticulata, Xiphophorus maculatus, X. variatus, Danio rerio, and Misgurnus anguillicaudatus were the most widely distributed in the headwater creeks. The Contamination Index showed that most creeks had high proportional contamination by exotic species (above 60%). Beta diversity increased from historical to contemporary periods in all creeks due to the introduction and differential colonization pressure of several non-native translocated and exotic species, indicating biotic differentiation. Temperature and number of ponds were the main preditors of change in beta diversity in the headwater creeks during the contemporary period. In summary, we observed that invaders have induced substantial changes to fish communities under influence of environmental filters. Our results support the hipothesis that aquaculture is a main driver of fish non-native fish introduction and native biodiversity loss in the Neotropics. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Ictiologia.

abstract={We report cases of live bait introductions in Brazilian freshwater ecosystems and the first occurrence of the crab Dilocarcinus pagei, which is native from the Paraguay-Lower Paraná River, in the Paranapanema River basin. The literature review revealed 16 species used as live baits across Brazil, the crab D. pagei and 15 fish species. During our field samplings, we have captured 10 individuals of D. pagei. Gymnotiformes, which is native mainly from the Paraguay-Lower Paraná River, was the most common fish order that was used as live bait. The river basins that had introduction cases detected in our study were Upper Paraná, Iguaçu, and Paraíba do Sul Rivers. The Paraguay-Lower Paraná River was the system that had contributed with nine species to the most invaded ecoregion in Brazil, the Upper Paraná River basin. Anglers and live bait farmers should be aware of the risks and consequences of these constant introductions. In addition, the live bait trade must be monitored and controlled to use only native species within their original distribution range. © 2021, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

abstract={Biological invasions, as a result of human intervention through trade and mobility, are the second biggest cause of biodiversity loss. The impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) on the environment are well known, however, economic impacts are poorly estimated, especially in mega-diverse countries where both economic and ecological consequences of these effects can be catastrophic. Ecuador, one of the smallest mega-diverse countries, lacks a comprehensive description of the economic costs of IAS within its territory. Here, using "InvaCost", a public database that compiles all recorded monetary costs associated with IAS from English and Non-English sources, we investigated the economic costs of biological invasions. We found that between 1983 and 2017, the reported costs associated with biological invasions ranged between US$86.17 million (when considering only the most robust data) and US$626 million (when including all cost data) belonging to 37 species and 27 genera. Furthermore, 99% of the recorded cost entries were from the Galapagos Islands. From only robust data, the costliest identified taxonomic group was feral goats (Capra hircus; US$20 million), followed by Aedes mosquitoes (US$2.14 million) while organisms like plant species from the genus Rubus, a parasitic fly (Philornis downsi), black rats (Rattus rattus) and terrestrial gastropods (Achatina fulica) represented less than US$2 million each. Costs of "mixed-taxa" (i.e. plants and animals) represented the highest (61% of total robust costs; US$52.44 million). The most impacted activity sector was the national park authorities, which spent about US$84 million. Results from robust data also revealed that management expenditures were the major type of costs recorded in the Galapagos Islands; however, costs reported for medical losses related to Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue fever in mainland Ecuador would have ranked first if more detailed information had allowed us to categorize them as robust data. Over 70% of the IAS reported for Ecuador did not have reported costs. These results suggest that costs reported here are a massive underestimate of the actual economic toll of invasions in the country. © 2021 Liliana Ballesteros-Mejia et al. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Invasive alien species (IAS) are a leading driver of biodiversity loss worldwide, and have negative impacts on human societies. In most countries, available data on monetary costs of IAS are scarce, while being crucial for developing efficient management. In this study, we use available data collected from the first global assessment of economic costs of IAS (InvaCost) to quantify and describe the economic cost of invasions in Mexico. This description was made across a range of taxonomic, sectoral and temporal variables, and allowed us to identify knowledge gaps within these areas. Overall, costs of invasions in Mexico were estimated at US$ 5.33 billion (i.e., 109) ($MXN 100.84 billion) during the period from 1992 to 2019. Biological invasion costs were split relatively evenly between aquatic (US$ 1.16 billion; $MXN 21.95 billion) and terrestrial (US$ 1.17 billion; $MXN 22.14 billion) invaders, but semi-aquatic taxa dominated (US$ 2.99 billion; $MXN 56.57 billion), with costs from damages to resources four times higher than those from management of IAS (US$ 4.29 billion vs. US$ 1.04 billion; $MXN 81.17 billion vs $MXN 19.68 billion). The agriculture sector incurred the highest costs (US$ 1.01 billion; $MXN 19.1 billion), followed by fisheries (US$ 517.24 million; $MXN 9.79 billion), whilst most other costs simultaneously impacted mixed or unspecified sectors. When defined, costs to Mexican natural protected areas were mostly associated with management actions in terrestrial environments, and were incurred through official authorities via monitoring, control or eradication. On natural protected islands, mainly mammals were managed (i.e. rodents, cats and goats), to a total of US$ 3.99 million, while feral cows, fishes and plants were mostly managed in protected mainland areas, amounting to US$ 1.11 million in total. Pterygopli-chthys sp. and Eichhornia crassipes caused the greatest reported costs in unprotected aquatic ecosystems in Mexico, and Bemisia tabaci to terrestrial systems. Although reported damages from invasions appeared to be fluctuating through time in Mexico, management spending has been increasing. These estimates, albeit conservative, underline the monetary pressure that invasions put on the Mexican economy, calling for urgent actions alongside comprehensive cost reporting in national states such as Mexico. © 2021 Axel Eduardo Rico-Sánchez et al.

abstract={In the Anthropocene, humans are changing and harming the planet in significant and possibly irreversible ways. Biodiversity loss is one of the main elements of these human-caused harms. Wildlife and conservation policies, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (the Bern Convention) are attempts to stop the loss of wildlife albeit in different ways (i.e., control of trade versus habitat protection). This article explores the implementation of both of these conventions in the UK through a mixed-methods study including content analysis of convention documentation and eight semi-structured interviews. The findings indicate that whilst the UK has a reputation for actively engaging in wildlife conservation and being a nation of animal lovers, management of its own wildlife is under resourced and could be improved. Both conventions are complex, with different parties focusing on different aspects. Stakeholders need to engage in dialogue about the core ethical issues regarding trade and consumption. Trying to expect the inclusion of or to add on species justice and welfare to the existing structures appears to be a step too far for the stakeholders as well as the legislative structures. © 2021 Universitat Rovira i Virgili.

abstract={It is anticipated that climate change will cause biodiversity loss by altering natural habitats and species distribution. The main purpose of the study was to model the current and future distribution of Axis porcinus to predict the changes in their habitat in Punjab, Pakistan. A Total of 32 variables including bioclimatic, natural, topographical and human impact variables were prepared. Dimension reduction was done by three methods, namely the Pearson’s correlation, multi-collinearity analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) to achieve the appropriate number of predictors. The study predicted the potential distribution of species by the 2050s and 2070s under representative concentrative pathways (RCPs) RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate change scenarios using earth observations and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) machine learning model. Results revealed that highly suitable areas for current distribution of Axis porcinus cover 451.3 Km2. According to future projections suitable habitat will face an 18.7% decline by 2050s according to RCP 4.5 scenario or 52.8% based on the RCP 8.5 scenario which is alarming and protection measures are crucial. Based on the current and future distribution of the species, three priority conservation areas covering 632 Km2 for Axis porcinus are identified. This study supports the formulation of current conservation policies and strategies for protection of the species keeping in view the impact of climate change scenarios. © 2021, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={Anthropogenic activities are a matter of serious concern in the Indian Himalayan region due to adverse impacts on wildlife and habitats. This study examines resource use patterns by local people in relation to the habitat of Malayan Sun Bear in and around Dampa Tiger Reserve in Mizoram. Standard questionnaire surveys and vegetation sampling methods were used for data collection and analysis. It was found that 221.3 km2 (33.3%) of the forested areas have high human interference in the form of logging, indiscriminate tree falling and fuel wood collection, while 26% was moderately affected and 18% of the reserve had no impact. Among vegetation resources, fuel wood was used in the highest quantity (28%) followed by bamboo and edible plants (21%) and (11%), respectively. Ethno-zoological usage comprises of parts of animals like snake, bear, monitor lizard, and porcupine. Sun bears were considered pests that feed on maize, cucumber, sweet potato and pumpkins grown in ‘jhum' crop fields. Anthropogenic pressures from farm-bush hunting, monoculture, and unplanned roads have contributed to severe biodiversity loss, and must be constrained for the conservation of sun bear and their habitat in the region. The Land Use/ Land Cover on human built-up, jhum land (current and abandoned jhum/shifting cultivation), forests (dense and open), bamboo forest, plantation etc. were used to develop maps for each village. The land use pattern for the eight villages studied. Information obtained from MIRSAC and its mapping in Arcview shows that highest number of agricultural land was in villages of West Phaileng (319sq.ha) and Damparengpui (283.8sq.ha). Closed or dense forest was in highest proportion in Phuldungsei and least in Tuipuibari (120sq.ha). Grazing activities was relatively low or absent in most part of DTR. Abandoned jhum fields were in largest number in Damparengpui (939.60sq.ha) followed by Silsuri (881.17sq.ha) and Serhmun (880.99sq.ha). © 2021 Gouda et al. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Madagascar has historically suffered from high fragmentation of forested habitats, often leading to biodiversity loss. Neverthless, forest fragments still retain high levels of biological diversity. The Haute Matsiatra Region (south-eastern Madagascar) hosts the renowned Andringitra National Park and several surrounding isolated forest fragments embedded in a matrix of human-dominated landscape. During a herpetological survey conducted in the Region, we visited a total of 25 sites. We applied a molecular taxonomic approach to identify the collected material and generate new reference sequences to improve the molecular identification of Malagasy herpetofauna. We identified a total of 28 amphibian and 38 squamate taxa and provided a systematic account for each one of them. Nine of the identified taxa are candidate species, amongst which one was newly identified. We extended the known distributional range of 21 taxa (nine amphibians and 12 squamates). Although the largest forest fragments hold a higher number of species, we also detected a relatively high herpetological diversity in small patches. Our results highlight the importance of investigating small forest fragments to contribute to a better understanding of the patterns of diversity and distribution of the amphibians and reptiles of Madagascar.

abstract={The pathogenic chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal) cause infections that have become primary drivers of amphibian biodiversity loss. While globally widespread, the distribution margins of Bd and Bsal have not been determined, and the presence of these pathogens has probably gone unnoticed in many areas, especially in northern Eurasia. To better understand the presence and distribution of both pathogens in the northern temperate and boreal forest biomes, 243 individuals were sampled from 8 native amphibian species across Estonia. Additionally, 68 amphibians were sampled from captive collections in Estonia and Latvia. Pathogen infection was assessed using metabarcoding of the ITS2 marker. No positive matches for Bsal infection were found. Bd was detected in 13 specimens, 3 of which were sampled at the Riga Zoo (with a prevalence of 5.2%) and 10 in natural environments in Estonia (3.3%). The infected wild individuals belonged to 6 amphibian species and were detected throughout the mainland of Estonia, but not on islands. Prevalence of infection with Bd ranged between 3.1 and 12.5% among native species. In addition, we found molecular evidence for a potentially new sister species to Bd in nature. Although outbreaks of chytridiomycosis have never been observed in Estonia, it cannot be excluded that the dynamics of local amphibian populations are affected by Bd infections. Therefore, further work, including capture-mark-recapture studies and long-term monitoring, are required to clarify the impact of Bd on amphibians in Northern Europe. © 2021 Inter-Research.

abstract={Biological invasions are among the main causes of biodiversity loss on planet. Losses are accentuated in streams, which are sensitive to human impacts, since they have specialized fauna and higher degree of endemism. Despite this, studies on invasions by non-native fishes in streams are incipient in Brazil. In this review, we present an introduction on the process (i.e., stages) of biological invasion, the environmental factors that influence the establishment and the impacts of non-native species in streams. A methodological step-by-step is also presented as a way to guide the conduct of studies on non-native species in Brazilian streams. In addition, management actions measures are presented to prevent new cases of introductions and suggestions for studies on invasions in streams. Avoiding propagule pressure and environmental education, as well as legal aspects of Brazilian legislation, are management actions that can prevent new introductions. Finally, gaps in knowledge and perspectives are raised as an incentive for interested parties to enter the subject and develop new studies on non-native fishes in Brazilian streams. © 2021, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

abstract={Introduction: One of the significant threats to aquatic ecosystems is introducing non-native species in natural environments. This represents one of the principal causes of biodiversity loss in the world. Pangasianodon hypophthalmus is an introduced species in Colombia that shares life characteristics and habitat with endangered native species, such as Ageneiosus pardalis, Sorubim cuspicaudus, and Pseudoplatystoma magdaleniatum. However, its distribution is little-known, and scientists have barely explored the effects on the native fauna. Objectives: To evaluate the P. hypophthalmus invasive potential in some of the Colombian basins, which drain into the Caribbean Sea. Methods: Using records available in various databases, we performed a niche conservatism analysis between the native and introduced records of P. hypophthalmus using the R package Ecospat. Subsequently, we modeled the potential invasion area of P. hypophthalmus and the distribution areas of three native species, performing ecological niche modeling (ENM) using the Maxent algorithm. Finally, we calculated a geographic niche overlap between the non-native and native species. Results: The Ecospat spatial analysis indicated that P. hypophthalmus retains some environmental niche attributes through space. For this reason, we can use ENM as an approximation to its range of distribution in the invaded area. Our results using ENM demonstrated that the four species analyzed prefer low and slightly rocky regions; therefore, the geographical overlap of the three native species’ ecological niches and the introduced species exceed 80 %. Conclusions: There are adequate conditions in the study basins to fully establish the species P. hypophthalmus, representing a high risk for aquatic ecosystems and native ichthyofauna. Knowledge of the potential distribution areas is essential to implement control of the species. © 2021, Universidad de Costa Rica. All rights reserved.},

abstract={For several decades, both academics and practitioners have fiercely debated how to reconcile conservation and development objectives. In Sub-Saharan Africa, efforts to align biodiversity conservation and livelihood goals have triggered a shift from pure protected area approaches to a hybrid scenario, including diverse partnership arrangements, that consider livelihood needs of communities neighboring protected areas. These partnerships often include tourism to provide income and jobs. The future of the Amboseli landscape in Kenya has been an integral part of these debates, since it has faced long-lasting conservation and development challenges. Many initiatives, often in the form of partnership arrangements, have tried to address these challenges. By using the Sustainable Livelihood Framework (SLF) and a set of indicators to measure the contributions to conservation, we examine two of these partnerships—the Amboseli Ecosystem Trust (AET) and Big Life Foundation (BLF)—with the aim of understanding the extent to which they contribute to addressing these challenges. Data were collected using document analysis, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, nonparticipant observation, and informal conversations. Findings show that both AET and BLF have been able to address direct drivers of biodiversity loss (such as human wildlife conflicts, poaching, unplanned infrastructural developments) and—to a much lesser extent—the indirect drivers, such as poverty and land subdivision. Through the workings of both partnerships, more community members have gained access to specific community capital assets, through employment opportunities and other monetary incentives and education. However, it is not clear if and how the livelihood benefits transfer to real and long-term support for wildlife conservation. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Chytridiomycosis, an emergent infectious disease caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is considered one of the drivers of the current amphibian biodiversity loss. To inform endangered species conservation efforts, it is essential to improve our knowledge about the abiotic and biotic factors that influence Bd infection dynamics in the wild. Here, we analyzed variation of Bd infection in the redbelly toad Melanophryniscus montevidensis, a threatened bufonid from Uruguay. We tested the influence of temperature, precipitation, season, and host population size on Bd prevalence and intensity. Additionally, considering the sublethal effects of Bd, we tested if these variables, potentially through their effect on Bd, also explain the variation in host body condition. We determined a high Bd prevalence of 41% (100/241), and that population size influenced both Bd prevalence and infection intensity. We identified an effect of precipitation and season on Bd infection intensity and an effect of season on toad body condition. In addition, we found a negative effect of infection intensity on body condition; moreover, while some toads cleared the infection, their body condition did not improve, suggesting a longterm cost. This is the first report on host population size as an important factor in Bd infection dynamics in a threatened anuran species, and seasonal demographic changes appear to play an important role in the dynamics. Finally, we highlight the need for monitoring Bd in this and other endangered amphibian populations, especially those within the genus Melanophryniscus, which includes several Endangered and Data Deficient species in South America. © Inter-Research 2021.},

abstract={Wildlife trading and the illegal hunting of wildlife are contributing factors to the biodiversity crisis that is presently unfolding across the world. The inability to control the trade of animal body parts or available biological materials is a major challenge for those who investigate wildlife crime. The effective management of this illegal trade is an important facet of wildlife forensic sciences and can be a key factor in the enforcement of effective legislation surrounding the illegal trade of protected and endangered species. However, the science of wildlife forensics is limited by the absence of a comprehensive database for wildlife investigations. Inter-simple sequence repeat markers (ISSR) coupled with high resolution melting analysis (HRM) have been effectively used for species identification of 38 mammalian species. Six primers of the ISSR markers were chosen for species identification analysis. From six ISSR primers resulting in a range of accuracy of 33.3%–100% and 100% in terms of precision in every primer. Furthermore, 161 mammalian samples were 100% distinguished to the correct species using these six ISSR primers. ISSR-HRM analysis was successfully employed in determining mammal identification among varying mammalian species, and thus could serve as an effective alternative tool or technique in the species identification process. This option would offer researchers a heightened level of convenience in terms of its performance and the ease with which researchers or field practice veterinarians would be able to interpret results in effectively identifying animal parts at wildlife investigation crime scenes. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={Biodiversity loss has multiple causes, but habitat degradation through land-use change is the predominant driver. We investigated the effectiveness of the Natura 2000 network in preserving the main wetlands of the two largest islands of the Mediterranean region, whose conservation is critical for many avian species at European and global level, in a 23-year period (1990–2012). In Sardinia, the surroundings of 22 wetlands were affected by an increase in artificial areas (+64 ha/year) and decrease in agricultural (−54 ha/year) and natural (−17 ha/year) ones. In Sicily, the surroundings of 16 wetlands were impacted by an increase in agricultural areas (+50 ha/year) and decrease in natural and semi-natural ones (−62 ha/year). Results show that the Natura 2000 policies were effective in preserving wetlands (no shrinkages detected in both regions), but their surroundings experienced intense processes of degradation and artificialization in all the sub-periods considered (1990–2000, 2000–2006, 2006–2012), whose effects are now threatening waterbirds and wetland integrity. The enlargement of the existing Natura 2000 sites, the creation of new ones and the speedup of the application of the rules of the Habitats and Birds Directives seem necessary to counteract the rapid land-use changes around these important stopover sites. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Non-indigenous fish species (NIFS) can cause severe ecological impacts on the invaded ecosystems and are considered as one of the leading factors of freshwater biodiversity loss. Unravel-ing the spatial overlap between NIFS and critically endangered (CR) fish species can contribute to targeted conservation actions to minimize the potential negative effects. In this study, we applied geostatistical analyses to investigate the spatial overlap of NIFS against fish species that are desig-nated under the CR status according to the IUCN and the Hellenic Zoological Society (HZS) Red Lists. Distributional data (presence–absence) from 800 records of 52 NIFS were compiled for both lentic and lotic ecosystems of Greece. Our results indicate that freshwater ecosystems under high NIFS richness were located mainly in lowland areas and often near large cities and ecosystems with well-developed commercial and recreational fisheries. On the contrary, low NIFS richness was ob-served in mountainous regions and in relatively small river basins. Overlapping areas of CR species with moderate to high NIFS richness (1.5–4.3 NIFS per 1 km2 ) were relatively high (~50%). A quarter of the overlapping areas (24.8%) fall within NATURA 2000 network, where legal management bodies could implement specialized programs to minimize the negative impacts. However, the majority of CR fish species’ distribution remains in unprotected areas indicating that protected areas should be re-designed to include areas containing freshwater species under the highest threatened category. Our findings demonstrate that whole assemblages of fishes are rapidly changing as NIFS spread into Greece and many freshwater ecosystems of outstanding biodiversity conservation value are under significant invasion pressure. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Neotropical snakes have extremely low detection rates, hampering our understanding of their responses to habitat loss and fragmentation. We addressed this gap using a limited sample (50 individuals, 16 species) across 25 variable-size insular forest fragments within a hydroelectric lake and four adjacent mainland continuous forest sites, in Central Brazilian Amazonia. The number of species recorded on forest islands (1.55 (Formula presented.) 0.78) was much lower than that at continuous forest sites (5.0 (Formula presented.) 3.1), with no snakes being recorded at twelve islands smaller than 30 ha. As such, snake assemblages were positively affected by forest area, explaining 48% of the number of species, and negatively affected by island isolation. The markedly higher number of species recorded across continuous forest sites likely results from the availability of riparian habitats, which have virtually disappeared from the archipelagic landscape given the widespread inundation of lowland areas. To prevent further severe biodiversity loss, including those of poorly known rare taxa, conservation policies should avert the additional construction of mega-dams that create myriad of small islands, in addition to extensive reservoir lakes from which all riparian habitats are eliminated. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={There is a current global biodiversity loss at a rate 100 to 1000 times greater than the rate of natural extinction. Human activity, specifically human population growth and the necessary actions to sustain them, has led to habitat destruction, the rise of invasive species, climate change, and over exploitation of natural resources. In South Africa, an increasing number of nonhuman primates have entered into rehabilitation centers due to animal-human conflicts. The high accumulation of these primates has led to an increase in the need for group formation and releases at rehabilitation centers. Although the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has published generic guidelines for the release of nonhuman primates, it recommends species-specific guidelines be published for optimal release success. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of following best practice management approaches to maximize conservation efforts and individual welfare of displaced species, while also aiming to provide guidance on the best practice approaches. To date, there are only a few published species-specific rehabilitation and release protocols for primates. We, therefore, created species-specific guidelines for the rehabilitation of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) for reinforcement. The proposed guidelines are based on psychological well-being, social and individual behaviors, and the ecology of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) for rehabilitation, release, and post-release assessments. Our guidelines include seven distinct steps: Arrival, conspecific resocialization, housing, training, and preparation, pre-release assessment, release-site selection, release, and post-release assessment. We provide detailed information and examples of each step based on the protocols from the Riverside Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre (Riverside), a rehabilitation center in the Limpopo province of South Africa that has had successful rehabilitation and release projects for chacma baboons, among other primates. Since rehabilitation centers are limited by factors such as location and resources, this is meant to be a "best practice" model for this specific baboon species. The goal of these guidelines is to help assist future rehabilitation and releases, as well as provide a foundation to those who wish to modify the guidelines to create other speciesspecific rehabilitation steps. © 2021 Global Wildlife Conservation.

abstract={The development of eco-sanctuaries has been an important response to the biodiversity crisis in New Zealand. They combine intensive predator control and biodiversity conservation, with a particular focus on endangered endemic wildlife within the local ecosystems. Tourism has been harnessed to fund conservation efforts, raising important questions about the experiences of visitors to eco-sanctuaries. This paper explores international visitors’ perceptions and experiences of ecological restoration at New Zealand eco-sanctuaries. Theoretically framed by the field of environmental philosophy, we present an analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted with international visitors to eco-sanctuaries. Our findings identified competing interests among humans, endemic wildlife, invasive animals and the wider biological community tied to visitor perceptions of ecological restoration. These perceptions are largely found to be shaped by the interplay between environmental ethics and relevant awareness/knowledge of international visitors. The research contributes to emerging trans-disciplinary discourses that address tourism and environmental philosophy by offering an environmental ethics-awareness/knowledge framework to elucidate different visitor mindsets, with implications drawn for their distinct and nuanced experiences at the eco-sanctuaries. It also sheds light on the demand side of nature-based tourism by interrogating the perceived intrinsic value of the natural world and the potential of aesthetic value in conservation management. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The ongoing climate change and the unprecedented rate of biodiversity loss render the need to accurately project future species distributional patterns more critical than ever. Mounting evidence suggests that not only abiotic factors, but also biotic interactions drive broad-scale distributional patterns. Here, we explored the effect of predator-prey interaction on the predator distribution, using as target species the widespread and generalist grass snake (Natrix natrix). We used ensemble Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) to build a model only with abiotic variables (abiotic model) and a biotic one including prey species richness. Then we projected the future grass snake distribution using a modest emission scenario assuming an unhindered and no dispersal scenario. The two models performed equally well, with temperature and prey species richness emerging as the top drivers of species distribution in the abiotic and biotic models, respectively. In the future, a severe range contraction is anticipated in the case of no dispersal, a likely possibility as reptiles are poor dispersers. If the species can disperse freely, an improbable scenario due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it will lose part of its contemporary distribution, but it will expand northwards. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Freshwater biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene escalates the need for successful environmental water management to sustain human benefitting ecosystem services. Of the world’s river basins, one-third are now severely water depleted, rendering the quality and quantity of water to maintain or restore freshwater ecosystem integrity increasingly urgent. However, managing environmental water is intricate because of complexity and uncertainty in interacting social and biophysical system components, and trade-offs between costs and benefits of implementing environmental flows. Learning enabled adaptive management – embracing the uncertainty – is essential; however, practising adaptive management (worldwide) is challenging; single-, double-and triple-loop learning is required, along with social learning, to tackle complex problems. There is progressive realisation of environmental flows (Ecological Reserve) in the Crocodile River, South Africa, linked to the Kruger National Park, using Strategic Adaptive Management (SAM). In this research article, we reflected on adaptive (single-and double-loop) learning and transformative (triple-loop) learning capacity emergent in SAM between 2009 and 2019 whilst also considering social learning potentials. We found evidence of preconditions (e.g. transparency) for social learning within a burgeoning stakeholder ‘community-of-practice’, likely fostering capacities (e.g. information sharing) for sustained social learning. Adaptive and transformative learning is enabled by social learning, underpinned by ongoing nested feedbacks supporting assessment and reflection, which facilitates single-, double-and triple-loop learning. Champions exist and are vital for sustaining the adaptive management system. Executing adaptive and transformative learning aids in positive change across the range of ecological, social and economic outcomes that are essential for success in environmental water programmes, worldwide. Conservation implications: Crocodile River Ecological Reserve implementation, associated with Kruger National Park, provided an important national precedent (lessons) for protecting the ecological integrity of river systems – obligatory under the National Water Act (Act No 36 of 1998). We demonstrated the importance of ongoing stakeholder learning for successful management of the Ecological Reserve. © 2021. The Authors.},

abstract={Large terrestrial wildlife negatively impacts agricultural livelihoods on all continents except Antarctica. There is growing recognition of the need to reconcile these impacts to achieve socially and ecologically sustainable wildlife conservation agendas. Elk populations in northern California are estimated to have doubled in the past 35 years, marking a conservation success, but also increasing forage loss and damage to infrastructure on private land. Wildlife managers are pursuing the goal of increasing elk numbers on public lands, but elk are preferentially utilizing private pasture and rangeland, driving conflict with beef and dairy producers. We conducted 17 semistructured interviews with private landowners, primarily beef and dairy producers, in northern California to understand their experiences and reactions to elk conflict and state wildlife management. Landowners report that elk density on private rangeland has steadily increased in recent years and poses a threat to their businesses due to loss of forage, damage to fences, and the corresponding liability risk posed by breached fences and errant cattle. The absence of crop and forage loss compensation, difficulty obtaining depredation permits, and low harvest quotas for recreational hunting limit landowner mitigation options and foster resentment toward the state wildlife agency. Most landowners believe that current elk management policies, including restricted hunting opportunities, do not adequately address elk conflict, creating novel challenges for wildlife officials tasked with reconciling elk restoration goals with a variety of stakeholders experiencing economic losses and threats to rural livelihoods. We discuss these issues in the context of common wildlife management challenges, such as building social capital, defining tolerable impacts, and building institutional capacity for alternative solutions within rigid regulatory frameworks. We draw upon environmental economics and common-pool resource theory to suggest that a rethinking of elk management based on local conditions, facilitating damage compensation mechanisms while reducing transaction costs, and increasing participation of local stakeholders in decision making might improve outcomes. © 2021 by the author(s).

abstract={Spatial and temporal variations in the diet of the Eurasian Kestrel Fa/co tinnuncu-lus in the Western Palearctic. A meta-analysis on the Eurasian Kestrel Falco tinnunculus diet in the Western Paleartic was conducted using 59 studies published between 1935 and 2018 with a total sample of 84,778 prey items. Surprisingly, no differences were observed, on average, between diet compositions (% prey eaten and biomass ingested) between rural and unban areas. In contrast, geographical differences occur with more invertebrates and fewer mammals in mediterranean regions and few birds in northern regions, validating a latitudinal gradient in the diet of the Kestrel, for prey species and biomass. Temporal variations occur significantly only in the southern part of the distribution while no clear trends were observed in northern part. Diet variations are discussed in the light of recent and massive decline of biodiversity and particularly of the potential main food sources of kestrels, i.e mammals, birds and invertebrates. Kestrels may probably respond to the loss of biodiversity in their breeding distribution range by reducing densities of breeding populations. © 2021 Societe d'Etudes Ornithologiques.

abstract={In the context of global biodiversity loss, wildlife population monitoring is a major challenge. Some innovative techniques such as the use of drones-also called unmanned aerial vehicle/system (UAV/UAS)-offer promising opportunities. The potential of UAS-based wildlife census using high-resolution imagery is now well established for terrestrial mammals or birds that can be seen on images. Nevertheless, the ability of UASs to detect non-conspicuous species, such as small birds below the forest canopy, remains an open question. This issue can be solved with bioacoustics for acoustically active species such as bats and birds. In this context, UASs represent an interesting solution that could be deployed on a larger scale, at lower risk for the operator, and over hard-to-reach locations, such as forest canopies or complex topographies, when compared with traditional protocols (fixed location recorders placed or handled by human operators). In this context, this study proposes a methodological framework to assess the potential of UASs in bioacoustic surveys for birds and bats, using low-cost audible and ultrasound recorders mounted on a low-cost quadcopter UAS (DJI Phantom 3 Pro). The proposed methodological workflow can be straightforwardly replicated in other contexts to test the impact of other UAS bioacoustic recording platforms in relation to the targeted species and the specific UAS design. This protocol allows one to evaluate the sensitivity of UAS approaches through the estimate of the effective detection radius for the different species investigated at several flight heights. The results of this study suggest a strong potential for the bioacoustic monitoring of birds but are more contrasted for bat recordings, mainly due to quadcopter noise (i.e., electronic speed controller (ESC) noise) but also, in a certain manner, to the experimental design (use of a directional speaker with limited call intensity). Technical developments, such as the use of a winch to safely extent the distance between the UAS and the recorder during UAS sound recordings or the development of an innovative platform, such as a plane-blimp hybrid UAS, should make it possible to solve these issues. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Coral reef restoration is often presented as a marine conservation solution that provides 'win-win' outcomes. However, most studies on reef restoration have focused on the biological success, while little is known about whether social objectives are ever achieved. This study investigates a reef restoration initiative in the Spermonde archipelago, Indonesia, where food security was initially presented as an intended social outcome. We utilised an ethnographic mixed-methods approach to investigate: 1) perceived sociocultural benefits of coral restoration to the local community; 2) impacts of reef restoration on local food security; and 3) local sociocultural barriers and limitations of reef restoration as a mechanism for improving food security. We found fish contributed to food security primarily as an income source to purchase food. Local people mainly valued nearby reefs for storm protection. Furthermore, most fishers are organised through patron-client systems that target pelagic species; therefore they currently have minimal dependency on adjacent reefs. However, fishing restrictions linked to the restoration programme still negatively impacted both pelagic fishers and a small population of reef-based fishers-indirectly by damaging reciprocal fishing relations with neighbouring islands and directly by limiting access to local reefs. Complex social and trade networks associated with patron-client networks present potential barriers for transitioning to reef-based fisheries and eradicating the use of destructive fishing gear, therefore limiting access to potential food security benefits generated from reef restoration. These findings show that the relationship between coral restoration and food security is tenuous and cannot be assumed. These findings also demonstrate that social dynamics surrounding community-based conservation initiatives are complex and context-dependent, and such details must be considered when designing marine habitat restoration initiatives. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

abstract={Freshwater ecosystems show more biodiversity loss than terrestrial or marine systems. We present a systematic conservation planning analysis in the Arctic Ocean drainage basin in Ontario, Canada, to identify key watersheds for the conservation of 30 native freshwater fish, including four focal species: lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, brook trout, and walleye. We created species distribution models for 30 native fish species and accounted for anthropogenic impacts. We used the “prioritizr” package in R to select watersheds that maximize species targets, minimize impacts, and meet area-based targets based on the Convention on Biological Diversity commitment to protect 17% of terrestrial and freshwater areas by 2020 and the proposed target to protect 30% by 2030. We found that, on average, 17.4% and 29.8% of predicted species distributions were represented for each of the 30 species in the 17% and 30% area-based solutions, respectively. The outcomes were more efficient when we prioritized for individual species, particularly brook trout, where 24% and 36% of its predicted distribution was represented in the 17% and 30% solutions, respectively. Future conservation planning should consider climate change, culturally significant species and areas, and the importance of First Nations as guardians and stewards of the land in northern Ontario. © 2021 Southee et al.

abstract={There are more than half of the world's human population living in cities. The vast amount of predicted rapid urbanization in the coming years consuming habitats and reducing the possibilities for wildlife to thrive in cities, and is contributing to the loss of global biodiversity. Among them, birds are the most important part of urban ecosystem and a key target for urban biodiversity protection. Besides, it is also a research hotspot. The last 20 years of urban bird ecology research have experienced exponential growth and now enables literature analyses and reviews. Here, we try to roundup these present findings on urban bird communities research from all over the world, overviewing patterns and variation processes on urban bird community, especially the changes in composition and structure, spatial distribution, living habits and the way of breeding and nesting under this continuous and rapid urbanization. To further assess the importance of and contributions provided by urban green space and vegetation to the urban bird community, exploring its affecting mechanisms that support bird diversity in urban areas, we reviewed the published literature for such studies. The results showed that: 1) Provision of greenery can ameliorate the hostility of the urban environment for wildlife, as well as provide suitable living space and food resources for urban birds. Green spaces provide the most important habitats for urban birds. 2) Not all forms of greening benefit bird communities to the same extent. Compared to those areas that do not pay much attention to native plant protection, areas that retain natural or semi-natural cover and large trees can support richer bird species. 3) Structure and coverage of vegetation have significant impacts on bird communities. The increasing canopy coverage, complex vertical structures and many kinds of plant species can produce various types of plant spaces and heterogenetic habitats. The increased plant spaces and habitats can cause changes in bird community composition, a correspondingly increase in species richness and diversity. In conclusion, maintaining and strengthening the healthy and stable of vegetation communities in cities is an effective strategy to conserve urban biodiversity. Collectively, protecting existing and planting new greenery has great potential to restraint urban biodiversity loss. Based on these, we propose the future research development direction of the relationship between the urban environment and bird communities. Further, the application prospects of this research in bird diversity protection to provide a more resilient, stable, and sustainable urban system are also pointed out. © 2021 Science Press.

abstract={Taxonomy presents itself as the critical basis of any modern scientific decision-making approach in the living world, and therefore accurate classifications have to be sought. Due to ongoing species naming debates, here we would like to facilitate a discussion on the methods and validity used for taxonomic claims and their influence on conservation, ecology, and management for squirrels in the western world as a wider example. Following the established epigenetic approach, we examine the rodent genus Tamiasciurus. We include in our assessment all relevant species-interfering characteristics and present one new perspective, ecological niches. The ecological niche is essential for explaining the species’ behavior patterns and their discrepancies among the congeners, adding insights into phylogenesis. We add the usage of mapping software such as geographic information systems (ArcGIS, Open QGIS) for this genus, as well as best-available open access data and the statistical aid from R. Misclassifications in the taxonomy are known to lead to conservation failures on a continental and societal scale, in part caused by a lack of knowledge by the public and the miscommunication between scientists and the public. As one possible solution, here we suggest a reclassification for Mearns’s squirrel (Tamiasciurus mearnsi) and a description update for the entire Tamiasciurus genus to improve conservation success. Additional solutions are presented to simplify classification with reduced errors and confusion in the animal kingdom. A larger future effort of this style is sought to greatly decrease marginalization, to improve the current lack of research priority and “laissez-faire” attitudes on environmental issues for a better relationship between humans and the biotic world. In conclusion we present important topics and yet unaddressed problems, such as how the rodent’s marginalization influences the pandemic disease transmission to humans (e.g. Covid-19, rabies, and bubonic plague), appropriately assigned budgets for their conservation, and the data transparency in a continuously accelerating climate-changing world. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Land use change is the most widespread driver of biodiversity loss in densely populated tropical countries. Biodiversity loss, in turn, results in changes in functional guilds responsible for various forest ecosystem services. It is thus necessary to understand the extent and types of biodiversity loss and functional guild alteration caused by land use change in order to facilitate sustainable land use policies. Here we study the effects of land use change on forest bird species and guilds in a human-dominated landscape in the Western Himalaya, India. We carried out systematic breeding-season surveys in six land use types within moist temperate forest: natural (protected) oak forest, degraded (lightly used) oak forest, lopped (heavily used) oak forest, pine forest, cultivation and built-up sites, in two adjoining landscapes, over two consecutive years. Our study shows moderate to drastic species loss in all modified land use types in comparison to natural oak forest. Species composition in modified land use types diverged significantly from natural oak; this effect was highest in cultivation and built-up sites and least in degraded forests. Compositional change in modified land uses occurred due to partial replacement of forest specialists with commensals and open country species, whereas abundance of forest generalists was relatively constant across the gradient. We also find a steep decline in the abundance of functional guilds such as pollinators, and insectivorous pest controllers in all modified land uses in comparison to natural oak forest. Our results have important implications for conservation in biodiverse mountain landscapes with significant human imprint. In particular, (a) low faunal diversity in monocultures and urban sites (b) drastic (50% loss or more) loss of forest specialists, pollinators and insectivores in degraded forests, monocultures and urbanised sites; and (c) the potential for degraded forest as refugia for forest species, are findings that can be globally applied to land use and conservation planning in human-dominated landscapes. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Understanding the extinction risk of taxonomic groups increases our ability to prioritize efforts to address biodiversity loss. Over 400 species of herrings, shads, sardines, anchovies, menhadens, and relatives belong to the Order Clupeiformes and include many of the most important forage fishes. These small, schooling fishes are ecologically, economically, and culturally significant. However, despite their global contribution to fisheries and our increasing reliance on them for food and modern commodities, we lack critical information regarding basic biology and population trends for most species. We applied the IUCN Red List methodology, a comprehensive and systematic approach to assess extinction risk, to all clupeiform species. The best estimate suggests nearly 11% of species are of elevated conservation concern, although this could be as high as 36%. Two regions, the Caribbean and the Indo-Malay-Philippine Archipelago have high concentrations of threatened and Data Deficient species and are areas of conservation concern. Major threats include overexploitation, pollution, and habitat modification. Immediate conservation priorities include: 1) increasing research and mitigative action directed toward species assessed as threatened or Data Deficient; 2) improving fisheries management regulations for the understudied but heavily exploited species, and 3) promoting local, intensive habitat restoration to reduce pollution and remove dams. These extinction risk assessments and subsequent analyses should be used as an informative tool for fisheries and conservation managers and to monitor conservation progress. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Climate change has ubiquitous impacts on ecosystems and threatens biodiversity globally. One of the most recognized impacts are redistributions of species, a process which can be hindered by habitat degradation. Protected areas (PAs) have been shown to be beneficial for preserving and reallocating species occurrences under climate change. Yet, studies investigating effects of PA networks on species' range shifts under climate change remain scarce. In theory, a well-connected network of PAs should promote population persistence under climate change and habitat degradation. To study this, we evaluated the effects of PA coverage on avian communities in Finland between two study periods of 1980–1999 and 2000–2015. Climate-driven community impacts were investigated by using community temperature index (CTI). We used linear models to study the association of PA coverage and the CTI changes in southern, central and northern Finland. In northern and central Finland, higher PA coverage was associated with lower changes in CTI and 45% PA coverage in northern and 13% in central Finland corresponded with complete mitigation of CTI increase. These results indicate that higher PA coverage strongly increases community resilience to warming climate. However a similar association between PA coverage and changes in CTI was not apparent in southern Finland. The PA coverage in southern Finland was much lower than in the two other sections and thus, may be too sparse to favour community resilience against climate change. The results provide empirical evidence for the international need to rapidly expand PA networks and halt biodiversity loss. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Restoration of damaged ecosystems has become an important tool to slow down biodiversity loss and to maintain ecosystem services. Peatland bird populations have shown a substantial decline during the recent decades in Northern Europe as a consequence of peatland drainage. We studied whether restoration of peatlands drained for forestry affects bird communities. We conducted bird surveys at 11 peatlands in Western Finland, where each of the restored and their pristine counterparts were surveyed before restoration and yearly after restoration during 2010–2018. We used linear mixed effect models to analyze whether restoration affected the number of species and territories of peatland specialist and non-specialist species and permutational multivariate analysis of variance to analyze the change in community composition. Drained parts of the peatlands had higher number of territories of non-specialist species before restoration, and restoration seemed to decrease these numbers towards the level of pristine parts. By contrast, restoration did not affect the number of peatland specialists and their territories, which was lower in drained than in pristine parts of the peatlands. Bird communities in restored parts remained different from pristine parts in terms of community composition after restoration. Thus, despite the effect of restoration on non-specialists, a substantially long time may be required for a recovery of the peatland bird communities. Based on our results, it seems that long-term monitoring of the restored and pristine peatlands is needed to determine whether restoration is effective in recovering the peatland specialist bird species and bird communities in general. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration},

abstract={Humanity is facing a biodiversity crisis, with freshwater-associated biodiversity in a particularly dire state. Novel ecosystems created through human use of mineral resources, such as gravel pit lakes, can provide substitute habitats for the conservation of freshwater and riparian biodiversity. Many of these artificial ecosystems are subject to a high intensity of recreational use, however, which may limit their biodiversity potential. The species richness of several taxa (plants, amphibians, dragonflies, damselflies, waterfowl, and songbirds) was assessed and a range of taxonomic biodiversity metrics were compared between gravel pit lakes managed for recreational fisheries (n = 16) and unmanaged reference lakes (n = 10), controlling for non-fishing-related environmental variation. The average species richness of all the taxa examined was similar among lakes in both lake types and no substantial differences in species composition were found when examining the pooled species inventory. Similarly, there were no differences between lake types in the presence of rare species and in the Simpson diversity index across all of the taxa assessed. Variation in species richness among lakes was correlated with woody habitat, lake morphology (surface area and steepness), and land use, but was not correlated with the presence of recreational fisheries. Thus, non-fishing-related environmental variables had stronger effects on local species presence than recreational fisheries management or the presence of recreational anglers. Collectively, no evidence was found that anglers and recreational fisheries management constrain the development of aquatic and riparian biodiversity in gravel pit lakes in the study region; however, the conservation of species diversity in gravel pit lakes could benefit from an increasing reliance on habitat enhancement activities. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Invasive rodent eradications are frequently undertaken to curb island biodiversity loss. However, the breadth of rodents’ ecological impact, even after eradication, is not always fully recognized. For example, the most widespread invasive rodent, the black rat (Rattus rattus), while omnivorous, eats predominantly seeds and fruit. Yet, the effects of seed predation release after eradication on plant communities and ecological functions are not well understood, posing a gap for island restoration. We examined the role of seed predation release following black rat eradication in changes to tree composition and aboveground biomass across an islet network (Palmyra Atoll) in the Central Pacific. We conducted repeated surveys of seed, juvenile, and adult tree biomass and survival in permanent vegetation plots before and after the eradication of rats. We observed a 95% reduction in seed predation for an introduced, previously cultivated tree population (Cocos nucifera). Juvenile tree biomass of all species increased 14-fold, with C. nucifera increasing the most, suggesting that eradication increased this tree's competitive advantage. Indeed, based on stage-structured demographic models, rat eradication led to a 10% increase in C. nucifera population growth rate. The effect of invasive rodent seed predation varies considerably among the plant species in a community and can shift competitive dynamics, sometimes in favor of invasive plants. These bottom-up effects should be considered in evaluating the costs and benefits of eradication. Documenting the variation in invasive rodent diet items, along with long-term surveys, can help prioritize island eradications where restoration is most likely to be successful. © 2020 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation},

abstract={Habitat fragmentation is a major cause of biodiversity loss, responsible for an alteration of intraspecific patterns of neutral genetic diversity and structure. Although neutral genetic variation can be informative for demographic inferences, it may be a poor predictor of adaptive genetic diversity and thus of the consequences of habitat fragmentation on selective evolutionary processes. In this context, we contrasted patterns of genetic diversity and structure of neutral loci (microsatellites) and immune genes (i.e., toll-like receptors) in an understorey bird species, the wedge-billed woodcreeper Glyphorynchus spirurus. The objectives were (1) to investigate forest fragmentation effects on population genetic diversity, (2) to disentangle the relative role of demography (genetic drift and migration) and selection, and (3) to assess whether immunogenetic patterns could be associated with variation of ectoparasite (i.e., ticks) pressures. Our results revealed an erosion of neutral genetic diversity and a substantial genetic differentiation among fragmented populations, resulting from a decrease in landscape connectivity and leading to the divergence of distinct genetic pools at a small spatial scale. Patterns of genetic diversity observed for TLR4 and TLR5 were concordant with neutral genetic patterns, whereas those observed for TLR3 and TLR21 were discordant. This result underlines that the dominant evolutionary force shaping immunogenetic diversity (genetic drift vs. selection) may be different depending on loci considered. Finally, tick prevalence was higher in fragmented environments. We discussed the hypothesis that pathogen selective pressures may contribute to maintain adaptive genetic diversity despite the negative demographic effect of habitat fragmentation on neutral genetic diversity. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.},

abstract={Land-use change is the most important driver of biodiversity loss worldwide and particularly so in the tropics, where natural habitats are transformed into large-scale monocultures or heterogeneous landscape mosaics of largely unknown conservation value. Using birds as an indicator taxon, we evaluated the conservation value of a landscape mosaic in northeastern Madagascar, a biodiversity hotspot and the center of global vanilla production. We assessed bird species richness and composition by conducting point counts across seven prevalent land-use types (forest- and fallow-derived vanilla agroforests, woody and herbaceous fallow that are part of a shifting cultivation system, rice paddy, forest fragment and contiguous old-growth forest). We find that old-growth forest had the highest species richness, driven by a high share of endemics. Species richness and community composition in forest-derived vanilla agroforest were similar to forest fragment, whereas fallow-derived vanilla agroforest was most comparable to woody fallow. The open land-use types herbaceous fallow and rice paddy had fewest species. Across forest fragments, vanilla agroforests, and woody fallows, endemic bird species richness was positively correlated to landscape-scale forest cover. We conclude that both fallow- and forest-derived vanilla agroforests play an important but contrasting role for bird conservation: Fallow-derived agroforests are less valuable but take fallow land out of the shifting cultivation cycle, possibly preventing further degradation. Conversely, forest-derived agroforests contribute to forest degradation but may avoid total loss of tree cover from forest fragments. Considering the land-use history of agroforests may thus be a promising avenue for future research beyond the case of vanilla.

abstract={Anthropogenic salinisation is becoming an increasing global issue for freshwater ecosystems, leading to serious biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. While the effect of anthropogenic salinisation on freshwater ecosystems has been intensively studied in recent years, most studies focus on salinisation effects on the individual or single groups of organisms without considering the effect on the ecosystem levels, such as diversity and trophic links. Therefore, we conducted a long-term field survey from May 2009 to August 2016 at 405 sites in northeast China to investigate the effect of a gradient of salinisation on community diversity, functional diversity and trophic links in mountain streams. Samples of water chemistry, periphyton, macroinvertebrates and fish were collected. Our results showed that as anthropogenic salinisation increased, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3− and SO42− exhibited significant increases (p &lt; 0.05). These increased ions caused decreases in taxonomic evenness and biotic integrity, but an increase in the beta diversity for periphyton and macroinvertebrates, and a slight increase in the evenness of fish. The increased salinisation resulted in the extirpation of salt-sensitive taxa and declines in macroinvertebrate functional richness and functional redundancy, which consequently led to simplified trophic links. Our results implied that if salt-tolerant taxa in high salinisation sites were not functionally redundant with less tolerant taxa, alterations of their functional composition probably decrease the stability of ecosystem functions. Overall, our study suggests that the ongoing anthropogenic salinisation is posing serious threats to biodiversity and trophic links in river ecosystems, and should be considered in future river restoration and biodiversity conservation. © 2020},

abstract={Freshwater ecosystems provide irreplaceable services for both nature and society. The quality and quantity of freshwater affect biogeochemical processes and ecological dynamics that determine biodiversity, ecosystem productivity, and human health and welfare at local, regional and global scales. Freshwater ecosystems and their associated riparian habitats are amongst the most biologically diverse on Earth, and have inestimable economic, health, cultural, scientific and educational values. Yet human impacts to lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands and groundwater are dramatically reducing biodiversity and robbing critical natural resources and services from current and future generations. Freshwater biodiversity is declining rapidly on every continent and in every major river basin on Earth, and this degradation is occurring more rapidly than in terrestrial ecosystems. Currently, about one third of all global freshwater discharges pass through human agricultural, industrial or urban infrastructure. About one fifth of the Earth’s arable land is now already equipped for irrigation, including all the most productive lands, and this proportion is projected to surpass one third by midcentury to feed the rapidly expanding populations of humans and commensal species, especially poultry and ruminant livestock. Less than one fifth of the world’s preindustrial freshwater wetlands remain, and this proportion is projected to decline to under one tenth by midcentury, with imminent threats from water transfer megaprojects in Brazil and India, and coastal wetland drainage megaprojects in China. The Living Planet Index for freshwater vertebrate populations has declined to just one third that of 1970, and is projected to sink below one fifth by midcentury. A linear model of global economic expansion yields the chilling prediction that human utilization of critical freshwater resources will approach one half of the Earth’s total capacity by midcentury. Although the magnitude and growth of the human freshwater footprint are greater than is generally understood by policy makers, the news media, or the general public, slowing and reversing dramatic losses of freshwater species and ecosystems is still possible. We recommend a set of urgent policy actions that promote clean water, conserve watershed services, and restore freshwater ecosystems and their vital services. Effective management of freshwater resources and ecosystems must be ranked amongst humanity’s highest priorities. © 2020, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Understanding why different life history strategies respond differently to changes in environmental variability is necessary to be able to predict eco-evolutionary population responses to change. Marine megafauna display unusual combinations of life history traits. For example, rays, sharks and turtles are all long-lived, characteristic of slow life histories. However, turtles also have very high reproduction rates and juvenile mortality, characteristic of fast life histories. Sharks and rays, in contrast, produce a few live-born young, which have low mortality rates, characteristic of slow life histories. This raises the question if marine megafaunal responses to environmental variability follow conventional life history patterns, including the pattern that fast life histories are more sensitive to environmental autocorrelation than slow life histories. To answer this question, we used a functional trait approach to quantify for different species of mobulid rays, cheloniid sea turtles and carcharhinid sharks – all inhabitants or visitors of (human-dominated) coastalscapes – how their life history, average size and log stochastic population growth rate, log(λs), respond to changes in environmental autocorrelation and in the frequency of favorable environmental conditions. The faster life histories were more sensitive to temporal frequency of favourable environmental conditions, but both faster and slower life histories were equally sensitive, although of opposite sign, to environmental autocorrelation. These patterns are atypical, likely following from the unusual life history traits that the megafauna display, as responses were linked to variation in mortality, growth and reproduction rates. Our findings signify the importance of understanding how life history traits and population responses to environmental change are linked. Such understanding is a basis for accurate predictions of marine megafauna population responses to environmental perturbations like (over)fishing, and to shifts in the autocorrelation of environmental variables, ultimately contributing toward bending the curve on marine biodiversity loss. © Copyright © 2020 Smallegange, Flotats Avilés and Eustache.},

abstract={Global food demand is rising, and serious questions remain about whether supply can increase sustainably1. Land-based expansion is possible but may exacerbate climate change and biodiversity loss, and compromise the delivery of other ecosystem services2–6. As food from the sea represents only 17% of the current production of edible meat, we ask how much food we can expect the ocean to sustainably produce by 2050. Here we examine the main food-producing sectors in the ocean—wild fisheries, finfish mariculture and bivalve mariculture—to estimate ‘sustainable supply curves’ that account for ecological, economic, regulatory and technological constraints. We overlay these supply curves with demand scenarios to estimate future seafood production. We find that under our estimated demand shifts and supply scenarios (which account for policy reform and technology improvements), edible food from the sea could increase by 21–44 million tonnes by 2050, a 36–74% increase compared to current yields. This represents 12–25% of the estimated increase in all meat needed to feed 9.8 billion people by 2050. Increases in all three sectors are likely, but are most pronounced for mariculture. Whether these production potentials are realized sustainably will depend on factors such as policy reforms, technological innovation and the extent of future shifts in demand. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={The exotic pet trade, both legal and illegal, ‬plays a crucial role in wildlife overharvesting and biodiversity loss world-wide, but drivers of demand for exotic pets are still poorly understood and under-studied. Some geographical areas, including the post-Soviet states, have little or no relevant research. We conducted open-ended in-depth interviews with 27 exotic pet owners in Russia. The research involved participants who collectively owned over 90 pet animals, including endangered and critically endangered species. The interviewees were classified into four main categories according to their motivations and reasons for keeping exotic pets. ‘Life-Savers’ were motivated by pity; ‘Accidental Owners’ acquired animals by chance; ‘New Experience Seekers’ were looking for something different and unusual; and ‘Collectors’ acquired animals based on their specific characteristics. Species and provenance preferences, level of husbandry knowledge, understanding of the legislation and rights varied among exotic pet owners often reflecting their different motivations. Despite their differences, together they formed a distinctive sub-community of pet owners. Our findings provide essential information for various stakeholders, including policymakers and law enforcement agencies, aiming to address exotic pet trade in Russia and its negative impact on biodiversity both in Russia and overseas. Understanding the motivations for exotic pet ownership will facilitate a more evidence-based policy to emerge to regulate pet ownership. This paper can also serve as a basis for further investigation into the exotic pet trade of Russia and our typology of motivations could be a basis for future studies in other geographical areas.

abstract={It is widely believed that people living in cities have fewer and poorer daily experiences of nature, and that this contributes to the biodiversity crisis on the basis that if people do not know nature, they will not care for its conservation. In 1978, Pyle coined the term ‘extinction of experience’ to reflect the loss of opportunities to experience nature as urbanization progresses. However, evidence of an emotional disconnect from nature arising from an extinction of experience remains poorly documented. Here we repeat a study conducted in 1996 comprising household surveys and bird surveys in a neighbourhood of Singapore, one of the world's most densely populated cities. We investigate empirically whether experiences of nature, opportunities to experience nature and the emotional connection between people and nature have changed across 22 years. We discover that emotional connection with nature has actually increased among greenspace users and non-users, while the frequency and duration of greenspace visits remained unchanged. Among greenspace users, the number of different nature elements experienced also remained unchanged and more frequent users demonstrated a stronger emotional connection with nature. We further found an increase in opportunities to experience local nature, as measured by bird species richness and abundance. While we found no evidence for an extinction of experience or an emotional disconnect from nature in this particular setting and timeframe in urban Singapore, similar studies elsewhere are necessary to explore whether there may be geographical, cultural or temporal variations.

abstract={The seasonal semideciduous forest (SSF) is the most threatened vegetation type of Paraná state. Protecting large extensions of pristine forest is essential to prevent biodiversity loss, but evaluating the potential of anthropogenic areas in maintaining biodiversity is important in highly fragmented landscapes. Here, we studied the avifauna of Paraná SSF in several habitats (RE, pristine forest considered as reference sites; LF, large forest fragments; MF, middle-sized forest fragments; SF, small forest fragments; UF, urban forest fragments; AF, agricultural fields; RA, reforestation areas) aiming to investigate which are the most vulnerable species in this vegetation type. In order to do so, we categorized each species according to habitat specialization, level of threat, and level of sensitivity to forest fragmentation. We also measured the similarity in bird species composition among six habitat categories with different types of anthropogenic disturbance (LF, MF, SF, UF, AF, and RA). We recorded 368 terrestrial bird species, of which 41 were considered to be vulnerable due to being forest specialist birds that were also sensitive and/or threatened. Sensitive and/or threatened species were rarely found in UF, AF, and RA (1–3 species). Therefore, large forests such as RE are of vital importance to bird species conservation. The similarity in bird species composition among LF, MF, and SF indicates that general ecological functions of birds could be similar in these habitats, suggesting that the conservation of forest fragments is important for the maintenance of bird community functionality in the present Paraná SSF. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.},

abstract={Biodiversity loss is on the list of the most challenging issues the world sustainability faces. This study aims to examine the global illegal ivory trades, identify key hub countries and map the key smuggling routes in the worldwide illegal ivory trading network. A social network analysis (SNA) and a set of network indicators are used to investigate CITES’s (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) ivory trading data from 1975 to 2017. Several important conclusions are derived: (1) The social network of global ivory trading is closely connected, with an average path length of 2.643 and an average clustering coefficient of 0.463. An average of 45,410.384 kg of ivory products was trafficked from each of the 182 countries to an average of another 8.17 countries. The dynamic networks of global ivory trading show the pattern of high connectivity and high aggregation. (2) The USA, the UK, Zimbabwe, South Africa, China, Japan, Sudan, Belgium and Hong Kong are the most important hubs in the worldwide ivory trade according to degrees and centralities in the SNA. (3) According to trading weight density, three significant ivory trafficking routes are illustrated: 1. African countries (Sudan, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, Somalia and Uganda) to Hong Kong; 2. Belgium to Hong Kong and Japan; 3. Mutual transactions between Japan and Hong Kong. The analytical framework in this study can also be useful for studying other illegal trading activities, like other animal trades, with respect to biodiversity conversation, and could serve as a reference for other network-based sustainability challenges, such as human migration, biological invasion, and waste smuggling and dumping. © 2021, EcoHealth Alliance.},

abstract={Forests are a critical component of biodiversity and are essential for a wide range of ecosystem services. There is a rapid and alarming decline of biodiversity worldwide. Indonesian biodiversity, in particular, is increasingly under serious threat of environmental degradation as a result of the prevalence of criminal activities such as deforestation, poaching, illegal wildlife trade, and forest fires. The occurrence of deforestation in Indonesia can be primarily attributed to two main factors: forest conversion into oil palm plantation and wood fiber plantation. This article examines the adequacy of the legal framework in Indonesia in addressing biodiversity loss, the challenges it experiences and any prospects for the implementation of biodiversity laws and policies. This examination will be undertaken through the theoretical frameworks of the ecosystem approach, and political ecology. It is concluded that the effectiveness of legislation related to biodiversity conservation is hindered by top-down approaches and the political and economic structural legacies of previous governments which tend to favour economic development at the expense of adequate biodiversity protection. To address the complex problems of biodiversity protection, Indonesia not only needs stronger legislation in protecting biodiversity, but must address other factors that hinder the effectiveness of efforts to protect biodiversity. In addition, despite the current prospect of initiatives and policy reforms aimed at reducing deforestation and forest degradation since the implementation of REDD+, each initiative has practical, financial and legal limits. Therefore, it is suggested that the effective coordination of each strategy is needed. Particularly at the local level, the capacity of the community to be engaged in conservation and the ability of the government to implement and effectively enforce biodiversity laws has proven challenging and needs to be addressed. © 2020 The Author.},

abstract={The Covid-19 outbreak has brought about fresh and intensified scrutiny of the wildlife trade, which substantively involves commerce in exotic pets. In response, major policy decisions involving trade bans have ensued, with calls for similar such action to be applied across the trade chain. Yet, these measures have been criticised, largely based on concerns that they risk exacerbating poverty, undermining human rights, damaging conservation incentives, and otherwise harming sustainable development and conservation efforts. Instead, many critics propose improved regulation of the status quo, with the intention of nurturing a legal, sustainable, safe, humane, and equitable wildlife trade. Herein, we provide a countering view that outlines how the risks presented by the wildlife trade are becoming increasingly recognised as being both manifold and severe; and raise concerns that the goal of a well-regulated wildlife trade is becoming increasingly exposed as a mirage. We conclude that while pursuing the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (with their focus on poverty alleviation, food security, public health, and conservation) is enduringly vital, a flourishing wildlife trade is not. Given that the exploitation of wildlife, including for the pet trade, has been identified as one of the dominant drivers of biodiversity loss, emergence of zoonotic infectious disease, animal suffering, and financial instability, perpetuating the concept of utilising a regulated wildlife trade as the default approach to protect people and planet is in urgent need of re-evaluation. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={The conversion of forests from complex natural ecosystems to simplified commercial woodlands is one of the major causes of biodiversity loss. To maintain biodiversity, we need to understand how current management practices influence forest ecosystems. We studied the effects of forest successional stage and management intensity on the abundance, species richness, and assemblage composition of small mammals. Our results show that management intensity significantly contributes to reducing the number of species after clearcutting. We revealed that intensively managed clearings can make the dispersal or foraging activity of small mammals difficult and hence negatively influence their abundance and species richness. The significantly higher species richness of small mammal species was recorded within more extensively rather than intensively managed clearings. In contrast, we did not observe significant changes in species richness and abundance after intensive management in old-growth forests. Species Clethrionomys glareolus and Apodemus flavicollis reached the greatest abundance in old-growth forest patches. On the other hand, Microtus arvalis and Microtus subterraneus were species mainly associated with the successionally youngest forest stands. Our analysis suggests that intensive management interventions (i.e., vegetation destruction by pesticides and wood debris removal by soil milling) in clearings produce unhostile environments for majority of the small mammal species. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={To mitigate the ongoing biodiversity crisis in Tropical Asia, caused by extensive deforestation and wildlife poaching, we will need to take more strategic approaches towards identifying and prioritizing meaningful conservation interventions. This, however, can prove difficult for data-limited species. Focusing on the little-studied mainland clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), a potential umbrella species in the region, we demonstrate an accessible, flexible, and scalable approach applicable to any species. First, we model the species’ range-wide local extirpation threat using a Bayesian Belief Network, taking into account the distribution of remaining suitable habitat and major anthropogenic threats (habitat loss and poaching). We then identify remaining habitat strongholds (defined as large contiguous areas of high quality habitat where the species could survive over the mid-to-long term) and grouped them into stronghold complexes, which we categorized based on local extirpation threat and recent camera-trap survey status. Our results show a 34% decline in the range-wide area categorized as a stronghold due to forest cover changes between 2000 and 2018, with 80% of remaining strongholds identified as having a high or very high average threat of local extirpation. Based on published records, only 60% of remaining strongholds had at least one site surveyed by camera-traps in the last 10 years, highlighting an important knowledge gap concerning the species’ current distribution and population status. Combined, the results of our survey review and threat analysis suggest the species is likely extirpated from all of Vietnam, most of China, and large parts of Cambodia and Laos. Finally, we synthesize our findings, highlight tangible conservation needs, and propose actions for each stronghold complex based on the area's specific threats, protection level, and survey status, paving the way for the detailed local investigations needed to implement meaningful interventions on the ground. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={The study of chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, started by Jane Goodall in 1960, provided pioneering accounts of chimpanzee behavior and ecology. With funding from multiple sources, including the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI) and grants from private foundations and federal programs, the project has continued for sixty years, providing a wealth of information about our evolutionary cousins. These chimpanzees face two main challenges to their survival: infectious disease — including simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz), which can cause Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in chimpanzees — and the deforestation of land outside the park. A health monitoring program has increased understanding of the pathogens affecting chimpanzees and has promoted measures to characterize and reduce disease risk. Deforestation reduces connections between Gombe and other chimpanzee populations, which can cause loss of genetic diversity. To promote habitat restoration, JGI facilitated participatory village land use planning, in which communities voluntarily allocated land to a network of Village Land Forest Reserves. Expected benefits to people include stabilizing watersheds, improving water supplies, and ensuring a supply of forest resources. Surveys and genetic analyses confirm that chimpanzees persist on village lands and remain connected to the Gombe population. Many challenges remain, but the regeneration of natural forest on previously degraded lands provides hope that conservation solutions can be found that benefit both people and wildlife. Conservation work in the Greater Gombe Ecosystem has helped promote broader efforts to plan and work for conservation elsewhere in Tanzania and across Africa. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

funding_text 2={Many challenges remain. The lack of diagnostic tools available on site, the limited infrastructure for keeping samples cold in transit, and the long delay between sample collection and testing, are the most formidable barriers. However, a newly constructed on-site laboratory funded by the National Science Foundation has improved our diagnostic capacity. Efforts are underway to build a mobile genome sequencing lab and develop local capacity in partnership with Microsoft's Project Premonition. The IUCN Best Practices Guidelines for Great Ape Health ( Gilardi et al. 2015 ) provide further guidance for protecting Gombe's wild primates from health-related threats. The COVID-19 pandemic has reemphasized these threats. Extreme precautions, including the temporary suspension of research, have been employed to safeguard the future of Gombe's wildlife ( Gillespie et al., 2020 ). Additional measures, such as providing treatment during outbreaks, may be needed. Outside the park, partnerships must be expanded to promote ecosystem health more broadly. Finally, to ensure the conservation of wildlife in developing countries, it is critically important to build local capacity for veterinary health. To date, the project has trained three Tanzanian veterinarians specialized in great ape health, and has provided advanced training in laboratory and research techniques to several other staff.},
funding_text 3={While TACARE succeeded in many respects, its efforts to promote reforestation could not keep pace with rapid human population growth. Analysis of aerial photographs and satellite images indicated that the deforestation rate in areas important for chimpanzees doubled from 87.5 ha/year (1972?1991) to 171 ha/year (1991?2003) (Anderson et al. 2004). Starting in 2005, JGI therefore adopted a new approach focused on implementing Tanzanian policies that empowered village governments to manage their land, with support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Village land use planning provided a mechanism to set aside land to restore ecosystem services while securing land tenure for local communities, clearly defining the boundaries of the park, village land, and village forest reserves. These plans were implemented with full involvement of government and community stakeholders (Pintea et al. 2016). JGI did not direct the land-use planning, but instead facilitated it by providing financial, logistic and technical support, including access to maps and geospatial tools to record and manage spatial data. The planning process followed six steps and required villagers to settle any existing land disagreements and agree on village boundaries and how their land should be used to meet specific human livelihood needs and conservation objectives. By 2009, 13 villages had completed their land-use plans, assigning 26% of their village area (96.9 km2) to Village Land Forest Reserves (VLFRs) (Pintea et al. 2012), which include an area now designated by the government as the North of Gombe Wildlife Corridor. Covering 2.7 times as much land as the park's 35.69 km2, the VLFRs represent a major step towards securing the future for Gombe's chimpanzees.We thank Richard Primack and Reinmar Seidler for the invitation to contribute to this special issue.

abstract={A large proportion of the world's extinctions have occurred in Australia, and threatened species lists continue to grow, notwithstanding government and philanthropic efforts. Most losses have been on private land, so relying on national parks and reserves is not enough to reverse trends and meet Australia's responsibilities. This paper proposes a model that could increase abundance and distribution of Australia's biodiversity, while providing financial incentives to private landholders to do so. It addresses the question, can landholder management of wildlife, and a form of private ownership, remedy shortfalls in government funding for biodiversity conservation and the resulting consequences of vast biodiversity losses? Landholders currently invest in propagating introduced livestock species, but they are prevented by current regulations from investing in a similar manner in threatened Australian native species. Market-based incentives could increase the distribution and abundance of species on private land and help protect the habitat of other biodiversity. The enabling changes would be contentious to some people but are consistent with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Sustainable Use policy. Different versions of wildlife privatisation have been successfully applied internationally: there is urgency for Australia to draw on these experiences and develop its own model to encourage and support wildlife on private freehold land. The model proposed in this paper focuses on: identifying locally overabundant populations or captive-bred populations as sources of supply finding landholders and philanthropists who would like to have custodianship of species; enabling entrepreneurs to respond to demand and bringing the two together where there is scope for a market-based sharing economy. Encouraging wildlife custodianship on private freehold land would be mutually beneficial, as it would not only result in an increase in biodiversity, but the economic value of wildlife could provide an income to landholders as well as enhancing Australia's conservation system. © 2020 Journal Compilation},

abstract={Rates of biodiversity loss in Southeast Asia are among the highest in the world, and the Indo-Burma and South-Central China Biodiversity Hotspots rank among the world’s most threatened. Developing robust multi-species conservation models is critical for stemming biodiversity loss both here and globally. We used a large and geographically extensive remote-camera survey and multi-scale, multivariate optimization species distribution modelling to investigate the factors driving biodiversity across these two adjoining biodiversity hotspots. Four major findings emerged from the work. (i) We identified clear spatial patterns of species richness, with two main biodiverse centres in the Thai-Malay Peninsula and in the mountainous region of Southwest China. (ii) Carnivores in particular, and large ungulates to a lesser degree, were the strongest indicators of species richness. (iii) Climate had the largest effect on biodiversity, followed by protected status and human footprint. (iv) Gap analysis between the biodiversity model and the current system of protected areas revealed that the majority of areas supporting the highest predicted biodiversity are not protected. Our results highlighted several key locations that should be prioritized for expanding the protected area network to maximize conservation effectiveness. We demonstrated the importance of switching from single-species to multi-species approaches to highlight areas of high priority for biodiversity conservation. In addition, since these areas mostly occur over multiple countries, we also advocate for a paradigmatic focus on transboundary conservation planning. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Climate change and biodiversity loss underscore the need for conservation planning, even in remote areas. Species distribution models (SDMs) can help identify critical habitat for reserve design and selection, and have quickly advanced to the fore of ecological inquiry. Such models are typically dominated by abiotic factors, following the Eltonian Noise Hypothesis (ENH) that physical features set the limits of species distributions. Nevertheless, recent studies challenge this notion and highlight the importance of biotic interactions. Resolving this discrepancy could have significant implications for conservation and ecological understanding. To test these ideas, we built distribution models for two large herbivores, muskoxen (Ovibos muschatus) and Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi), systematically observed across a vast spatial extent – 65 islands spanning 800,000 km2 in the Canadian High Arctic. To test the ENH we fit SDMs with two sets of predictors: (1) abiotic only (i.e. topographic, climatic) and (2) abiotic + biotic (i.e. vegetation communities, distance-to-heterospecifics). We evaluated these models and spatially estimated habitat suitability for each species. We found both sets of models had good predictive ability, although biotic variables (i.e. proportion of grass-lichen-moss) improved model performance and substantially narrowed areas of high habitat suitability. Niche overlap between caribou and muskoxen was moderate and highly suitable areas were spatially disjunct between species and largely outside protected areas. These results fail to support the ENH. Our study implies that biotic features, although often overlooked, may be important to the performance of SDMs and vital in identifying priority areas for conservation. For these large herbivores, reflecting trophic interactions in SDMs was essential when estimating areas of conservation value. Our approach helps prepare the way for improved projections regarding the prospects for wildlife while laying the foundation for biologically relevant protected areas. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={Aim: Evaluating conservation effectiveness is essential to protect at-risk species and to maximize the limited resources available to land managers. Over 60% of North American grassland and aridlands have been lost since the 1800s. Birds in these habitats are among the most imperilled in North America, yet most remaining habitats are unprotected. Despite the need to measure impact, conservation efforts on private and working lands are rarely evaluated, due in part to limited availability of suitable methods. Location: Northern Great Plains of North America. Methods: We developed a novel metric to evaluate grassland and aridland bird community response to habitat management, the Bird-Friendliness Index (BFI), consisting of density estimates of grassland and aridland birds weighted by conservation need and a functional diversity metric to incorporate resiliency. We used the BFI to identify ecologically significant areas for grassland and aridland birds and compared them with other prioritizations. Then, we used the BFI to evaluate the effects of simulated habitat management on grassland and aridland bird communities. Results: The most resilient bird communities were found in the Prairie Potholes region of Alberta, Saskatchewan and North Dakota and the lowest BFI values in the southern and western regions of the Northern Great Plains. BFI values were significantly greater in areas included in one or more prioritization, and increased with the number of prioritizations an area was included within. BFI values increased in response to simulated bird-friendly habitat management. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that practices recommended for use in bird-friendly grassland habitat management plans will increase the abundance and resilience of the grassland and aridland bird community and that bird community responses to management will be detected using the BFI. The BFI is a tool by which conservationists and managers can carry out adaptive management and accountable conservation now and into the future. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Globally, freshwater fishes are declining at an alarming rate. Despite much evidence of catastrophic declines, few Australian species are listed as threatened under national legislation. We aim to help redress this by identifying the Australian freshwater fishes that are in the most immediate risk of extinction. For 22 freshwater fishes (identified as highly threatened by experts), we used structured expert elicitation to estimate the probability of extinction in the next ∼20 years, and to identify key threats and priority management needs. All but one of the 22 species are small (<150 mm total length), 12 have been formally described only in the last decade, with seven awaiting description. Over 90% of these species were assessed to have a >50% probability of extinction in the next ∼20 years. Collectively, the biggest factor contributing to the likelihood of extinction of the freshwater fishes considered is that they occur in small (distributions ≤44 km2), geographically isolated populations, and are threatened by a mix of processes (particularly alien fishes and climate change). Nineteen of these species are unlisted on national legislation, so legislative drivers for recovery actions are largely absent. Research has provided strong direction on how to manage ∼35% of known threats to the species considered, and, of these, ∼36% of threats have some management underway (although virtually none are at the stage where intervention is no longer required). Increased resourcing, management intervention and social attitudinal change is urgently needed to avert the impending extinction of Australia's most imperilled freshwater fishes. © 2020 CSIRO.},

abstract={Wildlife trade is a key driver of the biodiversity crisis. Unregulated, or under-regulated wildlife trade can lead to unsustainable exploitation of wild populations. International efforts to regulate wildlife mostly miss ‘lower-value’ species, such as those imported as pets, resulting in limited knowledge of trade in groups like reptiles. Here we generate a dataset on web-based private commercial trade of reptiles to highlight the scope of the global reptile trade. We find that over 35% of reptile species are traded online. Three quarters of this trade is in species that are not covered by international trade regulation. These species include numerous endangered or range-restricted species, especially hotspots within Asia. Approximately 90% of traded reptile species and half of traded individuals are captured from the wild. Exploitation can occur immediately after scientific description, leaving new endemic species especially vulnerable. Pronounced gaps in regulation imply trade is having unknown impacts on numerous threatened species. Gaps in monitoring demand a reconsideration of international reptile trade regulations. We suggest reversing the status-quo, requiring proof of sustainability before trade is permitted. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Land-use intensification leads to loss and degradation of habitats and is thus a major driver of biodiversity loss. Restoration strategies typically focus on promoting biodiversity but often neglect that land-use intensification could have changed the underlying mechanisms of community assembly. Since assembly mechanisms determine the diversity and composition of communities, we propose that evaluation of restoration strategies should consider effects of restoration on biodiversity and community assembly. Using a multi-taxon approach, we tested whether a strategy that promotes forest biodiversity by restoring deadwood habitats also affects assembly patterns. We assessed saproxylic (i.e. deadwood-dependent) beetles and fungi, as well as non-saproxylic plants and birds in 68 beech forest plots in southern Germany, 8 years after the commencement of a restoration project. To assess changes in community assembly, we analysed the patterns of functional–phylogenetic diversity, community-weighted mean (CWM) traits and their diversity. We hypothesized that restoration increases habitat amount and heterogeneity of deadwood and reduces canopy cover and thereby decreases the strength of environmental filters imposed by past silvicultural intensification, such as a low amount in deadwood. With the restoration of deadwood habitats, saproxylic beetle communities became less functionally–phylogenetically similar, whereas the assembly patterns of saproxylic fungi and non-saproxylic taxa remained unaffected by deadwood restoration. Among the traits analysed, deadwood diameter niche position of species was most strongly affected indicating that the enrichment of large deadwood objects led to lower functional–phylogenetical similarity of saproxylic beetles. Community assembly and traits of plants were mainly influenced by microclimate associated with changes in canopy cover. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that the positive effects of deadwood restoration on saproxylic beetle richness are associated with an increase in deadwood amount. This might be linked to an increase in deadwood heterogeneity, and therefore decreasing management-induced environmental filters. Deadwood enrichment can thus be considered an effective restoration strategy which reduces the negative effects of intense forest management on saproxylic taxa by not only promoting biodiversity but also by decreasing the environmental filters shaping saproxylic beetle communities, thus allowing the possibly for more interactions between species and a higher functional diversity. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation is often implicated as driving the current global extinction crisis, particularly in freshwater ecosystems. The genetic signal of recent population isolation can be confounded by the complex spatial arrangement of dendritic river systems. Consequently, many populations may presently be managed separately based on an incorrect assumption that they have evolved in isolation. Integrating landscape genomics data with models of connectivity that account for landscape structure, we show that the cumulative effects of multiple in-stream barriers have contributed to the recent decline of a freshwater fish from the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia. In addition, individual-based eco-evolutionary simulations further demonstrate that contemporary inferences about population isolation are consistent with the 160-year time frame since construction of in-stream barriers began in the region. Our findings suggest that the impact of very recent fragmentation may be often underestimated for freshwater biodiversity. We argue that proactive conservation measures to reconnect many riverine populations are urgently needed. © 2020 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={The Devonian Frasnian–Famennian (F–F) boundary marks one of the five main extinction intervals of the Phanerozoic Aeon. This time was characterized by two pulses of oceanic anoxia, named the Lower and Upper Kellwasser events, during which massive marine biodiversity losses occurred. This paper presents high-resolution magnetic susceptibility, X-ray fluorescence elemental geochemistry and carbon isotope datasets obtained from the Steinbruch Schmidt F–F boundary section (Germany). These records lead to an astronomical time calibration of the environmental changes associated with the two ocean anoxia pulses. Cyclostratigraphic interpretation indicates deposition of the black argillaceous Lower and Upper Kellwasser horizons over ~ 90 and ~ 110 kyr, respectively; approximately equivalent to the duration of one short eccentricity cycle. This study confirms that the succession of events within the Upper Kellwasser event is paced by obliquity, under a low-eccentricity orbit. Hence, astronomical insolation forcing likely contributed to the expansion of ocean anoxia and other environmental perturbations associated with these two crises. The new floating chronology established for the Steinbruch Schmidt section is anchored in numerical time by means of a radio-isotopic date, obtained from a bentonite layer interbedded between the two Kellwasser horizons. After anchoring, this time scale gives a high-precision age of 371.870 ± 0.108 Ma for the F–F boundary. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Ecological networks can provide insight into how biodiversity loss and changes in species interactions impact the delivery of ecosystem services. In agroecosystems that vary in management practices, quantifying changes in ecological network structure across gradients of local and landscape composition can inform both the ecology and function of productive agroecosystems. In this study, we examined natural-enemy–herbivore co-occurrence networks associated with Brassica oleracea (cole crops), a common crop in urban agricultural systems. Specifically, we investigated how local management characteristics of urban community gardens and the landscape composition around them affect (1) the abundance of B. oleracea herbivores and their natural enemies, (2) the natural-enemy : herbivore ratio, and (3) natural-enemy–herbivore co-occurrence network metrics. We sampled herbivores and natural enemies in B. oleracea plants in 24 vegetable gardens in the California, USA central coast region. We also collected information on garden characteristics and land-use cover of the surrounding landscape (2 km radius). We found that increased floral richness and B. oleracea abundance were associated with increased parasitoid abundance, non-aphid herbivore abundance, and increased network vulnerability; increased vegetation complexity suppressed parasitoid abundance, but still boosted network vulnerability. High agricultural land-use cover in the landscape surrounding urban gardens was associated with lower predator, parasitoid, and non-aphid herbivore abundance, lower natural-enemy : herbivore ratios, lower interaction richness, and higher trophic complementarity. While we did not directly measure pest control, higher interaction richness, higher vulnerability, and lower trophic complementarity are associated with higher pest control services in other agroecosystems. Thus, if gardens function similarly to other agroecosystems, our results indicate that increasing vegetation complexity, including trees, shrubs, and plant richness, especially within gardens located in intensively farmed landscapes, could potentially enhance the biodiversity and abundance of natural enemies, supporting ecological networks associated with higher pest control services. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract={In light of the current biodiversity crisis, investigating the human impact on non-human primate gut biology is important to understanding the ecological significance of gut community dynamics across changing habitats and its role in conservation. Using traditional coproscopic parasitological techniques, we compared the gastrointestinal protozoan and metazoan symbiont richness of two primates: the Udzungwa red colobus (Procolobus gordonorum) and the yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus). These species live sympatrically in both protected and unprotected forests within the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania with distinct ecological adaptations and diets. Our results showed that terrestrial and omnivorous yellow baboons had 2 (95% CI 1.47–2.73) and 3.78 (2.62–5.46) times higher gut symbiont richness (both including and excluding rare protozoans) compared to the arboreal and leaf-eating Udzungwa red colobus in unprotected and protected forest, respectively. We also found a consistent depletion of symbiont richness in red colobus living in the unprotected forest fragment compared to the continuous protected forests [the latter having 1.97 times (95% CI 1.33–2.92) higher richness], but not in yellow baboons. Richness reduction was particularly evident in the Udzungwa red colobus monkeys, confirming the pattern we reported previously for gut bacterial communities. This study demonstrates the impact of human activities even on the microbiodiversity of the intestinal tract of this species. Against the background of rapid global change and habitat degradation, and given the health benefits of intact gut communities, the decrease in natural gut symbionts reported here is worrying. Further study of these communities should form an essential part of the conservation framework. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Protected areas (PAs) are essential to prevent further biodiversity loss yet their effectiveness varies largely with governance and external threats. Although methodological advances have permitted assessments of PA effectiveness in mitigating deforestation, we still lack similar studies for the impact of PAs on wildlife populations. Here we use an innovative combination of matching methods and hurdle-mixed models with a large-scale and long-term dataset for Finland’s large carnivore species. We show that the national PA network does not support higher densities than non-protected habitat for 3 of the 4 species investigated. For some species, PA effects interact with region or time, i.e., wolverine densities decreased inside PAs over the study period and lynx densities increased inside eastern PAs. We support the application of matching methods in combination of additional analytical frameworks for deeper understanding of conservation impacts on wildlife populations. These methodological advances are crucial for preparing ambitious PA targets post-2020. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Cane toads (Rhinella marina) were introduced worldwide and have become invasive in multiple locations, representing a major driver of biodiversity loss through competition (food, shelter, territory), predation, and the poisoning of native species. These toads have been used in Australia as a model for studies concerning invasion biology and ecoimmunology, as longer-established (core) and invasion front (edge) populations show altered stress and immune response profiles. Although cane toads were also introduced into the United States in the 1950s, these patterns have yet to be evaluated for the populations spanning Florida. Toads introduced into Florida have dispersed primarily northward along a latitudinal gradient, where they encounter cooler temperatures that may further impact stress and immune differences between core and edge populations. In this study, we sampled cane toads from nine different locations spanning their invasion in Florida. Cane toads from southern populations showed higher plasma bacterial killing ability and natural antibody titers than the toads from the northern populations, indicating they have a better immune surveillance system. Also, southern toads were more responsive to a novel stressor (1 hr restraint), showing a higher increase in corticosterone levels. These results indicate that possible trade-offs have occurred between immune and stress responses as these toads have become established in northern cooler areas in Florida. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={Climate and landscape change are drivers of species range shifts and biodiversity loss; understanding how they facilitate and sustain invasions has been empirically challenging. Winter severity is decreasing with climate change and is a predicted mechanism of contemporary and future range shifts. For example, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) expansion is a continental phenomenon across the Nearctic with ecological consequences for entire biotic communities. We capitalized on recent temporal variation in winter severity to examine spatial and temporal dynamics of invasive deer distribution in the Nearctic boreal forest. We hypothesized deer distribution would decrease in severe winters reflecting historical climate constraints, and remain more static in moderate winters reflecting recent climate. Further, we predicted that regardless of winter severity, deer distribution would persist and be best explained by early seral forage subsidies from extensive landscape change via resource extraction. We applied dynamic occupancy models in time, and species distribution models in space, to data from 62 camera traps sampled over 3 years in northeastern Alberta, Canada. Deer distribution shrank more markedly in severe winters but rebounded each spring regardless of winter severity. Deer distribution was best explained by anthropogenic landscape features assumed to provide early seral vegetation subsidy, accounting for natural landcover. We conclude that deer dynamics in the northern boreal forest are influenced both by landscape change across space and winter severity through time, the latter expected to further decrease with climate change. We contend that the combined influence of these two drivers is likely pervasive for many species, with changing resources offsetting or augmenting physiological limitations. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Illicit wildlife trafficking poses a threat to the conservation of species and ecosystems, and represents a fundamental source of biodiversity loss, alongside climate change and large-scale land degradation. Despite the seriousness of this issue, little is known about various socio-cultural demand sources underlying trafficking networks, for example the forthright consumption of endangered species on different cultural contexts. Our study illustrates how wildlife trafficking represents a wicked problem at the intersection of criminal enforcement, cultural heritage and environmental systems management. As with similar network-based crimes, institutions are frequently ineffective at curbing wildlife trafficking, partly due to the lack of information detailing activities within illicit trading networks. To address this shortcoming, we leverage official government records documenting the illegal trade of reptiles in Colombia. As such, our study contributes to the understanding of how and why wildlife trafficking persists across robust trafficking networks, which are conduits for a broader range of black-market goods. Leveraging geo-spatial data, we construct a multiplex representation of wildlife trafficking networks, which facilitates identifying network properties that are signatures of strategic trafficker behavior. In particular, our results indicate that traffickers’ actions are constrained by spatial and market customs, a result which is apparent only within an integrated multiplex representation. Characteristic levels of sub-network coupling further indicate that traffickers strategically leverage knowledge of the entire system. We argue that this multiplex representation is essential for prioritizing crime enforcement strategies aimed at disrupting robust trade networks, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and resources allocation of institutions charged with curbing illicit trafficking. We develop a generalizable model of multiplex criminal trade networks suitable for communicating with policy makers and practitioners, thereby facilitating rapid translation into public policy and environmental conservation efforts. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Recent studies on mass extinctions are often based on the global fossil record, but data from selected paleogeographic regions under a relatively constant paleoenvironmental setting can also provide important information. Eighty-nine marine vertebrate species, including cartilaginous and bony fish and marine reptiles, from northern Gulf of Mexico – located about 500 km from the Chicxulub crater – offer a unique opportunity to determine an extinction process during the last 20 million years of the Late Cretaceous. Our diversity data show two separate extinction events: (i) the ‘Middle Campanian Crisis’ (about 77 Mya) and (ii) the end-Maastrichtian (66 Mya) events. Whether this stepwise pattern of extinctions occurred locally or globally cannot be determined at present due to the lack of a dataset of the marine vertebrate record for reliable comparison. However, this stepwise pattern including the Middle Campanian and end-Maastrichtian events for, at least, a 13 million-year interval indicates long-term global marine environmental changes (e.g., regression, ocean water chemistry change). Because most Cretaceous marine vertebrates already disappeared in the Gulf of Mexico prior to the latest Maastrichtian, the Chicxulub Impact may not be considered as the most devastating extinction event for the community. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Biodiversity is essential for the maintenance of ecosystem health and delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, the drivers of biodiversity loss and the spatial variation in their impacts are poorly understood. Here, we explore the spatial-temporal distributions of threatened and declining ("biodiversity-loss") species and find that these species are affected by multiple stressors, with climate and human activities being the fundamental shaping forces. There has been large spatial variation in the distribution of threatened species over China's provinces, with the biodiversity of Gansu, Guangdong, Hainan, and Shaanxi provinces severely reduced. With increasing urbanization and industrialization, the expansion of construction and worsening pollution has led to habitat retreat or degradation, and high proportions of amphibians, mammals, and reptiles are threatened. Because distributions of species and stressors vary widely across different climate zones and geographical areas, specific policies and measures are needed for preventing biodiversity loss in different regions.

abstract={One of the main factors causing biodiversity loss in wetlands is drainage, nevertheless, even drained areas may provide habitat for aquatic fauna in the form of drainage ditches. Assemblages in ditches are regularly disturbed by ditch maintenance, but the extent of these disturbances and mitigation possibilities are poorly documented. We conducted an experimental study in three commercially managed forest plots in eastern Estonia, aiming to find out how ditch network maintenance (DNM) affects the diversity and assemblages of aquatic macroinvertebrates in ditches and remnant pools, and whether this effect can be alleviated by constructing mitigation waterbodies. For comparison we also collected data from natural pools in three undrained forest plots. Before DNM, ditches supported greater number of higher taxa compared to remnant and natural pools and more strictly aquatic taxa, whereas natural pools in undrained plots supported more Trichoptera shredders. After DNM, the diversity in remnant pools decreased. Moreover, majority of the pools dried out, which resulted in further reduction of the richness and abundance of macroinvertebrates. In ditches the diversity dropped immediately after DNM, but recovered in two to three years. Nevertheless, plot-scale richness and abundance did not completely recover. Assemblage shift in ditches took place right after DNM and remained distinct after the four year survey period. Mitigation pools provided habitat for several taxa (especially Odonata) uncommon in other waterbodies in drained and undrained plots. Our results show that DNM in forests substantially impoverishes habitat availability and reduces the abundance and diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates. We recommend retaining uncleaned sections in ditches and constructing mitigation pools as tools for supporting wetland biodiversity in drained forests. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Roads lead to biodiversity loss, primarily through wildlife collisions. This phenomenon is widespread, despite limited attention in Thailand. To reduce road mortality, the roadkilled species and their distributions along the road become a significant component for designing management strategies. We surveyed vertebrate mortality covering 44 kilometers of Highway 12, passing through Nam Nao Nation Park in Phetchabun Province of Thailand for 34 replicates between August 2018 and July 2019. We recorded 1,389 carcasses of 578 amphibians, 540 reptiles, 190 mammals and 81 birds. The rate of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) was 1.089 ± 0.823 carcasses-km-1day-1, comprised mostly of amphibians. The distribution pattern of WVCs was arranged in spatial clusters. Five wildlife collision hotspots for four taxa groups were identified. Overall, the WVC presence was positively associated with vegetation types but negatively associated with distance to the forest edge, the presence of r oad barriers and the number of road lane. Concurrently, the numbers of roadkill incidents were positively associated with amphibians more than other vertebrate groups, the night time and number of daily vehicles. Our results suggest that WVC rates on HW12 vary among taxonomic groups, temporal scales and environmental factors. It highlights key hotspots where mitigation strategies should be implemented for biodiversity conservation. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Tropical forest restoration initiatives are becoming more frequent worldwide in an effort to mitigate biodiversity loss and ecosystems degradation. However, there is little consensus on whether an active or a passive restoration strategy is more successful for recovering biodiversity because few studies make adequate comparisons. Furthermore, studies on animal responses to restoration are scarce compared to those on plants, and those that assess faunal recovery often focus on a single taxon, limiting the generalization of results. We assessed the success of active (native mixed-species plantations) and passive (natural regeneration) tropical cloud forest restoration strategies based on the responses of three animal taxa: amphibians, ants, and dung beetles. We compared community attributes of these three taxa in a 23-year-old active restoration forest, a 23-year-old passive restoration forest, a cattle pasture, and a mature forest, with emphasis on forest-specialist species. We also evaluated the relationship between faunal recovery and environmental variables. For all taxa, we found that recovery of species richness and composition were similar in active and passive restoration sites. However, recovery of forest specialists was enhanced through active restoration. For both forests under restoration, similarity in species composition of all faunal groups was 60–70% with respect to the reference ecosystem due to a replacement of generalist species by forest-specialist species. The recovery of faunal communities was mainly associated with canopy and leaf litter covers. We recommend implementing active restoration using mixed plantations of native tree species and, whenever possible, selecting sites close to mature forest to accelerate the recovery of tropical cloud forest biodiversity. As active restoration is more expensive than passive restoration, both strategies might be used in a complementary manner at the landscape level to compensate for high implementation costs. © 2020 Díaz-García et al.

abstract={Biodiversity loss is a central issue in conservation biology, with protected areas being the primary approach to stop biodiversity loss. However, education has been identified as an important factor in this regard. Based on a database of threatened species and socio-economic features for 138 countries, we tested whether more protected areas or more education investment is associated with a lower proportion of threatened species (for different groups of vertebrates and plants). For this, we fitted generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) to assess the relative importance of socio-economic variables on the proportion of threatened species. We found that education investment was negatively associated with the proportion of threatened species in 2007 and 2017, as well as with their change rates. Conversely, the percentage of protected land was significant for reptiles but showed weak relationships with other groups. Our results suggest that only increasing protected areas will not stop or reduce biodiversity loss, as the context and people’s attitudes towards wildlife also play major roles here. Therefore, investing in education, in addition to protected areas, would have the missing positive effect on achieving effective species conservation actions worldwide. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={The fragmentation of forests by agricultural expansion, urbanization, and road networks is an ongoing global biodiversity crisis. In Southeast Asia and other tropical regions, wildlife populations are being isolated into pockets of natural habitat surrounded by road networks and monoculture plantations. Mortality from wildlife–vehicle collisions (WVCs) is contributing to a decline in many species of conservation priority in human-modified landscapes. This study is the first in Malaysia to investigate factors affecting the occurrence of WVCs. We assessed roadkill data gathered by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks on small-, medium-, and large-sized mammals in Peninsular Malaysia. We examined the relationship between wildlife road accidents and several environmental factors. We found a total of 605 roadkill animals, involving 21 species, which included three species classified as Endangered. Road type (plantation road or highway), year, and distance of the road from continuous and fragmented forests were significant in determining mammal mortality. Unexpectedly, the majority of road mortality occurred on palm oil plantation roads compared to highways. Mortality of small- and medium-sized mammals was greater at locations further from continuous forest than those closer to fragmented forests. Segmentation of continuous forest by roads should be avoided wherever possible to reduce the threat of roads on crossing wildlife. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Assessing protected area (PA) effectiveness is key to ensure the objectives of habitat protection are being achieved. There is strong evidence that legal protection reduces loss of natural vegetation, but biodiversity loss can still happen without significant changes in vegetation cover. Here we use data from a specifically designed camera trap survey to conduct a counterfactual assessment of PA effectiveness at safeguarding local biodiversity in the Brazilian Cerrado. We surveyed the mammal community in 517 locations at the Sertão Veredas-Peruaçu mosaic, distributed across five strict PAs (264 survey sites in five arrays) and two multiple-use PAs with low management levels (253 survey sites in four arrays). We adopted a multi-species occupancy framework to analyse our dataset while also controlling for confounding factors not directly related to protection. Of the 21 species assessed, nine had higher occupancy in strict PAs, one had higher occupancy in multiple-use PAs, and ten did not respond to protection level. Site species richness was nearly twice as large in areas under stricter protection, with even greater differences for species richness of globally threatened and larger mammals (>15 kg). Overall we demonstrated that the strict PAs surveyed support higher mammal diversity than similar areas under less restrictive management, with a particular strong effect on larger and threatened species. Given that strict PAs cover only 3% of the Cerrado, our results suggest that expanding the area under strict protection is likely to benefit iconic species of the Brazilian savanna, such as the maned wolf and giant anteater. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The introduction of alien species represents the second most dramatic cause of biodiversity loss all over the world as they may negatively affect the genetic diversity of native species and represent a major problem to both conservation strategies, and functionality of the ecosystems. In the last centuries, sika deer (Cervus nippon) have been widely spread from their native areal (China, Japan, Viet Nam, Korea, Taiwan and Russia) across most continents and they are nowadays considered one of the most invasive existing mammal species. In this study, we jointly used two software tools (VOSviewer and CiteSpace) to quantitatively review and investigate the global scientific literature on the sika deer. We reviewed and analysed the patterns and trends in global scientific literature on the species, performing co-authorship and co-occurrence analyses and creating relative network maps. The results showed a high and constant productivity of Japan, followed by China and USA, with China having an increase in production over the last years. Keywords as “hybridization” and “introgression” figured among the most frequently investigated topics, suggesting genetics as an important field of research, followed by the impacts of the species on the vegetation. Out of the species native range, the most productive country was the UK, followed by Germany and Czech Republic, with similar preferences for the topic of “hybridization” and “introgression”. In addition, we investigated the presence of keywords that experienced an abrupt increase in number of citations (i.e. “citation burst”) across the sika deer scientific literature. The analysis confirmed the previously described trends, highlighting the importance of genetic studies applied to the native fauna. We concluded that the scientific production trends on sika deer follow different and defined research flows according to the area of investigation. In addition, it is possible to notice that countries with the biggest or most invasive populations are also the most prolific. Lastly, this study highlighted the usefulness of integrating different methodologies and approaches to investigate topics in scientific literature through the support of informatics tools. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aim: The establishment of protected areas is among the most widespread responses to mitigate species loss. Although protected areas are often assumed to have conservation benefits, negative impacts have also been documented. One potential negative outcome is leakage, whereby protected areas displace land-use activities harmful to conservation into adjacent areas. This can undermine protection by accelerating loss of species or skewing judgements of effectiveness. This study assessed the prevalence of deforestation leakage in a pan-tropical and subtropical selection of 120 protected areas. Location: Tropical and subtropical forest regions of America, Africa and Asia. Time period: 2001–2017. Major taxa studied: Threatened species of amphibians, birds and terrestrial mammals. Methods: We used Global Forest Change data to assess the average yearly rate of deforestation in protected areas, protected area buffer zones and statistically matched, unprotected control areas. We calculated and compared irreplaceability of habitat for threatened amphibian, bird and terrestrial mammal species between protected areas and buffer zones. Results: In 55 cases, deforestation rates were higher in buffer zones than in protected and control areas, suggesting a relatively high prevalence of deforestation leakage stemming from protected areas. In 78.2% of documented leakage cases, reduced deforestation in protected areas was not sufficient to offset the amount of deforestation in 10 km buffer zones to a level that would be expected without protection. In 90.9% of leakage cases, the irreplaceability of species in the 10 km buffer zone was greater than that of the protected area, implying a negative impact of leakage on threatened species. Main conclusions: The results suggest that protected areas are generally effective at preventing deforestation within their jurisdiction; however, leakage patterns can undermine conservation success because buffer zones often contain habitat for threatened species. We recommend accounting for the possibility of leakage when designing new protected areas and networks. © 2020 The Authors. Global Ecology and Biogeography published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Over recent decades, ungulate populations across Europe have undergone a rapid recovery. While this constitutes a conservation success, there is increasing concern about their impacts on shared resources with humans. Understanding ungulate food choices is crucial for predicting such impacts. Numerous studies have focused on single species or communities at narrow spatial scales. Here, we used 265 published diets from 87 European studies to investigate patterns of resource use by four common deer species (moose Alces alces, red deer Cervus elaphus, roe deer Capreolus capreolus and fallow deer Dama dama), and wild boar Sus scrofa at the continental scale. On average, deer diets separated mostly along a gradient from grass to browse. Fallow deer diets contained the most and moose diets the least amount of grass, but we also found large intraspecific variation among all deer species. Diets of roe deer, a presumed browser, frequently contained ≥ 25% grass. Wild boar diet contained grass in amounts similar to red deer but otherwise differed strongly from deer diets. All five ungulate species shifted to eating higher proportions of woody browse during winter. Habitat influenced variation in intraspecific diets, but the proportions of key forage types related to feeding type (i.e. grass for intermediate feeders red and fallow deer, and shrubs for the browsers moose and roe deer) remained fairly consisted across habitat types. In northern and central Europe, diet similarity between roe deer and red deer was highest during winter and spring and lowest during summer and autumn but remained constant across the seasons in southern Europe. We foresee that, as interspecific interactions driven by land-use and climatic changes increase across Europe, further monitoring and testing will be needed to understand the dynamics of dietary niche partitioning among ungulates. © 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

abstract={Tropical forest regions in equatorial Africa are threatened with degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss as a result of land-cover change. We investigated historical land-cover dynamics in unprotected forested areas of the Littoral Region in south-western Cameroon during 1975-2017, to detect changes that may influence this important biodiversity and wildlife area. Processed Landsat imagery was used to map and monitor changes in land use and land cover. From 1975 to 2017 the area of high-value forest landscapes decreased by c. 420,000 ha, and increasing forest fragmentation caused a decline of c. 12% in the largest patch index. Conversely, disturbed vegetation, cleared areas and urban areas all expanded in extent, by 32% (c. 400,000 ha), 5.6% (c. 26,800 ha) and 6.6% (c. 78,631 ha), respectively. The greatest increase was in the area converted to oil palm plantations (c. 26,893 ha), followed by logging and land clearing (c. 34,838 ha), all of which were the major factors driving deforestation in the study area. Our findings highlight the increasing threats facing the wider Littoral Region, which includes Mount Nlonako and Ebo Forest, both of which are critical areas for regional conservation and the latter a proposed National Park and the only sizable area of intact forest in the region. Intact forest in the Littoral Region, and in particular at Ebo, merits urgent protection. Copyright © Fauna & Flora International 2019.},

abstract={While urbanization is clearly contributing to biodiversity loss, certain wildlife assemblages can paradoxically be diverse and abundant in moderately developed areas. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that abundant anthropogenic resources for wildlife (i.e., food and shelter) outweigh the costs associated with urbanization. To test this hypothesis, we used camera traps to measure mammal species richness, diversity, and relative abundance (i.e., detection rate) in 58 residential yards in Raleigh, North Carolina, focusing on six types of features that might be used as resources: animal feeding, vegetable gardens, compost piles, chicken coops, brushpiles, and water sources. We also placed cameras at random control sites within each yard and sampled forests in nearby suburban and rural areas for comparison. We fit mixed-effects Poisson models to determine whether yard features, yard-scale characteristics, or landscape-scale landcover predicted mammal relative abundance for eight species. We also tested if the relative abundance of native canid predators in yards was related to the number of prey (rodents and lagomorphs). Species richness, diversity, and relative abundance of most mammal species was higher in yards and suburban forests than in rural forests. Within a yard, purposeful feeding had the strongest effect on animal relative abundance, with eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) being the most common (32.3 squirrels/day at feeders; 0.55 at control sites; 0.29 in suburban forests; and 0.10 in rural forests). We observed species using (e.g., eating) most yard features, although canids were less likely than other taxa to use resources in yards. The presence of a yard feature did not strongly affect the abundance of species at the control site in the yard, suggesting the influence of these features was highly localized. The relative abundance of predators had a positive association with prey relative abundance, and predators were less common in yards with fences. These results demonstrate that there is high use of anthropogenic resources, especially supplemental feeding by urban wildlife, and this increase in prey species may then attract predators, which supports the hypothesis that use of supplemental food resources explains the abundance of urban wildlife. © Copyright © 2020 Hansen, Parsons, Kays and Millspaugh.},

abstract={Space-use by aquatic ectotherms is closely linked to environmental factors such as temperature due to thermal-mediated metabolism and energy requirements. These factors are important, as they may alter an animal’s exposure to food/predators, hinder physiological function, increase competitive interactions, or even prompt population or biodiversity loss. Using general linear mixed-effects models, we investigated the influence of medium-term (months−years) environmental (diel period, water temperature, season, wind speed, air pressure, habitat type) and biological (turtle size) variation on space-use metrics for the Critically Endangered hawksbill sea turtle Eretmochelys imbricata, including dive duration, activity space, and rate of movement. We tracked 17 resident juveniles between August 2015 and May 2018 with a compact acoustic telemetry array (35−41 receivers in ~1 km2) in Brewers Bay, US Virgin Islands. Diel differences in space-use were significant and highlighted periods of relative inactivity (e.g. resting) during the night and activity (e.g. foraging) during the day. Water temperature was also an important covariate influencing behavior leading to shorter dive durations and higher rates of movement in warmer temperatures. High contribution of random effects (individual and year) to model variation was also apparent, suggesting that juvenile hawksbills can operate outside the relatively narrow environmental range experienced within the study area. Nevertheless, ongoing climate trends (e.g. warmer temperatures and more extreme weather events) pose a significant concern for hawksbill populations, as juveniles spend their developmental period in shallow nearshore areas where environmental impacts will likely be greatest. © Inter-Research 2020},

abstract={Biodiversity is declining and current strategies to halt biodiversity loss have not succeeded. In preparing the EU's Biodiversity Strategy 2030, it is essential to unravel different visions about conservation targets for agriculture, and to understand potential trade-offs with food production. In this research, we translated the narratives of experts into two conservation scenarios on a case study area resembling the Dutch dairy sector. The scenarios reflected a targeted versus a generic approach towards conservation. In the targeted conservation (TC) scenario, extensive grassland, reduced drainage and delayed mowing were applied in core areas to enhance meadow bird abundance, whereas in the generic conservation (GC) scenario, networks of nature and extensive agriculture were created and no feed was imported, which required a change in local agricultural land use. Subsequently, total feed and food (milk and meat) production and potential impacts on biodiversity were assessed, using the total energy and protein value for dairy, dairy productivity and the potentially disappeared fraction (PDF) of plant species richness. Land use changed on 6% of the case study area in the TC scenario, and 69 % in the GC scenario. Feed production per ha (net energy for lactation) was reduced by 3% for the TC and 41 % for the GC scenario. Food production on the case study area reduced to the same extent in TC, and to a larger extent (by about two thirds) in GC because no feed was imported. In consequence, biodiversity increased, thus reducing the PDF from 0.17 in the baseline scenario to 0.16 in the TC scenario and 0.10 in the GC scenario. In both scenarios, extensive grassland offset part of the loss in plant species richness caused by cropland and intensive grassland. Implementing these opposing scenarios requires different policy approaches or incentives for the dairy sector. Moreover, judging whether measures are worth the expected benefits for biodiversity depends on stakeholders’ values. Lastly, potential displacement of food production and associated impact on biodiversity needs to be considered. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Over five million hectares of tropical forest were cleared across mainland Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa for rubber plantations between 2003 and 2017 [1, 2]. Millions of hectares of further clearance are predicted as rubber demand rises, which will have major consequences for biodiversity [3]. A key question is how to reconcile rubber expansion with biodiversity conservation. We assessed the feasibility of simultaneously meeting global future demand for rubber with conservation of extinction-threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. We compared the spatial congruence of rubber bioclimatic suitability with extinction vulnerability [4] in Africa, Asia, and New Guinea, where large-scale rubber cultivation is viable, and simulated rubber expansion under different scenarios. We found no “win-win” areas with highest rubber suitability and lowest extinction vulnerability. Projected rubber demand could be met by allowing expansion primarily in New Guinea and African Guinea. However, New Guinea has high ecosystem intactness and both regions are rich in endemics. Scenarios suggest converting only areas suitable for cultivation would cause the largest biodiversity losses, including endangered species, whereas prioritizing conservation would result in only the conversion of highly unsuitable land. Compromise scenarios that balance production with conservation could cut biodiversity losses by two-thirds, protecting most endangered species while maintaining high rubber suitability. Development of high-yielding hardy clones expands the amount of win-win areas, as well as suitable areas with high extinction risk. These trade-offs reveal that clonal research and development, strategic corporate and government land-use policies, and rigorous impact assessments are needed to prevent severe biodiversity losses from rubber development. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.
Is it feasible to reconcile plantation expansion with biodiversity conservation? By mapping extinction threats, Wang et al. show that, despite finding no “win-win” areas to maximize profit and minimize threats, there were enough areas of compromise to meet 2027 rubber demand and significantly cut biodiversity loss compared with business as usual. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={There is increasing recognition of the occurrence of non-native species that are invasive and potentially contribute to biodiversity loss. A two-year camera trap survey was undertaken on Mountain Mosor, Croatia to determine the daily and seasonal activity patterns of recently introduced non-native aoudad (Ammotragus lervia). Aoudad were most active in open rocky habitats and least active in forest habitats. The effect of habitat on the recorded number of aoudad was significant, while the effects of month and the interaction month × habitat were not. The results showed a typical bimodal activity pattern of aoudad, with a modest peak in activity between 5:00 and 9:00 a.m., and a second, more pronounced activity peak between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. Since the native habitat of aoudad is similar to that in the Mediterranean region, the inferred range of daily and seasonal activities show that the species is well adapted to the new habitat. © BioOne 2020.

abstract={Urbanization impacts stream ecosystems globally through degraded water quality, altered hydrology, and landscape disturbances at the catchment and riparian scales, causing biodiversity losses and altered system functioning. Addressing the “urban stream syndrome” requires multiple mitigation tools, and rehabilitation of riparian vegetation may help improve stream ecological status and provide key ecosystem services. However, the extent to which forested riparian buffers can help support stream biodiversity in the face of numerous environmental contingencies remains uncertain. We assessed how a key indicator of stream ecological status, benthic diatoms, respond to riparian habitat conditions using 10 urban site pairs (each comprising of one unbuffered and one buffered reach), and additional urban downstream and forest reference upstream sites in the Oslo Fjord basin. Diatom communities were structured by multiple drivers including spatial location, land use, water quality, and instream habitat. Among these, riparian habitat condition independently explained 16% of variation in community composition among site pairs. Changes in community structure and indicator taxa, along with a reduction in pollution-tolerant diatoms, suggested tangible benefits of forested riparian buffers for stream biodiversity in urban environments. Managing urban impacts requires multiple solutions, with forested riparian zones providing a potential tool to help improve biodiversity and ecosystem services. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Infectious diseases are major drivers of biodiversity loss. The risk of fungal diseases to the survival of threatened animals in nature is determined by a complex interplay between host, pathogen and environment. We here predict the risk of invasion of populations of threatened Mediterranean salamanders of the genus Lyciasalamandra by the pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans by combining field sampling and lab trials. In 494 samples across all seven species of Lyciasalamandra, B. salamandrivorans was found to be absent. Single exposure to a low (1000) number of fungal zoospores resulted in fast buildup of lethal infections in three L. helverseni. Thermal preference of the salamanders was well within the thermal envelope of the pathogen and body temperatures never exceeded the fungus’ thermal critical maximum, limiting the salamanders’ defense opportunities. The relatively low thermal host preference largely invalidates macroclimatic based habitat suitability predictions and, combined with current pathogen absence and high host densities, suggests a high probability of local salamander population declines upon invasion by B. salamandrivorans. However, the unfavorable landscape that shaped intraspecific host genetic diversity, lack of known alternative hosts and rapid host mortality after infection present barriers to further, natural pathogen dispersal between populations and thus species extinction. The risk of anthropogenic spread stresses the importance of biosecurity in amphibian habitats. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Invasive alien species are recognized as the second leading cause of biodiversity loss and species extinction worldwide, with zoochoric dispersion being a key factor for the success of invasive organisms as they can favor the germination of these species. We performed a study in the southern Brazil involving three generalist species with abundant and wide amount of distribution in Latin America, with the objective of evaluating seed ingestion by positive criteria about its germination. We investigated the role of bird digestion on the germination of a native pioneer species, the Brazilian pepper—Schinus terebinthifolia, an invasive alien species in many parts of the world. We compared the germination of this native with those of the invasive Australian cheesewood (Pittosporum undulatum) concurrently. Interestingly, the effect of potentiating germination was more intense in the introduced species than for the native species. Pitangus sulphuratus is an important potential disperser for the germination of P. undulatum seeds, enabling the colonization of new areas in the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Understanding how biodiversity responds to intensifying agriculture is critical to mitigating the trade-offs between them. These trade-offs are particularly strong in tropical and subtropical deforestation frontiers, yet it remains unclear how changing landscape context in such frontiers alters agriculture–biodiversity trade–offs. We focus on the Argentinean Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot, to explore how landscape context shapes trade-off curves between agricultural intensity and avian biodiversity. We use a space-for-time approach and integrate a large field dataset of bird communities (197 species, 234 survey plots), three agricultural intensity metrics (meat yield, energy yield and profit) and a range of environmental covariates in a hierarchical Bayesian occupancy framework. Woodland extent in the landscape consistently determines how individual bird species, and the bird community as a whole, respond to agricultural intensity. Many species switch in their fundamental response, from decreasing occupancy with increased agricultural intensity when woodland extent in the landscape is low (loser species), to increasing occupancy with increased agricultural intensity when woodland extent is high (winner species). This suggests that landscape context strongly mediates who wins and loses along agricultural intensity gradients. Likewise, where landscapes change, such as in deforestation frontiers, the very nature of the agriculture–biodiversity trade–offs can change as landscapes transformation progresses. Synthesis and applications. Schemes to mitigate agriculture–biodiversity trade–offs, such as land sparing or sharing, must consider landscape context. Strategies that are identified based on a snapshot of data risk failure in dynamic landscapes, particularly where agricultural expansion continues to reduce natural habitats. Rather than a single, fixed strategy, adaptive management of agriculture–biodiversity trade–offs is needed in such situations. Here we provide a toolset for considering changing landscape contexts when exploring such trade-offs. This can help to better align agriculture and biodiversity in tropical and subtropical deforestation frontiers. © 2020 British Ecological Society},

abstract={Romerillo (Chiliotrichum diffusum) is an unpalatable and invasive shrub that reduces biodiversity and constraints livestock operations in the Magellan rangelands of southern Chile. Nutrient and energy inputs may enhance romerillo use by sheep, reducing its competitive capacity and restore biodiversity loss. In Exp. 1, 32 ewes were penned individually and randomly assigned to 4 groups (8 ewes/group), where they were supplemented with 1 (Group 1), 3 (Group 2), 5 (Group 3), or 7 g/Kg BW/d (Group 4) of canola meal, a high-crude protein (CP) supplement. Subsequently, all ewes had ad libitum amounts of freshly cut romerillo followed by 1% BW of grass hay. Intake of romerillo increased with the amount of canola meal offered up to 5 g/Kg BW (P < 0.0001), but ewes supplemented at 7 g/Kg BW ate amounts of romerillo comparable to ewes supplemented at 3 or 5 g/Kg BW (P > 0.05), reflected in a negative quadratic relationship between romerillo and canola meal intake (P < 0.001). In Exp. 2, 24 ewes were randomly assigned to three treatment groups (8 ewes/group), where they received a constant amount (2.5 g /Kg BW/day) of supplements with declining ratios of CP to metabolizable energy (ME): Canola meal (Group 1), a commercial pellet (Group 2), and a mix of corn:canola meal with a proportion (67:33) ewes typically select when consuming romerillo (Group 3). Romerillo and hay were fed as described for Exp 1. Ewes supplemented with canola meal ingested more romerillo than ewes supplemented with the mix (P < 0.05), and tended to consume more shrub than ewes supplemented with the commercial pellet (P = 0.06579). The relationship between romerillo intake and supplemental level of CP showed a positive linear effect (P < 0.05), whereas the relationship between shrub intake and supplemental level of metabolizable energy (ME) showed a quadratic effect (P < 0.001) with a minimum at the greatest values of ME intake. Collectively, these results suggest a negative effect of incremental levels of supplemental ME on romerillo intake, provided that the concentration of CP in the supplement declines. Thus, the level of supplementation and CP:ME ratio in the supplements both influenced romerillo intake by ewes, where the ratio observed in canola meal and the level of 5 g/kg BW/d represented the best options - out of those assayed - for maximizing romerillo intake. These quantities and ratios give insights into how nutrients interact with defended and unpalatable plants in the community during the foraging process, contributing to the optimization of targeted browsing programs, aimed at improving the efficiency of the vegetation management plan, as well as the nutrition and welfare of the herbivore. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={By the end of 2020, 75% of the Swiss population will live in cities. The urban densification will result in habitat and biodiversity loss. One solution to mitigate this loss in urban environments is the implementation of green roofs that are now recognised as a tool for the maintenance of epigeal and aerial arthropods. Green roofs can provide various services such as pollination and food supply for insects and various arthropods (e.g. arachnids) and animals (e.g. birds). The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of pollinating insects emerging from urban green roofs. Wild bees (Hymenoptera) and hoverflies (Diptera) were sampled using emergence traps on six extensive green roofs in the urban area of Geneva (Switzerland), from March to August 2017. Five species of wild bees and two species of hoverflies were identified: Lasioglossum morio (Halictidae) and Sphaerophoria scripta (Syrphidae) are the only two species considered as emerging from green roofs in our study. Ecological traits of these two species indicated generalists, well adapted to xero-thermophilic conditions. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Due to the concrete slope protection projects conducted around urban rivers in many megalopolises, increased attention has been paid to fish biodiversity losses accompanying urban development. Hatchery technology is a promising method for restoring fisheries where spawning substrates are degraded and/or lacking. In the current study, a Phragmites australis stereo artificial floating wetland (SAFW) was constructed in an urban river (Tuanwang River, Shanghai), and palm sheets were laid under the SAFW frame to imitate the spawning grounds for phytophilous fish. Fish species with five spawning types were distinguished from nineteen fish species in the study area. After viscid eggs were found to be attached to the palm sheets, the eggs were distinguished by the subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase I gene. All of the eggs belonged to six fish species: Culter ilishaeformis, Cyprinus carpio, Cyprinus auratus, Cultrichthys erythropterus, Rhodeus sinensis, and Hemiculter leucisculus. Cyprinus auratus and Cyprinus carpio accounted for the vast majority, and the number of these species was significantly greater than that of the other species. Dissolved oxygen and light intensity at the water surface were significantly higher than those at the deep water sites (p < 0.05), and all viscid eggs were inclined to be distributed at water depths of -0.5 and − 1.5 m. The results of redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that both water depth and dissolved oxygen were the main environmental variables in all spawning periods. The current study suggested that the relatively inexpensive P. australis SAFW was a useful hatchery technology for creating spawning grounds for phytophilous fish in urban rivers. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={With increasing loss and fragmentation of habitats driving the emerging global extinction crisis, paired with limited resources for conservation, there is an immense need to identify and prioritize the most important areas for conservation actions. The goal of this study was to measure, map and rank core areas and corridors for mainland clouded leopard (a forest indicator species) across its entire range in Southeast Asia. We used an empirically based landscape resistance model developed from range-wide camera survey data, cumulative resistant kernel analysis to define core areas and least-cost network analysis to identify corridors for long-distance dispersal. We then ranked core areas based on their strength and size, and corridors based on their strength and the strength of core areas they connect. We found that the most important core areas and corridors are concentrated in Southeast Asia, largely in Myanmar, Laos and Malaysia. Myanmar contains nearly the entirety of the first and third highest ranked core areas, as well as the most important network of corridors in SE Asia. Almost the entire territory of Laos constitutes one large potential core area, ranked as the second most important across the clouded leopard’s range. A large number (22) of very small (&lt;8000 km2) and fairly isolated core areas are in China. Only 24% of clouded leopard core areas and 17% of corridors are protected. This is the first example of using empirical models to prioritize conservation actions across the full range of a large carnivore. Our analysis identifies the location, size and connectivity of the most important remaining habitats of the clouded leopard across its range, which could provide quantitative guidance in the efforts to maximize the efficacy of regional conservation initiatives to conserve this species and the ecosystems it inhabits. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London},

abstract={The native Caspian Sea fauna underwent severe changes since the early 20th century, mostly due to anthropogenic activities. However, the nature, magnitude and rate of biodiversity change can only be assessed by comparison with natural baseline settings. A mostly in-situ mollusk fauna retrieved from Late Pleistocene (Hyrcanian, 107 ± 7 ka) deposits at Selitrennoye (Astrakhan province, Russia) provides a snapshot of a natural Caspian assemblage. In total, 24 gastropod and 13 bivalve species were identified. The fauna is predominantly endemic/native (94% in species numbers and 99% in abundance) and is dominated by three families (Cardiidae, Dreissenidae and Hydrobiidae). The Selitrennoye assemblage is a natural baseline of a pre-invasive Caspian Sea fauna living in a shallow (15–25 m), lower mesohaline (5–8 psu) open lake environment. The species-rich Selitrennoye fauna contrasts with the largely depleted and invasive-dominated fauna that currently occupies similar habitats in the Caspian Sea and underlines the magnitude of the current biodiversity crisis. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Hurricanes can cause extensive long-term damage to small-scale fisheries. Yet, information is scarce on how communities are locally impacted by extreme events in the Caribbean and in other parts of the world. Focusing on an artisanal fishery in Yaguajay, Sancti Spiritus, Cuba, this article explores how artisanal fishers have perceived and responded to the different damages brought about by Hurricane Irma in September 2017 and the inundations associated with Storm Alberto in May 2018. Combining discussions and short interviews carried out pre and post-storms Irma and Alberto, this study identifies major environmental impacts and matching responses. In addition, the article sheds light on the evolution of small-scale fishing communities in Cuba and their current organization. Results show local perceptions of extensive biodiversity loss in terms of mangrove coverage, changes in salinity, and the quality of coastal environments that have affected the composition of captures and fish sizes. As a consequence of these changes, fishers are adjusting their effort and fishing intensity to match perturbations. Findings underscore the need to identify the synergistic relations that may exist between prior environmental degradation and different extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes, and excessive precipitation. The interrelation of these factors may result in compounded aggravated impacts that may unfold over longer temporal scales and not just as a one-time event. Authors conclude by stressing the importance of including the systematic study of extreme events along with local perceptions of ecological change in fishery management plans. Because fishers´ responses to hazards are based on their experiences and knowledge of the state of coastal and marine habitats, and especially on expectations about what constitutes normal ranges of change, threats, and levels of risks, this information is key to guide behavioral interventions and decision frameworks that can foster the development of hurricane resistant communities. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Biodiversity loss is happening at an unprecedented rate. Understanding and protecting biodiversity has never been more urgent, and scientific research is key to this. Fair and transparent access and benefit sharing policies enable research to take place, whilst supporting sustainable livelihoods of communities and ensuring benefits are shared. Current national legislation has been unevenly implemented and, in this article, we recommend frameworks be developed to standardize the provision and use of genetic resources for non-commercial research. Summary: Access to genetic resources for scientific research is vital to support and promote the conservation and sustainable use of the world's biodiversity. The regulatory framework for research is stipulated by Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) legislation at a national level, but other elements – legal transparency, respect, cooperation, and trust – are essential for its effective and sustainable implementation. Despite the intention of this “ABS regime” to protect natural resources and associated knowledge from misappropriation, several studies have questioned whether national regulatory approaches have led to constraints on research and conservation. We analyse evidence and provide case studies on how these regulations are affecting research. We find that the number of Internationally Recognized Certificates of Compliance (IRCC) of the Nagoya Protocol (NP), the key compliance mechanism of the ABS system, doubled in the six months prior to February 2020 and analyse why this may be the case. Additionally, a survey of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Authorities in 28 countries, found differences in the way the Registered Scientific Institute scheme is interpreted and used to facilitate scientific research. Our results suggest while the regulatory systems are perceived as hindering research and conservation, regulatory mechanisms enabling responsible research are becoming increasingly functional. We argue that functional and transparent systems are needed for both regulators and researchers, to ensure that non-commercial research can continue smoothly, and present conclusions to support research for the benefit of all countries and partners involved, through appropriate frameworks for implementation and reporting. © 2020 The Authors, Plants, People, Planet © New Phytologist Foundation},

abstract={There is growing evidence that wildlife-based tourism can be a valuable pathway to transform the environmental knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of tourists, if complemented by effective conservation messaging and proactive interpretive experiences. Yet, such conservation messaging is not always a priority for many wildlife-based tourism operators, who often avoid exposing happy tourists to the daunting biodiversity crisis. In this paper, we argue that failing to encourage tourists to do more on behalf of wildlife represents a missed opportunity for conservation. Based on a comprehensive review of the academic literature, we show that conservation messaging is virtually absent from many mainstream wildlife-based tourism operations, often failing to connect global audiences to conservation issues. We found that the scholarly literature on the effectiveness of different techniques, approaches and contents of conservation messaging in wildlife-based tourism is meagre at best. Yet, alternative forms of communicating conservation-related messages are opening new avenues to broaden the conservation potential of wildlife-based tourism. We suggest a set of principles for improving the implementation of conservation messaging in wildlife-based tourism operations in order to maximize their educational potential. We end by calling for further research efforts on the factors implicated in effective conservation messaging in wildlife-based tours in order to pave the way for a new era of conservation-oriented tourism. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Forest degradation is considered to be one of the major threats to forests over the globe, which has considerably increased in recent decades. Forests are gradually getting fragmented and facing biodiversity losses because of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Future prediction of forest degradation spatiotemporal dynamics and fragmentation is imperative for generating a framework that can aid in prioritizing forest conservation and sustainable management practices. In this study, a random forest algorithm was developed and applied to a series of Landsat images of 1998, 2008, and 2018, to delineate spatiotemporal forest cover status in the sanctuary, along with the predictive model viz. the Cellular Automata Markov Chain for simulating a 2028 forest cover scenario in Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), Gujarat, India. The model's predicting ability was assessed using a series of accuracy indices. Moreover, spatial pattern analysis-with the use of FRAGSTATS 4.2 software-was applied to the generated and predicted forest cover classes, to determine forest fragmentation in SWS. Change detection analysis showed an overall decrease in dense forest and a subsequent increase in the open and degraded forests. Several fragmentation metrics were quantified at patch, class, and landscape level, which showed trends reflecting a decrease in fragmentation in forest areas of SWS for the period 1998 to 2028. The improvement in SWS can be attributed to the enhanced forest management activities led by the government, for the protection and conservation of the sanctuary. To our knowledge, the present study is one of the few focusing on exploring and demonstrating the added value of the synergistic use of the Cellular Automata Markov Chain Model Coupled with Fragmentation Statistics in forest degradation analysis and prediction. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Biodiversity has been devastated globally in the past hundred years, largely because of land conversion and agricultural intensification. Conversion of tropical forest to oil palm plantations is one of the greatest per unit area contributors to biodiversity loss in Southeast Asia. Concerned consumers, mainly from developed countries, have begun demanding sustainable palm oil in response to these issues. More 'biodiversity-friendly' oil palm production is also in demand, similar to that of other commodity crops (e.g. coffee, cacao). However, farming practices that improve biodiversity are thought to reduce yield, leading to increased pressure to clear more forest, resulting in further biodiversity loss. Here, we explore relationships between oil palm yield and avian biodiversity. To gather data on yields and agricultural inputs, we interviewed smallholders in Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia. We also quantified bird species richness, feeding guild diversity, abundance, and vegetation structure in smallholdings. We found that smallholdings with high yields were characterised by high species richness and feeding guild diversity, but low bird abundance. Our empirical results show the benefits to both yield and avian biodiversity of a wildlife-friendly strategy in smallholdings. We encourage the integration of farming practices with management that improves biodiversity to reconcile oil palm production and nature conservation. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={Amphibians are proportionately over-represented in the current wave of global biodiversity loss. Disease and habitat loss are implicated in many amphibian species declines, but amphibians are also predicted to be sensitive to changes in climate, particularly changes in temperature and loss of moisture. These changes could severely impact frog use of terrestrial habitats. We used data from a long-term (2007–18) landscape-scale experiment in south-eastern Australia to test the effects of terrestrial habitat characteristics and restoration treatments on frog species. We found declines in species richness and in the occurrences of two locally-common species (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis and Uperoleia laevigata). These declines were associated with high maximum temperatures, low minimum temperatures and low rainfall. Coarse woody debris addition was associated with higher species richness and L. tasmaniensis occurrence, but this effect was not greater in times of reduced rainfall and high maximum temperatures, implying a weak ‘refugia’ effect. Frogs were positively associated with wetter sites, and this association increased with higher maximum temperatures. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence that show that prolonged periods of drought pose a key threat to frog populations and that short periods of relief from drought conditions are insufficient to allow recovery of terrestrial frog populations over the long term. Restoration efforts could include the provision of coarse woody debris and should also ensure that good quality aquatic habitat, such as drought-resistant ponds and dams, are available throughout hot and dry times as a supplement to ephemeral aquatic habitat. © 2020},

abstract={In a recently published paper, Celestino et al. (2019) investigated the effects of a fish ladder located near the Porto Primavera Dam (Paraná River, Brazil) in order to evaluate if it provided free passage for the migratory fish Prochilodus lineatus. Fish were marked with PIT-tags and movements were monitored within the ladder over a 3.5-year period. The main finding was “Our study identified bidirectional movements by P. lineatus through the Porto Primavera fish ladder, including multiple passes by the same fish” (p. 241). It led authors to conclude: “Our results suggest that by providing bidirectional connectivity between upstream and downstream habitats, fishways can be an effective tool for preserving populations of P. lineatus and probably for other species of Prochilodus” (p. 242). Both conclusions, however, may not be correct, because they go beyond the data directly presented in the manuscript. The study overlooked issues related to the spatial scale and experimental design, since it was limited to investigate patterns of movement within the fish ladder alone. In this sense, they encourage the reader to accept patterns and conclusions that were not specifically investigated (e.g., migratory dynamics and conservation success), or that cannot be fully supported by the data (e.g., bidirectional movements and efficient passage). As the conclusions presented in the study have direct implications for the licensing process of hydropower dams and the management/conservation of Neotropical migratory fishes, we provide suggestions to highlight additional important factors and issues that should be considered or addressed in future research. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Remote sensing has become an integral and invaluable tool to inform biodiversity conservation and monitoring of habitat degradation and restoration over time. Despite the disproportionately high levels of biodiversity loss in freshwater ecosystems worldwide, ichthyofauna are commonly overlooked in favor of other keystone species. Freshwater fish, as indicators of overall aquatic ecosystem health, can also be indicators of larger scale problems within an ecosystem. As a case study with multi-temporal, multi-resolution satellite imagery, we examined deforestation and forest fragmentation around the Atewa Forest Reserve, Ghana. Within small creeks, Limbochromis robertsi, a unique freshwater cichlid with an extremely limited distribution range, can be found. Historically, the land cover in the area has undergone substantial deforestation for agriculture and artisanal small-scale mining. In the 1389-km2 study area, we found deforestation accelerated along with increased forest fragmentation in the 2014–2017 period (167.4 km2 of deforestation) with the majority of the forest loss along the river and creek banks due to small-scale mining operations and increased agriculture. Field visits indicated a decrease in the total L. robertsi population by approximately 90% from the early 1990s to 2018. Its distribution has been reduced to higher elevations by anthropogenic habitat barriers at low elevations and the presence of predatory species. Loss of riparian forest through land use and cover change to mining and agriculture contributes to the habitat degradation for this endemic species. Fine spatial- and temporal-scale studies are required to assess habitat characteristics are not captured by global- or continental-scale datasets. © 2020 Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation},

abstract={Alien species are a driver of biodiversity loss, with impacts of different aliens on native species varying considerably. Identifying the contributions of alien species to native species declines could help target management efforts. Globally, seabirds breeding on islands have proven to be highly susceptible to alien species. The breeding colonies of the pink-footed shearwater (Ardenna creatopus) are threatened by the negative impacts of alien mammals. We combined breeding monitoring data with a hierarchical model to separate the effects of different alien mammal assemblages on the burrow occupancy and hatching success of the pink-footed shearwater in the Juan Fernández Archipelago, Chile. We show that alien mammals affected the rates of burrow occupancy, but had little effect on hatching success. Rabbits produced the highest negative impacts on burrow occupancy, whereas the effects of other alien mammals were more uncertain. In addition, we found differences in burrow occupancy between islands regardless of their alien mammal assemblages. Managing rabbits will improve the reproductive performance of this shearwater, but research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which alien mammals affect the shearwaters and to explain why burrow occupancy varies between islands. © The Author(s), 2020.

abstract={Like all human action that changes ecosystems, roads contribute to habitat fragmentation, acting as barriers and, consequently, causing biodiversity loss. Given the need for studies related to roadkill of wild animals, especially in the Atlantic Forest, and the vulnerability of mammal species to roadkill on the roads, we analyzed roadkill data of medium and large mammals. The study was carried out in a 100 km stretch of the BR-262 road, Atlantic Forest biome, in the Espírito Santo state. We obtained roadkill mammals’ carcasses by 42 monitoring campaigns, between January 2017 and January 2018. We recorded 259 carcasses of 22 species, which resulted in a roadkill rate of 0.062 mammal/km/day. We found that roadkill rates are higher in rainy months and lower in dry ones. We found support that three variables best predicted roadkill occurrence in the BR-262 road (i.e. positive relationship with forest cover, and accumulated precipitation ‘rainfall’, and negative relationship with speed reducers). These results indicate an alarming impact on the mammalian fauna at the site and reinforce the need for management measures and actions to reduce the mortality of wild mammals on the roads. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Vector-borne diseases that occur in humans, as well as in domestic and wild reservoir hosts, cause a significant concern in public health, veterinary health, and ecological health in biodiverse environments. The majority of vector-borne zoonotic diseases are transmitted among diverse host species, but different hosts have their own ability to transmit pathogens and to attract vectors. These combined transmission mechanisms in hosts and vectors are often called "host competencies" and "vector-feeding preferences." The purpose of this research is to assess the relationship between the host's ability to transmit the pathogen to vectors and the different feeding preferences for a specific host using a multi-host mathematical model. Working with zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, numerical simulations illustrate these vector-host populations' behavior together for the first time. Global sensitivity analyses confirm that the basic reproductive number, R0, is more sensitive to the the vector-demographic and biting-rate parameters in both diseases. Therefore, in this era of remarkable biodiversity loss and increased vector-borne diseases, it is crucial to understand how vector-host interaction mechanisms affect disease dynamics in humans within wildlife and domestic settings. © 2020 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

abstract={Urgent action needs to be taken to halt global biodiversity crisis. To be effective in the implementation of such action, managers and policy-makers need updated information on the status and trends of biodiversity. Here, we test the ability of remotely sensed ecosystem functioning attributes (EFAs) to predict the distribution of 73 bird species with different life-history traits. We run ensemble species distribution models (SDMs) trained with bird atlas data and 12 EFAs describing different dimensions of carbon cycle and surface energy balance. Our ensemble SDMs-exclusively based on EFAs-hold a high predictive capacity across 71 target species (up to 0.94 and 0.79 of Area Under the ROC curve and true skill statistic (TSS)). Our results showed the life-history traits did not significantly affect SDM performance. Overall, minimum Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and maximum Albedo values (descriptors of primary productivity and energy balance) were the most important predictors across our bird community. Our approach leverages the existing atlas data and provides an alternative method to monitor inter-annual bird habitat dynamics from space in the absence of long-term biodiversity monitoring schemes. This study illustrates the great potential that satellite remote sensing can contribute to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and to the Essential Biodiversity Variables framework (EBV class "Species distribution"). © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Among the world's large Carnivores, American black bears (Ursus americanus) are the foremost conservation success story. Populations have been expanding across North America because the species is adaptable and tolerant of living near people, and because management agencies in the U.S. and Canada controlled hunting and other human-sources of mortality. As a result, human-black bear conflicts (damage to property, general nuisance, threat to human safety) have dramatically increased in some areas, making it urgently important to develop and deploy a variety of mitigation tools. Previous studies claimed that legal hunting did not directly reduce conflicts, but they did not evaluate whether hunting controlled conflicts via management of population size. Here, we compared temporal patterns of phonedin complaints about black bears (total ∼63,500) in Minnesota, USA, over 4 decades to corresponding bear population estimates: Both doubled during the first decade. We also quantified natural bear foods, and found that large year-to-year fluctuations affected numbers of complaints; however, since this variation is due largely to weather, this factor cannot be managed. Complaints fell sharply when the management agency (1) shifted more responsibility for preventing and mitigating conflicts to the public; and (2) increased hunting pressure to reduce the bear population. This population reduction was more extreme than intended, however, and after hunting pressure was curtailed, population regrowth was slower than anticipated; consequently both population size and complaints remained at relatively low levels statewide for 2 decades (although with local hotspots). These long-term data indicated that conflicts can be kept in tolerable bounds by managing population size through hunting; but due to the bluntness of this instrument and deficiencies and uncertainties in monitoring and manipulating populations, it is wiser to maintain a population at a level where conflicts are socially-acceptable than try to reduce it once it is well beyond that point. © 2020 Garshelis et al.

abstract={Most infectious diseases in humans originate from animals. In this paper, we explore the role of animal farming and meat consumption in the emergence and amplification of infectious diseases. First, we discuss how meat production increases epidemic risks, either directly through increased contact with wild and farmed animals or indirectly through its impact on the environment (e.g., biodiversity loss, water use, climate change). Traditional food systems such as bushmeat and backyard farming increase the risks of disease transmission from wild animals, while intensive farming amplifies the impact of the disease due to the high density, genetic proximity, increased immunodeficiency, and live transport of farmed animals. Second, we describe the various direct and indirect costs of animal-based infectious diseases, and in particular, how these diseases can negatively impact the economy and the environment. Last, we discuss policies to reduce the social costs of infectious diseases. While existing regulatory frameworks such as the “One Health” approach focus on increasing farms’ biosecurity and emergency preparedness, we emphasize the need to better align stakeholders’ incentives and to reduce meat consumption. We discuss in particular the implementation of a “zoonotic” Pigouvian tax, and innovations such as insect-based food or cultured meat. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Assessing progress towards achieving conservation targets is required for all countries committed to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Natura 2000 network is the largest protected area network in the world and was created to protect Europe's threatened species and habitats, often requiring active management. This study assesses the effectiveness of areas classified under the EU Birds Directive at protecting Western Europe's agro-steppes, the last remnants of suitable habitat for several endangered bird species. We quantify agro-steppe habitat change in the last 10 years using high-resolution aerial images of 21 Special Protection Areas and surrounding areas. The selected SPAs hold one third of the global population of great bustards Otis tarda, a flagship conservation species. Agro-steppe area losses occurred across all sites surveyed but were 45% lower inside Natura 2000 compared to non-protected areas. Natura 2000 sites still lost over 35,000 ha of agro-steppe habitat in 10 years, an area that could hold more than 500 great bustards. These low yield farmlands are being converted predominately to permanent and irrigated crops. At the current rate of habitat conversion, agro-steppes could be reduced to 50% of the present area during the next century. Moreover, the greater conversions outside protected sites may transform the remaining agro-steppes into isolated “islands” with low population connectivity. Our study on agro-steppes illustrates the relevant contribution of Natura 2000 at protecting Europe's key habitats, but also highlights crucial insufficiencies that still need to be addressed to achieve the CBD conservation targets and halt biodiversity loss. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Anthropogenic landscape change is a leading driver of biodiversity loss. Preceding dramatic changes such as wildlife population declines and range shifts, more subtle responses may signal impending larger-scale change. For example, disturbance-induced shifts to species’ activity patterns may disrupt temporal niche partitioning along the 24-h time axis, compromising community structure via altered competitive interactions. We investigated the impacts of human landscape disturbance on species’ activity patterns and temporal niche partitioning in the Canadian Rocky Mountain carnivore guild using camera trap images collected across two regions encompassing a wide gradient of human footprint. Applying kernel density estimation techniques, we tested for carnivore species’ activity shifts 1) between a low versus high disturbance landscape, and 2) in relation to site-scale disturbance. To test our hypothesis that human disturbance impacts species’ temporal niche partitioning, we modelled activity overlap between co-occurring carnivore species in relation to natural and anthropogenic landscape features, as well as carnivore community composition. Multiple carnivore species altered activity patterns between the low versus high disturbance landscapes and camera sites, but these shifts varied considerably among species. While wolves appeared to increase nocturnal activity in relation to disturbance, coyote activity consistently trended towards cathemerality and marten increased diurnal activity. Detecting effects of landscape disturbance on activity overlap between co-occurring species was highly sensitive to site-level detection sample sizes, and our results suggest altered temporal niche partitioning between marten and wolverine in relation to forest cover. This study indicates that mesocarnivores may respond differently and perhaps indirectly to anthropogenic disturbance compared to apex predators. Apex predator shifts to nocturnality may facilitate a ‘behavioural release’ in mesocarnivores. This may be a likely component of mesocarnivore population release, with important management implications for ecological communities on disturbed landscapes. © 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

abstract={Further progress in reducing biodiversity loss relies on the improved quantification of the connections between drivers of habitat loss and subsequent biodiversity impacts. To this end, biodiversity impact metrics should be able to report linked trends in specific human activities and changes in biodiversity state, accounting for both the ecology of different species and the cumulative effects of historical habitat losses. These characteristics are not currently captured within a single metric. Here, we develop a globally applicable methodological framework that uses freely and publicly available datasets to quantify the relative impacts of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity. We use species-specific habitat suitability models to link specific land uses to ensuing changes in the likelihood that local populations of those species will persist. To illustrate our approach, we assess the impacts of soy expansion and other land uses within the Brazilian Cerrado on over 2,000 species of amphibians, birds, mammals and plants for three periods between 2000 and 2014. Our results showed that mammals and plants suffered the greatest overall reduction of suitable habitat. However, among endemic and near-endemic species—which face greatest risk of global extinction from habitat conversion in the Cerrado—birds and mammals were the most affected groups. While conversion of natural vegetation to grassland and planted pastures were together responsible for most of the biodiversity impact of recent changes, soy expansion (via direct conversion of natural vegetation) had the greatest impact per unit area. The total biodiversity impact of recent land-use change was concentrated in the southern states of the Cerrado—Minas Geráis, Goiás and Mato Grosso—but the impact on biodiversity of production of soy was greatest within the agricultural frontiers of Bahía and Piauí. The flexibility of our approach to examine linkages between biodiversity loss and specific human activities has clear potential to better characterize the pathways by which habitat loss drivers operate. Its capacity to incorporate species-specific ecological needs, through a globally applicable methodology, can improve the tangibility of biodiversity loss assessments. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Context: Many large carnivores depend on habitat patches outside protected areas, as well as safe corridors between them. However, corridor assessments typically ignore potential conflicts between carnivores and people, which can undermine corridor effectiveness and thus conservation success. Objectives: We identified safe dispersal corridors and conflict-prone movement bottlenecks for Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor) between protected areas in the Alborz Mountains, Iran, by mapping habitat, landscape permeability, and conflict risk. We then identified priority areas for conservation interventions according to the intensities of different threats. Methods: We mapped land cover using Landsat satellite images, gathered data on leopard and prey distributions and livestock depredation events via interview surveys in 69 cells of 6 × 6 km each. We then used occupancy modeling to identify habitat patches, used circuit theory modeling to analyze landscape permeability, and assessed human-leopard conflict risk using generalized linear models. Results: Leopard habitat use increased with prey availability and decreased with elevation. Prey distribution, in turn, was mostly negatively influenced by agricultural lands and distance from protected areas. Conflict risk (i.e., probability of leopard depredation on livestock) was high in landscapes where agriculture was widespread and historical forest loss high. Not accounting for conflicts overestimated connectivity among habitat patches substantially. Conclusions: Human-carnivore conflicts are an important constraint to connectivity and should be considered in corridor assessments. Our study shows how habitat analysis, connectivity assessment, and conflict risk mapping can be combined to guide conservation planning for identifying habitat networks and safe corridors for carnivores in human-dominated landscapes. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Human-wildlife conflict is an important emerging threat producing biodiversity loss around the world. It is therefore key to study people's perceptions in order to overcome this conflict. Scavenger birds represent an interesting study case, since some people consider them beneficial but many have negative perceptions regarding their supposed potential role as livestock predators, resulting in intense conflicts with human populations. These conflicts could be responsible for harmful attitudes such as lethal control methods that affect the demography and conservation of scavenger bird populations. We studied the conflict between farmers and obligate and facultative scavenger birds in northwest Patagonia, Argentina, to ascertain whether people's perceptions are supported by field observations. We interviewed farmers and made field observations on farms in the same area. We found that 92% of the farmers believe that scavenger birds (including both obligate and facultative) present in the study area are harmful to livestock. However, our observations show that while some harm to livestock may occur, predation events are exceptional. Field observations thus do not support people's perceptions. We recommend the use of better livestock management and increased human presence during the birth of lambs in order to reduce the time during which scavenger birds can potentially cause harm. Our results are important for the development of better conservation policies to mitigate conflicts between farmers and scavenger birds based on scientific information, but at the same time considering local culture and perceptions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The Anthropocene is marked by twin crises: climate change and biodiversity loss. Climate change has tended to dominate the headlines, reflecting, in part, the greater complexity of the biodiversity crisis. Biodiversity itself is a difficult concept. Land plants dominate the global biomass and terrestrial arthropods probably dominate in terms of numbers of species, but most of the Tree of Life consists of single-celled eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea. Wild plants provide a huge variety of products and services to people, ranging from those that are species-specific, such as food, medicine, and genetic resources, to many which are partly interchangeable, such as timber and forage for domestic animals, and others which depend on the whole community, but not on individual species, such as regulation of water supply and carbon sequestration. The use of information from remote sensing has encouraged a simplified view of the values of nature's contributions to people, but this does not match the way most people value nature. We can currently estimate the proportion of species threatened by human impacts only for a few well-assessed groups, for which it ranges from 14% (birds) to 63% (cycads). Less than 8% of land plants have been assessed, but it has been estimated that 30–44% are threatened, although there are still few (0.2%) well-documented extinctions. Priorities for improving protection of biodiversity include: improving the inventory, with surveys focused on geographical areas and taxonomic groups which are under-collected; expanding the protected area system and its representativeness; controlling overexploitation; managing invasive species; conserving threatened species ex situ; restoring degraded ecosystems; and controlling climate change. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) COP15 and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP26 meetings, both postponed to 2021, will provide an opportunity to address both crises, but success will require high ambition from all participants. © 2020 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

abstract={Human advance on natural habitats is a major cause of biodiversity loss. This transformation process represents a profound change in wooded environments, disrupting original communities of flora and fauna. Many species are highly dependent on forests, especially parrots (Psittaciformes) with almost a third of their species threatened by extinction. Most parrot species occur in tropical and subtropical forests, and given the forest dependence of most species, this is the main reason why habitat loss has been highlighted as the main threat for the group. Such habitat loss acts in synergy with other important threats (e.g., logging and poaching), which become especially problematic in certain developing countries along tropical latitudes. In this study, we used available information on parrot distributions, species traits, IUCN assessment, habitat loss and timber extraction for different periods, and distribution of protected areas, to determine conservation hotspots for the group, and analyze potential changes in the conservation status of these species. We detected four conservation hotspots for parrots: two in the Neotropics and two in Oceania, all of them facing different degrees of threat in regard of current habitat loss and agricultural trends. Our results suggest that the future of the group is subject to policymaking in specific regions, especially in the northeastern Andes and the Atlantic Forest. In addition, we predicted that agricultural expansion will have a further negative effect on the conservation status of parrots, pushing many parrot species to the edge of extinction in the near future. Our results have conservation implications by recommending protected areas in specific parrot conservation hotspots. Our recommendations to mitigate conservation risks to this group of umbrella species would also benefit many other coexisting species as well. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Climate change and land use intensification are the two most common global change drivers of biodiversity loss. Like other organisms, the soil meso-fauna are expected to modify their functional diversity and composition in response to climate and land use changes. Here, we investigated the functional responses of Collembola, one of the most abundant and ecologically important groups of soil invertebrates. This study was conducted at the Global Change Experimental Facility (GCEF) in central Germany, where we tested the effects of climate (ambient vs. ‘future’ as projected for this region for the years between 2070 and 2100), land use (conventional farming, organic farming, intensively-used meadow, extensively-used meadow, and extensively-used pasture), and their interactions on the functional diversity (FD), community-weighted mean (CWM) traits (life-history, morphology), and functional composition of Collembola, as well as the Soil Biological Quality-Collembola (QBS-c) index. We found that land use was overwhelmingly the dominant driver of shifts in functional diversity, functional traits, and functional composition of Collembola, and of shifts in soil biological quality. These significant land use effects were mainly due to the differences between the two main land use types, i.e. cropland vs. grasslands. Specifically, Collembola functional biodiversity and soil biological quality were significantly lower in croplands than grasslands. However, no interactive effect of climate × land use was found in this study, suggesting that land use effects on Collembola were independent of the climate change scenario. Overall, our study shows that functional responses of Collembola are highly vulnerable to land use intensification under both climate scenarios. We conclude that land use changes reduce functional biodiversity and biological quality of soil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Conservation conflicts are gaining importance in contemporary conservation scholarship such that conservation may have entered a conflict hype. We attempted to uncover and deconstruct the normative assumptions behind such studies by raising several questions: what are conservation conflicts, what justifies the attention they receive, do conservation-conflict studies limit wildlife conservation, is scientific knowledge stacked against wildlife in conservation conflicts, do conservation-conflict studies adopt a specific view of democracy, can laws be used to force conservation outcomes, why is flexibility needed in managing conservation conflicts, can conservation conflicts be managed by promoting tolerance, and who needs to compromise in conservation conflicts? We suggest that many of the intellectual premises in the field may defang conservation and prevent it from truly addressing the current conservation crisis as it accelerates. By framing conservation conflicts as conflicts between people about wildlife or nature, the field insidiously transfers guilt, whereby human activities are no longer blamed for causing species decline and extinctions but conservation is instead blamed for causing social conflicts. When the focus is on mitigating social conflicts without limiting in any powerful way human activities damaging to nature, conservation-conflict studies risk keeping conservation within the limits of human activities, instead of keeping human activities within the limits of nature. For conservation to successfully stop the biodiversity crisis, we suggest the alternative goal of recognizing nature's right to existence to maintenance of ecological functions and evolutionary processes. Nature being a rights bearer or legal person would imply its needs must be explicitly taken into account in conflict adjudication. If, even in conservation, nature's interests come second to human interests, it may be no surprise that conservation cannot succeed. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology},

abstract={Accelerating global shifts in climate and land use change are altering natural habitats and species assemblages, making management interventions crucial to halt the biodiversity crisis. Management decisions must be informed by accurate biodiversity assessments. However, such assessments are often time consuming, expensive, and require specialist knowledge. Monitoring environmental sound may offer a novel method for rapid biodiversity assessment. Changes in species assemblages at a given location are reflected in the site's acoustic energy, termed the soundscape. Soundscapes can be readily described using acoustic indices; metrics based on objective features of recordings such as pitch and amplitude. Changes in acoustic indices values may therefore reflect changes in species assemblages, alerting land managers to shifts in wildlife populations. However, thus far, evidence supporting the use of acoustic indices in biodiversity monitoring has been equivocal. Here, we test the practical application of acoustic indices for biodiversity monitoring while solving methodological issues and providing conceptual clarity. Using 84 h of audio recordings covering 315 dawns from 43 sites, coupled with bird assemblage and vegetation data collected in the field, we demonstrate strong relationships between acoustic indices and avian species richness and abundance. In contrast with many previous studies, we found that sites with high bird species-richness and abundance had less even soundscapes (i.e. acoustic energy was less evenly distributed among frequencies) compared with sites with low species richness and abundance. Crucially, these patterns were coherent across multiple acoustic indices, and across habitat types, emphasising their utility for monitoring. Acoustic indices sensitive to the frequencies at which birds sing are most useful for monitoring avian communities; the Acoustic Evenness Index, Biophony Index, and the biophony component of the Normalised Difference Soundscape Index exhibited the strongest relationship with species richness. Land managers can use acoustic indices for biodiversity monitoring, complementing other, more established, assessment methods. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={The non-native pet trade contributes directly to species invasions, thereby threatening wildlife. Biological invasions influence environmental change, resulting in species extinctions and biodiversity loss. To mitigate the pet trade invasion risk, interventions are required to prevent trade in non-native animals with high invasion potential, impulse or ill-informed purchases of non-native pets by individuals who may release these animals, and the deliberate release of non-native animals by pet owners. Interventions are also required to prevent the establishment of non-native animals that have been released by pet owners (e.g., euthanasia). The successful implementation of these interventions depends on the support of pet owners and the public in the form of political support for, and compliance with, interventions. In 2017–2018, using both mail and online surveys, we measured the support of 1,171 members of the public and 550 owners of non-native pets in Florida, USA, for 7 different interventions to mitigate the pet trade invasion risk, and we investigated determinants of this support. We found that individuals' support for interventions depended on their concern related to the invasion risks associated with the pet trade, trust in government to manage the pet trade, perceptions of how effective interventions would be in mitigating the pet trade invasion risk, and demographic characteristics. Support for interventions differed across pet owners and the public. Educating pet owners about the traits and cost of care for non-native animals and providing them with options to relinquish unwanted pets may reduce the pet trade invasion risk. Engaging the pet trade in the design of interventions to mitigate invasion risks is likely important to attain voluntary compliance with these interventions. The effectiveness of interventions also depends on enforcement by agencies. Implementing interventions that effectively reduce the pet trade invasion risk is important to protect native and endangered wildlife. © 2020 The Wildlife Society. © 2020 The Wildlife Society},

abstract={Predicting how communities re-arrange in response to changes in species composition remains a key challenge in ecology. Migratory species, which enter and leave communities across latitudinal gradients, offer us a unique opportunity to evaluate community- and species-level responses to a shift in community composition. We focused on a migratory hummingbird and the communities that host it along a latitudinal and species diversity gradient. Our results show higher niche overlap in more diverse communities, allowing resident species to compensate for the loss of the migrant in providing pollination services. Contrastingly, in less diverse communities, the migrant behaves as a specialist, monopolizing abundant resources. In its absence, its role is not fully covered by resident species, resulting in a decrease in the fruit set of the migrant's preferred plant species. These results help us understand the potential impacts of biodiversity loss and have important implications for community persistence given expected changes in the migratory behaviours of some species. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={The expansion of oil palm agriculture has contributed to biodiversity loss in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the tropics. Riparian reserves (areas of native forest along waterways) have the potential to maintain forest biodiversity and associated ecological processes within these agricultural landscapes. Using acoustic sampling, we investigated the value of riparian reserves for insectivorous bats in oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We compared general bat activity, foraging activity, and species occupancy between riparian areas in forest and riparian reserves in oil palm plantations. Overall bat activity varied little between riparian reserves in oil palm and riparian forest. Rather, activity was greatest in areas with a high forest canopy, irrespective of how much forest was available within or outside the riparian reserve. Bat foraging activity, as well as the occupancy of two species, was greatest in the forest sites, and while bats were detected in the oil palm riparian reserves, both foraging and occupancy were more associated with topographic ruggedness than forest amount or height. Our results indicate that habitat structure within riparian reserves may be more important than reserve size for supporting insectivorous bat diversity within oil palm landscapes. These findings provide important insights into the extent of the ecological benefits provided by conservation set-asides in forest-agricultural landscapes in the tropics. © Copyright © 2020 Mullin, Yoh, Mitchell, Basrur, Seaman, Bernard and Struebig.},

abstract={Expanding conservation efforts to private land is paramount to halt biodiversity loss and achieve global conservation targets. Individual landowners can play disproportionately important roles by establishing private parks and managing them with biodiversity-focused objectives. However, several constraints hinder the expansion of such initiatives, and little is known about their extent, characteristics and keys for success. Here, we provide insights on the conditions that favoured the establishment and conservation outcomes of a private reserve in central Spain whose management has been fully conservation-oriented for the past two decades. We report on the actions implemented to accomplish four key targets that aimed at protecting and enhancing wildlife populations, and on the landholder's motivations to devote his personal resources to pursue this goal. After acquiring the land, the landowner has made efforts to restore native wildlife populations after decades of poaching and intensive cattle raising. Key actions included re-establishing degraded vegetation and fostering keystone rabbit populations to sustain carnivore populations. Water bodies are maintained to provide drinking points and foster aquatic animal populations; nest boxes target birds and bats. Many actions resulted from advice from multiple stakeholders, including public administration officers, academics, local residents and NGOs. The estate's formal conservation status has made it a partner in major conservation projects, including repeated releases of captively bred Iberian lynx. The landowner's determination for long-term conservation was formalised through a legal protected-area status. The condition that drove the creation of the reserve was the landowner's intrinsic motivation, which resulted from conservation ethic, personal identity and the desire to share and educate about the multiple values of nature. Additionally, several external conditions, such as accessibility and appropriate reserve size (biophysical conditions), the lack of need for economic activities (economic), a positive and pro-active relationship with multiple stakeholders (social-cultural), the protected-area status and the capacity to make decisions independently (governance-related), have helped sustain the project. The landholder suggests that public policy should reduce the bureaucratic burden to intrinsically motivated landowners and provide them technical advice, trust and financial incentives to expand conservation on private land. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Many governments and conservation organisations have argued that hunter-gatherers, farmers and pastoralists are responsible, in considerable part, for environmental degradation and biodiversity losses in southern Africa. Particular attention has been paid to alleged wildlife losses, especially elephants in Botswana. This article considers some of the issues surrounding hunting bans and protected areas with a view to conserving elephants. In Botswana, local people were removed from protected areas after being blamed for declines in wildlife numbers. Utilising government and other scientific wildlife data, the hunting ban cannot be shown to have had any significant impact on the conservation of elephants and other game species. Local people argue that many of their activities are sustainable, maintaining that they are generally not responsible for biodiversity losses and environmental degradation. Population growth, the expansion of agricultural, livestock and mining activities, the construction of veterinary cordon fences and increases in water point distribution have led to localised environmental degradation. The 'great elephant debate' became an important political issue during the run-up to the Botswana elections of October 2019. Local communities sought to ensure that they would be able to obtain benefits from wildlife tourism which had been denied them during the hunting ban. © 2020 Hitchcock et al.},

abstract={Biodiversity conservation focuses on species and/or populations, but preserving genetic diversity and structure has received limited attention and even less maintaining species evolutionary potential over generations. Genetic diversity is an essential component of biodiversity enabling species’ persistence, particularly under disturbances. Via sexual reproduction genetic diversity is transmitted across generations and greater outcrossing in parental populations will lead to greater genetic diversity in their offspring. Grazing by exotic large herbivores is one of the main disturbances driving biodiversity loss threatening rangelands sustainability worldwide. We investigated grazing effects on fitness and genetic diversity of parental and offspring cohorts of Prosopis alpataco from Patagonian Monte Desert. We collected fresh leaves and seeds from 10 independent rangelands with different herbivore density, forming a grazing gradient, and estimated genetic parameters from allele frequencies using isoenzymes. We recorded plant size, seed weight, seed set, seedling emergence and mortality as proxies of plant fitness. Applying regression models and path analysis (D-separation) approaches we observed that increasing grazing reduced seed set and seedling emergence, and significantly increased seedling mortality. Parental and offspring suffered from inbreeding. Moreover, we found genetic diversity loss throughout cohorts in all rangelands, however, this loss was relatively lower at intermediate grazing intensities. The introduction of large herbivores in unmanaged rangelands affected vegetation structure, jeopardizing their evolutionary potential and system sustainability. Therefore, natural revegetation may be compromised by aggravated genetic diversity losses along generations that might be deepened in drylands under forecasted climate change. This highlights the importance of evaluating and conserving genetic diversity. © 2020 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação},

abstract={The impact of artisanal fisheries on marine turtle populations is still understudied in the southern Caribbean. In the Venezuelan Guajira Peninsula, artisanal fishing of marine turtles by the indigenous Wayuú people has occurred for generations. Nevertheless, understanding the issues regarding turtle take is challenging. Surveys and semi-structured interviews were carried out at eight landing sites located in three different zones in Kazuzain village, Middle Guajira. Carapaces or plastrons were recorded to estimate take level, and measured to determine life stage. Minimum take was 167 marine turtles over 53 weeks, or 3.15 turtles/week on average (estimated 163.8/yr). Most records encountered were from green turtles (n=154; 92.2%), and the majority of these were immature (n=76; 89.4%). Key-informants reported that marine turtles were not the target catch. However, most interviewees affirmed that take of marine turtles in Kazuzain is not only for traditional purposes, but also to meet economic shortfalls. They also stated that trade of marine turtles has increased over the last ten years due to the Venezuelan economic crisis. This is the first assessment of marine turtle take in this village and fills an information gap that can aid resource managers to mitigate the impacts of take, and develop potential conservation solutions for marine turtle aggregations and the people that depend on them. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Wild boar are considered one the world’s worst invasive species and linked to biodiversity loss, competition for resources, predation of native species, and habitat modifications. In this study, we use camera traps to evaluate whether the invasive wild boar had an effect on the medium-sized mammal community of a protected area in southern Brazil. Based on photographic records, we evaluated whether the presence and relative abundance of wild boar was associated with a decrease in diversity or change in activity of medium-sized mammals. All comparisons were made between samples where wild boar were present or absent. The records of each camera during a season were considered a sample. The wild boar was the fourth most common species in the study area being present in 7.8% of the photographic records. The species richness of mammals was not negatively affected by the occurrence of wild boar and most common species did not exhibit changes in the daily activity pattern. However, we recorded an increase in the time elapsed between an observation of wild boar and the record of the next species relative to the average latency period observed among other mammalian species. This average latency period was similar to that observed in the case of large predators such as Puma, and its increase could be reflective partly of the avoidance of native species to wild boar. Nevertheless, our results show that the effect of invasive wild boar on the mammal community is not large as expected. © 2020 Silveira de Oliveira et al.

abstract={The construction of artificial structures, such as seawalls, is increasing globally, resulting in loss of habitat complexity and native species biodiversity. There is increasing interest in mitigating this biodiversity loss by adding topographic habitat to these structures, and/or seeding them with habitat-forming species. Settlement tile experiments, comparing colonisation of species to more and less complex habitats, have been used to inform eco-engineering interventions prior to their large-scale implementation. Most studies have focused on applying one type of intervention (either adding habitat structure or seeding with native organisms), so it is unclear whether there are greater benefits to biodiversity when multiple interventions are combined. Using a fully orthogonal experiment, we assessed the independent and interactive effects of habitat structure (flat vs. crevice/ridges) and seeding with native oysters (unseeded vs. seeded) on the biodiversity of four different functional groups (sessile and mobile taxa, cryptobenthic and pelagic fishes). Concrete tiles (flat unseeded, flat seeded, complex unseeded and complex seeded) were deployed at two sites in Sydney Harbour and monitored over 12 months, for the survival and colonisation of oysters and the species density and abundances of the four functional groups. The survival of seeded oysters was greater on the complex than flat tiles, at one of the two sites, due to the protective role of crevices. Despite this, after 12 months, the species density of sessile invertebrates and the percentage cover of seeded and colonising oysters did not differ between complex and seeded tiles each of which supported more of these variables than the flat unseeded tiles. In contrast, the species density of mobile invertebrates and cryptobenthic fishes and the MaxN of pelagic fishes, at 1 month, were only positively influenced by seeding with oysters, which provided food as well as habitat. Within the complex seeded and unseeded tiles, there was a greater species density of sessile taxa, survival and percentage cover of oysters in the crevices, which were more humid and darker at month 12, had lower high temperature extremes at months 1 and 12, than on the ridges or flat tiles. Our results suggest that ecoengineering projects which seek to maximise the biodiversity of multiple functional groups on seawalls, should apply a variety of different microhabitats and habitat-forming species, to alter the environmental conditions available to organisms. © 2020 Strain et al.

abstract={Ecological niche models (ENMs) are widely used tools for predicting species geographic distribution as a function of environmental variables. The inclusion of biotic factors in the predictor suite can significantly increase the predictive power of such models, leading to a model closer to the realized niche for the species under investigation. In this study, we provide evidence of niche overlap between gray woolly monkeys (Lagothrix cana) and black-faced black spider monkeys (Ateles chamek) based on locality and ecological data covering their complete geographic range in the Amazon forests of Brazil, Peru and Bolivia. We also estimate the potential distribution of L. cana using environmental predictors, and the distribution of A. chamek as a biotic factor. Finally, we quantified current and future habitat loss and areas under legal protection. We found that only 39% of the L. cana area of occupancy is under legal protection and that the species could potentially lose up to 58% of habitat in the next 30 years. We also show that the use of a closely-related species that has a more robust dataset can improve ENMs of poorly studied, rare and/or cryptic species. The framework developed here can be applied to a wide range of sympatric species if they share similar ecological requirements. Since our focal species are the most frugivorous primates in our study region and especially vulnerable to habitat loss, the identification of highly suitable areas for both taxa can help to protect other forest-dwelling species, reducing the rate of overall biodiversity loss. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={The conversion of tropical forests to farmland is a key driver of the current extinction crisis. With the present rate of deforestation unlikely to subside, secondary forests that regenerate on abandoned agricultural land may provide an option for safeguarding biodiversity. While species richness (SR) may recover as secondary forests get older, the extent to which phylogenetic diversity (PD)—the total amount of evolutionary history present in a community—is conserved is less clear. Maximizing PD has been argued to be important to conserve both evolutionary heritage and ecosystem function. Here, we investigate the effects of secondary forest regeneration on PD in birds. The regeneration of secondary forests could lead to a community of closely related species, despite maintaining comparable SR to primary forests, and thus have diminished biodiversity value with reduced evolutionary heritage. We use a meta-dataset of paired primary and secondary forest sites to show that, over time, forest specialist species returned across all sites as secondary forest age increased. Forest specialists colonize secondary tropical forests in both the Old World and the New World, but recovery of PD and community composition with time is only evident in the Old World. Synthesis and applications. While preserving primary tropical forests remains a core conservation goal, our results emphasize the important role of secondary forest in maintaining tropical forest biodiversity. Biodiversity recovery differs between Old and New World secondary forests and with proximity to primary forest, highlighting the need to consider local or regional differences in landscape composition and species characteristics, especially resilience to forest degradation and dispersal capability. While farmland abandonment is increasing across marginal areas in the tropics, there remains a critical need to provide long-term management and protection from reconversion to maximize conservation benefits of secondary forests. Our study suggests such investments should be focused on land in close proximity to primary forests. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Classifying species into groups based on taxonomic relationship and functions are objective approaches to evaluate environmental and anthropogenic influences on coastal fishes. We evaluated temporal (1993–1995 and 2012–2015) changes in the taxonomic and functional indices in three zones of a tropical bay heavily impacted over the recent decades. We tested the hypothesis that both indices decrease over time as result of the environmental degradation. A decrease in the taxonomic richness and abundance was observed mainly of the inner zone. The functional structure remained relatively stable, but the functional originality decreased significantly between the two periods. This functional loss is of particular concern because the loss of species with unique treats may generate a series of ecosystem damage. This information tells us that the use of functional indices is essential to complement taxonomic assessments and to detect a more detailed understanding of the real dimension of biodiversity loss in impacted environments. © 2020},

abstract={Recent droughts raise global concern over potential biodiversity loss and mitigating impacts to vulnerable species has become a management priority. However, drought impacts on populations are difficult to predict, in part, because habitat refuges can buffer organisms from harsh environmental conditions. In a global change context, more extreme droughts may turn previously suitable habitats into ecological traps, where vulnerable species can no longer persist. Here, we explore the impacts of California's recent record-breaking drought on endangered juvenile Coho salmon. We estimated the variability of cumulative salmon survival using mark–recapture of nearly 20,000 tagged fish in intermittent stream pools during a 7-year period encompassing drought and non-drought conditions. We then determined the relative importance of physical habitat, streamflow, precipitation, landscape, and biological characteristics that may limit survival during drought. Our most striking result was an increase in the number of pools with reduced or zero survival during drought years and a coincident increase in spatial variability in survival among study reaches. In nearly half of the stream pools, salmon survival during drought was similar to mean survival of pools assessed during non-drought years, indicating some pools had remarkable resistance (ability to withstand disturbance) to extreme drought. Lower survival was most attributable to longer duration of disconnection between upstream and downstream habitats, a consequence of increasing drought severity. Our results not only suggest that many pools sustain juvenile salmon in non-drought years transition into ecological traps during drought but also highlight that some pools serve as refuges even under extreme drought conditions. Projected increases in drought severity that lead to longer droughts and greater habitat fragmentation could transform an increasing proportion of suitable habitats into ecological traps. Predicting future impacts of drought on Coho salmon and other sensitive species will require identification and protection of drought refuges and management strategies that prevent further habitat fragmentation. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Monitoring long-term changes in aquatic biodiversity requires the effective use of historical data that were collected with different methods and varying levels of effort. Aggregating data into different spatial scales can control for such differences and provide a robust framework for monitoring distribution trends. We used a quantitative, multi-scale assessment to evaluate the potential drivers of distribution change for 60 fish species at three spatial scales, using 503 unique sampling events conducted between 1931 and 2019 in a stream biodiversity hotspot (French Creek, Pennsylvania, U.S.A). Trends delineated at multiple scales demonstrated that only one cyprinid species consistently declined through time. In contrast, several species, particularly centrarchids (bass and sunfish), appeared to increase with time. However, evidence for species’ increases varied among the different spatial scales, and our observations suggest that differences in effort and detection across time periods may contribute to patterns of species increases. There was agreement among scales that agricultural land use, non-native brown trout (Salmo trutta), and anthropogenic barriers did not explain patterns in biodiversity change from the distribution trends in this study. The lack of species declines is likely due to the limited levels of historical impacts in the watershed compared with other locations in the region that experienced more acute pollution bottlenecks. Species increases were most prevalent for sportfish and baitfish species, suggesting that distribution increases were human mediated. Similar multi-scale assessments should provide more robust insight into patterns of biodiversity loss and distribution changes by maximizing the use of historical data. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Ghost fishing, the ability of fishing equipment to continue to capture organisms even after it is no longer controlled, leads to serious marine impacts, including bycatch, which contributes to biodiversity loss. Insistent complaints from artisanal fisher in the state of Bahia, Brazil, concerning the impacts of nets lost or abandoned by fisher from other regions that operate in their traditional fishing territory were brought to the attention of our research group. Therefore, this study aims to describe the knowledge and classify fisher perceptions in south Bahia regarding ghost fisheries in the region, as well as the resulting impacts and fisher ideas for solving this problem in a coastal coral reef region. Semi-structured interviews were conducted between August 2015 and September 2017 with 60 fishers, 59 men and one woman, that fish with hand lines and hooks in the studied area. A total of 90% of respondents (n = 54) reported having found ghost nets in their ancestral fishing territories, while 93% (n = 56) associated ghost nets with financial losses and marine environment impacts. Most respondents (n = 56; 93%) also indicated lower fishery yields due to ghost nets and indicated (n = 55; 91.9%) that most ghost nets found in the area are used for lobster fishing, which is banned in Brazil. Fishers revealed an active interest in solving this socio-environmental problem, demonstrating detailed knowledge related to the loss of fishing nets in the local marine environment, as they have been finding and removing ghost nets from the local sea. Fisher's ideas to solve this problem included the implementation of fines for fishers caught in breach of regional and national fisheries regulations, and management actions, such as ghost net removal from the sea. Establishing partnerships between fisher and the federal government in curbing ghost fisheries is crucial. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) have been produced in captivity for reintroduction programs since the 1980s, using techniques such as artificial insemination, multiple clutching, and captive-rearing to speed recovery efforts. Chicks are often hand-reared (HR) by caretakers in crane costumes, socialized into groups and released together, unlike parent-reared (PR) cranes that are raised individually by a male/female crane pair and released singly. HR cranes historically exhibit greater morbidity rates during development than PR cranes, involving musculoskeletal and respiratory system disease, among others. We hypothesized that HR crane chicks exhibit a higher baseline fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations during the development compared with PR chicks. Fecal samples were collected between 15 and 70 days of age from HR (n = 15) and PR (n = 8) chicks to test for differences in FGM concentrations using a radioimmunoassay technique following ethanol extraction for steroids. Linear mixed model analysis suggests increasing age of the chick was associated with an increase in FGM (p <.001). Analysis also supported the interaction between rearing strategy and sex of the crane chick (p <.01). Female PR chicks had greater FGM concentrations than all other groups (PR male, p <.01; HR female, p <.001; and HR male, p <.001). This result suggests that there may be an effect of rearing strategy on stress physiology of whooping crane chicks, especially among females. Further research is needed to investigate whether the FGM concentrations are reflective of true differences in stress physiology of young cranes and whether this may impact health and conservation success. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Logging and human-induced conversion of natural forests into agricultural areas are major drivers of biodiversity loss in the tropics. Anuran larvae can be highly diverse, can reach high biomass and can play important roles in tropical streams; yet, compared to the adult frog communities, relatively little is known about how larval communities respond to disturbance. Information on larvae is highly relevant for amphibian conservation because larvae represent direct evidence of breeding and thus provide a good indicator of species persistence in disturbed habitats. We studied tadpole assemblages in Ranomafana, southeastern part of Madagascar, in streams in a disturbed forest (previously logged forest), at “forest edge” (streams embedded in matrix nearby forest blocks), and compared these to communities in a primary forest. We sampled tadpoles at the microhabitat level (“pools” and “riffles”) in 9 streams. We recorded 27 species with a maximum of 17 species/stream recorded at edge. The three habitats harbored different assemblages, but, as could be expected, more similarities existed among forest habitats than between forest and non-forest habitats. The most and the least diverse communities were recorded at edge and in the disturbed forest, respectively. Assemblages were dominated by one generalist species, and changes in communities were mostly driven by changes in forest specialists, which either decreased in disturbed forest or were replaced by edge specialists outside forest. Although species richness varied, relative abundances were maintained among habitats, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms in tadpole biomass. Community structure changed at the microhabitat level: pool environments usually harbored relatively higher species richness and abundance than riffles. Our study highlights the relevance of edge habitats for maintaining amphibian diversity and the pronounced negative effects of past logging activities on tadpole communities. Given the diverse roles of tadpoles in streams, changes in community structure potentially affect critical stream ecosystem processes. The study has strong implications for designing buffer zones around protected areas. © 2020, International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering.},

abstract={Human pressure on the environment is driving a global decline of biodiversity. Anticipating whether this trend can be reverted under future scenarios is key to supporting policy decisions. We used the InSiGHTS framework to model the impacts of land-use and climate change on future habitat availability for 2,827 terrestrial mammals at 15 arcmin resolution under five contrasting global scenarios based on combinations of representative concentration pathways and shared socio-economic pathways between 2015 and 2050. Mammal habitat declined globally by 5%–16% depending on the scenario. Africa (with declines up to 25%) and South America were the most affected regions. African insectivores, primates, Australian carnivorous marsupials and marsupial moles, and South American opossums declined the most. Tackling this loss would require a mix of actions across scales, including a global shift toward sustainability, addressing land-use change in sub-Saharan Africa, and helping endemic species track climate change in South America. Human pressure is the main driver of modern biodiversity loss. Biodiversity and ecosystem services are universally agreed to be a precious resource for human societies and essential for human survival. Global scenarios of societal development can help us understand the implications of international policies on nations' abilities to secure access to food, energy, and resources, but they commonly ignore impacts on biodiversity. It is therefore essential that we be able to understand and anticipate the possible effects of these decisions on biodiversity. We find that a single strategy might have widely different impacts on biodiversity in different world regions. Also, seemingly valid strategies (from a societal perspective) could have serious negative repercussions on mammals, with expected losses of between 5% and 16%. A great deal of cooperation and more ambitious strategies than the ones currently being studied will be needed if we are to avoid the greatest impacts on the world's species. We used the InSiGHTS framework to model impacts of land-use and climate change on future habitat for 2,827 terrestrial mammals under five contrasting global scenarios based on combinations of representative concentration pathways and shared socio-economic pathways, between 2015 and 2050.

There are 515 species on the brink (1.7% of the evaluated vertebrates). Around 94% of the populations of 77mammal and bird species on the brink have been lost in the last century. Assuming all species on the brink have similar trends, more than 237,000 populations of those species have vanished since 1900. We conclude the human-caused sixth mass extinction is likely accelerating for several reasons. First, many of the species that have been driven to the brink will likely become extinct soon. Second, the distribution of those species highly coincides with hundreds of other endangered species, surviving in regions with high human impacts, suggesting ongoing regional biodiversity collapses. Third, close ecological interactions of species on the brink tend to move other species toward annihilation when they disappear-extinction breeds extinctions. Finally, human pressures on the biosphere are growing rapidly, and a recent example is the current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, linked to wildlife trade. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking much-expanded worldwide actions to save wild species and humanity's crucial life-support systems from this existential threat. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={One technique used to combat the growing global species extinction crisis has been to create artificial refuges—human-made replacements for natural refuges destroyed during habitat modification. However, there is limited knowledge of how closely artificial refuges replicate the natural refuges they seek to replace. Mining threatens many species worldwide through large-scale habitat modification, and artificial refuges have been proposed as a method to offset the resulting habitat loss. Here, we examined the microclimatic, physical, and biotic characteristics of natural dens occupied by the northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus)—an endangered marsupial threatened by habitat loss—and compared these to (a) superficially similar unoccupied crevices, and (b) artificial dens created by mining companies for northern quolls. Northern quolls occupied natural dens that were cooler and deeper than unoccupied crevices, likely to avoid lethal air temperatures as well as predators. Artificial dens provided similar thermal properties to occupied dens, but lacked key characteristics in having shallower den cavities, less complex surrounding habitat, increased feral cat visitation, and less small mammal prey compared to occupied dens. This study highlights the need to consider multiple facets when constructing artificial refuges, in order to avoid perverse outcomes, such as inadequate shelter, increased predation, and food shortages. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Biological invasions represent one of the main causes of the current biodiversity loss. Assessing distribution of invasive species is therefore pivotal to design effective management plans. In this work, we reviewed the current distribution of the Common Myna Acridotheres tristis in Italy. The Myna is recorded as an invasive species in many other countries worldwide. We used citizen-science and online platforms, to obtain a reliable map of the distribution of breeding populations, as very few data have been published on the distribution of this bird in Italy. We found 34 occurrences of the Common Myna in Italy, and breeding has been confirmed in two areas in Campania (Southern Italy), i.e. in the provinces of Salerno and Caserta. To prevent this species to become invasive in Italy, given the current limited distribution of breeding populations, a rapid removal of free-ranging individuals should be recommended in the short-term period. © 2020 CISO - Centro Italiano Studi Ornitologici.},

abstract={Coastal wetlands are one of the most productive ecosystems in the world and provide diverse environmental services such as water, climate regulation, food, and recreation and spiritual enjoyment. Nevertheless, the rapid processes of degradation and destruction that wetlands face have managed to dramatically alter their biocapacity and resilience. Complete and updated information is vital for coastal planning and strategic management. A comprehensive study of the socio-ecological system of the Bahía Blanca estuary is presented. The method used is based on the conceptual framework of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment designed by the United Nations. The results obtained affirmed that the most important pressures on the estuary are due to infrastructure concentration on the coastal edge, dredging and artificial filling of wetlands, environmental contamination, and the invasion of exotic species. The direct consequences on the welfare of the local population are a decrease in fish supply, loss of tourism resources (habitat and landscape degradation, as well as biodiversity loss), health problems derived from air pollution, and conflicts between resource users (as is the case of artisanal fishermen and industrial companies). It is expected that the operational diagnosis made will facilitate an understanding of the current problems of the study area and encourage the search for integral solutions. © 2020 Interuniversity Institute of Geography and University of Alicante.

abstract={Social-ecological and biocultural systems connect people to their environment at the intersection of nature and culture. The harvest of local wildlife for human consumption is critically important to the food security of the world’s Indigenous peoples and to the conservation of biodiversity, either as a driver of biodiversity loss or of biodiversity protection, depending on system properties. By their nature, local food systems are assumed to be both ecologically determined and culturally defined. Here, we analyze standardized local food consumption surveys conducted in 21 Indigenous communities across northern North America. Using measures of dietary similarity from the ecological sciences and a variance partitioning statistical approach, we reveal a profound and prevailing importance of culture in defining the types and amounts of animal species consumed as food, operating within the environmental constraint of local availability. This quantitative, multicommunity analysis reveals the sustainability and cultural agency inherent in local food systems and the importance of cultural-ecological coupling in an era of accelerating social and environmental change. © 2020 by the author(s).

abstract={Threatened species recovery programs are increasingly turning to reintroductions to reverse biodiversity loss. Here we present a real-world example where tactics (techniques which influence post-release performance and persistence) and an adaptive management framework (which incorporates feedback between monitoring and future actions) improved reintroduction success. Across three successive trials we investigated the influence of tactics on the effective survival and post-release dispersal of endangered eastern quolls (Dasyurus viverrinus) reintroduced into Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary, Australian Capital Territory. Founders were monitored for 42 days post-release, and probability of survival and post-release dispersal were tested against trial, origin, sex, den sharing and presence of pouch young. We adopted an adaptive management framework, using monitoring to facilitate rapid learning and to implement interventions that improved reintroduction success. Founders released in the first trial were less likely to survive (28.6%, n = 14) than those founders released the second (76.9%, n = 13) and third trials (87.5%, n = 8). We adapted several tactics in the second and third trials, including the selection of female-only founders to avoid elevated male mortality, and post-mating releases to reduce stress. Founders that moved dens between consecutive nights were less likely to survive, suggesting that minimising post-release dispersal can increase the probability of survival. The probability of moving dens was lower in the second and third trials, for females, and when den sharing with another founder. This study demonstrates that, through iterative trials of tactics involving monitoring and learning, adaptive management can be used to significantly improve the success of reintroduction programs. © 2020 Wilson et al.},

abstract={Invasive alien species (IAS) are among the main causes of global biodiversity loss. Invasive brown (Rattus norvegicus) and black (R. rattus) rats, in particular, are leading drivers of extinction on islands, especially in the case of seabirds where >50% of all extinctions have been attributed to rat predation. Eradication is the primary form of invasive rat management, yet this strategy has resulted in a ~10-38% failure rate on islands globally. Genetic tools can help inform IAS management, but such applications to date have been largely reactive, time-consuming, and costly. Here, we developed a Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing (GT-seq) panel for rapid species identification and population assignment of invasive brown and black rats (RapidRat) in Haida Gwaii, an archipelago comprising ~150 islands off the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. We constructed an optimized panel of 443 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using previously generated double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) genotypic data (27,686 SNPs) from brown (n = 295) and black rats (n = 241) sampled throughout Haida Gwaii. The informativeness of this panel for identifying individuals to species and island of origin was validated relative to the ddRAD results; in all comparisons, admixture coefficients and population assignments estimated using RapidRat were consistent. To demonstrate application, 20 individuals from novel invasions of three islands (Agglomerate, Hotspring, Ramsay) were genotyped using RapidRat, all of which were confidently assigned (>98.5% probability) to Faraday and Murchison Islands as putative source populations. These results indicated that a previous eradication on Hotspring Island was conducted at an inappropriate geographic scale; future management should expand the eradication unit to include neighboring islands to prevent re-invasion. Overall, we demonstrated that RapidRat is an effective tool for managing invasive rat populations in Haida Gwaii and provided a clear framework for GT-seq panel development for informing biodiversity conservation in other systems.

abstract={Conservation interventions in developing countries are frequently thwarted by socio-economic agendas, severely limiting the scope and rigor of biodiversity and habitat conservation. Very few ecological assessments incorporate human interests in conservation prioritization, creating asynchrony between planning and implementation. For conservation actions to be logistically feasible, multiple criteria including ecological, social, economic and administrative aspects must be considered. Understanding how these different dimensions interact spatially is also important for gauging the potential for conservation success. Here, we use a guild of select mammalian carnivores (wild canids and hyenas) in India to (i) generate distribution maps at the spatial scale of administrative sub-districts, that are relevant to management, (ii) examine ecological, social and biogeographic factors associated with their distribution, assess key threats, and identify areas important for their conservation, (iii) use prioritization tools for balancing habitat conservation, human needs and economic growth, and (iv) evaluate the spatial congruence between areas with high conservation potential, and areas currently in focus for protection efforts, conservation investments, and infrastructure development. We find that the current Protected Area system does not adequately cover or represent diverse habitats, that there is immense potential for States to increase financial investments towards alternative conservation strategies, and, most infrastructure projects may be potentially jeopardizing important carnivore habitats where the two overlap. Our framework allowed for identifying locations where conservation investments would lead to the highest benefits for carnivores as flagships, which also benefit other species across habitats. We make a case for re-evaluating how large-scale prioritization assessments are made, and for broadening the purview of conservation policies in India and other developing countries. © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Ungulates are key elements that modulate the type and direction of ecosystem services in Mediterranean environments. Our main objective is to synthesize the provision of ecosystem services in forests, shrublands and woodlands dominated by ungulates (wildlife or livestock) in Mediterranean environments. To achieve this objective, we performed a systematic semi-quantitative review (n = 262 studies) across the Mediterranean climate area for the 1991−2018 period. Most studies focused on supporting services (80.35 % of all studies), with biodiversity (49.11 %) and plant recruitment (18.15 %) as the most studied services. A great number of studies addressed plant biodiversity preservation (63.40 % of studies on biodiversity). Surprisingly, we found a low number of studies on cultural (7.02 %) and regulatory (5.26 %) services. Regarding the direction of the relationship of ungulate effects on ecosystem services, 67 studies (25.57 %) showed positive effects and 86 studies (32.82 %) mentioned negative effects (disservices). Most studies that showed positive effects focused on biodiversity, mainly vegetation and birds, and wildfire prevention. However, most studies reporting negative effects were also based on biodiversity loss (mainly vegetation) and plant recruitment failure. Distribution of services remained similar across regions and species but positive effects of ungulates were reported mainly in shrublands and negative effects were reported primarily in forests and woodlands. Despite the fact that ungulate density is key to explain the direction of ungulate effects on ecosystem services, only 9.51 % of all studies considered different estimates of herbivore pressure and just 7.22 % of all studies considered different contrasted densities in the analysis. Overall, our analysis of services showed a decreasing tolerance to ungulate pressure from woodlands, through forests, to shrublands. Mean ± SE ungulate densities (Livestock Units per ha) in studies that showed negative effects were 0.20 ± 0.01 in shrublands, 0.22 ± 0.01 in forests, and 1.98 ± 1.70 in woodlands (including dehesas, montados and rangelands). Management in Mediterranean woody ecosystems should focus on neglected services (e.g. regulatory services) and try to adjust ungulate population densities to maximize positive effects and minimize negative effects on ecosystem services. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={The effects of anthropogenic disturbance upon the stability of wildlife communities depend on the heterogeneity and connectivity of habitat remnants on multiple scales. The number of hydroelectric dams in biodiversity hotspots (Africa, South America and Asia) is growing rapidly. To establish their environmental impact, it is essential to understand the dynamics of wildlife communities before and following the establishment of dams. We evaluated the impacts of the filling of the Serra do Facão hydroelectric reservoir in the São Marcos river, central Brazil, on the bird community. Using data from 1,145 surveys across 20 sampling sites over 8 years, 2 years before and 6 years after the filling of the reservoir, we assessed the resistance, i.e. maintenance close to an equilibrium state during the disturbance, and resilience, i.e. ability to return to the original state following the disturbance, of the bird community. We used spatiotemporal hierarchical Bayesian models to assess the effects of reservoir filling on five community parameters: abundance, richness, phylogenetic diversity, functional diversity and species composition. In the period subsequent to reservoir filling, there was (a) a marked reduction in bird abundance, richness, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity, and (b) a reduction in the proportion of forest species, coupled with an increase in the proportion of savanna species. Except for bird abundance, none of the other community attributes returned to their original levels, even after 6 years. Our findings indicate that Cerrado bird communities have both low resistance and low resilience to habitat loss associated with the establishment of hydroelectric reservoirs. Synthesis and applications. The environmental costs of hydroelectric dams are still underestimated or neglected in Brazil. A new paradigm in the assessment of their environmental impacts is warranted, incorporating (a) models of spatiotemporal variations based on long-term monitoring with surveys initiated before disturbances and (b) measures of functional and phylogenetic diversity, such that society can understand the costs and benefits of the establishment of new hydroelectric dams and make informed decisions. Biodiversity loss could be minimized by ensuring the preservation and connectivity of alluvial habitats, capable of maintaining the supply of resources and the functional and phylogenetic attributes of bird communities associated with such habitats. © 2020 British Ecological Society},

abstract={Monitoring and evaluation is an essential stage of conservation implementation, offering a wide variety of benefits including the ability to engage in informed adaptive management. Understanding the relationship among actions, outputs, and outcomes can inform on factors acting to facilitate or hinder conservation success. Assessing these relationships is particularly important for projects with both social and ecological objectives given that they likely operate through a more complex theory of change. Performance measurement studies that assess both ecological and social variables can offer an informative and cost-effective evaluation method for such projects, but simultaneous social-ecological evaluation is rarely implemented. Using the case study of the Marine Turtle Conservation Project in North Cyprus, we aimed to demonstrate how social-ecological performance measure protocols can aid sea turtle conservation efforts in adaptive management through informing on connections among project actions, outputs, and outcomes. Our study employed a mixed-methods performance measurement approach integrating three distinct data sources: 31 project publications, the project's long-term dataset on sea turtle ecology, and 26 semi-structured interviews with key informants including residents, fishermen, local business owners, and project staff. The results indicated that the project has generated a wide range of social, economic, and ecological outcomes. Two primary connections among social and ecological factors emerged: 1) bridging the research-implementation gap through directing research into policy action and 2) enhanced operational capacity and achievement of ecological outcomes through extensively engaging with the community and generating local economic benefits. Insufficient government enforcement and a lack of widespread behavioural change on turtle nesting beaches were primary barriers. This study highlights the benefits of multi-disciplinary conservation and demonstrates the insight that can be gained from rapid, social-ecological performance measurement approaches. Channelling such information back into conservation through adaptive management can serve to both increase the achievement of ecological goals and improve human wellbeing. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Land-use change is currently the main driver of biodiversity loss. Projections of land-use change are often used to estimate potential impacts on biodiversity of future pathways of human development. However, such analyses frequently neglect that species can persist in human-modified habitats. Our aim was to estimate changes in biodiversity, considering affinities for multiple habitats, for three different land-use scenarios. Two scenarios focused on more sustainable trajectories of land-use change, based on either technological improvements (Pathway A) or societal changes (Pathway B), and the third reflected the historical or business-as-usual trends (Pathway 0). Using Portugal as a case study, we produced spatially-explicit projections of land-use change based on these pathways, and then we assessed the resulting changes in bird species richness and composition projected to occur by 2050 in each of the scenarios. By 2050, alpha and gamma diversity were projected to decrease, relative to 2010, in Pathway 0 and increase in Pathways A and B. However, different pathways favored different species groups, and presented strong regional differences. In the technological improvement pathway, loss of extensive agricultural areas led to an increase in both natural and extensive forest areas. In this pathway, forest species increase at the expense of farmland species, while in the societal change pathway the reverse occurs, as extensive agricultural areas were projected to increase. We show that while multiple positive pathways (A and B) for biodiversity can be envisioned, they will lead to differential impacts on biodiversity depending on the transformational changes in place and the regional socio-economic context. Our results suggest that considering compositional aspects of biodiversity can be critical in choosing the appropriate regional land-use policies. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={Facing public concern over costs related to top-predator reintroductions and conservation, ecosystem services such as ecotourism are often used to evoke benefits that outweigh or offset those costs. Quantifying these benefits using rigorous scientific methods can provide confidence to policymakers and other stakeholders that predators can in fact deliver positive outcomes to people living alongside them. The evaluation of these benefits is often anecdotal or qualitative, however, and empirical quantifications are rare. In coastal marine ecosystems, sea otter reintroduction is seen as a conservation success to some but a bane to others. The contribution of sea otters (Enyhdra lutris) to tourism revenue is touted as a crucial ecosystem service benefit to offset the loss of shellfish harvesting and associated revenue, but remains unquantified, weakening the favourable reception of conservation action. The potential economic benefits of sea otters associated with tourism and the extent to which benefits are realized were evaluated based on: (i) choice-experiment surveys of tourists; and (ii) interviews with tourism operators in British Columbia. Sea otters were a strong factor in people's choices regarding wildlife viewing, and sea otters could have large benefits for local economies. Alongside socio-economic characteristics, tourism experience influences tourists’ preferences. Tourism operators did not perceive sea otters as strongly influencing tourist choice, highlighting the gap that can occur between the perception and the reality of tourist preferences, leading to missed opportunities for the alignment of economic development with conservation actions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Land-use change is a leading driver of biodiversity loss, especially in tropical fresh waters where the conversion of natural forest to monoculture plantations impacts freshwater fish assemblages. The environmental pathways underpinning shifts in fish assemblages, however, are poorly understood, but could potentially be inferred from trait–environment relationships. We addressed this knowledge gap using eco-morphological traits to explain fish occurrences in oil palm-impacted streams of the Endau drainage in Peninsular Malaysia. We also investigated how traits relate to differences in environmental conditions associated with land-use change. We then integrate findings from the above to test how potential pathways of land-use driven environmental changes can impact species occurrences through effects on life history, feeding habits, and mobility. Mixed-effects models show that fishes with superior (upward-facing) mouths and low body mass were more likely to occur in oil palm streams than forest streams, and these traits were associated with grass-dominated riparian zones and reduced woody debris in oil palm streams, respectively. Structural equation models show that mouth positions statistically mediated the effect of riparian vegetation on fish species occurrences in oil palm streams. Specifically, fishes with superior mouths were more likely to feed on terrestrial invertebrates. Our analysis of easily measurable traits revealed pathways of land-use impact that are potentially more widely applicable than conventional taxa-based approaches. Fishes with superior mouths tended to occur in oil palm streams as they were able to more effectively exploit inputs of terrestrial invertebrates that are potentially associated with grass-dominated riparian vegetation. Moreover, shifts in traits may suggest land-use driven changes in stream ecosystem functioning (e.g. in terms of the role of terrestrial subsidies), thereby informing targeted management actions in land-use impacted habitats (e.g. retention/restoration of riparian trees). © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

It is an example of the juxtaposition between species discovery and extinction: aquatic species richness is mostly unknown as no efforts have investigated aquatic communities so far, but are already anthropogenically stressed. We hypothesized that invasive species are already well established in various protected areas and investigated this by assessing the threat of invasive species that are already established within the SGBR on the native biodiversity. By combining field sampling with peer-reviewed literature and local reports, we identify the presence of various non-native species in SGBR. Among these non-native species identified were opportunistic predatory fish and potentially-pathogen transmitting molluscs, but also, a habitat engineer capable of modifying ecosystem functions. Moreover, we highlight that these species were introduced despite legislation and without any knowledge among authorities. As a result, we underline the necessity to describe native species, control invasive and prevent the introduction of further non-native species. If accelerated action is not taken, we risk losing a considerable amount of described and unknown freshwater biota. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={American bison (Bison bison) numbers in northern Yellowstone National Park increased during the last two decades, while those of elk (Cervus canadensis) decreased. We undertook this to study to assess the potential effects of bison on woody vegetation and channel morphology in the park's northern ungulate winter range. Based on differences in the number of elk and bison, body mass, and the amount of time each utilizes the northern range, foraging pressure from bison began to exceed that of elk in 2007 and is currently ~10 times greater than that of elk. In the Lamar Valley study area, stand structure data (i.e., tree frequency by diameter class) for aspen (Populus tremuloides) and cottonwood (P. spp.) indicated that the growth of seedling/sprouts of these species into tall saplings and trees has been extensively suppressed by bison herbivory. For streams that crossed the valley floor, woody riparian vegetation was absent along their banks and channels were relatively wide and deep, conditions sustained by high levels of bison use. Overall, our findings indicated that the elevated numbers of bison, via herbivory, trampling, and tree bark effects, are limiting the structure, composition, and distribution of woody plant communities in the Lamar Valley, affecting the character of the valley's stream and river channels, and, in turn, influencing habitat and food-web support for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife species. The conservation success of bison recovery now may be adversely affecting another conservation goal, the restoration and maintenance of woody riparian vegetation and riparian ecosystems. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={Epizootics and deliberate changes in policies affecting the environment may affect large groups of species and the functioning of entire ecosystems. Although these effects often overlap in time, their simultaneous effect is rarely examined despite their importance as causes of current biodiversity loss. Here, based on the monitoring of an Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) population over thirty-three years (1986–2018), we increase our knowledge about the effects of anthropogenic-induced changes in food availability, both direct (sanitary policies limiting livestock carcass disposal) and indirect (a wild rabbit epizootic), on brood size and body condition of fledglings at nests. We compared the body mass of fledglings of broods with one chick (Single) and two chicks (within which we distinguished First and Second-hatched). The mass of Second-hatched chicks decreased after the plummet in rabbit populations (in the year 1990) and the regulations limiting carcass disposal (2005), reaching minimum values during the period with lowest food availability (i.e. 2005–2013). Recent sanitary legislation allowing carcass disposal by farmers coincides with a slight recovery in the observed body masses. Overall, this study shows that environmental changes of disparate origin can have synergistic effects on individual condition. Conservation of endangered vultures will require multi-targeted conservation plans aimed at ensuring nutritional requirements, in addition to detailed long-term monitoring, in order to detect obscure/masked drivers that affect body condition of fledglings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={For Greater Scaup Aythya marila, classified as 'Vulnerable' on the European Red List of Birds, the south-western Baltic Sea is one of the most important wintering sites in Europe. In this area, a large concentration of gillnet fishery temporally overlaps periods of the most abundant occurrence of foraging diving birds. The aim of the article is to show how bycatch can impact the population of a diving duck. To assess this, we calculate the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) for the studied Greater Scaup population and we model the population change according to age-structured matrix models. Summing all the available recent figures on Greater Scaup bycatch in north-west Europe yields an estimated mean annual total of 3,991 individuals (2% of the flyway population). For a baseline stable population, an age-structured matrix model indicates that at this bycatch level the Greater Scaup population that winters in north-west Europe will decrease by 36% over the next 30 years, qualifying the status of the population as 'Vulnerable' according to IUCN criteria. As this population also experiences decline prior to bycatch, this decrease will be 57%, which qualifies the status as 'Endangered'. PBR as an indicator of population vitality does not work in our case because the PBR-informed allowable bycatch values have a significantly negative impact on the population. Our results indicate unambiguously that fishery bycatch is among the most important threats responsible for the Greater Scaup's decline. While recent data suggest that some improvement has taken place in the species' status over the last 10 years, measures to protect Greater Scaup from bycatch are required. The solution should involve the prohibition of gillnet fishing in selected key sites and the use of mitigation techniques in other areas. © BirdLife International, 2020.},

abstract={Agricultural expansion drives biodiversity loss globally, but impact assessments are biased towards recent time periods. This can lead to a gross underestimation of species declines in response to habitat loss, especially when species declines are gradual and occur over long time periods. Using Cold War spy satellite images (Corona), we show that a grassland keystone species, the bobak marmot (Marmota bobak), continues to respond to agricultural expansion that happened more than 50 years ago. Although burrow densities of the bobak marmot today are highest in croplands, densities declined most strongly in areas that were persistently used as croplands since the 1960s. This response to historical agricultural conversion spans roughly eight marmot generations and suggests the longest recorded response of a mammal species to agricultural expansion. We also found evidence for remarkable philopatry: nearly half of all burrows retained their exact location since the 1960s, and this was most pronounced in grasslands. Our results stress the need for farsighted decisions, because contemporary land management will affect biodiversity decades into the future. Finally, our work pioneers the use of Corona historical Cold War spy satellite imagery for ecology. This vastly underused global remote sensing resource provides a unique opportunity to expand the time horizon of broad-scale ecological studies. © 2020 The Authors.},

abstract={Population surveying and monitoring are important for identifying conservation needs and tracking trends in populations, communities, and ecosystems over time and laying the groundwork for conservation management and policy decisions. If species or populations go undetected because of inadequate effort or sampling design, protection and management cannot be properly provided. Due to the widespread loss of populations, the Eastern Massasauga (a rattlesnake) was recently listed as a federally threatened species in the United States; it is also listed as threatened in Canada. Given its current conservation status, there is considerable interest at state and federal levels in determining how to best survey for Eastern Massasaugas to aid in management decisions. Using a 16-year dataset, we examined the relationships among environmental, temporal, area, management, and search effort factors on the detection probability of Eastern Massasaugas. We found that four abiotic parameters (solar irradiance, shaded air temperature, three-day maximum air temperature, and humidity) and three search parameters (effort per researcher, search area, and search time of day) influenced detection of Eastern Massasaugas. As the current biodiversity crisis continues, the cost-effective use of resources and scientific expertise will continue to increase in importance. We hope our results stimulate similar analyses in other taxa, which will be critical for designing and implementing regional survey and monitoring programs. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Rapid biodiversity loss has prompted global action to prevent further declines, yet coordinated conservation action among nations remains elusive. As a result, species with ranges that span international borders—which include 53.8% of terrestrial birds, mammals and amphibians—are in increasing peril through uncoordinated management and artificial barriers to human movement, such as border fences. Transboundary conservation initiatives represent a unique opportunity to better protect species through coordinated management across national borders. Using metrics of governance, collaboration and human pressure, we provide an index of transboundary conservation feasibility to assess global opportunities and challenges for different nations. While the transboundary conservation potential of securing multinational threatened species varied substantially, there are distinct opportunities in South-East Asia, Northern Europe, North America and South America. But to successfully avert the loss of transboundary species, the global community must be prepared to invest in some regions facing greater implementation challenges, including the nations of Central Africa, where efforts may necessitate establishing rapid conservation interventions postconflict that align with local socio-cultural opportunities and constraints. Sanctioned and coordinated approaches towards managing transboundary species are now essential to prevent further declines of many endangered species, and global policy efforts must do more to produce and enact legitimate mechanisms for collaborative action in conservation. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Small-scale fisheries may pose a serious threat to the conservation of marine mammals. At the same time various factors have led to the decline of small-scale fisheries, often making them unsustainable. Current rates of biodiversity loss and the reduction of fish stocks and fisheries dictate a thorough understanding of fisheries-related issues and the implementation of effective management actions. The Mediterranean monk seal is one of the most endangered marine mammals on Earth; its survival in the eastern Mediterranean Sea is threatened by negative interactions with fisheries. A nationwide questionnaire survey among fishers and port police authorities was carried out in Greece to describe the main characteristics of small-scale fisheries, and to understand the nature and assess the magnitude of negative interactions between the monk seal and these fisheries. Questionnaire information was verified by a second round of interviews during landings. The main attributes of the fishers, their fishing boats, and their practices were characteristic of the small-scale fisheries sector. Overfishing was considered the main reason for fish-stock reduction, and negative interactions with marine mammals was considered the main issue for the fishing sector. Monk seals were present, caused damage, and got accidentally entangled in fishing gear throughout Greece. Damage to fishing gear was recorded mainly during spring and summer, and on average affected 21% of all fishing trips and 1% of nets deployed during a fishing trip. Based on these results, the implementation of general and specific nationwide fishery management and conservation actions are proposed. These actions are mainly aimed at improving fish stock status, changing the behaviour of the fishers, and mitigating seal–fishery interactions in Greece, while promoting the recovery of the Mediterranean monk seal in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={At the 18th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in August 2019, shortfin and longfin mako sharks were listed on Appendix II. This listing now requires CITES parties to issue import and export permits and to closely monitor international trade in mako products. In this paper, three core arguments are being revisited that were uttered against a listing of the mako shark: that it is not scientifically justifiable; that it will cause implementation problems and will have limited conservation success; and that regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) are better suited to manage mako sharks. It is concluded that while the mako is not yet endangered globally, the precautionary approach justifies its listing. At the same time, although there will in all likelihood be implementation problems, the overall effect of the listing will be positive. Lastly, given their limited scope and focus on utilisation of economically valuable species, RFMOs are not well-suited for the conservation of mako sharks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Several organizations run wildlife-gardening programs designed to mitigate the biodiversity loss and disconnect between humans and wildlife that commonly accompanies urbanization. The National Audubon Society runs the Plants for Birds and the Humminbirds at Home programs that, like others, recommend homeowners to establish diverse assemblages of native plants with supplemental feeders. Here, we use plant and hummingbird data from the Hummingbirds at Home program to determine whether common wildlife-gardening recommendations correlate with intended outcomes. Our results showed that, after statistically controlling for several variables related to observer effort and geography, the relative occurrence and relative frequency of hummingbird sightings during patch surveys was positively related to the (1) presence of hummingbird feeders in a patch, (2) number of nectar-provisioning flowering-plant taxa in a patch, (3) degree to which nectar-provisioning flowering-plants in a patch were endemic to the conterminous USA, and (4) lack of impervious surface (a common proxy for urban development) in the surrounding landscape. These results support previous studies that showed how recommendations from wildlife-gardening programs associate with intended outcomes, but do so across an exceptionally broad, national extent that varies enormously in physical and biological geography. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={Aim: Understanding where and why species diversity is geographically concentrated remains a challenge in biogeography and macroevolution. This is true for the Cerrado, the most biodiverse tropical savanna in the world, which has experienced profound biodiversity loss. Previous studies have focused on a single metric (species composition), neglecting the fact that ‘species’ within the biome are often composed of cryptic species. In order to identify biodiversity hotspots more robustly and across multiple dimensions we integrate functional, spatial and new phylogeographic data for the Cerrado lizard fauna by (a) mapping the spatial patterns of species and phylogenetic diversity; and (b) using endemism measures to identify areas of unique diversity. We then quantify the extent to which existing protected areas represent the diversity. Location: Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). Methods: We generated species distribution models using distribution records for all Cerrado lizard species. These, combined with mitochondrial DNA phylogenies and natural history data, allowed us to map species richness, phylogenetic and functional diversity and phylogenetic and weighted endemism. Phylogenetic endemism maps were then cross-referenced against protected areas to calculate the amount of evolutionary history preserved within these areas. Results: The central region of the Cerrado, a vast and climatically stable plateau, stands out as important under all biodiversity metrics. Including evolutionary relationships in biodiversity assessment, we detected four regional hotspots with high concentration of spatially restricted evolutionary diversity. Protected areas cover only 10% of the Cerrado area and hold 11.64% of the summed phylogenetic endemism of all lizards in the biome. Main Conclusions: We highlighted both stable (Chapada dos Veadeiros and Serra do Espinhaço plateaus) and environmentally heterogenous regions (Araguaia and Tocantins valleys) as hotspots of evolutionary diversity. The creation and/or manipulation of areas for conservation are essential for the conservation and survival of the rich and endemic lizard fauna of the Cerrado. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Population trends of the Blue Crane Anthropoides paradiseus were monitored by volunteers participating in Coordinated Avifaunal Roadcounts (CAR) in the Overberg and Swartland agricultural regions of the Western Cape province from 1993 and 1996, respectively, until 2019 in the Overberg and 2017 in the Swartland. The number of Blue Cranes in the Overberg increased from mean density of 47.3 to 204.7 birds 100 km−1 in the summer breeding season, and in the Swartland from 7.5 to 34.2 birds 100 km−1. In both regions, agriculture has resulted in extensive transformation of the original Renosterveld and Fynbos vegetation (Shaw 2003). Results show dramatic population increases in these two regions, following a major decline in populations in the Grassland biome (McCann 2000) where there has also been land transformation. Roadcounts conducted during the breeding season proved more effective in indicating population trends than those during the non-breeding season when birds aggregate in flocks. The survey results show what can be achieved by citizen scientists using a standardised method of monitoring. © 2020 NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract={Plants are one of the living elements of a landscape which have dynamic characteristics. In the green/vegetation concept, the diversity of plants becomes vital in landscape planning to articulate the ecological, socio-cultural, and economic aspects in effort to mitigate biodiversity loss. The aim of this study is to illustrate the application of the green concept when planning an agro-tourism landscape in Tampusu region, North Sulawesi, Indonesia which demonstrates the function and utilization of plants in landscape management while paying attention to plant diversity. Data collection was conducted by field surveys, interviews, and literature studies. Data collected and analyzed included the existing conditions of site, site history, planning goal, topography, flora and fauna, climate, existing facilities and utilities, and area management. Based on its function, the green concept in landscape planning in Tampusu agro-tourism grouped plant diversity into four functions, namely production, ecological, architectural, and aesthetic functions. The ecological aspect of plant species selection (both existing species and added species) was based on the consideration of the plant's function in the landscape with special consideration of its contribution to plant diversity and conservation including those considered as endemic species. There are architectural function for examples Goodyera celebica, Racemobambos celebica, Ficus minahassae, Pterospermum celebicum, Diospyros celebica; ecological function for examples F. minahassae, Clerodendrum minahassae, Vatica celebica, Myristica minahassae, Diospyros minahassae, Korthalsia celebica, Licuala celebica, Aquilaria beccariana, Kibatalia wigmanii, Lithocarpus celebica; production function for examples Musa celebica, Musa acuminafe; aesthetic function for examples C. minahassae, Ixora celebica, D. celebica, R. celebica, Phalaenopsis celebensis. This study demonstrates that the application of the green concept in landscape planning can help to translate plant diversity and conservation into management actions, especially in agro-tourism landscape. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

abstract={Umwelt theory is an expression of von Uexküll’s subjective biology and as such usually applied in analysis of individual animals, yet it is fundamentally relational and therefore also suitable for analysis of more complex wholes. Since the birth of the modern environmental movement in the 1960s, there has been growing scientific and political acknowledgement of there being a global environmental crisis, which today manifests itself as a climate change and biodiversity crisis. This calls for a multi-scale ecosemiotic approach to analysis of human ecology at various levels and scales. In this article I explore to what extent ecosemiotic methodology, drawing on Umwelt theory and its consistently subjective perspective, can be applied in analysis of human ecology at different geographical and ecological scales ranging from the global to the local. The article incorporates a case study of human–animal relations in Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve in the Central Amazon. This is a seasonal floodplain forest area surrounded by rivers. I investigate aspects of the living conditions and ecology of the reserve, with a main focus on indigenous communities and the circumstances of two primate species, namely the red howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus) and the black-headed squirrel monkey (Saimiri vanzolinii). I outline matrixes of levels of study in ecosemiotics, and scales in human ecology, and apply two scales to the Mamirauá case. These take an individual animal’s and an individual human being’s subjective experience as their respectively starting points. This allows for multi-scale studies of human ecology from complementary angles. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Restoration of peat swamp forest (PSF) on degraded Southeast Asian peatlands could reduce global carbon emissions and biodiversity loss. However, multiple ecological barriers are believed to hinder natural regeneration of native trees on degraded peatland and make restoration expensive. We evaluated if natural PSF regeneration occurs and what factors may influence it on eight different land use and land cover (LULC) classes with different types of disturbance, including drainage and fire, in a retired Acacia crassicarpa Benth. (Acacia) plantation landscape. The study involved 42 plots inside five PSF LULCs – intact, logged, burnt (1997, 2015), remnant and 212 plots at distances up to 2 km from the PSF edge in three Acacia plantation LULCs – unharvested, harvested, and burnt. The number of species per plot were similar between intact PSF (25 ± 6 (SD) per 20 m × 10 m plot), logged forest (30 ± 6) and 1997 burnt forest (30 ± 13) but lower in 2015 burnt forest (11 ± 10) and remnant forest (18 ± 11). Regeneration away from the PSF across all degraded LULCs varied from fern dominated areas with no regeneration to clusters with high stem densities. The plantation LULCs, unharvested (94 species) and harvested Acacia (71 species), had similar overall species diversity after 3–4 years of regeneration to the intact and logged PSF (90 species). In unharvested Acacia, total species diversity, species per plot and stem density decreased with distance from forest edge (1–300 m – 87 species; 9 ± 6 (SD) species per 20 m × 10 m plot; 1,056 stems/ha; 301–500 m – 33; 5 ± 2; 511 and >500 m – 38; 6 ± 3; 683). In harvested Acacia, there was low plot species diversity irrespective of distance from the forest (1–300 m – 51; 4 ± 2; 578; 301–500 m – 17; 4 ± 2; 1,100; >500 m – 48; 4 ± 2; 780). Factors which may influence regeneration differed between different LULCs, but there was a clear influence of distance from forest edge and dispersal mechanism – i.e. whether a tree was bird or mammal dispersed and the interaction between these two factors. While our study suggests that if not further disturbed by logging, drainage and/or fire, degraded PSF could regenerate naturally to a similar species diversity as intact PSF, the lower levels of natural regeneration further away from the forest may warrant selective planting of species which do not disperse over long distances. More study is needed on the factors facilitating natural regeneration, whether it leads to restoration of PSF ecosystem functioning and the role of Acacia as a potential regeneration catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Urban areas are expanding globally as a consequence of human population increases, with overall negative effects on biodiversity. To prevent the further loss of biodiversity, it is urgent to understand the mechanisms behind this loss to develop evidence-based sustainable solutions to preserve biodiversity in urban landscapes. The two extreme urban development types along a continuum, land-sparing (large, continuous green areas and high-density housing) and land-sharing (small, fragmented green areas and low-density housing) have been the recent focus of debates regarding the pattern of urban development. However, in this context, there is no information on the mechanisms behind the observed biodiversity changes. One of the main mechanisms proposed to explain urban biodiversity loss is the alteration of predator–prey interactions. Using ground-nesting birds as a model system and data from nine European cities, we experimentally tested the effects of these two extreme urban development types on artificial ground nest survival and whether nest survival correlates with the local abundance of ground-nesting birds and their nest predators. Nest survival (n = 554) was lower in land-sharing than in land-sparing urban areas. Nest survival decreased with increasing numbers of local predators (cats and corvids) and with nest visibility. Correspondingly, relative abundance of ground-nesting birds was greater in land-sparing than in land-sharing urban areas, though overall bird species richness was unaffected by the pattern of urban development. We provide the first evidence that predator–prey interactions differ between the two extreme urban development types. Changing interactions may explain the higher proportion of ground-nesting birds in land-sparing areas, and suggest a limitation of the land-sharing model. Nest predator control and the provision of more green-covered urban habitats may also improve conservation of sensitive birds in cities. Our findings provide information on how to further expand our cities without severe loss of urban-sensitive species and give support for land-sparing over land-sharing urban development. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract={Stakeholder support is vital for achieving conservation success, yet there are few reliable mechanisms to monitor stakeholder attitudes toward conservation. Approaches used to assess attitudes rarely account for bias arising from reporting error, which can lead to falsely reporting a positive attitude toward conservation (false-positive error) or not reporting a positive attitude when the respondent has a positive attitude toward conservation (false-negative error). Borrowing from developments in applied conservation science, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify stakeholder attitudes as the probability of having a positive attitude toward wildlife notionally (or in abstract terms) and at localized scales while accounting for reporting error. We compared estimates from our model, Likert scores, and naïve estimates (i.e., proportion of respondents reporting a positive attitude in at least 1 question that was only susceptible to false-negative error) with true stakeholder attitudes through simulations. We then applied the model in a survey of tea estate staff on their attitudes toward Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in the Kaziranga–Karbi Anglong landscape of northeast India. In simulations, Bayesian model estimates of stakeholder attitudes toward wildlife were less biased than naïve estimates or Likert scores. After accounting for reporting errors, we estimated the probability of having a positive attitude toward elephants notionally as 0.85 in the Kaziranga landscape, whereas the proportion of respondents who had positive attitudes toward elephants at a localized scale was 0.50. In comparison, without accounting for reporting errors, naïve estimates of proportions of respondents with positive attitudes toward elephants were 0.69 and 0.23 notionally and at local scales, respectively. False (positive and negative) reporting probabilities were consistently not 0 (0.22–0.68). Regular and reliable assessment of stakeholder attitudes–combined with inference on drivers of positive attitudes–can help assess the success of initiatives aimed at facilitating human behavioral change and inform conservation decision making. © 2019 Society for Conservation Biology},

abstract={The catastrophic loss of large-bodied mammals during the terminal Pleistocene likely led to cascading effects within communities. While the extinction of the top consumers probably expanded the resources available to survivors of all body sizes, little work has focused on the responses of the smallest mammals. Here, we use a detailed fossil record from the southwestern United States to examine the response of the hispid cotton rat Sigmodon hispidus to biodiversity loss and climatic change over the late Quaternary. In particular, we focus on changes in diet and body size. We characterize diet through carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope analysis of bone collagen in fossil jaws and body size through measurement of fossil teeth; the abundance of material allows us to examine population level responses at millennial scale for the past 16 ka. Sigmodon was not present at the cave during the full glacial, first appearing at ~16 ka after ice sheets were in retreat. It remained relatively rare until ~12 ka when warming temperatures allowed it to expand its species range northward. We find variation in both diet and body size of Sigmodon hispidus over time: the average body size of the population varied by ~20% (90–110 g) and mean δ13C and δ15N values ranged between −13.5 to −16.5‰ and 5.5 to 7.4‰ respectively. A state–space model suggested changes in mass were influenced by diet, maximum temperature and community structure, while the modest changes in diet were most influenced by community structure. Sigmodon maintained a fairly similar dietary niche over time despite contemporaneous changes in climate and herbivore community composition that followed the megafauna extinction. Broadly, our results suggest that small mammals may be as sensitive to shifts in local biotic interactions within their ecosystem as they are to changes in climate and large-scale biodiversity loss. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={China has over 1320 freshwater fish species, 877 of which are endemic. In recent decades, over-exploitation and landscape pressures have threatened them and led to a severe aquatic biodiversity crisis. In response, large-scale fishing bans have been promulgated to protect freshwater biodiversity in major Chinese rivers since the early 1980s. Here, we present the historical background and current challenges to the fishing bans. Implementing large-scale fishing bans may help improve China’s current freshwater biological resources and biodiversity to some extent. But implementing fishing bans alone is not sufficient to solve the crisis because of shortcomings of the current bans and expanding human pressures in most river basins. Thus, we recommend regulating other anthropogenic pressures, expanding duration and extent of current fishing regulations, establishing a comprehensive monitoring program, and initiating basin-scale ecological rehabilitation. These programs are also needed in other developing countries facing similar biodiversity crises and human pressures. © 2019, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Understanding the nature and extent of ecosystem boundaries has important implications for the management and conservation of biodiversity. However, characterizing and establishing such boundary limits has been a persistent challenge worldwide. The Cerrado–Amazonia transition (CAT) in Brazil is the world’s largest savanna-forest transition. However, the CAT is represented in official maps used by Brazilian governmental agencies as a simple line separating the two biomes. Here, we demonstrate that the CAT is in fact broad, complex and interdigitating and that its traditional linear representation is not adequate for recognizing and conserving biodiversity in this region. Over the 30 years of our analysis, the CAT suffered more deforestation than the forests and savannas in each individual biomes (Amazonia and Cerrado). The complexity of tropical savanna-forest boundaries has been misunderstood and misrepresented by current maps, severely threatening the complex CAT biota. As a consequence, vegetation losses have reached levels close to collapse in areas of intense human activity. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Urbanization is a major driver of local biodiversity losses, but the traits that determine whether species are able to tolerate urban environments remain poorly understood. Theory suggests that a larger brain should provide higher tolerance to urbanization by enhancing behavioral flexibility to cope with novel challenges. However, assembling empirical evidence for a link between brain size and tolerance to urbanization has proven to be difficult, perhaps because the effect of the brain interacts with life history to influence persistence in urban environments. Here, we provide a global-scale assessment of the role of brain size on urban tolerance, combining quantitative estimations of urban tolerance with detailed information on brain size, life history and ecology for 629 avian species across 27 cities. Our analysis confirms the expected positive association between brain size and urban tolerance, but shows that the relationship is more complex than previously shown. While a large relative brain size generally increases urban tolerance, species with small brains can still attain high success in urban environments if they spread the risk of reproduction across multiple events (i.e., have a low brood value). These alternative strategies, although uncommon in natural conditions, seem to be favored in urban environments, fundamentally restructuring the composition of urban communities. Thus, our results support the notion that brain size mediates tolerance to urbanization, but also shows that there are alternative ways of exploiting urban environments. Our findings reconcile previous conflicting results regarding the effect of brain size on urban tolerance, and provide the basis for improved predictions of the responses of organisms to increasing urbanization over the coming decades. © Copyright © 2020 Sayol, Sol and Pigot.},

abstract={Agricultural practices constitute both the greatest cause of biodiversity loss and the greatest opportunity for conservation1,2, given the shrinking scope of protected areas in many regions. Recent studies have documented the high levels of biodiversity—across many taxa and biomes—that agricultural landscapes can support over the short term1,3,4. However, little is known about the long-term effects of alternative agricultural practices on ecological communities4,5 Here we document changes in bird communities in intensive-agriculture, diversified-agriculture and natural-forest habitats in 4 regions of Costa Rica over a period of 18 years. Long-term directional shifts in bird communities were evident in intensive- and diversified-agricultural habitats, but were strongest in intensive-agricultural habitats, where the number of endemic and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List species fell over time. All major guilds, including those involved in pest control, pollination and seed dispersal, were affected. Bird communities in intensive-agricultural habitats proved more susceptible to changes in climate, with hotter and drier periods associated with greater changes in community composition in these settings. These findings demonstrate that diversified agriculture can help to alleviate the long-term loss of biodiversity outside natural protected areas1. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Biodiversity often stabilizes aggregate ecosystem properties (e.g. biomass) at small spatial scales. However, the importance of species diversity within communities and variation in species composition among communities (β-diversity) for stability at larger scales remains unclear. Using a continental-scale analysis of 1657 North American breeding-bird communities spanning 20-years and 35 ecoregions, we show local species diversity and β-diversity influence two components of regional stability: local stability (stability of bird biomass within sites) and spatial asynchrony (asynchronous fluctuations in biomass among sites). We found spatial asynchrony explained three times more variation in regional stability of bird biomass than did local stability. This result contrasts with studies at smaller spatial scales—typically plant metacommunities under 1 ha—that find local stability to be more important than spatial asynchrony. Moreover, spatial asynchrony of bird biomass increased with bird β-diversity and climate heterogeneity (temperature and precipitation), while local stability increased with species diversity. Our study reveals new insights into the scale-dependent processes regulating ecosystem stability, providing evidence that both local biodiversity loss and homogenization can destabilize ecosystem processes at biogeographic scales. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Loss of biodiversity is one of the major challenges of the anthropocene. Various indices are used to quantify biodiversity. For vertebrates, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) uses the Living Planet Index (LPI). It is calculated globally as well as separately for the species occurring in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine biomes. Action to prevent biodiversity loss can be taken by countries or provinces, so it is important to understand the changes in biodiversity at local scales. We present LPIs for vertebrates in Austria, both unweighted and weighted, according to species richness. Vertebrate populations seem to have declined strongly in Austria, and their abundance was stabilized at about 60% of the initial population size in the base year 1990-the LPI declined from 1 in 1990 to ~0.6 (unweighted) or ~0.7 (weighted) in 2015. This is almost double the global decline for the same period. LPIs were calculated separately for the terrestrial biome (~0.6), the freshwater biome (~0.9), birds (~0.7), and native species (~0.6). These indices give evidence that conservation measure to halt biodiversity loss in Austria is necessary and show where more data are needed. In Austria, more research is needed especially on populations of reptile species. © 2020 Katharina Semmelmayer et al.},

abstract={International trade has become a major threat to biodiversity in the telecoupled world. The literature on biodiversity loss mostly concentrates on wild species; however, the increasing loss of and demand for domesticated species are overlooked. Donkeys are decreasing in many countries because of economic development, urbanization, and increased demand for donkey hides in China. The donkey population in Africa has rapidly declined recently due to supplying China with donkey hides for the production of highly demanded and legalized traditional medicine, ejiao. As a result, some African countries, including Botswana, banned the export of donkey hides. Animal protection and media continuously reported threats over the extinction of donkeys and exacerbated rural livelihood in developing countries, however, limited literature has investigated the causes and effects of donkey-hide trade and its policy interventions. This paper applies the telecoupling framework and uses the data extracted from the media reports and FAO, to understand the scale and impacts of donkey-hide trade from Botswana to China. We also explore the challenges and opportunities of donkey-hide trade for Botswana, highlighting the mechanisms need to be established to regulate the donkey-hide trade, and also to harness available opportunities if the trade ban is lifted in the future. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={We assess the magnitude and the extent of recent change of significant human footprint within protected areas, key biodiversity areas and the habitat range of 308 lowland forest specialist birds in Sundaland, a global hotspot of biodiversity in Southeast Asia. Using the most recent human footprint dataset, we find that 70% of Sundaland has been heavily modified by humans. This represents a 55% increase in areas under intense human pressure since 1993. Areas under intense human pressure covered on average 50% of the extent of key biodiversity areas, 78% of each protected area and 38% of the range of lowland forest specialist birds. The results imply that the actual level of protection by protected areas is only one-third to half of that on paper once human footprint is accounted for. While all protected areas were impacted by human pressures, those managed strictly for biodiversity conservation presented the largest increases. These results highlight an exceptionally high human footprint across Sundaland and an impending further deepening of the biodiversity crisis across the region. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Biodiversity loss in tropical forests is rapidly increasing, which directly influence the biomass and productivity of an ecosystem. In situ methods for species diversity assessment and biomass in synergy with hyperspectral data can adeptly serve this purpose and hence adopted in this study. Quadrat sampling was carried out in Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), Gujarat, which was used to compute Shannon–Weiner Diversity Index (H′). Above ground biomass (AGB) was calculated measuring the Height and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) of different trees in the sampling plots. Four spectral indices, namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), and Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI) were derived from the EO-1 Hyperion Data. Spearman and Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between H′, AGB and spectral indices. The best fit model was developed by establishing a relationship between H′ and AGB. Fifteen models were developed by performing multiple linear regression analysis using all possible combinations of spectral indices and H′ and their validation was performed by relating observed H′ with model predicted H′. Pearson’s correlation relation showed that SIPI has the best relationship with the H′. Model 15 with a combination of NDVI, PRI and SIPI was determined as the best model for retrieving H′ based on its statistics performance and hence was used for generating species diversity map of the study area. Power model showed the best relationship between AGB and H′, which was used for the development of AGB map. © 2020, International Society for Tropical Ecology.},

abstract={Filling ecological and social data gaps for small-scale fisheries is crucial for global conservation of shark species. In 2016, international protection of vulnerable smooth hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna zygaena) resulted in a seasonal fishing ban to protect juvenile sharks in Peru's small-scale fisheries. Richer data on the fisheries' social-ecological dynamics are necessary to understand fishery impacts and the ban's efficacy. Semi-structured interviews with 88 Peruvian gillnetters revealed that fishers are cognizant of their impacts on the hammerhead population and further, that historical fishery impacts on the species are more severe than reflected in official records. On balance, respondents welcome conservation measures: 76% of respondents were in favor of the ban. However, most respondents also voiced objections to the ban, with unfairness emerging as a central theme including with regards to impracticality, economic severity, ecological necessity, and the burden of compliance. These objections may directly and indirectly stem from a lack of transparency and fisher participation in the ban development-and-implementation process. Fishers suggested alternative or additional options for hammerhead management, such as minimum sizes or dynamic “move-on” spatial closures. These results point to the benefits of a participatory process that engages fishers in practical and more equitable conservation solutions. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={We propose that the onset and progressive destructive action of cancer within an individual bears a profound and striking similarity to the onset and progressive human-engendered destruction of global ecosystems and the extinction of entire species. Cancer in the human body and our human role in planetary, especially biotic, degradation are uncannily similar systems. For starters, they are the only two known complex systems where a discrete component changes its normal ecological role and function—turning on and potentially killing its host, and in so doing, itself. Both are “hostile takeovers.” Clearly, humans are integral to both systems. With cancer we are the host and victims of the rogue behavior of what starts out as a normal, healthy, and functionally important part of our bodies. With the biodiversity crisis, we are the part of the system that has changed, expanded, and proven so destructive to the system in which we live. We argue that given that these threats to our bodies and Earth are both essentially ecological diseases, understanding the critical role of ecological interdependencies for avoiding both cancer’s and humankind’s destruction of their respective homes should hopefully promote better stewardship of both by the only animal capable of recognizing the problems—us. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={The increasing expansion of productive lands around the world during the last decades constitutes a strong driver of biodiversity loss, as they are usually established near to high diversity areas. Despite many studies that have compared bird diversity between natural and productive systems, a global synthesis is still missing and important for understanding how biodiversity is being altered. We conducted a meta-analysis based on 144 case studies to assess the effects of four types of plantations (forestry, oil palm, coffee, and cacao) on bird species richness and abundance. We examined those effects in function of plantation type, latitudinal zone (temperate or tropical), geographical context (mainland or island), zoogeographic zone, and biodiversity hotspots. Plantations presented negative effects on both bird species richness and abundance. Oil palm plantations showed more negative effects followed by forestry plantations, whereas coffee and cacao agroforestry plantations had no significant effects. Those effects were geographically variable, being more pronounced in islands and temperate zones, as well as at the Oriental, Palearctic, and Neotropical zoogeograghic regions, and at the Sundaland and Mediterranean Basin biodiversity hotspots. Our results showed that productive systems reduce both species richness and abundance of bird species, being insular species particularly susceptible. Exotic monocultures with low structural heterogeneity (e.g., oil palm plantations) derive in highly impoverished bird communities dominated by generalist species. We identified South East Asia, tropical South America, and the Mediterranean Basin as the most threatened regions because of the sensitivity of their bird communities and the increasing rates of native forest replacement. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The Annamite mountains of Viet Nam and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao) are an area of exceptional mammalian endemism but intensive poaching has defaunated much of the region, creating an extinction crisis for the endemic species. To make efficient use of limited conservation resources, it is imperative that conservation stakeholders obtain basic information about poorly known and threatened endemics. We present the first comprehensive information on the ecology, distribution and status of the little-known endemic Annamite striped rabbit Nesolagus timminsi. We used a systematic camera-trapping design to study the species in five areas in Viet Nam and Lao. In 29,180 camera-trap-nights we recorded 152 independent events at 36 of 266 stations. We obtained an additional 143 independent detections across 12 stations from a supplementary non-systematic survey. We analysed activity patterns and social behaviour. We also used single-species occupancy models to assess factors that influence occupancy at the landscape scale. We used N-mixture models to obtain local abundance estimates in one target area. The Annamite striped rabbit was found to be nocturnal and primarily solitary. Species occupancy was best explained by a proxy for past hunting pressure, with no significant relationships to current anthropogenic or environmental factors. Local abundance was 0.57 individuals per camera-trap station for one of our sites, and estimated to be zero at the other site where hunting appears to have been more intense. Our results provide information on priority areas for targeted anti-poaching efforts and give the first conservation baseline for the species. © Copyright Fauna & Flora International 2018.},

abstract={In the abyssal equatorial Pacific Ocean, most of the seafloor of the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCFZ), a 6 million km2 polymetallic nodule province, has been preempted for future mining. In light of the large environmental footprint that mining would leave and given the diversity and the vulnerability of the abyssal fauna, the International Seabed Authority has implemented a regional management plan that includes the creation of nine Areas of Particular Environmental Interest (APEIs) located at the periphery of the CCFZ. The scientific principles for the design of the APEIs were based on the best - albeit very limited - knowledge of the area. The fauna and habitats in the APEIs are unknown, as are species ranges and the extent of biodiversity across the CCFZ. As part of the Joint Programming Initiative Healthy and Productive Seas and Oceans (JPI Oceans) pilot action "Ecological aspects of deep-sea mining", the SO239 cruise provided data to improve species inventories, determine species ranges, identify the drivers of beta diversity patterns and assess the representativeness of an APEI. Four exploration contract areas and an APEI (APEI no. 3) were sampled along a gradient of sea surface primary productivity that spanned a distance of 1440 km in the eastern CCFZ. Between three and eight quantitative box cores (0.25m2; 0-10 cm) were sampled in each study area, resulting in a large collection of polychaetes that were morphologically and molecularly (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16S genes) analyzed. A total of 275 polychaete morphospecies were identified. Only one morphospecies was shared among all five study areas and 49% were singletons. The patterns in community structure and composition were mainly attributed to variations in organic carbon fluxes to the seafloor at the regional scale and nodule density at the local scale, thus supporting the main assumptions underlying the design of the APEIs. However, the APEI no. 3, which is located in an oligotrophic province and separated from the CCFZ by the Clarion Fracture Zone, showed the lowest densities, lowest diversity, and a very low and distant independent similarity in community composition compared to the contract areas, thus questioning the representativeness and the appropriateness of APEI no. 3 to meet its purpose of diversity preservation. Among the four exploration contracts, which belong to a mesotrophic province, the distance decay of similarity provided a species turnover of 0.04 species km-1, an average species range of 25 km and an extrapolated richness of up to 240 000 polychaete species in the CCFZ. By contrast, nonparametric estimators of diversity predict a regional richness of up to 498 species. Both estimates are biased by the high frequency of singletons in the dataset, which likely result from undersampling and merely reflect our level of uncertainty. The assessment of potential risks and scales of biodiversity loss due to nodule mining thus requires an appropriate inventory of species richness in the CCFZ. © Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={Although savannas are fire-adapted ecosystems, prescribing fire for biodiversity conservation remains controversial at least in some regions where savannas occur. Faced with uncertainty, many decision makers and even scientists are still reluctant to prescribe fire for conservation purposes in fire-prone ecosystems, invoking the precautionary principle. Knowledge gaps on the ideal fire regime, such as how and when to burn, and especially the fear of biodiversity losses, are among the main arguments against fire management applied to remnants of native savanna vegetation. To inform this debate, we assessed the impact of prescribed fires on diversity of plants (different growth forms), ants, frogs, lizards, birds, and small mammals, in savannas and grasslands of the Brazilian Cerrado. We assessed the existing species richness, composition, and abundance in areas subjected to long periods of fire suppression and compared to that observed over a short period after prescribed dry-season fires, within each group of plants and animals. Whenever possible, we carried out separate analyses for grassland and savanna. Burning did not significantly reduce species richness of any of the groups analyzed, but had a positive effect on richness of graminoids in grassland. When analyzed at the species level, abundance of most animal groups did not show consistent responses to fire, except for a decrease in some frog populations in grasslands. Forbs, graminoids, and subshrubs increased in abundance after fire in grassland areas, though in savanna areas, abundance of forbs, and subshrubs tended to decline after fire. Species composition changed little in response to fire as indicated by low levels of dissimilarity between burned and unburned areas. These results confirm the high resilience of Cerrado biota to fire, as expected for savanna ecosystems in general. Besides, we demonstrate here that the risk of biodiversity losses cannot justify the objections to the use of prescribed fire for conservation purposes in the Cerrado. © Copyright © 2020 Durigan, Pilon, Abreu, Hoffmann, Martins, Fiorillo, Antunes, Carmignotto, Maravalhas, Vieira and Vasconcelos.},

abstract={Forest fragmentation is a leading driver of biodiversity loss, yet its effects on positive species interactions remain poorly known. We examined the effects of fragmentation on mixed-species bird flocks in the Western Andes of Colombia. Using 500-m transect surveys (n = 14 transects), we sampled flocks in 8 fragments (range: 10-173 ha) and an unfragmented reference site within the same altitudinal band (1,900-2,200 m.a.s.l.) and matrix type (cattle pasture). We evaluated the relative contributions of 9 predictor variables, including patch size, distance from edge, and selective aspects of vegetation structure on the composition, size, species richness, functional diversity, and phylogenetic diversity of flocks. We found effects of both patch size and vegetation structure on flock species richness, size, and functional diversity, but no support for edge effects. Generally, flock richness and size responded differently to fragmentation than did functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics. Both flock size and richness increased with patch size, but this variable had no effect on functional and phylogenetic diversity. Flock richness and size increased in high-canopy forests with greater foliage height diversity, whereas unlogged, old-growth primary forests with large-diameter trees had lower flock richness and size, but significantly greater functional diversity. Phylogenetic diversity was not affected by patch size, edge effects, or vegetation structure. We found differences in flock composition in response to fragmentation. Richness of Furnariidae in flocks increased with increasing distance from edge and foliage height diversity, whereas that of Thraupidae and boreal migrant species increased in early successional and forest edge flocks, respectively. All flock diversity metrics differed significantly seasonally, with smaller, less diverse flocks observed in January-March than in June-August. Flocking behavior persisted in 10-ha fragments, likely because Andean flocks are "open membership"in nature, but there was extensive species turnover as forest edge and generalist species replaced forest-interior species in smaller fragments.

abstract={This essay explores the work Remembrance Day for Lost Species (RDLS), a coalition of artists, activists, and environmental organizations who memorialise the losses of extinction. I argue that RDLS's practices create an ethics of witnessing ecological loss in ways that expand discourses about what (and who) counts as grievable life. I take up Judith Butler's theorisation of the powers of mourning in rendering life legible to illuminate the ways RDLS mobilises grief and absence, thus reimagining relations between humans and nonhumans in a space outside of capital. RDLS participants unite on 30 November to bear witness to the extinction of species, habitats and cultures. The movement was founded in 2011 by UK-based performance collective Feral Theatre, artist Andreas Kornevall and Reverend Peter Owen Jones. Several other organizations and artists have since joined, though anyone may create participate, adding their events to the RDLS crowd-sourced electronic archive. I look at a particular event, the Lake Merritt Regenerative Memorial and Pollinator Procession (2017), to articulate the performance practices brought together under RDLS as a praxis of ethical witnessing in the time of climate crises. RDLS renders nonhumans as subjects through the creation of mourning rituals for extinct and endangered species. By approaching nonhumans through what Butler has called grievability, RDLS counters the human exceptionalism that supports the exploitation of nature as merely raw material for endless accumulation. By challenging this logic of accumulation, RDLS participates in a queering of normative capitalist time through the creation of a time-space outside of the inexorable forward movement of capital. As they engage in ‘nonproductive’ uses of time, RDLS resists the vast unmarked (biodiversity) loss intrinsic to global capitalism, bringing forth new forms of human and nonhuman relationality in the face of ecological breakdown. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Biodiversity is declining at unprecedented rates worldwide. Yet cascading effects of biodiversity loss on other taxa are largely unknown because baseline data are often unavailable. We document the collapse of a Neotropical snake community after the invasive fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis caused a chytridiomycosis epizootic leading to the catastrophic loss of amphibians, a food source for snakes. After mass mortality of amphibians, the snake community contained fewer species and was more homogeneous across the study site, with several species in poorer body condition, despite no other systematic changes in the environment. The demise of the snake community after amphibian loss demonstrates the repercussive and often unnoticed consequences of the biodiversity crisis and calls attention to the invisible declines of rare and data-deficient species. © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

abstract={The identification of factors that predict trends in population abundance is critical to formulate successful conservation strategies. Here, we explore population trends of Canadian vertebrates assessed as "at-risk" by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada and the threats affecting these trends using data from the Canadian Living Planet Index. We investigate how threat profiles-the combination of threats for a given species-vary among species and taxonomic groups. We then investigate threat profile as a predictor of temporal trends-both exclusively and in combination with additional biotic and abiotic factors. Species had 5.06 (±2.77) threats listed on average, and biological resource use (BRU) was the most frequently cited. Our analysis also revealed an association between taxonomic group and population trends, as measured by the proportion of annual increases (years with a positive interannual change). By contrast, the predictive power of threat profile was poor. This analysis yielded some useful insight for conservation action, particularly the prioritization of abating BRU. However, the predictive models were not as meaningful as originally anticipated. We provide recommendations on methodological improvements to advance the understanding of factors that predict trends in population abundance for prioritizing conservation action. © 2020 Facets.

abstract={One common approach to assigning conservation priorities during the current biodiversity crisis is to identify and direct efforts to high profile, vulnerable taxa, and important biodiversity areas. We addressed the first issue by assessing the comparison between conservation status and habitat suitability under differing climate change scenarios for sixteen species of five amphibian families (Pelobatidae, Bufonidae, Alytidae, Hylidae and Ranidae) distributed on both sides of the Gibraltar Strait, with the aim of verify whether potentially sensible species under climatic change scenarios are or not considered at risk presently in the IUCN current categories. We have addressed this with an environmental niche modelling algorithm (MaxEnt) and projecting the outputs in four future climatic change scenarios. Our results demonstrate that climatic niches of some species may currently match their conservation category, with Pelobates varaldii having the narrowest distribution and being the more endangered species, but not all responses to predicted climatic change scenarios are related to conservation status. Some suggest notable changes in potential climatic habitats, with both substantial increase (7 species) and decrease (5 species) represented. Threatened species such as P. varaldii could be climatically favored whereas currently more abundant species could maintain, increase, or reduce their habitat distribution. These results have implications for current conservation strategies, and suggest that this approach deserves consideration as part of any species or habitat conservation strategy in the future. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={India has the second largest population in the world and is characterized by a broad diversity in climate, topography, flora, fauna, land use, and socioeconomic conditions. To help ensure food security in the future, agricultural systems will have to respond to global change drivers such as population growth, changing dietary habits, and climate change. However, alterations of how food is produced in the future may conflict with other UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as the protection of land resources and climate change mitigation. It is crucial for decision-makers to understand potential trade-offs between these goals to find a balance of human needs and environmental impacts. In this paper, we analyze pathways of agricultural productivity, land use, and land-cover changes in India until 2030 and their impacts on terrestrial biodiversity and carbon storage. The results show that in order to meet future food production demands, agricultural lands are likely to expand, and existing farmlands need to be intensified. However, both processes will result in biodiversity losses. At the same time, the projections reveal carbon stock increases due to intensification processes and decreases due to conversions of natural land into agriculture. On balance, we find that carbon stocks increase with the scenarios of future agricultural productivity as modeled here. In conclusion, we regard further agricultural intensification as a crucial element to help ensure food security and to slow down the expansion of cropland and pasture. At the same time, policies are required to implement this intensification in a way that minimizes biodiversity losses. © 2020. The Authors.},

abstract={The late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA) was characterized by persistently low diversity of marine invertebrates following a second-order mass extinction. Here, we used a data set of North American (paleotropical) fossil occurrences of brachiopod, bivalve, and coral genera from the Paleobiology Database, combined with lithologic data from Macrostrat, to demonstrate that low diversity was caused by the collapse of carbonate environments during the LPIA. After dividing the data by lithology, low diversity was evident only in carbonate environments, whereas diversity within siliciclastic environments actually increased during the LPIA, after a brief decline in the Serpukhovian (late Mississippian). Diversity patterns closely matched respective changes in the volume of carbonate and siliciclastic rocks. The contrasting patterns observed in the two environments suggest that habitat loss was a direct cause of changes in diversity, because other factors, such as temperature, would have affected genera in both environments. A causal relationship is also supported by the finding that diversity remained high in carbonate refugia (carbonate beds within majority-siliciclastic formations) until the Bashkirian, postdating the onset of icehouse conditions by ∼8 m.y. Our results provide a unifying, mechanistic explanation for the distinctive characteristics of the biotic impact, including its disproportionate effect on the tropical marine invertebrate fauna, prolonged recovery from extinction, low macroevolutionary rates during the recovery interval, and regional differences in its expression. © 2019 Geological Society of America.},

abstract={Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) are an icon of conservation success, yet their status is inferred from total counts that cannot account for detection bias and double counts. With an effort of 4,797 km in 725 km2 of western Gir Protected Area, India, we used polygon search based spatially explicit capture recapture framework to estimate lion density. Using vibrissae patterns and permanent body marks we identified 67 lions from 368 lion sightings. We conducted distance sampling on 35 transects with an effort of 101.5 km to estimate spatial prey density using generalized additive modeling (GAM). Subsequently, we modeled lion spatial density with prey, habitat characteristics, anthropogenic factors and distance to baiting sites. Lion density (&gt;1-year-old lions) was estimated at 8.53 (SE 1.05) /100 km2 with lionesses having smaller movement parameter (σ = 2.55 km; SE 0.12) compared to males (σ = 5.32 km; SE 0.33). Detection corrected sex ratio (female:male lions) was 1.14 (SE 0.02). Chital (Axis axis) was the most abundant ungulate with a density of 63.29 (SE 10.14) as determined by conventional distance sampling (CDS) and 58.17 (SE 22.17)/km2 with density surface modeling (DSM), followed by sambar (Rusa unicolor) at 3.84 (SE 1.07) and 4.73 (SE 1.48)/km2 estimated by CDS and DSM respectively. Spatial lion density was best explained by proximity to baiting sites and flat valley habitat but not as much by prey density. We demonstrate a scientifically robust approach to estimate lion abundance, that due to its spatial context, can be useful for management of habitat and human-lion interface. We recommend this method for lion population assessment across their range. High lion densities in western Gir were correlated with baiting. The management practice of attracting lions for tourism can perturb natural lion densities, disrupt behavior, lion social dynamics and have detrimental effects on local prey densities. © 2020 Gogoi et al.

abstract={Biodiversity management and conservation planning are two techniques for reducing the rate of biodiversity loss, especially under the effect of climate change. Here 289 records of five species of amphibians from Iraq and seven environmental variables were used with MaxEnt to predict potential habitat suitability for each species under current and future conditions, using the 5th IPCC assessment (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for the year 2050). The models suggest that annual precipitation and the mean temperature of the wettest quarter are the main factors that shape the distributions of these species. The estimated current habitat suitability was closely similar to that for 2050 under both scenarios, with a high niche overlap between them for all species. Among species, there were low niche overlaps between the frogs Bufo viridis, Hyla savignyi and Rana ridibunda, and also between the salamanders Neurergus crocatus and Neurergus microspilotus. Future sampling should focus on areas not currently covered by records to reduce bias. The results are a vital first step in long-term conservation planning for these species. Via sharing these results with decision-makers and stakeholders a crucial conservation actions need to increase Iraqi Protected Areas to avoid losing biodiversity in Iraq especially the unique populations and threaten species. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

abstract={Coral reef biodiversity is rapidly decreasing as a result of the loss of coral cover, which modifies the structure and functioning of the ecosystem. Understanding how coral reef communities respond in space and over the long term is essential in order to implement management strategies and reduce the effects of biodiversity loss on coral reefs. Fish, coral, and algae communities were used as indicators to evaluate changes in coral reef systems. The variation of these communities was studied in a marine protected area composed of three management zones in Cozumel Coral Reef National Park in Quintana Roo, Mexico, over a period of 11 years (2004–2014). The following parameters were monitored annually: (i) total fish density; (ii) fish trophic group densities; (iii) species richness and three fish diversity indices; (iv) relative scleractinian coral cover; and (v) relative macroalgae cover. In the years in which coastal development, such as the construction of a marina, took place, an increase in the abundance of territorial herbivorous and planktivorous fish was observed. As the coral recovered, macrocarnivores and sessile benthic invertivores were re-established, whereas scraper herbivores showed no changes in the period of study in any of the three management zones. Coral cover recovery showed rapid phase-shift reversal (phase-shift, macroalgae dominance over coral) in the three zones. Even though the fish density and coral cover recovered, the diversity indices of each fish trophic group exhibited a reduction in the three management zones over time. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In the midst of only the 6th mass extinction in the Earth's history, we must rethink how we teach evolution to prevent natural selection from being incorrectly used as a biological justification for inaction in the face of today's human-caused mass extinction crisis. Pundits, policy makers, and the general public regularly identify the extinction of endangered species as natural selection at work, rather than attributing modern-day extinction to the sudden catastrophic bad luck of human caused environmental change, a phenomenon distinct from natural selection. In this natural selection framing, the inability of species to survive in human altered environments is the normal progression of “survival of the fittest” and conservation measures designed to protect species is human interference with natural selection. Paradoxically, this erroneous framing of extinction as the normal course of natural selection ignores humanity's exceptional role in causing today's mass extinction crisis. Our examination of this issue in U.S. college students indicates that it arises from misunderstanding the role of extinction in the history of life, leading us to recommend a greater teaching emphasis on the distinction between extinction and natural selection, and on past mass extinction events.

abstract={Coral reef ecosystems are at the forefront of biodiversity loss and climate change-mediated transformations. This is expected to have profound consequences for the functioning of these ecosystems. However, assessments of ecosystem function on reefs are often spatially limited, within biogeographic realms, or rely on presumed proxies such as traits. To address these shortcomings and assess the effects of biogeography and fish presence on the critical ecosystem function of macroalgal removal, we used assays of six algal genera across three reef habitats in two biogeographically distinct locations: Little Cayman in the Caribbean and Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Patterns of fish feeding and realised ecosystem function were strikingly similar between the two geographic locations, despite a threefold difference in the local diversity of nominally herbivorous fishes, a 2.4-fold difference in the diversity of fishes feeding and differences in the biogeographic history of the two locations. In both regions, a single species dominated the function: a surgeonfish, Naso unicornis, at the GBR location and, surprisingly, a triggerfish, Melichthys niger, at the Caribbean location. Both species, especially M. niger, were relatively rare, compared to other nominally herbivorous fishes, in censuses covering more than 14,000 m2 at each location. Our study provides novel insights into the critical function of macroalgal removal in hyperdiverse coral reef ecosystems, highlighting: (a) that function can transcend biogeographic, taxonomic and historical constraints; and (b) shortcomings in our assumptions regarding fish presence and realised ecosystem function on coral reefs. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Aim: Forest fragmentation is among the principal causes of global biodiversity loss, yet how it affects mutualistic interactions between plants and animals at large spatial scale is poorly understood. In particular, tropical forest regeneration depends on animal-mediated seed dispersal, but the seed-dispersing animals face rapid decline due to forest fragmentation and defaunation. Here, we assess how fragmentation influences the pairwise interactions between 407 seed disperser and 1,424 tree species in a highly fragmented biodiversity hotspot. Location: Atlantic Forest, South America. Methods: We predicted interaction networks in 912 sites covering the entire biome by combining verified interaction data with co-occurrence probabilities obtained from a spatially explicit joint species distribution model. We identified keystone seed dispersers by computing a species-specific keystone index and by selecting those species belonging to the top 5% quantile. Results: We show that forest fragmentation affects seed dispersal interactions negatively, and the decreased area of functionally connected forest, rather than increased edge effects, is the main driver behind the loss of interactions. Both the seed disperser availability for the local tree communities and in particular the proportion of interactions provided by keystone seed dispersers decline with increasing degree of fragmentation. Importantly, just 21 keystone species provided >40% of all interactions. The numbers of interactions provided by keystone and non-keystone species, however, were equally negatively affected by fragmentation, suggesting that seed dispersal interactions may not be rewired under strong fragmentation effects. Conclusions: We highlight the importance of understanding the fragmentation-induced compositional shifts in seed disperser communities as they may lead to lagged and multiplicative effects on tree communities. Our results illustrate the utility of model-based prediction of interaction networks as well as model-based identification of keystone species as a tool for prioritizing conservation efforts. Similar modelling approaches could be applied to other threatened ecosystems and interaction types globally. © 2019 The Authors. Diversity and Distributions published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={The pollution from urban effluents discharged into natural waters is a major cause of aquatic biodiversity loss. Ecotoxicological testing contributes significantly to understand the risk of exposure to the biota and to establish conservation policies. The objective of the current study was to assess the toxicity of a river highly influenced by urban effluents (Atuba River, Curitiba city, Southern Brazil) to the early stages of development in four South American native fish species, investigating the consequences at the population level through mathematical modelling. The species chosen were Salminus brasiliensis, Prochilodus lineatus, Rhamdia quelen, and Pseudoplatystoma corruscans, ecologically important species encompassing different conservation statuses and vulnerability. The embryos were exposed from 8 to 96 h post fertilization to the Atuba River water, collected downstream of the largest wastewater treatment plant in the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba, and their survival rates and deformities were registered. The species S. brasiliensis and P. lineatus presented the highest mortality rates, showing high sensitivity to the pollutants present in the water. According to the individual-based mathematical model, these species showed high vulnerability and risk of extinction under the tested experimental conditions, even when different sensitivity scenarios of juveniles and adults were considered. The other two species, R. quelen and P. corruscans, showed a more resistant condition to mortality, but also presented high frequency and severity of deformities. These results emphasize the importance of testing the sensitivity of different Brazilian native species for the conservation of biodiversity and the application of models to predict the effects of pollutants at the population level. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Biodiversity loss, partly due to intensification of agriculture, has become a global issue. In this context, fruit producers have been looking for nature-friendly production methods. By reducing intensive pesticide use and enhancing orchard management, they aim to create habitats suitable for beneficial organisms. Fruit production, especially in low-stem orchards, requires several interventions (plant protection, tillage, greenwork) throughout the year, each of them representing a disturbance. Thus, an expert system that evaluates and aggregates the impact of individual farming activities on a set of biodiversity indicators would be a valuable tool for developing new, less biodiversity-damaging scenarios. This expert system should be based on expert knowledge and scientific evidence. Surprisingly, our literature searches suggested that international journals contain few publications on the impact of most practices (except pesticide use) in orchards on biodiversity in general and beneficial organisms in particular. However, in the last decade, an increasing number of published articles have pointed out the rising importance of biodiversity in life cycle assessment. We therefore compiled and structured the available evidence to (1) assess the state of research on discrete biodiversity indicators and agricultural practices, (2) identify the literature relevant for assessing production impact and habitat suitability for supporting biodiversity and (3) provide a wide-ranging overview of existing evidence of the impact of agricultural practices in fruit orchards on biodiversity. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in scientific journals, agronomy magazines and across the internet in English, German and French. The main reviewer followed a step-by-step eligibility scheme that was validated by a Kappa test between two reviewers. Additionally, a third reviewer checked a subset of articles. We mapped a large range of parameters, which were structured in code sets. To compute a study validity assessment, we used 13 parameters that reflected the relevance of each article to the impact of agricultural practices in fruit orchards on biodiversity indicator species groups. Results: The search returned 947 included articles. The map identified major differences in the attention given to different indicators and practices over time, ranging from closely investigated (clusters) to neglected (gaps) - e.g. spiders and birds or amphibians and reptiles, respectively. The majority of studies were short-term surveys, mainly done in low-stem orchards. Main areas studied were Western Europe and Eastern North America. The resulting database is presented along with descriptive statistics of the distribution and abundance of evidence across time, interventions and outcomes. Conclusions: The current systematic map reveals that rigorous and comprehensive investigations on the suitability of orchards as perennial habitats for wildlife, run on the long-term and following a holistic approach, are still basically lacking. Although evidence base on orchard management effects on particular organisms has grown over the past two decades, information to develop reliable close-to-nature management tools and strategies is insufficient. The implications for policy and research suggest that - in view of worldwide biodiversity loss, which may cause a major threat for food production - a better understanding of the role played by orchards and their management in agricultural landscapes for biodiversity is required. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Land-use change is a major driver of biodiversity loss worldwide. Although biodiversity often shows a delayed response to land-use change, previous studies have typically focused on a narrow range of current landscape factors and have largely ignored the role of land-use history in shaping plant and animal communities and their functional characteristics. Here, we used a unique database of 220,000 land-use records to investigate how 20-y of land-use changes have affected functional diversity across multiple trophic groups (primary producers, mutualists, herbivores, invertebrate predators, and vertebrate predators) in 75 grassland fields with a broad range of land-use histories. The effects of land-use history on multitrophic trait diversity were as strong as other drivers known to impact biodiversity, e.g., grassland management and current landscape composition. The diversity of animal mobility and resourceacquisition traits was lower in landscapes where much of the land had been historically converted from grassland to crop. In contrast, functional biodiversity was higher in landscapes containing old permanent grasslands, most likely because they offer a stable and high-quality habitat refuge for species with low mobility and specialized feeding niches. Our study shows that grassland-to-crop conversion has long-lasting impacts on the functional biodiversity of agricultural ecosystems. Accordingly, land-use legacy effects must be considered in conservation programs aiming to protect agricultural biodiversity. In particular, the retention of permanent grassland sanctuaries within intensive landscapes may offset ecological debts. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Many large-bodied marine fishes that form spawning aggregations, such as the Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), have suffered regional overfishing due to exploitation during spawning. In response, marine resource managers in many locations have established marine protected areas or seasonal closures to recover these overfished stocks. The challenge in assessing management effectiveness lies largely in the development of accurate estimates to track stock size through time. For the past 15 y, the Cayman Islands government has taken a series of management actions aimed at recovering collapsed stocks of Nassau grouper. Importantly, the government also partnered with academic and nonprofit organizations to establish a research and monitoring program (Grouper Moon) aimed at documenting the impacts of conservation action. Here, we develop an integrated population model of 2 Cayman Nassau grouper stocks based on both diver-collected mark-resight observations and video censuses. Using both data types across multiple years, we fit parameters for a state-space model for population growth. We show that over the last 15 y the Nassau grouper population on Little Cayman has more than tripled in response to conservation efforts. Census data from Cayman Brac, while more sparse, show a similar pattern. These findings demonstrate that spatial and seasonal closures aimed at rebuilding aggregationbased fisheries can foster conservation success. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Ongoing and projected climate change is likely to greatly alter co-occurring stressor mechanisms, yet these potential interactions remain poorly understood in natural freshwater systems worldwide. As the global biodiversity crisis deepens, successful conservation efforts will hinge on developing mechanistic multiple stressor frameworks that have been ground-truthed in natural systems containing complex species dynamics and ecological processes. Our study examined the combined and interacting effects of potential climate and land use stressors on boreal stream fishes using data from over 300 catchments across a broad 250,000 km2 region. To characterize boreal fish community health, we examined four indicators including species richness, total catch per unit effort, the proportion of lithophilic spawners (fish sensitive to sedimentation), and the assemblage tolerance index which provides a measurement of the overall community tolerance to disturbance. Land use stressors included total anthropogenic land use area and linear disturbance at multiple watershed scales as well as two site-specific habitat degradation indicators (dissolved oxygen and the proportion of fine substrate). Overall community richness and productivity were not negatively related to land use changes indicating potential compensatory dynamics (e.g. where intolerant species are replaced with more tolerant species as habitat quality degrades). In contrast, we observed declines for sensitive species, including highly valued salmonids, that varied depending on interactions between local climate, land use, and stream type. Sensitive species declines were concentrated in regions experiencing increased land use and warming, whereas increases were observed in cooler regions consistent with a subsidy-stress response. In addition, lithophilic spawners declined in watersheds experiencing warmer and wetter conditions owing to potential indirect effects on spawning habitat quality. Results from our study provide novel insight into complex climate and land use interactions occurring across a broad, real-world landscape, and highlight the potential for amplified species declines under future warming and land use scenarios. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Conflicts between humans and wildlife could generate problems for biodiversity, and conflict management is important for avoiding biodiversity loss. Social acceptability of management actions for mitigating these conflicts can influence the success of wild carnivore management. Our study was carried out in southern Chile where we evaluated levels of social acceptability and consensus (using PCI2) for frightening, relocating, and lethal control in different scenarios for conflicts with pumas and foxes (native species), and feral dogs. Frightening or relocating wild carnivores were more socially acceptable than to not carry out any actions. In comparison to non-ranchers, ranchers were more likely to accept lethal control for feral dogs. Finally, ranchers were more accepting of lethal control for feral dogs rather than lethal control for native carnivores. We found that social group (ranchers or non-ranchers), type of encounter scenario, and carnivore type influenced the social acceptability of different management actions. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Rhinoceros poaching has been recognized the world over as a conservation crisis, the result of the high price of horn and demand in Asian markets. The commitment and participation of local people in conservation activities, however, are crucial for conservation success. Here we assess attitudes and perceptions towards rhino poaching and conservation in light of surveys in two local communities adjacent to the Hlane Royal National Park in eSwatini where perhaps 100 black (Diceros bicornis) and white (Ceratotherium simum) rhino occur. Our survey of 60 households addressed perceptions and attitudes towards rhino conservation and willingness to participate in rhino poaching and conservation activities. No efforts have been made to involve local people in conservation activities, and the people do not benefit from the park's activities. About 20% of respondents expressed their willingness to help rhino poachers provided they are paid for their services. Of the remaining 80%, some mentioned that they would not help poachers for fear of being apprehended. Still, some mentioned that they would not help poachers because of their concern about poaching and believe its prevention is important. Park authorities here and elsewhere could invest in building better people-park relationships, and provide opportunities for local communities to participate in conservation activities. Conservation policies to co-manage the resources could be used to deter poaching and to conserve wildlife involving local community members in monitoring and enforcement strategies. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

abstract={Amphibian decline is one of the most severe and well-documented examples of immediacy of the ongoing biodiversity crisis. In this study we analyze the scientific literature on amphibian declines with a view to identifying and analyzing emerging patterns within this large, and growing, body of knowledge. Focussing on peer-reviewed papers published between 1977 and 2018, we identified a total of 2,619 scientific publications, from the Scopus database. Using a visual-clustering approach, which allows us to investigate patterns and trends of research topics, we developed term-maps to identify how key terms cluster into research areas, and whether geographic patterns exist in the scientific literature on this subject. Overall, the average annual growth rate of the number of studies published on amphibian declines was 109.3%, with a decisive increase since 2001. The term map analysis revealed four main research areas: i) ecolo-gy; ii) causes and consequences of pollution; iii) global threats and extinction risk; and iv) pathogens (which includes many current publications, especially those focused on chytridiomycosis). We confirm the existence of a geographical research bias in the study of amphibian decline, with studies mainly located in western countries, which harbour a smaller number of threatened species. In contrast, studies on threatened species are consistently underrepresented. The literature on amphibian declines has increased at a greater rate than general amphibian literature, highlighting the pos-sibility that the observed amphibian decline has been a driver for amphibian research. © Firenze University Press.},

abstract={Conservation of elephants has become a challenging issue due to ever-increasing human-elephant conflict throughout its distribution range. The economic loss incurred by the farmers along with the manslaughter creating negativity towards elephants that leads to retaliatory killing of elephants. So, the conservation success depends on the mitigation measures of human-elephant conflict. All the high-tech methods are highly cost-effective as well as not at all effective under different landscape. Hence, the use of traditional methods along with the high-tech methods is globally suggested for mitigation of human-elephant conflict. Therefore, a study was conducted in the fringe villages of Rani-Garbhanga Reserved Forests of Assam, India to find out the traditional methods of conflict mitigation using both field survey (Night Stay) and questionnaire method during 2016-2019. The study found that the elephants were prevented by 12.2% from crop damage whereas for 46.5% the villagers were partially successful while another 41.3% completely failed to prevent elephant. The most commonly employed intervention methods were noise (100%) followed by beating drum (91%), use of fireball (65%), spotlight (24%), and firecracker (18%). However, when either was used in combination with noise their efficacy was compromised (interactions between noise and fire, noise and spotlight, noise and fences). Noise also works as an intervention technique, but only when used on its own. The study further suggested for use of modern technologies along with the traditional methods to take long-term measures to mitigate human-elephant conflict in this area. © TCRP Foundation 2020},

abstract={abstract – We are entering an era in which our planet and our society face major crises. We live simultaneously with three important emergencies: 1) the health crisis, intensified by the Covid-19 pandemic; 2) the biodiversity loss crisis; and 3) the climatic emergency. It should be noted that these crises have profound links between them, and also important differences, but they all have strong social and economic impacts and affect the planet globally. They are the result of an economic model that favors development at any cost and very quick profits even at the expense of sustainability. The Covid-19 crisis posed important questions from the viewpoint of a lack of global governance. In turn, the climate crisis has the potential for very serious socio-economic damage, and its effects are already clearly visible. The loss of biodiversity puts our food security at risk, and the balance of the terrestrial system as well. The Amazon, for example, harbors thousands of viruses in its fauna and flora, and if the unrestrained process of occupation continues, new viruses similar to Sars-CoV-2 will possibly come into contact with our society. Overcoming these three crises requires drastic changes in our economic system, unsustainable in its current format. Continued economic growth on a planet with finite natural resources is not possible. Inequality in developing countries and even between nations is explosive and unfair. We will need a new system of global governance that is able to harmonize measures from different countries, states and municipalities. Sustainability on our planet is possible and necessary. We – the scientific community, society, governments and other stakeholders –will have a lot of work ahead of us in the coming years. We have no alternative but to build a new, more just and sustainable society. © 2020},

abstract={Property theory is undergoing a revolution. For decades, theorists have envisioned rights as bilateral, focusing on intersections between directly adjacent landowners, or landowners and government actors. This over-simplified, two-dimensional model of property rights has resulted in laws that facilitate epic socio-ecological imbalances. In this paper, we apply the emergent theory of mismatched property rights to the problem of biodiversity loss. We observe that wildlife habitat for a single species can consist of tens of thousands of acres. Land parceling systems artificially divide wildlife habitat, fragmenting ownership of landscape-level resources. Managing large-scale habitats requires coordinating the interests of many property owners, often with divergent views on habitat management. Public lands’ landscape scale avoids this feature, but, nevertheless, still have competing resource users seeking to maximize allocation of natural resources rights. Wildlife habitat provides a particularly challenging variation on the theme of mismatched property rights. In this context, a primary stakeholder—wildlife—does not own property. We suggest that stakeholder collaborations are one understudied tool that functionally reincorporates wildlife resource uses into the existing property regime. Collaborations serve to re-scale resources so that they can be efficiently managed at their natural scale. Stakeholder collaborations cross administrative and property boundaries to create landscape-level management plans, which accommodates overlapping rights within differing boundaries. In this way, stakeholder collaborations appear to be playing a crucial, under-appreciated role in stemming biodiversity loss. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={The climate emergency and crisis of biodiversity loss show that the human–nature relationship is failing. This paper introduces the psychological construct of nature connectedness as a measurable target for improving the human–nature relationship, and therefore helping tackle the warming climate and loss of wildlife. The ‘pathways to nature connectedness’ (sensory contact, emotion, meaning, beauty and compassion) provide an important and flexible framework to help improve the human–nature relationship. Research evidence and practical examples are given from organisations using the pathways (e.g. National Trust, Wildlife Trusts, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust). This illustrates how the pathways provide a new methodological approach for improving human–nature relationships. A systems perspective is taken to consider wider application of the pathways framework. The societal relevance of the pathways approach is proposed, and the application of nature connectedness is considered across a range of leverage points relevant across multiple societal scales (from individuals to societies). Recommendations are given for specific pathways informed interventions to improve the human–nature relationship. These interventions focus on cultural programmes and urban design to increase sensory, meaningful and emotional engagement with nature. The interventions based on the pathways framework engage with leverage points around system goals, design, feedback and parameters across policy areas such as education, health, housing, arts, health and transport. Showing to read This shows that the pathways to nature connectedness have a large scale of societal relevance and the potential to provide solutions across a range of leverage points to foster closer human–nature relationships across society. © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Wildlife is one of the most important food resources in rural areas and popular among all social layers of Lao PDR. Numerous vertebrate species are sold at the local markets, but a comprehensive understanding of people's involvement and their impact on survival of local populations remains insufficient. This study provides the first interdisciplinary assessment using a questionnaire-based survey approach to investigate both markets and households in Khammouane Province in central Lao PDR. Data were recorded during the dry season (October and November 2017), as well as the rainy season (June and July 2018). We documented 66 traded species, mainly intended for consumption purposes, with more than half of them protected under either national law or international convention/red list. Furthermore, an evaluation of wildlife use from urban to the most accessible rural areas, indicated differences in affordability and trapping behavior. Our results suggest that wildlife availabilities can less and less satisfy the unchanged demands. © Copyright Katharina Kasper et al.

abstract={The historical accuracy of building taxonomies is improved when they are based on phylogenetic inference (i.e., the resultant classifications are less apt to misrepresent evolutionary history). In fact, taxonomies inferred from statistically significant diagnostic morphological characters in the absence of phylogenetic considerations, can contain non-monophyletic lineages. This is especially true at the species level where small amounts of gene flow may not preclude the evolution of localized adaptions in different geographic areas while underpinning the paraphyletic nature of each population with respect to the other. We illustrate this point by examining genetic and morphological variation among three putatively allopatric populations of the granite-dwelling Bent-Toed Gecko Cyrtodactylus aequalis from hilly regions in southeastern Myanmar. In the absence of molecular phylogenetic inference, a compelling argument for three morphologically diagnosable species could be marshaled. However, when basing the morphological analyses of geographic variation on a molecular phylogeny, there is a more compelling argument that only one species should be recognized. We are cognizant of the fact however, that when dealing with rare species or specimens for which no molecular data are possible, judicious morphological analyses are the only option-and the desired option given the current worldwide biodiversity crisis. © 2020 Brill Academic Publishers.

abstract={People’s attitudes towards the conservation of Australian wildlife is of particular importance as the types of attitudes people hold can have a significant impact on conservation solutions.We investigated attitudes held towards Australian wildlife and conservation solutions. A sample of 312 residents participated in an online questionnaire. An ‘ecoscientistic’ attitude was the most commonly held attitude, highlighting that wildlife are appreciated for the role they play within our ecosystem. There was a significant association between age and attitude towards Koala Phascolarctos cinereus and Crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster planci conservation and a significant association between socio-economic status and attitude towards Brush-turkey Alectura lathami conservation. Most participants agreed that action should be taken towards wildlife conservation in the future. Conservation managers and other key stakeholders need to capitalise on this information to increase public support for Australian wildlife, and encourage conservation action. Significant associations between attitude and some socio-demographic characteristics were observed, however more research between attitude and socio-demographic associations is recommended, including in other regions of Australia and internationally. © 2020 Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales.

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to explore the feasibility of implementing the natural inventory model (NIM) developed by Jones (1996, 2003) in biodiverse wildlife corridor plantations, from a non-government organisations’ (NGO) perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Undertaking the first cycle of an action research approach, the project involves collaboration with Greening Australia Tasmania (GAT). GAT is endeavouring to establish native wildlife corridors throughout the Tasmanian midlands, using science-based biodiverse plantations. The majority of the areas identified by GAT as essential for the establishment of these wildlife corridors are on privately owned land, primarily used for agricultural purposes. This paper explores whether stewardship of the land “sacrificed” by landowners may be demonstrated via the quantification and communication of improvements in biodiversity using the NIM. Findings: Results suggest that the existing NIM is impractical for use by an NGO with limited resources. However, with some adaptations incorporating science-based measurements, the NIM can be used to account for biodiverse wildlife corridor plantations. Practical implications: The findings have implications for not-for-profit, corporate and government sectors in terms of how accounting may facilitate the quantification and communication of conservation and restoration efforts. Social implications: Biodiversity loss is now considered to be a greater threat to the planet than climate change. Efforts to account for biodiversity are consistent with the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Australian Government’s “Biodiversity Conservation Strategy” (2010). Originality/value: While prior studies have successfully implemented the NIM using secondary data, this is the first known to test the feasibility of the model using primary data in collaboration with an NGO. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Contemporary societies are distancing themselves from nature, driven by urbani-zation, biodiversity loss, connection loss, industrialization and loss of green space access – all reducing our empathy for nature. Conservation and grassroots report-ing highlight nature’s wellbeing, and require impactful citizen-led responses. Youth leaders are reflecting mirrors on humankind, stating that ‘our world is on fire’ and demanding action. Natural world interactions provide health benefits and resilience, proving transformative to our attitude, values and behaviour. The My Naturewatch project facilitates engagements with people’s environments and, in doing so, helps them to comprehend them. Nature observations help connect, engage and foster custodians, at a time where separation from wildlife necessi-tates active engagement. Activities specifically challenge our understanding of ‘designed engagement(s)’, not as passive activities but as impactful active engage-ments, openly accessible. This article proposes criteria encouraging public partici-pation within the natural world, presenting value to NGOs, designers, funders and agents. Thirty experts from design, ecology, conservation, museology, engage-ment, rewilding, wildlife and community work were interviewed, informing‘design for environmental change through active engagement’.

abstract={South American cities have been expanding extremely fast and with reduced urban planning, which can lead to significant biodiversity loss. In this study, it was assessed the potential consequences of unplanned urban growth on bird species inhabiting an area comprising a mosaic of forest and natural grasslands in the city of Belo Horizonte in Brazil. Considering the lower aboveground biomass, it would be expected grassland patches to be more occupied by humans than forest patches. The bird community inhabiting the area in 2012 was recorded and it was also provided a visual interpretation of satellite imagery for 2012 and 2018. The urban area increased 192.73%, which occurred to the detriment of forest and, especially, grasslands, with a reduction of 10.78% and 22.12%, respectively. In this area, it was recorded a total of 126 bird species, of which 65% were classified as of open habitat. It was also discussed the need for better urban planning by incorporating potential impacts on biodiversity and preservation of habitat mosaics within urban landscapes. © 2020 Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ).},

abstract={Understanding relationships between animals and their habitat is a central goal in ecology with important implications for conservation. Misidentified habitat requirements can have serious repercussions because land protection or reintroductions might occur in less than optimal habitat. Studies of resource selection have greatly facilitated an understanding of ecological relationships but can be improved when vital yet infrequently utilized habitat features are more fully described. A critical element for many prey species is escape terrain or some other form of refuge to avoid predation. Mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) are well known for their use of cliffs to avoid predation, but a survey of the literature revealed at least twelve different approximations of goat escape terrain, ranging from &gt; 25◦ to &gt; 50◦ slopes. Here, we seek to (1) enhance estimates of mountain goat escape terrain and antipredator behavior, and (2) highlight the limitations of the assumption that the time an animal spends in an area is proportional to importance. To improve estimates of goat escape terrain, we conducted field work across two years (2014–15) in Glacier National Park, Montana USA and manipulated apparent predation risk by exposing mountain goats to a threatening simulated grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) treatment and a non-threatening ungulate (control) treatment. Mountain goats moved in response to the simulated bear but not in response to the simulated ungulate, with shorter latencies to move for subjects in larger groups and at shorter distances to the simulated threat. Through a used-unused resource selection function we tested 22 landscape variables to describe the use of escape terrain. Proximity to slopes greater than 60◦ best explained the locations to which mountain goats fled after exposure to the simulated bear, and the average slope of these escape locations was 56.5◦ (±14.1 S.D.). Our results suggest that mountain goat escape terrain be considered at slopes of 60◦ as a minimum because our simulated threat did not include pursuit of goats and, thus, slopes of 60◦ are likely underestimates of actual escape terrain. Additionally, because direct interactions between carnivores and goats seldom occur, serious escape terrain is infrequently used. Past estimates of escape may have miscalculated the slopes which goats select for in response to predation risk. Based on experimental approaches in the wild, we suggest that anti-predator behavior should be included in studies of resource selection when the goal is to consider habitat as a predictor for conservation success. Finally, we discuss evidence suggesting a past mountain goat introduction failed due to lack of adequate escape terrain and subsequent recolonization of a predator.

abstract={Wild boar are considered one the world's worst invasive species and linked to biodiversity loss, competition for resources, predation of native species, and habitat modifications. In this study, we use camera traps to evaluate whether the invasive wild boar had an effect on the medium-sized mammal community of a protected area in southern Brazil. Based on photographic records, we evaluated whether the presence and relative abundance of wild boar was associated with a decrease in diversity or change in activity of medium-sized mammals. All comparisons were made between samples where wild boar were present or absent. The records of each camera during a season were considered a sample. The wild boar was the fourth most common species in the study area being present in 7.8% of the photographic records. The species richness of mammals was not negatively affected by the occurrence of wild boar and most common species did not exhibit changes in the daily activity pattern. However, we recorded an increase in the time elapsed between an observation of wild boar and the record of the next species relative to the average latency period observed among other mammalian species. This average latency period was similar to that observed in the case of large predators such as Puma, and its increase could be reflective partly of the avoidance of native species to wild boar. Nevertheless, our results show that the effect of invasive wild boar on the mammal community is not large as expected.},

abstract={Summary . In the Amazon, the construction of hydroelectric dams is an emergent driver of biodiversity loss, creating numerous land-bridge islands, most of them unable to sustain an assemblage of bird species comparable to the intact forest. Although we understand the effects of forest fragmentation on species richness and distribution, we still need to uncover the physiological mechanisms underlying the success of organisms living in disturbed habitats. In this study, we used feather corticosterone levels as a measurement of physiological indicators of stress, evaluating whether corticosterone levels mirror the effects of habitat fragmentation on species occurrence. Since data suggest that smaller islands can reduce habitat suitability, increasing stress in birds that live within them, we predicted that birds living in smaller islands would present increased feather corticosterone levels. We captured birds in 13 islands of varying size and in two continuous forests and analysed feather corticosterone levels of 265 individuals from eight different species. Overall, our findings did not support the hypothesis that corticosterone varies in relation to island size, except for the Guianan Antwarbler Hypocnemis cantator, which presented the predicted pattern: decreasing feather corticosterone levels with increasing island size. These differences suggest that species respond differently to stressors driven by fragmentation. Further studies are necessary to assess the reliability of corticosterone levels as a physiological measurement of stress and to determine which parameters are useful to understand how insularisation caused by human activities may influence the resistance of avian populations to habitat disturbances. - Bicudo, T., Anciães, M., Arregui, L. & Gil, D.

abstract={Habitat fragmentation represents the single greatest conservation challenge of the 21st century. This problem is particularly acute for large, obligate carnivores like pumas Puma concolor which have persisted in North and South America in the face of habitat fragmentation and other anthropogenic disturbances. Shrinking habitat and reduced connectivity mean that mapping habitat is increasingly important for species conservation in multiple-use landscapes. Previous work suggests that pumas occupy habitats where sufficient stalking cover and preferred prey are present, yet the intersection of these factors has rarely been assessed. Here we used data from 68 299 camera trap nights collected from 181 sites throughout the San Francisco Bay Area over a four-year period to identify key predictors of habitat occupancy for pumas and their primary prey (mule deer Odocoileus hemionus). Our goal was to determine whether pumas occupy habitats based on relative measures of prey availability (detection frequency), or ease of predation (density of stalking cover) and whether these predictors changed between seasons. Our results indicated that pumas primarily occupied forested habitats and did not choose habitats with abundant deer. Instead, pumas preferentially occupy habitats that facilitate their stalk and ambush hunting strategy, rather than higher prey densities, per se. The best occupancy models for mule deer indicated the importance of roads and shrub cover. However, even the best deer models performed poorly compared to the puma models, likely due to the ubiquity of mule deer in the region. Although prey density is a widely accepted correlate of habitat quality for many carnivores, our results suggest that structural elements of habitat may be a more important variable in predicting habitat use by large stalk and ambush predators like pumas, which has important implications for conservation success. © 2020 The Authors.},

abstract={Research in ecology and wildlife biology remains crucial for increasing our knowledge and improving species management and conservation in the midst of the current biodiversity crisis. However, obtaining information on population status often involves invasive sampling of a certain number of individual animals. Marking and sampling practices include taking blood and tissue samples, toe-clipping of amphibians and rodents, or using implants and radio-Transmitters-techniques that can negatively affect the animal. Wildlife research may then result in a fundamental conflict between individual animal welfare and the welfare of the population or ecosystem, which could be significantly reduced if non-invasive research practices were more broadly implemented. Implementation of non-invasive methods could be guided by the so-called 3Rs principles for animal research (replace, reduce, refine), which were proposed by Russell and Burch 60 years ago and have become a part of many animal protection legislations worldwide. However, the process of incorporating the 3Rs principles into wildlife research has been unfortunately rather slow and their importance overlooked. In order to help alleviate this situation, here I provide an overview of the most common practices in wildlife research, discuss their potential impact on animal welfare, and present available non-invasive alternatives. © 2020 The Author.},

abstract={Protecting biodiversity, either for its own sake or for its value to humanity, is a principal goal of conservation efforts worldwide. For this reason, many studies on the social science of resource management and governance seek to quantify biodiversity outcomes. Here, we focus on the International Forestry Resources and Institutions program to demonstrate some of the challenges of quantitative biodiversity assessment and suggest ways to overcome them. One of this program’s research goals is to understand the causes of biodiversity loss, which is explicitly assessed using plot-based forest sampling. Plot-based methods to capture biodiversity changes require huge amounts of data. Even if sampling is sufficient, existing protocols can only capture changes in the types of species actually sampled, typically trees. Other elements of biodiversity are not censused, including animals, herbs, shrubs, fungi, and epiphytes that may provide medicine, food, wildlife habitat, trade items, or cultural goods. Using case studies of two sites in Uganda, we demonstrate that more spatially extensive surveys targeting multiple types of data can give a broader picture of forest status and changes than can plot-based sampling alone; many relevant variables can be observed while traveling among plot points with little additional effort. Reviewing the ecological literature, we identify correlates of forest status that can supplement plot-based sampling. These include large trees, epiphyte-laden trees, culturally or commercially valuable species, large stumps, and evidence of hunting and trapping. Further, data elicited from local resource users can play an important role in biodiversity monitoring. These findings suggest that effective biodiversity monitoring may be within easier reach than previously thought, although robust comparisons among sites remains a challenge, especially when climate, soils, or site history differ greatly. © 2020 by the author(s).},

abstract={While deforestation is one of the greatest drivers of biodiversity loss, our understanding of the effects of habitat modification on species is limited. We investigated the diet of a forest-dwelling frog species, Morafka's frog (Odorrana morafkai), in a highland forest in Vietnam in relation to habitat disturbance, sex and season. We surveyed the species at 45 sites in forest of varying disturbance and examined its diet using stomach flushing, estimating prey availability via trapping. We detected significantly fewer O. morafkai in highly disturbed habitats compared to moderately disturbed or non-disturbed habitats. We revealed that O. morafkai is a dietary generalist, identifying 28 prey types, primarily invertebrates. Prey composition, the number of prey items per stomach and prey volume per stomach did not vary between disturbance levels. Diet did not vary significantly between sexes, except that females had a higher prey volume. Prey composition in the species varied between seasons, with Coleoptera and Orthoptera dominating the diet in the rainy season and Lepidoptera in the dry season. The number of prey items per stomach and prey volume were significantly higher in the rainy season. There was a significant correlation between prey availability and diet composition. The low number of O. morafkai detected in highly disturbed habitats suggests that this habitat may not be optimal for the species, despite having a generalist feeding strategy and presumed high mobility. This study provides a window into the impact of an increasing threat, habitat disturbance, on forest-dependent amphibian species. © 2020 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.},

abstract={Road development in tropical forest landscapes is contentious. Local preferences are often subordinated to global economic and environmental concerns. Opportunities to seek solutions based on local context are rare. We examined local perspectives on road development within Cambodia’s Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary to explore opportunities for optimizing conservation and development outcomes. We conducted household surveys to document the perceived benefits and risks of road development. We found that in the sanctuary, road rehabilitation may accelerate transitions to intensified agriculture and diversified, off-farm incomes. All households prefer good roads and poorer households prioritize road development over other village infrastructure. Households perceive the most prominent benefit of roads to be access to hospital. Local government authorities are responsible for controlling land use and conversion within village boundaries and are therefore highly influential in determining the social and environmental outcomes of roads. Strategies to mitigate environmental risks of roads without constraining development benefits must focus on improving local capacity for decision-making and transparency. Local institutions in tropical forest landscapes must have greater control over development benefits if they are to reinvest assets to achieve conservation success. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={With the increase in wind turbines, bird collisions have developed as a potential hazard. In the federal state of Brandenburg, Germany, despite the on-going mitigation efforts of increasing the distances of wind turbines from the breeding areas of the more severely affected populations of red kites (Milvus milvus), the additional detrimental influences on the buzzard populations (Buteo buteo) have added to the challenges for wind power expansion. Using data on the regional distribution of the buzzards, along with their carcass detections around the wind turbines (WTs), we aimed to better understand their collision distribution patterns in relation to their habitat use patterns to predict their exposure to collision risk using boosted regression trees (BRTs). Additionally, we integrated the developed collision potential map with the regional density map of buzzards to identify areas of increased strike susceptibility in turbine installations. Our study showed that the buzzard collisions were primarily concentrated at the turbines situated at sensitive distances from the edges of watercourses (>1000 metres), as well as those along the edges of grasslands (>750 metres), in the green open areas around/areas with minimal settlements (750 metres-1750 metres), and along the edges of bushlands (>1500 metres), together explaining 58% of the variance in their collision distribution. Conclusively, our study is applicable to conservation because it demonstrates the identification of potential collision areas along with the causes of the collisions, in addition to demonstrating the benefits of incorporating a species collision dataset as a proxy for species presence into species distribution models to make informed management decisions to eventually combat biodiversity loss. © 2020 Bose et al.},

abstract={Individual responses of wild birds to fragmented habitat have rarely been studied, despite large-scale habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss resulting from widespread urbanisation. We investigated the spatial ecology of the Short-toed Treecreeper Certhia brachydactyla, a tiny, resident, woodland passerine that has recently colonised city parks at the northern extent of its range. High resolution spatiotemporal movements of this obligate tree-living species were determined using radio telemetry within the urbanized matrix of city parks in Copenhagen, Denmark. We identified regular edge crossing behaviour, novel in woodland birds. While low numbers of individuals precluded a comprehensive characterisation of home range for this population, we were able to describe a consistent behaviour which has consequences for our understanding of animal movement in urban ecosystems. We report that treecreepers move freely, and apparently do so regularly, between isolated habitat patches. This behaviour is a possible driver of the range expansion in this species and may contribute to rapid dispersal capabilities in certain avian species, including Short-toed Treecreepers, into northern Europe. Alternatively, these behaviours might be common and/or provide an adaptive advantage for birds utilising matrix habitats, for example within urban ecosystems. © 2020 Snell et al.

abstract={Declines in North American freshwater biodiversity can be largely attributed to anthropogenic disturbances that reduce habitat quantity, quality, and connectivity. In the Laurentian Great Lakes, wetlands have been significantly lost as a result of agricultural land-use practice, yet high species richness and several at-risk fishes persist. These patterns lead to the hypothesis that Great Lakes wetland fishes are in extinction debt, meaning there is a time lag between habitat loss and local extinction. To test this hypothesis, we sampled current species richness of wetland-specialist fishes in protected and unprotected wetlands in the Lake Erie basin. We predicted species richness in unprotected wetlands using parameter estimates (slope and intercept) from protected wetlands. Extinction debt was measured as a positive difference between predicted and observed species richness. We determined how much area would be required to support current species richness and compared this to minimum-area requirements for eight at-risk fishes. Species richness was significantly higher than predicted in unprotected wetlands, indicating that fishes in them are in extinction debt. This result indicates that there is time available to restore disturbed wetlands and prevent local extinction. We identified 17 wetlands of high priority for restoration (&gt;10 species bound for extinction) and determined that the restoration of 178 km2 of wetland habitat would reduce the risk of future biodiversity loss. This is the first direct study of extinction debt in freshwater fishes. Additional extinction-debt assessments in aquatic systems are needed to extend the ecological theory and fundamental application of extinction debt beyond terrestrial systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Habitat loss is widely acknowledged as a key driver of global biodiversity decline. However, whether biodiversity loss occurs in response to reductions in habitat amount versus reductions in connectivity in fragmented landscapes is debated. A challenge in resolving this issue is that measures of the amount of native woody vegetation cover and those calculated for structural connectivity are often highly correlated. Using multi-season detection-occupancy models we address the question: After accounting for the effects of native woody vegetation cover, what is the contribution of structural connectivity to site occupancy, site persistence and site colonization by birds? In this context, structural connectivity corresponded to the configuration of vegetation cover in the landscape surrounding our sites. We constructed multi-season detection-occupancy models for 44 individual bird species based on long-term field surveys in the temperate woodlands of eastern Australia. We found responses to vegetation amount were far more prevalent than responses to structural connectivity (35 vs 6 species). The range of responses by different species to vegetation amount, to structural connectivity, or to both, suggests that these elements have different effects on the processes of occupancy, persistence and colonization. The predominance of vegetation amount effects in our study, particularly the positive effects for a range of species of conservation concern, suggests the critical importance of both conserving existing areas of native vegetation cover and increasing the amount of that cover. At least for birds, efforts to physically connect particular patches may have relatively less benefit compared to programs to boost overall vegetation cover. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Monocultural rubber plantations have replaced tropical forest, causing biodiversity loss. While protecting intact or semi-intact biodiverse forest is paramount, improving biodiversity value within the 11.4 million hectares of existing rubber plantations could offer important conservation benefits, if yields are also maintained. Some farmers practice agroforestry with high-yielding clonal rubber varieties to increase and diversify incomes. Here, we ask whether such rubber agroforestry improves biodiversity value or affects rubber yields relative to monoculture. We surveyed birds, fruit-feeding butterflies and reptiles in 25 monocultural and 39 agroforest smallholder rubber plots in Thailand, the world's biggest rubber producer. Management and vegetation structure data were collected from each plot, and landscape composition around plots was quantified. Rubber yield data were collected for a separate set of 34 monocultural and 47 agroforest rubber plots in the same region. Reported rubber yields did not differ between agroforests and monocultures, meaning adoption of agroforestry in this context should not increase land demand for natural rubber. Butterfly richness was greater in agroforests, where richness increased with greater natural forest extent in the landscape. Bird and reptile richness were similar between agroforests and monocultures, but bird richness increased with the height of herbaceous vegetation inside rubber plots. Species composition of butterflies differed between agroforests and monocultures, and in response to natural forest extent, while bird composition was influenced by herbaceous vegetation height within plots, the density of non-rubber trees within plots (representing agroforestry complexity) and natural forest extent in the landscape. Reptile composition was influenced by canopy cover and open habitat extent in the landscape. Conservation priority and forest-dependent birds were not supported within rubber. Synthesis and applications. Rubber agroforestry using clonal varieties provides modest biodiversity benefits relative to monocultures, without compromising yields. Agroforests may also generate ecosystem service and livelihood benefits. Management of monocultural rubber production to increase inter-row vegetation height and complexity may further benefit biodiversity. However, biodiversity losses from encroachment of rubber onto forests will not be offset by rubber agroforestry or rubber plot management. This evidence is important for developing guidelines around biodiversity-friendly rubber and sustainable supply chains, and for farmers interested in diversifying rubber production. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Studies assessing online public sentiment towards biodiversity conservation are almost non-existent. The use of social media data and other online data sources is increasing in conservation science. We collected social media and online news data pertaining to rhinoceros, which are iconic species especially threatened by illegal wildlife trade, and assessed online sentiment towards these species using natural language processing methods. We also used an outlier detection technique to identify the most prominent conservation-related events imprinted into this data. We found that tragic events, such as the death of the last male northern white rhinoceros, Sudan, in March 2018, triggered the strongest reactions, which appeared to be concentrated in western countries, outside rhinoceros range states. We also found a strong temporal cross-correlation between social media data volume and online news volume in relation to tragic events, while other events only appeared in either social media or online news. Our results highlight that the public is concerned about biodiversity loss and this, in turn, can be used to increase pressure on decision makers to develop adequate conservation actions that can help reverse the biodiversity crisis. The proposed methods and analyses can be used to infer sentiment towards any biodiversity topic from digital media data, and to detect which events are perceived most important to the public. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In 2015 Cecil the lion's death sparked international furore over the practice of lion trophy hunting. Celebrities and everyday citizens, traditional news and social media alike were aflame around the globe, most notably after American celebrity Jimmy Kimmel expressed disgust in Cecil's death during a monologue on his late-night talk show. This paper explores the Cecil Moment as a case study of the cultural politics of the environment at the intersection of celebrity environmentalism and ‘Nature 2.0’ applications like Facebook and Twitter. The research asks: what can the Cecil Moment can tell us about how celebrity and Nature 2.0 environmentalisms work and to what kind of conservation politics do they lead? Drawing on the celebrity environmentalism and Nature 2.0 literatures, I develop an analytic framework for analyzing the Cecil Moment which considers and evaluates the network of actors enrolled, the representations foregrounded and backgrounded, as well as the outcomes. Empirical insights are drawn from document and media review, and key informant interviews. I argue that the Cecil Moment operated through a more-than-human network which served to channel agency unleashed by Cecil's death to the already-empowered lion conservation actors, as well as mutable meanings that shifted Cecil Moment focus away from trophy hunting and toward lion conservation in general. Ultimately, the Cecil Moment operated to dismiss the anti-trophy hunting politics that sparked and fuelled it in the first place; yet, the momentum of the Cecil Moment was grasped and re-directed toward other lion conservation priorities. Critically, this re-direction was not neutral; rather, it shifted the politics of the Cecil Moment in a way that reproduced longstanding patterns of conservation injustice wherein blame for biodiversity loss is directed away from powerful forces onto the racialized, rural poor from the Global South. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A key challenge in conservation biology is that not all species are equally likely to go extinct when faced with a disturbance, but there are multiple overlapping reasons for such differences in extinction probability. Differences in species extinction risk may represent extinction selectivity, a non-random process by which species’ risks of extinction are caused by differences in fitness based on traits. Additionally, rare species with low abundances and/or occupancies are more likely to go extinct than common species for reasons of random chance alone, that is, bad luck. Unless ecologists and conservation biologists can disentangle random and selective extinction processes, then the prediction and prevention of future extinctions will continue to be an elusive challenge. We suggest that a modified version of a common null model procedure, rarefaction, can be used to disentangle the influence of stochastic species loss from selective non-random processes. To this end we applied a rarefaction-based null model to three published data sets to characterize the influence of species rarity in driving biodiversity loss following three biodiversity loss events: (a) disease-associated bat declines; (b) disease-associated amphibian declines; and (c) habitat loss and invasive species-associated gastropod declines. For each case study, we used rarefaction to generate null expectations of biodiversity loss and species-specific extinction probabilities. In each of our case studies, we find evidence for both random and non-random (selective) extinctions. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly considering that some species extinctions are the result of stochastic processes. In other words, we find significant evidence for bad luck in the extinction process. Policy implications. Our results suggest that rarefaction can be used to disentangle random and non-random extinctions and guide management decisions. For example, rarefaction can be used retrospectively to identify when declines of at-risk species are likely to result from selectivity, versus random chance. Rarefaction can also be used prospectively to formulate minimum predictions of species loss in response to hypothetical disturbances. Given its minimal data requirements and familiarity among ecologists, rarefaction may be an efficient and versatile tool for identifying and protecting species that are most vulnerable to global extinction. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={We investigate how variation in patch area and forest cover quantified for three different spatial scales (buffer size of 500, 1500 and 3000 m radius) affects species richness and functional diversity of bat assemblages in two ecosystems differing in fragment–matrix contrast: a landbridge island system in Panama and a countryside ecosystem in the Brazilian Amazon. Bats were sampled on 11 islands and the adjacent mainland in Panama, and in eight forest fragments and nearby continuous forest in Brazil. Species–area relationships (SAR) were assessed based on Chao1 species richness estimates, and functional diversity–area relationships (FAR) were quantified using Chao1 functional diversity estimates measured as the total branch length of a trait dendrogram. FARs were calculated using three trait sets: considering five species functional traits (FARALL), and trait subsets reflecting ‘diet breadth’ (FARDIET) and ‘dispersal ability’ (FARDISPERSAL). We found that in both study systems, FARALL was less sensitive to habitat loss than SAR, in the sense that an equal reduction in habitat loss led to a disproportionately smaller loss of functional diversity compared to species richness. However, the inhospitable and static aquatic matrix in the island ecosystem resulted in more pronounced species loss with increasing loss of habitat compared to the countryside ecosystem. Moreover, while we found a significant FARDISPERSAL for the island ecosystem in relation to forest cover within 500 m landscape buffers, FARDIET and FARDISPERSAL were not significant for the countryside ecosystem. Our findings highlight that species richness and functional diversity in island and countryside ecosystems scale fundamentally differently with habitat loss, and suggest that key bat ecological functions, such as pollination, seed dispersal and arthropod suppression, may be maintained in fragments despite a reduction in species richness. Our study reinforces the importance of increasing habitat availability for decreasing the chances of losing species richness in smaller fragments. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Human-induced land use changes like agriculture and urban development occur commonly at the cost of natural wetlands, which require immediate attention and sustained efforts from urban planners and concerned governments. In view of the East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW), India, this paper has examined the trend, causes, extent and impacts of landscape transformation during the last few decades. Hence we aim to present a review of several studies in and around EKW and suggests a sustainable model for EKW. This ‘Ramsar site of International Importance’ is one of the world's largest wastewater-fed aquaculture systems where the city sewage is recycled for pisciculture and agriculture, and acts as flood resistance for the city of Kolkata. Rapid encroachment in the EKW due to unplanned development has caused various environmental, social and economic impacts. The key ecological impacts found in the study included loss of faunal and floral diversity, eco-toxicological impacts, etc. In terms of biodiversity loss, while the number of bird species in the EKW decreased from 248 in 1960s to 72 in 2005, about 59% fish species are near threats, vulnerable and endangered. Reported persistent organic pollutants (POPs) around the EKW region were found to pose deleterious impact on environment and ambient biota. Several studies have evidenced that the open burning of solid waste in the dumping ground of Dhapa is a potential source of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo dioxin/furans (PCDD/Fs). Further the ecological transformation of the EKW focussing on policy development and regulatory compliance issues has been studied in this paper. The aspects of encroachment and wetland shrinkage triggered by economic drivers like urban sprawl have been analyzed. The paper presents adaptive co-management as the future roadmap for action to curb further degradation of the wetlands, and adopt an integrated approach of environmental, political, physical, economic and institutional aspects. It is envisaged that the adaptive co-management model will contribute to long-term sustainable sustenance of this precious ecosystem. © 2019},

abstract={Hypancistrus zebra is a catfish, endemic from the Xingu River, threatened with extinction due to the impacts of Belo Monte dam, of its illegal capture, of gold mining activities and of climate change. Currently, there are three nucleotide sequences from this species in GenBank, what impedes the development of genetic markers to assist on its conservation. A total of 217 million RNA-Seq reads from seven organs were sequenced and used to assemble 566,607 transcripts, including 98% of BUSCO vertebrates orthologs, 11,321 transcripts with SNVs and 1,724 transcripts with indels. Three transcripts with SNVs and five transcripts with indels were validated as the best candidate markers to conservation practices. This work illustrates the use of transcriptomics in conservation, by the development of a bigger toolbox for an endangered fish, and shall further contribute to studies on this and others related species reproduction, physiology, and adaptability to environmental changes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Successive policy agendas in Nepal have mobilised the notion of the natural environment through crisis scenarios of deforestation and soil erosion, biodiversity loss, and latterly climate change. This article discusses ethnographic work on struggles over livelihoods and national park regulations, and examines collisions and collusions of indigenous shamanic ontologies, moral ecologies, and a hierarchical state symbolism of hunting, to tell very different storylines about languages of nature slipping into affinity with communicative orders of hierarchical purity and power distinctions. Protected areas for nature and wildlife are established in ethnically marked territories, perceived by elites as places of jangal, lacking in culture. Ethnographic research in the Langtang National Park reveals that no singular hegemonic order or ontology dominates but dialogues of power, knowledge, and relational possibility come into play. The aftermath of 2015s earthquakes notably occasioned appeals for social justice to bend the singularly proprietorial resource language of nature protection authorities. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Studies on threatened species in highly modified and unprotected landscapes are necessary for the development of appropriate conservation policies. This is particularly important for species with large home ranges, such as the giant armadillo Priodontes maximus, whose occurrence in anthropogenic landscapes is poorly known despite its categorization as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. We searched and surveyed for the giant armadillo within human-modified areas in central Brazil using direct and indirect methods across a wide region dominated by diverse farming environments and scattered remnants of natural vegetation. During a 14-year period (2003-2016, we located 54 records of the species, including three road-kills and two instances of poaching. Most of the occurrence points (83%) were in native vegetation, with 17% in anthropogenic environments (pastures and roads). We confirmed the presence of the giant armadillo within a wide, intensely humanaltered region. These findings indicate that Cerrado and Atlantic Forest remnants in modified landscapes in central Brazil play an important role as refuges for this armadillo species. In addition to habitat loss, road-kills and poaching persist as threats to the giant armadillo. Conservation actions are necessary to minimize human impacts and facilitate the persistence of the giant armadillo in this region. Policies that both deter illegal deforestation and strengthen incentives for the protection of natural vegetation remnants and restoration of biological corridors such as gallery forests would aid conservation of the giant armadillo in this area. © 2018 Fauna and Flora International.},
