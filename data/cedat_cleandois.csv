REINTRODUCTION EFFORTS FROM CAPTIVE ASSURANCE COLONIES ARE UNLIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS TO CONTROL CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS IN THE WILD. IN AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP A PROTECTIVE TREATMENT REGIMEN, WE TREATED GOLDEN FROGS WITH JANTHINOBACTERIUM LIVIDUM, A SKIN BACTERIUM THAT HAS BEEN USED TO EXPERIMENTALLY PREVENT CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS IN NORTH AMERICAN AMPHIBIANS. ALTHOUGH J. LIVIDUM APPEARED TO COLONIZE A. ZETEKI SKIN TEMPORARILY, IT DID NOT PREVENT OR DELAY MORTALITY IN A.

VOLUNTEERS CAN HELP TO COLLECT INFORMATION OVER LARGE SCALES, BUT THEIR DATA MAY BE AFFECTED BY HETEROGENEITY FOR SAMPLING EFFORTS AND PROTOCOLS, WHICH MAY INFLUENCE DETECTION PROBABILITY. IGNORING THIS ISSUE MAY CONDUCT TO MISLEADING CONCLUSIONS. HERE WE SHOW THAT DATA COLLECTED BY DIFFERENT VOLUNTEER GROUPS CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH MEASURES OF SAMPLING EFFORTS, TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON LARGE SCALE DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS. WE COLLECTED DATA ON 33 COMMON TOAD (BUFO BUFO) POPULATIONS ACROSS ITALY FOR THE PERIOD 1993-2010. WE USED TWO APPROACHES (META-ANALYSIS; ANALYSIS OF AVERAGE CHANGE IN POPULATION SIZE) TO EVALUATE THE OVERALL DEMOGRAPHIC TREND. WE INCORPORATED MEASURES OF VOLUNTEER SAMPLING EFFORTS INTO ANALYSES, TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CHANGES IN DETECTION PROBABILITY. TOAD ABUNDANCE SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED IN THE LAST DECADE. FROM 2000 TO 2010, 70\% OF POPULATIONS SHOWED A STRONG DECLINE, AND ONLY 10\% INCREASED. TRENDS WERE HETEROGENEOUS AMONG POPULATIONS, BUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SAMPLING EFFORT REDUCED HETEROGENEITY BY 40\%. WE DETECTED A 76\% CUMULATIVE AVERAGE DECLINE OF TOAD POPULATIONS, DESPITE AN INCREASING MEAN SAMPLING EFFORT. THE WIDESPREAD TOAD DECLINE RISES CONCERN FOR ITS FUTURE, ALSO BECAUSE THE CAUSES REMAIN UNCLEAR.

ANURAN OBSERVATIONS WERE CONDUCTED USING NOCTURNAL AUDIBLE CALL SURVEYS AND DIP NETTING. UNIVARIATE RESULTS INDICATED THAT: THE LOWEST SPECIES RICHNESS AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE VALUES OCCURRED WITHIN THE UN-RESTORED AREAS, RICHNESS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN ALL RESTORED AREAS RELATIVE TO UN-RESTORED AREAS, ABUNDANCE INCREASED IN SOME RESTORED AREAS BUT NOT OTHERS, AND HIGHEST RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WERE DOCUMENTED IN THE NATURAL WETLANDS.

TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM VEGETATIVE REGROWTH POST-HARVESTING ON AMPHIBIAN HABITAT USE, WE STUDIED THE RESPONSE OF EIGHT SPECIES (FOUR FOREST SPECIALISTS AND FOUR HABITAT GENERALISTS) TO FOUR FORESTRY TREATMENTS (PARTIAL HARVEST, CLEARCUT WITH COARSE WOODY DEBRIS [CWD] REMOVED, CLEARCUT WITH CWD RETAINED, AND UNCUT CONTROL) OVER A 6-YEAR PERIOD, USING REPLICATED EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS IN MAINE, USA. FOREST AMPHIBIANS SHOWED A STRONG NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO CLEARCUTTING THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE STUDY, REGARDLESS OF THE PRESENCE OF CWD, BUT ONLY DURING THE POST-BREEDING SEASON (I.E., SUMMER). THE SPRING BREEDING MIGRATIONS OF WOOD FROGS AND SPOTTED SALAMANDERS TO EXPERIMENTAL POOLS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE FORESTRY TREATMENTS. THE USE OF PARTIAL CUT TREATMENTS BY FOREST AMPHIBIANS DIFFERED BETWEEN ANIMALS EMERGING FROM EXPERIMENTAL POOLS (I.E., JUVENILE WOOD FROGS AND SPOTTED SALAMANDERS), AND ANIMALS ORIGINATING FROM OUTSIDE THE EXPERIMENTAL ARRAYS (I.E., ADULTS OF ALL FOREST SPECIES, JUVENILE WOOD FROGS AND SPOTTED SALAMANDERS). ANIMALS EMERGING FROM OUR EXPERIMENTAL POOLS SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE IN THE USE OF CONTROL AND PARTIAL CUT TREATMENTS, WHILE ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS PREFERRED CONTROL PLOTS. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND A MODEST INCREASE IN THE USE OF CLEARCUTS OVER THE 6. YEARS FOLLOWING HARVESTING BY JUVENILE WOOD FROGS FROM EXPERIMENTAL POOLS (FROM AN 8-FOLD DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOREST AND CLEARCUT TREATMENTS IN THE FIRST YEAR POST-CLEARCUTTING TO A 3-FOLD DIFFERENCE DURING YEARS 3-5). HOWEVER, THIS INCREASE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH VEGETATION REGROWTH. FOREST SPECIALISTS DECLINED IN ABUNDANCE IN ALL TREATMENTS BEGINNING 2-3. YEARS POST-DISTURBANCE. DESPITE HIGH YEARLY FLUCTUATIONS IN ABUNDANCE, THERE WAS A SHIFT IN RELATIVE ABUNDANCE TOWARDS HABITAT GENERALIST SPECIES, MOST NOTABLY GREEN FROG JUVENILES. MOST HABITAT GENERALIST SPECIES WERE NOT AFFECTED BY CLEARCUTTING OR VEGETATIVE REGROWTH; HOWEVER, WE OBSERVED A LOWER USE OF CLEARCUT TREATMENTS BY GREEN FROGS STARTING 3. YEARS POST-HARVESTING, PERHAPS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN HABITAT RESISTANCE TO MOVEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH VEGETATIVE REGROWTH. THESE GENERAL PATTERNS OF HABITAT USE WERE OVERRIDDEN AT THE LOCAL SCALE BY SITE-SPECIFIC VARIATION IN THE USE OF FORESTRY TREATMENTS, MOST EVIDENT IN EMIGRATING JUVENILE WOOD FROGS. FROM A MANAGEMENT STANDPOINT, IMPLEMENTING BROAD SILVICULTURAL PRESCRIPTIONS COULD BE A VIABLE STRATEGY IN EXTENSIVELY FORESTED LANDSCAPES, BUT LOCAL VARIATION IN HABITAT USE HAS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED WHEN MANAGERS FOCUS ON A LIMITED AREA. © 2012 ELSEVIER B.V.",2

ECHOLOCATION CALL RECORDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF BATS USING UNDERPASSES IN PREFERENCE TO CROSSING THE ROAD ABOVE, AND THE HEIGHT AT WHICH BATS CROSSED. AT GANTRIES, PROXIMITY TO THE GANTRY AND HEIGHT OF CROSSING BATS WERE MEASURED. DATA WERE COMPARED TO THOSE FROM ADJACENT, SEVERED COMMUTING ROUTES THAT HAD NO CROSSING STRUCTURE.

UNDERPASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ALLOW BATS TO CROSS ROADS SAFELY IF BUILT ON PRE-CONSTRUCTION COMMUTING ROUTES. BAT GANTRIES WERE INEFFECTIVE AND USED BY A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF BATS, EVEN UP TO NINE YEARS AFTER CONSTRUCTION. MOST BATS NEAR GANTRIES CROSSED ROADS ALONG SEVERED, PRE-CONSTRUCTION COMMUTING ROUTES AT HEIGHTS THAT PUT THEM IN THE PATH OF VEHICLES.

DIFFERENCES IN INSECT ABUNDANCE WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT WHEN WE COMPARED SPECIFIC AES MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTIONS WITH EQUIVALENT CONVENTIONALLY-MANAGED FEATURES. THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE INFLUENCED BAT ACTIVITY; FRAGMENTATION METRICS RELATED TO WOODLAND CONFIGURATION WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS INFLUENCING BAT ACTIVITY LEVELS.

DESPITE THE ENERGETIC BENEFITS OF LEDS, THEIR ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED. USING AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH, WE SHOW THAT LED STREET LIGHTS CAUSED A REDUCTION IN ACTIVITY OF SLOW-FLYING BATS (RHINOLOPHUS HIPPOSIDEROS AND MYOTIS SPP.). BOTH R. HIPPOSIDEROS AND MYOTIS SPP. ACTIVITIES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED EVEN DURING LOW LIGHT LEVELS OF 3.6 LUX. THERE WAS NO EFFECT OF LED LIGHTING ON THE RELATIVELY FAST-FLYING PIPISTRELLUS PIPISTRELLUS, PIPISTRELLUS PYGMAEUS AND NYCTALUS/EPTESICUS SPP. WE PROVIDE THE FIRST EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTS OF LED LIGHTS ON BATS. DESPITE HAVING CONSIDERABLE ENERGY-SAVING BENEFITS, LED LIGHTS CAN POTENTIALLY FRAGMENT COMMUTING ROUTES FOR BATS WITH ASSOCIATED NEGATIVE CONSERVATION CONSEQUENCES. OUR RESULTS ADD TO THE GROWING EVIDENCE OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF LIGHTING ON A WIDE RANGE OF TAXA.

IN CONTRAST, WE HAVE VIRTUALLY NO INFORMATION ON HOW ENSEMBLES OF AERIAL INSECTIVOROUS BATS--NEARLY HALF THE NEOTROPICAL BAT SPECIES--CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO HABITAT MODIFICATION. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF AGROECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT ON INSECTIVOROUS BATS, WE STUDIED THEIR DIVERSITY AND ACTIVITY IN SOUTHERN CHIAPAS, MEXICO, A LANDSCAPE DOMINATED BY COFFEE AGROFORESTRY. WE USED ACOUSTIC MONITORING AND LIVE CAPTURES TO CHARACTERIZE THE INSECTIVOROUS BAT ENSEMBLE IN FOREST FRAGMENTS AND COFFEE PLANTATIONS DIFFERING IN THE STRUCTURAL AND TAXONOMIC COMPLEXITY OF SHADE TREES. WE CAPTURED BATS OF 12 NON-PHYLLOSTOMID SPECIES; ACOUSTIC MONITORING REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF AT LEAST 12 MORE SPECIES OF AERIAL INSECTIVORES. RICHNESS OF FOREST BATS WAS THE SAME ACROSS ALL LAND-USE TYPES; IN CONTRAST, SPECIES RICHNESS OF OPEN-SPACE BATS INCREASED IN LOW SHADE, INTENSIVELY MANAGED COFFEE PLANTATIONS. CONVERSELY, ONLY FOREST BATS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN ENSEMBLE STRUCTURE (AS MEASURED BY SIMILARITY INDICES) ACROSS LAND-USE TYPES.

SMALL TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES, MANY OF WHICH ARE ADAPTED TO OPEN DESERT HABITATS, ARE DECLINING. ONE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE INVASIVE PLANTS CONTRIBUTE TO THE DECLINE BY ALTERING VEGETATIVE STRUCTURE. ALTHOUGH CATTLE MAY HAVE ORIGINALLY BEEN A FACTOR IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THESE NON-NATIVE PLANTS, THEIR GRAZING MAY BENEFIT THE TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES BY MAINTAINING AN OPEN STRUCTURE, ESPECIALLY DURING AVERAGE OR WET WINTERS WHEN THE EXOTIC GRASSES GROW ESPECIALLY DENSE. WE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED THE EFFECT OF CATTLE GRAZING ON INVASIVE PLANTS AND A COMMUNITY OF SMALL VERTEBRATES AT A SITE IN THE SOUTHWESTERN SAN JOAQUIN DESERT.

WE ALSO RECORDED ABUNDANCES OF THE NON-PROTECTED WESTERN WHIPTAIL LIZARDS (ASPIDOSCELIS TIGRIS), SIDE-BLOTCHED LIZARDS (UTA STANSBURIANA), SAN JOAQUIN POCKET MICE (PEROGNATHUS INORNATUS INORNATUS), AND HEERMANN'S KANGAROO RATS (DIPDOMYS HEERMANNI). BASED ON REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) AND A 0.05 ALPHA LEVEL, ONLY HEERMANN'S KANGAROO RATS SHOWED A TREATMENT EFFECT; THEY WERE MORE ABUNDANT ON THE CONTROL PLOTS. HOWEVER, THIS EFFECT COULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE NATURAL RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF SALTBUSH (ATRIPLEX SPP.) ON PART OF THE STUDY SITE. SALTBUSH RETURN ALSO FAVORED WESTERN WHIPTAIL LIZARDS AND SAN JOAQUIN ANTELOPE SQUIRRELS. A REGRESSION ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT POPULATIONS OF BLUNT-NOSED LEOPARD LIZARD AND GIANT KANGAROO RAT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER IN GRAZED PLOTS THAN THE UNGRAZED CONTROLS, AND ABUNDANCES OF 6 OF 8 SPECIES WERE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH INCREASED RESIDUAL DRY MATTER. WITH RELAXED ALPHA VALUES TO DECREASE TYPE II ERROR, POPULATIONS OF BLUNT-NOSED LEOPARD LIZARDS (500% GREATER), SAN JOAQUIN ANTELOPE SQUIRRELS (85% GREATER), AND SHORT-NOSED KANGAROO RATS (73% GREATER) INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY ON GRAZED PLOTS OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY COMPARED TO UNGRAZED PLOTS. WE DID NOT FIND GRAZING TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT ABUNDANCE OF ANY SPECIES WE STUDIED. WHEN HERBACEOUS COVER IS LOW DURING YEARS OF BELOW AVERAGE RAINFALL IN DESERTS AND OTHER ARID AREAS, GRAZING MAY NOT BE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN POPULATIONS OF SMALL VERTEBRATES.

MEAN HEIGHT OF THE TREES WHERE LORISES SLEPT WAS 20.2 ± 9.0 M (N = 230). THE PYGMY LORISES SLEPT MOSTLY IN THE >8 M BAND, THE AREA OF HIGHEST TREE CONNECTIVITY. OF THE PYGMY LORISES STUDIED 38% (5/13) WERE FOUND DEAD, 7% (1/13) WERE RETURNED TO CAPTIVITY DUE TO SEVERE LOSS OF CONDITION AND FOR 23% (3/13) THE OUTCOME IS UNKNOWN DUE TO EARLY COLLAR LOSS. CAUSES OF DEATH INCLUDED HYPERTHERMIA AND NATURAL PREDATION. THE REMAINING 30% (4/13), 2 MALES AND 2 FEMALES, WERE IN GOOD CONDITION WHEN LAST TRACKED BEFORE PREMATURE COLLAR DROP-OFF, UP TO 73 D AFTER RELEASE.

VARIATION IN GLUCOCORTICOID LEVELS OF THE SAME SPECIES BETWEEN PROTECTED AND UNPROTECT AREAS SELDOM HAS BEEN MEASURED, AND THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP MAY DEPEND ON SPECIES-SPECIFIC HABITAT REQUIREMENTS AND BIOLOGY. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE FOCUSED ON BLACK HOWLER MONKEYS (ALOUATTA PIGRA), A CANOPY-DWELLING PRIMATE SPECIES, AS A CASE STUDY TO EVALUATE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF LIVING IN UNPROTECTED AREAS, AND RELATE THEM WITH INTRAGROUP COMPETITION AND COMPETITION WITH EXTRAGROUP INDIVIDUALS. FROM FEBRUARY 2006 TO SEPTEMBER 2007 WE COLLECTED 371 FECAL SAMPLES FROM 21 ADULTS BELONGING TO FIVE GROUPS (TWO FROM PROTECTED AND THREE FROM UNPROTECTED AREAS) IN CAMPECHE, MEXICO. WE RECORDED AGONISTIC INTERACTIONS WITHIN GROUPS AND ENCOUNTERS WITH OTHER GROUPS (1,200 H OF BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS), AND DETERMINED FECAL GLUCOCORTICOID METABOLITE (FGM) CONCENTRATIONS WITH RADIOIMMUNOASSAYS. WE USED LINEAR MIXED MODELS AND AKAIKE'S INFORMATION CRITERION TO CHOOSE THE BEST MODEL EXPLAINING VARIATION IN FGM CONCENTRATIONS BETWEEN PROTECTED AND UNPROTECTED AREAS CALCULATED FROM FIVE CATEGORICAL VARIABLES: HABITAT TYPE (PROTECTED VS. UNPROTECTED), PARTICIPATION IN AGONISTIC INTERACTIONS, INTERGROUP ENCOUNTERS, SEX AND FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE STATE, AND SEASON. THE BEST MODEL INCLUDED HABITAT TYPE, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN HABITAT TYPE AND AGONISM, AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN HABITAT TYPE AND SEASON. FGM CONCENTRATIONS WERE HIGHER IN UNPROTECTED HABITATS, PARTICULARLY WHEN INDIVIDUALS WERE INVOLVED IN AGONISTIC INTERACTIONS; SEASONAL VARIATION IN FGM CONCENTRATIONS WAS ONLY DETECTED IN PROTECTED HABITATS. HIGH FGM CONCENTRATIONS IN BLACK HOWLER MONKEYS LIVING IN UNPROTECTED HABITATS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED WITHIN-GROUP FOOD COMPETITION AND PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO ANTHROPOGENIC STRESSORS AND OVERALL FOOD SCARCITY.

SOME ARE CONFISCATED AND REHABILITATED, THEN KEPT IN SANCTUARIES OR REINTRODUCED INTO THE WILD. PRIOR TO REINTRODUCTION, THE ABILITY OF THE ORPHANS TO SURVIVE INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED.

THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE VARIATIONS ON THEIR WELL-BEING (PLAY BEHAVIOUR) AND THE GROUP COHESION (SPATIAL PROXIMITY AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS) WERE EXAMINED. LIKE WILD WLGS, DIETS SHIFTED SEASONALLY FROM FRUGIVOROUS TO FOLIVOROUS, WHILE THE SAME STAPLE FOODS WERE CONSUMED AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF DIALIUM FRUITS WERE SEASONALLY GATHERED HIGH IN TREES. WHEN SUCCULENT FRUIT INTAKE WAS THE HIGHEST, THUS PROVIDING HIGH ENERGY FROM SUGAR, JUVENILES SPENT LESS TIME FEEDING, MORE TIME PLAYING AND GROUP COHESION WAS THE HIGHEST.

IN ENGLAND, THIS OBLIGATION HAS RESULTED IN LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS FOR DEROGATION FROM STRICT PROTECTION UNDER LICENSE, PROVIDED ACTIVITIES ARE UNDERTAKEN TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON BAT NUMBERS. WE USED AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH TO ASSESS THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND THE ENGLISH BAT-DEROGATION LICENSING PROCESS AS A WHOLE. WE ANALYZED DATA FROM 389 BAT DEROGATION LICENSES ISSUED IN ENGLAND FROM 2003 TO 2005 RELATING TO 1776 ROOSTS AND 15 SPECIES TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF DEVELOPMENT AND MITIGATION ACTIVITIES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON BATS. OVERALL THE EFFECTS OF LICENSED ACTIVITIES ON ROOSTS WERE NEGATIVE. DESPITE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION AFFORDED TO BATS, THE MAJORITY (68\%) OF ROOSTS FOR WHICH DEROGATION LICENSES WERE ISSUED WERE DESTROYED. THERE WERE SPECIES-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN THE PROBABILITY OF ROOSTS BEING DESTROYED, AND IMPACTS ON ROOSTS DID NOT REFLECT A SPECIES' CONSERVATION STATUS. INFORMATION PROVIDED BY LICENSEES WAS INADEQUATE AND INCONSISTENT. MOST LICENSEES (67\%) FAILED TO SUBMIT POSTDEVELOPMENT REPORTS, AND POSTDEVELOPMENT MONITORING WAS CONDUCTED AT ONLY 19\% OF SITES. DESPITE A MINIMUM OF 4.13 MILLION SPENT ON MITIGATION STRUCTURES FOR BATS FROM 2003 TO 2005, IT WAS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE LICENSING PROCESS MEETS EU OBLIGATIONS.

GREEN ROOFS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN HIGHLY URBANIZED AREAS SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY (NYC), WHICH HAS MORE ROOFTOPS (34\%) THAN GREEN SPACE (13\%). TO DATE, NO STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EXTENT TO WHICH NORTH AMERICAN BATS UTILIZE URBAN GREEN ROOFS. TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF GREEN ROOFS IN SUPPORTING URBAN BATS, WE MONITORED BAT ACTIVITY USING ULTRASONIC RECORDERS ON FOUR GREEN AND FOUR CONVENTIONAL ROOFS LOCATED IN HIGHLY DEVELOPED AREAS OF NYC, WHICH WERE PAIRED TO CONTROL FOR LOCATION, HEIGHT, AND LOCAL VARIABILITY IN SURROUNDING HABITAT AND SPECIES DIVERSITY.

AIMS WE INVESTIGATED THE USE OF YOUNG (4–11 YEARS OLD) TIMBER PLANTATIONS BY BATS IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER VEGETATION CLASSES IN A HIGHLY CLEARED AND PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE IN NORTH-WEST NEW SOUTH WALES (NSW), AUSTRALIA. METHODS INITIALLY, WE RECORDED ACTIVITY IN PADDOCKS BEFORE PLANTATION ESTABLISHMENT, AND THEN FOUR TO SIX YEARS AFTER ESTABLISHMENT. WE COMPARED ACTIVITY WITHIN YOUNG EUCALYPT PLANTATIONS WITH SURROUNDING PADDOCKS AND REMNANT WOODLAND. WE ALSO RADIO-TRACKED FOUR DIFFERENT BAT SPECIES TO INVESTIGATE HOW ROOSTING AND FORAGING WAS APPORTIONED INTO DIFFERENT HABITATS. KEY RESULTS THE ULTRASONIC SURVEY OF BATS FOUND THAT THE YOUNG PLANTATIONS WERE TYPICALLY USED BY 7–8 SPECIES AND ACTIVITY AVERAGED 87 PASSES PER NIGHT. ACTIVITY WITHIN PLANTATIONS WAS SIMILAR TO TREELESS PADDOCKS, AND APPROXIMATELY SIX TIMES LESS THAN IN SMALL REMNANTS. THE VERY HIGH ACTIVITY LEVELS AND FEEDING BUZZES IN SMALL REMNANTS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO RICH, BASALT SOIL (WHICH WAS USED AS A PROXY FOR INVERTEBRATE BIOMASS) ON AGRICULTURAL PLAINS. TOTAL ACTIVITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS WAS CORRELATED POSITIVELY WITH THE NUMBER OF REMNANT TREES ON THE SITE, BUT NEITHER PLANTATION AREA NOR SHAPE INFLUENCED BAT ACTIVITY. PLANTATIONS WERE NOT USED PREFERENTIALLY BY RADIO-TRACKED BATS AT NIGHT COMPARED WITH THEIR AVAILABILITY IN THE LOCAL LANDSCAPE (13–14% BAT USE, 17% AVAILABLE). NO BAT ROOSTS WERE LOCATED WITHIN THE PLANTATIONS. MOST BAT ROOSTS WERE IN TREE HOLLOWS, WHICH WERE ABSENT IN THE PLANTATIONS. DECORTICATING BARK WAS ABUNDANT IN EUCALYPT PLANTATIONS, BUT ONLY NYCTOPHILUS GEOFFROYI WAS OBSERVED BENEATH BARK AND ONLY IN REMNANT TREES OUTSIDE OF PLANTATIONS. CONCLUSIONS YOUNG EUCALYPT PLANTATIONS HAVE LIMITED VALUE FOR BATS, AND THIS IS COMPARABLE TO PREVIOUS STUDIES ON MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FOCUSSED PLANTINGS. IMPLICATIONS THE VALUE OF PLANTATIONS FOR BATS WOULD BE IMPROVED BY RETAINING REMNANT TREES, BOTH IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE AND WITHIN PLANTATIONS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND VARYING TREE DENSITIES TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF ANIMAL SPECIES USING PLANTATIONS.",1

FAUNA UNDERPASSES) MAY REDUCE THE BARRIER IMPACTS OF ROADS AND IMPROVE CONNECTIVITY ACROSS ROADS. USE OF UNDERPASSES BY WILDLIFE LIKELY VARIES AMONG SPECIES DEPENDING ON THEIR MOVEMENT BEHAVIOUR. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE FLIGHT PATTERNS OF INSECTIVOROUS BATS INFLUENCED THEIR USE OF UNDERPASSES. WE MONITORED BAT ACTIVITY UNDER AND ABOVE 6 OPEN-SPAN BRIDGES, 6 BOX CULVERTS AND 6 UNMITIGATED SITES ALONG A MAJOR HIGHWAY IN AUSTRALIA. WE USED POISSON REGRESSION MODELS WITHIN A BAYESIAN FRAMEWORK OF INFERENCE TO COMPARE THE ACTIVITY OF 12 BAT SPECIES (GROUPED INTO THREE GUILDS BASED ON THEIR FLIGHT PATTERNS: CLUTTER-ADAPTED, EDGE-ADAPTED, AND OPEN-ADAPTED SPECIES) UNDER THE STRUCTURES, OVER THE ROAD ABOVE THE STRUCTURES, ABOVE UNMITIGATED SEGMENTS OF THE HIGHWAY, AND IN THE VEGETATION ADJACENT TO THE ROADS. BATS WERE LESS ACTIVE ABOVE THE ROAD THAN THEY WERE IN THE SURROUNDING VEGETATION OR UNDER BRIDGES. TWO OF THE THREE GUILDS (I.E. SEVEN SPECIES) CROSSED THE HIGHWAY MORE UNDER BRIDGES THAN THEY DID UNDER CULVERTS OR BY GOING OVER THE ROAD, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT BRIDGES MAY REDUCE BARRIER EFFECTS OF THE ROAD BETTER THAN CULVERTS.

THINNING OF THESE FORESTS IS A WIDESPREAD MANAGEMENT PRACTICE THAT CAN AFFECT FOREST SPECIES, INCLUDING ECHOLOCATING BATS AND THEIR PREY. WE COMPARED TOTAL ACTIVITY OF 11 BAT TAXA, FORAGING ACTIVITY OF SIX BAT GUILDS AND BIOMASS OF 11 INSECT ORDERS ACROSS FOUR FOREST THINNING CATEGORIES IN MANAGED REMNANT EUCALYPT FORESTS IN SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA: UNTHINNED REGROWTH, FOREST THINNED RECENTLY (0–4 YEARS) AND IN THE MEDIUM TERM (5–10 YEARS) AND REFERENCE (MATURE OPEN FOREST). THINNING HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT AT LARGE (˜350 HA) SPATIAL SCALES.

INSECT BIOMASS WAS GREATEST IN UNTHINNED SITES, AND WHILE BAT ACTIVITY WAS RELATED TO PREY BIOMASS, THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS WEAK IN UNTHINNED SITES. TOGETHER, THIS SUGGESTS THAT FOREST STRUCTURE WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PREY AVAILABILITY OR TIME SINCE THINNING IN INFLUENCING BAT ACTIVITY PATTERNS.

WE EVALUATED A PRIORI HYPOTHESES IN AN INFORMATION THEORETIC APPROACH BY EVALUATING SUPPORT FOR CANDIDATE MODELS THAT INCLUDED HABITAT, LANDSCAPE, AND MANAGEMENT EFFECTS. SITE OCCUPANCY OF EVENING BATS (NYCTICEIUS HUMERALIS) WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO POLETIMBER AND SAWTIMBER DENSITY AND POSITIVELY RELATED TO FIRE FREQUENCY, WHILE NORTHERN LONG-EARED BAT (MYOTIS SEPTENTRIONALIS) SITE OCCUPANCY WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO POLETIMBER DENSITY AND NEGATIVELY RELATED TO UNDERSTORY STEM DENSITIES. SITE OCCUPANCY OF BIG BROWN BATS (EPTESICUS FUSCUS), EASTERN RED BATS (LASIURUS BOREALIS), AND TRI-COLORED BATS (PERIMYOTIS SUBFLAVUS) WERE MOSTLY NOT RELATED TO LOCAL VEGETATION STRUCTURE AND SITE OCCUPANCY WAS HIGH ACROSS THE SAVANNA, WOODLAND, FOREST GRADIENT.

NEARLY 50\% OF THE WORLD'S THREATENED BATS ARE ISLAND ENDEMICS AND BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN THE ONLY NATIVE MAMMALS ON ISLANDS, THEY FULFIL IMPORTANT ECOLOGICAL ROLES SUCH AS POLLINATION AND SEED DISPERSAL. LONG-TAILED BATS (CHALINOLOBUS TUBERCULATUS) ARE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED BECAUSE OF PREDATION BY EXOTIC MAMMALS, PARTICULARLY SHIP RATS (RATTUS RATIOS), INTRODUCED BY HUMANS TO THE ISLAND ARCHIPELAGO OF NEW ZEALAND. WE MONITORED THE SURVIVAL OF BATS IN THREE COLONIES IN TEMPERATE RAINFOREST IN FIORDLAND OVER 22 YEARS. SINCE 2009, WE CONTROLLED PREDATORS DURING IRRUPTION PHASES AND COMPARED SURVIVAL OF BATS IN PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED AREAS WITH SURVIVAL IN FOREST BLOCKS TREATED USING RODENTICIDES DEPLOYED IN BAIT STATIONS. SURVIVAL WAS ESTIMATED USING MULTI-STATE MARK-RECAPTURE MODELS IN PROGRAM MARK 7.0 WITH > 15,000 BATS TAGGED.

THUS, EFFECTIVE PREDATOR CONTROL IS ESSENTIAL FOR RECOVERING LONG-TAILED BAT POPULATIONS. WARMING TEMPERATURES INDICATE THAT PREDATOR IRRUPTIONS ARE BECOMING MORE FREQUENT, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE MORE PREDATOR CONTROL IN THE FUTURE THAN AT PRESENT IF DECLINES IN BAT POPULATIONS ARE TO BE REVERSED.

BATS SURVEYS WERE CARRIED OUT IN THREE TYPES OF OLIVE FARMS REPRESENTING INCREASING LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT INTENSITY: (1) TRADITIONAL OLIVE FARMS, MANAGED WITH FEW OR NO CHEMICAL INPUTS OR MANUAL LABOR (2) SEMI-INTENSIVE OLIVE FARMS, WHICH SHARE CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS WITH TRADITIONAL PLANTATIONS, BUT ARE MORE INTENSIVELY MANAGED; (3) INTENSIVE OLIVE FARMS, WHICH ARE MANAGED WITH HIGH AND FREQUENT CHEMICAL INPUTS, AND HIGHLY MECHANIZED SYSTEMS. WE FOUND DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES RICHNESS AND ACTIVITY LEVELS BETWEEN FARMING PRACTICES. BOTH THE NUMBER OF SPECIES AND FORAGING ACTIVITY DECLINED WITH INCREASING MANAGEMENT INTENSITY. HOWEVER, OLIVE GROVES AS A WHOLE SHOWED A LOWER NUMBER OF SPECIES COMPARED WITH THE REGIONAL SPECIES POOL AND EXTREMELY LOW ACTIVITY LEVELS, SUGGESTING THAT LARGE AND HOMOGENEOUS OLIVE MONOCULTURES MAY SERVE MORE AS COMMUTING AREAS THAN TRUE FORAGING HABITATS FOR BATS. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY EXPLICITLY DEMONSTRATING THE PERVASIVE IMPACT OF OLIVE FARMING ON THE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND ACTIVITY LEVELS OF INSECTIVOROUS BATS. IN THE FACE OF AN EVEN-INCREASING PROPORTION OF LAND SURFACE DEVOTED TO OLIVE FARMING IN MEDITERRANEAN LANDSCAPES, OUR FINDINGS ARE THEREFORE OF GREAT CONCERN. WE SUGGEST THAT INCREASING HABITAT HETEROGENEITY WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO PRESERVE THE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONALITY OF INSECTIVOROUS BATS IN EXTENSIVE OLIVE MONOCULTURES. © 2015 THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.",1

YEARS, 94% OF ROOSTS IN FOREST AND 40% OF ROOSTS IN PASTURE HAD BEEN USED BY BATS AT LEAST ONCE - PRIMARILY FOR NOCTURNAL FEEDING. MAXIMUM DAILY TEMPERATURE INSIDE OF ROOSTS WAS THE BEST MICROCLIMATIC PREDICTOR OF BAT VISITATION. WE IDENTIFIED AT LEAST FIVE SPECIES OF BATS THAT VISITED ROOSTS, INCLUDING TWO FRUGIVORES (CAROLLIA AND GLOSSOPHAGA SPP.). BAT-MEDIATED SEED DISPERSAL INCREASED WITH THE NUMBER OF FRUGIVOROUS BAT DETECTIONS AT ROOSTS, BUT SEEDLING RECRUITMENT DID NOT INCREASE WITH EITHER BAT DETECTIONS OR SEED ABUNDANCE OVER A 2-YEAR PERIOD. GIVEN THAT BATS RARELY USED ROOSTS IN PASTURES, AND BAT VISITATION DID NOT INCREASE SEEDLING RECRUITMENT, OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT ARTIFICIAL BAT ROOSTS DID NOT ACCELERATE FOREST REGENERATION IN ABANDONED, PREMONTANE PASTURES IN SOUTHERN COSTA RICA. THIS METHOD COULD BE REFINED BY INVESTIGATING ALTERNATIVE ROOST DESIGNS, BARRIERS TO SEEDLING RECRUITMENT BELOW ROOSTS, IMPROVEMENT OF ROOST MICROCLIMATIC CONDITIONS IN PASTURES, AND ABILITY OF BATS TO DETECT ROOSTS IN DIFFERENT HABITATS. © 2013 ELSEVIER LTD.",1

FOREST BAT POPULATIONS ARE KNOWN TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SUCH AS PEST CONTROL AND BAT BOXES HAVE BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR MANAGEMENT OPTIONS FOR COUNTERACTING THE LOSS OF ROOSTS. HOWEVER, BAT BOXES TEND TO BE EMPLOYED IN NON-NATIVE FORESTS NEAR HIGHLY HUMANIZED AREAS WHERE HUMAN DISTURBANCE IS HIGHER. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE HOW THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AFFECTS BAT BOX OCCUPANCY IN URBAN NON-NATIVE FORESTS ALONG THE MEDITERRANEAN CORRIDOR IN THE NORTHEASTERN IBERIAN PENINSULA. TWO HUNDRED WOODEN BAT BOXES WERE MONITORED IN YOUNG NON-NATIVE FORESTS IN THE PERIOD 2004–2012. THE INFLUENCE OF LAND COVER ON OCCUPANCY RATE OF BAT BOXES WAS ANALYSED AT THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL IN A 5 KM BUFFER AROUND BAT-BOX STATIONS. IN TOTAL, 1659 INSPECTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT, IN WHICH A 15 % OCCUPANCY RATE WAS DETECTED. BAT BOXES HOSTED THREE DIFFERENT SPECIES (PIPISTRELLUS PYGMAEUS, PIPISTRELLUS KUHLII AND NYCTALUS LEISLERI). MORE THAN 70 % OF THE OCCUPANCY CAN BE EXPLAINED BY HABITAT AND SPATIAL COMPOSITION. THE PRESENCE OF URBAN AREAS AROUND BAT BOXES TENDS TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BAT OCCUPATION RATES; BY CONTRAST, FOREST COVERAGE HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT, ESPECIALLY FOR THE TREE-DWELLING BATS. THESE PATTERNS COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LARGE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE ROOSTS IN BUILDINGS, MICROHABITAT OR PHYLOPATRY. THUS, TO INCREASE SUCCESS, WE SUGGEST THAT LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN USING BAT BOXES FOR CONSERVATION. © 2016, SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA NEW YORK.",1

CHANGES IN THESE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES SUCH AS HERBICIDE AND TILLAGE REDUCTION HAVE VARIABLE EFFECTS AMONG TAXA, ESPECIALLY AT THE TOP OF THE TROPHIC NETWORK INCLUDING INSECTIVOROUS BATS. VERY FEW STUDIES COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ON SUCH TAXA, AND OVERALL, ONLY AS A COMPARISON OF CONVENTIONAL VERSUS ORGANIC FARMING WITHOUT ACCURATELY ACCOUNTING FOR UNDERLYING PRACTICES, ESPECIALLY IN CONVENTIONAL WHERE MANY ALTERNATIVES EXIST. DIVERGENT RESULTS FOUNDED IN THESE PREVIOUS STUDIES COULD BE DRIVEN BY THIS LACK OF CLARIFICATION ABOUT SOME UNCONSIDERED PRACTICES INSIDE BOTH CONVENTIONAL AND ORGANIC SYSTEMS. WE SIMULTANEOUSLY COMPARED, OVER WHOLE NIGHTS, BAT ACTIVITY ON CONTIGUOUS WHEAT FIELDS OF ONE ORGANIC AND THREE CONVENTIONAL FARMING SYSTEMS LOCATED IN AN INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE. THE STUDIED ORGANIC FIELDS (OT) USED TILLAGE (I.E., INVERSION OF SOIL) WITHOUT CHEMICAL INPUTS. IN STUDIED CONVENTIONAL FIELDS, DIFFERENCES CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING: TILLAGE USING FEW HERBICIDES (T), CONSERVATION TILLAGE (I.E., NO INVERSION OF SOIL) USING FEW HERBICIDES (CT), AND CONSERVATION TILLAGE USING MORE HERBICIDE (CTH), TO CONTROL WEEDS. USING 64 RECORDING SITES (OT = 12; T = 21; CT = 13; CTH = 18), WE SAMPLED SEVERAL SITES PER SYSTEM PLACED INSIDE THE FIELDS EACH NIGHT. WE SHOWED THAT BAT ACTIVITY WAS ALWAYS HIGHER IN OT THAN IN T SYSTEMS FOR TWO (PIPISTRELLUS KUHLII AND PIPISTRELLUS PIPISTRELLUS) OF THREE SPECIES AND FOR ONE (PIPISTRELLUS SPP.) OF TWO GENERA, AS WELL AS GREATER SPECIES RICHNESS. THE SAME RESULTS WERE FOUND FOR THE CT VERSUS T SYSTEM COMPARISON. CTH SYSTEM SHOWED HIGHER ACTIVITY THAN T FOR ONLY ONE GENUS (PIPISTRELLUS SPP.). WE DID NOT DETECT ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OT AND CT SYSTEMS, AND CT SHOWED HIGHER ACTIVITY THAN CTH SYSTEM FOR ONLY ONE SPECIES (PIPISTRELLUS KUHLII). ACTIVITY IN OT OF PIPISTRELLUS SPP. WAS OVERALL 3.6 AND 9.3 TIMES HIGHER THAN CTH AND T SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, AND 6.9 TIMES HIGHER IN CT THAN T SYSTEMS. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT AN IMPORTANT BENEFIT OF ORGANIC FARMING AND CONTRASTED EFFECTS IN CONVENTIONAL FARMING. THAT THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES DETECTED BETWEEN THE ORGANIC AND ONE CONVENTIONAL SYSTEM IS A MAJOR RESULT. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT EVEN IF ORGANIC FARMING IS PRESENTLY DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT AND REQUIRES A CHANGE OF ECONOMIC CONTEXT FOR FARMERS, CONSIDERABLE AND EASY IMPROVEMENTS IN CONVENTIONAL FARMING ARE ATTAINABLE, WHILE MAINTAINING YIELDS AND APPROACHING THE ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF ORGANIC METHODS. © 2017 THE AUTHORS.

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

HOWEVER, ABANDONED MINES POSE PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARDS AND OFTEN ARE GATED TO REDUCE RISK TO HUMANS WHILE MAINTAINING ACCESS TO BATS. TO DATE THERE IS LIMITED INFORMATION ON SPECIES-SPECIFIC ACCEPTANCE OF GATES AT ABANDONED MINES.

WE USED AN IN SITU MOCK GATE EXPERIMENT, COMPARISON OF BAT USE BEFORE AND AFTER GATING, AND GENETIC IDENTIFICATION OF GUANO IN GATED MINES FOR OUR SHORT-, MID-, AND LONG-TERM STUDIES, RESPECTIVELY. IN OUR SHORT-TERM STUDY, BATS INCREASED ENERGETICALLY DEMANDING BEHAVIORS FOLLOWING GATE INSTALLATION. ALTHOUGH WE DETECTED NO DIFFERENCE IN RESPONSES TO GATE MATERIAL OR HEIGHT, A LESS MANEUVERABLE BAT SPECIES CIRCLED, COLLIDED, AND LANDED MORE FREQUENTLY ON GATES THAN DID AN AGILE SPECIES. IN THE MID-TERM STUDY, ACTIVITY REMAINED STABLE OR INCREASED AT 73% OF MINES AFTER GATING COMPARED TO BEFORE GATING, ALTHOUGH NUMBER OF MATERNITY COLONIES DECREASED. IN THE LONG-TERM STUDY, ELEVATION, PORTAL AREA, NUMBER OF MINE LEVELS, AND ENTRANCES WERE MORE IMPORTANT THAN GATES IN PREDICTING PRESENCE OF 4 BAT SPECIES, INCLUDING 2 SUBTERRANEAN OBLIGATES.

WE PAID CLOSE ATTENTION TO COMPARISON BETWEEN GRAVEL-SAND PITS STATES AND AQUATIC HABITATS, BECAUSE THE RESTORATION PROCESS IN THE GRAVEL-SAND PITS STUDIED OFTEN LEADS TO BODIES OF WATER AND THESE HABITATS ARE AMONG THE MOST FAVORABLE FOR NUMEROUS BATS SPECIES. IN ADDITION, WE FOCUS OUR COMPARISONS ON ARABLE LAND BECAUSE NEW GRAVEL-SAND PIT SETTLEMENTS ARE USUALLY PLANNED ON SUCH AGRICULTURAL LAND AND FURTHERMORE BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE MAJOR LAND-USE PRESSURE FOR BATS. WE FOUND THAT BAT ACTIVITY IN GRAVEL-SAND PIT DISPLAYS A RANGE COMPARABLE TO WHAT IS OBSERVED IN NUMEROUS HABITATS, THOUGH IT DOES APPEAR BOTH SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN IN BODIES OF WATER AND GREATER THAN ARABLE LAND. BAT ACTIVITY APPEARS INCREASING DURING THE GRAVEL-SAND PIT LIFE'S CYCLE.

THE ROCKET BOX STYLE PROVIDED LARGER ENTRANCE AREA, SURFACE AREA, AND VOLUME VERSUS OTHER ROOST TYPES. MICROCLIMATE VARIED WITH ROOST DESIGN. MORE POSITIONS INSIDE THE BAT BOX AND ROCKET BOX STAYED WITHIN CRITICAL TEMPERATURE LIMITS FOR BATS (0-45&#XB0;C)-I.E., WERE USABLE.

THE CORRIDORS WERE IN THREE TYPES OF HUMAN-DOMINATED LAND-USE DESIGNATIONS WITH VARYING LEVELS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY: AGRICULTURAL, INDUSTRIAL AND OPEN-SPACE RECREATIONAL LAND. WE FOUND THAT ELEPHANTS USED THE CORRIDORS WITHIN ALL THREE LAND-USE DESIGNATIONS AND WE IDENTIFIED, USING A MODEL SELECTION APPROACH, THAT SEASON, TIME OF DAY AND RAINFALL WERE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE PRESENCE OF ELEPHANTS IN THE CORRIDORS. ELEPHANTS MOVED MORE SLOWLY THROUGH THE NARROW CORRIDORS COMPARED WITH THEIR MOVEMENT PATTERNS THROUGH BROADER, WIDE-RANGING CORRIDORS.

TWO INTERRELATED AND MORE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS GO UNANSWERED: HAVE THE MAJOR BREEDING PROGRAMS SUCCEEDED AT THE BASIC LEVEL OF MAINTAINING AND EXPANDING POPULATIONS, AND IS THERE ROOM TO EXPAND THEM? I USED PUBLISHED COUNTS OF BIRTHS AND DEATHS FROM 1970 TO 2011 TO QUANTIFY RATES OF GROWTH OF 118 CAPTIVE-BRED MAMMALIAN POPULATIONS. THESE RATES DID NOT VARY WITH BODY MASS, CONTRARY TO STRONG PREDICTIONS MADE IN THE ECOLOGICAL LITERATURE.

SIN EMBARGO, EL NUMERO DE ESPECIES SELECCIONADAS PARA EL MANEJO ES RELATIVAMENTE PEQUENO Y ESTA ENFOCADO EN MAMIFEROS GRANDES Y CARISMATICOS QUE NO ESTAN NECESARIAMENTE BAJO UNA FUERTE AMENAZA DE EXTINCION Y QUE NO SIEMPRE SON BUENOS CANDIDATOS PARA LA REINTRODUCCION A LA VIDA SILVESTRE. DOS PREGUNTAS INTERCONECTADAS Y MAS FUNDAMENTALES SIGUEN SIN RESPUESTA: HAN TENIDO EXITO LA MAYORIA DE LOS PROGRAMAS DE REPRODUCCION EN EL NIVEL BASICO DE MANTENER Y EXPANDIR POBLACIONES Y HAY ESPACIO PARA EXPANDIRLAS?

LA MAYORIA DE LAS POBLACIONES DE MAMIFEROS CON MAYOR MANEJO SE EXPANDIO CONSISTENTEMENTE Y MUY POCOS PROGRAMAS FALLARON. SIN EMBARGO, LAS TASAS DE CRECIMIENTO DECLINARON DRAMATICAMENTE.

WE REPORT ON A 30-YEAR INVENTORY OF THE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED FENNOSCANDIAN ARCTIC FOX VULPES LAGOPUS L., INCLUDING YEARLY SURVEYS OF 600 FOX DENS COVERING 21000KM2. THESE SURVEYS SHOWED THAT THE POPULATION WAS CLOSE TO EXTINCTION IN 2000, WITH 4060 ADULT ANIMALS LEFT. HOWEVER, THE POPULATION SUBSEQUENTLY SHOWED A FOURFOLD INCREASE IN SIZE. DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, CONSERVATION ACTIONS THROUGH SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING AND PREDATOR REMOVAL WERE IMPLEMENTED IN SEVERAL REGIONS ACROSS SCANDINAVIA, ENCOMPASSING 79\% OF THE AREA.

THE PRESENT STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT CARNIVORE POPULATION DECLINES MAY BE REVERSED THROUGH EXTENSIVE ACTIONS THAT TARGET SPECIFIC THREATS.

WITHIN FORESTRY, DIVERSIONARY FEEDING TYPICALLY TARGETS CERVIDS, AND AIMS TO REDUCE BROWSING DAMAGE AND BARK-STRIPPING IN VULNERABLE FOREST STANDS (YOUNG AND MID-AGED FOREST STANDS). BECAUSE THESE STANDS ARE MOST VULNERABLE DURING WINTER, DIVERSIONARY FEEING IS OFTEN RESTRICTED TO THAT SEASON. DESPITE BEING WIDELY APPLIED, CLEAR EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIVERSIONARY FEEDING OF CERVIDS IS LACKING. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIVERSIONARY WINTER FEEDING AS A TOOL TO LURE AWAY A LARGE CERVID, RED DEER (CERVUS ELAPHUS), FROM VULNERABLE FOREST STANDS. FIRST, WE HYPOTHESIZED (H1) THAT DIVERSIONARY FEEDING IS AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS EXPLAINING DIFFERENCES IN RED DEER HABITAT SELECTION BETWEEN SUMMER (I.E., NO FOOD SUPPLY AT FEEDING STATIONS) AND WINTER (I.E., FOOD SUPPLY AD LIBITUM AT FEEDING STATIONS). SECOND, WE HYPOTHESIZED (H2) THAT DIVERSIONARY FEEDING RELEASES RED DEER HABITAT SELECTION PRESSURE IN FOREST STANDS VULNERABLE FOR BROWSING OR BARK-STRIPPING, AND THAT THIS RELEASE DECAYS WITH DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST FEEDING STATION. WE TESTED OUR HYPOTHESES USING RED DEER RELOCATION DATA (11 INDIVIDUALS & 3 YEARS) AND RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTIONS IN AN INTENSIVELY MANAGED AUSTRIAN FOREST. AS EXPECTED, VARIATION IN RED DEER HABITAT SELECTION BETWEEN SUMMER AND WINTER WAS BEST EXPLAINED BY A DIFFERENT RESPONSE TO SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING STATIONS BETWEEN THE SEASONS (H1). DURING WINTER, RED DEER STRONGLY SELECTED FOR AREAS CLOSE TO FEEDING STATIONS, WHEREAS FEEDING STATIONS DID NOT STRONGLY AFFECT THEIR HABITAT SELECTION DURING SUMMER. WE FOUND THAT DIVERSIONARY FEEDING DURING WINTER RELEASED RED DEER HABITAT SELECTION PRESSURE ON VULNERABLE FOREST STANDS, BUT LIMITED TO DISTANCES OF ABOUT 1.3 TO 1.5 KM FROM THE FEEDING STATION, THIS ACCOUNTS FOR 39% OF THE STUDY AREA (H2). OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT DIVERSIONARY FEEDING CAN INDEED BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO MEDIATE HABITAT SELECTION BEHAVIOR AND TO LURE CERVIDS AWAY FROM VULNERABLE FOREST STANDS. HOWEVER, HABITAT SELECTION IS NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD PROXY FOR DAMAGE, AND WHETHER OR NOT DIVERSIONARY FEEDING REDUCES FORESTRY DAMAGE IN THE LONG-TERM REMAINS UNCLEAR, AS IT CAN POSITIVELY FEED-BACK INTO SURVIVAL, REPRODUCTION, AND EVENTUALLY POPULATION GROWTH AND DENSITIES.

IN THE YEAR STARTING IN FEBRUARY OF 2001, 29 LEOPARDS WERE CAPTURED IN THE HUMAN-DOMINATED RURAL LANDSCAPE OF THE JUNNAR REGION (4275 KM2, 185 PEOPLE/KM2), MAHARASHTRA, INDIA, AND RELEASED AN AVERAGE OF 39.5 KM AWAY IN ADJOINING FORESTS. ELEVEN LEOPARDS WERE ALSO RELOCATED TO THE SAME FORESTS FROM OTHER DISTRICTS. PRIOR TO THE LARGE-SCALE TRANSLOCATION PROGRAM, AN AVERAGE OF FOUR LEOPARD ATTACKS ON HUMANS OCCURRED EACH YEAR BETWEEN 1993 AND 2001. AFTER THE TRANSLOCATION PROGRAM WAS INITIATED, THE AVERAGE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY TO 17 ATTACKS. LINEAR AND LOGISTIC MODELS SHOWED THAT ATTACK FREQUENCY INCREASED IN JUNNAR FOLLOWING NEARBY RELEASES OF LEOPARDS AND DECREASED WHEN LEOPARDS WERE REMOVED FOR RELEASES FAR AWAY; THAT ATTACKS BECAME MORE LETHAL WHEN THE NUMBER OF LEOPARDS INTRODUCED FROM OTHER DISTRICTS INCREASED; AND THAT ATTACKS WERE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE REGIONS WHERE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF LEOPARDS HAD BEEN INTRODUCED FROM OTHER AREAS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LEOPARDS DID NOT STAY AT THE RELEASE SITES AND THAT TRANSLOCATION INDUCED ATTACKS ON PEOPLE. POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS FOR THESE RESULTS INCLUDE INCREASED AGGRESSION INDUCED BY STRESS OF THE TRANSLOCATION PROCESS, MOVEMENT THROUGH UNFAMILIAR HUMAN-DOMINATED LANDSCAPES FOLLOWING RELEASE, AND LOSS OF FEAR OF HUMANS DUE TO FAMILIARITY WITH HUMANS ACQUIRED DURING CAPTIVITY. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT REACTIVE SOLUTIONS TO ATTACKS ON HUMANS BY LEOPARDS, SUCH AS TRANSLOCATION, COULD IN FACT INCREASE HUMAN-LEOPARD CONFLICT. MEASURES TO REDUCE HUMAN-CARNIVORE CONFLICTS MAY INCLUDE MORE EFFECTIVE COMPENSATION PROCEDURES TO PAY LIVESTOCK OWNERS FOR THE LOSS OF ANIMALS TO PREDATION BY CARNIVORES, PROVIDING BETTER METHODS OF PROTECTION FOR LIVESTOCK, AND ENCOURAGING GREATER SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRESENCE OF CARNIVORES IN HUMAN-DOMINATED LANDSCAPES. © 2010 SOCIETY FOR CONSERVATION BIOLOGY.",1

A COMMON DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE APPROACHES IS THAT QUARANTINE TENDS TO BE CONDUCTED IN EX SITU CAPTIVITY, WHEREAS DELAYED RELEASES TEND TO INVOLVE IN SITU CONFINEMENT AT THE RELEASE SITE.

WE STUDIED MORTALITY OF CALVES AND OLDER FEMALES DURING THE 4 YEARS BEFORE WOLF CONTROL AND THE FIRST 5 YEARS OF NONLETHAL WOLF CONTROL. DURING THOSE 9 YEARS, ANNUAL MORTALITY RATES AVERAGED 54% FOR CALVES AND 9% FOR ADULT FEMALES. WE DETECTED NO CONVINCING SUPPORT FOR DECREASED WOLF PREDATION DURING NONLETHAL CONTROL. WE ALSO DETECTED NO SUPPORT FOR INCREASED CARIBOU SURVIVAL DURING NONLETHAL OR LETHAL WOLF CONTROL. BASED ON COUNTS OF CARIBOU DURING SUMMER AGGREGATIONS USING A TOTAL SEARCH PHOTOCENSUS TECHNIQUE, RATE OF HERD INCREASE (<U+039B>R) WAS NEGLIGIBLE (<U+039B>R = 1.00) DURING 1990–1995, HIGHEST DURING THE 3 YEARS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE NONLETHAL WOLF CONTROL (<U+039B>R = 1.11, 1995–1998), MODERATE DURING NONLETHAL WOLF CONTROL (<U+039B>R = 1.07, 1998–2003), AND LOW DURING THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDED THE FIRST 5 YEARS OF LETHAL WOLF CONTROL (<U+039B>R = 1.02, 2003–2010). WE COMBINED OBSERVED CAUSE OF DEATH WITH THE 9 ANNUAL MODELED STARTING POPULATIONS (ALL NEWBORN CALVES AND ADULTS) AND ESTIMATED THAT WOLVES KILLED 10–15% OF THE POPULATIONS ANNUALLY, GRIZZLY BEARS (URSUS ARCTOS) KILLED 4–7%, OTHER PREDATORS KILLED 2–4%, NONPREDATION FACTORS KILLED 1–2%, AND HUNTERS KILLED =2%. WOLVES KILLED 5–9% OF THE ANNUAL POPULATIONS AS CALVES AND 5–6% AS ADULTS. IN RETROSPECT, NONLETHAL WOLF CONTROL EFFORTS WERE TOO LOCALIZED TO DECREASE WOLF NUMBERS (E.G., ADJACENT UNTREATED WOLF PACKS REACHED MAX. MEAN NUMBERS). LETHAL WOLF CONTROL EFFORTS HAD ONLY SEASONAL AND LOCALIZED EFFECTS ON WOLF NUMBERS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT STAKEHOLDERS FOCUS ON DESCRIBING A PREFERRED, SUSTAINABLE HERD SIZE, OR NUTRITIONAL STATUS AND PROCEED TOWARD MANAGING THIS INCREASING HERD IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER BECAUSE, WHEN UNGULATES OVERSHOOT CARRYING CAPACITY, THE EFFECTS OF HIGH DENSITY, ADVERSE WEATHER, AND INCREASED PREDATION CAN HAVE SYNERGISTIC NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON PREY NUMBERS AND LONG-LASTING NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON SUSTAINABLE YIELDS, CONTRARY TO THE INTENDED PURPOSE OF THE WOLF CONTROL PROGRAMS. © 2017 THE WILDLIFE SOCIETY. © THE WILDLIFE SOCIETY, 2017",2

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR CAN BE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A MORE DIRECT EVIDENCE FOR A POSSIBLE EFFECT OF REFLECTORS. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYSE ROE DEER BEHAVIOUR IN THE PRESENCE OF A BLUE SEMICIRCLE REFLECTOR, ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY APPLIED WILDLIFE WARNING REFLECTORS IN GERMANY AND OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE. BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSE TO THESE REFLECTORS (CLASSIFIED AS NO REACTION, VIGILANCE, SHORT-DISTANCE FLIGHT AND LONG-DISTANCE FLIGHT) WAS RECORDED BOTH UNDER CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS WITH CAPTIVE ROE DEER AND FOR FREE-RANGING ROE DEER AT ROAD SECTIONS WITH TRAFFIC OCCURRENCE. WE USED GENERALISED LINEAR MIXED MODELS (GLMMS) TO TEST IF REFLECTOR PRESENCE INDUCED THREAT-RELATED BEHAVIOUR (VIGILANCE, FLIGHT) AND MOVEMENT AWAY FROM THE REFLECTORS. WE FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE THAT THE LIGHT STIMULUS EMITTED BY REFLECTORS WAS PERCEIVED AS A THREAT OR INDUCED EVASIVE MOVEMENT.

THE EASTERN NARROW-MOUTHED TOAD EXPERIENCED A 2.5-FOLD INCREASE IN ESTIMATES OF OCCUPANCY IN 2004, POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF THE HIGH AMOUNT OF RAINFALL RECEIVED DURING THAT YEAR, ALONG WITH A DECREASE IN EXTINCTION AND INCREASE IN COLONIZATION OF NEW SITES BETWEEN 2003 AND 2004.

HUNTER SUCCESS DATA PROVIDED FURTHER EVIDENCE OF INCREASED RECRUITMENT ASSOCIATED WITH EXCLOSURES RELATIVE TO THE REMAINDER OF THE STUDY SITE. BECAUSE EXCLOSURES WERE LOCATED ON THE BOUNDARY OF OUR STUDY AREA AND OFF-SITE WHITE-TAILED DEER HARVEST RECORDS WERE NOT AVAILABLE, WE USED ESTIMATES OF DEER DENSITY, SEX RATIOS, REPRODUCTIVE RATES, RELATIVE USE OF EXCLOSURES, AND NEONATE SURVIVAL INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF EXCLOSURES TO PARAMETERIZE A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF OUR 4 EXCLOSURES ON NEONATE RECRUITMENT INTO THE START OF THE FIREARMS HUNTING SEASON ON A 1,600-HA AREA.

MAMMAL COMMUNITIES IN RESTORED AREAS CONVERGED ON UNMINED FOREST COMMUNITIES AS RESTORATION MATURED, AND ALL SPECIES RECOLONISED RAPIDLY, INDICATING THERE WERE NO FILTERS TO MAMMAL RECOLONISATION. IN CONTRAST, REPTILE COMMUNITIES DID NOT CONVERGE IN THE SAME WAY, INDICATING THERE WERE FILTERS THAT SLOWED OR PREVENTED REPTILE RECOLONISATION. WE IDENTIFIED THREE REPTILE SPECIES THAT WERE SLOW, OR FAILED, TO RECOLONISE RESTORED AREAS AND A FOURTH SPECIES THAT RAPIDLY RECOLONISED BUT DISAPPEARED AS RESTORATION MATURED. WE IDENTIFIED LOW COARSE WOODY DEBRIS (CWD) VOLUMES AND HIGH OVERSTOREY STEM DENSITIES AS LIKELY FILTERS; THE FORMER IS A UNIDIRECTIONAL FILTER THAT WILL DECREASE GRADUALLY OVER LONG TIME FRAMES, POSSIBLY CENTURIES, WHILE THE LATTER IS A DYNAMIC FILTER THAT FLUCTUATES IN ITS INTENSITY OVER SHORT TIME FRAMES OF YEARS. 4. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR STUDY ADDS TO GROWING EVIDENCE THAT FILTERS TO FAUNAL RECOLONISATION MAY BE WIDESPREAD IN RESTORED AREAS, WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR RESTORATION PRACTICES. FIRSTLY, EXAMINING INDIVIDUAL SPECIES MAY MORE EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY FILTERS THAN EXAMINING COMMUNITY SUCCESSIONAL PATTERNS. SECONDLY, FILTERS CAN PERSIST OVER LONG TIME FRAMES, POSSIBLY CENTURIES, SO MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS THE PROVISION AND ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT OF CWD, MAY NEED TO OCCUR OVER SIMILAR TIME FRAMES. LASTLY, FILTERS CAN BE DYNAMIC AND REPEATED MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS THINNING, MAY BE REQUIRED TO OVERCOME THESE FILTERS. THE GROWING EVIDENCE FOR FILTERS SUGGESTS THAT FACILITATING FAUNAL RECOLONISATION IS MORE COMPLEX THAN SIMPLY RETURNING VEGETATION TO RESTORATION SITES.",2

WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT GENERAL SURVEYS TRADITIONALLY USED FOR MONITORING WRC BY SMALL MAMMALS MAY BE BIASED BECAUSE THE DEGRADED HABITATS ALONG ROADS ARE MAINLY USED BY GENERALIST AND NOT SPECIALIST SPECIES. FOR THIS REASON, WE COMPARED THE RESULTS OF A GENERAL SMALL-MAMMAL SURVEY WITH THOSE FROM A SPECIES-SPECIFIC ONE, FOCUSING ON 3 STUDY SPECIES: 1 HABITAT GENERALIST (NORTH AMERICAN DEER MOUSE [PEROMYSCUS MANICULATUS]), 1 FOREST SPECIALIST (SOUTHERN RED-BACKED VOLE [MYODES GAPPERI]), AND 1 PRAIRIE SPECIALIST (MEADOW VOLE [MICROTUS PENNSYLVANICUS]). WE SAMPLED ALONG 4 TYPES OF WCS (OVERPASSES, OPEN-SPAN UNDERPASSES, AND BOTH ELLIPTICAL AND BOX CULVERTS) IN BANFF NATIONAL PARK (CANADA), BY PLACING FOOTPRINT TRACK TUBES ALONG THE WCS, AND AS A REFERENCE IN FRONT OF THEIR ENTRANCES (MAINLY LOCATED IN ROADSIDE GRASSLANDS) AND IN THE SURROUNDING WOODLANDS. USING THE TRADITIONAL GENERAL SURVEY, WE DID NOT DETECT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SMALL-MAMMAL PRESENCE AMONG WCS AND REFERENCE SITES.

THE DEER MICE DID NOT SHOW PREFERENCES FOR ANY WCS TYPE, WHEREAS THE SPECIALIST SPECIES (VOLES) USED ONLY OVERPASSES. THEREFORE, GENERAL SURVEYS USED WITHOUT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION CAN UNDERESTIMATE THE VALUE OF WCS FOR SPECIALIST SMALL MAMMALS, WITH RELEVANT CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, WE RECOMMEND SPECIES-SPECIFIC SURVEYS OF WCS SUITABILITY FOR SMALL MAMMALS.

HOWEVER, EXPERIMENTAL TESTING OF SOFT-RELEASE METHODS IS RARE. AIMS TO EXPERIMENTALLY TEST THE EFFECT OF A SOFT-RELEASE METHOD VERSUS A HARD-RELEASE METHOD ON THE INITIAL REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS OF THE EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOT (PERAMELES GUNNII). METHODS WE RELEASED 12 CAPTIVE-BRED EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOTS INTO A PREDATOR-PROOF RESERVE USING TWO METHODS: SOFT-RELEASE (7 DAYS OF ON-SITE ACCLIMATISATION WITH SUPPLEMENTARY FOOD BEFORE RELEASE) AND HARD-RELEASE (NO ACCLIMATISATION AND NO SUPPLEMENTARY FOOD). WE MONITORED THE BANDICOOTS INTENSIVELY VIA RADIO-TRACKING AND LIVE-TRAPPING FOR 4 WEEKS AFTER RELEASE. COMPARED WITH HARD-RELEASE BANDICOOTS, WE PREDICTED THAT SOFT-RELEASE BANDICOOTS WOULD HAVE (1) REDUCED MOVEMENT (FIRST NIGHT DISPERSAL, SITE FIDELITY AND ACTIVITY RANGE), (2) MORE DIRECTED PATTERNS OF HABITAT SELECTION, (3) IMPROVED BODYWEIGHTS AND (4) IMPROVED SURVIVAL. KEY RESULTS THERE WAS NO DETECTABLE DIFFERENCE IN HABITAT SELECTION, OVERALL WEIGHT CHANGE AND SURVIVAL BETWEEN THE SOFT-RELEASE AND HARD-RELEASE GROUPS. THERE WAS MODERATE EVIDENCE THAT, COMPARED WITH THE HARD-RELEASE GROUP, SOFT-RELEASE BANDICOOTS MOVED LESS, DEMONSTRATED LOWER INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN ALL MEASURES OF MOVEMENT, AND LOST WEIGHT MORE GRADUALLY AFTER RELEASE. IN MOST CASES, EFFECT SIZES WERE MODERATE TO LARGE BUT HAD LARGE STANDARD ERRORS OWING TO BOTH SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND HIGH VARIANCE. CONSEQUENTLY, STATISTICAL TESTING FAILED TO DETECT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AT THE 5% LEVEL. CONCLUSIONS DESPITE EVIDENCE THAT THE RELEASE METHOD INFLUENCED SOME OF THE MONITORED BEHAVIOURS, SOFT-RELEASE DID NOT CONFER A CONSISTENT AND SUBSTANTIVE ADVANTAGE FOR CAPTIVE-BRED EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOTS AT OUR SITE. WE CONCLUDE THAT SOFT-RELEASE IS UNLIKELY TO IMPROVE OVERALL REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS FOR THIS SPECIES AT FENCED PREDATOR-FREE SITES. IMPLICATIONS THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE PREFERRED OPTION FOR REINTRODUCTIONS OF EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOTS TO FENCED SITES IS A HARD-RELEASE, INFORMATION THAT IS NOW BEING USED TO GUIDE REINTRODUCTIONS OF THIS SPECIES.

FURTHERMORE, C CRICETUS OCCURRENCE IN RELATION TO LOCAL (VEGETATION DENSITY, COVER OF GRASSES, VEGETATION HEIGHT, SIZE OF WILDFLOWER FIELDS) AND LANDSCAPE SCALE PARAMETERS (PERCENTAGE OF ARABLE LAND, GRASSLAND, FALLOW LAND, DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST FOREST, AND SETTLEMENT) OF SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS WAS ANALYSED. RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE WAS A CONCENTRATION OF C CRICETUS IN SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS, WHILE DENSITIES IN ADJACENT AGRICULTURAL FIELDS WERE CONSTANTLY LOW. HAMSTER OCCURRENCE WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO VEGETATION DENSITY AND GRASS COVER ON SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS AND POSITIVELY RELATED TO DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST FORESTS, PERCENTAGE OF ARABLE LAND AND FALLOW LAND AROUND WILDFLOWER FIELDS. IN CONCLUSION, WE COULD SHOW THAT SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS CAN BE AN IDEAL HABITAT FOR NON-TARGET SPECIES, SUCH AS THE COMMON HAMSTER. HOWEVER, LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE SCALE PARAMETERS OF SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN DESIGNING AES. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",1

USING THE ZONA-FREE SCNT TECHNIQUE, IN VITRO MATURED AND ENUCLEATED DOMESTIC SHEEP OOCYTES WERE RECONSTITUTED WITH NUCLEI DONOR CELLS OF MOUFLON AND DOMESTIC SHEEP, AND THEIR COMPETENCIES FOR IN VITRO DEVELOPMENT TO THE BLASTOCYST STAGE WERE COMPARED. THE CLONED MOUFLON BLASTOCYSTS WERE THEN SURGICALLY TRANSFERRED INTO THE UTERUS OF THE SYNCHRONIZED DOMESTIC SHEEP. KARYOTYPE ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THAT FIBROBLASTS OF THE ESFAHAN MOUFLON HAD THE CORRECT NUMBER OF DIPLOID CHROMOSOMES (2N = 54). EVALUATION OF 907 ACTIVATED RECONSTRUCTS [ESFAHAN MOUFLON (N = 667), DOMESTIC SHEEP (N = 240)] REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE TERM OF BLASTOCYST DEVELOPMENT (7.6 ± 0.5% VS. 9.3 ± 0.5%, RESPECTIVELY). AFTER THE TRANSFER OF 12 CLONED ESFAHAN MOUFLON BLASTOCYSTS TO FIVE DOMESTIC SHEEP RECIPIENTS, TWO (40.0%) PREGNANCIES WERE ESTABLISHED IN WHICH BOTH (100%) WERE SUSTAINED UNTIL CAESAREAN SECTION (DAYS 147 AND 150 OF PREGNANCY, RESPECTIVELY) AND CULMINATED IN THE LIVE BIRTHS OF CLONED ESFAHAN MOUFLON LAMBS. HOWEVER, THE NEWBORNS DID NOT SURVIVE AND DIED SOON AFTER BIRTH. KARYOTYPE AND GENETIC ANALYSES CONFIRMED THAT BOTH CLONES HAD CORRECT DIPLOID CHROMOSOME NUMBER (2N = 54), AND WERE GENETICALLY IDENTICAL TO EACH OTHER IN ADDITION TO THEIR ORIGINAL CELL DONOR.

WE INVESTIGATED 2 APPROACHES FOR IMPROVING LOCAL TOLERANCE OF LIONS: COMPENSATION PAYMENTS FOR LIVESTOCK LOST TO PREDATORS AND LION GUARDIANS, WHICH DRAWS ON LOCAL CULTURAL VALUES AND KNOWLEDGE TO MITIGATE LIVESTOCK-CARNIVORE CONFLICT AND MONITOR CARNIVORES. TO GAUGE THE OVERALL INFLUENCE OF CONSERVATION INTERVENTION, WE COMBINED BOTH PROGRAMS INTO A SINGLE CONSERVATION TREATMENT VARIABLE. USING 8 YEARS OF LION KILLING DATA, WE APPLIED MANSKI'S PARTIAL IDENTIFICATION APPROACH WITH BOUNDED ASSUMPTIONS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF CONSERVATION TREATMENT ON LION KILLING IN 4 CONTIGUOUS AREAS. IN 3 OF THE AREAS, CONSERVATION TREATMENT WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION IN LION KILLING. WE THEN APPLIED A GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE EFFICACY OF THE 2 INTERVENTIONS. THE MODEL ESTIMATED THAT COMPENSATION RESULTED IN AN 87-91\% DROP IN THE NUMBER OF LIONS KILLED, WHEREAS LION GUARDIANS (OPERATING IN COMBINATION WITH COMPENSATION AND ALONE) RESULTED IN A 99\% DROP IN LION KILLING.

MOOSE DENSITY INCREASED 45%, FROM 0.38 MOOSE/KM2 IN 2001 TO 0.55 MOOSE/KM2 IN 2007, WHICH RESULTED FROM ANNUAL INCREASES IN OVERALL SURVIVAL OF MOOSE, NOT INCREASES IN REPRODUCTIVE RATES. INDICES OF NUTRITIONAL STATUS REMAINED CONSTANT THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY DESPITE INCREASED MOOSE DENSITY.

THIS LOW RECRUITMENT COMBINED WITH LIBERAL ANTLERLESS DEER HARVEST HAS RESULTED IN DECLINES IN SOME DEER POPULATIONS, AND CONSEQUENTLY, INCREASED INTEREST IN COYOTE POPULATION CONTROL. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER NEONATE SURVIVAL INCREASED AFTER COYOTE REMOVAL, WHETHER COYOTE PREDATION ON NEONATES WAS ADDITIVE TO OTHER MORTALITY SOURCES, AND WHETHER UNDERSTORY VEGETATION DENSITY AFFECTED NEONATE SURVIVAL. WE MONITORED NEONATE SURVIVAL FOR 4 YEARS PRIOR TO (2006-2009) AND 3 YEARS DURING (2010-2012) INTENSIVE COYOTE REMOVAL ON 3 32-KM2 UNITS ON THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S SAVANNAH RIVER SITE, SOUTH CAROLINA. WE REMOVED 474 COYOTES (1.63 COYOTES/KM2 PER UNIT PER YEAR), REDUCING COYOTE ABUNDANCE BY 78% FROM PRE-REMOVAL LEVELS. THE BEST MODEL (WI = 0.927) DESCRIBING SURVIVAL PROBABILITY AMONG 216 RADIO-COLLARED NEONATES INCLUDED A WITHIN-YEAR QUADRATIC TIME TREND VARIABLE, DATE OF BIRTH, REMOVAL TREATMENT, AND A VARYING REMOVAL YEAR EFFECT. UNDER THIS MODEL, SURVIVAL DIFFERED BETWEEN PRE-TREATMENT AND REMOVAL PERIODS AND IT DIFFERED AMONG YEARS DURING THE REMOVAL PERIOD, BEING &GT;100% GREATER THAN PRE-TREATMENT SURVIVAL (0.228) DURING THE FIRST REMOVAL YEAR (0.513), SIMILAR TO PRE-TREATMENT SURVIVAL DURING THE SECOND REMOVAL YEAR (0.202), AND INTERMEDIATE DURING THE THIRD REMOVAL YEAR (0.431). DESPITE AN INITIAL INCREASE, THE OVERALL EFFECT OF COYOTE REMOVAL ON NEONATE SURVIVAL WAS MODEST. MORTALITY RATE ATTRIBUTABLE TO COYOTE PREDATION WAS LOWEST DURING THE FIRST REMOVAL YEAR (0.357) WHEN SURVIVAL WAS GREATEST, BUT THE MORTALITY RATE FROM ALL OTHER CAUSES DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE PRE-TREATMENT PERIOD AND ANY YEAR DURING REMOVALS, INDICATING THAT COYOTE PREDATION ACTED AS AN ADDITIVE SOURCE OF MORTALITY. SURVIVAL PROBABILITY WAS NOT RELATED TO VEGETATION COVER, EITHER DIRECTLY OR IN INTERACTION WITH COYOTE ABUNDANCE. WHEN THE OBJECTIVE IS TO INCREASE THE RECRUITMENT OF WHITE-TAILED DEER, WE CONCLUDE THAT NEITHER COYOTE CONTROL NOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT APPEAR EFFECTIVE.

DATA ON 421 INDIVIDUALS OF 12 SPECIES SHOWED THAT RESTORED GRASSLANDS WERE SIMILAR TO CROPLANDS AND NATURAL GRASSLANDS IN SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE AND COMPOSITION. AT THE LOCAL SCALE, MANAGEMENT INFLUENCED ABUNDANCE BECAUSE THERE WERE MORE SMALL MAMMALS IN UNMANAGED AND EARLY-MOWN GRASSLANDS WITH TALLER VEGETATION THAN IN LATE-MOWN OR GRAZED GRASSLANDS WITH LOWER VEGETATION, OR IN PLOUGHED CROPLANDS. ELEVATION WAS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE SITES AT HIGHER ELEVATION PROVIDED REFUGES DURING SPRING FLOODS OR SUMMER DROUGHTS. AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE, THE PROPORTION OF RESTORED AND NATURAL GRASSLANDS POSITIVELY AFFECTED THE ABUNDANCE OF SMALL MAMMALS, WHEREAS THE PROPORTION OF LINEAR HABITATS (ROADS, CANALS) HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON ABUNDANCE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT MANAGEMENT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN RESTORATION PER SE AT THE LOCAL SCALE, WHICH IS EXPECTED FOR HABITAT GENERALISTS SUCH AS SMALL MAMMALS IN CONTRAST TO SPECIALISTS SUCH AS PLANT-FEEDING INVERTEBRATES. HOWEVER, RESTORATION PROVIDES LANDSCAPE-SCALE BENEFITS BY INCREASING THE AREA OF GRASSLANDS THAT CAN SERVE AS REFUGES FOR SMALL MAMMALS IN UNFAVOURABLE PERIODS.

CAPTURE OF NONTARGET SPECIES IS AN INHERENT SIDE-EFFECT OF TRAPPING ANIMALS THAT IS INEFFICIENT AND POTENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL TO INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS. REDUCING RECAPTURE OF NONTARGET SPECIES WILL INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF LONG-TERM STUDIES AND PROJECTS, AND MINIMIZE UNWANTED IMPACTS. 2. DURING THE INITIAL STAGES OF A 3-YEAR FERAL CAT FELIS CATUS CONTROL PROGRAMME ON SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND, CALIFORNIA, USA, WE EXPERIENCED HIGH RECAPTURE RATES OF NONTARGET ENDANGERED SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND FOXES UROCYON LITTORALIS CLEMENTAE, IMPACTING PROJECT EFFICIENCY AND POTENTIALLY FOXES. 3. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER WE COULD MODIFY OUR BAITING STRATEGY TO REDUCE FOX RECAPTURES USING BEHAVIOURAL MODIFICATION TECHNIQUES, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAINTAINING THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE FERAL CATS. WE TESTED TWO STRATEGIES, AVERSIVE CONDITIONING AND REWARD REMOVAL, TO REDUCE FOX RECAPTURE RATES. 4. USING LITHIUM CHLORIDE (LC) AS AN AVERSIVE AGENT, WE REDUCED FOX RECAPTURE RATES MORE THAN 10 TIMES COMPARED WITH RATES USING CONTROL BAIT. USING THE REWARD REMOVAL TECHNIQUE, WE REDUCED FOX RECAPTURE RATES ALMOST 20 TIMES COMPARED WITH CONTROL BAITS. NEITHER BEHAVIOURAL MODIFICATION TECHNIQUE DETERRED CATS FROM ENTERING TRAPS, AND OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT BY REDUCING FOX RECAPTURES, WE IMPROVED OUR ABILITY TO CAPTURE CATS. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THESE NOVEL BAITING STRATEGIES HAVE WIDE APPLICABILITY IN WILDLIFE RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT. THE EFFICIENCY OF LONG-TERM MONITORING OR CONTROL PROGRAMMES MAY BE ENHANCED BY DISCOURAGING RECAPTURE OF `TRAP HAPPY' ANIMALS. POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO THREATENED SPECIES CONFINED IN TRAPS COULD BE MINIMIZED BY REDUCING RECAPTURES. SAMPLING OF RARE SPECIES IN BIODIVERSITY STUDIES COULD BE IMPROVED BY REDUCING RECAPTURE OF COMPETITIVELY SUPERIOR OR NUMERICALLY DOMINANT SPECIES.",2

WE USED LOCATION DATA OF REINTRODUCED FERRETS FROM 3 SITES IN SOUTH DAKOTA TO DETERMINE WHETHER EXPOSURE TO LANDSCAPE FEATURES TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH PREDATORS AFFECTED SURVIVAL OF FERRETS, AND WHETHER FERRETS CONSIDERED PREDATION RISK WHEN CHOOSING HABITAT NEAR PERCHES POTENTIALLY USED BY OWLS OR NEAR LINEAR FEATURES PREDICTED TO BE USED BY COYOTES. EXPOSURE TO AREAS NEAR LIKELY OWL PERCHES REDUCED FERRET SURVIVAL, BUT LANDSCAPE FEATURES POTENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH COYOTE MOVEMENTS HAD NO APPRECIABLE EFFECT ON SURVIVAL. FERRETS WERE LOCATED WITHIN 90 M OF PERCHES MORE THAN EXPECTED IN 2 STUDY SITES THAT ALSO HAD HIGHER FERRET MORTALITY DUE TO OWL PREDATION. DENSITIES OF POTENTIAL COYOTE TRAVEL ROUTES NEAR FERRET LOCATIONS WERE NO DIFFERENT THAN EXPECTED IN ALL 3 SITES.

ALTHOUGH TRAPPING HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO ATTEMPT TO CONTROL MINK, MANAGERS HAVE LITTLE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF ITS EFFECT ON MINK DENSITY OR DISTRIBUTION, PARTICULARLY WHERE IMMIGRATION OF MINK FROM NEARBY AREAS IS INEVITABLE. SUCH EVIDENCE IS NEEDED TO JUSTIFY THE USE OF LETHAL METHODS IN CONSERVATION POLICY. DURING 2006-2010 WE REMOVED MINK FROM THE RIVER MONNOW CATCHMENT IN WESTERN BRITAIN, USING TRACK-RECORDING RAFTS TO MONITOR CONTINUOUSLY FOR MINK PRESENCE, GUIDING A STRATEGIC TRAPPING EFFORT. THE AREA MONITORED AND TRAPPED WAS INCREASED IN STAGES, FROM A CORE SUB-CATCHMENT WITH 109 KM OF WATER-COURSE IN 2006, TO A 421-KM2 CATCHMENT WITH 203 KM OF WATER-COURSE IN 2009. IN EACH SUCCESSIVE SUB-CATCHMENT, MINK DETECTION AND CAPTURE RATES DECLINED RAPIDLY TO NEAR-ZERO LEVELS AFTER TRAPPING BEGAN. DETECTIONS AND CAPTURES SHOWED SEASONAL PEAKS IN EVERY YEAR CORRESPONDING TO KNOWN DISPERSAL PERIODS, BUT ALSO DECLINED STEADILY FROM YEAR TO YEAR, WITH INCREASING PERIODS IN WHICH WE DID NOT DETECT MINK. THESE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT EACH SUB-CATCHMENT WAS CLEARED OF MINK WITHIN A FEW MONTHS, WITH SUBSEQUENT CAPTURES ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMMIGRATION. ON AVERAGE, WE DETECTED EACH MINK 5.1 TIMES BEFORE CAPTURE (DAILY PROBABILITY OF DETECTION = 0.059 PER MINK AND RAFT), AND TRAPPED THEM 3.4 DAYS AFTER DEPLOYING TRAPS IN RESPONSE.

AIMS THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFECT OF REARING METHOD ON SURVIVAL AND BODY MASS OF CAPTIVE-RAISED TASMANIAN DEVILS (SARCOPHILUS HARRISII) FOLLOWING RELEASE ON AN OFFSHORE ISLAND. WE ALSO COMPARED THE POST-RELEASE DIET OF THESE DEVILS WITH THE DIET OF WILD DEVILS ON MAINLAND TASMANIA, WHERE A SIMILAR ARRAY OF DIET ITEMS IS AVAILABLE. METHODS TWENTY-EIGHT CAPTIVE-RAISED DEVILS WERE RELEASED ONTO THE ISLAND; 19 HAD BEEN RAISED IN INTENSIVE CAPTIVE-MANAGEMENT FACILITIES (IC) AND NINE IN FREE-RANGE (22 HA) ENCLOSURES (FRE). SURVIVAL AND BODY-MASS CHANGE WERE COMPARED BETWEEN IC AND FRE FOR UP TO 440 DAYS POST-RELEASE. DEVIL DIET WAS ASSESSED VIA SCAT ANALYSIS. KEY RESULTS A HIGH PROPORTION (96%) OF THE FOUNDERS SURVIVED 1 YEAR POST-RELEASE. PRE-RELEASE CAPTIVE-REARING METHOD HAD NO EFFECT. RELEASED DEVILS GAINED AN AVERAGE OF 14% OF THEIR ORIGINAL BODY MASS, IRRESPECTIVE OF CAPTIVE-REARING METHOD. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE DIET OF CAPTIVE-REARED DEVILS RELEASED ONTO MARIA ISLAND RELATIVE TO WILD MAINLAND DEVILS: TASMANIAN PADEMELON, THYLOGALE BILLARDIERII, WAS THE PRIMARY FOOD ITEM FOR BOTH. CONCLUSIONS THE INTENSITY OF CAPTIVE REARING DID NOT AFFECT THE SURVIVAL OF DEVILS RELEASED ONTO MARIA ISLAND. THIS SUGGESTS THAT EVEN DEVILS HELD IN IC FACILITIES RETAIN THE INNATE BEHAVIOUR REQUIRED TO SCAVENGE AND HUNT PREY, AND THEREFORE MAINTAIN BODYWEIGHT POST-RELEASE. THE LACK OF ANY THREATENING PROCESSES ON THE ISLAND IS ALSO LIKELY TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE HIGH SURVIVAL RATE 2 YEARS POST-RELEASE.

TO DO SO, WE STUDIED ABUNDANCES OF THIS SPECIES IN FOUR TYPES OF PLOTS DURING THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS AFTER A WILDFIRE IN CATALONIA (NE SPAIN): (A) UNBURNT FORESTS, (B) BURNT FORESTS WITH REMOVAL OF BURNT TREES BUT WITH BRANCHES LEFT, (C) BURNT FORESTS WITH REMOVAL OF BURNT TREES AND BRANCHES, AND (D) NON-FORESTED BURNT PLOTS. RABBITS PROGRESSIVELY COLONISED BURNT PLOTS, WHERE THEIR ABUNDANCE INCREASED FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS AFTER THE FIRE, BUT DECREASED OR EVEN DISAPPEARED IN UNBURNT ONES, INDICATING THAT FOREST FIRES HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON RABBIT POPULATIONS. ALTHOUGH ABUNDANCES DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE THREE BURNT PLOT TYPES, PLOTS WITH REMOVAL OF BURNT BRANCHES HAD THE HIGHEST INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE. IN ADDITION, SOIL COVERED BY BRANCHES OR BY DENSE VEGETATION APPEARED NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH ABUNDANCE, INDICATING THAT THIS COULD HINDER RABBIT MOVEMENTS, WHILE SOME PLANT SPECIES COULD BENEFIT RABBITS BY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY FOOD.

HOWEVER, THE ABILITY OF CROSSING STRUCTURES TO ALLOW INDIVIDUAL AND POPULATION-LEVEL MOVEMENTS ACROSS ROAD NETWORKS REMAINS UNKNOWN. IN APRIL 2006, WE INITIATED A 3-YEAR INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER CROSSING STRUCTURES PROVIDE DEMOGRAPHIC CONNECTIVITY FOR GRIZZLY AND BLACK BEARS IN BANFF NATIONAL PARK. WE COLLECTED HAIR WITH MULTIPLE NONINVASIVE METHODS TO OBTAIN GENETIC SAMPLES FROM GRIZZLY AND BLACK BEARS AROUND THE BOW VALLEY. OUR OBJECTIVES WERE TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF MALE AND FEMALE GRIZZLY AND BLACK BEARS THAT USE CROSSING STRUCTURES; EXAMINE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF CROSSINGS; AND ESTIMATE THE PROPORTIONS OF GRIZZLY AND BLACK BEAR POPULATIONS IN THE BOW VALLEY THAT USE CROSSING STRUCTURES. FIFTEEN GRIZZLY (7 FEMALE, 8 MALE) AND 17 BLACK BEARS (8 FEMALE, 9 MALE) USED WILDLIFE CROSSING STRUCTURES. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS DETECTED AT WILDLIFE CROSSING STRUCTURES WAS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE NUMBER OF PASSAGES IN SPACE AND TIME. GRIZZLY BEARS USED OPEN CROSSING STRUCTURES (E.G., OVERPASSES) MORE OFTEN THAN CONSTRICTED CROSSINGS (E.G., CULVERTS). PEAK USE OF CROSSING STRUCTURES FOR BOTH BEAR SPECIES OCCURRED IN JULY, WHEN HIGH RATES OF FORAGING ACTIVITY COINCIDE WITH MATING SEASON. WE COMPARED THE NUMBER OF BEARS THAT USED CROSSINGS WITH ESTIMATES OF POPULATION ABUNDANCE FROM A RELATED STUDY AND DETERMINED THAT SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGES OF GRIZZLY (15.0\% IN 2006, 19.8\% IN 2008) AND BLACK BEAR (17.6\% IN 2006, 11.0\% IN 2008) POPULATIONS USED CROSSING STRUCTURES.

PASSAGE RATES OF DEER APPROACHING UNDERPASSES STEADILY INCREASED FROM 54% IN YEAR 1 TO 92% IN YEAR 3. PEAK MOVEMENTS DURING THE AUTUMN MIGRATION OCCURRED IN MID-DECEMBER, WHILE PEAK SPRING MOVEMENTS WERE IN MID-MARCH AND EARLY MAY. UNDERPASS AND FENCE INSTALLATION EFFECTIVELY REDUCED DVCS BY 81%.

IN THIS AREA, ECONOMIC SUBSIDIES AND FREE TRANSPORTATION FROM THE OIL COMPANIES, ACCESS TO THE ROAD, MORE EFFICIENT HUNTING TECHNOLOGIES, AND MARKET INCENTIVES HAVE INCREASED THE IMPACTS OF HUNTING BY THE WAORANI, RESULTING IN DEPLETION OF THE LOCAL WILDLIFE POPULATIONS. OUR RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT CONSTRUCTION OF ROADS IN OIL EXTRACTION AREAS MUST BE AVOIDED IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. THE ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT OF CONTROLLING ACCESS CAN BE EFFECTIVE FOR SHORT-TERM HABITAT PROTECTION, BUT NOT FOR WILDLIFE CONSERVATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN OIL INDUSTRY PRACTICES ALTER THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF LOCAL INDIGENOUS GROUPS.",1

HERE WE EXAMINED THE REINTRODUCTION OF BROWN BEARS INTO THE ITALIAN ALPS. THE MAJORITY OF BEARS RELEASED (10 INDIVIDUALS) ADAPTED WELL TO THE RELEASE AREA AND THIS RESULTED IN THE INCREASE OF THE BROWN BEAR POPULATION.

OPERATIONS TO RESTORE CONIFER PLANTATIONS ON ANCIENT WOODLAND SITES (PAWS) WITH NATIVE BROADLEAVES MAY BE ESPECIALLY HAZARDOUS TO DORMICE POPULATIONS, SINCE DORMOUSE DENSITIES ARE GENERALLY LOWER HERE SO SUDDEN PERTURBATIONS MAY CAUSE LOCAL EXTINCTION. RECENT POLICY FOR RESTORING PAWS TO BROADLEAVED AND THE NEED TO COMPLY WITH EUROPEAN LEGISLATION HAS EMPHASISED THE NEED TO DEVISE APPROPRIATE BUT PRAGMATIC FOREST MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS INVOLVING THE PHASED REMOVAL OF CONIFERS OVER TIME. DORMICE WERE HANDLED AND INDIVIDUALLY MARKED ON A SINGLE 12 HA CONIFER PAWS SITE FROM 2000 AND A DENSITY INDEX CALCULATED FROM 2002 TO 2007. IN FOUR ADJACENT STUDY AREAS, A DIFFERENT FORM OF PAWS RESTORATION WAS CARRIED OUT IN 2003 TO REMOVE C. 33% OF CONIFERS.

LIVESTOCK GUARDIAN DOGS (LGDS) MAY BE ABLE TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE PREDATION, BUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN AUSTRALIAN GRAZING SYSTEMS HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATED. IN PARTICULAR, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LGDS IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY RANGE FREELY OVER LARGE AREAS IN COMPANY WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF LIVESTOCK. AIMS WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LGDS AS CURRENTLY USED IN AUSTRALIA AND DETERMINE THE FACTORS INFLUENCING EFFECTIVENESS, IN PARTICULAR IN RELATION TO SCALE OF MANAGEMENT. WE ALSO DOCUMENTED HOW LGDS ARE MANAGED IN AUSTRALIA, EVALUATED THEIR COST EFFECTIVENESS, AND IDENTIFIED FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE NUMBER OF DOGS REQUIRED IN DIFFERENT PROPERTY SITUATIONS. METHODS WE CONDUCTED A TELEPHONE SURVEY OF 150 LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS WITH LGDS IN AUSTRALIA, INCLUDING ALL LIVESTOCK TYPES AND PROPERTY SITUATIONS, IN ALL STATES. TEN PRODUCERS WERE VISITED, OF WHICH ONE IS DETAILED AS A CASE STUDY. KEY RESULTS EFFECTIVENESS WAS APPARENTLY HIGH: 65.7% OF RESPONDENTS REPORTED THAT PREDATION CEASED AFTER OBTAINING LGDS, AND A FURTHER 30.2% REPORTED A DECREASE OF PREDATION. WHEN THE NUMBER OF STOCK PER DOG EXCEEDS 100, LGDS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE ALL PREDATION. DOGS ARE OFTEN KEPT FREE-RANGING ON LARGE PROPERTIES WHERE WILD DOGS ARE THE MAIN PREDATOR, BUT ARE USUALLY RESTRICTED IN THEIR MOVEMENTS ON SMALLER PROPERTIES OR WITH SMALLER PREDATORS. THE COST OF OBTAINING A LGD IS RETURNED WITHIN 1–3 YEARS AFTER THE DOG STARTS WORKING. THE NUMBER OF DOGS REQUIRED FOR A PROPERTY MAINLY DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF LIVESTOCK NEEDING PROTECTION, AND THE MAIN TYPE OF PREDATOR IN THE AREA. CONCLUSIONS PROVIDED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF LGDS ARE USED, THEY CAN BE AS EFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING LIVESTOCK FROM PREDATORS IN AUSTRALIA WHEN RANGING FREELY ON LARGE PROPERTIES WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF LIVESTOCK AS THEY ARE IN SMALL-SCALE FARMING SYSTEMS. IMPLICATIONS LGDS CAN PROVIDE A COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL PREDATOR CONTROL METHODS IN AUSTRALIA’S EXTENSIVE GRAZING ENTERPRISES, POTENTIALLY REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR OTHER FORMS OF CONTROL.

ALL INDIVIDUALS RELEASED CLOSE TO THEIR CAPTURE SITE (=100 M) REMAINED ALIVE, WHILE MORTALITY REACHED 22 % AT LONGER TRANSLOCATION DISTANCES, PRINCIPALLY AS A RESULT OF FIGHTING BETWEEN RODENTS.

ALTHOUGH CONSERVATION EFFORTS ARE EMERGING TO REVERSE THE DECLINE OF NEW ENGLAND COTTONTAILS, MOST ARE DIRECTED TOWARD IMPROVING LONG-TERM VIABILITY BY INCREASING THE ABUNDANCE OF SUITABLE HABITATS. SUCH EFFORTS DO LITTLE TO IMPROVE THE SHORT-TERM SURVIVAL OF REMAINING COTTONTAILS. TO ADDRESS THIS IMMEDIATE NEED, WE EVALUATED THE USE OF SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD AS AN APPROACH TO IMPROVE OVER-WINTER SURVIVAL RATES. WE SPECULATED THAT BY POSITIONING FEEDERS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ESCAPE COVER, RABBITS WOULD BE LESS VULNERABLE TO PREDATORS. WE EVALUATED THIS APPROACH USING EASTERN COTTONTAILS (SYLVILAGUS FLORIDANUS) AS A RESEARCH SURROGATE BECAUSE THIS SPECIES IS READILY AVAILABLE AND HAS SIMILAR HABITAT REQUIREMENTS TO NEW ENGLAND COTTONTAILS. TRANSMITTER-EQUIPPED EASTERN COTTONTAILS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER A FED OR UNFED GROUP. REMOTELY-TRIGGERED CAMERAS WERE ALSO USED TO GAUGE USE OF FEEDERS BY COTTONTAILS AND VISITS BY OTHER SPECIES. WINTER SURVIVAL RATES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FOR FED RABBITS (70\%) THAN FOR UNFED RABBITS (32\%). CAMERAS REVEALED THAT RABBITS WERE THE MOST FREQUENT CONSUMER AND THAT THERE WAS ONLY LIMITED CARNIVORE ACTIVITY NEAR FEEDERS. WE CONCLUDE THAT SUPPLEMENTAL FEEDING MAY IMPROVE SURVIVAL OF REMAINING NEW ENGLAND COTTONTAILS AS EFFORTS TO INCREASE HABITAT AVAILABILITY CONTINUE TO DEVELOP. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER LTD.

SUPPLEMENTAL FEEDING OF BROWN BEARS URSUS ARCTOS IS A COMMON PRACTICE IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, BUT THE EFFECTS OF THIS CONTROVERSIAL AND EXPENSIVE MANAGEMENT MEASURE ON BEAR DIET AND BEHAVIOUR ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE ANALYSED 714 BROWN BEAR SCATS COLLECTED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IN THREE REGIONS OF SLOVENIA WITH DIFFERENT DENSITIES OF SUPPLEMENTAL FEEDING SITES. SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD CATEGORY IN THE BEAR DIET AND REPRESENTED 34% OF THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED DIETARY ENERGY CONTENT (MAIZE: 22%, LIVESTOCK CARRION: 12%). THE PROPORTION OF SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD IN THE DIET VARIED WITH SEASON AND REGION, BEING HIGHEST IN SPRING AND IN THE REGION WITH THE HIGHEST DENSITY OF FEEDING SITES.

HOWEVER, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT OTHER SPECIES ARE MONITORED DURING RESTORATION. SMALL MAMMALS, DUE TO THEIR IMPORTANCE IN ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION, ARE PARTICULARLY USEFUL TO STUDY. THE UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING AN OAK SAVANNA RESTORATION IN THE MANISTEE NATIONAL FOREST IN LOWER MICHIGAN USING FOREST THINNING AND PRESCRIBED BURNING. TO UNDERSTAND MANAGEMENT IMPACTS ON SMALL MAMMAL COMMUNITIES, WE LIVE TRAPPED SMALL MAMMALS IN EACH OF THE MECHANICALLY THINNED PLOTS (I.E., BULLDOZER, MASTICATOR, AND SHEAR CUTTER) AND CONTROL PLOTS IN FIVE BLOCKS OVER SIX YEARS (2008-2013), AS WELL AS MEASURED VEGETATION VARIABLES EACH YEAR. INITIALLY, WE USED A PERMUTATION MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (PERMANOVA) TO DETERMINE IF THERE WERE TREATMENT AND YEAR INTERACTIONS FOR BOTH SMALL MAMMAL COMMUNITY ASSEMBLAGES AND VEGETATION VARIABLES. WE THEN COMPARED CHANGES IN SMALL MAMMAL DIVERSITY, RELATIVE ABUNDANCE, AND VEGETATION VARIABLES AMONG TREATMENTS USING EXPLORATORY RANDOMIZED BLOCK DESIGN ANALYSIS OF VARIANCES (ANOVAS). CANOPY COVER WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN BULLDOZER AND SHEAR CUTTER THINNED PLOTS THAN CONTROL PLOTS FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THINNING.

THIS SITUATION OFFERED AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF PREVENTATIVE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS SUCH AS DIVERSIONARY FEEDING AND LETHAL REMOVAL OF PREDATORS FOR IMPROVING CALF SURVIVAL.

CALF SURVIVAL WAS NEARLY CONSTANT OVER THE 6-YEAR STUDY PERIOD ON THE UNTREATED AREAS. CALF SURVIVAL WAS INITIALLY LOWER ON THE TREATMENT AREA COMPARED TO THE UNTREATED AREAS BUT INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY ON THE TREATMENT AREA DURING THE LETHAL REMOVAL PERIOD, ESPECIALLY DURING THE INITIAL 70-DAY PERIOD. PREDATION ON CALVES BY COYOTE DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY DURING THE LETHAL REMOVAL PERIOD. DIVERSIONARY FEEDING HAD LITTLE INFLUENCE ON SURVIVAL RATES.

OUR ANALYSES FOCUSED ON THE COMMON BRUSHTAIL POSSUM TRICHOSURUS VULPECULA AND COMMON RINGTAIL POSSUM PSEUDOCHEIRUS PEREGRINUS.

PLANTINGS WERE NOT OCCUPIED BY EITHER SPECIES AT THE OUTSET OF OUR INVESTIGATION AND WERE RARELY COLONIZED THROUGHOUT THE SUBSEQUENT 10YEARS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT A LACK OF SHELTER SITES IN LARGE OLD HOLLOW-BEARING TREES IS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS LIMITING THE OCCURRENCE OF PLANTINGS BY CAVITY-DEPENDENT ARBOREAL MARSUPIALS, SUGGESTING A LAG BETWEEN PLANTING ESTABLISHMENT AND THE TIME REQUIRED FOR PLANTINGS TO BECOME SUITABLE HABITAT.

UNEXPECTEDLY, COLONIZATION PROBABILITY WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY A TEMPORAL INCREASE IN WOODY VEGETATION COVER SURROUNDING A PATCH. A PAUCITY OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PATCH COLONIZATION AND THE TEMPORAL CHANGE IN VEGETATION COVER MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE INCREASED VEGETATION COVER IN OUR STUDY LANDSCAPES OVER THE PAST DECADE HAS RESULTED FROM ESTABLISHMENT OF PLANTINGS WHICH ARE GENERALLY NOT SUITABLE NESTING HABITAT FOR ARBOREAL MARSUPIALS. OUR FINDINGS HAVE KEY MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS SUCH AS EMPHASIZING THE VALUE OF OLD GROWTH WOODLAND FOR ARBOREAL MARSUPIALS AND OF TARGETING RESTORATION EFFORTS AROUND OLD GROWTH AND REGROWTH WOODLAND PATCHES, AND THE FLAWED NOTION OF BIODIVERSITY OFFSETS THAT ALLOW REPLANTINGS TO COMPENSATE FOR CLEARING OLD GROWTH WOODLAND.",1

HERE WE USE A KOALA (PHASCOLARCTOS CINEREUS) TRANSLOCATION PROGRAM FROM SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA AS A CASE STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF TRANSLOCATION ON INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS. THE KOALA IS AN ICONIC SPECIES THAT OCCURS AT HIGH DENSITIES IN SOME PARTS OF ITS SOUTHERN RANGE, LEADING TO NUMEROUS CONSERVATION AND ANIMAL WELFARE ISSUES.

ANNUAL POST-TRANSLOCATION SURVEYS AT RELEASE SITES REVEALED DENSITIES OF Â&0.4 KOALAS/HA, DESPITE RELEASE DENSITIES OF 1.0 KOALA/HA. RADIOTRACKING STUDIES INDICATE THAT LOW DENSITIES WERE BECAUSE OF BOTH MORTALITY AND HIGH DISPERSAL OF TRANSLOCATED INDIVIDUALS.

SEVERAL PAST STUDIES HAVE MONITORED THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL BREEDING STRUCTURES IN THE WILD, BUT VIRTUALLY NONE OF THEM HAVE INVESTIGATED WHICH DEMOGRAPHIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ACTUALLY DETERMINE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN FACILITATING REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY THOSE FACTORS INFLUENCING BREEDING SUCCESS IN ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES. WITH THIS PURPOSE WE SURVEYED A DECLINING POPULATION OF A KEYSTONE SPECIES OF MEDITERRANEAN ECOSYSTEMS, NAMELY THE EUROPEAN WILD RABBIT. IN DONANA NATIONAL PARK, WE SAMPLED DURING THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS THE BREEDING SUCCESS OF WILD RABBITS FROM 47 ARTIFICIAL WARRENS, EXPERIMENTALLY PROVIDED UNDER DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH FACTORS, WE APPLIED AN AIC MODEL SELECTION PROCEDURE TO ALTERNATIVE BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS GROUPS, POSTULATING THAT BREEDING SUCCESS IN ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES WOULD PRIMARILY DEPEND ON POPULATION DENSITY, FOOD AVAILABILITY AND/OR PREDATOR LIMITATION. WE FOUND THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF ARTIFICIAL WARRENS IN FACILITATING RABBIT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS CAN VARY, WITH AN INCREASE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER PASTURE AVAILABILITY. PREDATOR LIMITATION BY FENCING ALSO POSITIVELY AFFECTED RABBIT REPRODUCTION, BUT ONLY IN COMBINATION WITH HIGH PASTURE AVAILABILITY. ON THEIR OWN, FENCING TREATMENT AND POPULATION REINFORCEMENTS HAD LOW AND NULL EFFECTIVENESS FACILITATING REPRODUCTION, RESPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS ENTAILING SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND BIOLOGICAL COSTS. THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE BREEDING SUCCESS IN ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES, THEREFORE, WAS THROUGH THEIR STRATEGIC PLACEMENT IN POTENTIAL HIGH-QUALITY HABITATS, I.E. WITH SUITABLE PASTURE AVAILABILITY. WE SUGGEST THAT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT CAN EFFECTIVELY INCREASE CARRYING CAPACITY AND CONSEQUENTLY THE TARGET SPECIES' REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, ESPECIALLY IN FAST BREEDING SPECIES LIKE THE EUROPEAN WILD RABBIT. THE PROVISION OF ARTIFICIAL BREEDING STRUCTURES FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFIT FROM THE ELABORATION OF CONCURRENT EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES SIMILAR TO THE PRESENT RESEARCH, WHICH CAN HELP ESTABLISH USEFUL GUIDELINES FOR OPTIMIZING FUTURE CONSERVATION EFFORTS.

THERE IS EXTENSIVE PUBLIC FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR RESTORATION AND LAND CARE ACTIVITIES. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT CERTAIN TREES RAPIDLY PROVIDE KOALA HABITAT WHEN PLANTED ON FARMS AND THAT THE FIRST PRIORITY SHOULD BE RESTORING SITES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO KNOWN KOALA POPULATIONS.

THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATION CREDITS SCHEME IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAMME INTRODUCED IN 2008, DESIGNED TO REDUCE MORTALITY AND DISCARDING OF COD IN LINE WITH EU COMMON FISHERIES POLICY MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES. THE SCHEME WAS EXPANDED IN 2009, BUILDING ON THE INITIAL ELEMENTS OF REAL-TIME CLOSURES (RTCS) AND GEAR REQUIREMENTS. VARIOUS MEASURES WERE AGREED IN A CO-MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK INVOLVING FISHERS, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND SCIENTISTS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO ENCOURAGE COD AVOIDANCE AND THE REDUCTION OF COD DISCARDS USING SPATIAL TOOLS SUCH AS RTCS AND SEASONAL CLOSURES, ALONG WITH GEAR OPTIONS THAT REDUCE COD CAPTURE. THE SCHEME WAS INCENTIVIZED BY REWARDING PARTICIPATION WITH ADDITIONAL DAYS AT SEA. REAL-TIME MONITORING WAS CARRIED OUT WITH EXTENSIVE USE OF FISHERY-DEPENDENT INFORMATION, ALLOWING MANAGEMENT TO BE ADAPTED AS REQUIRED AND TO ADDRESS EMERGING PROBLEMS. THE USE OF VESSEL MONITORING SYSTEM DATA, LOGBOOK RECORDS, FISHERS’ KNOWLEDGE, AND OBSERVER DATA IS DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING AND ASSESSING THE SCHEME. COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLOSURE ELEMENTS OF THE SCHEME WAS JUDGED TO HAVE BEEN GOOD, AND ESTIMATED CATCH RATES BY THE SCOTTISH FLEET MET TARGET CRITERIA, BUT THE ASSESSED CATCH SAVINGS OF COD FROM RTCS WERE LESS THAN PREDICTED. MODIFICATIONS TO THE SCHEME WERE INTRODUCED FOR 2010, REFLECTING IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE.",2

THIS STUDY CONDUCTED MARKET SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS TO EXAMINE IF THE CLOSED GROUPER SEASON IN 2009 HAD ANY EFFECT ON HERBIVORE SPEARFISHING CATCHES, OR CAUSED CHANGES IN THE TARGETING BEHAVIOUR OF FISHERS. CATCH VOLUMES OF THE MOST DESIRABLE HERBIVORES WERE UNAFFECTED BY THE GROUPER SEASON, BUT THE CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT OF HERBIVORES REGULARLY CAUGHT OPPORTUNISTICALLY (I.E. IF SEEN) OR AVOIDED RAISED BY 45% DURING THE GROUPER CLOSURE. THE SIZE COMPOSITION OF THE CATCH OF THE BLUESPINE UNICORNFISH NASO UNICORNIS DURING THE GROUPER CLOSURE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SKEWED TO SMALLER SIZED FISH DUE TO THE HIGH PROPORTION OF IMMATURE INDIVIDUALS. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED TO CLARIFY WHETHER THIS PATTERN EMERGED BECAUSE FISHERS HAD RELAXED SIZE SELECTIVITY DURING THE CLOSURE OR DUE TO A PAUCITY OF ADULTS IN JULY. FIFTY-SEVEN PER CENT OF THE INTERVIEWED FISHERS INDICATED THAT WHILE GROUPERS WOULD BE THEIR FIRST CHOICE DURING OPEN SEASON, N.UNICORNIS WOULD BECOME THEIR PREFERRED TARGET DURING THE CLOSURE, AND THAT OTHER HERBIVORES WERE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO BE TARGETED. THIS STUDY TOOK AN IMPORTANT STEP IN IDENTIFYING A FACTOR DRIVING SHORT AND ACUTE CHANGES IN THE HERBIVORE CATCH COMPOSITION. FURTHER EFFORTS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO QUANTIFY THE ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE OBSERVED CHANGES AND DETERMINE IF THESE ARE AGGRAVATED BY THE LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS OR FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF THE FOCAL SPECIES. RELAXED SPECIES SELECTIVITY MIGHT EMERGE ELSEWHERE, IF INHERENTLY SELECTIVE FISHING METHODS ARE USED AND HIGHLY PRIZED TARGETS ARE TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY BANNED, OR OVERFISHED TO CRITICAL LEVELS.

SEASONAL CLOSURES HAVE OFTEN BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN AN ATTEMPT TO ALLEVIATE SUCH IMPACTS BUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE MEASURES IS RARELY TESTED. THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SPAWNING CLOSURE FOR ATLANTIC COD (GADUS MORHUA) IN THE FIRTH OF CLYDE OFF THE SCOTTISH WEST COAST (ICES AREA VIA). THIS CLOSURE WAS INTRODUCED IN MARCH 2001 AS AN EMERGENCY MEASURE TO ALLOW AS MANY COD AS POSSIBLE TO SPAWN AND AVOID THE BUILD-UP OF DISPLACED EFFORT FROM ANOTHER SPAWNING CLOSURE. GENETIC, TAGGING, AND OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY INVESTIGATIONS INDICATE THAT COD INHABITING THE CLYDE ARE REPRODUCTIVELY ISOLATED FROM OTHER RESIDENT GROUPS IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PART OF THE SCOTTISH WEST COAST STOCK. THIS STUDY USED A BEYOND-BEFORE-AFTER, CONTROL-IMPACT APPROACH TO COMPARE POPULATION TRENDS OF THE CLYDE SPAWNING AGGREGATION BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTRODUCED AREA CLOSURE, USING TWO OTHER SUB-POPULATION SPAWNING GROUNDS AS CONTROL AREAS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF LOCAL RECOVERY IN TERMS OF ABUNDANCE, BIOMASS, OR REDUCED MORTALITY IN THE CLYDE MORE THAN A DECADE AFTER ESTABLISHING THE CLOSURE. MORTALITY MAY HAVE REMAINED HIGH BECAUSE YOUNG COD ARE STILL CAUGHT AS BYCATCH IN THE NEPHROPS FISHERY IN THE AREA AND THE PREDATION RATE MAY HAVE INCREASED DUE TO AN EXPANDING WHITING POPULATION. CONSIDERING THE STATE OF THE ALREADY SEVERELY DEPLETED CLYDE SUB-POPULATION WHEN THE CLOSURE WAS IMPLEMENTED THE MEASURE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN TOO LITTLE AND TOO LATE. THE TENDENCY TO IMPLEMENT SUCH SPAWNING CLOSURES ON NEARLY COLLAPSED STOCKS MAY BE WHY THESE MEASURES OFTEN APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE.",2

WEAK OR MISSING MANAGEMENT INSTITUTIONS, A LACK OF RESEARCH CAPACITY, AND THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THESE ECOSYSTEMS HAVE HERALDED A CALL FOR ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT APPROACHES. HOWEVER, ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT OF CORAL REEF FISHERIES HAS PROVED CHALLENGING DUE TO THE MULTISPECIES NATURE OF CATCHES AND THE DIVERSITY OF FISH FUNCTIONAL ROLES. WE USED DATA ON FISH COMMUNITIES COLLECTED FROM 233 INDIVIDUAL SITES IN 9 WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN COUNTRIES TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN THE SITE'S FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION AND ASSOCIATED LIFE-HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS ALONG A LARGE RANGE OF FISH BIOMASS. AS BIOMASS INCREASED ALONG THIS RANGE, FISH WERE LARGER AND GREW AND MATURED MORE SLOWLY WHILE THE ABUNDANCE OF SCRAPING AND PREDATORY SPECIES INCREASED. THE GREATEST CHANGES IN FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OCCURRED BELOW RELATIVELY LOW STANDING STOCK BIOMASS (<600 KG/HA); ABUNDANCES OF PISCIVORES, APEX PREDATORS, AND SCRAPING HERBIVORES WERE LOW AT VERY LIGHT LEVELS OF FISHING. THIS SUGGESTS POTENTIAL TRADE-OFFS IN ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION AND ESTIMATED YIELDS FOR DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. CURRENT FISHING GEAR AND AREA RESTRICTIONS ARE NOT ACHIEVING CONSERVATION TARGETS (PROPOSED HERE AS STANDING STOCK BIOMASS OF 1150 KG/HA) AND RESULT IN LOSSES OF LIFE HISTORY AND ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. FISH IN REEFS WHERE DESTRUCTIVE GEARS WERE RESTRICTED TYPICALLY HAD VERY SIMILAR BIOMASS AND FUNCTIONS TO YOUNG AND LOW COMPLIANCE CLOSURES. THIS INDICATES THE POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT ROLE OF FISHERIES RESTRICTIONS IN PROVIDING SOME GAINS IN BIOMASS AND ASSOCIATED ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS WHEN FULLY PROTECTED AREA ENFORCEMENT POTENTIAL IS LIMITED AND LIKELY TO FAIL. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT BIOMASS ALONE CAN PROVIDE BROAD ECOSYSTEM-BASED FISHERIES MANAGEMENT TARGETS THAT CAN BE EASILY APPLIED EVEN WHERE RESEARCH CAPACITY AND INFORMATION IS LIMITED. OF PARTICULAR VALUE, IS OUR FINDING THAT CURRENT MANAGEMENT TOOLS MAY BE USED TO REACH KEY ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT TARGETS, ENABLING ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT IN MANY SOCIOECONOMIC CONTEXTS.",1

WHILE MANY STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT MARINE SANCTUARIES INCREASE THE ABUNDANCE, DIVERSITY, AND TROPHIC LEVEL OF MARINE FISH COMMUNITIES, FEW HAVE COMPARED THESE PARAMETERS ACROSS MULTIPLE LEVELS OF PROTECTION AND HUMAN MODIFICATION. THIS STUDY UTILIZED BAITED REMOTE UNDERWATER VIDEO TO COMPARE FISH ASSEMBLAGES BETWEEN MARINE PARKS, BETWEEN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PROTECTION WITHIN PARKS (SANCTUARY AND HABITAT PROTECTION ZONES), AND BETWEEN PARKS AND HIGHLY MODIFIED SYSTEMS WITH SIMILAR ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES. IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT SANCTUARY ZONES HAVE HIGHER ABUNDANCE OF TARGETED FISH SPECIES COMPARED WITH OTHER AREAS WITHIN SOME MARINE PARKS. THE TOTAL ABUNDANCE OF TARGETED SPECIES AND ABUNDANCES OF SOME KEY FISHERIES SPECIES (E.G. PINK SNAPPER) WERE FOUND TO BE HIGHER IN SANCTUARY ZONES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT INCREASED PROTECTION MAY BE EFFECTIVE AT IMPROVING THESE ASPECTS OF THE FISH ASSEMBLAGE. HOWEVER, WHEN MARINE PARKS WERE COMPARED WITH HIGHLY MODIFIED ENVIRONMENTS IT WAS FOUND THAT TARGETED SPECIES WERE MUCH MORE ABUNDANT IN THE HIGHLY MODIFIED SYSTEMS. COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF ENTIRE FISH ASSEMBLAGES ALSO DIFFERED BETWEEN THESE LEVELS OF MODIFICATION AND ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT FISHERIES SPECIES CONTRIBUTED MOST TO THIS DIFFERENCE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT WHILE HIGHLY PROTECTED SANCTUARY ZONES MAY INCREASE THE ABUNDANCE OF TARGETED FISH COMPARED WITH LESS PROTECTED AREAS WITHIN THE SAME ESTUARY, HIGHLY INDUSTRIALIZED OR URBANIZED SYSTEMS, NOT TYPICALLY CHOSEN AS MARINE PARKS, MAY ACTUALLY SUPPORT MORE TARGETED SPECIES OF FISH.

MPA EFFECTS WERE STUDIED BY EMPLOYING A FIVE YEAR DATABASE COLLECTED BY A SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH VESSEL IN PROTECTED AND FISHING LOCATIONS, BEFORE AND AFTER THE MPA ESTABLISHMENT. WE ASSESSED 152 SCIENTIFIC TRAWLING STATIONS USING MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF FISH ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE, FISH ABUNDANCE (DISCRIMINATING TARGET AND NON-TARGET SPECIES), AND MEAN SIZE AND PROPORTION OF JUVENILES OF THE TARGET SPECIES (ARGENTINE HAKE, MERLUCCIUS HUBBSI). THE IDENTIFIED MPA EFFECTS WERE A TREND TOWARDS INCREASING ABUNDANCE OF THE DEMERSAL FISH ASSEMBLAGE, THE TARGET AND NON-TARGET FISH SPECIES, AND HAKE JUVENILE SIZE, AND A HIGHER PROPORTION OF JUVENILES AGED 2+ INSIDE THE MPA.

A TOTAL OF 8674 FISHES LANDED IN KARIMUNJAWA BY FISHERS USING FOUR ARTISANAL FISHING GEARS WERE EXAMINED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE CONDITION OF THE ARTISANAL FISHERY (STANDARD AND INFINITE FISH LENGTH, TROPHIC LEVEL AND WEIGHT) RELATED TO FISHING GEAR USE, VILLAGE FISHING GROUNDS, MANAGEMENT, HUMAN POPULATION SIZE, HUMAN POPULATION DENSITY AND ESTIMATED FISHING PRESSURE. DEPLETION IN FISH LENGTHS AND TROPHIC STRUCTURE WERE FOUND AT OR ABOVE 46 FISHING TRIPS DAY-1KM-2, SUGGESTING THAT FISHING PRESSURE IS A KEY FACTOR DRIVING FISHERY CATCH STRUCTURE.

MARINE PROTECTED AREAS (MPAS) ARE USED INCREASINGLY AS CONSERVATION TOOLS AROUND THE WORLD, BUT HOW THEY BENEFIT MOBILE AND WIDE RANGING SPECIES LIKE SHARKS REMAINS UNCLEAR. TO EVALUATE THE DEGREE OF PROTECTION MPAS MAY PROVIDE FOR SHARKS, WE USED AN ARRAY OF ACOUSTIC RECEIVERS TO EXAMINE THE MOVEMENTS AND SPATIAL USE OF TWO TROPICAL COASTAL SPECIES WITHIN TWO MPAS IN THE GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK, AUSTRALIA. JUVENILE PIGEYE (CARCHARHINUS AMBOINENSIS) AND ADULT SPOT-TAIL (CARCHARHINUS SORRAH) SHARKS WERE FITTED WITH ACOUSTIC TRANSMITTERS FROM 2009 TO 2010. BOTH SPECIES DISPLAYED LONG-TERM USE OF MPAS, WITH SOME INDIVIDUALS DETECTED FOR LONGER THAN 600 DAYS. THE MEAN PERCENTAGE OF TIME C. AMBOINENSIS AND C. SORRAH SPENT INSIDE MPAS WAS 22\% AND 32\%, RESPECTIVELY. MPA USE VARIED SEASONALLY, WITH C. AMBOINENSIS SPENDING A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF TIME INSIDE MPAS IN SUMMER (MEAN = 28\%) AND C. SORRAH SPENDING A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF TIME INSIDE MPAS IN WINTER (MEAN = 40\%). ALTHOUGH SHARKS USED LARGE AREAS INSIDE MPAS, MOST INDIVIDUALS TENDED TO USE ONLY HALF OF THE AVAILABLE PROTECTED SPACE. IN ADDITION, ALL SHARKS MADE EXCURSIONS FROM MPAS AND INDIVIDUALS EXITED AND RE-ENTERED AT CONSISTENT LOCATIONS ALONG THE MPA BOUNDARIES. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT MPAS HAVE CONSERVATION BENEFITS FOR SHARK POPULATIONS BY PROVIDING PROTECTION ACROSS DIFFERENT SPECIES AND LIFE STAGES, AND TRACKING STUDIES CAN BE USED TO HELP TAILOR MPA DESIGN TO MAXIMIZE EFFECTIVENESS.

BETWEEN 2005 AND 2014, RAYS WERE RECORDED IN 8.2% OF OBSERVED PURSE SEINE SETS. RAYS WERE CAUGHT DURING SUMMER, WITH A ‘HOTSPOT’ (24.3% OF SETS) NEAR THE SHELF EDGE OFF NORTH ISLAND OVER SEABED DEPTHS OF 150–350 M. RAYS WERE USUALLY BRAILED ABOARD WITH THE TUNA CATCH FROM SUCCESSFUL SETS, BUT WERE OFTEN ENTANGLED IN THE BUNT OF THE NET DURING UNSUCCESSFUL SETS. OBSERVERS TAGGED NINE RAYS WITH POPUP ARCHIVAL TAGS TO OBTAIN PRELIMINARY INFORMATION ON THEIR POST-RELEASE SURVIVAL, AND SPATIAL AND VERTICAL MOVEMENTS. SEVEN OF THE NINE TAGS REPORTED DATA, AND FOUR OF THOSE RAYS DIED WITHIN 2–4 DAYS OF RELEASE. ALL FOUR RAYS THAT DIED HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOARD ENTANGLED IN THE BUNT. THE THREE SURVIVING RAYS WERE ALL BRAILED ABOARD WITH THE TUNA CATCH. ONE SURVIVING RAY REMAINED NEAR NEW ZEALAND FOR 2.7 MONTHS DURING SUMMER, AND THE OTHER TWO MIGRATED 1400–1800 KM NORTHWARD TO TROPICAL WATERS NEAR VANUATU AND FIJI AT MINIMUM SPEEDS OF 47 AND 63 KM DAY-1 AT THE END OF SUMMER. ARCHIVE DATA FROM ONE RAY SHOWED THAT IT MADE REGULAR VERTICAL MOVEMENTS OF 25–100 M AMPLITUDE, BUT SPENT MOST OF ITS TIME SHALLOWER THAN 50 M, MORE SO DURING THE NIGHT (89.6%) THAN THE DAY (76.6%), AND MAINLY EXPERIENCED TEMPERATURES OF 18-22 °C. DIVES DEEPER THAN 200 M WERE USUALLY MADE DURING THE DAY OR TWILIGHT. ALL THREE SURVIVING RAYS TYPICALLY MOVED BETWEEN THE SURFACE AND 200–300 M DAILY, AND REACHED GREATEST DEPTHS OF 649 M, 1000 M AND 1112 M, RESPECTIVELY, SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDING THE PREVIOUS DEPTH RECORD FOR THIS SPECIES OF 445 M. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR REDUCING PURSE SEINE MORTALITY OF MOBULID RAYS BY AVOIDING AREAS OF HIGH RAY ABUNDANCE, AVOIDING SETTING ON RAY-ASSOCIATED TUNA SCHOOLS, AND ADOPTING BEST-PRACTICE METHODS OF RETURNING RAYS TO THE SEA FROM THE NET OR VESSEL.

WHALE SHARK, THE WORLD'S LARGEST FISH, IS BELIEVED TO BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE OWING TO ITS BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS (SLOW GROWTH, LATE MATURATION, GREAT LONGEVITY) AND IS LISTED AS VULNERABLE BY IUCN AND INCLUDED IN APPENDIX II OF CITES. 2. WHALE SHARKS ARE OCCASIONALLY ENCIRCLED IN TROPICAL TUNA PURSE-SEINE NETS, THROUGHOUT THIS GLOBAL FISHERY. ALTHOUGH APPARENT IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL RATES FOLLOWING ENCIRCLEMENT AND RELEASE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ASSESSED THROUGH SCIENTIFIC ONBOARD OBSERVER PROGRAMMES, A MORE RIGOROUS METHODOLOGY IS STILL REQUIRED FOR STUDYING POST-RELEASED SURVIVAL. 3. THIS WORK PROVIDES A METHOD FOR APPLYING POP-UP SATELLITE TAGS AND REPORTS AN ENHANCED RELEASE PROCEDURE FOR WHALE SHARKS. THE FIRST ASSESSMENT OF SURVIVAL AFTER RELEASE FROM PURSE-SEINE NETS INVOLVED SIX WHALE SHARKS TAGGED BETWEEN MAY AND SEPTEMBER 2014 IN THE EASTERN TROPICAL ATLANTIC OCEAN. FIVE TAGS TRANSMITTED DATA: THREE POPPED UP AS PROGRAMMED (AFTER 30 DAYS), WHILE TWO SURFACED PREMATURELY (ONE AFTER 21 AND THE OTHER AFTER 71 DAYS (PROGRAMMED TO POP OFF AFTER 30 AND 90 DAYS, RESPECTIVELY)) BUT SHOWED NO SIGN OF UNUSUAL BEHAVIOUR. 4. OVERALL, WHALE SHARKS SURVIVED AT LEAST 21 DAYS (ONE AT LEAST 71 DAYS) AFTER RELEASE FROM PURSE-SEINE NETS. THESE OBSERVATIONS BASED ON FIVE LARGE INDIVIDUALS (TOTAL LENGTH > 8 M), SUGGEST THAT WHALE SHARKS HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF SURVIVAL WHEN RELEASED WITH THE PROPOSED METHOD. 5. ADDITIONAL TAGGING IN THIS AND OTHER OCEANS, ESPECIALLY OF JUVENILES WHICH MAY BE MORE SENSITIVE TO ENCIRCLEMENT AND RELEASE OPERATIONS, IS ESSENTIAL TO FURTHER ASSESS WHALE SHARK POST-RELEASE SURVIVAL RATES IN TUNA PURSE-SEINE FISHERIES.

ALTHOUGH NOT A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO S. MOKARRAN MORTALITY, BEACH NETS ARE UTILIZED IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL HARMFUL INTERACTION BETWEEN SHARKS AND BEACHGOERS. TO ADDRESS THIS MORTALITY, PERMANENT MAGNETS HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE IF THESE MATERIALS CAN DETER SHARKS AWAY FROM NETTED AREAS. THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF BARIUM-FERRITE (BAFE12O19) PERMANENT MAGNETS ON S. MOKARRAN BEHAVIOR UNDER SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND BIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS. IN THE BAIT EXPERIMENT, FEEDING FREQUENCY SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND AVOIDANCE FREQUENCY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED WITH THE MAGNET TREATMENT, WITH EXPOSURE QUANTITY YIELDING AN INCREASE IN FEEDING FREQUENCY, ALTHOUGH THIS EFFECT WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. FOR THE BARRIER EXPERIMENT, ENTRANCE FREQUENCY SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND AVOIDANCE AND PASS-AROUND FREQUENCIES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED WITH THE MAGNET TREATMENT, WITH HETEROSPECIFIC DENSITY ALSO BEING A SIGNIFICANT PRE - DICTOR OF ENTRANCE FREQUENCY. THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE HOW PERMANENT MAGNETS CAN MODIFY S. MOKARRAN BEHAVIOR AND HOW THIS BEHAVIOR IS MODIFIED BASED ON SITUATIONAL CONTEXT. SINCE SEVERAL OTHER SPHYRNID SPECIES ARE CAUGHT IN BEACH NETS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN S. MOKARRAN (E.G. SCALLOPED HAMMERHEADS S.

PELAGIC FISHING AT SEAMOUNTS, WHERE HYPERSTABILITY OF PELAGIC PREDATORS MAY OCCUR, CAN EXACERBATE DECLINING ABUNDANCE AND HAVE HIGH BYCATCH OF SPECIES GROUPS THAT ARE HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO OVEREXPLOITATION. GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MIXED POISSON REGRESSION MODELS (GAMMS) WERE FITTED TO HAWAII LONGLINE TUNA FISHERY OBSERVER DATA TO DETERMINE TEMPORAL TRENDS IN STANDARDIZED CATCH RATES, AN INDEX FOR LOCAL, RELATIVE ABUNDANCE. TEMPORAL TRENDS IN EXPECTILE LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS WERE DETERMINED THROUGH GEOADDITIVE EXPECTILE GAMMS. SIGNIFICANT DECLINING TRENDS IN RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IN THIS FISHERY WERE OBSERVED FOR TUNAS, SHARKS AND BILLFISH. A DECLINE IN SEABIRD STANDARDIZED CATCH RATE OCCURRED CONCURRENTLY WITH THE UPTAKE OF SEABIRD BYCATCH MITIGATION TECHNOLOGY. CHANGED SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF FISHING EFFORT AND INCREASED USE OF WIDER CIRCLE HOOKS LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO A DECLINING SEA TURTLE STANDARDIZED CATCH RATE. TUNA AND BILLFISH MEAN LENGTHS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED OVER THE TIME SERIES DUE TO ENTIRE DISTRIBUTIONS OF LENGTH CLASSES HAVING SHIFTED TOWARDS LARGER FISH. LARGER TUNAS COMPRISED A LARGER PROPORTION OF THE CATCH DUE TO FEWER SMALL TUNAS BEING CAUGHT, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT BECAUSE MEAN LENGTHS OF LARGER SIZE CLASSES INCREASED. CONVERSELY, BILLFISH LARGEST LENGTH CLASSES EXPERIENCED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN AVERAGE LENGTHS. CHANGES IN SPATIAL AND SEASONAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF FISHING EFFORT, INCREASED USE OF WIDER CIRCLE HOOKS, AND POSSIBLY INCREASING PURSE SEINE SELECTIVE REMOVALS OF JUVENILE TUNAS, MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED SELECTIVITY FOR LARGER FISH. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN STANDARDIZED CATCH RATES AND LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS AT A SHALLOW SEAMOUNT VS. THE OPEN OCEAN CONFIRMS THE AGGREGATING EFFECT OF SEAMOUNTS ON PELAGIC PREDATORS, INCLUDING JUVENILE MARKET SPECIES OF PELAGIC FISH AND SPECIES GROUPS RELATIVELY VULNERABLE TO OVEREXPLOITATION.

IN TOTAL, 310 LONGLINE EXPERIMENTAL SETS (446 400 HOOKS) WERE DEPLOYED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2008 AND FEBRUARY 2012. THREE DIFFERENT HOOK STYLES WERE TESTED; THE TRADITIONAL J-HOOK (9/0) 10O OFFSET WAS COMPARED WITH TWO 17/0 CIRCLE HOOKS (A NON-OFFSET AND A 10O OFFSET), AND SQUID (ILLEX SPP.) BAIT WAS COMPARED WITH MACKEREL (SCOMBER SPP.). CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT (CPUE) WAS CALCULATED FOR EACH FISH SPECIES PER FISHING SET AND COMPARED BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT HOOK STYLE AND BAIT TYPE COMBINATIONS. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE EFFECTS OF HOOK STYLE AND BAIT ON THE CPUES WERE SPECIES-SPECIFIC. FOR EXAMPLE, SWORDFISH (TARGET SPECIES, XIPHIAS GLADIUS) CPUES WERE HIGHER WITH J-HOOKS BAITED WITH SQUID, WHILE FOR THE BLUE SHARK (MOST IMPORTANT BYCATCH SPECIES, PRIONACE GLAUCA) THE HIGHEST CPUES WERE OBTAINED WITH CIRCLE HOOKS BAITED WITH MACKEREL. FOR TUNA (THUNNUS SPP.) AND MARLIN (BLUE, MAKAIRA NIGRICANS AND WHITE, KAJIKIA ALBIDA) ONLY THE BAIT EFFECT WAS SIGNIFICANT, WITH HIGHER CATCHES WITH SQUID. FOR THE DISCARDED SPECIES, THE PROPORTIONS OF ALIVE VS DEAD SPECIMENS AT THE TIME OF FISHING GEAR RETRIEVAL WERE ALSO SPECIES-SPECIFIC. THE TOTAL RETAINED CATCH VALUE PER UNIT OF EFFORT (VPUE) DID NOT CHANGED BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT HOOK AND BAIT COMBINATIONS, BUT THESE VPUES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON MARKET FLUCTUATIONS. © 2015 JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD.",1

ANALYSES OF OBSERVER PROGRAMME DATA FROM THE FIJI LONGLINE FISHERY FROM 2011 TO 2014 WERE CONDUCTED TO CHARACTERIZE THE SHARK AND RAY CATCH COMPOSITION AND IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY EXPLAINED STANDARDIZED CATCH RATES. CATCH DATA WERE FITTED TO GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. WITH A NOMINAL CATCH RATE OF 0.610 ELASMOBRANCHS PER 1000 HOOKS, A TOTAL OF 27 SPECIES OF ELASMOBRANCHS WERE CAPTURED, 48% OF WHICH ARE CATEGORIZED AS THREATENED UNDER THE IUCN RED LIST. SHARKS AND RAYS MADE UP 2.4% AND 1.4%, RESPECTIVELY, OF TOTAL FISH CATCH. BLUE SHARKS AND PELAGIC STINGRAYS ACCOUNTED FOR 51% AND 99% OF CAUGHT SHARKS AND RAYS, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS NEAR ELIMINATION OF ‘SHARK LINES’, BRANCHLINES SET AT OR NEAR THE SEA SURFACE VIA ATTACHMENT DIRECTLY TO FLOATS, AFTER 2011. OF CAUGHT ELASMOBRANCHS, 35% WERE FINNED, 11% HAD THE ENTIRE CARCASS RETAINED, AND THE REMAINDER WAS RELEASED ALIVE OR DISCARDED DEAD. FINNING OF ELASMOBRANCHS LISTED IN CITES APPENDIX II WAS NOT OBSERVED IN 2014. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER STANDARDIZED SHARK AND RAY CATCH RATES ON NARROWER J-SHAPED HOOKS THAN ON WIDER CIRCLE HOOKS. BASED ON FINDINGS FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES ON SINGLE FACTOR EFFECTS OF HOOK WIDTH AND SHAPE, THE SMALLER MINIMUM WIDTH OF THE J-SHAPED HOOKS MAY HAVE CAUSED THE HIGHER SHARK AND RAY CATCH RATES. FOR SHARKS, THE EFFECT OF HOOK WIDTH MAY HAVE EXCEEDED THE EFFECT OF HOOK SHAPE, WHERE SMALL INCREASES IN SHARK CATCH RATES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED ON CIRCLE VS J-SHAPED HOOKS. SHARK AND RAY STANDARDIZED CATCH RATES WERE LOWEST IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE YEAR. FOCUSING EFFORT DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR COULD REDUCE ELASMOBRANCH CATCH RATES.

RESULTS WERE COMPARED FROM 65 SETS FROM SIX COMMERCIAL FISHING VESSELS TOTALLING 50 800 HOOKS IN WHICH RINGED AND NON-RINGED 16/0 CIRCLE HOOKS WITH A 10° OFFSET WERE ALTERNATED ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE LONGLINE. IN TOTAL, 464 INDIVIDUALS WERE CAUGHT IN THE 4 YEARS OF EXPERIMENT, WITH SWORDFISH (XIPHIAS GLADIUS) COMPRISING 83% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ANIMALS CAPTURED. CATCH RATES OF TARGETED SWORDFISH WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON RINGED HOOKS (CPUERINGED HOOKS = 8.465, CPUENON-RINGED HOOKS = 6.654). RESULTS INDICATE THAT RINGED CIRCLE HOOKS CAPTURED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SMALL-SIZED SWORDFISH THAN NON-RINGED CIRCLE HOOKS (27.7% VS. 19.5%, RESPECTIVELY). FOR SPECIES WITH SUFFICIENT SAMPLE SIZES, THE ODDS RATIO (OR) OF A CAPTURE WAS IN FAVOUR OF RINGED HOOKS; SIGNIFICANTLY FOR SWORDFISH (OR = 1.27 95%CI 1.04–1.57), AND NOT SIGNIFICANTLY FOR BLUEFIN TUNA (THUNNUS THYNNUS) (OR = 1.50, 95%CI 0.68–3.42) NOR FOR PELAGIC STINGRAY (PTEROPLATYTRIGON VIOLACEA) (OR = 1.13, 95%CI 0.54–2.36). ALL SIX LOGGERHEAD TURTLES (CARETTA CARETTA) AND THREE OF THE FOUR BLUE SHARKS (PRIONACE GLAUCA) WERE CAPTURED ON RINGED HOOKS, HOWEVER, THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZES PREVENTED MEANINGFUL STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. IN SUMMARY, RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT THE ADDITION OF A RING TO 16/0 CIRCLE HOOKS CONFERS HIGHER CATCHABILITY FOR SMALL-SIZED COMMERCIAL SWORDFISH, AND DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CATCH RATE OF BYCATCH SPECIES AND PROTECTED SPECIES IN A MEDITERRANEAN SHALLOW PELAGIC LONGLINE FISHERY. THESE FINDINGS SHOULD MOTIVATE FISHERIES MANAGERS TO CONSIDER FACTORS IN ADDITION TO HOOK SHAPE WHEN AIMING TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE FISHING PRACTICES.

BYCATCH REDUCTION DEVICES (BRDS) THAT INCREASE CATCH SPECIFICITY HAVE BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY IN SOME FISHERIES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH DEVICES REMAINS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE GLOBAL EFFORT TO REDUCE BYCATCH RATES.

THE DEVICES INCLUDED REDUCTIONS IN TRAP OPENING SIZES AND NOVEL BENT-TUNNEL OPENINGS. REDUCING TRAP OPENING SIZE DID NOT AFFECT BYCATCH RATES OF ROCKFISH OR OTHER NON-TARGET FISH SPECIES.

TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIALS AND CHALLENGES OF THESE PARADIGM SHIFTS, A 6-MONTHS ‘UNRESTRICTED GEAR’ TRIAL WAS PERFORMED IN DENMARK IN 2015. TWELVE TRAWLERS WERE CHALLENGED TO TEST THEIR OWN SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE UNWANTED BYCATCH AND/OR CHOKE SPECIES, WHILE MAINTAINING PROFITABLE. THE PARTICIPATING FISHERS TESTED DIFFERENT OPTIONS DEPENDING ON THEIR FISHERY AND THE TYPE OF ISSUES THEY FACED INDIVIDUALLY, AND ADJUSTED THEIR TEST FISHERY OVER TIME THROUGH INCREMENTAL SMALL STEPS. NINE VESSELS REDUCED DISCARD RATIO IN THE TEST FISHERY, ONE SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TEST AND CONTROL FISHERY, WHILE TWO VESSELS DISPLAYED AN INCREASE IN DISCARD RATIO. CATCH COMPOSITIONS ALSO DIFFERED, WITH FEWER “CHOKE SPECIES” OCCURRING IN THE TEST FISHERIES AND A MORE VALUABLE SIZE COMPOSITION. ULTIMATELY, DESPITE SMALLER LANDINGS IN MULTIPLE VESSELS, NO VESSEL SHOWED REDUCTION IN VALUE-PER-UNIT-EFFORT (VPUE) AND ONE BALTIC VESSEL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE VPUE. THIS TRIAL SHOWED THAT RELAXING TECHNICAL REGULATIONS COMBINED WITH PROPER INCENTIVES HAS A POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO COPE WITH THE LANDING OBLIGATION, WHERE UNWANTED CATCHES COULD BE REDUCED TO SOME EXTENT WITHOUT NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON ECONOMIC VIABILITY.",3

THIS STUDY TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A NOVEL OTTER-BOARD DESIGN, TERMED THE “BATWING” (COMPRISING A 0.1-M WIDE SLED WITH AN OFFSET SAIL AT 20° AOA) WOULD HAVE RELATIVELY FEWER BOTTOM IMPACTS THAN A CONVENTIONAL FLAT-RECTANGULAR OTTER BOARD (35° AOA, WITH A SIMILAR HYDRODYNAMIC SPREADING FORCE). PAIRS OF EACH OTTER BOARD WERE SUSPENDED BENEATH A PURPOSE-BUILT RIG COMPRISING A BEAM AND POSTERIOR SEMI-PELAGIC COLLECTION NET AND REPEATEDLY DEPLOYED ACROSS ESTABLISHED TRAWL GROUNDS IN AN AUSTRALIAN ESTUARY. COMPARED WITH THE CONVENTIONAL OTTER BOARDS, THE BATWINGS DISPLACED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER EMPTY SHELLS (ANADARA TRAPEZIA AND SPISULA TRIGONELLA) BY 89% AND SCHOOL PRAWNS (METAPENAEUS MACLEAYI) BY UP TO 78%. THESE RATES WERE SIMILAR TO THE DIFFERENCE IN BASE-PLATE BOTTOM CONTACT (87%). FURTHER, THE BATWING DAMAGED PROPORTIONALLY FEWER DAMAGED SHELLS, ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR DISPLACEMENT AWAY FROM THE BOARD'S SURFACE AREA. OTHER DEBRIS (LIGHTER PIECES OF WOOD) AND BENTHIC FISH (BRIDLED GOBIES, ARENIGOBIUS BIFRENATUS) WERE NOT AS GREATLY MOBILISED (I.E. REDUCED BY 50 AND 25%, RESPECTIVELY); POSSIBLY DUE TO THEIR POSITION ON OR SLIGHTLY OFF THE BOTTOM, AND A SIMILAR INFLUENCE OF HYDRODYNAMIC DISPLACEMENT BY THE HYDRO-VANE SURFACE AREAS. ALTHOUGH THE CONSEQUENCES OF REDUCING OTTER-BOARD BOTTOM CONTACT LARGELY REMAIN UNKNOWN, LOW AOA DESIGNS LIKE THE BATWING MAY REPRESENT A PRACTICAL OPTION FOR FISHERIES WHERE TRAWLING IS PERCEIVED TO BE HAZARDOUS TO SENSITIVE HABITATS.",1

WE FURTHER HYPOTHESIZED THAT, DUE TO THE NON-HERDING NATURE OF NORTHERN SHRIMP (PANDALUS BOREALIS), THE USE OF AN OFF-BOTTOM FLOATING BRIDLE WOULD NOT REDUCE SHRIMP CATCH. THESE HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED IN THE FIELD BY COMPARING A TRAWL WITH REGULAR BOTTOM-TENDERING WIRE BRIDLES AND THE SAME TRAWL WITH FLOATING SYNTHETIC BRIDLES IN THE GULF OF MAINE NORTHERN SHRIMP FISHERY. AS EXPECTED, NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN CATCH RATES AND SIZE WERE FOUND FOR THE TARGETED NORTHERN SHRIMP (146.3 ± 10.58 KG H-1 CONTROL VS. 140.8 ± 9.35 KG H-1, P = 0.13). TOTAL FINFISH BYCATCH WAS REDUCED BY 14.9%, AND THE DIFFERENCE WAS STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT (P = 0.01).

THE REDUCTIONS IN FLOUNDER BYCATCH INDICATE REDUCED HERDING OF BENTHIC SPECIES WHEN THE BRIDLES ARE KEPT OFF BOTTOM.

IN THE MIXED-SPECIES BOTTOM-TRAWL FISHERIES OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC CATCHES CAN BE INCREASED BY FITTING A LENGTH OF CHAIN KNOWN AS A “TICKLER” IN FRONT OF THE GROUNDGEAR OF THE TRAWL. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE TICKLER IS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE AT CATCHING SKATES AND RAYS THAT MAY OTHERWISE ESCAPE BENEATH THE NET. A TRIAL WAS UNDERTAKEN WITH PAIRED TOWS WITH AND WITHOUT THE TICKLER CHAIN. THE TRIAL DEMONSTRATED THAT THE CATCH RATE OF SKATES AND SHARKS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED BY REMOVING THE TICKLER. A SET OF SECONDARY NETS (GROUNDGEAR BAGS) ATTACHED BEHIND THE GROUNDGEAR OF THE MAIN NET ALLOWED THE NUMBER OF FISH ESCAPING UNDER THE NET TO BE ESTIMATED AND SHOWED THAT THE REDUCTION OF SKATES AND SHARKS IN THE MAIN NET WAS ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN NUMBER IN THE GROUNDGEAR BAGS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT PROHIBITION OF THE USE OF TICKLER CHAINS IN AREAS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO SKATES AND SHARKS COULD HAVE CONSERVATION BENEFITS. THE REMOVAL OF THE TICKLER CHAIN HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON CATCH RATES OF HADDOCK, WHITING, AND FLATFISH, BUT CAUSED A MARKED DECREASE IN THE CATCH RATE OF COMMERCIALLY VALUABLE ANGLERFISH.",1

THERE ARE FEW, IF ANY, STUDIES THAT HAVE DETERMINED MITIGATION PERFORMANCES OF BRDS FROM SUBSURFACE INTERACTIONS FOR THESE SPECIES, AS MOST ARE RARELY ENCOUNTERED AND THUS REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS OF OBSERVER COVERAGE FOR ROBUST ASSESSMENTS. THIS STUDY COMBINED IN-NET AND ONBOARD (774 DAY TRAWLS AND 1320 DAY TRAWL HOURS OF SUBSURFACE OBSERVER COVERAGE) ELECTRONIC MONITORING ON ALL FISH-TRAWL VESSELS (N = 3) TO COMPARE BYCATCH MITIGATION PERFORMANCES AMONG NINE MEGAFAUNA GROUPS, BASED ON ESCAPE RATES AND INTERACTION DURATIONS FOR THREE BRDS OVER 6 MONTHS (JUNE TO DECEMBER 2012). OVERALL, 26.9% OF DAY TRAWLS HAD NO MEGAFAUNA INTERACTIONS AND 38.3% OF THE 1826 INTERACTIONS ESCAPED, WITH MOST IN RAPID TIME (91.4% IN = 5 MIN). THE UPWARD INCLINED EXCLUSION GRID SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE ESCAPE PROPORTIONS FOR MOST CHONDRICHTHYANS BY 20–30%.

CETACEAN (BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS ONLY) INTERACTIONS WITH BRDS WERE VERY RARE (N = 7) DESPITE HIGH LEVELS OF ATTENDANCE AND DEPREDATION DURING TRAWLING. LOSS OF TARGETED TELEOSTS THROUGH THE BRD HATCH WAS RARE (1.3% OF DAY TRAWLS). THIS RELATIVELY COST-EFFECTIVE METHOD OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING ACHIEVED VERY HIGH LEVELS OF SUBSURFACE OBSERVER COVERAGE (60% OF DAY TRAWLS OR 56% OF DAY TRAWL HOURS), AND PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT THE SUBSURFACE EXPULSION OF MEGAFAUNA IN POOR CONDITION IS NEGLIGIBLE.

OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF POST-FIRE LANDSCAPE CONDITIONS ON THE OCCURRENCE OF FORAGING BATS IN MIXED FORESTS OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU PHYSIOGRAPHIC REGION. WE DEPLOYED ANABAT II BAT DETECTORS IN 164 PAIRED BURNED AND UNBURNED FOREST SITES FOR =2 NIGHTS FROM MID-MAY THROUGH AUGUST 2014 AND 2015 TO MONITOR BAT FORAGING AND COMMUTING HABITAT USE. WE CONDUCTED VEGETATION SURVEYS TO QUANTIFY SITE-SPECIFIC STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH INDICATED THAT MEASURES OF STRUCTURE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN BURNED SITES THAN UNBURNED SITES. WE USED PROGRAM PRESENCE TO TEST A PRIORI HYPOTHESES OF SPECIES-SPECIFIC PROBABILITY OF DETECTION AND SITE OCCUPANCY RELATED TO WEATHER, BURN HISTORY (I.E., SITE BURNED WITHIN THE PAST 10 YEARS OR UNBURNED), AND SITE AND LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS. BATS WERE DETECTED AT 94% OF BURNED SITES AND 83% OF UNBURNED SITES. PROBABILITY OF DETECTION WAS AFFECTED BY WEATHER CONDITIONS, VEGETATIVE STRUCTURE, AND BURN HISTORY FOR MOST SPECIES. OCCUPANCY FOR ALL SPECIES/SPECIES GROUPS EXAMINED WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH BURNING AND GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER VEGETATIVE STRUCTURE. ALTHOUGH BURN SEVERITY DID NOT AFFECT MOST SPECIES GROUPS, OCCUPANCY OF MYOTIS SPECIES AND TRI-COLORED BATS (PERIMYOTIS SUBFLAVUS) WAS LOWER IN SITES THAT RECEIVED MODERATE SEVERITY BURNS THAN IN SITES THAT RECEIVED LOW SEVERITY BURNS. THEREFORE, WHILE PRESCRIBED FIRE MAY PROVIDE VEGETATIVE STRUCTURE CONDUCIVE TO EFFICIENT FORAGING FOR ALL BATS OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU, OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT RETAINING SOME UNBURNED FORESTS WHILE CREATING MOSAICS OF LOWER AND HIGHER SEVERITY BURNS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE WILL RESULT IN FAVORABLE FORAGING CONDITIONS FOR ALL RESIDENT BAT SPECIES. © 2019 ELSEVIER B.V.",1

HABITAT FRAGMENTATION AFFECTS BATS DURING THEIR DAILY MOVEMENTS BETWEEN ROOSTS AND FORAGING AREAS. AS BATS ARE PROTECTED IN EUROPE, DEVELOPERS MUST IMPLEMENT SPECIFIC MITIGATION MEASURES THAT ARE HIERARCHICALLY STRUCTURED TO ACHIEVE A NULL NET IMPACT. HOWEVER, VERY FEW SPECIFIC MITIGATION MEASURES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN SPECIFICALLY FOR BATS. BAT OVERPASSES (E.G. GANTRIES) ARE AMONG PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS INTENDED TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF ROADS, BUT THEY HAVE RARELY BEEN TESTED. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OVERPASSES IN FACILITATING SAFE ROAD CROSSING OF BATS IS CRITICAL FOR JUSTIFYING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS MITIGATION MEASURE. WE THEREFORE ASSESSED WHETHER BAT OVERPASSES ARE EFFECTIVELY USED BY BATS. WE STUDIED THREE BAT OVERPASSES WITH DIFFERENT DESIGNS IN FRANCE. WE DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE METHOD TO CHARACTERIZE BAT CROSSINGS USING ACOUSTIC FLIGHT PATH RECONSTRUCTION (AFPR). WE USED SIX PAIRS OF STEREO ACOUSTIC RECORDERS IN DIFFERENT HABITAT TYPES THAT WERE LOCATED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD, AND OPERATED SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. RECORDING DATA CONTAINED 57,941 BAT PASSES AND 284 BAT CROSSINGS FROM SIX SPECIES OF BATS AT THE THREE STUDY SITES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CROSSINGS ARE MORE NUMEROUS IF AN OVERPASS IS LOCATED WHERE BAT COMMUTING ROUTES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT. HOWEVER, WE FOUND THAT THE PROPORTION OF BAT CROSSINGS ALONG THE COMMUTING ROUTE WAS THE SAME WITH OR WITHOUT AN OVERPASS; THUS HIGHLIGHTING THAT BAT OVERPASSES DO NOT FULLY RESTORE HABITAT CONNECTIVITY. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT ACOUSTIC FLIGHT PATH RECONSTRUCTION (AFPR) IS A USEFUL APPROACH TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON BAT FLIGHT BEHAVIOUR.

TO DETERMINE HOW FIRE AFFECTS A RARE BAT SPECIES THAT SPECIALIZES ON GLEANING MOTHS FROM FOREST VEGETATION, WE STUDIED HOME RANGES AND NOCTURNAL HABITAT SELECTION IN RAFINESQUE'S BIG-EARED BATS (CORYNORHINUS RAFINESQUII) IN AN UPLAND FOREST ECOSYSTEM WHERE SMALL-SCALE, LOW-TO-MODERATE INTENSITY PRESCRIBED BURNING OCCURS IN SPRING. WE FOUND HOME RANGES OF BIG-EARED BATS TO BE NOTABLY SMALL (X = 169 HA; N = 41), NOT DIFFERENT IN SIZE AMONG SEXES AND REPRODUCTIVE CLASSES, AND LOCATED NONRANDOMLY ON THE LANDSCAPE. HOME RANGES OF FEMALES WERE LOCATED FARTHEST FROM RIPARIAN AREAS, WHEREAS HOME RANGES OF MALES WERE FARTHEST FROM BURNED FORESTS.

IN AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP NON-LETHAL METHODS OF MITIGATING PREDATION, THE FEASIBILITY OF DEPLOYING POTENTIAL SHARK DETERRENTS AT FFS WAS EXAMINED, AND THEN TESTS WERE DONE TO SEE IF ANY OF THE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED DEVICES OR A CONTINUOUS HUMAN PRESENCE DETERS SHARK PREDATION OF MONK SEAL PUPS. DURING THE FEASIBILITY TRIAL, AN UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC PLAYBACK AND A MOORED BOAT PERFORMED WITHOUT ISSUE. A FLOAT ARRAY PROVED HAZARDOUS TO NON-TARGET WILDLIFE AND ELECTRONIC DIVER DEVICES FUNCTIONED POORLY; BOTH WERE OMITTED FROM FURTHER EXPERIMENTATION. THE NUMBER OF SHARK SIGHTINGS AND PREDATION INCIDENTS AT TWO PUPPING ISLETS WAS COMPARED ACROSS TWO EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS: (1) ACOUSTIC PLAYBACK AND A MOORED BOAT, AND (2) CONTINUOUS HUMAN PRESENCE, VERSUS A CONTROL. SHARKS WERE SIGHTED WITH A REMOTE CAMERA SYSTEM; PREDATION INCIDENTS WERE EVIDENT FROM BITE WOUNDS OR THE DISAPPEARANCE OF PUPS. OBSERVED SHARK ACTIVITY WAS RARE (12 SIGHTINGS ON VIDEO AND SIX PREDATION INCIDENTS) BUT SIMILAR TO RECENT YEARS. THE NUMBER OF SHARK SIGHTINGS AND PREDATION INCIDENTS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREATMENTS AND THE CONTROL. THE RELATIVE SCARCITY OF SHARK ACTIVITY IN THE SHALLOWS AROUND THE PUPPING ISLETS MADE DETECTING A TREATMENT EFFECT CHALLENGING. SHARKS' WARINESS TO HUMANS IS PROBABLY VARIABLE, UNPREDICTABLE, POSSIBLY INDIVIDUALISTIC AND UNRELIABLE AT FFS. THE ACOUSTIC PLAYBACK AS A DETERRENT COULD BENEFIT FROM FURTHER TESTING AND DEVELOPMENT.

THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MPA IN IMPROVING THE SURVIVAL RATE OF HECTORS DOLPHIN AT BANKS PENINSULA. 2. OVER 21 YEARS, WE UNDERTOOK PHOTO-IDENTIFICATION SURVEYS OF HECTOR'S DOLPHINS ALONG STANDARDIZED TRANSECTS FROM SMALL OUTBOARD-POWERED BOATS.

WE ESTIMATED MEAN ANNUAL SURVIVAL DURING THE PRE-SANCTUARY AND POST-SANCTUARY PERIODS BY APPLYING A BAYESIAN RANDOM EFFECTS CAPTURE-RECAPTURE MODEL TO THE DATA. POPULATION GROWTH WAS ESTIMATED FROM POPULATION SIMULATIONS USING A STAGE-STRUCTURED MATRIX MODEL. 3. WE ESTIMATE A 90\% PROBABILITY THAT SURVIVAL HAS IMPROVED BETWEEN THE PRE-SANCTUARY AND POSTSANCTUARY PERIODS, WITH ESTIMATES OF MEAN SURVIVAL PROBABILITY INCREASING BY 5 4\% (FROM 0 863 TO 0 917).

WE TESTED A NEW METHOD THAT SELECTIVELY INFLICTED STARTLE RESPONSES IN HARBOUR SEALS (PHOCA VITULINA) AT CLOSE RANGES TO THE LOUDSPEAKER BUT NOT IN A NON-TARGET SPECIES, THE HARBOUR PORPOISE (PHOCOENA PHOCOENA), BY USING A FREQUENCY RANGE WHERE PORPOISE HEARING WAS LESS SENSITIVE THAN THAT OF PHOCID SEALS.

ACOUSTIC DETERRENTS ON FISHING NETS ARE WIDELY USED TO REDUCE INCIDENTAL CAPTURES OF DOLPHINS AND PORPOISES, BUT THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE AS TO WHETHER THEY EFFECTIVELY DETER LARGE WHALES.

EXPOSURE LEVELS WERE MEASURED AS BOTH STIMULUS TYPE (I.E. ‘PEOPLE’, ‘PADDLERS’, ‘SMALL’, ‘MEDIUM’, AND ‘LARGE VESSELS’, ‘TOUR VESSELS’, AND ‘JET SKIES’), AND PEOPLE (‘DIRECT’, ‘ATTRACT’, ‘INTERACT’, ‘VIEW’, ‘INCIDENTAL’, ‘WATER’, ‘LOW-LEVEL’), AND VESSEL ACTIVITIES (‘INTERACT’, ‘APPROACH/FOLLOW’, ‘ANCHOR NOISE’, ‘ENGINE NOISE’, ‘CLOSE TO BEACH’, ‘MODERATE/FAST TRAVEL’, ‘SLOW TRAVEL’, ‘TRANSIT’, ‘DRIFT/AT ANCHOR’, ‘AIRCRAFT NOISE’). EXPOSURE LEVELS VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE ISLANDS IN NUMBERS, STIMULI TYPE, DURATION AND MINIMUM APPROACH DISTANCES. THE INSTANTANEOUS BEHAVIOURS OF ‘LIFT HEAD’, ‘INTERACT’ AND ‘SIT’ WERE THE MOST FREQUENT RESPONSES. ‘AGGRESSIVE’ AND ‘RETREAT’ RESPONSES, THE HIGHEST DISTURBANCE LEVELS MEASURED, OCCURRED ON CARNAC APPROXIMATELY ONCE PER DAY, BUT RARELY ON SEAL ISLAND. ‘AGGRESSIVE’ BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS ‘PEOPLE’ WAS OBSERVED ONLY ON CARNAC ISLAND AND ELICITED ONLY BY ‘PEOPLE’. ‘PEOPLE’, ‘TOUR VESSELS’, AND SCENIC ‘AIRCRAFTS’ ON BOTH ISLANDS AS WELL AS ‘JET SKIS’ ON CARNAC ISLAND HAD THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF TRIGGERING RESPONSES. OWING TO THEIR RELATIVELY HIGH VISITATION AT SEAL ISLAND, ‘PADDLE POWERED VESSELS’, FOLLOWED BY ‘TOUR VESSELS’ ELICITED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF RESPONSES, COMPARED WITH ‘PEOPLE’, ‘SMALL’, AND ‘MEDIUM VESSELS’ AT CARNAC ISLAND. THE MAJORITY OF RESPONSES OCCURRED WHEN ANY STIMULUS TYPE WAS AT SHORT-RANGE (=10 M), AND ‘PEOPLE’ ‘VIEWING’ N. CINEREA ELICITED MOST. VESSELS TRIGGERED MORE RESPONSES AT LARGER RANGES THAN ‘PEOPLE’. TO LIMIT CLOSE-RANGE ACCESS TO N. CINEREA, ONE POSSIBILITY IS TO CLOSE THE BEACH AT CARNAC ISLAND TO HUMAN VISITATION AND INCREASE THE MINIMUM APPROACH DISTANCE BY VESSELS AND ‘PEOPLE’ BY INSTALLING MARKER BUOYS AT LEAST 15 M FROM THE SHORE. © 2016 THE AUTHORS.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 2 DISTINCT TONES FOR USE AS AN ALARM TO ACOUSTICALLY ALERT WHALES TO FISHING GEAR PRESENCE AND THEREFORE REDUCE THE CHANCE OF ENTANGLEMENT. WE COMPARED HOW WHALES RESPONDED IN TERMS OF CHANGES OF SURFACE BEHAVIOUR AND CHANGES IN DIRECTION OF TRAVEL IN RESPONSE TO 2 ACOUSTIC TONES AND WHEN THERE WAS NO ALARM. THESE 2 ACOUSTIC TONES WERE A 5 KHZ TONE (5 S EMISSION INTERVAL AND 400 MS EMISSION DURATION, SIMILAR TO BUT HIGHER FREQUENCY THAN THE SIGNAL FROM A FUTURE OCEANS F3™ 3 KHZ WHALE PINGER®) AND A 2-2.1 KHZ SWEPT TONE (8 S EMISSION INTERVAL AND 1.5 S EMISSION DURATION). A TOTAL OF 108 TRACKS (FOCAL FOLLOWS) WERE COLLECTED USING A THEODOLITE AT CAPE SOLANDER, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, DURING THE WHALES' 2013 NORTHERN MIGRATION. LINEAR MIXED EFFECTS MODELS WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF THE DIFFERENT ACOUSTIC TONES ON WHALE DIRECTION (HEADING), AND BEHAVIOUR (DIVE DURATION AND SPEED). WHALES SHOWED NO DETECTABLE RESPONSE TO EITHER ALARM. WHALE DIRECTION AND SURFACING BEHAVIOUR DID NOT DIFFER WHETHER THE ALARM WAS 'ON' OR 'OFF'. ALTHOUGH THE RESPONSE MAY HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF THE ALARMS WERE ATTACHED TO FISHING GEAR, THE LACK OF MEASURABLE RESPONSE SUGGESTS THAT THE TYPES OF TONES USED ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ALARMS INTENDED TO REDUCE ENTANGLEMENT OF NORTHWARD MIGRATING AUSTRALIAN HUMPBACK WHALES. © THE AUTHORS 2016.",1

LEPTOSPIRURIA WAS ASSESSED BY REAL-TIME PCR OF URINE AND URINE CULTURE, WITH PERSISTENCE ASSESSED USING LONGITUDINALLY COLLECTED SAMPLES.

CESSATION OF LEPTOSPIRURIA WAS MORE LIKELY IN ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED ANTIBIOT-ICS FOR A GREATER DURATION, ESPECIALLY IF COVERAGE WAS UNINTERRUPTED. REAL-TIME PCR RESULTS INDICATE THAT AN ANTIBIOTIC PROTOCOL COMMONLY USED TO TREAT LEPTOSPIROSIS IN REHABILITATING CALIFORNIA SEA LIONS DOES NOT ELIMINATE LEPTOSPIRURIA. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ANTIBIOTIC PROTOCOLS GIVEN FOR A LONGER DURATION AND/OR INCLUDING OTHER ANTIBIOTICS MAY BE EFFEC-TIVE IN ELIMINATING LEPTOSPIRURIA.

WE TESTED THE EFFICACY OF FEAR CONDITIONING USING ACOUSTIC STIMULI FOR REDUCING CALIFORNIA SEA LION ZALOPHUS CALIFORNIANUS INTERACTIONS FROM TWO FISHING CONTEXTS IN CALIFORNIA, USA; BAIT BARGES AND RECREATIONAL FISHING VESSELS. WE PERFORMED CONDITIONING TRIALS ON 24 INDIVIDUAL SEA LIONS INTERACTING WITH BAIT BARGES. WE TESTED FOR ACQUISITION OF CONDITIONED FEAR BY PAIRING A NEUTRAL TONE WITH A STARTLE STIMULUS. AVOIDANCE WAS STRONGEST IN RESPONSE TO THE STARTLE STIMULUS ALONE, BUT LOW WHEN PAIRED WITH A NEUTRAL TONE. FROM ACTIVELY FISHING VESSELS, WE TESTED FOR FEAR CONDITIONING BY EXPOSING SEA LIONS TO A NEUTRAL TONE FOLLOWED BY A STARTLE PULSE, A STARTLE PULSE ALONE OR A NO SOUND CONTROL. WE CONDUCTED PLAYBACKS FROM 146 (INCLUDING 48 NO SOUND CONTROL) STOPS OVER TWO SUMMER FISHING SEASONS (2013, 2014).

WE TESTED THE LONG-TERM EFFECTIVENESS OF A DETERRENCE SYSTEM WHICH HARNESSES AN AUTONOMOUS REFLEX (STARTLE) TO SELECTIVELY INFLICT AVOIDANCE RESPONSES IN A TARGET SPECIES (PHOCID SEALS) BY EMITTING BAND-LIMITED NOISE PULSES WITH SHARP ONSET TIMES.

PREDATION WAS ALSO MONITORED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AT TWO CONTROL SITES AND ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT AT SITES WHICH SUFFERED HIGHER PREDATION RATES. GENERALIZED LINEAR (MIXED) MODELS REVEALED THAT SOUND EXPOSURE CAUSED A 91\% REDUCTION IN LOST FISH WHEN COMPARING PREDATION LEVELS WITHIN THE TEST SITE AND 97\% WHEN COMPARING THE TEST SITE AGAINST BOTH CONTROL SITES. SIMILARLY, SOUND EXPOSURE LED TO A 93\% REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF FISH LOST DUE TO SEAL DAMAGE AT A SHORT-TERM TEST SITE. VISUAL MONITORING OF MARINE MAMMALS AROUND THE LONG-TERM TEST SITE SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF SEAL SURFACINGS WITHIN 100 M FROM THE LOUDSPEAKERS WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY LOWER DURING SOUND EXPOSURE. HARBOUR PORPOISE AND OTTER DISTRIBUTION AROUND THE FARM WAS NOT AFFECTED BY SOUND EXPOSURE. BY ADJUSTING THE FREQUENCY COMPOSITION OF STARTLE STIMULI, OUR METHOD HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR MANAGING HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICTS IN TERRESTRIAL AND MARINE HABITATS BY SELECTIVELY DETERRING TARGET SPECIES.",1

OUR SITES WERE NOT SPATIALLY AUTO-CORRELATED, AND WERE COVERED BY NATIVE KANGAROO GRASS (THEMEDA TRIANDRA), BLACK SPEAR GRASS (HETEROPOGON CONTORTUS), OR AN INVASIVE WEED (GRADER GRASS, THEMEDA QUADRIVALVIS). REPTILE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS WERE HIGHEST WHEN SITES HAD BEEN UNBURNED FOR 2 YEARS, AND GREATLY REDUCED IN ALL AREAS POST BURNING. THE LOWEST REPTILE ABUNDANCES OCCURRED IN SITES DOMINATED BY THE WEED. REPTILE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS HAD RECOVERED IN ALL GRASS TYPES 15 MONTHS AFTER BURNING, BUT ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION CHANGED. SOME SPECIES WERE PRESENT ONLY IN BEFORE OUR FOCUS FIRE IN NATIVE GRASS, AND THEIR POPULATIONS DID NOT RECOVER EVEN 15 MONTHS POST-BURNING. EVEN IN FIREPRONE, OFTEN-BURNT HABITATS SUCH AS OUR STUDY SITES, IN WHICH FAUNAL RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WERE NOT STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY FIRE, REPTILE ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION WAS ALTERED. TO MAINTAIN FAUNAL BIODIVERSITY IN FIRE-PRONE SYSTEMS, WE SUGGEST REDUCING THE FREQUENCY OF PRESCRIBED FIRES, AND (IF POSSIBLE) EXCLUDING FIRE FROM WEEDY INVASIONS IF IT ALLOWS NATIVE GRASSES TO RETURN.

HOWEVER, THESE ACTIVITIES CHANGE LOCAL CLIMATE, AND THIS, IN TURN, ALTER THE COMPOSITION OF NATURAL COMMUNITIES. THE EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES MAY BE GREATER IN THOSE TAXONOMIC GROUPS WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY TO HABITAT DISTURBANCE, SUCH AS AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES, WHICH ARE THE UNIQUE TERRESTRIAL ECTOTHERMIC VERTEBRATES. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCES IN DIVERSITY OF AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES IN A TEMPERATE FOREST UNDER TWO SILVICULTURAL TREATMENTS, ONE OF LOW AND THE OTHER OF HIGH INTENSITY, AS WELL AS FROM ONE, FIVE AND TEN YEARS OF REGENERATION SINCE THE LAST LOGGING EVENT, SIERRA SUR OF OAXACA, MEXICO. RECORDS OF 21 SPECIES OF HERPETOFAUNA (SIX AMPHIBIANS AND 15 REPTILES) WERE OBTAINED. THE TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS WAS SIMILAR IN BOTH TREATMENTS; HOWEVER, THE COMPOSITION VARIED BETWEEN SITES WITH DIFFERENT RECOVERY TIMES. HIGHER ABUNDANCE OF AMPHIBIAN WAS PRESENTED ON SITES WITH THE LOW-INTENSITY TREATMENT, WHILE REPTILES WERE MORE ABUNDANT AT SITES WITH INTENSIVE TREATMENT. COMPARED TO A MATURE FOREST WITHOUT MANAGEMENT, SITES WITH INTENSIVE TREATMENT HAVE MORE RARE SPECIES, ALTHOUGH THE VALUES OF TRUE DIVERSITY OF AMPHIBIANS WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN TREATMENTS WITH DIFFERENT INTENSITIES, WHILE FOR REPTILES SITES UNDER TREATMENT SHOWED LESS DIVERSITY THAT UNMANAGED SITE: 33 % FOR INTENSIVE TREATMENT AND 28 % AT SITES WITH LOW INTENSITY WITH RESPECT TO ONE CONTROL SITE. COMPLEMENTARY ANALYSIS SHOWED A DIFFERENCE OF 86 % BETWEEN THE COMPOSITIONS OF SPECIES IN SITES WITH INTENSIVE TREATMENT. THE TREATMENT INTENSITY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SPECIES, BUT THE WAY THEY RESPOND TO CHANGES IN HABITAT DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH SPECIES AND ITS ABILITY TO ADAPT TO NEW CONDITIONS.",1

WE DEVELOPED A PROCESS TO ESTIMATE POPULATION SIZE USING N-MIXTURE MODELS AND SPATIAL MODELS FOR NEWLY ESTABLISHED AND DISPERSING POPULATIONS. WE USED OUR APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE POPULATION SIZE OF CRITICALLY ENDANGERED ST. CROIX GROUND LIZARDS (AMEIVA POLOPS) FIVE YEARS AFTER TRANSLOCATION OF 57 INDIVIDUALS TO BUCK ISLAND, AN OFFSHORE ISLAND OF ST. CROIX, UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS. ESTIMATES OF POPULATION SIZE INCORPORATED ABIOTIC VARIABLES, DISPERSAL LIMITS, AND OPERATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE AVAILABLE TO THE LIZARDS TO ACCOUNT FOR LOW SPECIES DETECTION. OPERATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE AND DISTANCE FROM THE TRANSLOCATION SITE WERE ALWAYS IMPORTANT IN FITTING THE N-MIXTURE MODEL INDICATING EFFECTS OF DISPERSAL AND SPECIES BIOLOGY ON ESTIMATES OF POPULATION SIZE. WE FOUND THAT THE POPULATION IS INCREASING ITS RANGE ACROSS THE ISLAND BY 5-10% EVERY SIX MONTHS. WE SPATIALLY INTERPOLATED SITE-SPECIFIC ABUNDANCE FROM THE N-MIXTURE MODEL TO THE ENTIRE ISLAND, AND WE ESTIMATED 1,473 (95% CI, 940-1,802) ST.

SCIENTISTS SHOULD THEREFORE TEST A VARIETY OF TRANSLOCATION METHODS TO REDUCE DISPERSAL WHEN MOVING WILDLIFE BETWEEN SITES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO EXAMINE HOW TRANSLOCATION METHOD (HARD- VS. SOFT-RELEASE) AND HABITAT STRUCTURE (CONTINUOUS VS. PATCHY) AFFECT MOVEMENT OF TRANSLOCATED TURTLES. A HARD-RELEASE CONSISTS OF RELEASING INDIVIDUALS TO THEIR NEW ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT ANY PRIOR ACCLIMATION, WHEREAS A SOFT-RELEASE FORCES ANIMALS TO SPEND TIME AT THE RELEASE SITE PRIOR TO RELEASE. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE TRANSLOCATION TECHNIQUE DEPENDS UPON HABITAT STRUCTURE. A SOFT-RELEASE WAS EFFECTIVE IN MINIMIZING POST-RELEASE DISPERSAL OF TRANSLOCATED TURTLES IN A CONTINUOUS LOTIC HABITAT AS THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE MOVEMENT OF SOFT-RELEASED AND RESIDENT TURTLES. HOWEVER, HARD-RELEASED TURTLES UNDERGO EXTENSIVE MOVEMENT WHEN TRANSLOCATED TO A CONTINUOUS LOTIC HABITAT AS HARD-RELEASED TURTLES HAD GREATER MOVEMENT THAN RESIDENT TURTLES. WHEN THE RELEASE SITE CONSISTS OF A PATCHY WETLAND COMPLEX, A HARD-RELEASE TRANSLOCATION MAY BE EFFECTIVE AS THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE MOVEMENT BETWEEN RESIDENT AND HARD-RELEASED TURTLES. OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT BOTH THE HABITAT STRUCTURE OF THE RELEASE SITE AND TRANSLOCATION METHOD PLAY A ROLE IN THE MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF TRANSLOCATED WILDLIFE. SEMI-AQUATIC TURTLES OR SPECIES WITH POOR VAGILITY MAY MAKE BETTER CANDIDATES FOR HARD-RELEASE TRANSLOCATIONS IN PATCHY HABITATS BECAUSE THESE SPECIES MAY BE LESS LIKELY OR UNABLE TO DISPERSE LONG DISTANCES AS RESULT OF THEIR BEHAVIOR, PHYSIOLOGY, OR THE STRUCTURE OF THE RELEASE SITE. © 2015 SOCIETY FOR ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION.",1

WE QUANTIFIED THE SUCCESS RATES FOR 1700 SEA TURTLES ADMITTED TO REHABILITATION FACILITIES IN FLORIDA (USA) BETWEEN 1986 AND 2004. REHABILITATION SUCCESS WAS LOW: 61.5\% OF TURTLES DIED IN REHABILITATION AND ONLY 36.8\% WERE RELEASED BACK INTO THE WILD. A FURTHER 1.6\% OF TURTLES WERE MAINTAINED IN CAPTIVITY PERMANENTLY DUE TO THE SEVERE NATURE OF THEIR INJURIES. MOST MORTALITY OCCURRED EARLY DURING THE REHABILITATION PROCESS (WITHIN A FEW WEEKS), AND SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION OFTEN TOOK SEVERAL MONTHS TO MORE THAN 3 YR.

PAST STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO HABITAT SUITABILITY, INCLUDING RESOURCE AVAILABILITY, PRESENCE OF INVASIVE SPECIES, LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY AND CLIMATE. HOWEVER, VISUAL CAMOUFLAGE – COLORATION THAT CONCEALS INDIVIDUALS FROM PREDATORS OR PREY – IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT ECOLOGICAL REQUIREMENT THAT HAS BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED. WE PROVIDE A CASE STUDY TO ILLUSTRATE HOW COLOR PATTERNS OF A PREY SPECIES CAN CHANGE FROM THAT OF THE SOURCE SITE FOLLOWING TRANSLOCATION. SHORE SKINKS (OLIGOSOMA SMITHI) WERE MOVED FROM A COASTAL SAND DUNE ECOSYSTEM TO AN OFFSHORE ISLAND BEACH THAT DIFFERED IN SUBSTRATE AND COLOR. WITHIN ONE YEAR FOLLOWING RELEASE, THE TRANSLOCATED POPULATION'S COLOR PATTERN VARIATION HAD REDUCED TO MOSTLY ONE PATTERN TYPE. THE HIGH MATCH IN COLOR PATTERNS BETWEEN THE SKINKS AND RELEASE SITE (INCLUDING A NEW SUBSTRATE TYPE) MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE OBSERVED COLOR PATTERN SHIFT. THIS REDUCED VARIATION IN COLOR PATTERN IMPLIES THAT NOT ALL FOUNDERS SURVIVED, POTENTIALLY DECREASING THE GENETIC DIVERSITY IN THE POPULATION.

WE TESTED IF LONG-TERM SURVIVAL RATES DIFFER BETWEEN RELEASED AND RESIDENT INDIVIDUALS, IF SURVIVAL WAS LOWER DURING THE PHASE OF ESTABLISHMENT (I.E. RELEASE COST), HOW LONG ACCLIMATION LASTS AND IF INCREASED DENSITY DUE TO RELEASES AFFECTS SURVIVAL. WE FOUND LOWER SURVIVAL OF RELEASED TORTOISES DURING THE PHASE OF ESTABLISHMENT (1 TO 3 YEARS) WHEN RESIDENTS WERE ALREADY PRESENT. AFTER ESTABLISHMENT, SURVIVAL WAS VERY HIGH AND UNAFFECTED BY DENSITY-DEPENDENCE. BODY CONDITION BEFORE RELEASE WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN RECAPTURED AND DEAD/MISSING TORTOISES, AND DID NOT PREDICT ESTABLISHMENT SURVIVAL. STOCHASTIC POPULATION VIABILITY ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT SUCCESS WHEN RELEASING SMALL NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS STRONGLY DEPENDS UPON ADULT LONG-TERM SURVIVAL. RELEASE OF SMALL SECOND BATCHES OF TORTOISES WAS NOT SENSITIVE TO A GROWING POPULATION, REGARDLESS OF ITS RELEASE TIMING. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT LONG-TERM SURVIVAL AS CRUCIAL IN TRANSLOCATION PROJECTS OF LONG-LIVED SPECIES, INVALIDATING SHORT-TERM (FIRST YEAR) SURVIVAL ASSESSMENT, WHEN SURVIVAL RELEASE COST DOES NOT MATCH LONG-TERM SURVIVAL. A RELEASE COST OF DIFFERENT DURATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN MODEL ESTIMATION BEFORE MODELING PREDICTIONS.

IN KILLBEAR PROVINCIAL PARK, FOUR ECOPASSAGES AND BARRIER FENCING WERE CONSTRUCTED ALONG THREE BUSY PARK ROADS TO REDUCE ROAD MORTALITY OF MASSASAUGAS. AIM ALTHOUGH MITIGATION OF ROAD MORTALITY HAS BEEN WIDELY RECOMMENDED AND IN SOME INSTANCES IMPLEMENTED FOR REPTILES, EFFECTIVENESS OF MITIGATION EFFORTS IS OFTEN INADEQUATELY EVALUATED. THE GOALS OF OUR STUDY WERE TO USE LONG-TERM DATA TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ECOPASSAGES AND BARRIER FENCING IN REDUCING MASSASAUGA FATALITIES ON ROADS, AND TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL OF THESE STRUCTURES TO SERVE AS MOVEMENT CORRIDORS FOR INDIVIDUAL SNAKES. METHODS WE USED FIVE APPROACHES TO ASSESS THE OVERALL EFFICACY OF MITIGATION EFFORTS: (1) COMPARISON OF PRE- AND POST-MITIGATION ROAD MORTALITY; (2) CAMERA TRAPS IN ECOPASSAGES TO DOCUMENT MASSASAUGA AND PREDATOR PRESENCE; (3) AUTOMATED TAG READERS IN ECOPASSAGE ENTRANCES TO DETECT PIT-TAGGED INDIVIDUALS; (4) AN EXPERIMENT TO ASSESS MASSASAUGA WILLINGNESS TO ENTER AND TRAVEL THROUGH ECOPASSAGES; AND (5) MEASUREMENT OF TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS IN ECOPASSAGES TO ASSESS THERMAL SUITABILITY FOR MASSASAUGAS. KEY RESULTS WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ROAD MORTALITY OF MASSASAUGAS ON STRETCHES OF PARK ROADS ASSOCIATED WITH ECOPASSAGES AND BARRIER FENCING POST CONSTRUCTION. AUTOMATED TAG READERS AND CAMERAS DETECTED THE PRESENCE OF MASSASAUGAS AND OTHER ANIMALS WITHIN THE ECOPASSAGES, AND EXPERIMENTAL DATA SHOWED THAT MASSASAUGAS WILLINGLY ENTERED, AND IN SOME CASES CROSSED THROUGH, ECOPASSAGES.

SIX OF THE SEVEN SNAKES (86%) THAT WE RELEASED THAT HAD BEEN IN CAPTIVITY FOR FOUR OR MORE YEARS BEFORE RELEASE DIED DURING THIS STUDY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY WERE ENRICHED OR NOT. ALTHOUGH W–W-TRANSLOCATED RATSNAKES MOVED MORE OFTEN AND FURTHER THAN DID SNAKES IN OTHER GROUPS, THIS DIFFERENCE WAS APPARENT ONLY IN THE FIRST MONTH POST-RELEASE. WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT ABNORMAL MOVEMENT PATTERNS OR WINTER BEHAVIOUR WAS THE CAUSE OF REDUCED SURVIVAL FOR CAPTIVE SNAKES. INSTEAD, OUR DATA SUGGESTED THAT SPENDING TIME IN CAPTIVITY REDUCED CONCEALMENT BEHAVIOUR OF SNAKES, WHICH LIKELY INCREASED THE VULNERABILITY OF SNAKES TO PREDATORS.

GRAZING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE SURVIVAL OF EUROPEAN POND TURTLE (EMYS ORBICULARIS) IN THE CAMARGUE. CONSEQUENTLY, A NEW MANAGEMENT PLAN WAS DEFINED. WE INVESTIGATED THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS MANAGEMENT USING CAPTURE-RECAPTURE METHODS TO ESTIMATE VARIATIONS OF POPULATION SIZES IN THIS MANAGED SITE AND A CONTROL SITE OVER A 17 YEARS PERIOD. RESULTS SHOW AN INCREASE OF THE NUMBER OF ADULTS AND JUVENILES ON THE MANAGED SITE AFTER THE MANAGEMENT CHANGE. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IMPROVED WATER MANAGEMENT WITH FLOODING IN AUTUMN PROVIDED BETTER HIBERNATION CONDITIONS, AND THAT REDUCED GRAZING INTENSITY IN AUTUMN/WINTER LIKELY DECREASED THE RISK OF TRAMPLING.

THE PERMANENCE OF DEGRADATION CAN ONLY BE REVERSED BY OUTCROP RESTORATION. WE CONSTRUCTED EXPERIMENTAL OUTCROPS NEAR (<150 M) AND FAR (>500 M) FROM ROADS AND WALKING TRAILS (ACCESS POINTS). WE TESTED TWO HYPOTHESES OVER A 14-YEAR PERIOD: THAT OUTCROP RESTORATION CAN RESTORE HABITAT QUALITY, AND THAT THE FREQUENCY OF OUTCROP DEGRADATION IS INFLUENCED BY DISTANCE FROM ACCESS POINTS. WE CONFIRMED THAT HABITAT VALUE WAS RESTORED: LIZARD PREY OF THE BROAD-HEADED SNAKE WAS MORE ABUNDANT IN CONSTRUCTED COMPARED TO NATURAL OUTCROPS; BROAD-HEADED SNAKES WERE DETECTED EQUALLY IN CONSTRUCTED AND NATURAL OUTCROPS.

ONE REASON IS THAT CONVENTIONAL GRAZING STUDIES OFTEN TARGET BROAD TREATMENTS RATHER THAN SPECIFIC PARAMETERS OF GRAZING (E.G., INTENSITY, DURATION, AND FREQUENCY) OR FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR HISTORICAL GRAZING EFFECTS. WE CONDUCTED A LANDSCAPE-SCALE REPLICATED GRAZING EXPERIMENT (15,000 KM(2), 97 SITES) TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF PAST GRAZING MANAGEMENT AND CURRENT GRAZING REGIMES (INTENSITY, DURATION, AND FREQUENCY) ON A COMMUNITY OF GROUND-DWELLING HERPETOFAUNA (39 SPECIES). WE ANALYZED COMMUNITY VARIABLES (SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION) FOR ALL SPECIES AND BUILT MULTISEASON PATCH-OCCUPANCY MODELS TO PREDICT LOCAL COLONIZATION AND EXTINCTION FOR THE 7 MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES. PAST GRAZING PRACTICES DID NOT INFLUENCE COMMUNITY RICHNESS BUT DID AFFECT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND PATCH COLONIZATION AND EXTINCTION FOR 4 OF 7 SPECIES. PRESENT GRAZING PARAMETERS DID NOT INFLUENCE COMMUNITY RICHNESS OR COMPOSITION, BUT 6 OF THE 7 TARGET SPECIES WERE AFFECTED BY AT LEAST ONE GRAZING PARAMETER. GRAZING FREQUENCY HAD THE MOST CONSISTENT INFLUENCE, POSITIVELY AFFECTING 3 OF 7 SPECIES (INCREASED COLONIZATION OR DECREASED EXTINCTION). PAST GRAZING PRACTICE AFFECTED COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND POPULATION DYNAMICS IN SOME SPECIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT CONSERVATION PLANNERS SHOULD EXAMINE THE DIFFERENT GRAZING HISTORIES OF AN AREA. SPECIES RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO SPECIFIC CURRENT GRAZING PRACTICES; THUS, INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT APPLY A DIVERSITY OF APPROACHES RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON A CHANGE SUCH AS REDUCED GRAZING INTENSITY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.

THE AIM WAS TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF VEGETATION TYPE, STOCKING RATE AND OTHER LANDSCAPE-SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WERE ON THE PATTERNS RECORDED. SIXTEEN 1-HA SITES WERE ESTABLISHED WITHIN THREE REPLICATED TREATMENTS (MODERATE, HEAVY AND VARIABLE STOCKING RATES). THE SITES WERE SAMPLED IN THE WET AND DRY SEASONS IN 1999–2000 (T0) AND AGAIN IN 2003–04 (T1). ALL PADDOCKS OF THE TREATMENTS WERE BURNT IN 1999. AVERAGE ANNUAL RAINFALL DECLINED MARKEDLY BETWEEN THE TWO SAMPLING PERIODS, WHICH MADE INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA DIFFICULT. A TOTAL OF 127 SPECIES OF VERTEBRATE FAUNA COMPRISING FIVE AMPHIBIAN, 83 BIRD, 27 REPTILE AND 12 MAMMAL SPECIES WERE RECORDED. THERE WAS STRONG SEPARATION IN FAUNAL COMPOSITION FROM T0 TO T1 ALTHOUGH CHANGES IN MEAN COMPOSITIONAL DISSIMILARITY BETWEEN THE GRAZING STOCKING RATE TREATMENTS WERE LESS WELL DEFINED. THERE WAS A RELATIVE CHANGE IN ABUNDANCE OF 24 BIRD, FOUR MAMMAL AND FIVE REPTILE SPECIES FROM T0 TO T1. THE GENERALISED LINEAR MODELLING IDENTIFIED THAT, IN THE T1 DATA, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN THE ABUNDANCE OF 16 SPECIES EXPLAINED BY THE GRAZING AND VEGETATION FACTORS. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT VERTEBRATE FAUNA ASSEMBLAGE DID CHANGE AND THAT THESE CHANGES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE STOCKING RATES, THE VEGETATION TYPES ON THE SITES SURVEYED, THE BURNING OF THE EXPERIMENTAL PADDOCKS AND THE DECREASE IN RAINFALL OVER THE COURSE OF THE TWO SURVEYS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE EXPERIMENT IS SAMPLED AGAIN BUT THAT THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON A RAPID SURVEY OF ABUNDANT TAXA (I.E.

USING PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES OF ANOXIA, THIS STUDY DETERMINED WHETHER PROVIDING AIR SPACES USING FLOATS WITHIN FYKE NETS COULD PREVENT TURTLES FROM DROWNING. IN A CONTROLLED SETTING, BLOOD LACTATE AND PH OF PAINTED TURTLES (CHRYSEMYS PICTA) EXPERIMENTALLY INTRODUCED INTO SUBMERGED NETS, NETS WITH FLOATS, AND NETS THAT BREACHED THE SURFACE WERE COMPARED. WHILE EMULATING COMMERCIAL FISHING PRACTICES - WHERE TURTLES AND FISH VOLUNTARILY ENTERED NETS - CATCH RATES AND COMPOSITIONS AS WELL AS BLOOD LACTATE IN TURTLES CAPTURED WERE COMPARED IN SUBMERGED NETS WITH AND WITHOUT FLOATS. PAINTED TURTLES IN SUBMERGED NETS EXHIBITED ELEVATED BLOOD LACTATE AND PRONOUNCED ACIDOSIS COMPARED WITH TURTLES FROM NETS WITH FLOATS AND SURFACED NETS. CATCH RATES AND COMPOSITIONS FROM EMULATED FISHING WERE STATISTICALLY SIMILAR IN NETS WITH AND WITHOUT FLOATS; HOWEVER, TOTAL FISH CATCHES WERE ROUGHLY ONE-THIRD LESS IN NETS WITH FLOATS. THE SAME PATTERN OF PHYSIOLOGICAL DISTURBANCE WAS OBSERVED WITH TURTLES CAPTURED IN SUBMERGED NETS WITH AND WITHOUT FLOATS AS IN THE CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT. OVERALL, BLOOD PHYSIOLOGY INDICATED THAT ANOXIA OCCURRED IN TURTLES IN SUBMERGED NETS WHILE NETS WITH FLOATS REDUCED PHYSIOLOGICAL DISTURBANCE. HOWEVER, VARIATION IN BLOOD LACTATE LEVELS WHEN FISHING FYKE NETS WITH FLOATS SUGGESTS THAT TURTLES WERE EXPERIENCING SLIGHT ANOXIA AND SO THE SIZE OF AIR SPACES MAY BE IMPORTANT IN ALLOWING ACCESS TO AIR.

TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF TERRAPINS ENTERING CRAB POTS, RESEARCHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THE USE OF BYCATCH REDUCTION DEVICES (BRDS) TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF CRAB POT OPENINGS AND THEREBY EXCLUDE TERRAPINS FROM ENTERING CRAB POTS. DESPITE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS, FEW STUDIES HAVE OBSERVED TERRAPIN INTERACTIONS WITH BRDS AND EFFECTIVELY EVALUATED THE EFFICACY OF THESE DEVICES AT PREVENTING THE ENTRY OF TERRAPINS INTO POTS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF BRD PRESENCE AND ORIENTATION ON TERRAPIN BEHAVIOUR AROUND CRAB POTS AND OVERALL TERRAPIN CAPTURE RATES. IN A CONTROLLED LABORATORY SETTING, TERRAPINS INVESTIGATED CRAB POTS MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN CRAB POTS WERE BAITED WITH FISH VERSUS CHICKEN. TERRAPINS WERE CAPTURED MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN BRDS WERE NOT INSTALLED. THE PRESENCE OF THE BRDS ALSO INCREASED THE LENGTH OF TIME NECESSARY FOR A TERRAPIN TO ENTER A CRAB POT AND DECREASED THE PROPORTION OF ENTRIES RELATIVE TO THE NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS. VERTICALLY-ORIENTED BRDS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN HORIZONTALLY-ORIENTED BRDS AT REDUCING TERRAPIN CAPTURES. TO PREVENT THE CONTINUED DECLINE OF TERRAPIN POPULATIONS DUE TO CRAB FISHERIES, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT CRABBERS AVOID THE USE OF FISH AS BAIT IN CRAB POTS TO REDUCE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF POTS TO TERRAPINS AND FIT ALL CRAB POTS WITH VERTICALLY-ORIENTED BRDS TO REDUCE TERRAPIN ENTRAPMENT.

HERE, WE USED A TARGETED APPROACH TO TEST THE RELATIONSHIP OF HABITAT FEATURES TO POST-TRANSLOCATION DISPERSAL AND SURVIVAL OF JUVENILE MOJAVE DESERT TORTOISES GOPHERUS AGASSIZII. 3. WE SELECTED THREE HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS - RODENT BURROWS, SUBSTRATE TEXTURE (PREVALENCE AND SIZE OF ROCKS) AND WASHES (EPHEMERAL RIVER BEDS) - THAT ARE TIED TO DESERT TORTOISE ECOLOGY. AT THE POINT OF RELEASE, WE DOCUMENTED RODENT BURROW ABUNDANCE, SUBSTRATE TEXTURE AND WASH PRESENCE AND ANALYSED THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE MAXIMUM DISPERSAL.

IN GENERAL, THE PRESENCE OF REFUGIA OR OTHER AREAS THAT ENABLED ANIMALS TO AVOID DETECTION, SUCH AS BURROWS AND SUBSTRATE, DECREASED THE OVERALL MORTALITY AS WELL AS PREDATOR-MEDIATED MORTALITY. THE PRESENCE OF WASHES AND SUBSTRATE THAT ENHANCED THE TORTOISES' ABILITY TO AVOID DETECTION ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDUCED DISPERSAL AWAY FROM THE RELEASE SITE.

THE PRESENT PAPER REPORTS MARINE TURTLE BYCATCH COMPOSITION AND RATES FROM A PORTUGUESE COMMERCIAL LONGLINE FISHERY TARGETING SWORDFISH IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC, AND INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN HOOK STYLE AND BAIT TYPE. IN TOTAL, 310 LONGLINE SETS WERE CARRIED OUT BETWEEN 2008 AND 2012. THREE DIFFERENT HOOK STYLES WERE TESTED, TRADITIONAL J HOOK (9/0) AND TWO 17/0 CIRCLE HOOKS (A NON-OFFSET AND A 10O OFFSET), BUT ONLY ONE BAIT TYPE WAS USED IN EACH SET (SCOMBER SPP. OR ILLEX SPP.). TWO SPECIES OF SEA TURTLES WERE CAUGHT, THE LEATHERBACK DERMOCHELYS CORIACEA, AND THE LOGGERHEAD CARETTA CARETTA, THE LATTER COMPRISING THE MAJORITY OF THE CATCHES. THE HIGHEST MEAN BYCATCH PER UNIT OF EFFORT VALUES FOR BOTH SPECIES COMBINED (1.693/1000 HOOKS) AND FOR THE INDIVIDUAL SPECIES (1.505/1000 HOOKS FOR LOGGERHEADS) OCCURRED WITH J-STYLE HOOKS BAITED WITH SQUID. CHANGING FROM J-STYLE TO ONE OF THE CIRCLE HOOKS WAS ONLY SIGNIFICANT WHEN USING SQUID BAIT (WITH THE ODDS-RATIOS DECREASING BETWEEN 54% AND 63%). HOOKING LOCATION WAS SPECIES-SPECIFIC, WITH MOST LOGGERHEADS HOOKED BY THE MOUTH, WHILE LEATHERBACKS WERE MOSTLY HOOKED EXTERNALLY BY THE FLIPPERS. OVERALL, 65% OF ALL SEA TURTLES WERE RELEASED ALIVE (85% FOR LEATHERBACKS COMPARED WITH 63% FOR LOGGERHEADS). SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF SEA TURTLE ACCIDENTAL CATCHES ON THE SWORDFISH LONGLINE FISHERIES CAN BE ACHIEVED BY CHANGING THE J HOOKS TO CIRCLE HOOKS, ESPECIALLY IF BAITED WITH MACKEREL.

HERE, WE REPORT EARLY RESULTS FROM AN EXPERIMENT DESIGNED TO MANIPULATE CWD IN YOUNG RESTORATION PLANTINGS (0-7 YEAR OLD) IN TROPICAL NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA FOR THE PURPOSES OF FACILITATING RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF RAINFOREST REPTILES. AFTER 1 YEAR, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT CWD ADDITION WITHIN RESTORATION PLANTINGS ADJACENT TO REMNANT FOREST CAN INCREASE THE LOCAL ABUNDANCE OF REPTILES AND PROMOTE COLONISATION OF THE LOG-SPECIALIST PRICKLY SKINK (GNYPETOSCINCUS QUEENSLANDIAE). THESE PRELIMINARY RESULTS, HOWEVER, ARE BASED ON OBSERVATIONS OF JUST 44 INDIVIDUAL REPTILES ENCOMPASSING SEVEN SPECIES.

TO DETERMINE SURVIVAL, MOVEMENTS, AND HABITAT USE OF THESE HEADSTARTED BLANDING'S TURTLES, WE EXTERNALLY ATTACHED RADIO-TRANSMITTERS TO 24 TURTLES AND RELEASED THEM AT 4 SITES IN RELEASE GROUPS OF 6 ALONG A TRANSECT IN A WETLAND WITHIN SNWR DURING JUNE 2014. WE LOCATED TURTLES WEEKLY DURING THE ACTIVE SEASON (MAY–SEP) AND EVERY 2 WEEKS DURING THE INACTIVE SEASON (OCT–APR) FOR 18 MONTHS, STARTING IMMEDIATELY AFTER RELEASE AND ENDING NOVEMBER 2015. WE CALCULATED STRAIGHT-LINE DISTANCES BETWEEN RELEASE SITES AND HOME RANGE CENTERS OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. WE EXAMINED HABITAT USE OF THE TURTLES IN RELATION TO HABITAT AVAILABILITY. TO PREDICT MOVEMENT OF HEADSTARTED BLANDING'S TURTLES AWAY FROM RELEASE SITES, WE USED GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION (GWR) WITH MEASURED HABITAT FACTORS AND RELEASE SITES AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. THERE WERE DIFFERENCES IN HOME RANGE SIZES ACROSS RELEASE GROUPS BUT NOT BETWEEN YEARS. HEADSTARTED JUVENILE BLANDING'S TURTLES IN THIS STUDY HAVE HOME RANGE SIZES SIMILAR TO THOSE MEASURED IN OTHER STUDIES FOR WILD-HATCHED JUVENILES BUT SMALLER HOME RANGES THAN THOSE MEASURED FOR WILD-HATCHED ADULTS. OUR STUDY SHOWED THAT HEADSTARTED BLANDING'S TURTLES USED HABITATS WITH MUSKRAT (ONDATRA ZIBETHICA) DENS AND CATTAILS (TYPHA SPP.) MORE THAN PROPORTIONALLY AVAILABLE, AND USED OPEN WATER, WILLOWS (SALIX SPP.), AND LOWLAND FOREST LESS THAN PROPORTIONALLY AVAILABLE. THE GWR MODEL WAS ABLE TO PREDICT HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS (WATER DEPTH AND TEMPERATURE, DUCKWEED [LEMNA MINOR], CATTAILS, MUSKRAT DENS AND FIELDS, BUTTONBUSH [CEPHALANTHUS OCCIDENTALIS]) THAT INFLUENCED THE MOVEMENT OF TURTLES AWAY FROM THE RELEASE SITES. THE HABITAT COEFFICIENT'S INFLUENCE ON MOVEMENT VARIED IN RELATION TO THE CURRENT LOCATION OF THE TURTLE AND AS HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS INCREASED OR DECREASED. TURTLE DISTANCE FROM RELEASE SITES DECREASED AS WATER DEPTH, WATER TEMPERATURE, AND DUCKWEED INCREASED, AND INCREASED AS CATTAILS, MUSKRAT DENS AND FIELDS, AND BUTTONBUSH INCREASED.

AVAILABLE STATISTICS ON TURTLE TRADE WERE ALSO USED AS COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. WE INTERVIEWED LOCAL RESIDENTS WHO WERE EXPOSED (N = 50) AND NOT EXPOSED (N = 50) TO TURTLE CONSERVATION INITIATIVES. WHEN EVALUATING THE TWO FOCAL TURTLE SPECIES, WE FOUND DIFFERENCES IN DIRECT USE BETWEEN PEOPLE EXPOSED AND NOT EXPOSED TO CONSERVATION PROGRAMS, WHERE PEOPLE EXPOSED TO CONSERVATION INITIATIVES MADE LESS DIRECT USE OF THESE FOCAL SPECIES. HOWEVER, WHEN OTHER SYMPATRIC TURTLE SPECIES WERE CONSIDERED, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN LEVELS OF TURTLE EXPLOITATION BETWEEN PEOPLE EXPOSED AND NOT EXPOSED TO CONSERVATION PROGRAMS. THUS, SUCCESSFULLY REDUCING THE CONSUMPTION OF A FOCAL TURTLE SPECIES MIGHT LEAD TO AN INCREASED USE OF OTHER LOCAL TURTLE SPECIES. ALMOST ALL INTERVIEWED LOCALS WERE AWARE OF TURTLE POPULATION DECLINES, WITH THE PERCEIVED MOST SERIOUS RISK TO TURTLE SPECIES REPORTED BEING HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION FOLLOWED BY HUMAN CONSUMPTION. REGARDING TURTLE TRADE, WE DID NOT FIND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. ILLEGAL TRADE LEVELS IN 2010 WERE 6.5 GREATER COMPARED TO 2016.

THIS ENDANGERED SUBSPECIES IS FOUND WITHIN THE ALBERA NATURE RESERVE, WHERE THIS STUDY WAS PERFORMED. WE SELECTED THREE FORMERLY HIGH-DENSITY TORTOISE AREAS TO CARRY OUT DIFFERENT TRIALS WHOSE AIMS WERE TO: (1) IDENTIFY NEST PREDATOR SPECIES, (2) TEST THE SUCCESS OF REDUCING THE SHRUB COVER TO REDUCE NEST PREDATION IN POTENTIAL NEW NESTING AREAS, AND (3) ASSESS FENCING EFFICIENCY TO EXCLUDE PREDATORS. FOR THE FIRST OBJECTIVE, CAMERA-TRAPPING WAS USED TO IDENTIFY NEST PREDATORS, WITH SARDINES AND ARTIFICIAL TORTOISE NESTS AS LURES. WE OBTAINED 825 PICTURES OF POSSIBLE PREDATORS AND DEMONSTRATED THAT THE BEECH MARTEN WAS THE MOST ABUNDANT PREDATOR IN THE STUDY AREAS, FOLLOWED BY THE BADGER AND THE WILD BOAR. FOR THE SECOND OBJECTIVE, PREDATION OF ARTIFICIAL NESTS WAS COMPARED BETWEEN PLOTS MANAGED FOR SHRUB REDUCTION (27 PLOTS OF 4, 25, AND 100 M2) AND A NATURAL NESTING AREA (NINE CONTROL PLOTS OF 100 M2). PREDATION WAS STRONG IN THE MANAGED PLOTS (43. 6% AFTER 48 H AND 99. 6% AFTER 144 H) BUT HIGHEST IN THE CONTROL AREA (100% AFTER 48 H). SURPRISINGLY, PREDATION OCCURRED AT AN EVEN FASTER PACE WHEN WE REPEATED THE TRIAL WITH A SINGLE ARTIFICIAL NEST (IN ORDER TO REDUCE ODOR INTENSITY). FINALLY, WE COMPARED PREDATION RATES BETWEEN EIGHT FENCED AND EIGHT UNFENCED PLOTS OF 100 M2. FENCING WAS PARTIALLY EFFECTIVE TO CONTROL NEST PREDATION BECAUSE IT EXCLUDED ALL THE MAIN PREDATOR SPECIES EXCEPT THE BEECH MARTEN, WHICH LEARNED TO GO THROUGH IT.

KNOWLEDGE OF MACRO AND MICROHABITAT USE AND HOME RANGE SIZE HAS CONSIDERABLE PRACTICAL VALUE FOR LAND MANAGERS. WITH THIS AIM WE FIRST STUDIED THE HOME RANGE AND HABITAT PREFERENCES IN WESTERN HERMANN’S TORTOISES BY RADIO TRACKING 15 ADULTS WEEKLY FROM MARCH 2008 TO MAY 2009 IN THREE LOCALITIES WITHIN THE ALBERA POPULATION RANGE (NE IBERIAN PENINSULA). WE ESTIMATED HOME RANGES WITH FIXED KERNEL ESTIMATOR (FK) AND MINIMUM CONVEX POLYGON (MCP) AFTER CHECKING TORTOISE SITE FIDELITY. WE OBSERVED THAT HOME RANGE SIZE DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES (MEAN FK = 2.01 HA, MEAN MCP = 3.01 HA). SECONDLY, WE STUDIED MACROHABITAT SELECTION USING A VEGETATION MAP. PREFERRED HABITATS WERE OPEN SHRUBLAND, OPEN FOREST AND BARREN LAND DURING THE ACTIVITY PERIOD, AND DENSE FOREST, DENSE SHRUBLAND AND OPEN SHRUBLAND DURING THE HIBERNATION. NEXT, WE ASSESSED MICROHABITAT SELECTION ALONG FIVE PERIODS OF THE ANNUAL CYCLE: HIBERNATION, EMERGENCE FROM HIBERNATION, SPRING, SUMMER AND AUTUMN. WE THEN LOCATED MARKED TORTOISES WEEKLY AND CLASSIFIED THE PLANT SPECIES OBSERVED IN EACH LOCATION. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSES SHOWED THAT TORTOISES SELECTED SHRUBS WITH TREES DURING HIBERNATION, BRAMBLE DURING SUMMER AND HERBACEOUS HABITAT DURING THE BREEDING SEASON. ALL THESE RESULTS CAN PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS THAT SET ASIDE AREAS OF HABITAT CRITICAL TO CONSERVE VIABLE POPULATIONS, ALTHOUGH IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO PREVENT MORTALITY FROM FORESTRY WORKS. WE THEREFORE TESTED A NEW BRUSH CUTTER HEAD ACCESSORY TO ACHIEVE TORTOISE-SAFE UNDERGROWTH CLEARING. TO THIS AIM WE DISTRIBUTED 52 FROZEN HYBRID TORTOISES AMONG EIGHT PLOTS OF 100 M 2 , CLEARED SIX OF THESE PLOTS WITH THE ACCESSORY AND TWO WITHOUT IT, AND EVALUATED THE SCARS OF THE BLADE ON CAPARACES.

WE COMPARED RODENT, SNAKE AND RAPTOR ACTIVITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS AT PAIRED UNRESTORED AND RESTORED GRASSLANDS ACROSS FOUR BLOCKED LOCATIONS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY USING TRAPPING AND OBSERVATIONAL SURVEYS IN UP TO FOUR SEASONS PER GUILD FROM 2014 TO 2015. RESTORED TREATMENTS WERE PLANTED WITH NATIVE PERENNIAL GRASSES 13-24 YEARS PRIOR TO STUDY INITIATION BUT WERE PARTIALLY RE-INVADED BY MEDITERRANEAN ANNUAL GRASSES AND FORBS. UNRESTORED TREATMENTS CONTAINED SIMILAR NON-NATIVE PLANT SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES AS RESTORED TREATMENTS, BUT DID NOT CONTAIN ANY NATIVE GRASS. 3. RODENT, SNAKE AND RAPTOR ACTIVITY WAS GENERALLY HIGHER IN UNRESTORED RELATIVE TO RESTORED TREATMENTS. FOR RODENTS, THE NON-NATIVE MUS MUSCULUS (HOUSE MOUSE) SHOWED THE GREATEST DISPARITY IN ABUNDANCE, WHILE GREATER RAPTORS AND SNAKES LIKELY RESPONDED TO GREATER RODENT ABUNDANCE. 4. WITHIN TREATMENTS, SPECIES-SPECIFIC RODENT RESPONSES WERE RELATED TO STRUCTURE OF PHYSICAL VEGETATION. IN PARTICULAR, PEROMYSCUS MANICULATUS (NATIVE DEER MOUSE) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE BARE GROUND AND SHORTER VEGETATION, WHILE THE HOUSE MOUSE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LESS BARE GROUND AND TALLER VEGETATION, REGARDLESS OF TREATMENT TYPE.

OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT WHILE GRASSLAND RESTORATION MAY PROMOTE PERSISTENCE OF NATIVE PLANT COMMUNITIES, RESTORATION MAY NOT BE BENEFICIAL TO SOME HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS, AND IN FACT MAY REDUCE HABITAT VALUE FOR SOME NATIVE PREDATORS IN GRASSLANDS INVADED BY MEDITERRANEAN PLANT SPECIES. CHANGES IN VEGETATION STRUCTURE CAN STRONGLY IMPACT WILDLIFE SPECIES COMPOSITION, SUGGESTING A MORE NUANCED APPROACH IS REQUIRED FOR THE RESTORATION OF DESIRED WILDLIFE COMMUNITIES.

FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE BENEFITS OF AES IN PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY RELATIVE TO THE WIDER FARMING LANDSCAPE, AND NO STUDIES HAVE EXPLICITLY QUANTIFIED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AES TO INCREASE HERPETOFAUNAL DIVERSITY. TO EXAMINE WHETHER AES PROTECT AND INCREASE HERPETOFAUNA, WE ESTABLISHED A LANDSCAPE-WIDE BIODIVERSITY MONITORING PROGRAMME IN THREATENED SEMI-ARID AND TEMPERATE WOODLAND COMMUNITIES IN SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA. WITH 31 SPECIES RECORDED, REGIONAL HERPETOFAUNAL DIVERSITY WAS RELATIVELY HIGH, WHEREAS LOCAL DIVERSITY WAS LOW. HERPETOFAUNAL RICHNESS AND REPTILE ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN SITES UNDER AES AND SITES MANAGED FOR LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION. A GRADIENT IN SPECIES RICHNESS AS A FUNCTION OF TIME-SINCE-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION WAS NOT EVIDENT, ALTHOUGH THE ABUNDANCE OF ONE LIZARD SPECIES INCREASED UNDER VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. REPTILE RICHNESS AND FROG ABUNDANCE DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG VEGETATION TYPES. HERPETOFAUNAL RICHNESS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO NATIVE PLANT RICHNESS AND BARE GROUND COVER, WHEREAS BOULENGER'S SKINK MORETHIA BOULENGERI WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY BARE GROUND COVER.

TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC HARVESTING PRESSURE ON BIG-HEADED TURTLE POPULATIONS, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF ILLEGAL HARVESTING ON THE DEMOGRAPHY OF POPULATIONS IN HONG KONG, WHERE SOME POPULATIONS STILL EXIST. WE USED MARK-RECAPTURE METHODS TO COMPARE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN SITES WITH HARVESTING HISTORIES AND ONE SITE IN A FULLY PROTECTED AREA.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF RETAINING HATCHLINGS IN HATCHERIES AFTER EMERGENCE AND DELAYING NEST EXCAVATIONS ON THE QUALITY OF GREEN TURTLE CHELONIA MYDAS HATCHLINGS. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECT OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING ON THE SEA-FINDING ABILITY OF GREEN TURTLES WAS INVESTIGATED TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF HATCHLING RELEASE LOCATIONS ON HATCHERY BEACHES. HATCHLING RUNNING SPEED, AN INDICATOR OF VIGOUR AND PREDATION EXPOSURE, PROGRESSIVELY DECREASED WHEN HATCHLINGS WERE RETAINED IN THE HATCHERY FOR 1, 3 AND 6 HOURS FOLLOWING EMERGENCE. SIMILARLY, BODY CONDITION (MASS:STRAIGHT CARAPACE LENGTH), AN INDICATOR OF DEHYDRATION AND/OR ENERGY CONSUMPTION, DECREASED AFTER BEING RETAINED FOR 3 AND 6 HOURS. IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT HATCHLINGS RETAINED FOR 6 HOURS AFTER EMERGENCE WOULD BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY DEHYDRATED AND DOUBLE THEIR EXPOSURE TO BEACH SLOPE PREDATION. RESIDUAL HATCHLINGS THAT WERE IMMEDIATELY EXCAVATED FROM EMERGED NESTS HAD SIMILAR RUNNING SPEED AND BODY CONDITION TO NATURALLY EMERGED SIBLINGS. HOWEVER, RESIDUAL HATCHLINGS REMOVED FROM NESTS 5 DAYS LATER HAD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED RUNNING SPEED AND BODY CONDITION, RESULTING IN ESTIMATES OF DOUBLE THE EXPOSURE TO PREDATION IN NEAR-SHORE AREAS.

IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POST-HATCHING MANAGEMENT OF SEA TURTLE HATCHERIES WORLDWIDE CAN BE MADE FROM THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY. TO MAXIMIZE RELEASE OF HATCHLINGS IN THE BEST CONDITION AS IS POSSIBLE, HATCHLINGS SHOULD BE RELEASED IMMEDIATELY AFTER EMERGENCE, INCLUDING EXCAVATION OF ANY RESIDUAL HATCHLINGS.

THIS STUDY COMPARES THE MOVEMENT PATTERNS, SITE FIDELITY, AND SURVIVAL PROBABILITY OF RESIDENT AND HARD-RELEASED MUSK TURTLES (STERNOTHERUS ODORATUS) IN A COMPLEX OF PATCHY DISTRIBUTED WETLANDS. OUR RESULTS ARE DIFFERENT FROM MOST TRANSLOCATION STUDIES AS THE MAJORITY OF TRANSLOCATED TURTLES HAD MOVEMENT (MINIMUM CONVEX POLYGON AREA, TOTAL DISTANCE MOVED, NUMBER OF WETLANDS USED, AND THE NUMBER OF MOVEMENT SHIFTS BETWEEN WETLANDS), RELEASE SITE FIDELITY, AND WETLAND FIDELITY PATTERNS THAT WERE SIMILAR TO RESIDENT TURTLES. IN ADDITION, THE SURVIVAL PROBABILITIES OF RESIDENT AND TRANSLOCATED TURTLES WERE BOTH HIGH. WE BELIEVE THE COMBINATION OF POOR OVERLAND MOVEMENT CAPABILITIES AND THE PATCHY DISTRIBUTION OF WETLANDS SURROUNDED BY A STRONG BOUNDARY MATRIX OF TERRESTRIAL HABITAT, POTENTIALLY INCREASED THE COSTS OF LEAVING THE WETLAND. THE HIGH COSTS OF TRAVELLING OVERLAND TO MORE DISTANT WETLANDS MAY HAVE CONSTRAINED THE TRANSLOCATED TURTLES DISPERSAL FROM THE RELEASE SITE AND INCREASED RELEASE SITE FIDELITY. OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT HARD-RELEASE TRANSLOCATIONS MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION METHOD FOR HIGHLY AQUATIC SPECIES UNLIKELY TO LEAVE THE WETLAND AND TRAVEL LONG OVERLAND DISTANCES.",1

IN THE CONTEXT OF THREATENED SPECIES MANAGEMENT IN AUSTRALIA, WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER LISTED SPECIES WITH RECOVERY PLANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE IMPROVED THEIR STATUS COMPARED TO LISTED SPECIES WITHOUT RECOVERY PLANS. SINCE 1999, OVER 600 DRAFT AND APPROVED RECOVERY PLANS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR MORE THAN 850 OF 1663 SPECIES CURRENTLY LISTED THREATENED SPECIES IN AUSTRALIA. WE APPLIED A NOVEL ECONOMETRIC MATCHING ANALYSIS TO REDUCE BIASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-RANDOM SELECTION OF SPECIES FOR LISTING AND RECOVERY PLANNING. WE FOUND THAT THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF A RECOVERY PLAN DID NOT HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON WHETHER A SPECIES' STATUS WAS IMPROVING, STABLE OR DECLINING. THE RESULT SUGGESTS THAT RECOVERY PLANS MAY NOT BE USEFUL IN THE SHORT TERM AND UNCERTAINTY PERSISTS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY MAKE A LONG TERM CONTRIBUTION TO SPECIES RECOVERY. ONE MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IS THE LACK OF BASIC ACCOUNTING OF RECOVERY PLANNING EFFORTS. THIS LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO REFUTE OR CONFIRM THE IMPACT OF RECOVERY PLANNING ON SPECIES STATUS, AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES.

THE AIM OF THIS PAPER WAS TO REFINE A SIMPLE BRD TO EXCLUDE 4 SPECIES OF FRESHWATER TURTLES FROM COMMERCIAL FYKE NETS IN A FISHERY IN EASTERN ONTARIO, CANADA, THAT TARGETS A VARIETY OF FISH SPECIES. WE TESTED THE EFFICACY OF MODIFIED EXCLUSION DEVICES (VERTICALLY ORIENTED EXCLUSION BARS AND A CONSTRICTION RECTANGLE) USING AN ADAPTIVE APPROACH INCLUDING IN SITU OBSERVATIONS, CONTROLLED BEHAVIOURAL EXPERIMENTS AND FIELD TRIALS. IN SITU OBSERVATIONS MADE BY CAMERA WERE USED TO ESTIMATE TURTLE CATCHABILITY AND TO DOCUMENT TURTLE BEHAVIOUR DURING NET INTERACTIONS, WHICH WAS USED TO INFORM BRD DESIGN AND PLACEMENT. IN CONTROLLED BEHAVIOURAL EXPERIMENTS, THE PASSAGE RATES OF TARGET FISH (I.E. SUNFISH), BYCATCH FISH (E.G. GAME FISH) AND TURTLES ACROSS A MODIFIED NET THROAT SUGGESTED THAT A 5 CM CONSTRICTION RECTANGLE SHOULD BE SUITABLE FOR REDUCING BYCATCH IN THIS FISHERY; TURTLES READILY TURNED SIDEWAYS TO PASS THROUGH LARGER OPENINGS. PAIRED FIELD TRIALS INDICATED THAT A 5 CM CONSTRICTION RECTANGLE REDUCED TURTLE BYCATCH FOR ALL SPECIES. THE CONSTRICTION RECTANGLE ALSO REDUCED CAPTURES OF NON-TARGET GAME FISH. IN CONTROLLED BEHAVIOURAL EXPERIMENTS, THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF A REDUCTION IN CATCHES OF TARGET SUNFISH; HOWEVER, IN PAIRED FIELD TRIALS, THERE WAS A 23.4\% REDUCTION IN SUNFISH CATCHES.

REPTILES RAPIDLY RESPOND TO CHANGES IN VEGETATION AND OTHER HABITAT DISTURBANCES, IN SPITE OF WHICH, THIS TAXA HAS RECEIVED VERY LITTLE ATTENTION WITH REGARD TO THEIR VULNERABILITY TO AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE RESPONSE OF A SQUAMATE REPTILE ASSEMBLAGE TO DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN OLIVE GROVES. REPTILE COMMUNITIES WERE RECORDED IN AREAS WITH THREE TYPES OF OLIVE GROVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: BARE GROUND, NATURAL COVER CROP, AND MONOSPECIFIC COVER CROP. WE FURTHER COMPARED HABITAT STRUCTURE AND VEGETATION RICHNESS IN THE STUDY AREA IN ORDER TO VERIFY IF MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE AND DIVERSITY OF SQUAMATE REPTILES SPECIES WITHIN OLIVE GROVES. THE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF REPTILES DIFFERED AMONG THE THREE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS MODULATED BY THE AGE OF THE OLIVE TREES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SQUAMATE REPTILE COMMUNITIES WERE MORE RESTRICTED IN AREAS OF INTENSE MANAGEMENT (BARE GROUND) THAN IN THOSE WITH COVER CROPS. WHEN HERBACEOUS COVERS EXISTED, NATURAL GROUND COVER HARBOURED A MORE DIVERSE COMMUNITY. OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT WHILE MONOSPECIFIC COVER CROPS IMPROVE THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF REPTILES, SPECIES RICHNESS DOES NOT INCREASE; HOWEVER, MORE HETEROGENEOUS HERBACEOUS GROUND COVER ( WHICH, FOR INSTANCE, CONTAIN MORE SPECIES AND ARE MORE SIMILAR TO NATURAL VEGETATION) WOULD BE A BETTER SOLUTION REGARDING THE PROMOTION OF DIVERSITY IN REPTILEASSEMBLAGES IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO QUANTIFY THE EXTENT TO WHICH COLONISATION OF THE COMPTON ROAD FAUNA OVERPASS BY REPTILE AND AMPHIBIAN SPECIES LIVING IN ADJACENT FORESTS OCCURRED. PITFALL SAMPLING AT SEVEN SAMPLING SITES OCCURRED BETWEEN JUNE 2005 AND FEBRUARY 2010, STARTING APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS AFTER OVERPASS CONSTRUCTION, WITH ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONAL DETECTIONS THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD. THE OVERPASS YIELDED HIGHER SPECIES DIVERSITY AND CAPTURE RATES COMPARED WITH THE FOREST AREAS. SPECIES ACCUMULATION CURVES DEMONSTRATED A STRONG AND CONSISTENT COLONISATION RATE OF THE OVERPASS THROUGHOUT THE SIX YEAR MONITORING PERIOD, WHILE PERSISTENT OCCUPATION BY SPECIES ON THE OVERPASS THROUGHOUT THE SIX YEARS SUGGESTS PERMANENT COLONISATION OF THE VEGETATED STRUCTURE AS AN EXTENSION OF THE NATURAL FOREST HABITAT.

AIMS WE TESTED TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF ‘TURTLE-FRIENDLY’ LIGHTS (LED AMBER-LIGHT PEAK INTENSITY 620 NM AND LED RED-LIGHT PEAK INTENSITY 640 NM) TO SEE WHETHER THEY ARE DISRUPTIVE TO THE SEA-FINDING ABILITY OF EASTERN-COAST AUSTRALIAN LOGGERHEAD TURTLE HATCHLINGS. METHODS USING STANDARD CIRCULAR-ARENA EXPERIMENTS, WE ASSESSED THE DIRECTIONAL PREFERENCE OF NEWLY EMERGED LOGGERHEAD TURTLE HATCHLINGS FROM THE WOONGARRA COAST OF QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA, DURING DIFFERENT MOON PHASES WITHOUT ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING AND IN THE PRESENCE OF ‘TURTLE-FRIENDLY’ LIGHTS. KEY RESULTS CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS, SEA-FINDING ABILITY OF HATCHLINGS WAS DISRUPTED BY THE AMBER LIGHTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE ABSENCE OF A MOON.

THE CONCEPT OF BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION RELIES PRIMARILY ON PROTECTED AREAS. YET, PROTECTED AREAS ARE INFLUENCED BY THE SURROUNDING ANTHROPOGENIC MATRIX AS DEGRADATION OF LANDSCAPES USED BY HUMANS ALSO HAS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON SPECIES WITHIN THE ADJACENT PROTECTED, NON-DEGRADED ECOSYSTEMS. INCREASING THE HETEROGENEITY OF THE ANTHROPOGENIC LANDSCAPE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROMOTE BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN PROTECTED AND NON-PROTECTED SITES. 2. TO FIND OPTIONS FOR RECONCILING LAND USE AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, WE EVALUATED REPTILE DIVERSITY OF TWO AREAS. BOTH AREAS CONTAINED THREE TYPES OF HABITAT: CULTIVATED AREAS, DEGRADED FOREST AND UNDEGRADED FOREST. IN ONE AREA (TSIM), A NETWORK OF HEDGES SURROUNDING FIELDS PROVIDED A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE RESOURCES FOR REPTILE SPECIES. ANOTHER AREA (ANDREMBA) LACKED SUCH LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS. 3. IN 480 SURVEY WALKS ON 48 TRANSECTS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED OVER TWO AREAS, WE RECORDED A TOTAL OF 24 REPTILE SPECIES, OF WHICH 18 OCCURRED IN BOTH AREAS. 4. PERENNIAL PLANT COVER EXPLAINED THE VARIATION IN LOCAL (PER TRANSECT) SPECIES RICHNESS BEST. SPECIES RICHNESS WAS LOW ALONG FIELD MARGINS IN THE CULTIVATED AREA THAT LACKED HEDGES AND HAD A PERENNIAL PLANT COVER BELOW 20\%. IT WAS HIGH IN UNDEGRADED AND DEGRADED FOREST AND ALONG HEDGES IN THE CULTIVATED AREA WHERE PERENNIAL PLANT COVER WAS ABOVE 40\%. 5. SIMILARITIES OF REPTILE ASSEMBLAGES WERE HIGHER BETWEEN HABITAT TYPES IN THE AREA STRUCTURALLY ENRICHED WITH HEDGES, THAN IN THE AREA LACKING SUCH ENRICHMENT. IN THE LATTER AREA, BETA DIVERSITY WAS LARGELY THE RESULT OF SPECIES LOSSES WHICH COULD RESULT FROM IMPEDED MOVEMENT BETWEEN HABITATS. 6. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. A CONTINUOUS NETWORK OF HEDGES AND ASSOCIATED TREES AND SHRUBS CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF REPTILE BIODIVERSITY IN DRY SOUTH-WESTERN MADAGASCAR. WHEN PRESENT, THESE INTERCONNECTED LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS ENHANCE HABITAT SUITABILITY OF THE AGRICULTURALLY USED MATRIX. THEY ALSO PROVIDE HABITAT FOR SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN. HIGH SIMILARITY BETWEEN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE AREA WITH HEDGES INDICATED THAT MOVEMENT BETWEEN HABITATS WAS FACILITATED. WE CONCLUDE THAT INCORPORATING HEDGES IN PASTURES CONTRIBUTES NOT JUST TO THE SUITABILITY OF THE MATRIX, BUT ALSO ENHANCES LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY AND THUS IMPROVES BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN THE HUMAN-USED LANDSCAPE.",2

THIS STUDY USED FISHERY-INDEPENDENT LONGLINE AND GILL-NET SURVEYS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF SUB-BAY-SIZED MPAS (C. 100–300 KM2) ON THE ABUNDANCE AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF TROPICAL COASTAL SHARKS. IN ADDITION, TAG–RECAPTURE DATA FROM FISHERY-DEPENDENT AND FISHERY-INDEPENDENT SOURCES WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE MOVEMENTS OF INDIVIDUALS ACROSS MPA BOUNDARIES. SPECIES COMPOSITION VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN MANAGEMENT ZONES, AND OVERALL SHARK ABUNDANCE ON LONGLINES WAS HIGHER INSIDE MPAS. LENGTH–FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS OF BLACKTIP (CARCHARHINUS TILSTONI/CARCHARHINUS LIMBATUS) AND PIGEYE (CARCHARHINUS AMBOINENSIS) SHARKS INSIDE MPAS INCLUDED A GREATER PROPORTION OF SHARKS LARGER THAN C. 800 MM COMPARED WITH THOSE IN OPEN ZONES, ALTHOUGH RESULTS VARIED BETWEEN GEAR TYPES FOR PIGEYE SHARKS. TAGGING AND RECAPTURE LOCATIONS INDICATED REPEATED AND POTENTIALLY LONG-TERM USE OF MPAS BY INDIVIDUALS OF SOME SPECIES. ALTHOUGH THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF MPAS WERE NOT EQUAL FOR ALL SPECIES, COASTAL MPAS MAY INCREASE THE SURVIVAL OF YOUNG SHARKS TO MATURITY, OR SHELTER PARTS OF BREEDING STOCKS, AND THEREFORE DO NOT NECESSARILY NEED TO BE LARGE TO PROVIDE BENEFITS.

WE TESTED WHETHER AUTUMN-SOWING OF CEREALS AT BOTH LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE SCALES AFFECTED THE BREEDING BIRD COMMUNITY IN A HETEROGENEOUS AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE OF SOUTH-CENTRAL SWEDEN. ROTATION BETWEEN SOWING TYPES WAS USED AS A SEMI-EXPERIMENT BASED ON 34 SPRING- VS. 41 AUTUMN-SOWN CEREAL PLOTS CENTRED ON INFIELD NON-CROP ISLANDS OF SIMILAR STRUCTURE, SIZE AND SURROUNDINGS.

THESE CROPS OFTEN LACK INVERTEBRATE AND SEED RESOURCES FOR FORAGING BIRDS AND CAN BE HOSTILE NESTING ENVIRONMENTS. CEREAL-BASED WHOLECROP SILAGES (CBWCS) OFFER POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR FARMLAND BIRDS BECAUSE THEY CAN BE GROWN WITH MINIMAL HERBICIDE APPLICATIONS AND CAN BE SPRING-SOWN WITH FOLLOWING WINTER STUBBLES. WE COMPARED THE BIODIVERSITY BENEFITS AND AGRONOMIC YIELDS OF WINTER-SOWN WHEAT AND SPRING-SOWN BARLEY AS ALTERNATIVES TO GRASS AND MAIZE SILAGE IN INTENSIVE DAIRY LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS. SEED-EATING BIRDS FORAGED MAINLY IN CBWCS FIELDS DURING SUMMER, AND MAINLY ON BARLEY STUBBLES DURING WINTER AND THIS REFLECTED THE HIGHER DENSITIES OF SEED-BEARING PLANTS THEREIN. MAIZE AND GRASS FIELDS LACKED SEED-BEARING VEGETATION AND WERE STRONGLY AVOIDED BY MOST SEED-EATING BIRDS. PRODUCTION COSTS OF CBWCS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF MAIZE AND LOWER THAN THOSE OF GRASS SILAGE. SELECTIVE (RATHER THAN BROAD-SPECTRUM) HERBICIDE APPLICATION ON SPRING BARLEY CROPS INCREASED FORB COVER, REDUCED YIELDS (BY 11\%) BUT CAUSED ONLY A SMALL (<4\%) INCREASE IN PRODUCTION COSTS. CBWCS GROWN WITH SELECTIVE HERBICIDE AND WITH FOLLOWING WINTER STUBBLES OFFER A PRACTICAL CONSERVATION MEASURE FOR SEED-EATING FARMLAND BIRDS IN LANDSCAPES DOMINATED BY INTENSIVELY-MANAGED GRASSLAND AND MAIZE. HOWEVER, THE RELATIVELY EARLY HARVESTING OF CBWCS COULD DESTROY A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF BREEDING ATTEMPTS OF LATE-NESTING SPECIES LIKE CORN BUNTING (EMBERIZA CALANDRA) OR YELLOW WAGTAIL (MOTOCILLA FLAVA). WHERE LATE-BREEDING SPECIES ARE LIKELY TO NEST IN CBWCS FIELDS, HARVESTING SHOULD BE DELAYED UNTIL MOST NESTING ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED (E.G. UNTIL AFTER 1ST AUGUST IN SOUTHERN BRITAIN).

PREDATOR EXCLUSION USING EITHER EXCLUSION FENCES OR NEST-CAGES RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HATCHING SUCCESS. THIS WAS THE CASE FOR DECLINING AS WELL AS INCREASING BIRD POPULATIONS INDICATING THAT NEST PREDATOR EXCLUSION IS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF INCREASING HATCHING SUCCESS OF VULNERABLE SPECIES.

HERE, WE REPORT THE SEABIRD RECOVERY AND VEGETATION DYNAMICS ON A SMALL CORALLINE ISLAND OF THE TROPICAL WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN, EIGHT YEARS AFTER NORWAY RAT (RATTUS NORVEGICUS) ERADICATION. TWO SPECIES OF SEABIRDS WERE BREEDING BEFORE RAT ERADICATION (RED-FOOTED AND MASKED BOOBIES, SULA SUB A AND SUB, DACTYLATRA) AND, IN BOTH SPECIES, THE NUMBER OF BREEDING PAIRS HAD AN APPARENT INCREASE OF 22-23\% PER YEAR AFTER RAT ERADICATION. SUCH A HIGH ANNUAL GROWTH RATE CANNOT BE ACHIEVED BY AUTO-RECRUITMENT ONLY AND OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT IMMIGRATION FROM OTHER SOURCE POPULATIONS NEVER OCCURRED IN AT LEAST ONE OF THESE SPECIES. WE SUGGEST THAT IT IS RATHER DUE TO A RAPID INCREASE IN BREEDING SUCCESS, WHICH RAPIDLY INCREASED THE OBSERVED NUMBER OF BREEDERS SINCE BIRDS REMAINED IN THE AVAILABLE-FOR-COUNTING-AS-BREEDERS GROUP FOR MUCH LONGER. TWO OTHER SPECIES, THE WHITE TERN (GYGIS ALBA) AND THE BROWN BOOBY (SULA LEUCOGASTER) WERE RECORDED BREEDING IN 2014. THE FORMER SPECIES HAS NOT BRED ON THE ISLAND SINCE 1856 AND THE LATTER HAS NEVER BRED ON THE ISLAND.

WE STUDIED BIRD COMMUNITY RECOVERY FOR 9 YEARS (2001-2009) DURING LANDSCAPE RESTORATION AND GUADIAMAR GREEN CORRIDOR ESTABLISHMENT IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE AZNALCÓLLAR MINE SPILL (SW SPAIN, 1998). ONE YEAR FOLLOWING PLANT RESTORATION (3 YEARS AFTER THE SPILL), VALUES FOR <U+0391>- AND <U+0392>-BIRD SPECIES DIVERSITY WERE HIGH, SOONER THAN REPORTED FOR SIMILAR RESTORATION PROCESSES ELSEWHERE. SPECIES RICHNESS, ECOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, AND ABUNDANCE INCREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY IN THE FOLLOWING 8 YEARS. OVERLAP BETWEEN COMMUNITIES IN SEQUENTIAL YEARS, MEASURED BY SIMILARITY INDEXES, INCREASED THROUGHOUT THE STUDY PERIOD TO ABOUT 70% DURING FINAL SURVEY YEARS, AND MOST BREEDING BIRD SPECIES PRESENT BEFORE THE ACCIDENT AGAIN INHABIT THE AREA. ONLY 5 YEARS AFTER THE MINE ACCIDENT, BIRD COMMUNITIES IN THE RESTORED SITE WERE SIMILAR IN SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE, AND DIVERSITY TO AN UNAFFECTED REFERENCE SITE; REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT BIRD COMMUNITIES WERE ALSO SIMILAR BETWEEN THE REFERENCE RIVER AND THE GUADIAMAR. DESPITE THE SEVERITY OF THE MINE ACCIDENT, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST A SWIFT RECOVERY OF THE BIRD COMMUNITY. WE ATTRIBUTE THIS SUCCESS TO THE RAPID RESTORATION OF HABITAT AVAILABILITY AND THE RESILIENCE OF THE BIRDS.

DETERMINING THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR ASSESSING PROGRESS TOWARD RESTORATION GOALS AND, MORE GENERALLY, FOR GAINING INSIGHT INTO ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING AND DYNAMICS. WE STUDIED THIS QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO MID- TO LARGE-SIZED TERRESTRIAL FAUNA IN RESTORED RIPARIAN HABITATS AT THE SACRAMENTO RIVER NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE USED CAMERA TRAPS TO DOCUMENT USE OF 16 RIPARIAN CORRIDOR SITES OF VARYING RESTORATION AGE. COMPARISONS OF SPECIES RICHNESS (DIVERSITY) AND VISITATION FREQUENCY (ACTIVITY) WERE MADE ACROSS DIFFERENT-AGED SITES. WE FOUND THAT PREDATOR DIVERSITY AND ACTIVITY LEVELS TENDED TO BE HIGHER IN RESTORED FORESTS THAN IN REMNANT FORESTS, AND THAT THEY TENDED TO BE HIGHEST IN YOUNG RESTORED FORESTS. THIS TREND PERSISTED WHEN DATA FROM VARIABLE SAMPLING PERIODS WERE POOLED, ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES OCCURRED MORE OFTEN IN WET AND COLD SAMPLING PERIODS. THE TREND DID NOT ALWAYS HOLD FOR THE ANIMAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE (CONSISTING OF BOTH PREDATOR AND NON-PREDATOR SPECIES). WE CONCLUDE THAT RESTORATION AGE AFFECTS PREDATOR DIVERSITY AND ACTIVITY LEVELS IN RESTORED AND REMNANT FLOODPLAIN FORESTS, AND THAT PREDATOR COMMUNITIES CAN ESTABLISH SOON AFTER RESTORATION. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT RESTORING NATURAL RIVER PROCESSES THAT PROMOTE HABITAT REGENERATION MAY BENEFIT MID- TO LARGE-SIZED TERRESTRIAL PREDATORS THAT APPEAR TO MOSTLY USE EARLY SUCCESSIONAL HABITAT. © 2016 SOCIETY FOR ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION.",NA

TWO VINEYARDS HAD A HERBACEOUS COVER PLANTED BETWEEN CROP ROWS TO PREVENT SOIL EROSION. IN ONE VINEYARD THESE HERBACEOUS COVER CORRIDORS WERE CHEMICALLY MANAGED TO PREVENT COMPETITION BETWEEN THE HERB COVER AND THE CROP, WHEREAS IN A SECOND THE HERBACEOUS COVER WAS SUBJECT TO MECHANICAL MANAGEMENT THROUGH SOME CLEARING, CROP COVERAGE, AND HEIGHT CHECKS. A THIRD VINEYARD WAS UNDER CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT (BARE SOIL AND SOIL TILLAGE) AND SERVED AS A CONTROL. WE COMPARED LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND METRICS, AND PASSERINE SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE, AND DIVERSITY BETWEEN THE THREE VINEYARDS.RESULTS OVERALL BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY, AS WELL AS ABUNDANCE OF INSECTIVOROUS PASSERINE BIRDS WERE HIGHEST IN THE MECHANICALLY MANAGED VINEYARD. THE CHEMICALLY MANAGED VINEYARD HAD LOWER SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE IN COMPARISON TO THE MECHANICALLY MANAGED VINEYARD. IN CONTRAST, THE CONVENTIONALLY MANAGED PLOT HAD THE LOWEST BIRD DIVERSITY, ABUNDANCE, AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF ALL THREE PLOTS. LANDSCAPE DIVERSITY WAS SIMILAR ACROSS THE THREE VINEYARDS.CONCLUSION ALTHOUGH OUR FINDINGS ARE PRELIMINARY AND MORE RESEARCH AND REPLICATIONS ARE NEEDED, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT MECHANICALLY MANAGED HERBACEOUS COVER CORRIDORS IN VINEYARDS, HAVE POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THE RESIDENT BIRD COMMUNITIES. © 2014 BRITISH TRUST FOR ORNITHOLOGY.",NA

USING DETECTION-NONDETECTION DATA COLLECTED DURING REPEATED CALL PLAYBACK SURVEYS AT GRAZED VS. UNGRAZED MARSHES AND A ""RANDOM CHANGES IN OCCUPANCY"" PARAMETERIZATION OF A MULTI-SEASON OCCUPANCY MODEL, WE EXAMINED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OCCUPANCY AND HABITAT COVARIATES, WHILE ACCOUNTING FOR IMPERFECT DETECTION. MARSH VEGETATION COVER WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AT GRAZED MARSHES THAN AT UNGRAZED MARSHES DURING THE GRAZING SEASON IN 2007 BUT NOT IN 2008. WINTER-SPRING GRAZING HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON BLACK RAIL OCCUPANCY AT IRRIGATED MARSHES. HOWEVER, AT NONIRRIGATED MARSHES FED BY NATURAL SPRINGS AND STREAMS, GRAZED SITES HAD LOWER OCCUPANCY THAN UNGRAZED SITES. BLACK RAIL OCCUPANCY WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MARSH AREA, IRRIGATION AS A WATER SOURCE, AND SUMMER VEGETATION COVER, AND NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MARSH ISOLATION. RESIDUAL DRY MATTER (RDM), A COMMONLY USED METRIC OF GRAZING INTENSITY, WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH SUMMER MARSH VEGETATION COVER AT GRAZED SITES BUT NOT SPRING COVER. DIRECT MONITORING OF MARSH VEGETATION COVER, PARTICULARLY AT NATURAL SPRING- OR STREAM-FED MARSHES, IS RECOMMENDED TO PREVENT NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO RAILS FROM OVERGRAZING.",NA
