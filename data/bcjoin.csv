THESE COUNTRIES ARE INVOLVED IN A REGIONAL SEA TURTLE BYCATCH PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. CIRCLE HOOKS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS A WAY TO MITIGATE INCIDENTAL MORTALITY OF SEA TURTLES. THUS, WE ANALYZE THE PERFORMANCE OF CIRCLE HOOKS IN RELATION TO)STYLE AND TUNA HOOKS ON THE HOOKING RATES OF TARGET AND NON-TARGET SPECIES IN THE ARTISANAL SURFACE LONGLINE FISHERIES OF THREE OF THE PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES WITH THE LARGEST SAMPLE SIZES (ECUADOR, PANAMA AND COSTA RICA). THESE FISHERIES TARGET MAHI-MAHI, CORYPHAENA HIPPURUS, OR A COMBINATION OF TUNAS, BILLFISHES AND SHARKS (TBS), AND USE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES AND GEAR CONFIGURATIONS TO CATCH THEIR TARGETS. FOR THE TBS FISHERY WE PRESENTED THE RESULTS OF COMPARISONS BETWEEN TUNA HOOKS AND 16/0 CIRCLE HOOKS FROM ECUADOR, PANAMA AND COSTA RICA, AND BETWEEN TUNA HOOKS AND 18/0 CIRCLE HOOKS IN COSTA RICA.

CONSERV.";"SINCE 2004, GOVERNMENTS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THE FISHING COMMUNITIES FROM NINE COUNTRIES, FROM MEXICO TO PERU, HAVE IMPLEMENTED JOINT EFFORTS TO REDUCE INCIDENTAL MORTALITY OF SEA TURTLES IN ARTISANAL LONGLINE FISHERIES OF THE EASTERN PACIFIC OCEAN (EPO). THESE COUNTRIES ARE INVOLVED IN A REGIONAL SEA TURTLE BYCATCH PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. CIRCLE HOOKS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS A WAY TO MITIGATE INCIDENTAL MORTALITY OF SEA TURTLES. THUS, WE ANALYZE THE PERFORMANCE OF CIRCLE HOOKS IN RELATION TO J-STYLE AND TUNA HOOKS ON THE HOOKING RATES OF TARGET AND NON-TARGET SPECIES IN THE ARTISANAL SURFACE LONGLINE FISHERIES OF THREE OF THE PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES WITH THE LARGEST SAMPLE SIZES (ECUADOR, PANAMA AND COSTA RICA). THESE FISHERIES TARGET MAHI-MAHI, CORYPHAENA HIPPURUS, OR A COMBINATION OF TUNAS, BILLFISHES AND SHARKS (TBS), AND USE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES AND GEAR CONFIGURATIONS TO CATCH THEIR TARGETS. FOR THE TBS FISHERY WE PRESENTED THE RESULTS OF COMPARISONS BETWEEN TUNA HOOKS AND 16/0 CIRCLE HOOKS FROM ECUADOR, PANAMA AND COSTA RICA, AND BETWEEN TUNA HOOKS AND 18/0 CIRCLE HOOKS IN COSTA RICA. FOR THE MAHI-MAHI FISHERY, WE ANALYZED THE PERFORMANCE OF 14/0 AND 15/0 CIRCLE HOOKS IN ECUADORIAN VESSELS AND 16/0 CIRCLE HOOKS IN COSTA RICAN VESSELS VS. THE TRADITIONAL J-STYLE HOOKS. A TOTAL OF 730,362 HOOKS WERE OBSERVED IN 3126 SETS. HOOKING RATES FOR TARGET AND NON-TARGET SPECIES WERE NOT CONSISTENT FOR ALL FISHERIES AND COUNTRIES ANALYZED.

IN THE BEST CASE SCENARIO, ROOSTS WOULD ATTRACT SEED-CARRYING BATS (FAMILY PHYLLOSTOMIDAE) INTO DEGRADED PASTURES AND FORM NUCLEATING PATCHES OF NATIVE VEGETATION. WE TESTED THIS SCENARIO BY MONITORING 48 ARTIFICIAL ROOSTS IN PASTURES AND ADJACENT FOREST FRAGMENTS IN SOUTHERN COSTA RICA OVER 2. YEARS. HALF OF THE PASTURE ROOSTS WERE EXPOSED TO DIRECT SUNLIGHT AND HALF WERE AFFIXED TO 4-M LIVING STAKES OF ERYTHRINA POEPPIGIANA (WALP.) O.F. COOK THAT PROVIDED SHADE. AFTER 2. YEARS, 94% OF ROOSTS IN FOREST AND 40% OF ROOSTS IN PASTURE HAD BEEN USED BY BATS AT LEAST ONCE - PRIMARILY FOR NOCTURNAL FEEDING. MAXIMUM DAILY TEMPERATURE INSIDE OF ROOSTS WAS THE BEST MICROCLIMATIC PREDICTOR OF BAT VISITATION. WE IDENTIFIED AT LEAST FIVE SPECIES OF BATS THAT VISITED ROOSTS, INCLUDING TWO FRUGIVORES (CAROLLIA AND GLOSSOPHAGA SPP.).

TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF THESE AES ON A NON-TARGET SPECIES, THE OCCURRENCE OF THE ENDANGERED COMMON HAMSTER (CRICETUS CRICETUS) WAS MAPPED BY COUNTING REOPENED WINTER BURROWS ON PAIRED SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS AND AGRICULTURAL FIELDS IN NORTH-WEST BAVARIA, GERMANY. CONCENTRATION EFFECTS IN SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF C CRICETUS IN ADJACENT AGRICULTURAL FIELDS WERE STUDIED BY MAPPING BURROWS UP TO A DISTANCE OF 200 M FROM SOWN WILDFLOWER AND AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. FURTHERMORE, C CRICETUS OCCURRENCE IN RELATION TO LOCAL (VEGETATION DENSITY, COVER OF GRASSES, VEGETATION HEIGHT, SIZE OF WILDFLOWER FIELDS) AND LANDSCAPE SCALE PARAMETERS (PERCENTAGE OF ARABLE LAND, GRASSLAND, FALLOW LAND, DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST FOREST, AND SETTLEMENT) OF SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS WAS ANALYSED. RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE WAS A CONCENTRATION OF C CRICETUS IN SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS, WHILE DENSITIES IN ADJACENT AGRICULTURAL FIELDS WERE CONSTANTLY LOW. HAMSTER OCCURRENCE WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO VEGETATION DENSITY AND GRASS COVER ON SOWN WILDFLOWER FIELDS AND POSITIVELY RELATED TO DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST FORESTS, PERCENTAGE OF ARABLE LAND AND FALLOW LAND AROUND WILDFLOWER FIELDS.

KNOWLEDGE ON GENETIC DIVERSITY IN CHINA'S HORSE POPULATIONS IS LIMITED, BUT WOULD HELP IMPROVE THE GENETIC MANAGEMENT AND ASSESS THE SUCCESS OF THE REINTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, ONE REINTRODUCED AND TWO CAPTIVE POPULATIONS WERE EXAMINED WITH 10 MICROSATELLITE LOCI TOGETHER WITH PEDIGREE DATA. THE RESULTS SHOWED HIGHER LEVEL OF DIVERSITY WITHIN THE CAPTIVE POPULATIONS THAN THE REINTRODUCED POPULATION, INDICATING SOME ALLELES MAY HAVE BEEN LOST DURING REINTRODUCTION. GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION WAS DETECTED AMONG POPULATIONS (FST=0.09Â±0.05, RHOST=0.05Â±0.02) AND BAYESIAN CLUSTERING SUPPORTED THE PRESENCE OF THREE SUBPOPULATIONS.

FIVE LOCALLY-EXTINCT MAMMAL SPECIES AND ONE REPTILE SPECIES WERE REINTRODUCED INTO A FENCED RESERVE WHERE CATS, FOXES AND RABBITS WERE EXCLUDED. REINTRODUCTIONS OF THE NATIONALLY THREATENED GREATER STICK-NEST RAT, BURROWING BETTONG, GREATER BILBY AND WESTERN BARRED BANDICOOT WERE ALL CONSIDERED SUCCESSFUL BASED ON SHORT AND MEDIUM-TERM SUCCESS CRITERIA. THESE CRITERIA INCLUDED CONTINUED SURVIVAL AFTER 8. YEARS, INCREASED DISTRIBUTION ACROSS THE LARGE RESERVE AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, RECOVERY AFTER A DROUGHT EVENT. THE TRIAL REINTRODUCTIONS OF THE NUMBAT AND WOMA PYTHON INTO THE RESERVE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL DUE TO PREDATION BY NATIVE AVIAN AND REPTILIAN PREDATORS RESPECTIVELY. OUTSIDE THE RESERVE, WHERE CATS AND FOXES WERE PRESENT BUT CONTROLLED THROUGH POISON BAITING, REINTRODUCTION ATTEMPTS OF THE GREATER BILBY AND BURROWING BETTONG WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. HIGH MORTALITY WAS ATTRIBUTED TO CAT AND FOX PREDATION WITH DINGOES ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO POST-RELEASE MORTALITY IN BETTONGS. HOWEVER, A REINTRODUCTION OF BURROWING BETTONGS INTO A FENCED AREA WITH LOW RABBIT AND CAT ABUNDANCE HAS, TO-DATE, MET SHORT-TERM AND MEDIUM-TERM SUCCESS CRITERIA.

FIVE LOCALLY-EXTINCT MAMMAL SPECIES AND ONE REPTILE SPECIES WERE REINTRODUCED INTO A FENCED RESERVE WHERE CATS, FOXES AND RABBITS WERE EXCLUDED. REINTRODUCTIONS OF THE NATIONALLY THREATENED GREATER STICK-NEST RAT, BURROWING BETTONG, GREATER BILBY AND WESTERN BARRED BANDICOOT WERE ALL CONSIDERED SUCCESSFUL BASED ON SHORT AND MEDIUM-TERM SUCCESS CRITERIA. THESE CRITERIA INCLUDED CONTINUED SURVIVAL AFTER 8. YEARS, INCREASED DISTRIBUTION ACROSS THE LARGE RESERVE AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, RECOVERY AFTER A DROUGHT EVENT. THE TRIAL REINTRODUCTIONS OF THE NUMBAT AND WOMA PYTHON INTO THE RESERVE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL DUE TO PREDATION BY NATIVE AVIAN AND REPTILIAN PREDATORS RESPECTIVELY. OUTSIDE THE RESERVE, WHERE CATS AND FOXES WERE PRESENT BUT CONTROLLED THROUGH POISON BAITING, REINTRODUCTION ATTEMPTS OF THE GREATER BILBY AND BURROWING BETTONG WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. HIGH MORTALITY WAS ATTRIBUTED TO CAT AND FOX PREDATION WITH DINGOES ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO POST-RELEASE MORTALITY IN BETTONGS. HOWEVER, A REINTRODUCTION OF BURROWING BETTONGS INTO A FENCED AREA WITH LOW RABBIT AND CAT ABUNDANCE HAS, TO-DATE, MET SHORT-TERM AND MEDIUM-TERM SUCCESS CRITERIA.

WE TESTED THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT RELEASE CONDITIONS ON SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION OF CAPTIVE BRED COMMON HAMSTERS (CRICETUS CRICETUS L. 1758), A HIGHLY ENDANGERED SPECIES IN WESTERN EUROPE. AS PREDATION PLAYS A DETERMINANT ROLE FOR RELEASED HAMSTERS, ESPECIALLY DURING THE FIRST DAYS AFTER RESTOCKING, WE PERFORMED TWO RELEASE EXPERIMENTS INTENDING TO REDUCE MORTALITY: WE TESTED (1) THE EFFICIENCY OF TERRESTRIAL PREDATOR PROOF ELECTRIC FENCES AND (2) THE IMPACT OF IMPROVED SHELTER AVAILABILITY. WE ASSESSED BOTH SURVIVAL RATE AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS BY RADIOTRACKING 70. HAMSTERS BETWEEN RELEASE DATE AND THE END OF THEIR ABOVEGROUND ACTIVE PERIOD. REDUCING CONTACT BETWEEN RELEASED ANIMALS AND PREDATORS THANKS TO ELECTRIC FENCES HAD A STRONG POSITIVE IMPACT ON HAMSTERS' SURVIVAL AND ALLOWED THEM TO HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO REPRODUCE. IT ALSO APPEARED THAT RELEASE OF HAMSTERS WAS MORE EFFICIENT IN WHEAT CROP THAN IN ALFALFA. AS EXPECTED, WHEAT HARVEST, INDUCING A SUDDEN LACK OF SHELTER, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED RESTOCKING SUCCESS.

AMONG SOME REMNANT POPULATIONS, COTTONTAILS OCCUPY SMALL PATCHES OF THICKET HABITAT WHERE THEY EXPERIENCE HIGH MORTALITY RATES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF LIMITED FOOD DURING WINTER. THIS LIMITATION CAUSES RABBITS TO FORAGE AWAY FROM COVER WHERE THEY ARE EXPOSED TO PREDATORS. ALTHOUGH CONSERVATION EFFORTS ARE EMERGING TO REVERSE THE DECLINE OF NEW ENGLAND COTTONTAILS, MOST ARE DIRECTED TOWARD IMPROVING LONG-TERM VIABILITY BY INCREASING THE ABUNDANCE OF SUITABLE HABITATS. SUCH EFFORTS DO LITTLE TO IMPROVE THE SHORT-TERM SURVIVAL OF REMAINING COTTONTAILS. TO ADDRESS THIS IMMEDIATE NEED, WE EVALUATED THE USE OF SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD AS AN APPROACH TO IMPROVE OVER-WINTER SURVIVAL RATES. WE SPECULATED THAT BY POSITIONING FEEDERS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ESCAPE COVER, RABBITS WOULD BE LESS VULNERABLE TO PREDATORS. WE EVALUATED THIS APPROACH USING EASTERN COTTONTAILS (SYLVILAGUS FLORIDANUS) AS A RESEARCH SURROGATE BECAUSE THIS SPECIES IS READILY AVAILABLE AND HAS SIMILAR HABITAT REQUIREMENTS TO NEW ENGLAND COTTONTAILS. TRANSMITTER-EQUIPPED EASTERN COTTONTAILS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER A FED OR UNFED GROUP. REMOTELY-TRIGGERED CAMERAS WERE ALSO USED TO GAUGE USE OF FEEDERS BY COTTONTAILS AND VISITS BY OTHER SPECIES. WINTER SURVIVAL RATES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FOR FED RABBITS (70\%) THAN FOR UNFED RABBITS (32\%). CAMERAS REVEALED THAT RABBITS WERE THE MOST FREQUENT CONSUMER AND THAT THERE WAS ONLY LIMITED CARNIVORE ACTIVITY NEAR FEEDERS.

AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE RESULTING LOSS OF HABITAT HETEROGENEITY, NUMEROUS SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH TRADITIONAL FARMLAND HAVE UNDERGONE SEVERE POPULATION DECLINES. TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE ON FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY, AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES (AES) HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SINCE THE EARLY 1990S. THE EFFECTS OF AES HAVE BEEN EVALUATED FOR DIFFERENT TAXA, BUT RARELY FOR LARGER MAMMALS LIKE THE BROWN HARE (LEPUS EUROPAEUS), A CHARACTERISTIC SPECIES OF TRADITIONAL OPEN FARMLAND. USING SPOTLIGHT COUNTS FROM 58 BROWN HARE MONITORING STUDY SITES OVER 17 YEARS, WE ANALYSED THE EFFECTS OF LAND-USE AND SEVERAL AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME OPTIONS ON BROWN HARE DENSITY IN THE SWISS LOWLAND.

WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR IMPERFECT DETECTION, A POPULATION RECOVERY WAS APPARENT IN BOTH LAND-USE TYPES, ALTHOUGH HARE DENSITIES REMAINED AT LOW LEVELS COMPARED TO OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE AMOUNT OF EXTENSIVELY MANAGED HAY MEADOWS SEEMED TO HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON BROWN HARE ABUNDANCE BOTH IN ARABLE AND GRASSLAND SITES. HEDGEROWS WERE ALSO POSITIVELY RELATED TO HARE DENSITY, ALTHOUGH ONLY IN ARABLE STUDY SITES. THE AMOUNT OF SET-ASIDES/WILDFLOWER STRIPS AND BROWN HARE DENSITY WERE RELATED NEITHER IN ARABLE NOR IN GRASSLAND SITES. THIS RESULT WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE FAIRLY LOW PERCENTAGES OF THIS AES OPTION IN OUR STUDY SITES. HABITAT IMPROVEMENTS BY MEANS OF AES INDICATE SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS ON BROWN HARE POPULATIONS IN SWITZERLAND, BUT THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF AES MUST STILL BE INCREASED.

AS IN THE PRACTICE OF ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT USED IN ECOLOGY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE OUTCOMES OF VARIOUS MANAGEMENT ACTIONS. IDEALLY THIS EVALUATION WILL BE DONE USING A PRIORI HYPOTHESIS TESTING, BUT RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSES CAN PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHTS AS TO WHICH METHODS WORK BETTER THAN OTHERS. THE GIANT PANDA (AILUROPODA MELANOLEUCA) CONSERVATION BREEDING PROGRAM HAS A LONG HISTORY OF ACTIVE MANAGEMENT AND THEREFORE IS RICH IN POTENTIAL LESSONS LEARNED FOR PANDA AND OTHER ENDANGERED SPECIES BREEDING PROGRAMS. NOW SELF-SUSTAINING AND EXPERIENCING EXPONENTIAL GROWTH, THE PANDA POPULATION ALSO PROVIDES SAMPLE SIZES LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT RIGOROUS STATISTICAL EVALUATION. A FUNDAMENTAL DECISION FOR ANY BREEDING PROGRAM IS WHETHER TO INVEST IN DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF ASSISTED REPRODUCTION TECHNIQUES OR TO PROMOTE NATURAL MATING. HERE WE ANALYZE 21 YEARS (1996â€“2016) OF GIANT PANDA REPRODUCTIVE DATA FROM 304 INSEMINATION EVENTS TO DETERMINE RELATIVE SUCCESS RATES OF INSEMINATION METHODS AND EVALUATE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. THE BIRTH RATE AFTER NATURAL MATING WAS 60.7%, 50.6% FOR COMBINED NATURAL MATING AND ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION TECHNIQUES, AND 18.5% FOR ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION (AI). WITHIN THE COMBINED INSEMINATION TECHNIQUE GROUP, 81.8% OF BIRTHS COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE NATURAL MATING EVENT WITH ONLY 18.2% ATTRIBUTED TO AI. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WHILE TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVING AI SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE EXPLORED AND WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR SOME CONSERVATION APPLICATIONS, BEHAVIORAL AND BIOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT TO ENCOURAGE NATURAL MATING SHOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL FOR CONSERVATION BREEDING OF THIS SPECIES.

RESERVES ARE GAZETTED IN ESTUARIES TO OFFSET IMPACTS FROM BURGEONING HUMAN POPULATIONS, HOWEVER, COASTAL CONSERVATION CANNOT BE OPTIMIZED BECAUSE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IS RARELY EVALUATED. WE SURVEYED 220 SITES IN 22 ESTUARIES IN THE MORETON BAY MARINE PARK, QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA, INCLUDING ALL SIX CURRENT ESTUARINE MARINE RESERVES WITHIN THE PARK. FISHES WERE SURVEYED USING ONE HOUR DEPLOYMENTS OF BAITED REMOTE UNDERWATER VIDEO STATIONS TWICE AT EACH SITE OVER CONSECUTIVE DAYS. WE SHOW THAT ALTHOUGH THE ESTUARINE RESERVES IN MORETON BAY CONTAIN A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FISH COMMUNITY, THEY FAIL TO ENHANCE THE ABUNDANCE OF HARVESTED FISH SPECIES. WE POSIT THAT PERFORMANCE IS LIMITED BECAUSE RESERVES PROTECT UNIQUE SPATIAL FEATURES, OR CONSERVE NARROW ESTUARIES WITH WEAK CONNECTIONS TO MANGROVE HABITATS AND THE OPEN SEA. CONSEQUENTLY, RESERVES AS CURRENTLY POSITIONED PROTECT ONLY A SUBSET OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS PRESENT FOR FISH WITHIN THE REGION, AND POTENTIALLY SUPPORT RESIDUAL ESTUARINE HABITATS (I.E. EXPANSIVE INTERTIDAL FLATS OR SHALLOW CREEKS) WHICH ARE NOT PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT TO EITHER FISH OR FISHERS. WE ARGUE THAT RESERVE EFFECTIVENESS CAN BE IMPROVED BY CONSERVING DEEPER ESTUARIES, WITH DIVERSE HABITATS FOR FISH AND STRONG CONNECTIONS TO THE OPEN SEA.

IN SHARK BAY, AUSTRALIA, A SMALL SUBSET OF THE RESIDENT POPULATION OF BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS IS REGULARLY PROVISIONED WITH FISH HANDOUTS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE WEST AUSTRALIAN DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION (DEC). PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CALVES BORN TO PROVISIONED FEMALES EXPERIENCED REDUCED CARE AND HIGHER MORTALITY RELATIVE TO CALVES OF NON-PROVISIONED MOTHERS. THESE RESULTS LED TO CHANGES IN THE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN 1994, WHICH WE ASSESSED THE EFFICACY OF BY COMPARING (1) CALF MORTALITY BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION AND (2) BEHAVIOR OF PROVISIONED WITH NON-PROVISIONED DOLPHINS IN THE POPULATION.

THESE INTERACTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE THE DEPREDATION OF CAPTURED FISH, CAN HAVE DELETERIOUS IMPACTS ON BOTH DOLPHINS AND FISHERMEN. ACOUSTIC DETERRENT DEVICES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS ONE MEANS OF REDUCING THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF THESE INTERACTIONS. WE STUDIED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS AND A GILLNET FISHERY FOR SPANISH MACKEREL (SCOMBEROMORUS MACULATUS) IN NORTH CAROLINA, USA AND INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF SAVEWAVEÂ® ACOUSTIC DETERRENT DEVICES ON TARGET FISH CATCH AND THE FREQUENCY AND NATURE OF INTERACTIONS WITH BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS. WE MADE OBSERVATIONS FROM COMMERCIAL VESSELS AND CONDUCTED FOCAL VISUAL AND ACOUSTIC FOLLOWS OF DOLPHINS FROM A RESEARCH VESSEL. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF SAVEWAVEÂ® DEVICES ON FISH CATCHES AND DOLPHIN BEHAVIOR BY COMPARING SETS WITH FUNCTIONING (ACTIVE) DEVICES AND NON-FUNCTIONING (CONTROL) DEVICES. IN 2003, WE COLLECTED BASELINE DATA ON CATCH AND DOLPHIN BEHAVIOR FROM 136 GILLNET SETS; DURING 2004 AND 2005 WE MONITORED 151 GILLNET SETS (83 WITH ACTIVE DEVICES, 68 WITH CONTROL DEVICES). FISH CATCHES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER WHEN DOLPHINS WERE OBSERVED INTERACTING WITH GILLNETS.

THESE INTERACTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE THE DEPREDATION OF CAPTURED FISH, CAN HAVE DELETERIOUS IMPACTS ON BOTH DOLPHINS AND FISHERMEN. ACOUSTIC DETERRENT DEVICES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS ONE MEANS OF REDUCING THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF THESE INTERACTIONS. WE STUDIED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS AND A GILLNET FISHERY FOR SPANISH MACKEREL (SCOMBEROMORUS MACULATUS) IN NORTH CAROLINA, USA AND INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF SAVEWAVE® ACOUSTIC DETERRENT DEVICES ON TARGET FISH CATCH AND THE FREQUENCY AND NATURE OF INTERACTIONS WITH BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS. WE MADE OBSERVATIONS FROM COMMERCIAL VESSELS AND CONDUCTED FOCAL VISUAL AND ACOUSTIC FOLLOWS OF DOLPHINS FROM A RESEARCH VESSEL. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF SAVEWAVE® DEVICES ON FISH CATCHES AND DOLPHIN BEHAVIOR BY COMPARING SETS WITH FUNCTIONING (ACTIVE) DEVICES AND NON-FUNCTIONING (CONTROL) DEVICES. IN 2003, WE COLLECTED BASELINE DATA ON CATCH AND DOLPHIN BEHAVIOR FROM 136 GILLNET SETS; DURING 2004 AND 2005 WE MONITORED 151 GILLNET SETS (83 WITH ACTIVE DEVICES, 68 WITH CONTROL DEVICES).

CONSERV.";"WITHIN A MOSAIC OF AGRICULTURAL AND URBANIZED LANDSCAPES, SHRUB HABITATS ARE IMPORTANT REFUGES THAT HELP MAINTAIN BIODIVERSITY. UNFORTUNATELY, THESE HABITATS HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY ALTERED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES FOR PRACTICAL AND ESTHETIC REASONS. CONTINUED RAPID GROWTH OF SUBURBAN AREAS HAS ACCELERATED THIS SHIFT IN HABITAT QUALITY. MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT PROMOTE SHRUB HABITAT WITHIN DEVELOPED AREAS ARE RARELY GREETED WITH PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE BECAUSE BUSHY THICKETS (E.G. RUBUS BRAMBLES) SHELTER UNDESIRED SPECIES OF ANIMALS (E.G. SNAKES, SMALL MAMMALS) AND ARE TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A LACK OF PROPERTY MAINTENANCE. WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT IN A HEAVILY IMPACTED SUBURBAN HABITAT (POPULATION DENSITY OF ~2700HUMANS/KM2). OUR STUDY SITE, CONTAINING FOREST AND MEADOW HABITATS, WAS ADJACENT TO A LARGE CITY (~320,000 INHABITANTS) AND VISITED BY >70,000 PEOPLE ANNUALLY. WE MANIPULATED THE FOREST HABITAT BY REMOVING TREES, AND THROUGH ACTIVE MAINTENANCE, THEREBY PROMOTING THE GROWTH OF BRAMBLES. WITHIN SIX YEARS, WE OBSERVED THAT NEWLY-CREATED SHRUB HABITAT WAS RAPIDLY COLONIZED BY SNAKES, NOTABLY VIPERA ASPIS. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DETECTED INDIVIDUALS INCREASED MARKEDLY OVER TIME. NUMEROUS ADVERTISING AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES ABOUT SNAKE ECOLOGY WERE CONDUCTED IN PARALLEL, ESPECIALLY WITH SCHOOL CHILDREN. COMPLAINTS FROM THE PUBLIC WERE ABSENT WHICH DEMONSTRATES THAT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT FAVOR UNPOPULAR ORGANISMS ARE FEASIBLE, EVEN IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS. © 2015 ELSEVIER LTD.";"BICOB";"X.

MALE GENETIC INTEGRATION FOR MITIGATIVE TRANSLOCATIONS HAVE AS OF YET NOT BEEN ASSESSED AND COULD GREATLY UNDERMINE THE VALIDITY OF TRANSLOCATION EVALUATIONS. TO TEST FOR SUCCESSFUL MALE INTEGRATION, WE DETERMINED GENETIC PATERNITY OF 92 DESERT TORTOISE HATCHLINGS (GOPHERUS AGASSIZII), FROM BOTH RESIDENT AND TRANSLOCATED FEMALES, FOUR YEARS AFTER THE INITIAL TRANSLOCATION EVENT AND FOUND THAT ALL 35 HATCHLINGS WITH A PATERNAL MATCH IN OUR GENOTYPE DATABASE WERE SIRED BY RESIDENTS. GIVEN THAT TRANSLOCATED MALES CONSTITUTE 46% OF THE GENOTYPED MALES FOUND IN THE HOME RANGES OF THE FEMALES, THEY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER OFFSPRING THAN RESIDENT MALES IN THE SAME AREA (G-TEST, P VALUE < 0.0001). THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY ASSESSING PATERNAL GENETIC INTEGRATION FOLLOWING A TRANSLOCATION OF A WILD SOURCED POPULATION INTO A NATIVE RESIDENT POPULATION. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT MALE CONDITION FOLLOWING THE TRANSLOCATION, FEMALE MATE PREFERENCE FOR PRIOR RESIDENTS AND COMPETITIVE EXCLUSION BY RESIDENT MALES MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOWER REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT OF TRANSLOCATED MALES.

IN THE CONTEXT OF THREATENED SPECIES MANAGEMENT IN AUSTRALIA, WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER LISTED SPECIES WITH RECOVERY PLANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE IMPROVED THEIR STATUS COMPARED TO LISTED SPECIES WITHOUT RECOVERY PLANS. SINCE 1999, OVER 600 DRAFT AND APPROVED RECOVERY PLANS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR MORE THAN 850 OF 1663 SPECIES CURRENTLY LISTED THREATENED SPECIES IN AUSTRALIA. WE APPLIED A NOVEL ECONOMETRIC MATCHING ANALYSIS TO REDUCE BIASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-RANDOM SELECTION OF SPECIES FOR LISTING AND RECOVERY PLANNING. WE FOUND THAT THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF A RECOVERY PLAN DID NOT HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON WHETHER A SPECIES' STATUS WAS IMPROVING, STABLE OR DECLINING. THE RESULT SUGGESTS THAT RECOVERY PLANS MAY NOT BE USEFUL IN THE SHORT TERM AND UNCERTAINTY PERSISTS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY MAKE A LONG TERM CONTRIBUTION TO SPECIES RECOVERY. ONE MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IS THE LACK OF BASIC ACCOUNTING OF RECOVERY PLANNING EFFORTS. THIS LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO REFUTE OR CONFIRM THE IMPACT OF RECOVERY PLANNING ON SPECIES STATUS, AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES.

MANAGERS ARE, THEREFORE, FACED WITH DECISIONS OF WHETHER TO INTERVENE TO REDUCE THIS IMPACT AND IF SO WHAT INTERVENTIONS TO USE. NEST PREDATOR EXCLUSION IS ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY USED METHODS FOR REDUCING PREDATION, PARTICULARLY FOR GROUND-NESTING SPECIES, BUT STUDIES TESTING ITS EFFECTIVENESS HAVE SHOWN MIXED RESULTS. WE USED EXPLICIT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW METHODOLOGY TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF NEST PREDATOR EXCLUSION ON HATCHING SUCCESS. WE USED META-ANALYSIS TO SUMMARISE RESULTS FROM 16 PREDATOR EXCLUSION STUDIES. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED WHETHER FACTORS RELATING TO CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PREY, PREDATOR SPECIES, LOCATION AND STUDY METHODOLOGY EXPLAINED HETEROGENEITY IN EFFECT SIZES. PREDATOR EXCLUSION USING EITHER EXCLUSION FENCES OR NEST-CAGES RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HATCHING SUCCESS. THIS WAS THE CASE FOR DECLINING AS WELL AS INCREASING BIRD POPULATIONS INDICATING THAT NEST PREDATOR EXCLUSION IS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF INCREASING HATCHING SUCCESS OF VULNERABLE SPECIES. NEST-CAGES HAD A LARGER EFFECT ON HATCHING SUCCESS THAN EXCLUSION FENCES, ALTHOUGH THIS DIFFERENCE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT AND ADDITIONAL NEST-CAGE STUDIES ARE REQUIRED AS SAMPLE SIZES WERE SMALL. HETEROGENEITY IN EFFECT SIZES WAS NOT EXPLAINED BY ANY OF THE COVARIATES INVESTIGATED. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT NEST-CAGES CAN LEAD TO INCREASED LEVELS OF PREDATION ON INCUBATING ADULTS AND SO SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION ESPECIALLY WITHIN SMALL POPULATIONS.
