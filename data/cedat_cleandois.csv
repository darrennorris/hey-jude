WE EVALUATED THE INFLUENCE OF THESE CONSERVATION GRASSLANDS ON AMPHIBIAN OCCUPANCY OF SEASONAL WETLANDS IN THE PRAIRIE POTHOLE REGION. USING AUTOMATED CALL SURVEYS, AQUATIC FUNNEL TRAPS, AND VISUAL ENCOUNTER SURVEYS, WE DETECTED EIGHT AMPHIBIAN SPECIES USING WETLANDS WITHIN THREE LAND-USE CATEGORIES (FARMED, CONSERVATION GRASSLANDS, AND NATIVE PRAIRIE GRASSLANDS) DURING THE SUMMERS OF 2005 AND 2006. SEASONAL WETLANDS WITHIN FARMLANDS WERE USED LESS FREQUENTLY BY AMPHIBIANS THAN THOSE WITHIN CONSERVATION AND NATIVE PRAIRIE GRASSLANDS, AND WETLANDS WITHIN CONSERVATION GRASSLANDS WERE USED LESS FREQUENTLY THAN THOSE WITHIN NATIVE PRAIRIE GRASSLANDS BY ALL SPECIES AND LIFE-STAGES WE SUCCESSFULLY MODELED. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, WHILE NOT OCCUPIED AS FREQUENTLY AS WETLANDS WITHIN NATIVE PRAIRIE, WETLANDS WITHIN CONSERVATION GRASSLANDS PROVIDE IMPORTANT HABITAT FOR MAINTAINING AMPHIBIAN BIODIVERSITY IN THE PRAIRIE POTHOLE REGION. © THE AUTHOR(S) 2012.",2

WE MONITORED MOVEMENTS OF 36 CAPTIVE-REARED OZARK HELLBENDERS (CRYPTOBRANCHUS ALLEGANIENSIS BISHOPI) RELEASED TO AUGMENT WILD POPULATIONS AT TWO SITES ON THE NORTH FORK OF THE WHITE RIVER (MISSOURI, USA). WE USED RADIOTELEMETRY TO COLLECT 3610 HELLBENDER LOCATIONS FROM MAY 2008 TO AUGUST 2009. WE QUANTIFIED MOVEMENTS AT MULTIPLE SPATIO-TEMPORAL SCALES AND MADE COMPARISONS BETWEEN TWO SEASONS OF MONITORING (1 = RELEASE-DECEMBER 2008; 2 = JANUARY 2009-AUGUST 2009). AT THE FINEST (DAILY) SCALE, MOST HELLBENDERS (90%-94% PER SEASON) WERE HIGHLY SEDENTARY (≥50 OF OBSERVATIONS INDICATED NO MOVEMENT). TYPICAL DISTANCES BETWEEN DAILY LOCATIONS WHEN HELLBENDERS MOVED WERE <5 M IN SEASON 1 (MEDIAN = 3.08 M, N = 331; RANGE 0.19-903.00) AND <2 M IN SEASON 2 (MEDIAN = 1.80 M; N = 161; RANGE = 0.21-34.00). DURING THE STUDY HELLBENDERS RARELY (35 OF 492 MOVEMENTS) TRAVELLED >20 M BETWEEN DAILY LOCATIONS, AND VIRTUALLY ALL (34 OF 35) SUCH MOVEMENTS OCCURRED IN SEASON 1. AT A BROADER SCALE, HOME RANGES OF HELLBENDERS VARIED WIDELY IN SEASON 1 (RANGE = 0.66-986.92 M2, N = 26), BUT IN SEASON 2 AVERAGED ONLY 31.33 M2 (± 11.81 SE, N = 8) AND 11.08 M2 (± 3.25 SE, N = 7) AT RESPECTIVE SITES. AMONG HELLBENDERS MONITORED LONG ENOUGH TO EXHIBIT SETTLEMENT (ESTIMATION OF A HOME RANGE) 69% (18 OF 26) DISPERSED ≤50 M FROM THE POINT OF RELEASE. WE ONLY NOTED MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH DISPERSALS >50 M AT ONE SITE, WHEN IT COINCIDED WITH ABANDONMENT OF CORE HABITAT THAT WAS ONE-THIRD AS LARGE AS AT THE OTHER SITE. AT THE BROADEST SCALE, 68% AND 86% OF HELLBENDERS SETTLED IN CORE HABITAT OF RESPECTIVE RELEASE SITES, AND MOST HAD SETTLED WITHIN 21 D POSTRELEASE (RANGE = 0-49 D). COLLECTIVELY, HELLBENDER MOVEMENTS INDICATED A SHORT PERIOD OF EXPLORATION FOLLOWED BY MORE PERMANENT SETTLEMENT AND HIGH SITE FIDELITY TYPICAL OF WILD CONSPECIFICS. CAPTIVE-REARED JUVENILE HELLBENDERS MAY BE WELL SUITED FOR TRANSLOCATION; HOWEVER, THE QUALITY OF HABITAT AT FINE SCALE (10-30 M2) AND THE EXTENT OF SUITABLE HABITAT WITHIN RELEASE SITES ARE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS. © 2012 BY THE HERPETOLOGISTS' LEAGUE, INC.",1

VOLUNTEERS CAN HELP TO COLLECT INFORMATION OVER LARGE SCALES, BUT THEIR DATA MAY BE AFFECTED BY HETEROGENEITY FOR SAMPLING EFFORTS AND PROTOCOLS, WHICH MAY INFLUENCE DETECTION PROBABILITY. IGNORING THIS ISSUE MAY CONDUCT TO MISLEADING CONCLUSIONS. HERE WE SHOW THAT DATA COLLECTED BY DIFFERENT VOLUNTEER GROUPS CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH MEASURES OF SAMPLING EFFORTS, TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON LARGE SCALE DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS. WE COLLECTED DATA ON 33 COMMON TOAD (BUFO BUFO) POPULATIONS ACROSS ITALY FOR THE PERIOD 1993-2010. WE USED TWO APPROACHES (META-ANALYSIS; ANALYSIS OF AVERAGE CHANGE IN POPULATION SIZE) TO EVALUATE THE OVERALL DEMOGRAPHIC TREND. WE INCORPORATED MEASURES OF VOLUNTEER SAMPLING EFFORTS INTO ANALYSES, TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CHANGES IN DETECTION PROBABILITY. TOAD ABUNDANCE SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED IN THE LAST DECADE. FROM 2000 TO 2010, 70\% OF POPULATIONS SHOWED A STRONG DECLINE, AND ONLY 10\% INCREASED. TRENDS WERE HETEROGENEOUS AMONG POPULATIONS, BUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SAMPLING EFFORT REDUCED HETEROGENEITY BY 40\%. WE DETECTED A 76\% CUMULATIVE AVERAGE DECLINE OF TOAD POPULATIONS, DESPITE AN INCREASING MEAN SAMPLING EFFORT. THE WIDESPREAD TOAD DECLINE RISES CONCERN FOR ITS FUTURE, ALSO BECAUSE THE CAUSES REMAIN UNCLEAR. VOLUNTEER DATA CAN BE EXTREMELY USEFUL TO IDENTIFY LARGE SCALE POPULATION TRENDS, IF INFORMATION ON SAMPLING EFFORT ARE RECORDED AND USED TO ADJUST COUNTS. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER LTD.

CINEREUS. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT J.LIVIDUM CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCED INTO SOIL AND CAN BE ENVIRONMENTALLY TRANSMITTED TO P. CINEREUS SKIN. WE FOUND THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSMISSION OF J.LIVIDUM INHIBITED COLONIZATION BY BD ON THE SKIN OF P.CINEREUS FIVE DAYS POST-BD EXPOSURE. SOILBIOAUGMENTATION MAY BE A FEASIBLE CONSERVATION STRATEGY THAT COULD PROTECT AMPHIBIANS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS FROM DECLINES DRIVEN BY THE DISEASE. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER LTD.

IN MAY 2008, PARKS CANADA INSTALLED FOUR AMPHIBIAN TUNNELS UNDER THIS ROAD. WE INSTALLED DRIFT FENCES TO DIRECT SALAMANDERS TOWARD TUNNEL ENTRANCES AND MONITORED TUNNEL USE WITH PITFALL TRAPS IN 2008 AND 2009. WE USED LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS AND AKAIKE'S INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC) TO DETERMINE IF PROBABILITY OF TUNNEL USE DIFFERED AMONG INDIVIDUAL SALAMANDERS. SALAMANDER ROAD MORTALITY DECREASED FROM 10 OF THE POPULATION TO <2 FOLLOWING INSTALLATION OF TUNNELS AND FENCES. IN 2009, 104 SALAMANDERS WERE DOCUMENTED USING TUNNELS. SALAMANDERS WERE 20 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO USE TUNNELS WHEN TRAVELING TO THE BREEDING SITE THAN WHEN LEAVING THE SITE. DISTANCE FROM TUNNEL ENTRANCES, SEX, AND BODY SIZE DID NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON TUNNEL USE BY SALAMANDERS. ALTHOUGH SALAMANDER MOVEMENT WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH OCCURRENCE OF PRECIPITATION, THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS MUCH STRONGER WHEN SALAMANDERS WERE LEAVING THE BREEDING SITE. VARIATION IN USE BETWEEN THE FOUR TUNNELS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH SOIL MOISTURE OF SURROUNDING HABITAT.

ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE COMPARED HERPETOFAUNAL RESPONSES IN BURNED FORESTS TO UNBURNED FORESTS, FEWER STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED CHANGES IN THE HERPETOFAUNAL COMMUNITY DURING THE INTERVAL BETWEEN SHORT-ROTATION PRESCRIBED BURNS. WE EXAMINED CHANGES IN HABITAT AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS EACH YEAR WITHIN A 3-YEAR BURN CYCLE IN NINE RESTORED PINE WOODLANDS OF WESTERN ARKANSAS, USA. OVERALL NUMBERS OF REPTILES DID NOT CHANGE AMONG THE THREE BURN YEARS; HOWEVER, CAPTURE RATES FOR ONE SNAKE SPECIES (SOUTHERN BLACK RACER [. COLUBER CONSTRICTOR PRIAPUS]) AND THREE LIZARDS DIFFERED AMONG THE THREE POST-BURN YEARS. OVERALL CAPTURE RATE FOR ANURANS AND ALL AMPHIBIANS COMBINED WAS GREATEST THE FIRST YEAR AFTER BURNING, MOSTLY BECAUSE CAPTURES OF DWARF AMERICAN TOADS (BUFO AMERICANUS CHARLESSMITHI) WERE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER IN STANDS THE FIRST YEAR AFTER BURNING. SALAMANDER CAPTURES WERE INFREQUENT. CAPTURE RATES OF MOST REPTILE AND AMPHIBIAN SPECIES DECLINED OVER THE 3-YEAR SAMPLING PERIOD. ONLY MINOR CHANGES IN CAPTURE RATE OCCURRED AMONG THE 36 SPECIES WE EVALUATED DURING THE INTERVENING YEARS BETWEEN FREQUENT BURNS. CAPTURE RATES FOR ONLY TWO SPECIES WERE LOWER THE FIRST YEAR AFTER FIRE.

TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM VEGETATIVE REGROWTH POST-HARVESTING ON AMPHIBIAN HABITAT USE, WE STUDIED THE RESPONSE OF EIGHT SPECIES (FOUR FOREST SPECIALISTS AND FOUR HABITAT GENERALISTS) TO FOUR FORESTRY TREATMENTS (PARTIAL HARVEST, CLEARCUT WITH COARSE WOODY DEBRIS [CWD] REMOVED, CLEARCUT WITH CWD RETAINED, AND UNCUT CONTROL) OVER A 6-YEAR PERIOD, USING REPLICATED EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS IN MAINE, USA. FOREST AMPHIBIANS SHOWED A STRONG NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO CLEARCUTTING THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE STUDY, REGARDLESS OF THE PRESENCE OF CWD, BUT ONLY DURING THE POST-BREEDING SEASON (I.E., SUMMER). THE SPRING BREEDING MIGRATIONS OF WOOD FROGS AND SPOTTED SALAMANDERS TO EXPERIMENTAL POOLS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE FORESTRY TREATMENTS. THE USE OF PARTIAL CUT TREATMENTS BY FOREST AMPHIBIANS DIFFERED BETWEEN ANIMALS EMERGING FROM EXPERIMENTAL POOLS (I.E., JUVENILE WOOD FROGS AND SPOTTED SALAMANDERS), AND ANIMALS ORIGINATING FROM OUTSIDE THE EXPERIMENTAL ARRAYS (I.E., ADULTS OF ALL FOREST SPECIES, JUVENILE WOOD FROGS AND SPOTTED SALAMANDERS). ANIMALS EMERGING FROM OUR EXPERIMENTAL POOLS SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE IN THE USE OF CONTROL AND PARTIAL CUT TREATMENTS, WHILE ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS PREFERRED CONTROL PLOTS. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND A MODEST INCREASE IN THE USE OF CLEARCUTS OVER THE 6. YEARS FOLLOWING HARVESTING BY JUVENILE WOOD FROGS FROM EXPERIMENTAL POOLS (FROM AN 8-FOLD DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOREST AND CLEARCUT TREATMENTS IN THE FIRST YEAR POST-CLEARCUTTING TO A 3-FOLD DIFFERENCE DURING YEARS 3-5). HOWEVER, THIS INCREASE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH VEGETATION REGROWTH. FOREST SPECIALISTS DECLINED IN ABUNDANCE IN ALL TREATMENTS BEGINNING 2-3. YEARS POST-DISTURBANCE. DESPITE HIGH YEARLY FLUCTUATIONS IN ABUNDANCE, THERE WAS A SHIFT IN RELATIVE ABUNDANCE TOWARDS HABITAT GENERALIST SPECIES, MOST NOTABLY GREEN FROG JUVENILES. MOST HABITAT GENERALIST SPECIES WERE NOT AFFECTED BY CLEARCUTTING OR VEGETATIVE REGROWTH; HOWEVER, WE OBSERVED A LOWER USE OF CLEARCUT TREATMENTS BY GREEN FROGS STARTING 3. YEARS POST-HARVESTING, PERHAPS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN HABITAT RESISTANCE TO MOVEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH VEGETATIVE REGROWTH. THESE GENERAL PATTERNS OF HABITAT USE WERE OVERRIDDEN AT THE LOCAL SCALE BY SITE-SPECIFIC VARIATION IN THE USE OF FORESTRY TREATMENTS, MOST EVIDENT IN EMIGRATING JUVENILE WOOD FROGS. FROM A MANAGEMENT STANDPOINT, IMPLEMENTING BROAD SILVICULTURAL PRESCRIPTIONS COULD BE A VIABLE STRATEGY IN EXTENSIVELY FORESTED LANDSCAPES, BUT LOCAL VARIATION IN HABITAT USE HAS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED WHEN MANAGERS FOCUS ON A LIMITED AREA. © 2012 ELSEVIER B.V.",2

TO EVALUATE THE AMPHIBIAN COLONIZATION DYNAMICS OF ARTIFICIAL MTPS IN THE NORTH-EASTERN IBERIAN PENINSULA, WE MONITORED TWO ARTIFICIAL MTPS (ONE IN A HIGH-DIVERSITY AREA AND THE OTHER IN A LOW-DIVERSITY AREA) OVER 2 YEARS. WE SELECTED REFERENCE WETLANDS AT EACH AREA, AND AMPHIBIAN COMMUNITIES OF MAN-MADE MTPS WERE COMPARED TO THOSE OF REFERENCE WETLANDS. WE FOUND THAT, BEGINNING IN THE FIRST YEAR, ARTIFICIAL MTPS WERE A VALUABLE HABITAT FOR REGIONAL AMPHIBIAN FAUNA.

THESE SPECIES ARE ADAPTED FOR FLIGHT AND FORAGING IN CLUTTERED AIRSPACE, IN TERMS OF WING MORPHOLOGY AND ECHOLOCATION SIGNAL DESIGN. EDGE-SPACE SPECIES (PIPISTRELLUS PIPISTRELLUS, PIPISTRELLUS PYGMAEUS) WERE HIGHLY ACTIVE IN THE AREA BUT NEVER FLEW THROUGH THE NARROW PIPES. ALL SPECIES, EXCEPT THE OPEN-ADAPTED NYCTALUS LEISLERI, FLEW THROUGH THE LARGE UNDERPASS. SIMULTANEOUS RECORDINGS MADE ABOVE AND BELOW THIS UNDERPASS (16 NIGHTS) ALSO INDICATED THAT SPECIES' TENDENCY TO CROSS OVER, RATHER THAN UNDER, THE STRUCTURE WAS INVERSELY RELATED TO THE DEGREE OF CLUTTER-ADAPTATION. IF MOTORWAYS ARE BUILT THROUGH BAT HABITAT, TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN OPTIMAL MITIGATION OF IMPACTS ON PROTECTED BATS AND COST/ENGINEERING PRACTICALITY ARE INEVITABLE. LARGE UNDERPASSES ARE ADVISABLE WHERE POSSIBLE AS THEY ACCOMMODATE A WIDER RANGE OF SPECIES, AND BATS ARE LESS LIKELY TO FLY OVER THEM. HOWEVER, THEIR CONSTRUCTION IS COSTLY AND IS DEPENDENT ON LANDSCAPE TOPOLOGY. IF THE TARGET SPECIES FOR MITIGATION ARE CLUTTER-ADAPTED BATS, OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT INCORPORATION OF A GREATER NUMBER OF SUITABLY LOCATED SMALL TUNNELS INTO NEW ROADS MAY FACILITATE SAFE PASSAGE MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN FEWER LARGE UNDERPASSES. © 2012 THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.",1

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF FIRE PERIODICITY ON MANY OF THE WILDLIFE SPECIES OCCUPYING THESE FORESTS. OUR GOAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE DEGREE TO WHICH A FOREST'S STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS AND INSECT ABUNDANCE AND BIOMASS INFLUENCE THE ACTIVITY OF DIFFERENT ECOMORPHOLOGICAL GUILDS OF INSECTIVOROUS BATS AND WHETHER EITHER OF THESE FACTORS WAS INFLUENCED BY THE PERIODICITY OF PRESCRIBED FIRE. WE CONDUCTED A 2-YEAR ECHOLOCATION-MONITORING STUDY OF BATS IN SANDHILLS FORESTS EXPERIENCING 3 CATEGORIES OF FIRE PERIODICITY: 1 - 2 YEARS, 3 - 5 YEARS, AND >8 YEARS. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN TREE, SHRUB, AND GROUND-LAYER CHARACTERISTICS AMONG THESE BURN-FREQUENCY CATEGORIES, BUT FEW DIFFERENCES IN ABUNDANCE OR BIOMASS OF MOST ORDERS OF NOCTURNAL INSECTS. HOWEVER, THE BIOMASS OF LEPIDOPTERA WAS GREATEST AT SITES WITH THE LONGEST TIME BETWEEN BURNS AND WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH FIRE-DEPENDENT DECIDUOUS TREE AND SHRUB DENSITIES. BAT ACTIVITY BELOW THE CANOPY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE SITES WITH >8-YEAR BURN FREQUENCIES THAN IN EITHER OF THE OTHER TREATMENTS AND WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH HEIGHT OF CANOPY CLOSURE (A FIRE-DEPENDENT VARIABLE). SPECIES-SPECIFIC ACTIVITY PATTERNS CONFIRMED ECOMORPHOLOGICAL PREDICTIONS. SMALL-BODIED SPECIES WITH LOW WING LOADINGS AND ASPECT RATIOS REPLACED LARGER, LESS-MANEUVERABLE SPECIES BELOW THE CANOPY AT SITES WITH >8-YEAR BURN FREQUENCIES. WE PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A HABITAT HAVE PRIMACY OVER PREY AVAILABILITY IN HABITAT CHOICE BY LARGE AND FAST-FLYING SPECIES OF BATS.

HOWEVER, THROUGH LACK OF APPROPRIATE MONITORING, THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. THREE UNDERPASSES AND FOUR BAT GANTRIES WERE INVESTIGATED IN NORTHERN ENGLAND. ECHOLOCATION CALL RECORDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF BATS USING UNDERPASSES IN PREFERENCE TO CROSSING THE ROAD ABOVE, AND THE HEIGHT AT WHICH BATS CROSSED. AT GANTRIES, PROXIMITY TO THE GANTRY AND HEIGHT OF CROSSING BATS WERE MEASURED. DATA WERE COMPARED TO THOSE FROM ADJACENT, SEVERED COMMUTING ROUTES THAT HAD NO CROSSING STRUCTURE. AT ONE UNDERPASS 96% OF BATS FLEW THROUGH IT IN PREFERENCE TO CROSSING THE ROAD. THIS UNDERPASS WAS LOCATED ON A PRE-CONSTRUCTION COMMUTING ROUTE THAT ALLOWED BATS TO PASS WITHOUT CHANGING FLIGHT HEIGHT OR DIRECTION. AT TWO UNDERPASSES ATTEMPTS TO DIVERT BATS FROM THEIR ORIGINAL COMMUTING ROUTES WERE UNSUCCESSFUL AND BATS CROSSED THE ROAD AT THE HEIGHT OF PASSING VEHICLES. UNDERPASSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ALLOW BATS TO CROSS ROADS SAFELY IF BUILT ON PRE-CONSTRUCTION COMMUTING ROUTES. BAT GANTRIES WERE INEFFECTIVE AND USED BY A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF BATS, EVEN UP TO NINE YEARS AFTER CONSTRUCTION. MOST BATS NEAR GANTRIES CROSSED ROADS ALONG SEVERED, PRE-CONSTRUCTION COMMUTING ROUTES AT HEIGHTS THAT PUT THEM IN THE PATH OF VEHICLES. CROSSING HEIGHT WAS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH VERGE HEIGHT, SUGGESTING THAT ELEVATED VERGES MAY HAVE SOME VALUE IN MITIGATION, BUT INCREASED FLIGHT HEIGHT MAY BE AT THE COST OF REDUCED PERMEABILITY.

WE SURVEYED 18 PAIRS OF AES AND CONVENTIONALLY-MANAGED FARMS IN CENTRAL SCOTLAND (UNITED KINGDOM) TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC AES MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTIONS (FIELD MARGINS, HEDGEROWS, SPECIES-RICH GRASSLANDS AND WATER MARGINS) ON FORAGING BATS AND NOCTURNAL INSECTS. IN ADDITION, WE ASSESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF HABITAT IN THE WIDER LANDSCAPE AT SEVERAL SPATIAL SCALES ON FORAGING BATS AND THEIR INSECT PREY. PIPISTRELLUS PYGMAEUS AND PIPISTRELLUS PIPISTRELLUS WERE THE MOST COMMONLY RECORDED SPECIES, ACCOUNTING FOR 98\% OF TOTAL BAT ACTIVITY LEVELS. OVERALL LEVELS OF BAT ACTIVITY AND THE ABUNDANCE OF THEIR INSECT PREY (MAINLY DIPTERA AND TRICHOPTERA) WERE LOWER (BY 40-50\%) ON FARMS PARTICIPATING IN AES THAN ON NON-PARTICIPATING FARMS. DIFFERENCES IN INSECT ABUNDANCE WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT WHEN WE COMPARED SPECIFIC AES MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTIONS WITH EQUIVALENT CONVENTIONALLY-MANAGED FEATURES. THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE INFLUENCED BAT ACTIVITY; FRAGMENTATION METRICS RELATED TO WOODLAND CONFIGURATION WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS INFLUENCING BAT ACTIVITY LEVELS. HOWEVER, THE TWO PIPISTRELLE SPECIES RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE, P. PIPISTRELLUS BEING STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE LANDSCAPE AT LARGE SCALES (E.G.

INSECT ABUNDANCE WAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PERCENTAGE COVER OF SEMI-NATURAL ENVIRONMENT WITHIN 500 M OF TRAPPING SITES. WE SUGGEST THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FOUR COMMON AES MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTIONS ASSESSED IN THIS STUDY DOES NOT BENEFIT PIPISTRELLE BATS NOR OTHER BAT SPECIES FORAGING ON SIMILAR PREY.

SMALL TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES, MANY OF WHICH ARE ADAPTED TO OPEN DESERT HABITATS, ARE DECLINING. ONE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE INVASIVE PLANTS CONTRIBUTE TO THE DECLINE BY ALTERING VEGETATIVE STRUCTURE. ALTHOUGH CATTLE MAY HAVE ORIGINALLY BEEN A FACTOR IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THESE NON-NATIVE PLANTS, THEIR GRAZING MAY BENEFIT THE TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES BY MAINTAINING AN OPEN STRUCTURE, ESPECIALLY DURING AVERAGE OR WET WINTERS WHEN THE EXOTIC GRASSES GROW ESPECIALLY DENSE. WE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED THE EFFECT OF CATTLE GRAZING ON INVASIVE PLANTS AND A COMMUNITY OF SMALL VERTEBRATES AT A SITE IN THE SOUTHWESTERN SAN JOAQUIN DESERT. WE ESTABLISHED AND MONITORED 4 TREATMENT (GRAZED) AND 4 CONTROL (UNGRAZED) PLOTS FROM 1997 TO 2006, AND ASSESSED THE ABUNDANCES OF BLUNT-NOSED LEOPARD LIZARDS (GAMBELIA SILA), GIANT KANGAROO RATS (DIPODOMYS INGENS), SHORT-NOSED KANGAROO RATS (DIPODOMYS NITRATOIDES NITRATOIDES), AND SAN JOAQUIN ANTELOPE SQUIRRELS (AMMOSPERMOPHILUS NELSONI), ALL OF WHICH ARE LISTED AS THREATENED OR ENDANGERED BY STATE OR FEDERAL AGENCIES. WE ALSO RECORDED ABUNDANCES OF THE NON-PROTECTED WESTERN WHIPTAIL LIZARDS (ASPIDOSCELIS TIGRIS), SIDE-BLOTCHED LIZARDS (UTA STANSBURIANA), SAN JOAQUIN POCKET MICE (PEROGNATHUS INORNATUS INORNATUS), AND HEERMANN'S KANGAROO RATS (DIPDOMYS HEERMANNI). BASED ON REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) AND A 0.05 ALPHA LEVEL, ONLY HEERMANN'S KANGAROO RATS SHOWED A TREATMENT EFFECT; THEY WERE MORE ABUNDANT ON THE CONTROL PLOTS. HOWEVER, THIS EFFECT COULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE NATURAL RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF SALTBUSH (ATRIPLEX SPP.) ON PART OF THE STUDY SITE. SALTBUSH RETURN ALSO FAVORED WESTERN WHIPTAIL LIZARDS AND SAN JOAQUIN ANTELOPE SQUIRRELS. A REGRESSION ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT POPULATIONS OF BLUNT-NOSED LEOPARD LIZARD AND GIANT KANGAROO RAT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER IN GRAZED PLOTS THAN THE UNGRAZED CONTROLS, AND ABUNDANCES OF 6 OF 8 SPECIES WERE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH INCREASED RESIDUAL DRY MATTER. WITH RELAXED ALPHA VALUES TO DECREASE TYPE II ERROR, POPULATIONS OF BLUNT-NOSED LEOPARD LIZARDS (500% GREATER), SAN JOAQUIN ANTELOPE SQUIRRELS (85% GREATER), AND SHORT-NOSED KANGAROO RATS (73% GREATER) INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY ON GRAZED PLOTS OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY COMPARED TO UNGRAZED PLOTS. WE DID NOT FIND GRAZING TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT ABUNDANCE OF ANY SPECIES WE STUDIED. WHEN HERBACEOUS COVER IS LOW DURING YEARS OF BELOW AVERAGE RAINFALL IN DESERTS AND OTHER ARID AREAS, GRAZING MAY NOT BE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN POPULATIONS OF SMALL VERTEBRATES. HOWEVER, IF CATTLE GRAZING IS CLOSELY MONITORED IN SPACE AND TIME TO MINIMIZE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE HABITAT, IT COULD BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO CONTROL DENSE STANDS OF NON-NATIVE GRASSES AND BENEFIT NATIVE WILDLIFE. © 2011 THE WILDLIFE SOCIETY.",2

ARBOREAL ACTIVITIES WERE MORE COMMON EARLY IN THE EXCURSIONS AND INTERACTION WITH CAREGIVERS MORE COMMON LATER (H 1: 0.3% OF TIME; H 5: 0.9% OF TIME).

SOME ARE CONFISCATED AND REHABILITATED, THEN KEPT IN SANCTUARIES OR REINTRODUCED INTO THE WILD. PRIOR TO REINTRODUCTION, THE ABILITY OF THE ORPHANS TO SURVIVE INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED. HERE, WE PERFORMED A MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, INCLUDING DIET COMPOSITION, ACTIVITY-BUDGET, AND PATTERN OF STRATA USING OF A GROUP OF FIVE JUVENILE WLG IN THE PROCESS OF REHABILITATION AND DISTINGUISHED THREE SUB-PERIODS OF ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: THE HIGH FURGIVORY PERIOD, THE DIALIUM FRUITS CONSUMPTION PERIOD, AND THE HIGH FOLIVORY PERIOD. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE VARIATIONS ON THEIR WELL-BEING (PLAY BEHAVIOUR) AND THE GROUP COHESION (SPATIAL PROXIMITY AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS) WERE EXAMINED. LIKE WILD WLGS, DIETS SHIFTED SEASONALLY FROM FRUGIVOROUS TO FOLIVOROUS, WHILE THE SAME STAPLE FOODS WERE CONSUMED AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF DIALIUM FRUITS WERE SEASONALLY GATHERED HIGH IN TREES. WHEN SUCCULENT FRUIT INTAKE WAS THE HIGHEST, THUS PROVIDING HIGH ENERGY FROM SUGAR, JUVENILES SPENT LESS TIME FEEDING, MORE TIME PLAYING AND GROUP COHESION WAS THE HIGHEST. CONVERSELY, THE COHESION DECREASED WITH INCREASING FOLIVORY, INDIVIDUALS SPENT MORE TIME FEEDING AND LESS TIME PLAYING TOGETHER. NONETHELESS, THE GROUP COHESION ALSO DECREASED AFTER THE DEATH OF ONE HIGHLY SOCIAL, WILD-BORN ORPHAN.

IN ENGLAND, THIS OBLIGATION HAS RESULTED IN LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS FOR DEROGATION FROM STRICT PROTECTION UNDER LICENSE, PROVIDED ACTIVITIES ARE UNDERTAKEN TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON BAT NUMBERS. WE USED AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH TO ASSESS THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND THE ENGLISH BAT-DEROGATION LICENSING PROCESS AS A WHOLE.

GREEN ROOFS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN HIGHLY URBANIZED AREAS SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY (NYC), WHICH HAS MORE ROOFTOPS (34\%) THAN GREEN SPACE (13\%). TO DATE, NO STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EXTENT TO WHICH NORTH AMERICAN BATS UTILIZE URBAN GREEN ROOFS. TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF GREEN ROOFS IN SUPPORTING URBAN BATS, WE MONITORED BAT ACTIVITY USING ULTRASONIC RECORDERS ON FOUR GREEN AND FOUR CONVENTIONAL ROOFS LOCATED IN HIGHLY DEVELOPED AREAS OF NYC, WHICH WERE PAIRED TO CONTROL FOR LOCATION, HEIGHT, AND LOCAL VARIABILITY IN SURROUNDING HABITAT AND SPECIES DIVERSITY.

AIMS WE INVESTIGATED THE USE OF YOUNG (4–11 YEARS OLD) TIMBER PLANTATIONS BY BATS IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER VEGETATION CLASSES IN A HIGHLY CLEARED AND PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE IN NORTH-WEST NEW SOUTH WALES (NSW), AUSTRALIA. METHODS INITIALLY, WE RECORDED ACTIVITY IN PADDOCKS BEFORE PLANTATION ESTABLISHMENT, AND THEN FOUR TO SIX YEARS AFTER ESTABLISHMENT. WE COMPARED ACTIVITY WITHIN YOUNG EUCALYPT PLANTATIONS WITH SURROUNDING PADDOCKS AND REMNANT WOODLAND. WE ALSO RADIO-TRACKED FOUR DIFFERENT BAT SPECIES TO INVESTIGATE HOW ROOSTING AND FORAGING WAS APPORTIONED INTO DIFFERENT HABITATS. KEY RESULTS THE ULTRASONIC SURVEY OF BATS FOUND THAT THE YOUNG PLANTATIONS WERE TYPICALLY USED BY 7–8 SPECIES AND ACTIVITY AVERAGED 87 PASSES PER NIGHT. ACTIVITY WITHIN PLANTATIONS WAS SIMILAR TO TREELESS PADDOCKS, AND APPROXIMATELY SIX TIMES LESS THAN IN SMALL REMNANTS. THE VERY HIGH ACTIVITY LEVELS AND FEEDING BUZZES IN SMALL REMNANTS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO RICH, BASALT SOIL (WHICH WAS USED AS A PROXY FOR INVERTEBRATE BIOMASS) ON AGRICULTURAL PLAINS. TOTAL ACTIVITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS WAS CORRELATED POSITIVELY WITH THE NUMBER OF REMNANT TREES ON THE SITE, BUT NEITHER PLANTATION AREA NOR SHAPE INFLUENCED BAT ACTIVITY. PLANTATIONS WERE NOT USED PREFERENTIALLY BY RADIO-TRACKED BATS AT NIGHT COMPARED WITH THEIR AVAILABILITY IN THE LOCAL LANDSCAPE (13–14% BAT USE, 17% AVAILABLE). NO BAT ROOSTS WERE LOCATED WITHIN THE PLANTATIONS. MOST BAT ROOSTS WERE IN TREE HOLLOWS, WHICH WERE ABSENT IN THE PLANTATIONS. DECORTICATING BARK WAS ABUNDANT IN EUCALYPT PLANTATIONS, BUT ONLY NYCTOPHILUS GEOFFROYI WAS OBSERVED BENEATH BARK AND ONLY IN REMNANT TREES OUTSIDE OF PLANTATIONS. CONCLUSIONS YOUNG EUCALYPT PLANTATIONS HAVE LIMITED VALUE FOR BATS, AND THIS IS COMPARABLE TO PREVIOUS STUDIES ON MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FOCUSSED PLANTINGS.

THIS STUDY EXAMINED PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF MICROBAT ASSEMBLAGES IN RELATION TO THE COMPTON ROAD FAUNA OVERPASS.

BAT ACTIVITY ON THE OVERPASS WAS HIGHER THAN IN THE ADJOINING FOREST, WITH HIGHER DETECTABILITY. SPECIES RICHNESS AND ACTIVITY AT THE ROADSIDE WHERE THE OVERPASS WAS PRESENT WAS ALSO HIGHER THAN THE UNVEGETATED ROADSIDE.

THE VEGETATION ON THE OVERPASS IS LIKELY TO BE THE KEY FACTOR ENCOURAGING MICROBAT ACTIVITY. THE COMPTON ROAD OVERPASS APPEARS TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF ROAD PRESENCE AND MAY FACILITATE PERMEABILITY OF A MAJOR ROAD, SUGGESTING POTENTIAL FOR ENHANCING HABITAT CONNECTIVITY AND FACILITATING CROSSINGS.

THE PRESENT STUDY CONFIRMS THAT, IN THE NORTHEAST AREAS OF PORTUGAL, THE MAJORITY OF BAT SPECIES USE ARTIFICIAL BODIES OF WATER FOR EITHER DRINKING OR FORAGING, BUT SPECIES DIFFERED IN TERMS OF THEIR ACTIVITY LEVELS OVER THE RESERVOIRS WHEN COMPARED WITH INTACT STREAM HABITATS. AS PREDICTED, SMALL DAMS IN THE STUDY AREA WERE IMPORTANT CENTERS OF OVERALL BAT ACTIVITY RELATIVE TO OTHER SAMPLING AREAS. AT THE SAME TIME, FEEDING ACTIVITY WAS ALSO HIGHER IN THE FLOODED AREAS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT PIPISTRELLUS PIPISTRELLUS, MYOTIS DAUBENTONII, PIPISTRELLUS KUHLII, PIPISTRELLUS PYGMAEUS/MINIOPTERUS SCHREIBERSII, TADARIDA TENIOTIS AND NYCTALUS LEISLERI/EPTESICUS SEROTINUS BENEFITED FROM THE PRESENCE OF DAM RESERVOIRS. HYPSUGO SAVII ACTIVITY WAS ALSO MOSTLY RECORDED AT RESERVOIR POINTS. HOWEVER, THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF ENDANGERED AND RARE SPECIES WAS RECORDED AT AN INTACT STREAM HABITAT. THIS RESULT EMPHASIZES THE RELEVANCE OF RIPARIAN HABITATS FOR BATS, ESPECIALLY FOR THE MOST ENDANGERED SPECIES. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DAM AVAILABILITY, RIPARIAN QUALITY AND BAT DIVERSITY SUGGESTED THAT THE CHANGES IN THE STREAMS PROMOTED BY DAMMING COULD AFFECT BOTH BAT SPECIES RICHNESS AND ACTIVITY LEVELS, LEADING TO CHANGES IN THE OVERALL COMPOSITION OF THE BAT COMMUNITY. IN CONCLUSION, THIS STUDY FOUND THAT SMALL RESERVOIRS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON BAT ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, DAMS APPEAR TO PRIMARILY BENEFIT THE MOST COMMON SPECIES, WHILE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH RIPARIAN HABITATS. THEREFORE, FOR CONSERVATION PROPOSES OF THE LOCAL BAT COMMUNITY, RIPARIAN AREAS APPEAR TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN RESERVOIRS. THUS, THIS STUDY PROVIDES A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF SMALL DAMS ON BATS CONTRIBUTING TO THE FUTURE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF BAT SPECIES.",1

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THESE INVASIVE PREDATORS ON BATS (CHIROPTERA), ONE OF THE MOST SPECIOUS MAMMAL GROUPS, AND ONE OF THE MOST WIDESPREAD GROUPS OF MAMMALS THREATENED ON OCEANIC ISLANDS (> 200 SPP.). NEARLY 50\% OF THE WORLD'S THREATENED BATS ARE ISLAND ENDEMICS AND BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN THE ONLY NATIVE MAMMALS ON ISLANDS, THEY FULFIL IMPORTANT ECOLOGICAL ROLES SUCH AS POLLINATION AND SEED DISPERSAL. LONG-TAILED BATS (CHALINOLOBUS TUBERCULATUS) ARE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED BECAUSE OF PREDATION BY EXOTIC MAMMALS, PARTICULARLY SHIP RATS (RATTUS RATIOS), INTRODUCED BY HUMANS TO THE ISLAND ARCHIPELAGO OF NEW ZEALAND. WE MONITORED THE SURVIVAL OF BATS IN THREE COLONIES IN TEMPERATE RAINFOREST IN FIORDLAND OVER 22 YEARS. SINCE 2009, WE CONTROLLED PREDATORS DURING IRRUPTION PHASES AND COMPARED SURVIVAL OF BATS IN PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED AREAS WITH SURVIVAL IN FOREST BLOCKS TREATED USING RODENTICIDES DEPLOYED IN BAIT STATIONS. SURVIVAL WAS ESTIMATED USING MULTI-STATE MARK-RECAPTURE MODELS IN PROGRAM MARK 7.0 WITH > 15,000 BATS TAGGED. SURVIVAL WAS PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON YEAR AND AGE OF BATS, ALTHOUGH SEEDFALL INTENSITY OF THE DOMINANT CANOPY TREE AND PREDATOR MANAGEMENT WAS ALSO INFLUENTIAL. SURVIVAL IN LONG-TAILED BATS WAS AS HIGH AS, OR HIGHER, THAN FIGURES FOR BATS GENERALLY IN YEARS WITH LOW PREDATOR NUMBERS OR PREDATOR CONTROL. SURVIVAL WAS MARKEDLY HIGHER IN TREATMENT YEARS WHEN PREDATORS WERE MANAGED (0.82 COMPARED TO 0.55). POPULATION MODELLING INDICATED MANAGED COLONIES WILL INCREASE (LAMBDA > 1.05) WHEREAS UNMANAGED COLONIES WILL DECLINE (LAMBDA = 0.89 - 0.98) UNDER SCENARIOS THAT REFLECT INCREASED FREQUENCY OF BEECH MAST AND PREDATOR IRRUPTIONS. THUS, EFFECTIVE PREDATOR CONTROL IS ESSENTIAL FOR RECOVERING LONG-TAILED BAT POPULATIONS. WARMING TEMPERATURES INDICATE THAT PREDATOR IRRUPTIONS ARE BECOMING MORE FREQUENT, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE MORE PREDATOR CONTROL IN THE FUTURE THAN AT PRESENT IF DECLINES IN BAT POPULATIONS ARE TO BE REVERSED.

HOWEVER, KNOWLEDGE OF THE EFFECTS OF OLIVE FARMING ON ANIMAL SPECIES STILL REMAINS ELUSIVE AND CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR THE RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS ARE THEREFORE URGENTLY NEEDED. HERE, WE INVESTIGATE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND ACTIVITY PATTERNS OF INSECTIVOROUS BATS IN MEDITERRANEAN OLIVE MONOCULTURES IN SOUTHERN PORTUGAL. BATS SURVEYS WERE CARRIED OUT IN THREE TYPES OF OLIVE FARMS REPRESENTING INCREASING LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT INTENSITY: (1) TRADITIONAL OLIVE FARMS, MANAGED WITH FEW OR NO CHEMICAL INPUTS OR MANUAL LABOR (2) SEMI-INTENSIVE OLIVE FARMS, WHICH SHARE CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS WITH TRADITIONAL PLANTATIONS, BUT ARE MORE INTENSIVELY MANAGED; (3) INTENSIVE OLIVE FARMS, WHICH ARE MANAGED WITH HIGH AND FREQUENT CHEMICAL INPUTS, AND HIGHLY MECHANIZED SYSTEMS. WE FOUND DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES RICHNESS AND ACTIVITY LEVELS BETWEEN FARMING PRACTICES. BOTH THE NUMBER OF SPECIES AND FORAGING ACTIVITY DECLINED WITH INCREASING MANAGEMENT INTENSITY.

THE HABITAT FILTERING FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN USED FOR PREDICTING SPECIES RESPONSES TO LAND-USE CHANGES. HABITAT FILTERS ARE ESSENTIALLY FEATURES THAT MAY SLOW, OR LIMIT, SPECIES USE OF CERTAIN HABITATS. WE WANTED TO DETERMINE IF THIS FRAMEWORK COULD IDENTIFY HABITAT AND LANDSCAPE FILTERS THAT PREDICTED BAT USE OF RESTORED FOREST AT THE SPECIES-SPECIFIC AND TRAIT GROUP LEVELS. WE SURVEYED BAT ACTIVITY, VEGETATION STRUCTURE, AND LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS AT 64 SITES OVER TWO YEARS IN RESTORED NORTHERN JARRAH (EUCALYPTUS MARGINATA) FORESTS OF SOUTH-WESTERN AUSTRALIA. FILTERS TO USE OF RESTORED FOREST WERE PRESENT FOR ALL BATS, OTHER THAN THE OPEN SPACE GROUP. WE DETECTED DYNAMIC FILTERS TO USE OF RESTORED FOREST BY THE OPEN SPACE EDGE GROUP AND UNIDIRECTIONAL FILTERS FOR THE CLOSED SPACE EDGE AND CLOSED SPACE GROUPS. FILTERS TO BAT USE OF RESTORED FORESTS WERE SPECIES-SPECIFIC AND RELATED TO HABITAT, RATHER THAN LANDSCAPE, FEATURES. IN LANDSCAPES WITH RELATIVELY LOW PATCH-MATRIX CONTRAST, SUCH AS THE NORTHERN JARRAH FOREST, MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TO REDUCE FILTERS SHOULD FOCUS ON HABITAT FEATURES.

WE COMBINED ACOUSTIC MONITORING OF BAT ACTIVITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL BODIES OF WATER IN THE NEGEV DESERT, ISRAEL AND MEASURED 27 VARIABLES OF WATER CHEMISTRY AND QUALITY AT EACH SITE. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN WATER CHEMISTRY AND QUALITY WERE FOUND BETWEEN NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL BODIES OF WATER.

BATS, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE BEEN STRONGLY IMPACTED BY AGRICULTURE INTENSIFICATION, MAINLY THROUGH THE DESTRUCTION OF FORESTS AND NATURAL WETLANDS. HOWEVER, ARTIFICIAL WETLANDS CREATED PRIMARILY FOR IRRIGATION IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES MAY PROVIDE FORAGING HABITATS FOR BATS AND THUS CONTRIBUTE TO BOTH THE CONSERVATION OF BAT SPECIES AND THE REGULATION OF INSECT PEST SPECIES. WE STUDIED THE INFLUENCE OF ARTIFICIAL WETLANDS ON BAT COMMUNITIES IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES IN SOUTH AFRICA. WE USED MIXED MODELS TO ASSESS SPATIAL VARIATIONS IN SPECIES RICHNESS, TOTAL BAT ACTIVITY, AND SPECIES ACTIVITY ACROSS 30 LANDSCAPES. EACH STUDY SITE WAS CENTRED ON A 'FOCAL WETLAND' AND SURROUNDED BY VARIOUS HABITAT CATEGORIES: OPEN HABITAT, VINEYARDS, ORCHARDS AND TREES.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE HOW THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AFFECTS BAT BOX OCCUPANCY IN URBAN NON-NATIVE FORESTS ALONG THE MEDITERRANEAN CORRIDOR IN THE NORTHEASTERN IBERIAN PENINSULA. TWO HUNDRED WOODEN BAT BOXES WERE MONITORED IN YOUNG NON-NATIVE FORESTS IN THE PERIOD 2004–2012. THE INFLUENCE OF LAND COVER ON OCCUPANCY RATE OF BAT BOXES WAS ANALYSED AT THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL IN A 5 KM BUFFER AROUND BAT-BOX STATIONS. IN TOTAL, 1659 INSPECTIONS WERE CARRIED OUT, IN WHICH A 15 % OCCUPANCY RATE WAS DETECTED. BAT BOXES HOSTED THREE DIFFERENT SPECIES (PIPISTRELLUS PYGMAEUS, PIPISTRELLUS KUHLII AND NYCTALUS LEISLERI). MORE THAN 70 % OF THE OCCUPANCY CAN BE EXPLAINED BY HABITAT AND SPATIAL COMPOSITION. THE PRESENCE OF URBAN AREAS AROUND BAT BOXES TENDS TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BAT OCCUPATION RATES; BY CONTRAST, FOREST COVERAGE HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT, ESPECIALLY FOR THE TREE-DWELLING BATS. THESE PATTERNS COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LARGE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE ROOSTS IN BUILDINGS, MICROHABITAT OR PHYLOPATRY.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE DRAG-GENERATED, NETTING TENSION OF THE W TRAWL IS DIRECTED AWAY FROM THE WINGS TO CENTRE-LINE BRACING ROPES THAT ARE CONNECTED TO A CENTRAL TOWING WIRE THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY SLED. THIS CONFIGURATION FACILITATES SUBSTANTIALLY SMALLER OTTER BOARDS THAN NORMAL, AND CONSEQUENTLY LESS DRAG AND SEABED CONTACT. HERE WE COMPARED THE ENGINEERING AND CATCHING IMPLICATIONS OF SUBTLE, PROGRESSIVE RIGGING CHANGES TO A W TRAWL PAIRED AGAINST A STANDARD FLORIDA FLYER TRAWL; BOTH RIGGED WITH ANOTHER ECO-EFFICIENT MODIFICATION, TERMED THE 'BATWING' OTTER BOARD (SUITABLY SIZED FOR EACH TRAWL).

POTS HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED AS AN ALTERNATIVE FISHING METHOD THAT WOULD REDUCE THE HIGH LEVELS OF FISH BYCATCH IN THE NEW ZEALAND SCAMPI (METANEPHROPS CHALLENGERI) TRAWL FISHERY. THIS HYPOTHESIS WAS ASSESSED BY COMPARING THE BYCATCH RATES FROM FOUR DIFFERENT DESIGNS OF POTS USED IN SIMILAR DEEP SEA LOBSTER FISHERIES OVERSEAS.

THE POT DESIGN WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF BYCATCH AT BOTH SITES WAS POT 2, A TWO-CHAMBERED PARLOUR POT WHICH CAUGHT BETWEEN 1.5–10.1 TIMES MORE TOTAL BYCATCH THAN THE OTHER POT DESIGNS. ADDITIONALLY, BOTH HAGFISH AND TOTAL BYCATCH SHOWED SIGNIFICANT SPATIAL VARIATION AT TWO SCALES; AMONG INDIVIDUAL DEPLOYMENTS OF STRINGS OF POTS WITHIN LOCATIONS, AND AMONG LOCATIONS WITHIN THE SITES. THE BYCATCH FROM THE POTS INCLUDED PROPORTIONATELY MORE INVERTEBRATES AND HAGFISH, AND LESS OTHER FISH SPECIES WHEN COMPARED TO PREVIOUS STUDIES ANALYSING THE BYCATCH OF THE TRAWL FISHERY FOR NEW ZEALAND SCAMPI.

OUR THREE MEASURES OF DIVERSITY WERE BASED ON THE ABUNDANCE OF ALGAE, FISH, SESSILE AND MOBILE INVERTEBRATES IN SHALLOW WATER ROCKY COMMUNITIES AND COULD BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE RESERVE EFFECT BASED ON SPECIES, TROPHIC LEVELS, OR FUNCTIONAL ROLES.

SEVERAL STUDIES REPORTED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF ORGANIC COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL FARMING ON BAT POPULATIONS AND ON NOCTURNAL INSECT PREY ABUNDANCE. WE REGISTERED THE FLIGHT AND FEEDING ACTIVITY OF 12 BAT SPECIES IN RICE PADDIES IN NORTHWESTERN ITALY TO TEST THE EFFECT OF WETLAND FARM MANAGEMENT AND AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION ON BATS HABITAT USE. OUR STUDY EVALUATED THE DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL ROLES OF ORGANIC VS CONVENTIONAL RICE FARMS AND NATURAL WETLANDS IN CONSERVATION OF BAT SPECIES. FOR THE 12 SPECIES UNDER STUDY, FLYING ACTIVITY WAS RECORDED IN ALL THREE LAND MANAGEMENT TYPES. ONLY THE GENUS PIPISTRELLUS HUNTED IN CONVENTIONAL AND ORGANIC FARMS.

BATS FED IN ORGANIC FARMS AS WELL AS IN NATURAL WETLANDS, WHEREAS THEY WERE UNLIKELY TO FORAGE IN CONVENTIONAL FARMS. CONVENTIONAL RICE PADDIES DO NOT PROVIDE IDEAL FORAGING SITES FOR BATS, LIKELY DUE TO THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PESTICIDES, WATER MANAGEMENT, AND INTENSIVE WEED CONTROL ON EMBANKMENTS. ORGANIC RICE PADDIES, DUE TO THE LESS AGGRESSIVE MANAGEMENT, APPEAR TO HAVE A HIGHER HABITAT QUALITY COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL ONES, AND ARE THEREFORE MORE SUITABLE FOR FEEDING ACTIVITIES, POSSIBLY DUE TO THE GREATER AVAILABILITY OF PREY. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE LIMITED ECOLOGICAL VALUE OF CONVENTIONAL FARMS FOR BAT CONSERVATION IS CONFIRMED IN THIS RESEARCH FOR RICE PADDIES, FURTHER EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO PRESERVE NATURAL WETLANDS.

IN STUDIED CONVENTIONAL FIELDS, DIFFERENCES CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING: TILLAGE USING FEW HERBICIDES (T), CONSERVATION TILLAGE (I.E., NO INVERSION OF SOIL) USING FEW HERBICIDES (CT), AND CONSERVATION TILLAGE USING MORE HERBICIDE (CTH), TO CONTROL WEEDS. USING 64 RECORDING SITES (OT = 12; T = 21; CT = 13; CTH = 18), WE SAMPLED SEVERAL SITES PER SYSTEM PLACED INSIDE THE FIELDS EACH NIGHT.

BATS ARE IMPORTANT PREDATORS OF AGRICULTURAL PESTS, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW PRESCRIPTIVE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT BATS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED PEST-SUPPRESSION SERVICES.

CROP DIVERSIFICATION INCREASED THE ACTIVITY OF ALL BAT SPECIES AND CLUTTER-ADAPTED, BUT NOT OPEN SPACE BATS, REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT SURROUNDING FARMS. BOTH CROP DIVERSIFICATION AND LESS FREQUENT PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS INCREASED PREY BIOMASS, AND THE ACTIVITY OF CLUTTER-ADAPTED BATS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH GREATER LEPIDOPTERA BIOMASS.

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

SPECIES-SPECIFIC RESPONSES TO GATES APPEARED BASED ON MORPHOLOGY AND VOCALIZATION CHARACTERISTICS. RESPONSES TO GATES SHIFTED FROM NEGATIVE IN OUR SHORT-TERM STUDY TO POSITIVE IN OUR LONG-TERM STUDY. GATE AGE AND MINE CHARACTERISTICS WERE MORE IMPORTANT PREDICTORS OF USE FOR MOST SPECIES THAN GATE DESIGN. ALTHOUGH THE COMPLEXITY OF SUBTERRANEAN HABITATS MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO REPLICATE AND MANY FACTORS MAY INFLUENCE HOW BATS USE THIS HABITAT, GATES DESIGNED FOR BATS (BAT-COMPATIBLE) APPEAR EFFECTIVE FOR MANY SPECIES. © 2018 THE WILDLIFE SOCIETY. © THE WILDLIFE SOCIETY, 2018",1

OVER A STUDY PERIOD OF TWO YEARS (2012-2013), A STANDARDISED ACOUSTIC MONITORING WAS CONDUCTED ON 12 SAMPLING SITES COMPRISING DIFFERENT LAND USE TYPES IN FORESTS (PINE, MIXED AND DECIDUOUS FOREST) AND AGRICULTURAL AREAS (ARABLE LAND AND GRASSLAND). THE FOCUS WAS ON THE EFFECT OF SMALL-SCALE CHANGES IN STRUCTURAL HABITAT PARAMETERS RESULTING FROM MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WITHIN ONE-AND-THE-SAME LAND USE TYPE. WE APPLIED A PAIRED SAMPLING DESIGN AND COMPARED TWO (FOREST) AND THREE (AGRICULTURAL AREAS) SAMPLING SITES (COMPLEXITY CATEGORIES) PER LAND USE TYPE. AN EFFECT OF STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY WAS TESTED USING PARAMETRIC AND NON-PARAMETRIC ANALYSES. SAMPLING SITES DIFFER IN A COMPLEXITY INDEX DERIVED FROM VEGETATION MEASUREMENTS RELATED TO: A) VERTICAL VEGETATION STRUCTURE (PINE FORESTS), B) TREE SPECIES COMPOSITION (MIXED FORESTS), C) TREE AGE (DECIDUOUS FORESTS), D) CROP TYPE (ARABLE LAND), AND E) MANAGEMENT INTENSITY (GRASSLAND). WITHIN THE PINE AND MIXED FOREST, MANAGEMENT PRACTICES LEADING TO AN INCREASE IN STRUCTURAL HABITAT COMPLEXITY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BAT ACTIVITY, SPECIES RICHNESS, AND SPECIES DIVERSITY (H'). THIS EFFECT IS ONLY PARTIALLY EXPLAINED BY INCREASED PREY ABUNDANCE. ON GRASSLAND, INCREASED BAT ABUNDANCE IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW-INTENSITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

WE FOUND THAT THREE OF THE SIX TAXA STUDIED EXHIBIT GREATER RELATIVE ABUNDANCE WITHIN NATURA 2000 SITES (THIS INCREASE IS NOTEWORTHY FOR E. SEROTINUS (× 2.1) AND MYOTIS SSP. (× 3.6)). WE ALSO PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT TOTAL RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF BAT ACTIVITY AND RICHNESS ARE GLOBALLY HIGHER IN NATURA 2000 SITES (RESPECTIVELY + 24% AND + 14%) AND ON AVERAGE COMMUNITIES ARE MORE SPECIALIZED WITHIN NATURA 2000 SITES. IN ADDITION, WHEN THE EFFECT OF NATURA 2000 IS ADJUSTED TO THE MAIN LAND USE TYPES, A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT OF NATURA 2000 REMAINS FOR MOST METRICS. THE POSITIVE NATURA 2000 EFFECT APPEARS RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED TO THE MAIN LAND USE PRESSURE: INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE AND ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AT NIGHT.

IN OUR STUDY, ACOUSTIC METHODS BASED ON RECORDING ECHOLOCATION CALLS DETECTED GREATER BAT ACTIVITY AND MORE SPECIES THAN MIST-NETTING. HOWEVER, SOME SPECIES WERE DETECTED MORE FREQUENTLY OR EXCLUSIVELY BY CAPTURE. IDEALLY, THE TWO METHODS SHOULD BE USED TOGETHER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE BIASES IN EACH. USING COMBINED CAPTURE AND ACOUSTIC DATA, WE FOUND THAT PROTECTED FORESTS, FOREST FRAGMENTS, AND SHADE COFFEE PLANTATIONS HOSTED SIMILAR AND DIVERSE SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES, ALTHOUGH SOME SPECIES WERE RECORDED MORE FREQUENTLY IN PROTECTED FORESTS. TEA PLANTATIONS CONTAINED VERY FEW SPECIES FROM THE OVERALL BAT ASSEMBLAGE. IN RIPARIAN HABITATS, A STRIP OF FORESTED HABITAT ON THE RIVER BANK IMPROVED THE HABITAT FOR BATS COMPARED TO RIVERS WITH TEA PLANTED UP TO EACH BANK. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT SHADE COFFEE PLANTATIONS ARE BETTER BAT HABITAT THAN TEA PLANTATIONS IN BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS. HOWEVER, IF TEA IS TO BE THE DOMINANT LAND USE, FOREST FRAGMENTS AND RIPARIAN CORRIDORS CAN IMPROVE THE LANDSCAPE CONSIDERABLY FOR BATS.

TO EVALUATE MICROHABITAT DIFFERENCES IN COMMON ARTIFICIAL ROOST STRUCTURES AND DETERMINE IF ROOST SELECTION OCCURS BASED ON STRUCTURE TYPE, WE INSTALLED ARTIFICIAL ROOSTS OF THREE DIFFERENT STYLES (BAT BOX, ROCKET BOX, AND BARK MIMIC) IN SIX CLUSTERS. WE COMPARED SIZE AND MEASURED TEMPERATURE PARAMETERS (12 POINTS/ROOST) WHILE BATS WERE EXCLUDED FROM ONE CLUSTER. WE SIMULTANEOUSLY CONDUCTED CENSUS COUNTS DURING THE ACTIVE SEASON AT FIVE MORE CLUSTERS OPEN TO BATS FOR 1-2 YEARS. THE ROCKET BOX STYLE PROVIDED LARGER ENTRANCE AREA, SURFACE AREA, AND VOLUME VERSUS OTHER ROOST TYPES. MICROCLIMATE VARIED WITH ROOST DESIGN. MORE POSITIONS INSIDE THE BAT BOX AND ROCKET BOX STAYED WITHIN CRITICAL TEMPERATURE LIMITS FOR BATS (0-45&#XB0;C)-I.E., WERE USABLE. THE BARK-MIMIC PROVIDED LESS USABLE SPACE THAN THE ROCKET BOX AND, OFTEN, LARGE PROPORTIONS OF THE ROOST WERE &GT; 45&#XB0;C.

WITHIN FORESTRY, DIVERSIONARY FEEDING TYPICALLY TARGETS CERVIDS, AND AIMS TO REDUCE BROWSING DAMAGE AND BARK-STRIPPING IN VULNERABLE FOREST STANDS (YOUNG AND MID-AGED FOREST STANDS). BECAUSE THESE STANDS ARE MOST VULNERABLE DURING WINTER, DIVERSIONARY FEEING IS OFTEN RESTRICTED TO THAT SEASON. DESPITE BEING WIDELY APPLIED, CLEAR EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIVERSIONARY FEEDING OF CERVIDS IS LACKING. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIVERSIONARY WINTER FEEDING AS A TOOL TO LURE AWAY A LARGE CERVID, RED DEER (CERVUS ELAPHUS), FROM VULNERABLE FOREST STANDS. FIRST, WE HYPOTHESIZED (H1) THAT DIVERSIONARY FEEDING IS AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS EXPLAINING DIFFERENCES IN RED DEER HABITAT SELECTION BETWEEN SUMMER (I.E., NO FOOD SUPPLY AT FEEDING STATIONS) AND WINTER (I.E., FOOD SUPPLY AD LIBITUM AT FEEDING STATIONS). SECOND, WE HYPOTHESIZED (H2) THAT DIVERSIONARY FEEDING RELEASES RED DEER HABITAT SELECTION PRESSURE IN FOREST STANDS VULNERABLE FOR BROWSING OR BARK-STRIPPING, AND THAT THIS RELEASE DECAYS WITH DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST FEEDING STATION. WE TESTED OUR HYPOTHESES USING RED DEER RELOCATION DATA (11 INDIVIDUALS & 3 YEARS) AND RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTIONS IN AN INTENSIVELY MANAGED AUSTRIAN FOREST. AS EXPECTED, VARIATION IN RED DEER HABITAT SELECTION BETWEEN SUMMER AND WINTER WAS BEST EXPLAINED BY A DIFFERENT RESPONSE TO SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING STATIONS BETWEEN THE SEASONS (H1). DURING WINTER, RED DEER STRONGLY SELECTED FOR AREAS CLOSE TO FEEDING STATIONS, WHEREAS FEEDING STATIONS DID NOT STRONGLY AFFECT THEIR HABITAT SELECTION DURING SUMMER. WE FOUND THAT DIVERSIONARY FEEDING DURING WINTER RELEASED RED DEER HABITAT SELECTION PRESSURE ON VULNERABLE FOREST STANDS, BUT LIMITED TO DISTANCES OF ABOUT 1.3 TO 1.5 KM FROM THE FEEDING STATION, THIS ACCOUNTS FOR 39% OF THE STUDY AREA (H2). OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT DIVERSIONARY FEEDING CAN INDEED BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO MEDIATE HABITAT SELECTION BEHAVIOR AND TO LURE CERVIDS AWAY FROM VULNERABLE FOREST STANDS. HOWEVER, HABITAT SELECTION IS NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD PROXY FOR DAMAGE, AND WHETHER OR NOT DIVERSIONARY FEEDING REDUCES FORESTRY DAMAGE IN THE LONG-TERM REMAINS UNCLEAR, AS IT CAN POSITIVELY FEED-BACK INTO SURVIVAL, REPRODUCTION, AND EVENTUALLY POPULATION GROWTH AND DENSITIES. WE SUGGEST THAT FOREST MANAGERS ALSO CONSIDER SILVICULTURAL MEASURES, POPULATION CONTROL (I.E., HUNTING) OR SPATIAL PLANNING AS MEANS TO MINIMIZE RED DEER INDUCED FORESTRY DAMAGE. © 2017 ELSEVIER B.V.",1

IN THE YEAR STARTING IN FEBRUARY OF 2001, 29 LEOPARDS WERE CAPTURED IN THE HUMAN-DOMINATED RURAL LANDSCAPE OF THE JUNNAR REGION (4275 KM2, 185 PEOPLE/KM2), MAHARASHTRA, INDIA, AND RELEASED AN AVERAGE OF 39.5 KM AWAY IN ADJOINING FORESTS. ELEVEN LEOPARDS WERE ALSO RELOCATED TO THE SAME FORESTS FROM OTHER DISTRICTS. PRIOR TO THE LARGE-SCALE TRANSLOCATION PROGRAM, AN AVERAGE OF FOUR LEOPARD ATTACKS ON HUMANS OCCURRED EACH YEAR BETWEEN 1993 AND 2001. AFTER THE TRANSLOCATION PROGRAM WAS INITIATED, THE AVERAGE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY TO 17 ATTACKS. LINEAR AND LOGISTIC MODELS SHOWED THAT ATTACK FREQUENCY INCREASED IN JUNNAR FOLLOWING NEARBY RELEASES OF LEOPARDS AND DECREASED WHEN LEOPARDS WERE REMOVED FOR RELEASES FAR AWAY; THAT ATTACKS BECAME MORE LETHAL WHEN THE NUMBER OF LEOPARDS INTRODUCED FROM OTHER DISTRICTS INCREASED; AND THAT ATTACKS WERE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE REGIONS WHERE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF LEOPARDS HAD BEEN INTRODUCED FROM OTHER AREAS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LEOPARDS DID NOT STAY AT THE RELEASE SITES AND THAT TRANSLOCATION INDUCED ATTACKS ON PEOPLE. POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS FOR THESE RESULTS INCLUDE INCREASED AGGRESSION INDUCED BY STRESS OF THE TRANSLOCATION PROCESS, MOVEMENT THROUGH UNFAMILIAR HUMAN-DOMINATED LANDSCAPES FOLLOWING RELEASE, AND LOSS OF FEAR OF HUMANS DUE TO FAMILIARITY WITH HUMANS ACQUIRED DURING CAPTIVITY. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT REACTIVE SOLUTIONS TO ATTACKS ON HUMANS BY LEOPARDS, SUCH AS TRANSLOCATION, COULD IN FACT INCREASE HUMAN-LEOPARD CONFLICT. MEASURES TO REDUCE HUMAN-CARNIVORE CONFLICTS MAY INCLUDE MORE EFFECTIVE COMPENSATION PROCEDURES TO PAY LIVESTOCK OWNERS FOR THE LOSS OF ANIMALS TO PREDATION BY CARNIVORES, PROVIDING BETTER METHODS OF PROTECTION FOR LIVESTOCK, AND ENCOURAGING GREATER SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRESENCE OF CARNIVORES IN HUMAN-DOMINATED LANDSCAPES. © 2010 SOCIETY FOR CONSERVATION BIOLOGY.",1

PREDATION ON DOMESTIC STOCK CAN HAVE NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS PARTICULARLY FOR OWNERS OF SMALL HERDS, AND TOOLS FOR MINIMISING CARNIVORE DEPREDATION OF LIVESTOCK ARE NEEDED. CANIDS USE SCENT MARKING TO ESTABLISH TERRITORIES AND AVOID INTRASPECIFIC CONFLICT. EXPLOITING SCENT-MARKING BEHAVIOUR MAY PROVIDE A MEANS FOR MANIPULATING CANID MOVEMENTS. AIMS WE HYPOTHESISED THAT HUMAN-DEPLOYED SCENT MARKS (I.E. ‘BIOFENCE’) COULD BE USED TO MANIPULATE THE MOVEMENTS OF GREY WOLVES (CANIS LUPUS) IN IDAHO, USA. METHODS WE DEPLOYED 65 KM OF BIOFENCE WITHIN THREE WOLF-PACK TERRITORIES DURING SUMMER 2010 AND 2011 AND USED LOCATION DATA FROM SATELLITE-COLLARED WOLVES AND SIGN SURVEYS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BIOFENCING. KEY RESULTS LOCATION DATA PROVIDED BY SATELLITE-COLLARED WOLVES AND SIGN SURVEYS IN 2010 SHOWED LITTLE TO NO TRESPASS OF THE BIOFENCE, EVEN THOUGH THE EXCLUDED AREAS WERE USED BY THE PACKS IN PREVIOUS SUMMERS. WE ALSO OPPORTUNISTICALLY DEPLOYED A BIOFENCE IN BETWEEN A RENDEZVOUS SITE OF A RESIDENT PACK AND A NEARBY SHEEP GRAZING ALLOTMENT; THE PACK WAS NOT IMPLICATED IN ANY DEPREDATIONS IN SUMMER 2010, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD KILLED SHEEP EVERY YEAR SINCE 2006.

IMPLICATIONS OUR WORK SUGGESTS THAT BIOFENCING MAY BE MOST LIMITED BY THE APPARENT NECESSITY TO MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS PRESENCE ONCE THE BIOFENCE IS ESTABLISHED. THE INHERENT LABOUR AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH EFFORTS MAY LIMIT THE USEFULNESS OF BIOFENCING.

HERE WE PRESENT NEW EVIDENCE FROM THE SAME STUDY IDENTIFYING BOTH A DIRECT BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF VACCINATION IN INDIVIDUAL BADGERS AND AN INDIRECT PROTECTIVE EFFECT IN UNVACCINATED CUBS. WE SHOW THAT INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION OF BCG REDUCED BY 76% (ODDS RATIO = 0.24, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 0.11-0.52) THE RISK OF FREE-LIVING VACCINATED INDIVIDUALS TESTING POSITIVE TO A DIAGNOSTIC TEST COMBINATION TO DETECT PROGRESSIVE INFECTION. A MORE SENSITIVE PANEL OF TESTS FOR THE DETECTION OF INFECTION PER SE IDENTIFIED A REDUCTION OF 54% (ODDS RATIO = 0.46, 95% CI 0.26-0.88) IN THE RISK OF A POSITIVE RESULT FOLLOWING VACCINATION. IN ADDITION, WE SHOW THE RISK OF UNVACCINATED BADGER CUBS, BUT NOT ADULTS, TESTING POSITIVE TO AN EVEN MORE SENSITIVE PANEL OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE PROPORTION OF VACCINATED INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR SOCIAL GROUP INCREASED (ODDS RATIO = 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.76; P = 0.03). WHEN MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEIR SOCIAL GROUP HAD BEEN VACCINATED, THE RISK TO UNVACCINATED CUBS WAS REDUCED BY 79% (ODDS RATIO = 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.81; P = 0.02).",1

FOR BANDICOOTS THE MEAN WEEKLY FREQUENCY OF USE CORRECTED FOR POPULATION SIZE AND THE PROPORTION OF THE MARKED POPULATION THAT USED EACH UNDERPASS WERE MODELLED AGAINST FACTORS HYPOTHESIZED TO IMPACT UNDERPASS USE USING GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS. THESE WERE UNDERPASS LENGTH, CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA, VEGETATION COVER AT THE ENTRANCES, PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF LOGS AND BRANCHES IN THE UNDERPASS (FURNITURE), USE BY INTRODUCED PREDATORS AND TIME SINCE CONSTRUCTION. UNDERPASS LENGTH WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE FREQUENCY OF USE BY BANDICOOTS AND TIME SINCE CONSTRUCTION WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION THAT USED THE UNDERPASSES. FOR WESTERN BOBTAIL LIZARDS NONE OF THE FACTORS TESTED WERE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH THE FREQUENCY OF USE, OR THE PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION THAT USED THE UNDERPASS.

WE PREDICTED THAT THE EFFECTS OF FARMING PRACTICES ON SMALL MAMMAL POPULATIONS WOULD VARY WITH THE DEGREE OF HABITAT SPECIALIZATION OF SPECIES. WE EXPECTED HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF SPECIALIST SPECIES IN BORDER HABITATS OF ORGANIC THAN ON CONVENTIONAL FARMS. WE FOUND THAT FARMING PRACTICES DID NOT EXPLAIN SPECIES RICHNESS; THE NUMBER OF SPECIES IN BORDER HABITATS WAS LOW WITH SMALL VARIATION BETWEEN MANAGEMENTS.

WE USED HUMAN AND GRIZZLY BEAR GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM LOCATION DATA TO STUDY 6 OF 16 BMAS FROM 2007 TO 2009. WE CONTRASTED DATA WHEN BMAS WERE UNRESTRICTED (OPEN HUMAN ACCESS) AND RESTRICTED (LIMITED HUMAN ACCESS). WE USED LOCATION DATA COLLECTED WHEN BMAS WERE UNRESTRICTED TO DELINEATE A HUMAN RECREATION AREA (HRA) AND DETERMINED A DAILY HUMAN ACTIVE AND INACTIVE PERIOD.

IN 2003, WE CONSTRUCTED 4 40-HA MESOPREDATOR EXCLOSURES WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF QUANTIFYING THE INFLUENCE OF MESOPREDATORS, INCLUDING COYOTES, ON SELECT WILDLIFE POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES. CAMERA TRAPPING INDICATED NEONATE/ADULT FEMALE WHITE-TAILED DEER RATIOS WERE APPROXIMATELY 2 TIMES GREATER INSIDE PREDATOR EXCLOSURES THAN IN CONTROL PLOTS. HUNTER SUCCESS DATA PROVIDED FURTHER EVIDENCE OF INCREASED RECRUITMENT ASSOCIATED WITH EXCLOSURES RELATIVE TO THE REMAINDER OF THE STUDY SITE. BECAUSE EXCLOSURES WERE LOCATED ON THE BOUNDARY OF OUR STUDY AREA AND OFF-SITE WHITE-TAILED DEER HARVEST RECORDS WERE NOT AVAILABLE, WE USED ESTIMATES OF DEER DENSITY, SEX RATIOS, REPRODUCTIVE RATES, RELATIVE USE OF EXCLOSURES, AND NEONATE SURVIVAL INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF EXCLOSURES TO PARAMETERIZE A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF OUR 4 EXCLOSURES ON NEONATE RECRUITMENT INTO THE START OF THE FIREARMS HUNTING SEASON ON A 1,600-HA AREA.

THUS, THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP RESTORATION AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT FACILITATE AND ACCELERATE FAUNAL RECOLONISATION. THIS REQUIRES IDENTIFICATION OF HABITAT FEATURES THAT ACT AS FILTERS TO SLOW OR PREVENT RECOLONISATION AND WHETHER THOSE FILTERS ARE TEMPORALLY UNIDIRECTIONAL OR DYNAMIC. 2. WE INVESTIGATED SUCCESSIONAL PATTERNS OF REPTILES AND MAMMALS IN RESTORED MINE-PITS IN SOUTH-WESTERN AUSTRALIA TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL FILTERS TO FAUNAL RECOLONISATION. WE SAMPLED REPTILES AND SMALL MAMMALS USING 30 TRAPPING GRIDS ACROSS EACH OF FOUR RESTORATION AGES (4, 8, 12 AND 17-YEARS OLD) AND UNMINED FOREST AND ASSESSED VEGETATION STRUCTURE TO IDENTIFY ANIMALHABITAT RELATIONSHIPS. 3.

SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR STUDY ADDS TO GROWING EVIDENCE THAT FILTERS TO FAUNAL RECOLONISATION MAY BE WIDESPREAD IN RESTORED AREAS, WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR RESTORATION PRACTICES. FIRSTLY, EXAMINING INDIVIDUAL SPECIES MAY MORE EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY FILTERS THAN EXAMINING COMMUNITY SUCCESSIONAL PATTERNS. SECONDLY, FILTERS CAN PERSIST OVER LONG TIME FRAMES, POSSIBLY CENTURIES, SO MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS THE PROVISION AND ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT OF CWD, MAY NEED TO OCCUR OVER SIMILAR TIME FRAMES. LASTLY, FILTERS CAN BE DYNAMIC AND REPEATED MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS THINNING, MAY BE REQUIRED TO OVERCOME THESE FILTERS. THE GROWING EVIDENCE FOR FILTERS SUGGESTS THAT FACILITATING FAUNAL RECOLONISATION IS MORE COMPLEX THAN SIMPLY RETURNING VEGETATION TO RESTORATION SITES.",2

RELOCATED INDIVIDUALS BEHAVED MORE LIKE PRAIRIE DOGS ON PUBLIC LANDS THAN ANIMALS IN THE URBAN SOURCE POPULATION, BUT BEHAVIORS WERE STILL DIFFERENT FROM PRAIRIE DOGS ON PUBLIC LANDS. WE RECOMMEND RELOCATING LARGE, ADULT UTAH PRAIRIE DOGS RATHER THAN JUVENILES OR RELOCATING JUVENILES LATER IN THE TRAPPING SEASON TO INCREASE RELOCATION SUCCESS RATE.

WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT GENERAL SURVEYS TRADITIONALLY USED FOR MONITORING WRC BY SMALL MAMMALS MAY BE BIASED BECAUSE THE DEGRADED HABITATS ALONG ROADS ARE MAINLY USED BY GENERALIST AND NOT SPECIALIST SPECIES. FOR THIS REASON, WE COMPARED THE RESULTS OF A GENERAL SMALL-MAMMAL SURVEY WITH THOSE FROM A SPECIES-SPECIFIC ONE, FOCUSING ON 3 STUDY SPECIES: 1 HABITAT GENERALIST (NORTH AMERICAN DEER MOUSE [PEROMYSCUS MANICULATUS]), 1 FOREST SPECIALIST (SOUTHERN RED-BACKED VOLE [MYODES GAPPERI]), AND 1 PRAIRIE SPECIALIST (MEADOW VOLE [MICROTUS PENNSYLVANICUS]).

THE DEER MICE DID NOT SHOW PREFERENCES FOR ANY WCS TYPE, WHEREAS THE SPECIALIST SPECIES (VOLES) USED ONLY OVERPASSES. THEREFORE, GENERAL SURVEYS USED WITHOUT SPECIES IDENTIFICATION CAN UNDERESTIMATE THE VALUE OF WCS FOR SPECIALIST SMALL MAMMALS, WITH RELEVANT CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, WE RECOMMEND SPECIES-SPECIFIC SURVEYS OF WCS SUITABILITY FOR SMALL MAMMALS.

SOFT-RELEASE MEASURES, INCLUDING ACCLIMATISATION, HAVE BEEN USED FOR MANY SPECIES AROUND THE WORLD, BASED ON THE REASONING THAT GRADUAL AND SUPPORTED REINTRODUCTIONS SHOULD IMPROVE THE SUCCESS OF ANIMALS RELEASED INTO AN UNFAMILIAR WILD ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER, EXPERIMENTAL TESTING OF SOFT-RELEASE METHODS IS RARE. AIMS TO EXPERIMENTALLY TEST THE EFFECT OF A SOFT-RELEASE METHOD VERSUS A HARD-RELEASE METHOD ON THE INITIAL REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS OF THE EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOT (PERAMELES GUNNII). METHODS WE RELEASED 12 CAPTIVE-BRED EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOTS INTO A PREDATOR-PROOF RESERVE USING TWO METHODS: SOFT-RELEASE (7 DAYS OF ON-SITE ACCLIMATISATION WITH SUPPLEMENTARY FOOD BEFORE RELEASE) AND HARD-RELEASE (NO ACCLIMATISATION AND NO SUPPLEMENTARY FOOD). WE MONITORED THE BANDICOOTS INTENSIVELY VIA RADIO-TRACKING AND LIVE-TRAPPING FOR 4 WEEKS AFTER RELEASE. COMPARED WITH HARD-RELEASE BANDICOOTS, WE PREDICTED THAT SOFT-RELEASE BANDICOOTS WOULD HAVE (1) REDUCED MOVEMENT (FIRST NIGHT DISPERSAL, SITE FIDELITY AND ACTIVITY RANGE), (2) MORE DIRECTED PATTERNS OF HABITAT SELECTION, (3) IMPROVED BODYWEIGHTS AND (4) IMPROVED SURVIVAL. KEY RESULTS THERE WAS NO DETECTABLE DIFFERENCE IN HABITAT SELECTION, OVERALL WEIGHT CHANGE AND SURVIVAL BETWEEN THE SOFT-RELEASE AND HARD-RELEASE GROUPS. THERE WAS MODERATE EVIDENCE THAT, COMPARED WITH THE HARD-RELEASE GROUP, SOFT-RELEASE BANDICOOTS MOVED LESS, DEMONSTRATED LOWER INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN ALL MEASURES OF MOVEMENT, AND LOST WEIGHT MORE GRADUALLY AFTER RELEASE. IN MOST CASES, EFFECT SIZES WERE MODERATE TO LARGE BUT HAD LARGE STANDARD ERRORS OWING TO BOTH SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND HIGH VARIANCE. CONSEQUENTLY, STATISTICAL TESTING FAILED TO DETECT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AT THE 5% LEVEL. CONCLUSIONS DESPITE EVIDENCE THAT THE RELEASE METHOD INFLUENCED SOME OF THE MONITORED BEHAVIOURS, SOFT-RELEASE DID NOT CONFER A CONSISTENT AND SUBSTANTIVE ADVANTAGE FOR CAPTIVE-BRED EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOTS AT OUR SITE. WE CONCLUDE THAT SOFT-RELEASE IS UNLIKELY TO IMPROVE OVERALL REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS FOR THIS SPECIES AT FENCED PREDATOR-FREE SITES. IMPLICATIONS THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE PREFERRED OPTION FOR REINTRODUCTIONS OF EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOTS TO FENCED SITES IS A HARD-RELEASE, INFORMATION THAT IS NOW BEING USED TO GUIDE REINTRODUCTIONS OF THIS SPECIES.

WE MEASURED THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCES OF MEDIUM AND LARGE MAMMALS BEFORE AND AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GUARD PATROLS, TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF THIS MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR PROTECTING WILDLIFE. THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF THE FAUNA INCREASED BY 72.6\% AFTER THE INITIATION OF GUARD PATROLS, FROM 5.07 TO 8.68 ENCOUNTERS/10 KM, WITH PREFERRED GAME SPECIES (DASYPUS NOVEMCINCTUS, CUNICULUS PACA, PECARI TAJACU, AND MAZAMA AMERICANA) INCREASING BY 146.7-300\%. SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCES OF PREFERRED GAME SPECIES AT OUR SITE AFTER THE INITIATION OF THE GUARD PATROLS AND THOSE OF OTHER PROTECTED NEOTROPICAL RESERVES INDICATE THAT THE MICHELIN RESERVE IS NOW BEING EFFECTIVELY PROTECTED. ALTHOUGH THE COST OF \$9.4/HA TO PROTECT THE RESERVE IS HIGH, THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THE PRIVATE RESERVE INITIATIVE CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE COMPONENT OF THE NATIONAL CONSERVATION STRATEGY.",1

ACCORDINGLY, THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO INVESTIGATE IF IN VITRO MATURED AND ENUCLEATED OOCYTES OF DOMESTIC SHEEP COULD BE USED FOR INTERSPECIES CONSERVATION CLONING OF ESFAHAN MOUFLON (OVIS ORIENTALIS ISPHAHANICA), A VULNERABLE SPECIES CLASSIFIED BY THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE. CRYO-BANKED FIBROBLASTS OF A MOUFLON (DERIVED FROM A GENOME RESOURCE BANK) AND A DOMESTIC SHEEP (PREPARED DURING A RECENT STUDY) WERE CULTURED IN VITRO AND USED FOR KARYOTYPING. PRIOR TO SCNT, FIBROBLAST DONOR CELLS WERE SERUM STARVED FOR 5 DAYS. USING THE ZONA-FREE SCNT TECHNIQUE, IN VITRO MATURED AND ENUCLEATED DOMESTIC SHEEP OOCYTES WERE RECONSTITUTED WITH NUCLEI DONOR CELLS OF MOUFLON AND DOMESTIC SHEEP, AND THEIR COMPETENCIES FOR IN VITRO DEVELOPMENT TO THE BLASTOCYST STAGE WERE COMPARED. THE CLONED MOUFLON BLASTOCYSTS WERE THEN SURGICALLY TRANSFERRED INTO THE UTERUS OF THE SYNCHRONIZED DOMESTIC SHEEP. KARYOTYPE ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THAT FIBROBLASTS OF THE ESFAHAN MOUFLON HAD THE CORRECT NUMBER OF DIPLOID CHROMOSOMES (2N = 54). EVALUATION OF 907 ACTIVATED RECONSTRUCTS [ESFAHAN MOUFLON (N = 667), DOMESTIC SHEEP (N = 240)] REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE TERM OF BLASTOCYST DEVELOPMENT (7.6 ± 0.5% VS. 9.3 ± 0.5%, RESPECTIVELY). AFTER THE TRANSFER OF 12 CLONED ESFAHAN MOUFLON BLASTOCYSTS TO FIVE DOMESTIC SHEEP RECIPIENTS, TWO (40.0%) PREGNANCIES WERE ESTABLISHED IN WHICH BOTH (100%) WERE SUSTAINED UNTIL CAESAREAN SECTION (DAYS 147 AND 150 OF PREGNANCY, RESPECTIVELY) AND CULMINATED IN THE LIVE BIRTHS OF CLONED ESFAHAN MOUFLON LAMBS. HOWEVER, THE NEWBORNS DID NOT SURVIVE AND DIED SOON AFTER BIRTH. KARYOTYPE AND GENETIC ANALYSES CONFIRMED THAT BOTH CLONES HAD CORRECT DIPLOID CHROMOSOME NUMBER (2N = 54), AND WERE GENETICALLY IDENTICAL TO EACH OTHER IN ADDITION TO THEIR ORIGINAL CELL DONOR.

OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF PREDATOR TREATMENTS ON MOOSE POPULATION DYNAMICS BY INVESTIGATING CHANGES IN SURVIVAL WHILE EVALUATING THE CONTRIBUTION OF POTENTIALLY CONFOUNDING COVARIATES. IN MAY 2003 AND 2004, WE REDUCED BLACK BEAR (URSUS AMERICANUS) AND BROWN BEAR (U. ARCTOS) NUMBERS BY TRANSLOCATING BEARS ≥240 KM FROM THE STUDY AREA. AIRCRAFT-ASSISTED TAKE REDUCED WOLF (CANIS LUPUS) NUMBERS MARKEDLY IN THE STUDY AREA DURING 2004-2007. WE ESTIMATED BLACK BEARS WERE REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY 96% BY JUNE 2004 AND RECOVERED TO WITHIN 27% OF UNTREATED NUMBERS BY MAY 2007. BROWN BEARS WERE REDUCED APPROXIMATELY 50% BY JUNE 2004. LATE-WINTER WOLF NUMBERS WERE REDUCED BY 75% BY 2005 AND LIKELY REMAINED AT THESE LEVELS THROUGH 2007. IN ADDITION TO PREDATOR TREATMENTS, MOOSE HUNTING CLOSURES DURING 2004-2007 REDUCED HARVESTS OF MALE MOOSE BY 60% IN THE STUDY AREA. PREDATOR TREATMENTS RESULTED IN INCREASED CALF SURVIVAL RATES DURING SUMMER (PRIMARILY FROM REDUCED BLACK BEAR PREDATION) AND AUTUMN (PRIMARILY FROM REDUCED WOLF PREDATION). PREDATOR TREATMENTS HAD LITTLE INFLUENCE ON SURVIVAL OF MOOSE CALVES DURING WINTER; INSTEAD, CALF SURVIVAL WAS INFLUENCED BY SNOW DEPTH AND POSSIBLY TEMPERATURE. INCREASED SURVIVAL OF MOOSE CALVES DURING SUMMER AND AUTUMN COMBINED WITH RELATIVELY CONSTANT WINTER SURVIVAL IN MOST YEARS LED TO A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN ANNUAL SURVIVAL OF CALVES FOLLOWING PREDATOR TREATMENTS. NONPREDATION MORTALITIES OF CALVES INCREASED FOLLOWING PREDATOR TREATMENTS; HOWEVER, THIS INCREASE PROVIDED LITTLE COMPENSATION TO THE DECREASE IN PREDATION MORTALITIES RESULTING FROM TREATMENTS. THUS, PREDATOR-INDUCED CALF MORTALITY WAS PRIMARILY ADDITIVE. SUMMER SURVIVAL OF MOOSE CALVES WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO CALF MASS (Β &GT; 0.07, SE = 0.073) DURING TREATED YEARS AND LOWER (Β = -0.82, SE = 0.247) FOR TWINS THAN SINGLETONS DURING ALL YEARS. FOLLOWING PREDATOR TREATMENTS, SURVIVAL OF YEARLING MOOSE INCREASED 8.7% FOR FEMALES AND 21.4% FOR MALES DURING SUMMER AND 2.2% FOR FEMALES AND 15.6% FOR MALES DURING AUTUMN. ANNUAL SURVIVAL OF ADULT (≥2 YR OLD) FEMALE MOOSE ALSO INCREASED IN TREATED YEARS AND WAS NEGATIVELY (Β = -0.21, SE = 0.078) RELATED TO AGE. MOOSE DENSITY INCREASED 45%, FROM 0.38 MOOSE/KM2 IN 2001 TO 0.55 MOOSE/KM2 IN 2007, WHICH RESULTED FROM ANNUAL INCREASES IN OVERALL SURVIVAL OF MOOSE, NOT INCREASES IN REPRODUCTIVE RATES. INDICES OF NUTRITIONAL STATUS REMAINED CONSTANT THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY DESPITE INCREASED MOOSE DENSITY.

THIS LOW RECRUITMENT COMBINED WITH LIBERAL ANTLERLESS DEER HARVEST HAS RESULTED IN DECLINES IN SOME DEER POPULATIONS, AND CONSEQUENTLY, INCREASED INTEREST IN COYOTE POPULATION CONTROL. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER NEONATE SURVIVAL INCREASED AFTER COYOTE REMOVAL, WHETHER COYOTE PREDATION ON NEONATES WAS ADDITIVE TO OTHER MORTALITY SOURCES, AND WHETHER UNDERSTORY VEGETATION DENSITY AFFECTED NEONATE SURVIVAL. WE MONITORED NEONATE SURVIVAL FOR 4 YEARS PRIOR TO (2006-2009) AND 3 YEARS DURING (2010-2012) INTENSIVE COYOTE REMOVAL ON 3 32-KM2 UNITS ON THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S SAVANNAH RIVER SITE, SOUTH CAROLINA. WE REMOVED 474 COYOTES (1.63 COYOTES/KM2 PER UNIT PER YEAR), REDUCING COYOTE ABUNDANCE BY 78% FROM PRE-REMOVAL LEVELS. THE BEST MODEL (WI = 0.927) DESCRIBING SURVIVAL PROBABILITY AMONG 216 RADIO-COLLARED NEONATES INCLUDED A WITHIN-YEAR QUADRATIC TIME TREND VARIABLE, DATE OF BIRTH, REMOVAL TREATMENT, AND A VARYING REMOVAL YEAR EFFECT. UNDER THIS MODEL, SURVIVAL DIFFERED BETWEEN PRE-TREATMENT AND REMOVAL PERIODS AND IT DIFFERED AMONG YEARS DURING THE REMOVAL PERIOD, BEING &GT;100% GREATER THAN PRE-TREATMENT SURVIVAL (0.228) DURING THE FIRST REMOVAL YEAR (0.513), SIMILAR TO PRE-TREATMENT SURVIVAL DURING THE SECOND REMOVAL YEAR (0.202), AND INTERMEDIATE DURING THE THIRD REMOVAL YEAR (0.431). DESPITE AN INITIAL INCREASE, THE OVERALL EFFECT OF COYOTE REMOVAL ON NEONATE SURVIVAL WAS MODEST. MORTALITY RATE ATTRIBUTABLE TO COYOTE PREDATION WAS LOWEST DURING THE FIRST REMOVAL YEAR (0.357) WHEN SURVIVAL WAS GREATEST, BUT THE MORTALITY RATE FROM ALL OTHER CAUSES DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE PRE-TREATMENT PERIOD AND ANY YEAR DURING REMOVALS, INDICATING THAT COYOTE PREDATION ACTED AS AN ADDITIVE SOURCE OF MORTALITY. SURVIVAL PROBABILITY WAS NOT RELATED TO VEGETATION COVER, EITHER DIRECTLY OR IN INTERACTION WITH COYOTE ABUNDANCE. WHEN THE OBJECTIVE IS TO INCREASE THE RECRUITMENT OF WHITE-TAILED DEER, WE CONCLUDE THAT NEITHER COYOTE CONTROL NOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT APPEAR EFFECTIVE.

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO INVESTIGATE PATTERNS OF WILDLIFE POPULATIONS AND DIVERSITY BEFORE AND AFTER THE INSTALLATION OF A PERIMETER ELECTRIC FENCE. WE FIND STRONG EVIDENCE FOR LONG-TERM HUMAN-INDUCED EDGE EFFECTS AT THE SITE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE BORDER OF THE PROTECTED AREA (TREETOPS); THIS SITE REGISTERED THE STRONGEST LOSSES IN TOTAL WILDLIFE POPULATION NUMBERS, AGGREGATE WILDLIFE BIOMASS, AND SPECIES RICHNESS. IN CONTRAST, WILDLIFE POPULATIONS AT THE SITE FARTHER AWAY FROM THE EDGE OF THE PROTECTED AREA (THE ARK) HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE OVER THE DURATION OF THE DATASET. OUR DATA REVEAL CLEAR DIFFERENTIATION IN THE TEMPORAL CHANGES OF WILDLIFE POPULATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO SITES. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FENCE IN 1989 LED TO TEMPORARY INCREASES IN WILDLIFE POPULATIONS NEAR THE PARK MARGINS, BUT SINCE THE LATE 1990S THESE GAINS HAVE BEEN REVERSED AND WILDLIFE POPULATIONS HAVE CONTINUED TO DECLINE NEAR THE EDGE OF THE RESERVE. WITHOUT THE INTENTION OF UNDERMINING THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF FENCES AS CONSERVATION TOOLS, OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT FENCES ARE ONLY AS EFFECTIVE AS THE MANAGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS THAT ACCOMPANY THEM. © 2014 ELSEVIER LTD.",1

WE COLLECTED PRIMARY DATA ON 12 EUROPEAN GROUND SQUIRREL REINTRODUCTION PROJECTS CARRIED OUT AT 14 LOCALITIES IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, SLOVAKIA AND POLAND SINCE 1989. WE FOCUSED ON SEVEN METHODOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF EACH REINTRODUCTION: SELECTION OF RELEASE SITE, METHOD OF RELEASING, DATE OF RELEASING, ORIGIN OF RELEASED ANIMALS, TOTAL NUMBER OF RELEASED ANIMALS, MEAN NUMBER OF RELEASED ANIMALS PER SEASON AND REINTRODUCTION SITE MANAGEMENT. THE METHOD OF RELEASING WAS FOUND TO BE THE KEY FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE SETTLEMENT OF ANIMALS AT THE TARGET LOCALITY. ONLY SOFT RELEASING METHODS, I. E. THE USE OF ENCLOSURES AND/OR ARTIFICIAL BURROWS, ENSURE THAT ANIMALS REMAIN AT THE TARGET LOCALITY. THE OTHER FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY DETERMINING REINTRODUCTION SUCCESS ARE THE NUMBER OF RELEASED ANIMALS PER SEASON (AT LEAST 23 ANIMALS REQUIRED) AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF RELEASED ANIMALS (A MINIMUM OF 60 INDIVIDUALS). LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT OF THE SITE AND REGULAR MONITORING OF THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED POPULATION ARE NECESSARY.

WE ESTIMATED SURVIVAL, RECRUITMENT AND REALIZED POPULATION GROWTH RATES FROM FOUR CAPTURE-MARK-RECAPTURE STUDIES TO DETERMINE IF THE PATTERN OF DEMOGRAPHIC VARIATION WAS CONSISTENT WITH PREDATION AS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF KLWR DECLINES. ADDITIONALLY, WE EVALUATED THE KLWR CAPTIVE-BREEDING AND RELEASE PROGRAM BY COMPARING SURVIVAL OF CAPTIVE-BORN AND RELEASED KLWRS TO WILD-BORN KLWRS. THE REALIZED POPULATION GROWTH RATE OF WILD-BORN KLWRS HAD A STRONG PATTERN OF COVARIATION WITH RECRUITMENT; COVARIATION BETWEEN THE REALIZED POPULATION GROWTH RATE AND APPARENT SURVIVAL WAS NEGLIGIBLE. CONSISTENT WITH DEMOGRAPHIC THEORY, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT KLWR POPULATION DYNAMICS WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY VARIATION IN RECRUITMENT, AND THAT PERIODIC REDUCTIONS IN RECRUITMENT LED TO POPULATION DECLINES. WE FOUND THAT THE SURVIVAL CURVE AND THE FIRST MONTH (S1) AND FIRST 3-MONTH (S1-3) SURVIVAL ESTIMATES FOR THE WILD-BORN KLWRS [S1 = 0.929 (0.890-0.968); S1-3 = 0.942 (0.919-0.965)] WERE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER (Χ2 = 33.9, 1 D.F., P < 0.001) THAN RELEASED KLWRS [S1 = 0.521 (0.442-0.600); S1-3 = 0.561 (0.493-0.629)].

WE LIVE-TRAPPED MICE, VOLES AND SHREWS IN SPRING AND AUTUMN IN 2 YEARS (FOUR SAMPLING PERIODS) AT TWO SITES IN SIX HABITAT TYPES: CROPLANDS, GRASSLANDS RESTORED 3-6 YEARS EARLIER AND NATURAL GRASSLANDS. DATA ON 421 INDIVIDUALS OF 12 SPECIES SHOWED THAT RESTORED GRASSLANDS WERE SIMILAR TO CROPLANDS AND NATURAL GRASSLANDS IN SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE AND COMPOSITION. AT THE LOCAL SCALE, MANAGEMENT INFLUENCED ABUNDANCE BECAUSE THERE WERE MORE SMALL MAMMALS IN UNMANAGED AND EARLY-MOWN GRASSLANDS WITH TALLER VEGETATION THAN IN LATE-MOWN OR GRAZED GRASSLANDS WITH LOWER VEGETATION, OR IN PLOUGHED CROPLANDS. ELEVATION WAS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE SITES AT HIGHER ELEVATION PROVIDED REFUGES DURING SPRING FLOODS OR SUMMER DROUGHTS. AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE, THE PROPORTION OF RESTORED AND NATURAL GRASSLANDS POSITIVELY AFFECTED THE ABUNDANCE OF SMALL MAMMALS, WHEREAS THE PROPORTION OF LINEAR HABITATS (ROADS, CANALS) HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON ABUNDANCE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT MANAGEMENT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN RESTORATION PER SE AT THE LOCAL SCALE, WHICH IS EXPECTED FOR HABITAT GENERALISTS SUCH AS SMALL MAMMALS IN CONTRAST TO SPECIALISTS SUCH AS PLANT-FEEDING INVERTEBRATES. HOWEVER, RESTORATION PROVIDES LANDSCAPE-SCALE BENEFITS BY INCREASING THE AREA OF GRASSLANDS THAT CAN SERVE AS REFUGES FOR SMALL MAMMALS IN UNFAVOURABLE PERIODS.

WE ASSESSED THE GENETIC DIVERSITY OF ANIMALS TRANSLOCATED TO EACH SITE AND THEIR WILD-BORN PROGENY, AND WHETHER WILD-BORN ANIMALS SHOWED EVIDENCE OF GENETIC BOTTLENECKS OR GENETIC DRIFT FROM THE SOURCE POPULATION. ENCOURAGINGLY, WE FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY IN ANY OF THE WILD-BORN POPULATIONS COMPARED TO THE SOURCE POPULATION AND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INBREEDING OR RELATEDNESS AMONGST WILD-BORN INDIVIDUALS COMPARED TO FOUNDER POPULATIONS TWO YEARS POST-TRANSLOCATION. HOWEVER, WE DETECTED AN APPROXIMATELY 10-FOLD REDUCTION IN EFFECTIVE POPULATION SIZE BETWEEN FOUNDING AND WILD-BORN POPULATIONS. WE FOUND NO APPARENT DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN WILD-BORN POPULATIONS AND THE ORIGINAL SOURCE POPULATION, OR BETWEEN WILD-BORN ANIMALS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE FOUNDERS. POPULATION VIABILITY MODELING PREDICTS THAT EACH OF THE TRANSLOCATED POPULATIONS IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOSS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY OVER TIME.

THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENT RABBIT HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE VIRUS (RHDV) WAS INTRODUCED TO AUSTRALIA IN 1995 AND RESULTED IN DRAMATIC, WIDESPREAD RABBIT SUPPRESSION. WE COMPARED THE AREA OF OCCUPANCY AND EXTENT OF OCCURRENCE OF 4 EXTANT SPECIES OF SMALL MAMMALS BEFORE AND AFTER RHDV OUTBREAK, RELATIVE TO RAINFALL, SAMPLING EFFORT, AND RABBIT AND PREDATOR POPULATIONS. DESPITE LOW RAINFALL DURING THE FIRST 14 YEARS AFTER RHDV, 2 NATIVE RODENTS LISTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE (IUCN), THE DUSKY HOPPING-MOUSE (NOTOMYS FUSCUS) AND PLAINS MOUSE (PSEUDOMYS AUSTRALIS), INCREASED THEIR EXTENT OF OCCURRENCE BY 241-365\%. A THREATENED MARSUPIAL MICROPREDATOR, THE CREST-TAILED MULGARA (DASYCERCUS CRISTICAUDA), UNDERWENT A 70-FOLD INCREASE IN EXTENT OF OCCURRENCE AND A 20-FOLD INCREASE IN AREA OF OCCUPANCY.

ALTHOUGH TRAPPING HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO ATTEMPT TO CONTROL MINK, MANAGERS HAVE LITTLE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF ITS EFFECT ON MINK DENSITY OR DISTRIBUTION, PARTICULARLY WHERE IMMIGRATION OF MINK FROM NEARBY AREAS IS INEVITABLE. SUCH EVIDENCE IS NEEDED TO JUSTIFY THE USE OF LETHAL METHODS IN CONSERVATION POLICY. DURING 2006-2010 WE REMOVED MINK FROM THE RIVER MONNOW CATCHMENT IN WESTERN BRITAIN, USING TRACK-RECORDING RAFTS TO MONITOR CONTINUOUSLY FOR MINK PRESENCE, GUIDING A STRATEGIC TRAPPING EFFORT. THE AREA MONITORED AND TRAPPED WAS INCREASED IN STAGES, FROM A CORE SUB-CATCHMENT WITH 109 KM OF WATER-COURSE IN 2006, TO A 421-KM2 CATCHMENT WITH 203 KM OF WATER-COURSE IN 2009. IN EACH SUCCESSIVE SUB-CATCHMENT, MINK DETECTION AND CAPTURE RATES DECLINED RAPIDLY TO NEAR-ZERO LEVELS AFTER TRAPPING BEGAN. DETECTIONS AND CAPTURES SHOWED SEASONAL PEAKS IN EVERY YEAR CORRESPONDING TO KNOWN DISPERSAL PERIODS, BUT ALSO DECLINED STEADILY FROM YEAR TO YEAR, WITH INCREASING PERIODS IN WHICH WE DID NOT DETECT MINK. THESE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT EACH SUB-CATCHMENT WAS CLEARED OF MINK WITHIN A FEW MONTHS, WITH SUBSEQUENT CAPTURES ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMMIGRATION. ON AVERAGE, WE DETECTED EACH MINK 5.1 TIMES BEFORE CAPTURE (DAILY PROBABILITY OF DETECTION = 0.059 PER MINK AND RAFT), AND TRAPPED THEM 3.4 DAYS AFTER DEPLOYING TRAPS IN RESPONSE.

WE ALSO COMPARED THE POST-RELEASE DIET OF THESE DEVILS WITH THE DIET OF WILD DEVILS ON MAINLAND TASMANIA, WHERE A SIMILAR ARRAY OF DIET ITEMS IS AVAILABLE. METHODS TWENTY-EIGHT CAPTIVE-RAISED DEVILS WERE RELEASED ONTO THE ISLAND; 19 HAD BEEN RAISED IN INTENSIVE CAPTIVE-MANAGEMENT FACILITIES (IC) AND NINE IN FREE-RANGE (22 HA) ENCLOSURES (FRE). SURVIVAL AND BODY-MASS CHANGE WERE COMPARED BETWEEN IC AND FRE FOR UP TO 440 DAYS POST-RELEASE. DEVIL DIET WAS ASSESSED VIA SCAT ANALYSIS. KEY RESULTS A HIGH PROPORTION (96%) OF THE FOUNDERS SURVIVED 1 YEAR POST-RELEASE. PRE-RELEASE CAPTIVE-REARING METHOD HAD NO EFFECT. RELEASED DEVILS GAINED AN AVERAGE OF 14% OF THEIR ORIGINAL BODY MASS, IRRESPECTIVE OF CAPTIVE-REARING METHOD. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE DIET OF CAPTIVE-REARED DEVILS RELEASED ONTO MARIA ISLAND RELATIVE TO WILD MAINLAND DEVILS: TASMANIAN PADEMELON, THYLOGALE BILLARDIERII, WAS THE PRIMARY FOOD ITEM FOR BOTH. CONCLUSIONS THE INTENSITY OF CAPTIVE REARING DID NOT AFFECT THE SURVIVAL OF DEVILS RELEASED ONTO MARIA ISLAND. THIS SUGGESTS THAT EVEN DEVILS HELD IN IC FACILITIES RETAIN THE INNATE BEHAVIOUR REQUIRED TO SCAVENGE AND HUNT PREY, AND THEREFORE MAINTAIN BODYWEIGHT POST-RELEASE. THE LACK OF ANY THREATENING PROCESSES ON THE ISLAND IS ALSO LIKELY TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE HIGH SURVIVAL RATE 2 YEARS POST-RELEASE.

PASSAGE RATES OF DEER APPROACHING UNDERPASSES STEADILY INCREASED FROM 54% IN YEAR 1 TO 92% IN YEAR 3. PEAK MOVEMENTS DURING THE AUTUMN MIGRATION OCCURRED IN MID-DECEMBER, WHILE PEAK SPRING MOVEMENTS WERE IN MID-MARCH AND EARLY MAY. UNDERPASS AND FENCE INSTALLATION EFFECTIVELY REDUCED DVCS BY 81%. HAD FENCE GATES REMAINED CLOSED AND CATTLE GUARDS CLEAR OF SNOW, DVCS COULD BE ELIMINATED ALTOGETHER. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT UNDERPASSES, COMBINED WITH GAME-PROOF FENCING, CAN IMPROVE HIGHWAY SAFETY FOR MOTORISTS WHILE PROVIDING SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MOVEMENT CORRIDORS FOR LARGE POPULATIONS OF MIGRATORY MULE DEER. © 2012 THE WILDLIFE SOCIETY.",1

THE ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT OF CONTROLLING ACCESS CAN BE EFFECTIVE FOR SHORT-TERM HABITAT PROTECTION, BUT NOT FOR WILDLIFE CONSERVATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN OIL INDUSTRY PRACTICES ALTER THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF LOCAL INDIGENOUS GROUPS.",1

OPERATIONS TO RESTORE CONIFER PLANTATIONS ON ANCIENT WOODLAND SITES (PAWS) WITH NATIVE BROADLEAVES MAY BE ESPECIALLY HAZARDOUS TO DORMICE POPULATIONS, SINCE DORMOUSE DENSITIES ARE GENERALLY LOWER HERE SO SUDDEN PERTURBATIONS MAY CAUSE LOCAL EXTINCTION.

LIVESTOCK GUARDIAN DOGS (LGDS) MAY BE ABLE TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE PREDATION, BUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN AUSTRALIAN GRAZING SYSTEMS HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATED. IN PARTICULAR, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LGDS IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY RANGE FREELY OVER LARGE AREAS IN COMPANY WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF LIVESTOCK. AIMS WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LGDS AS CURRENTLY USED IN AUSTRALIA AND DETERMINE THE FACTORS INFLUENCING EFFECTIVENESS, IN PARTICULAR IN RELATION TO SCALE OF MANAGEMENT. WE ALSO DOCUMENTED HOW LGDS ARE MANAGED IN AUSTRALIA, EVALUATED THEIR COST EFFECTIVENESS, AND IDENTIFIED FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE NUMBER OF DOGS REQUIRED IN DIFFERENT PROPERTY SITUATIONS. METHODS WE CONDUCTED A TELEPHONE SURVEY OF 150 LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS WITH LGDS IN AUSTRALIA, INCLUDING ALL LIVESTOCK TYPES AND PROPERTY SITUATIONS, IN ALL STATES. TEN PRODUCERS WERE VISITED, OF WHICH ONE IS DETAILED AS A CASE STUDY. KEY RESULTS EFFECTIVENESS WAS APPARENTLY HIGH: 65.7% OF RESPONDENTS REPORTED THAT PREDATION CEASED AFTER OBTAINING LGDS, AND A FURTHER 30.2% REPORTED A DECREASE OF PREDATION. WHEN THE NUMBER OF STOCK PER DOG EXCEEDS 100, LGDS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE ALL PREDATION. DOGS ARE OFTEN KEPT FREE-RANGING ON LARGE PROPERTIES WHERE WILD DOGS ARE THE MAIN PREDATOR, BUT ARE USUALLY RESTRICTED IN THEIR MOVEMENTS ON SMALLER PROPERTIES OR WITH SMALLER PREDATORS. THE COST OF OBTAINING A LGD IS RETURNED WITHIN 1–3 YEARS AFTER THE DOG STARTS WORKING. THE NUMBER OF DOGS REQUIRED FOR A PROPERTY MAINLY DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF LIVESTOCK NEEDING PROTECTION, AND THE MAIN TYPE OF PREDATOR IN THE AREA. CONCLUSIONS PROVIDED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF LGDS ARE USED, THEY CAN BE AS EFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING LIVESTOCK FROM PREDATORS IN AUSTRALIA WHEN RANGING FREELY ON LARGE PROPERTIES WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF LIVESTOCK AS THEY ARE IN SMALL-SCALE FARMING SYSTEMS. IMPLICATIONS LGDS CAN PROVIDE A COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL PREDATOR CONTROL METHODS IN AUSTRALIA’S EXTENSIVE GRAZING ENTERPRISES, POTENTIALLY REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR OTHER FORMS OF CONTROL.

BETWEEN JANUARY AND MARCH 2008, WOODEN DRY LEDGES WERE PLACED IN 15 OF 32 SURVEYED CULVERTS. ADDITIONALLY 100. METERS OF SMALL MESH SIZE AND BURIED FENCES WERE INSTALLED ALONG EACH SIDE OF ALL CULVERTS. DURING ONE YEAR WE USED VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AND TRACK-PLATES TO DETECT CROSSING EVENTS OVER SEVEN CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS PER SEASON IN EACH MONITORED CULVERT. WE EVALUATE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DRY LEDGES ON CULVERT USE AND COMPARE THE NUMBER OF ROAD-KILLS WITHIN A 100. M BUFFER RADIUS AROUND THE CULVERTS BEFORE AND AFTER FENCE INSTALLATION AND CULVERTS THAT WERE NEVER FENCED (CONTROL CULVERTS). ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT SPECIES RESPONDED TO CULVERT FEATURES DIFFERENTLY, THE PRESENCE OF DRY LEDGES WAS THE MOST RELEVANT FEATURE EXPLAINING CROSSING EVENTS, IN PARTICULAR, FOR STONE MARTENS AND GENETS. THE FENCING USED DID NOT REDUCE MAMMALS ROAD-KILL PREVALENCE. OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE CULVERT USE, ROAD MANAGERS SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PLACEMENT OF LEDGES ON CULVERTS THAT REMAIN FLOODED MOST OF THE YEAR (MORE THAN 3. CM OF WATER-DEPTH). WE ALSO SUGGEST EXPLORING THE ROLE OF LEDGE SIZE AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING USED BY FOXES AND BADGERS. © 2013 ELSEVIER B.V.",2

HOWEVER, ITS SUCCESS IS UNCERTAIN AND INVOLVES RISKS. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO WILDLIFE MANAGERS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF TRANSLOCATION DISTANCE ON ANIMAL MOVEMENT BEHAVIOR AND SURVIVAL, WE TRANSLOCATED 40 LONG-HAIRED FIELD MICE (ABROTHRIX LONGIPILIS) AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FROM THEIR TERRITORIES (0-1,300 M) IN CENTRAL CHILE AND RECORDED THE LOCATION AND SURVIVAL OF EACH MOUSE OVER 3 DAYS. TRANSLOCATED ANIMALS SHOWED LOW RELEASE SITE FIDELITY AND TRAVELED TWO- TO FOUR-FOLD LONGER DISTANCES THAN THE NONTRANSLOCATED GROUP. ONLY MICE TRANSLOCATED AT SHORTER DISTANCES (100 M) ORIENTED THEIR MOVEMENT TOWARD THEIR ORIGIN SITE AND HAD A HIGH PROBABILITY OF HOMING (80 %). THERE WERE THRESHOLD DISTANCES FROM AFTER WHICH HOMING AND TRAVELING STRONGLY DECREASED. ALL INDIVIDUALS RELEASED CLOSE TO THEIR CAPTURE SITE (≤100 M) REMAINED ALIVE, WHILE MORTALITY REACHED 22 % AT LONGER TRANSLOCATION DISTANCES, PRINCIPALLY AS A RESULT OF FIGHTING BETWEEN RODENTS. THEREFORE, LONG TRANSLOCATION DISTANCES PREVENTED SHORT-TERM HOMING AND DECREASED TRAVELED DISTANCES (A DESIRABLE OUTCOME), BUT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CONSPECIFIC ENCOUNTERS NEED TO BE AVOIDED. BECAUSE MICE SHOWED A HIGH MOTIVATION TO EXPLORE SURROUNDINGS, IT IS ADVISABLE TO RELEASE ANIMALS IN SITES WITH ALTERNATIVE PLACES TO COLONIZE.

WE TESTED THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT RELEASE CONDITIONS ON SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION OF CAPTIVE BRED COMMON HAMSTERS (CRICETUS CRICETUS L. 1758), A HIGHLY ENDANGERED SPECIES IN WESTERN EUROPE. AS PREDATION PLAYS A DETERMINANT ROLE FOR RELEASED HAMSTERS, ESPECIALLY DURING THE FIRST DAYS AFTER RESTOCKING, WE PERFORMED TWO RELEASE EXPERIMENTS INTENDING TO REDUCE MORTALITY: WE TESTED (1) THE EFFICIENCY OF TERRESTRIAL PREDATOR PROOF ELECTRIC FENCES AND (2) THE IMPACT OF IMPROVED SHELTER AVAILABILITY. WE ASSESSED BOTH SURVIVAL RATE AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS BY RADIOTRACKING 70. HAMSTERS BETWEEN RELEASE DATE AND THE END OF THEIR ABOVEGROUND ACTIVE PERIOD. REDUCING CONTACT BETWEEN RELEASED ANIMALS AND PREDATORS THANKS TO ELECTRIC FENCES HAD A STRONG POSITIVE IMPACT ON HAMSTERS' SURVIVAL AND ALLOWED THEM TO HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO REPRODUCE. IT ALSO APPEARED THAT RELEASE OF HAMSTERS WAS MORE EFFICIENT IN WHEAT CROP THAN IN ALFALFA. AS EXPECTED, WHEAT HARVEST, INDUCING A SUDDEN LACK OF SHELTER, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED RESTOCKING SUCCESS. FINALLY, LIFETIME AFTER RELEASE AFFECTED THE NUMBER OF LITTERS PER FEMALE AND VARIED WITH INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS: IT DECREASED WITH BURROW CHANGE FREQUENCY AND WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER FOR MALES.

AMONG SOME REMNANT POPULATIONS, COTTONTAILS OCCUPY SMALL PATCHES OF THICKET HABITAT WHERE THEY EXPERIENCE HIGH MORTALITY RATES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF LIMITED FOOD DURING WINTER. THIS LIMITATION CAUSES RABBITS TO FORAGE AWAY FROM COVER WHERE THEY ARE EXPOSED TO PREDATORS. ALTHOUGH CONSERVATION EFFORTS ARE EMERGING TO REVERSE THE DECLINE OF NEW ENGLAND COTTONTAILS, MOST ARE DIRECTED TOWARD IMPROVING LONG-TERM VIABILITY BY INCREASING THE ABUNDANCE OF SUITABLE HABITATS. SUCH EFFORTS DO LITTLE TO IMPROVE THE SHORT-TERM SURVIVAL OF REMAINING COTTONTAILS. TO ADDRESS THIS IMMEDIATE NEED, WE EVALUATED THE USE OF SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD AS AN APPROACH TO IMPROVE OVER-WINTER SURVIVAL RATES. WE SPECULATED THAT BY POSITIONING FEEDERS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ESCAPE COVER, RABBITS WOULD BE LESS VULNERABLE TO PREDATORS. WE EVALUATED THIS APPROACH USING EASTERN COTTONTAILS (SYLVILAGUS FLORIDANUS) AS A RESEARCH SURROGATE BECAUSE THIS SPECIES IS READILY AVAILABLE AND HAS SIMILAR HABITAT REQUIREMENTS TO NEW ENGLAND COTTONTAILS. TRANSMITTER-EQUIPPED EASTERN COTTONTAILS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER A FED OR UNFED GROUP. REMOTELY-TRIGGERED CAMERAS WERE ALSO USED TO GAUGE USE OF FEEDERS BY COTTONTAILS AND VISITS BY OTHER SPECIES. WINTER SURVIVAL RATES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FOR FED RABBITS (70\%) THAN FOR UNFED RABBITS (32\%). CAMERAS REVEALED THAT RABBITS WERE THE MOST FREQUENT CONSUMER AND THAT THERE WAS ONLY LIMITED CARNIVORE ACTIVITY NEAR FEEDERS.

SPECIFICALLY, WE EXAMINED THE HOME RANGE AND HABITAT USE OF WOYLIES REINTRODUCED INTO A SANCTUARY FREE FROM INVASIVE PREDATORS AND COMPARED THESE DATA TO THOSE FROM AN EXTERNAL REFERENCE SITE. EIGHT WOYLIES INSIDE THE SANCTUARY AND SEVEN OUTSIDE WERE RADIO-TRACKED IN AUTUMN 2011. THE AVERAGE HOME-RANGE SIZE WAS 65.4 (±8.2, S.E.) HA. THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST ANY DIFFERENCE IN HOME-RANGE SIZE BETWEEN WOYLIES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE SANCTUARY. WOYLIES WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE FOUND IN THE SLOPE AND LOW-LYING VALLEY HABITATS, WHICH HAVE GREATER WATER-HOLDING CAPACITY AND SANDIER SOILS. THESE RELATIVELY LARGE SEASONAL HOME RANGES, COMPARED WITH PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED ESTIMATES FOR THE SPECIES, MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY LOW POPULATION DENSITY, LOWER SEASONAL FOOD AVAILABILITY AND CLUSTERED FOOD DISTRIBUTION.

AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE RESULTING LOSS OF HABITAT HETEROGENEITY, NUMEROUS SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH TRADITIONAL FARMLAND HAVE UNDERGONE SEVERE POPULATION DECLINES. TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE ON FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY, AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES (AES) HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SINCE THE EARLY 1990S. THE EFFECTS OF AES HAVE BEEN EVALUATED FOR DIFFERENT TAXA, BUT RARELY FOR LARGER MAMMALS LIKE THE BROWN HARE (LEPUS EUROPAEUS), A CHARACTERISTIC SPECIES OF TRADITIONAL OPEN FARMLAND. USING SPOTLIGHT COUNTS FROM 58 BROWN HARE MONITORING STUDY SITES OVER 17 YEARS, WE ANALYSED THE EFFECTS OF LAND-USE AND SEVERAL AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME OPTIONS ON BROWN HARE DENSITY IN THE SWISS LOWLAND. WE USED OPEN-POPULATION BINOMIAL MIXTURE MODELS TO JOINTLY MODEL ABUNDANCE AND DETECTION PROBABILITY, THEREBY ACCOUNTING FOR IMPERFECT DETECTION OF HARES. MEAN OBSERVED COUNTS OF BROWN HARES IN SWITZERLAND FROM 1992 TO 2008 SUGGESTED A SLIGHT DECLINE FOLLOWED BY A RECOVERY IN ARABLE STUDY SITES, WHEREAS A SUSTAINED DECLINE WAS APPARENT IN GRASSLAND SITES. MEAN DETECTION PROBABILITY RANGED WIDELY FROM YEAR TO YEAR (ARABLE: 0.33-0.70: GRASSLAND: 0.21-0.80). WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR IMPERFECT DETECTION, A POPULATION RECOVERY WAS APPARENT IN BOTH LAND-USE TYPES, ALTHOUGH HARE DENSITIES REMAINED AT LOW LEVELS COMPARED TO OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE AMOUNT OF EXTENSIVELY MANAGED HAY MEADOWS SEEMED TO HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON BROWN HARE ABUNDANCE BOTH IN ARABLE AND GRASSLAND SITES. HEDGEROWS WERE ALSO POSITIVELY RELATED TO HARE DENSITY, ALTHOUGH ONLY IN ARABLE STUDY SITES. THE AMOUNT OF SET-ASIDES/WILDFLOWER STRIPS AND BROWN HARE DENSITY WERE RELATED NEITHER IN ARABLE NOR IN GRASSLAND SITES. THIS RESULT WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE FAIRLY LOW PERCENTAGES OF THIS AES OPTION IN OUR STUDY SITES. HABITAT IMPROVEMENTS BY MEANS OF AES INDICATE SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS ON BROWN HARE POPULATIONS IN SWITZERLAND, BUT THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF AES MUST STILL BE INCREASED. COMBINED WITH A BINOMIAL MIXTURE MODEL CORRECTING FOR IMPERFECT DETECTION, SPOTLIGHT COUNTS ARE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR ESTIMATING POPULATION TRENDS, ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM SURVEYS LIKE THE SWISS BROWN HARE MONITORING.

USING THE CASE OF REINTRODUCED EUROPEAN BISON (BISON BONASUS L.) IN THE NORTHERN CARPATHIANS, WE SHOW HOW HABITAT SUITABILITY MODELS IN COMBINATION WITH CONNECTIVITY ASSESSMENTS BASED ON CIRCUIT THEORY CAN REMEDY SUCH SHORTCOMINGS, AND IDENTIFY POTENTIAL HABITAT PATCHES AND CORRIDORS BETWEEN THESE. EUROPEAN BISON WERE REINTRODUCED IN OUR STUDY AREA IN THE 1960S, AND AGAINST PRIOR EXPECTATION, HAVE NOT SPREAD ALONG THE CARPATHIAN RIDGE, BUT INSTEAD EXPANDED THEIR RANGE TOWARDS HUMAN SETTLEMENTS. OUR ANALYSES PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS PATTERN. ALTHOUGH WE IDENTIFIED A NETWORK OF SUITABLE HABITAT PATCHES ALONG THE CARPATHIAN RIDGE, THE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM WERE LIMITED DUE TO A NUMBER OF MAJOR BARRIERS TO MOVEMENT. TO AVOID FUTURE CONFLICTS BETWEEN EUROPEAN BISON AND PEOPLE, AND TO ACHIEVE THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF A VIABLE BISON METAPOPULATION IN THIS REGION, CONSERVATION ACTION SHOULD FOCUS ON ESTABLISHING CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN HABITAT PATCHES THROUGH THE CREATION AND LEGAL PROTECTION OF CORRIDORS AND WILDLIFE PASSAGES, WHICH WOULD BENEFIT CARPATHIAN WILDLIFE IN GENERAL.

WE QUANTIFIED OCCUPANCY AND COLONIZATION PROBABILITY OF OLD GROWTH, REGROWTH AND PLANTED WOODLAND PATCHES BY ARBOREAL MARSUPIALS WITHIN AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES SUBJECT TO WOODLAND RESTORATION OVER AN 11-YEAR PERIOD. OUR ANALYSES FOCUSED ON THE COMMON BRUSHTAIL POSSUM TRICHOSURUS VULPECULA AND COMMON RINGTAIL POSSUM PSEUDOCHEIRUS PEREGRINUS. WE FOUND STRONG EVIDENCE OF A GRADIENT IN OCCUPANCY LEVELS RANGING FROM HIGHEST IN OLD GROWTH WOODLAND, APPROACHING ZERO IN PLANTINGS, WITH REGROWTH WOODLAND INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THESE TWO BROAD TYPES OF VEGETATION STRUCTURE. PLANTINGS WERE NOT OCCUPIED BY EITHER SPECIES AT THE OUTSET OF OUR INVESTIGATION AND WERE RARELY COLONIZED THROUGHOUT THE SUBSEQUENT 10YEARS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT A LACK OF SHELTER SITES IN LARGE OLD HOLLOW-BEARING TREES IS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS LIMITING THE OCCURRENCE OF PLANTINGS BY CAVITY-DEPENDENT ARBOREAL MARSUPIALS, SUGGESTING A LAG BETWEEN PLANTING ESTABLISHMENT AND THE TIME REQUIRED FOR PLANTINGS TO BECOME SUITABLE HABITAT. WE FOUND THE PROBABILITY OF COLONIZATION WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF VEGETATION COVER IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. UNEXPECTEDLY, COLONIZATION PROBABILITY WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY A TEMPORAL INCREASE IN WOODY VEGETATION COVER SURROUNDING A PATCH. A PAUCITY OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PATCH COLONIZATION AND THE TEMPORAL CHANGE IN VEGETATION COVER MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE INCREASED VEGETATION COVER IN OUR STUDY LANDSCAPES OVER THE PAST DECADE HAS RESULTED FROM ESTABLISHMENT OF PLANTINGS WHICH ARE GENERALLY NOT SUITABLE NESTING HABITAT FOR ARBOREAL MARSUPIALS. OUR FINDINGS HAVE KEY MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS SUCH AS EMPHASIZING THE VALUE OF OLD GROWTH WOODLAND FOR ARBOREAL MARSUPIALS AND OF TARGETING RESTORATION EFFORTS AROUND OLD GROWTH AND REGROWTH WOODLAND PATCHES, AND THE FLAWED NOTION OF BIODIVERSITY OFFSETS THAT ALLOW REPLANTINGS TO COMPENSATE FOR CLEARING OLD GROWTH WOODLAND.",1

TYPICALLY, THE SUCCESS OF A TRANSLOCATION PROGRAM IS MEASURED AT THE POPULATION SOURCE, WITH LITTLE ATTENTION GIVEN TO THE FATE OF TRANSLOCATED INDIVIDUALS. HERE WE USE A KOALA (PHASCOLARCTOS CINEREUS) TRANSLOCATION PROGRAM FROM SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA AS A CASE STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF TRANSLOCATION ON INDIVIDUAL ANIMALS. THE KOALA IS AN ICONIC SPECIES THAT OCCURS AT HIGH DENSITIES IN SOME PARTS OF ITS SOUTHERN RANGE, LEADING TO NUMEROUS CONSERVATION AND ANIMAL WELFARE ISSUES. BETWEEN 1997 AND 2007 OVER 3,000 KOALAS FROM A HIGH-DENSITY ISLAND POPULATION WERE CAPTURED, SURGICALLY STERILIZED, AND TRANSLOCATED TO THE MAINLAND. ANNUAL POST-TRANSLOCATION SURVEYS AT RELEASE SITES REVEALED DENSITIES OF Â&0.4 KOALAS/HA, DESPITE RELEASE DENSITIES OF 1.0 KOALA/HA. RADIOTRACKING STUDIES INDICATE THAT LOW DENSITIES WERE BECAUSE OF BOTH MORTALITY AND HIGH DISPERSAL OF TRANSLOCATED INDIVIDUALS. WE OBSERVED A MORTALITY RATE OF 37.5% FOR TRANSLOCATED KOALAS IN THE FIRST 12 MONTHS POST-RELEASE. NO DEATHS OCCURRED AMONG ANIMALS THAT WERE NOT STERILIZED AND TRANSLOCATED. TRANSLOCATED KOALAS MOVED GREATER DISTANCES THAN NON-TRANSLOCATED ANIMALS. MONITORING OF TRANSLOCATED INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE PERFORMED ROUTINELY DURING TRANSLOCATION PROGRAMS FOR OVERABUNDANT SPECIES.

SEVERAL PAST STUDIES HAVE MONITORED THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL BREEDING STRUCTURES IN THE WILD, BUT VIRTUALLY NONE OF THEM HAVE INVESTIGATED WHICH DEMOGRAPHIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ACTUALLY DETERMINE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN FACILITATING REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY THOSE FACTORS INFLUENCING BREEDING SUCCESS IN ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES. WITH THIS PURPOSE WE SURVEYED A DECLINING POPULATION OF A KEYSTONE SPECIES OF MEDITERRANEAN ECOSYSTEMS, NAMELY THE EUROPEAN WILD RABBIT. IN DONANA NATIONAL PARK, WE SAMPLED DURING THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS THE BREEDING SUCCESS OF WILD RABBITS FROM 47 ARTIFICIAL WARRENS, EXPERIMENTALLY PROVIDED UNDER DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH FACTORS, WE APPLIED AN AIC MODEL SELECTION PROCEDURE TO ALTERNATIVE BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS GROUPS, POSTULATING THAT BREEDING SUCCESS IN ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES WOULD PRIMARILY DEPEND ON POPULATION DENSITY, FOOD AVAILABILITY AND/OR PREDATOR LIMITATION. WE FOUND THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF ARTIFICIAL WARRENS IN FACILITATING RABBIT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS CAN VARY, WITH AN INCREASE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER PASTURE AVAILABILITY. PREDATOR LIMITATION BY FENCING ALSO POSITIVELY AFFECTED RABBIT REPRODUCTION, BUT ONLY IN COMBINATION WITH HIGH PASTURE AVAILABILITY. ON THEIR OWN, FENCING TREATMENT AND POPULATION REINFORCEMENTS HAD LOW AND NULL EFFECTIVENESS FACILITATING REPRODUCTION, RESPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS ENTAILING SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND BIOLOGICAL COSTS. THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE BREEDING SUCCESS IN ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES, THEREFORE, WAS THROUGH THEIR STRATEGIC PLACEMENT IN POTENTIAL HIGH-QUALITY HABITATS, I.E. WITH SUITABLE PASTURE AVAILABILITY. WE SUGGEST THAT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT CAN EFFECTIVELY INCREASE CARRYING CAPACITY AND CONSEQUENTLY THE TARGET SPECIES' REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, ESPECIALLY IN FAST BREEDING SPECIES LIKE THE EUROPEAN WILD RABBIT. THE PROVISION OF ARTIFICIAL BREEDING STRUCTURES FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFIT FROM THE ELABORATION OF CONCURRENT EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES SIMILAR TO THE PRESENT RESEARCH, WHICH CAN HELP ESTABLISH USEFUL GUIDELINES FOR OPTIMIZING FUTURE CONSERVATION EFFORTS.

HABITAT SELECTION WAS MODELED FOR DIFFERENT AGES (JUVENILES AND ADULTS), ACTIVITY (RESTING OR ACTIVE), AND SEASONS (SUMMER, TRANSITION, AND WINTER) AND WAS VALIDATED WITH INDIVIDUALS PREVIOUSLY EXCLUDED FROM OUR ANALYSIS. ANTEATERS STRONGLY SELECTED AREAS DEDICATED TO NATURE CONSERVATION. ADULTS SHOWED HIGHER MODEL FIT. HYGROPHILOUS FOREST WAS POSITIVELY SELECTED AND OPEN SAVANNA WAS AVOIDED. ANTEATERS RESTED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN FORESTS. WHILE ACTIVE THEY INCREASED THE USE OF OTHER HABITATS, EXCEPT FOR OPEN SAVANNA. GRASSLANDS WERE MOST USED DURING THE WINTER SEASON, PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE A CONSTANT FOOD SOURCE AND BETTER COVER THAN SAVANNAS.

FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED TO CLARIFY WHETHER THIS PATTERN EMERGED BECAUSE FISHERS HAD RELAXED SIZE SELECTIVITY DURING THE CLOSURE OR DUE TO A PAUCITY OF ADULTS IN JULY. FIFTY-SEVEN PER CENT OF THE INTERVIEWED FISHERS INDICATED THAT WHILE GROUPERS WOULD BE THEIR FIRST CHOICE DURING OPEN SEASON, N.UNICORNIS WOULD BECOME THEIR PREFERRED TARGET DURING THE CLOSURE, AND THAT OTHER HERBIVORES WERE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO BE TARGETED. THIS STUDY TOOK AN IMPORTANT STEP IN IDENTIFYING A FACTOR DRIVING SHORT AND ACUTE CHANGES IN THE HERBIVORE CATCH COMPOSITION. FURTHER EFFORTS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO QUANTIFY THE ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE OBSERVED CHANGES AND DETERMINE IF THESE ARE AGGRAVATED BY THE LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS OR FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF THE FOCAL SPECIES. RELAXED SPECIES SELECTIVITY MIGHT EMERGE ELSEWHERE, IF INHERENTLY SELECTIVE FISHING METHODS ARE USED AND HIGHLY PRIZED TARGETS ARE TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY BANNED, OR OVERFISHED TO CRITICAL LEVELS. SUCH IMPLICATIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN ASSESSING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF LOCAL FISHERIES. © 2013 THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.",2

THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SPAWNING CLOSURE FOR ATLANTIC COD (GADUS MORHUA) IN THE FIRTH OF CLYDE OFF THE SCOTTISH WEST COAST (ICES AREA VIA). THIS CLOSURE WAS INTRODUCED IN MARCH 2001 AS AN EMERGENCY MEASURE TO ALLOW AS MANY COD AS POSSIBLE TO SPAWN AND AVOID THE BUILD-UP OF DISPLACED EFFORT FROM ANOTHER SPAWNING CLOSURE. GENETIC, TAGGING, AND OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY INVESTIGATIONS INDICATE THAT COD INHABITING THE CLYDE ARE REPRODUCTIVELY ISOLATED FROM OTHER RESIDENT GROUPS IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PART OF THE SCOTTISH WEST COAST STOCK. THIS STUDY USED A BEYOND-BEFORE-AFTER, CONTROL-IMPACT APPROACH TO COMPARE POPULATION TRENDS OF THE CLYDE SPAWNING AGGREGATION BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTRODUCED AREA CLOSURE, USING TWO OTHER SUB-POPULATION SPAWNING GROUNDS AS CONTROL AREAS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF LOCAL RECOVERY IN TERMS OF ABUNDANCE, BIOMASS, OR REDUCED MORTALITY IN THE CLYDE MORE THAN A DECADE AFTER ESTABLISHING THE CLOSURE. MORTALITY MAY HAVE REMAINED HIGH BECAUSE YOUNG COD ARE STILL CAUGHT AS BYCATCH IN THE NEPHROPS FISHERY IN THE AREA AND THE PREDATION RATE MAY HAVE INCREASED DUE TO AN EXPANDING WHITING POPULATION. CONSIDERING THE STATE OF THE ALREADY SEVERELY DEPLETED CLYDE SUB-POPULATION WHEN THE CLOSURE WAS IMPLEMENTED THE MEASURE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN TOO LITTLE AND TOO LATE. THE TENDENCY TO IMPLEMENT SUCH SPAWNING CLOSURES ON NEARLY COLLAPSED STOCKS MAY BE WHY THESE MEASURES OFTEN APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE.",2

CONSEQUENTLY, RESERVES AS CURRENTLY POSITIONED PROTECT ONLY A SUBSET OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS PRESENT FOR FISH WITHIN THE REGION, AND POTENTIALLY SUPPORT RESIDUAL ESTUARINE HABITATS (I.E.

MARINE RESERVES CAN REGULATE HOW HUMAN ACTIVITIES ALTER FISH COMMUNITIES AND INCREASE THE ABUNDANCE OF TARGETED SPECIES, BUT THE COMBINED INFLUENCE OF RESERVES AND SEASCAPE CONTEXT ON SPECIES HABITAT USE REMAINS UNCERTAIN IN MANY ECOSYSTEMS. FURTHER, MARINE RESERVE EFFECTIVENESS MIGHT BE LOW FOR MOBILE SPECIES IF THE SIZE OF THE RESERVE IS LESS THAN A SPECIES USUAL RANGE, REDUCING THE OVERALL TIME A INDIVIDUAL MAY BE PROTECTED. IN THIS STUDY, WE TRACKED 19 GIANT SHOVELNOSE RAYS (GLAUCOSTEGUS TYPUS), AN IUCN LISTED VULNERABLE SPECIES WITHIN THE MORETON BAY MARINE PARK IN EASTERN AUSTRALIA. WE USED AN ARRAY OF 28 ACOUSTIC RECEIVERS WITHIN A COMPLEX MOSAIC OF SEAGRASS PATCHES, BARE SAND, MANGROVE FORESTS AND DEEP-WATER CHANNELS AND USED REGRESSION TREE ANALYSES TO DETERMINE WHICH SPATIAL, TEMPORAL AND PROTECTION FACTORS CONTRIBUTED MOST TO G.

WE USED DATA ON FISH COMMUNITIES COLLECTED FROM 233 INDIVIDUAL SITES IN 9 WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN COUNTRIES TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN THE SITE'S FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION AND ASSOCIATED LIFE-HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS ALONG A LARGE RANGE OF FISH BIOMASS. AS BIOMASS INCREASED ALONG THIS RANGE, FISH WERE LARGER AND GREW AND MATURED MORE SLOWLY WHILE THE ABUNDANCE OF SCRAPING AND PREDATORY SPECIES INCREASED.

COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF ENTIRE FISH ASSEMBLAGES ALSO DIFFERED BETWEEN THESE LEVELS OF MODIFICATION AND ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT FISHERIES SPECIES CONTRIBUTED MOST TO THIS DIFFERENCE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT WHILE HIGHLY PROTECTED SANCTUARY ZONES MAY INCREASE THE ABUNDANCE OF TARGETED FISH COMPARED WITH LESS PROTECTED AREAS WITHIN THE SAME ESTUARY, HIGHLY INDUSTRIALIZED OR URBANIZED SYSTEMS, NOT TYPICALLY CHOSEN AS MARINE PARKS, MAY ACTUALLY SUPPORT MORE TARGETED SPECIES OF FISH.

COMPLIANCE OF THE PATAGONIAN MPA WAS ASSESSED BY ANALYSING EIGHT YEARS OF SATELLITE VESSEL MONITORING SYSTEM (VMS; 2000–2008) DATA, WHICH SHOWED COMPLIANCE AND FISHING EFFORT CONCENTRATED NEAR THE PROTECTION BOUNDARIES. MPA EFFECTS WERE STUDIED BY EMPLOYING A FIVE YEAR DATABASE COLLECTED BY A SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH VESSEL IN PROTECTED AND FISHING LOCATIONS, BEFORE AND AFTER THE MPA ESTABLISHMENT. WE ASSESSED 152 SCIENTIFIC TRAWLING STATIONS USING MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF FISH ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE, FISH ABUNDANCE (DISCRIMINATING TARGET AND NON-TARGET SPECIES), AND MEAN SIZE AND PROPORTION OF JUVENILES OF THE TARGET SPECIES (ARGENTINE HAKE, MERLUCCIUS HUBBSI). THE IDENTIFIED MPA EFFECTS WERE A TREND TOWARDS INCREASING ABUNDANCE OF THE DEMERSAL FISH ASSEMBLAGE, THE TARGET AND NON-TARGET FISH SPECIES, AND HAKE JUVENILE SIZE, AND A HIGHER PROPORTION OF JUVENILES AGED 2+ INSIDE THE MPA.

DEPLETION IN FISH LENGTHS AND TROPHIC STRUCTURE WERE FOUND AT OR ABOVE 46 FISHING TRIPS DAY-1KM-2, SUGGESTING THAT FISHING PRESSURE IS A KEY FACTOR DRIVING FISHERY CATCH STRUCTURE.

TO DO SO, WE APPLIED NOVEL MULTI-EVENT MODELS TO A 9-YEAR DATA SET CONTAINING BOTH LIVE RECAPTURES AND DEAD RECOVERIES OF MARKED FISH OF DIFFERENT SIZES COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN MPA, ALSO INCLUDING SEVERAL UNPROTECTED SITES. AT THE MPA SITE, THE ANNUAL PROPORTION OF DEATHS DUE TO FISHING DECREASED FROM 0·59 BEFORE MPA IMPLEMENTATION TO 0·32 AFTER MPA IMPLEMENTATION. AS A RESULT, ANNUAL SURVIVAL INCREASED BY 167% (FROM 0·09 TO 0·24) FOR SMALL (16-44 CM) AND 83% (FROM 0·23 TO 0·42) FOR BIG (45-97 CM) COD, RESPECTIVELY. AVERAGE SURVIVAL WAS LOWER IN UNPROTECTED AREAS, AND ANNUAL FISHING MORTALITY WAS HIGHER, REPRESENTING ALMOST 100% OF THE TOTAL MORTALITY OF LARGE-SIZED COD IN SOME YEARS. ANNUAL EMIGRATION RATES (I.E. SPILLOVER FROM THE MPA) INCREASED IN THE LAST YEARS OF THE STUDY, BUT NO DIFFERENCES IN BODY GROWTH WERE DETECTED BETWEEN SITES. CLOSURE OF THE FISHERY WITHIN THE MPA WOULD FURTHER INCREASE THE ANNUAL SURVIVAL OF SMALLER INDIVIDUALS BY 100% (FROM 0·24 ± 0·07 TO 0·48 ± 0·11) AND THAT OF LARGER INDIVIDUALS BY 44% (FROM 0·42 ± 0·05 TO 0·60 ± 0·09).

TO EVALUATE THE DEGREE OF PROTECTION MPAS MAY PROVIDE FOR SHARKS, WE USED AN ARRAY OF ACOUSTIC RECEIVERS TO EXAMINE THE MOVEMENTS AND SPATIAL USE OF TWO TROPICAL COASTAL SPECIES WITHIN TWO MPAS IN THE GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK, AUSTRALIA. JUVENILE PIGEYE (CARCHARHINUS AMBOINENSIS) AND ADULT SPOT-TAIL (CARCHARHINUS SORRAH) SHARKS WERE FITTED WITH ACOUSTIC TRANSMITTERS FROM 2009 TO 2010. BOTH SPECIES DISPLAYED LONG-TERM USE OF MPAS, WITH SOME INDIVIDUALS DETECTED FOR LONGER THAN 600 DAYS. THE MEAN PERCENTAGE OF TIME C. AMBOINENSIS AND C.

THE INCIDENTAL FISHING MORTALITY OF SPECIES WITH LOW REPRODUCTIVE RATES, SUCH AS ELASMOBRANCHS (SHARKS, SKATES, AND RAYS), IS RECOGNIZED AS A KEY THREAT FOR THEIR POPULATIONS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, GEAR MODIFICATIONS RELATED TO THE TYPE OF HOOK AND POSITION OF THE HOOK IN THE WATER COLUMN WERE TESTED TO EXAMINE THEIR EFFECTS ON CATCH RATES AND MORTALITY OF ELASMOBRANCH SPECIES IN BOTH PELAGIC AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS. COMPARISONS BETWEEN CIRCLE (SIZE 18/0, 0° OFFSET) AND J-STYLE (SIZE 9/0, 10° OFFSET) HOOKS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE CIRCLE HOOKS HAVE A GREATER EFFICIENCY IN REDUCING THE MORTALITY OF MOST SPECIES CAUGHT, BOTH IN PELAGIC AND COASTAL LONGLINE FISHERIES. INTERNAL LODGING OF THE HOOK WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FREQUENT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS CAUGHT WITH CIRCLE HOOKS, WHICH LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR HIGHER SURVIVAL RATE AT HAULBACK. ADDITIONALLY, CIRCLE HOOKS ALSO INCREASED THE CPUE OF ELASMOBRANCHS CAUGHT IN THE PELAGIC LONGLINE FISHERY, WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT FOR CARCHARHINUS FALCIFORMIS AND PRIONACE GLAUCA. THE POSITION OF THE HOOK IN THE WATER COLUMN EXHIBITED A STRONG INFLUENCE ON THE SPECIES CAUGHT IN THE COASTAL BOTTOM LONGLINE FISHERY. SUSPENDING HOOKS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WATER COLUMN REDUCED THE BYCATCH OF COMMON DEMERSAL SPECIES, SUCH AS CARCHARHINUS ACRONOTUS, GINGLYMOSTOMA CIRRATUM, AND DASYATIS AMERICANA, WHILE INCREASING THE CPUE OF POTENTIALLY AGGRESSIVE SPECIES, SUCH AS GALEOCERDO CUVIER AND CARCHARHINUS LEUCAS. THE INTERACTION OF THE TYPE OF HOOK UTILIZED WITH ITS POSITION IN THE WATER COLUMN APPEARS TO BE AN ESSENTIAL FACTOR IN THE OPTIMIZATION OF LONGLINE SELECTIVITY AND MINIMIZATION OF BYCATCH MORTALITY. © 2011 ELSEVIER B.V.",2

SEVEN OF THE NINE TAGS REPORTED DATA, AND FOUR OF THOSE RAYS DIED WITHIN 2–4 DAYS OF RELEASE. ALL FOUR RAYS THAT DIED HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOARD ENTANGLED IN THE BUNT. THE THREE SURVIVING RAYS WERE ALL BRAILED ABOARD WITH THE TUNA CATCH. ONE SURVIVING RAY REMAINED NEAR NEW ZEALAND FOR 2.7 MONTHS DURING SUMMER, AND THE OTHER TWO MIGRATED 1400–1800 KM NORTHWARD TO TROPICAL WATERS NEAR VANUATU AND FIJI AT MINIMUM SPEEDS OF 47 AND 63 KM DAY−1 AT THE END OF SUMMER. ARCHIVE DATA FROM ONE RAY SHOWED THAT IT MADE REGULAR VERTICAL MOVEMENTS OF 25–100 M AMPLITUDE, BUT SPENT MOST OF ITS TIME SHALLOWER THAN 50 M, MORE SO DURING THE NIGHT (89.6%) THAN THE DAY (76.6%), AND MAINLY EXPERIENCED TEMPERATURES OF 18−22 °C. DIVES DEEPER THAN 200 M WERE USUALLY MADE DURING THE DAY OR TWILIGHT. ALL THREE SURVIVING RAYS TYPICALLY MOVED BETWEEN THE SURFACE AND 200–300 M DAILY, AND REACHED GREATEST DEPTHS OF 649 M, 1000 M AND 1112 M, RESPECTIVELY, SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDING THE PREVIOUS DEPTH RECORD FOR THIS SPECIES OF 445 M. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR REDUCING PURSE SEINE MORTALITY OF MOBULID RAYS BY AVOIDING AREAS OF HIGH RAY ABUNDANCE, AVOIDING SETTING ON RAY-ASSOCIATED TUNA SCHOOLS, AND ADOPTING BEST-PRACTICE METHODS OF RETURNING RAYS TO THE SEA FROM THE NET OR VESSEL.

WHALE SHARKS ARE OCCASIONALLY ENCIRCLED IN TROPICAL TUNA PURSE-SEINE NETS, THROUGHOUT THIS GLOBAL FISHERY. ALTHOUGH APPARENT IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL RATES FOLLOWING ENCIRCLEMENT AND RELEASE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ASSESSED THROUGH SCIENTIFIC ONBOARD OBSERVER PROGRAMMES, A MORE RIGOROUS METHODOLOGY IS STILL REQUIRED FOR STUDYING POST-RELEASED SURVIVAL. 3. THIS WORK PROVIDES A METHOD FOR APPLYING POP-UP SATELLITE TAGS AND REPORTS AN ENHANCED RELEASE PROCEDURE FOR WHALE SHARKS. THE FIRST ASSESSMENT OF SURVIVAL AFTER RELEASE FROM PURSE-SEINE NETS INVOLVED SIX WHALE SHARKS TAGGED BETWEEN MAY AND SEPTEMBER 2014 IN THE EASTERN TROPICAL ATLANTIC OCEAN. FIVE TAGS TRANSMITTED DATA: THREE POPPED UP AS PROGRAMMED (AFTER 30 DAYS), WHILE TWO SURFACED PREMATURELY (ONE AFTER 21 AND THE OTHER AFTER 71 DAYS (PROGRAMMED TO POP OFF AFTER 30 AND 90 DAYS, RESPECTIVELY)) BUT SHOWED NO SIGN OF UNUSUAL BEHAVIOUR. 4. OVERALL, WHALE SHARKS SURVIVED AT LEAST 21 DAYS (ONE AT LEAST 71 DAYS) AFTER RELEASE FROM PURSE-SEINE NETS. THESE OBSERVATIONS BASED ON FIVE LARGE INDIVIDUALS (TOTAL LENGTH > 8 M), SUGGEST THAT WHALE SHARKS HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF SURVIVAL WHEN RELEASED WITH THE PROPOSED METHOD. 5. ADDITIONAL TAGGING IN THIS AND OTHER OCEANS, ESPECIALLY OF JUVENILES WHICH MAY BE MORE SENSITIVE TO ENCIRCLEMENT AND RELEASE OPERATIONS, IS ESSENTIAL TO FURTHER ASSESS WHALE SHARK POST-RELEASE SURVIVAL RATES IN TUNA PURSE-SEINE FISHERIES.

IN ADDITION, A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF LARGE, MORE VALUABLE SQUID WAS CAUGHT IN THE 65. MM CODEND.

IN PARTICULAR, WE WANTED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER A T90 CODEND CAN BE A SIMPLE WAY TO IMPROVE SIZE SELECTIVITY IN THE MULTI-SPECIES MEDITERRANEAN DEMERSAL TRAWL FISHERIES. DATA WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED FOR THREE SPECIES, WHILE CONSIDERING THE CODEND DESIGN PARAMETERS MESH SIZE (M) AND NETTING DIRECTION (T0 OR T90) AS POTENTIAL FIXED EFFECTS FOR SIZE SELECTION PARAMETERS 50% RETENTION LENGTH (L50) AND SELECTION RANGE (SR). A SPECIAL MODEL WAS CONSTRUCTED AND MODEL CHOICE WAS PERFORMED SEPARATELY FOR RED MULLET (MULLUS BARBATUS), COMMON PANDORA (PAGELLUS ERYTHRINUS) AND ANNULAR SEA BREAM (DIPLODUS ANNULARIS) BASED ON THE AIC VALUE (AKAIKE, 1974) WHILE CONSIDERING EVERY POSSIBLE SIMPLER SUB-MODEL FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURE DESCRIBED IN WIENBECK ET AL. (2011). L50 AND SR PREDICTIONS WERE MADE BASED ON THIS MODEL FOR T0 AND T90 CODENDS WITH MESH SIZES FROM 38. MM TO 52. MM FOR EACH SPECIES SEPARATELY. THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT T90 CODENDS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE SIZE SELECTIVITY OF RED MULLET AND COMMON PANDORA COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL T0 CODENDS OF THE SAME MESH SIZE. HOWEVER, L50 AND SR VALUES FOR T0 AND T90 CODENDS WERE FOUND TO BE SIMILAR FOR ANNULAR SEA BREAM. THIS DIFFERENCE IN CODEND SIZE SELECTIVITY BETWEEN SPECIES WITH REGARD TO TURNING CODEND NETTING ORIENTATION BY 90° MAY BE RELATED TO THE DIFFERENCE IN BODY SHAPE. RED MULLET AND COMMON PANDORA HAVE ROUNDED SHAPES WHILE ANNULAR SEA BREAM HAS A LATERALLY COMPRESSED BODY SHAPE. INCREASE IN MESH SIZE WAS FOUND TO INCREASE L50 FOR ALL THREE SPECIES FOR BOTH CODEND TYPES. © 2013 ELSEVIER B.V.",2

GEAR-BASED MANAGEMENT OPTIONS CAN BEST BE EXPLORED USING MODELS THAT PREDICT SIZE SELECTION ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF VARIABLES RELATED TO GEAR DESIGN. SUCH A MODEL IS DEVELOPED FOR HADDOCK (MELANOGRAMMUS AEGLEFINUS) THROUGH A META-ANALYSIS OF 21 TRIALS OF CODEND SELECTION AND 19 TRIALS OF THE COMBINED SELECTION OF THE CODEND AND A SQUARE MESH PANEL. INDIVIDUAL-HAUL ESTIMATES OF THE 50% RETENTION LENGTH (L50) AND THE SELECTION RANGE (SR) ARE RELATED TO A SET OF EXPLANATORY VARIABLES THROUGH A STRUCTURAL MODEL THAT DESCRIBES THE DUAL PROCESS OF PANEL AND CODEND SELECTION. CODEND L50 AND SR ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO CODEND MESH SIZE AND NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE CODEND TWINE DIAMETER. CODEND L50 IS ALSO NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF OPEN MESHES AROUND THE CODEND CIRCUMFERENCE. PANEL L50 INCREASES WITH PANEL MESH SIZE. THE PANEL CONTRIBUTES MORE TO GEAR SELECTION AS IT IS MOVED CLOSER TO THE CODLINE. THE PANEL IS MOST EFFECTIVE BETWEEN NOVEMBER AND JANUARY AND LEAST BETWEEN MAY AND JULY, PERIODS WHICH BROADLY COINCIDE WITH PEAK AND POOR HADDOCK CONDITION. THE RESULTS ARE ILLUSTRATED FOR A TYPICAL TRAWLER TARGETING HADDOCK IN THE SCOTTISH WHITEFISH SECTOR, AND THE UTILITY OF THE MODEL FOR GEAR DESIGN AND LEGISLATION IS DISCUSSED.",3

SIGNIFICANT DECLINING TRENDS IN RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IN THIS FISHERY WERE OBSERVED FOR TUNAS, SHARKS AND BILLFISH. A DECLINE IN SEABIRD STANDARDIZED CATCH RATE OCCURRED CONCURRENTLY WITH THE UPTAKE OF SEABIRD BYCATCH MITIGATION TECHNOLOGY. CHANGED SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF FISHING EFFORT AND INCREASED USE OF WIDER CIRCLE HOOKS LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO A DECLINING SEA TURTLE STANDARDIZED CATCH RATE. TUNA AND BILLFISH MEAN LENGTHS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED OVER THE TIME SERIES DUE TO ENTIRE DISTRIBUTIONS OF LENGTH CLASSES HAVING SHIFTED TOWARDS LARGER FISH. LARGER TUNAS COMPRISED A LARGER PROPORTION OF THE CATCH DUE TO FEWER SMALL TUNAS BEING CAUGHT, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT BECAUSE MEAN LENGTHS OF LARGER SIZE CLASSES INCREASED. CONVERSELY, BILLFISH LARGEST LENGTH CLASSES EXPERIENCED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN AVERAGE LENGTHS. CHANGES IN SPATIAL AND SEASONAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF FISHING EFFORT, INCREASED USE OF WIDER CIRCLE HOOKS, AND POSSIBLY INCREASING PURSE SEINE SELECTIVE REMOVALS OF JUVENILE TUNAS, MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED SELECTIVITY FOR LARGER FISH.

IN TOTAL, 310 LONGLINE EXPERIMENTAL SETS (446 400 HOOKS) WERE DEPLOYED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2008 AND FEBRUARY 2012. THREE DIFFERENT HOOK STYLES WERE TESTED; THE TRADITIONAL J-HOOK (9/0) 10O OFFSET WAS COMPARED WITH TWO 17/0 CIRCLE HOOKS (A NON-OFFSET AND A 10O OFFSET), AND SQUID (ILLEX SPP.) BAIT WAS COMPARED WITH MACKEREL (SCOMBER SPP.). CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT (CPUE) WAS CALCULATED FOR EACH FISH SPECIES PER FISHING SET AND COMPARED BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT HOOK STYLE AND BAIT TYPE COMBINATIONS. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE EFFECTS OF HOOK STYLE AND BAIT ON THE CPUES WERE SPECIES-SPECIFIC. FOR EXAMPLE, SWORDFISH (TARGET SPECIES, XIPHIAS GLADIUS) CPUES WERE HIGHER WITH J-HOOKS BAITED WITH SQUID, WHILE FOR THE BLUE SHARK (MOST IMPORTANT BYCATCH SPECIES, PRIONACE GLAUCA) THE HIGHEST CPUES WERE OBTAINED WITH CIRCLE HOOKS BAITED WITH MACKEREL.

RESULTS WERE COMPARED FROM 65 SETS FROM SIX COMMERCIAL FISHING VESSELS TOTALLING 50 800 HOOKS IN WHICH RINGED AND NON-RINGED 16/0 CIRCLE HOOKS WITH A 10° OFFSET WERE ALTERNATED ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE LONGLINE. IN TOTAL, 464 INDIVIDUALS WERE CAUGHT IN THE 4 YEARS OF EXPERIMENT, WITH SWORDFISH (XIPHIAS GLADIUS) COMPRISING 83% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ANIMALS CAPTURED. CATCH RATES OF TARGETED SWORDFISH WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON RINGED HOOKS (CPUERINGED HOOKS = 8.465, CPUENON-RINGED HOOKS = 6.654). RESULTS INDICATE THAT RINGED CIRCLE HOOKS CAPTURED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SMALL-SIZED SWORDFISH THAN NON-RINGED CIRCLE HOOKS (27.7% VS. 19.5%, RESPECTIVELY). FOR SPECIES WITH SUFFICIENT SAMPLE SIZES, THE ODDS RATIO (OR) OF A CAPTURE WAS IN FAVOUR OF RINGED HOOKS; SIGNIFICANTLY FOR SWORDFISH (OR = 1.27 95%CI 1.04–1.57), AND NOT SIGNIFICANTLY FOR BLUEFIN TUNA (THUNNUS THYNNUS) (OR = 1.50, 95%CI 0.68–3.42) NOR FOR PELAGIC STINGRAY (PTEROPLATYTRIGON VIOLACEA) (OR = 1.13, 95%CI 0.54–2.36).

WE THEREFORE COMPARED THE CATCH RATES OF FLOATED POTS WITH ONE AND TWO ENTRANCES, AND PREDICTED THAT THE NEW DESIGN WITH ONLY ONE ENTRANCE WOULD ACHIEVE HIGHER CATCH RATES DUE TO A LOWER RATE OF ESCAPE.

THE CATCH RATE OF COD ABOVE MINIMUM LANDING SIZE (≥44 CM) OF POTS WITH ONE ENTRANCE WAS 82% HIGHER THAN THAT OF POTS WITH TWO ENTRANCES. POTS THAT WERE SNAGGED AND DID NOT FLOAT PROPERLY CAUGHT LARGE NUMBERS OF KING CRAB. THE LARGER CATCHES OF POTS WITH ONE ENTRANCE COULD BE EXPLAINED BY LOWER ESCAPE RATE FROM THIS DESIGN.

THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE T90 CODEND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SIZE SELECTIVITY FOR THE TWO ROUNDFISH SPECIES INVESTIGATED, WHITING (MERLANGIUS MERLANGUS) AND POUTING (TRISOPTERUS LUSCUS), AND SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED SIZE SELECTIVITY OF THE THREE FLATFISH SPECIES, SOLE (SOLEA SOLEA), PLAICE (PLEURONECTES PLATESSA), AND DAB (LIMANDA LIMANDA). SELECTION RANGE (SR) VALUES WERE SIMILAR FOR BOTH ROUNDFISH SPECIES WITH EACH CODEND, BUT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FOR ALL FLATFISH SPECIES BY THE T90 CODEND. MODELS THAT CONSIDERED CONTACT PROBABILITY PROVIDED THE BEST MODEL FOR FOUR OF THE SPECIES WITH T90 (POUTING, SOLE, PLAICE, AND DAB), AND ONE SPECIES WITH T0 (SOLE). LACK OF ADEQUATE CONTACT WITH THE T90 MESHES COULD BE A RESULT OF THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF INCREASED FLOW THROUGH THE T90 CODEND DUE TO T90 MESHES REMAINING MORE OPEN THAN T0 MESHES DURING TOWING, AND THE RELATIVE HIGH TOWING SPEEDS OF BEAM TRAWLS. THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT ALTHOUGH A T90 CODEND REDUCES THE SIZE SELECTIVITY OF FLATFISH, THE LOWER SR OF THE T90 CODEND COULD BE PAIRED WITH A LARGER T90 CODEND MESH SIZE FOR IMPROVED FLATFISH SELECTIVITY, AND THAT A T90 MESH CODEND INCREASES THE SIZE SELECTIVITY FOR COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED ROUNDFISH IN THE BELGIAN BEAM TRAWL FISHERY.",1

MORTALITY BY TRAWLING IS MAINLY DUE TO ENFORCED APNOEA DURING TOWING ACTIVITY.

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TEDS WAS INVESTIGATED UNDER COMMERCIAL FISHING CONDITIONS IN DIVERSE TRAWLING GROUNDS IN THE ADRIATIC SEA (MEDITERRANEAN). ALL TEDS WERE EASY TO OPERATE AND DID NOT REQUIRE CHANGES TO NORMAL FISHING OPERATIONS. DUE TO LACK OF ENTRY OF TURTLES IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO EVALUATE THE ABILITY OF THE DIFFERENT TEDS TO RELEASE TURTLES, BUT ONE LARGE LOGGERHEAD TURTLE (C.

TRADITIONALLY THE FLEXIGRID IS MOUNTED IN A TWO-PANEL EXTENSION SECTION OF A TRAWL JUST AHEAD OF THE CODEND, BUT THIS DESIGN HAS PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS, ESPECIALLY DURING HIGH VOLUME CATCH SITUATIONS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE SIZE SELECTIVE PROPERTIES OF A NEW FOUR-PANEL SECTION DESIGN FOR THE FLEXIGRID AND COMPARE THEM TO THOSE OF THE TRADITIONAL TWO-PANEL SECTION. SPECIFICALLY, WE WANTED TO DETERMINE IF THIS NEW DESIGN WOULD INCREASE THE PROBABILITY FOR UNDERSIZED FISH TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE GRID AND SUBSEQUENTLY ESCAPE THROUGH AT LEAST ONE OF THE TWO GRIDS IN THE SECTION. WE QUANTIFIED THE PARAMETER “GRID CONTACT” FOR BOTH GRIDS INDEPENDENTLY AND COMBINED FOR BOTH THE MANDATORY TWO-PANEL AND THE NEW FOUR-PANEL DESIGNS. WE DIRECTLY COMPARED THE TWO DESIGNS USING A SINGLE TRAWL WITH A THREE COMPARTMENT EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WHICH ENABLED ESTIMATION OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH OF THE GRIDS TO THE COMBINED SELECTIVITY OF THE FLEXIGRID SECTION. THE RESULTS BASED ON 51 HAULS WITH 108,518 COD AND HADDOCK LENGTH MEASUREMENTS INDICATE THAT THE FOUR-PANEL FLEXIGRID DESIGN WAS BETTER ABLE TO RELEASE UNDERSIZED FISH THAN THE TWO-PANEL DESIGN. WHILE THE MEAN VALUES OF “GRID CONTACT” ESTIMATED FOR BOTH GRID DESIGNS WERE SIMILAR, THE FOUR-PANEL SECTION HAD LOWER RISK OF CLOGGING IN SITUATIONS OF HIGH FISH ENTRY RATES. UNDERWATER VIDEO RECORDINGS REVEALED THAT THE CAUSE FOR THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DESIGNS MAY BE RELATED TO THE DIFFERENCE IN SHAPE OF THE TWO SECTIONS WHILE FISHING. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT UNDERSIZED COD ESCAPE MOSTLY THROUGH THE LOWER GRID OF THE FLEXIGRID SECTION, WHEREAS HADDOCK GENERALLY UTILIZE THE UPPER GRID. THIS FINDING IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED FOR THESE TWO SPECIES. DUE TO THE FAVOURABLE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THIS STUDY, THE FOUR-PANEL FLEXIGRID SECTION IS NOW LEGALIZED IN THE NORTHEAST ARCTIC COD AND HADDOCK FISHERY.",1

HABITAT FRAGMENTATION AFFECTS BATS DURING THEIR DAILY MOVEMENTS BETWEEN ROOSTS AND FORAGING AREAS. AS BATS ARE PROTECTED IN EUROPE, DEVELOPERS MUST IMPLEMENT SPECIFIC MITIGATION MEASURES THAT ARE HIERARCHICALLY STRUCTURED TO ACHIEVE A NULL NET IMPACT. HOWEVER, VERY FEW SPECIFIC MITIGATION MEASURES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN SPECIFICALLY FOR BATS. BAT OVERPASSES (E.G.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OVERPASSES IN FACILITATING SAFE ROAD CROSSING OF BATS IS CRITICAL FOR JUSTIFYING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS MITIGATION MEASURE. WE THEREFORE ASSESSED WHETHER BAT OVERPASSES ARE EFFECTIVELY USED BY BATS. WE STUDIED THREE BAT OVERPASSES WITH DIFFERENT DESIGNS IN FRANCE.

WE USED SIX PAIRS OF STEREO ACOUSTIC RECORDERS IN DIFFERENT HABITAT TYPES THAT WERE LOCATED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD, AND OPERATED SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. RECORDING DATA CONTAINED 57,941 BAT PASSES AND 284 BAT CROSSINGS FROM SIX SPECIES OF BATS AT THE THREE STUDY SITES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CROSSINGS ARE MORE NUMEROUS IF AN OVERPASS IS LOCATED WHERE BAT COMMUTING ROUTES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT. HOWEVER, WE FOUND THAT THE PROPORTION OF BAT CROSSINGS ALONG THE COMMUTING ROUTE WAS THE SAME WITH OR WITHOUT AN OVERPASS; THUS HIGHLIGHTING THAT BAT OVERPASSES DO NOT FULLY RESTORE HABITAT CONNECTIVITY.

FREQUENT LOW-INTENSITY BURNING (EVERY 2 OR 4 YEARS PLUS UNBURNT) AND LOGGING (WITH 33% RETENTION OF THE ORIGINAL UNLOGGED TREE BASAL AREA) WERE MANIPULATED TO ASSESS THEIR EFFECTS ON BATS. WE FOUND THAT BOTH THE FIRE REGIME AND REGROWTH AFTER LOGGING INFLUENCED THE LOCAL BAT COMMUNITY. THE ROUTINE BURNING TREATMENT (BURNT EVERY 4 YEARS) IN UNLOGGED FOREST WAS CONSISTENTLY RELATED TO HIGHER TOTAL BAT ACTIVITY (2–3 TIMES) AND SPECIES RICHNESS WHEN COMPARED TO UNBURNT CONTROLS AND LOGGING TREATMENTS. FORAGING ACTIVITY WAS MORE VARIABLE, BUT IT WAS TYPICALLY LOWEST IN UNLOGGED UNBURNT CONTROLS. THESE PATTERNS WERE EVIDENT AT BOTH THE DETECTOR SITE SCALE AND THE BLOCK SCALE AND WERE PROBABLY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN UNDERSTOREY STEM DENSITY WITH BURNING, ESPECIALLY IN UNLOGGED FOREST. BAT ACTIVITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER ACROSS THE ENTIRE STUDY AREA (INCLUDING CONTROLS) IN 1 YEAR, WHEN SAMPLING OCCURRED WITHIN 6 MONTHS OF BURNING. WHEN POOLED ACROSS BURNING TREATMENTS, UNLOGGED FOREST SUPPORTED HIGHER BAT ACTIVITY (1.5 TIMES) AND SPECIES RICHNESS THAN LOGGED FOREST (12- TO 17-YEAR-OLD REGROWTH), AGAIN MOST LIKELY BECAUSE OF A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH HIGH STEM DENSITY IN REGROWTH AFTER LOGGING.

THE METHOD ENCOURAGES FISH TO APPROACH THE NETTING BY GENERATING AN ACTIVE SHAKING MOTION USING A CAP-LIKE CANVAS AT THE END OF THE CODEND. THREE TYPES OF MODEL CODEND WERE USED: A TRADITIONAL CODEND, A FLUTTERING FLAG-LIKE NETTING PANEL AND A DOUBLE CONICAL ROPE ARRAY USED AS AN ACTIVE STIMULATING DEVICE (ASD). THE ESCAPE RESPONSES OF JUVENILE BASTARD HALIBUT (PARALICHTHYS OLIVACEUS) AND JUVENILE RED SEABREAM (PAGRUS MAJOR) WERE OBSERVED IN A CIRCULATING WATER CHANNEL. THE AMPLITUDE RATIO OF THE SHAKING DISTANCE WAS 0.6-0.8 OF THE CODEND DIAMETER AND ITS PERIOD WAS 3-4. S. THE ESCAPE RATE WAS 22-30% HIGHER IN THE SHAKING CODENDS THAN IN STEADY CODENDS. THE RELATIVE LATERAL MOVING SPEEDS OF THE ESCAPING FISH WERE 1.4-1.7 TIMES HIGHER WHEN SHAKING OCCURRED THAN WHEN NO SHAKING OCCURRED. THE SIEVING EFFECT OF THE SHAKING CODEND OPERATED TO ACTIVELY DRIVE FISH TO THE NETTING PANELS AND WEAKENED THE OPTOMOTOR RESPONSE OF FISH, POSSIBLY BY GENERATING ERRATIC MOVEMENT, ALLOWING MORE FISH TO ESCAPE, AND RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF THE JUVENILE BY-CATCH.",1

FADS FISHERIES ARE USUALLY EXPLOITED USING PURSE SEINE NETS. IN SICILIAN SEAS, TWO DIFFERENT PURSE SEINES ARE USED: (A) CLASSIC PURSE SEINE AND (B) A TRANSFORMED BEACH SEINE KNOWN AS RAUSTINA. IN THIS STUDY WE COMPARED THESE TWO FISHING GEARS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE BEST ONE FOR ASSESSING FISH DIVERSITY AND TO EVALUATE THEIR IMPACT ON THE SPECIES CAUGHT. WE SAMPLED THE FISHES ASSOCIATED WITH FADS FROM JULY TO NOVEMBER 2003. EACH HAUL WAS MONITORED BY A SCUBA DIVER WHO OBSERVED THE SPECIES ESCAPING FROM THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF NET. RESULTS SHOWED THAT BOTH GEARS CATCH THE SAME FISH SPECIES BUT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN ABUNDANCE WERE DETECTED BETWEEN GEARS. IN PARTICULAR, THE PURSE SEINE CAUGHT A HIGHER NUMBER OF THUNNUS THYNNUS THAN THE BEACH SEINE (RESPECTIVELY: 8.2 ± 1.1 VS 0.9 ± 0.2), WHICH IN TURN PROVED MORE EFFICIENT IN CATCHING C. CRYSOS (31.4 ± 3.7 VS 8.9 ± 1.5 CAUGHT BY PURSE SEINE). SCUBA OBSERVATIONS REVEALED THAT T. THYNNUS ESCAPES CAPTURE MORE EASILY FROM THE BEACH SEINE THAN FROM THE PURSE SEINE, DUE TO THEIR BEHAVIOUR OF SWIMMING AT A DEPTH BENEATH THAT REACHED BY THE BEACH SEINE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SMALLEST SPECIMENS OF C. CRYSOS PASS MORE EASILY THROUGH PURSE SEINE MESH, WHICH IS LARGER THAN BEACH SEINE MESH. BOTH GEARS ARE EQUALLY USEFUL FOR ASSESSING BIODIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH FADS, ALTHOUGH THEY GIVE DIFFERENT RESULTS FOR FISH ABUNDANCE. AS THE CATCHES OF FADS FISHERY TARGET SPECIES (I.E.

IN PERU, WHERE CETACEAN SPECIES ARE STILL IN JEOPARDY, WHALE-WATCHING MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN PROMOTING THE PROTECTION OF THESE SPECIES. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF WHALE-WATCHING TOURISTS' KNOWLEDGE REGARDING CETACEAN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION STATUS AND TO EVALUATE IF WHALE-WATCHING TOURS COULD SERVE AS PLATFORMS FOR EDUCATING THE PUBLIC AND RAISING CONSERVATION AWARENESS. THE RESULTS OF 196 CLOSED-ENDED QUESTIONNAIRES AND 20 OPEN-ENDED INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED BEFORE AND AFTER WHALE-WATCHING TOURS, DURING THE HUMPBACK WHALE SEASON (WINTER–SPRING 2014) IN NORTHERN PERU, REVEALED AN OVERALL LACK OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE PRESENCE OF SPECIES OF CETACEANS IN PERUVIAN WATERS AND THREATS TO MARINE BIODIVERSITY. HOWEVER, AFTER THE WHALE-WATCHING EXCURSION, PARTICIPANTS SAID THEY WOULD BE MORE WILLING TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR WITH RESPECT TO CETACEAN CONSERVATION AND MARINE ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT WHALE-WATCHING PLATFORMS, WHEN IMPLEMENTED WITH ADEQUATE INTERPRETERS, CAN SERVE AS A SOURCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND CAN RAISE CONSERVATION AWARENESS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONSERVATION STRATEGY TO CONSIDER IN COUNTRIES, SUCH AS PERU, WHERE BY-CATCH AND DIRECT HUNTING ARE DECIMATING LOCAL CETACEAN POPULATIONS.

IN THE WRECK FISHERY THE TOTAL EFFORT WAS 1052 NETS WITH ACTIVE PINGERS, 1056 NETS WITH DUMMY PINGERS AND 74 NETS WITHOUT PINGERS. EIGHT PORPOISES WERE CAUGHT, ALL IN NETS WITH DUMMY PINGERS. IN THE FLAT BOTTOM/STONY GROUND FISHERY THE TOTAL EFFORT WAS 5596 NETS WITH ACTIVE PINGERS, 5210 NETS WITH DUMMY PINGERS AND 2973 NETS WITHOUT PINGERS. SIXTEEN PORPOISES WERE CAUGHT, INCLUDING 1 ANIMAL IN A NET WITH ACTIVE PINGERS, 6 IN NETS WITH DUMMY PINGERS AND 9 IN NETS WITHOUT PINGERS. THE DIFFERENCE IN BYCATCH BETWEEN NETS WITH ACTIVE PINGERS AND NETS WITH INACTIVE OR NO PINGERS WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT (P<. 0.007) FOR BOTH THE WRECK FISHERY AND THE FLAT BOTTOM/STONY GROUND FISHERY. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF THE PINGER SIGNALS ON THE PORPOISES CAUSED THE REDUCTION IN BYCATCH, WHICH MEANS THAT THE RESULTS CAN BE GENERALIZED TO OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE HARBOUR PORPOISES ARE TAKEN IN GILLNETS. GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELLING DEMONSTRATED THAT COD CPUE WAS NOT AFFECTED NEGATIVELY BY PINGERS. IT WAS FURTHERMORE ESTIMATED THAT THE STONY GROUND FISHERY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER (P<. 0.001) CPUE VALUES (A FACTOR 0.47) COMPARED TO THE WRECK FISHERY.

COMPARISONS WERE ALSO MADE BETWEEN HEALTHY AND BORDERLINE RELEASE CANDIDATES. SATELLITE TAGS TRANSMITTED FOR A MEAN OF 21.2 D (SD = 19.2, RANGE = 1-79), DAILY DISTANCE TRAVELED WAS 42.0 KM/D (11.25, 20.96-70.72), AND SWIM SPEED WAS 4.3 KM/H (1.1, 2.15-8.54). POSTRELEASE PARAMETERS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN HEALTH STATUS GROUPS, HOWEVER, SS/SR DOLPHINS TRANSMITTED FOR A SHORTER MEAN DURATION THAN MS/MR AND MS/SR GROUPS. POSTRELEASE VESSEL-BASED SURVEYS CONFIRMED CONSPECIFIC GROUP LOCATION FOR TWO HEALTHY, MS/SR DOLPHINS. OVERALL, THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL TO RELEASE HEALTHY STRANDED SINGLE DELPHINIDS; HOWEVER, FURTHER REFINEMENT OF HEALTH ASSESSMENT PROTOCOLS FOR THESE CHALLENGING CASES IS NEEDED.",1

SIMILARLY, SOUND EXPOSURE LED TO A 93\% REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF FISH LOST DUE TO SEAL DAMAGE AT A SHORT-TERM TEST SITE. VISUAL MONITORING OF MARINE MAMMALS AROUND THE LONG-TERM TEST SITE SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF SEAL SURFACINGS WITHIN 100 M FROM THE LOUDSPEAKERS WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY LOWER DURING SOUND EXPOSURE. HARBOUR PORPOISE AND OTTER DISTRIBUTION AROUND THE FARM WAS NOT AFFECTED BY SOUND EXPOSURE.

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THIS SMART CURTAILMENT APPROACH (REFERRED TO AS&#XA0;TURBINE INTEGRATED MORTALITY REDUCTION, TIMR) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FATALITY ESTIMATES FOR&#XA0;TREATMENT TURBINES RELATIVE TO CONTROL TURBINES FOR POOLED SPECIES DATA, AND FOR EACH OF FIVE&#XA0;SPECIES OBSERVED AT THE STUDY SITE: POOLED DATA (-84.5%); EASTERN RED BAT (LASIURUS BOREALIS, -82.5%); HOARY BAT (LASIURUS CINEREUS, -81.4%); SILVER-HAIRED BAT (LASIONYCTERIS NOCTIVAGANS, -90.9%); BIG BROWN BAT (EPTESICUS FUSCUS, -74.2%); AND LITTLE BROWN BAT (MYOTIS LUCIFUGUS, -91.4%). THE APPROACH REDUCED POWER GENERATION AND ESTIMATED ANNUAL REVENUE AT THE WIND ENERGY FACILITY BY&#XA0;&#X2264;&#XA0;3.2% FOR TREATMENT TURBINES RELATIVE TO CONTROL TURBINES, AND WE ESTIMATE THAT THE APPROACH WOULD HAVE REDUCED CURTAILMENT TIME BY 48% RELATIVE TO TURBINES OPERATED UNDER A STANDARD CURTAILMENT RULE USED IN NORTH AMERICA. THIS APPROACH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FATALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ALL SPECIES EVALUATED, EACH OF WHICH HAS BROAD DISTRIBUTIONS IN NORTH AMERICA AND DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL AFFINITIES, SEVERAL OF WHICH REPRESENT SPECIES MOST AFFECTED BY WIND DEVELOPMENT IN NORTH AMERICA. WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS APPROACH NEEDS TO BE VALIDATED IN OTHER AREAS EXPERIENCING RAPID WIND ENERGY DEVELOPMENT, WE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS APPROACH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE BAT FATALITIES IN OTHER ECOREGIONS AND WITH OTHER BAT SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES IN NORTH AMERICA AND BEYOND.",1

ONLY 3 OF 13 LOCAL TREE CAVITY-ROOSTING BAT SPECIES/SPECIES GROUPS USED BOXES AND OCCUPANCY WAS NOT STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH MODELED BOX AND SITE ATTRIBUTES. IN THE SECOND YEAR, WE TESTED TWO HYPOTHESES THAT MAY EXPLAIN THE RELATIVELY LOW BOX USE: (1) SOLAR EXPOSURE OF BOXES WAS INADEQUATE FOR HETEROTHERMIC BATS AND (2) AVAILABLE BOX DESIGNS WERE OF LOW SUITABILITY. RELOCATING BOXES TO INCREASE SOLAR EXPOSURE DID NOT INCREASE USE, OR ENHANCE THE TEMPERATURE PROFILES OF RELOCATED BOXES. INTRODUCTION OF A NEW BOX DESIGN LED TO 11 TIMES HIGHER USE COMPARED WITH EXISTING DESIGNS FOR NYCTOPHILUS SPP. (LONG-EARED BAT). OVERALL, OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT THE BAT BOX PROGRAM WAS INEFFECTIVE DUE TO FEW BAT SPECIES USING BOXES, INFREQUENT BOX USE BY THREE SPECIES, AND RARITY OF MATERNITY ROOSTING. THE KNOWLEDGE GAP OF SPECIES-SPECIFIC BOX DESIGNS AND ROOSTING ECOLOGY LIMITS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BOXES TO OFFSET CLEARED HOLLOW-BEARING TREES.

CROIX, US VIRGIN ISLANDS, HAS BEEN COMPREHENSIVELY STUDIED SINCE 1981. NESTING AND HATCHING DATA ARE REPORTED HERE FOR THE FIRST 30 YRS OF THE RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION PROJECT. BECAUSE OF INTENSE NEST RELOCATION AND CONSERVATION EFFORTS, THE POPULATION INITIALLY SHOWED A STEADY INCREASE IN NUMBERS, WITH THE MOST DRAMATIC RISE OCCURRING BETWEEN 1997 AND 2001. IN SPITE OF CONTINUED EFFORTS, HOWEVER, THIS RECOVERY BEGAN TO STALL IN THE DECADE FROM 2000 TO 2010. ANALYSIS OF NESTING DATA, INCLUDING SPECIFIC REPRODUCTIVE PARAMETERS SUCH AS RECRUITMENT RATE, REMIGRATION INTERVAL, AND PRODUCTIVITY (NUMBER OF NESTS LAID, HATCHING SUCCESS) DURING THIS TIME FRAME, IN CONJUNCTION WITH HISTORICAL DATA, PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE FACTORS TO THE POPULATION DYNAMICS AT SANDY POINT. ANNUAL REPRODUCTIVE DATA DEMONSTRATED THAT REGARDLESS OF OVERALL NESTING NUMBERS, ODD YEARS CONSISTENTLY EXHIBITED HIGHER NESTING NUMBERS (115.6±18.58) THAN EVEN YEARS (68.4±7.63) (P<0.01). THE AVERAGE ANNUAL REMIGRATION INTERVAL INCREASED OVER THE STUDY PERIOD WITH A RECORD HIGH OF 3.41±0.18 YRS OBSERVED IN 2008. A STEADY DECLINE IN AVERAGE NESTS LAID WAS OBSERVED (R2=0.84) BETWEEN 1992 AND 2010, WITH A RECORD LOW OF 3.60±2.16 NESTS PER TURTLE IN 2010. HATCHING SUCCESS VARIED OVER THE 30-YR PERIOD FROM A PROJECT LOW OF 40.28%±23.20% IN 2005 TO A RECORD HIGH OF 67.80%±20.31% IN 1991.

HATCHING SUCCESS DECLINED OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT, AND THE NUMBER OF HATCHLINGS PRODUCED PER TURTLE DECLINED IN THE 2000S. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO A DECREASE IN POPULATION PRODUCTIVITY AND MAY ULTIMATELY HAVE INHIBITED CONTINUED POPULATION GROWTH. OVER THE STUDY PERIOD, A STABLE PERCENTAGE OF REMIGRANTS CONTINUED TO NEST AT SANDY POINT. HOWEVER, A DECREASED NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF NEOPHYTES WAS OBSERVED, SUGGESTING EITHER A DELAYED OR A DECREASED RECRUITMENT, POSSIBLY DUE TO INCREASED AGE TO SEXUAL MATURITY, AN INCREASED MORTALITY OF EARLY LIFE STAGES, OR A CHANGE IN FOOD RESOURCES AT FORAGING GROUNDS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST A POPULATION THAT HAS SLOWED GROWTH AND THAT MAY BEGIN TO DECLINE IN THE FUTURE. FURTHER RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTAND POSSIBLE MATERNAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT ARE IMPACTING THESE REPRODUCTIVE PARAMETERS AND, ULTIMATELY, AFFECTING THE POPULATION DYNAMICS AT SPNWR.",1

UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS AND HUMAN ACTIVITIES ON TURTLE POPULATIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO IMPROVE CURRENT CONSERVATION PROGRAMS. WE ANALYZED THE ABUNDANCE OF PODOCNEMIS SEXTUBERCULATA IN THE LOWER AMAZON, WHERE A MANAGEMENT EXPERIMENT IS UNDER WAY, BY COMPARING NEIGHBORING AREAS WITH AND WITHOUT COMMUNITY-BASED MANAGEMENT (CBM) INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, WE ANALYZED THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES ON THE SPECIES' ABUNDANCE. ABUNDANCE WAS MEASURED BY CAPTURES PER UNIT EFFORT EXPRESSED IN NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS (CPUEN) AND BIOMASS (CPUEB). THE EFFECTS OF CBM AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES WERE TESTED BY GENERAL LINEAR MODEL ANALYSIS. A TOTAL OF 354 INDIVIDUALS WERE CAPTURED, 321 IN THE AREAS UNDER CBM AND 33 IN AREAS WITHOUT CBM. CPUEN AND CPUEB WERE STRONGLY CORRELATED, AND THEIR VALUES WERE ABOUT 10-FOLD HIGHER IN THE AREAS CARRYING OUT CBM INITIATIVES. THE VARIABLE THAT BEST EXPLAINED VARIATION IN CPUEN AND CPUEB WAS CBM. DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SAMPLING POINT AND THE NEAREST NESTING BEACH AND RIVER LEVEL ALSO INFLUENCED CAPTURE RATES. RESULTS CLEARLY SHOW THAT LOCAL FISHING RESTRICTIONS CAN HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON TURTLE POPULATIONS. © 2013 CHELONIAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION.",4

THERMAL REGIMES DURING EMBRYOGENESIS MIGHT THEREFORE HAVE DIRECT CONSEQUENCES ON FITNESS, POTENTIALLY EVEN SHAPING POPULATION TRAJECTORIES. THESE EFFECTS ARE LIKELY STRONGEST IN SHORT-LIVED SPECIES WHERE EVEN TEMPORARY TEMPERATURE-INDUCED DIFFERENCES IN BODY SIZE OR SHAPE MIGHT HAVE ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF INCUBATION TEMPERATURE ON THE BODY SIZE AND SHAPE OF HATCHLING AUSTRALIAN PAINTED DRAGONS (CTENOPHORUS PICTUS). EGGS INCUBATED AT LOW TEMPERATURE REQUIRED A LONGER INCUBATION PERIOD, BUT PRODUCED HATCHLINGS OF GREATER BODY MASS. HOWEVER, NO EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE WAS FOUND ON THE STRUCTURAL DIMENSIONS OF HATCHLINGS. THESE RESULTS MIGHT BE EXPLAINED BY AN INCREASED ABSORPTION OF WATER BY THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO DURING THE PROLONGED INCUBATION PERIOD. A GREATER WATER CONTENT MIGHT INCREASE EARLY-LIFE DESICCATION TOLERANCE IN THIS SHORT-LIVED LIZARD INHABITING ARID AND SEMIARID ENVIRONMENTS. EGG MASS, HOWEVER, HAD THE STRONGEST EFFECT ON HATCHLING PHENOTYPE, WITH LARGER EGGS PRODUCING LARGER HATCHLINGS. FURTHERMORE, THERE WAS A SEASONAL EFFECT ON YOLK ALLOCATION, WITH EGGS LAID EARLIER BEING LARGER THAN THOSE LAID LATER. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOLK ALLOCATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR AFFECTING HATCHLING PHENOTYPE IN THIS SPECIES, WHILE TEMPERATURE MAINLY AFFECTS EMBRYO DEVELOPMENTAL RATE AND LIKELY HAS AN INDIRECT EFFECT ON HATCHLING WATER CONTENT.",1

WE DEVELOPED A PROCESS TO ESTIMATE POPULATION SIZE USING N-MIXTURE MODELS AND SPATIAL MODELS FOR NEWLY ESTABLISHED AND DISPERSING POPULATIONS. WE USED OUR APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE POPULATION SIZE OF CRITICALLY ENDANGERED ST. CROIX GROUND LIZARDS (AMEIVA POLOPS) FIVE YEARS AFTER TRANSLOCATION OF 57 INDIVIDUALS TO BUCK ISLAND, AN OFFSHORE ISLAND OF ST. CROIX, UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS. ESTIMATES OF POPULATION SIZE INCORPORATED ABIOTIC VARIABLES, DISPERSAL LIMITS, AND OPERATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE AVAILABLE TO THE LIZARDS TO ACCOUNT FOR LOW SPECIES DETECTION. OPERATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE AND DISTANCE FROM THE TRANSLOCATION SITE WERE ALWAYS IMPORTANT IN FITTING THE N-MIXTURE MODEL INDICATING EFFECTS OF DISPERSAL AND SPECIES BIOLOGY ON ESTIMATES OF POPULATION SIZE. WE FOUND THAT THE POPULATION IS INCREASING ITS RANGE ACROSS THE ISLAND BY 5-10% EVERY SIX MONTHS. WE SPATIALLY INTERPOLATED SITE-SPECIFIC ABUNDANCE FROM THE N-MIXTURE MODEL TO THE ENTIRE ISLAND, AND WE ESTIMATED 1,473 (95% CI, 940-1,802) ST. CROIX GROUND LIZARDS ON BUCK ISLAND IN 2013 CORRESPONDING TO SURVEY RESULTS. THIS REPRESENTS A 26-FOLD INCREASE SINCE THE TRANSLOCATION.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO EXAMINE HOW TRANSLOCATION METHOD (HARD- VS. SOFT-RELEASE) AND HABITAT STRUCTURE (CONTINUOUS VS. PATCHY) AFFECT MOVEMENT OF TRANSLOCATED TURTLES. A HARD-RELEASE CONSISTS OF RELEASING INDIVIDUALS TO THEIR NEW ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT ANY PRIOR ACCLIMATION, WHEREAS A SOFT-RELEASE FORCES ANIMALS TO SPEND TIME AT THE RELEASE SITE PRIOR TO RELEASE. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE TRANSLOCATION TECHNIQUE DEPENDS UPON HABITAT STRUCTURE. A SOFT-RELEASE WAS EFFECTIVE IN MINIMIZING POST-RELEASE DISPERSAL OF TRANSLOCATED TURTLES IN A CONTINUOUS LOTIC HABITAT AS THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE MOVEMENT OF SOFT-RELEASED AND RESIDENT TURTLES. HOWEVER, HARD-RELEASED TURTLES UNDERGO EXTENSIVE MOVEMENT WHEN TRANSLOCATED TO A CONTINUOUS LOTIC HABITAT AS HARD-RELEASED TURTLES HAD GREATER MOVEMENT THAN RESIDENT TURTLES. WHEN THE RELEASE SITE CONSISTS OF A PATCHY WETLAND COMPLEX, A HARD-RELEASE TRANSLOCATION MAY BE EFFECTIVE AS THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE MOVEMENT BETWEEN RESIDENT AND HARD-RELEASED TURTLES.

MONITORING THE RESULTS OF REINTRODUCTIONS IS CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS SHORT- AND LONG-TERM SUCCESS, ADJUSTING MANAGEMENT DECISIONS AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. IN THIS STUDY, WE ASSESSED THE FIRST 15 YEARS OF THE CAPTIVE BREEDING AND RESTOCKING PROGRAM FOR THE EUROPEAN POND TURTLE EMYS ORBICULARIS IN LIGURIA, NORTHERN ITALY. WE ESTIMATED SURVIVAL OF RELEASED TURTLES BY MODELLING MARK-RECAPTURE MONITORING DATA. WE THEN USED THOSE ESTIMATES TO UPDATE OUR PRIOR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT LONG-TERM OUTCOMES, AND TO ADJUST MANAGEMENT DECISIONS ABOUT THE AGE OF INDIVIDUALS TO RELEASE. MODELLING RESULTS SUGGEST RELEASED TURTLES HAD SUFFICIENTLY HIGH SURVIVAL, MATCHING PRIOR EXPECTATIONS, SUCH THAT LOCAL EXTINCTION HAS BEEN AVERTED IN THE SHORT-TERM. SURVIVAL WAS SIMILAR AMONG CARIDIDATE AGE CLASSES FOR RELEASES, SUGGESTING THE RELEASE OF YOUNGER INDIVIDUALS CAN PROVIDE POSITIVE OUTCOMES WHILE REDUCING MANAGEMENT COSTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, SURVIVAL VARIED AMONG SITES, INDICATING THE NEED FOR ONGOING IN-SITU HABITAT MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE LONG-TERM PERSISTENCE. MOREOVER, THE LATE ONSET OF SEXUAL MATURITY IN THE SPECIES MEANS REPRODUCTION OF RELEASED ANIMALS CANNOT YET BE DETERMINED WITH CERTAINTY.

THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE THE LIMITED QUANTITY OF RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON ANIMAL REINTRODUCTIONS HAS SHOWN VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS IN ESTABLISHING NEW POPULATIONS. THE REASONS WHY SOME REINTRODUCTIONS ARE SUCCESSFUL, WHEREAS OTHERS ARE NOT, ARE OFTEN NOT CLEAR. AIMS THE PRESENT RESEARCH AIMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER REPTILE REINTRODUCTION INTO RESTORED MINE PITS IS A POTENTIAL MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE FOR MANAGING AND CONSERVING REPTILE POPULATIONS WITHIN A MINED LANDSCAPE. METHODS TWELVE NAPOLEON’S SKINKS WERE TRAPPED THEN FITTED WITH 0.9-G TRANSMITTERS. HALF WERE REINTRODUCED INTO 5-YEAR-OLD RESTORED MINE PITS AND THE OTHER HALF INTO UNMINED FOREST. BODYWEIGHTS, MOVEMENT PATTERNS AND MACRO-HABITAT SELECTION WERE RECORDED WEEKLY DURING NOVEMBER AND THEN MONTHLY UNTIL MARCH. KEY RESULTS SKINKS REINTRODUCED INTO RESTORED SITES QUICKLY MOVED INTO UNMINED FOREST. BOTH GROUPS OF SKINKS MOVED LARGE DISTANCES, BUT THOSE REINTRODUCED INTO RESTORED SITES TRAVELLED FURTHER THAN DID CONTROL SKINKS AND TOOK LONGER TO REDUCE THEIR DISTANCES TRAVELLED, SHOWING POSSIBLE STRESS AS A RESULT OF RELEASE INTO UNSUITABLE HABITAT. EVENTUALLY, ALMOST ALL SKINKS FOUND SUITABLE HABITAT IN UNMINED FOREST AND SETTLED INTO THESE AREAS WHILE CONTINUING TO GAIN WEIGHT. CONCLUSIONS REINTRODUCTION WAS AN INEFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE FOR FACILITATING COLONISATION OF RESTORED MINESITES BY NAPOLEON’S SKINK. LACK OF SUITABLE MICRO-HABITATS WITHIN RESTORATION AREAS, SUCH AS GROUND LOGS AND COARSE, WOODY DEBRIS PILES, IS LIKELY LIMITING THE USE OF THESE AREAS BY NAPOLEON’S SKINKS AND IS LIKELY TO BE THE CAUSE OF THEIR FAILURE TO REMAIN OR SETTLE IN RESTORED SITES AFTER REINTRODUCTION. IMPLICATIONS DETERMINING THE HABITAT REQUIREMENTS OF SKINKS AND REPLICATING THIS IN RESTORATION SITES WOULD SEEM THE MORE APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT OPTION THAN IS REINTRODUCTION, AND THIS MAY BE THE CASE FOR OTHER REPTILES AND HABITAT SPECIALISTS.",2

WITHIN THE TUNA AND SWORDFISH FISHERIES, THE INCIDENTAL SEA TURTLE BYCATCH IS USUALLY MORE FREQUENT FROM LONGLINE FISHERIES TARGETING SWORDFISH. THEREFORE IT IS IMPORTANT TO TEST POSSIBLE MITIGATION MEASURES, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WHERE FISHING ACTIVITIES AND HIGH ABUNDANCE OF THESE SPECIES OVERLAPS, AS IS THE CASE OF THE TROPICAL NORTHEAST ATLANTIC OCEAN. BETWEEN AUGUST 2008 AND DECEMBER 2011, A TOTAL OF 202 EXPERIMENTAL PELAGIC LONGLINE SETS WERE CARRIED OUT IN THAT REGION (LATITUDE: 11-22°N, LONGITUDE: 20-38°W). THE AIM WAS TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING THE TRADITIONAL J-STYLE HOOKS (10° OFFSET) BAITED WITH SQUID USED BY THE FISHING INDUSTRY, AGAINST TWO CIRCLE HOOKS (ONE NON-OFFSET AND ONE WITH 10° OFFSET) AND MACKEREL BAIT. FOUR SEA TURTLE SPECIES WERE CAPTURED, WITH THE LEATHERBACK DERMOCHELYS CORIACEA COMPRISING MOST OF THE BYCATCHES (BPUE, BYCATCH PER UNIT OF EFFORT USING THE TRADITIONAL CONFIGURATION OF 0.990 TURTLES/1000 HOOKS), FOLLOWED BY THREE HARDSHELL SPECIES: THE LOGGERHEAD CARETTA CARETTA AND THE OLIVE RIDLEY LEPIDOCHELYS OLIVACEA (BPUE. =. 0.165 TURTLES/1000 HOOKS), AND THE KEMP RIDLEY LEPIDOCHELYS KEMPII (BPUE. =. 0.024 TURTLES/1000 HOOKS). IN GENERAL, THE SEA TURTLE INTERACTIONS IN THE FISHERY CAN BE REDUCED BY CHANGING FROM THE TRADITIONAL GEAR TO ONE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL COMBINATIONS. HOWEVER, THOSE REDUCTIONS WERE SPECIES-SPECIFIC, WITH THE LEATHERBACK BYCATCHES REDUCED ONLY WHEN CHANGING FROM J-STYLE TO THE NON-OFFSET CIRCLE HOOK, WHILE FOR THE HARDSHELL TURTLES BOTH THE HOOK STYLE (USING A CIRCLE HOOK, WITH OR WITHOUT OFFSET) AND THE BAIT (USING MACKEREL) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE INCIDENTAL BYCATCHES. HOOKING LOCATION WAS ALSO SPECIES-SPECIFIC, WITH MOST HARDSHELL SPECIMENS HOOKED BY THE MOUTH AND ESOPHAGUS, WHILE LEATHERBACKS WERE MOSTLY HOOKED EXTERNALLY BY THE FLIPPERS.

WE USED DRIFT FENCES WITH PITFALL TRAPS TO EXPERIMENTALLY ASSESS HOW HERPETOFAUNAL SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES RESPONDED TO EARLY, GROWING-SEASON BURNS, DORMANT-SEASON BURNS, AND UNBURNED CONTROLS. WE DOCUMENTED NO ADVERSE EFFECTS OF EITHER GROWING-SEASON BURNS OR DORMANT-SEASON BURNS ON ANY COMMON HERPETOFAUNAL TAXA, BUT CAPTURE RATES OF TOTAL, ADULT, AND JUVENILE FIVE-LINED SKINKS (PLESTIODON FASCIATUS) WERE GREATER FOLLOWING GROWING-SEASON BURNS. MOST MEASUREMENTS REFLECTED LITTLE OR TRANSIENT CHANGE IN FOREST STRUCTURE. HOWEVER, CANOPY COVER DECREASED BY AN AVERAGE OF 16% IN GROWING-SEASON BURNS WITHIN FOUR GROWING-SEASONS OF BURNING, WITH SOME TREE MORTALITY IN PATCHES WHERE FIRE TEMPERATURE LIKELY WAS HOTTER. OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT EVEN MODEST REDUCTIONS IN CANOPY COVER MAY POSITIVELY AFFECT RELATIVE ABUNDANCE AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF P. FASCIATUS. WE CAUTIOUSLY SUGGEST THAT A HIGHER MEAN GROUND-LEVEL FIRE TEMPERATURE AND THE PHYSIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE CONDITION OF VEGETATION IN GROWING-SEASON BURNS INTERACTED TO DAMAGE A GREATER PROPORTION OF TREES, RESULTING IN MORE CANOPY THINNING THAN IN DORMANT-SEASON BURNS. HOWEVER, WEATHER, FUEL TYPES AND CONDITION, VEGETATION STRUCTURE, AND TOPOGRAPHY INTERACT TO AFFECT FIRE INTENSITY AND THE LEVEL OF MORTALITY OR DAMAGE TO CANOPY TREES WITHIN AND AMONG STANDS, REGARDLESS OF SEASON CONDUCTED.

WHILE MANY POSSIBLE FACTORS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO LOW TRANSLOCATION SUCCESS, OUTCOMES ARE OFTEN IMPROVED WHEN RESEARCHERS ENGAGE IN A SOFT RELEASE, WHICH PROVIDES THE ANIMALS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EXTRA TIME TO ACCLIMATE TO THEIR RELEASE SITE, INDICATING THAT ASPECTS OF LEARNING MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN TRANSLOCATION SUCCESS. TO TEST THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TIME AVAILABLE FOR LEARNING IN TRANSLOCATION SUCCESS, WE PERFORMED HARD AND SOFT RELEASES INTO AN EXISTING POPULATION OF EASTERN PAINTED TURTLES CHRYSEMYS PICTA THAT HAS EXPERIENCED SEASONAL EPHEMERAL WATER SOURCES AND IN WHICH RESIDENT TURTLES NAVIGATE TO NEW PERMANENT SOURCES OF WATER WITH EXTREME PRECISION (+/- 3.5M) USING SPECIFIC ROUTES KNOWN TO BE FACILITATED BY LEARNING. TRANSLOCATED ADULT TURTLES IN BOTH HARD- AND SOFT-RELEASE GROUPS FAILED TO SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATE UPLAND HABITAT, EVEN WHEN GIVEN 3MONTHS TO PROSPECT AND LEARN (THE MAXIMUM TIME POSSIBLE IN OUR SYSTEM). LIKEWISE, TURTLES IN BOTH GROUPS MOVED MORE SLOWLY, STOPPED MORE FREQUENTLY, AND WERE SLOWER TO RESTART MOVEMENT THAN RESIDENT ADULTS. FINALLY, BOTH TRANSLOCATED GROUPS EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT DROPS IN BODY MASS AND ELEVATED RATES OF PREDATION. IN CONTRAST, JUVENILES FROM THE SAME DONOR POPULATION NAVIGATED TO ALTERNATIVE WATER SUCCESSFULLY, WITH MOVEMENTS AND MORTALITY RATES NOT DIFFERENT FROM RESIDENT ANIMALS. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT COMPLEX ASPECTS OF COGNITION BEYOND TIME TO LEARN CAN INFLUENCE TRANSLOCATION SUCCESS AND HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING HOW AND WHEN ANIMALS LEARN.",1

THE AIM WAS TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF VEGETATION TYPE, STOCKING RATE AND OTHER LANDSCAPE-SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WERE ON THE PATTERNS RECORDED. SIXTEEN 1-HA SITES WERE ESTABLISHED WITHIN THREE REPLICATED TREATMENTS (MODERATE, HEAVY AND VARIABLE STOCKING RATES). THE SITES WERE SAMPLED IN THE WET AND DRY SEASONS IN 1999–2000 (T0) AND AGAIN IN 2003–04 (T1). ALL PADDOCKS OF THE TREATMENTS WERE BURNT IN 1999. AVERAGE ANNUAL RAINFALL DECLINED MARKEDLY BETWEEN THE TWO SAMPLING PERIODS, WHICH MADE INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA DIFFICULT. A TOTAL OF 127 SPECIES OF VERTEBRATE FAUNA COMPRISING FIVE AMPHIBIAN, 83 BIRD, 27 REPTILE AND 12 MAMMAL SPECIES WERE RECORDED. THERE WAS STRONG SEPARATION IN FAUNAL COMPOSITION FROM T0 TO T1 ALTHOUGH CHANGES IN MEAN COMPOSITIONAL DISSIMILARITY BETWEEN THE GRAZING STOCKING RATE TREATMENTS WERE LESS WELL DEFINED. THERE WAS A RELATIVE CHANGE IN ABUNDANCE OF 24 BIRD, FOUR MAMMAL AND FIVE REPTILE SPECIES FROM T0 TO T1. THE GENERALISED LINEAR MODELLING IDENTIFIED THAT, IN THE T1 DATA, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN THE ABUNDANCE OF 16 SPECIES EXPLAINED BY THE GRAZING AND VEGETATION FACTORS. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT VERTEBRATE FAUNA ASSEMBLAGE DID CHANGE AND THAT THESE CHANGES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE STOCKING RATES, THE VEGETATION TYPES ON THE SITES SURVEYED, THE BURNING OF THE EXPERIMENTAL PADDOCKS AND THE DECREASE IN RAINFALL OVER THE COURSE OF THE TWO SURVEYS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE EXPERIMENT IS SAMPLED AGAIN BUT THAT THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON A RAPID SURVEY OF ABUNDANT TAXA (I.E. BIRDS AND REPTILES) TO ALLOW AN INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF SAMPLING AND REPLICATION OF THE DATA. THIS WOULD HELP TO ARTICULATE MORE CLEARLY THE TRAJECTORY OF VERTEBRATE CHANGE DUE TO THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF STOCKING RATES COMPARED WITH WIDER LANDSCAPE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES.

USING PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES OF ANOXIA, THIS STUDY DETERMINED WHETHER PROVIDING AIR SPACES USING FLOATS WITHIN FYKE NETS COULD PREVENT TURTLES FROM DROWNING. IN A CONTROLLED SETTING, BLOOD LACTATE AND PH OF PAINTED TURTLES (CHRYSEMYS PICTA) EXPERIMENTALLY INTRODUCED INTO SUBMERGED NETS, NETS WITH FLOATS, AND NETS THAT BREACHED THE SURFACE WERE COMPARED. WHILE EMULATING COMMERCIAL FISHING PRACTICES - WHERE TURTLES AND FISH VOLUNTARILY ENTERED NETS - CATCH RATES AND COMPOSITIONS AS WELL AS BLOOD LACTATE IN TURTLES CAPTURED WERE COMPARED IN SUBMERGED NETS WITH AND WITHOUT FLOATS. PAINTED TURTLES IN SUBMERGED NETS EXHIBITED ELEVATED BLOOD LACTATE AND PRONOUNCED ACIDOSIS COMPARED WITH TURTLES FROM NETS WITH FLOATS AND SURFACED NETS. CATCH RATES AND COMPOSITIONS FROM EMULATED FISHING WERE STATISTICALLY SIMILAR IN NETS WITH AND WITHOUT FLOATS; HOWEVER, TOTAL FISH CATCHES WERE ROUGHLY ONE-THIRD LESS IN NETS WITH FLOATS. THE SAME PATTERN OF PHYSIOLOGICAL DISTURBANCE WAS OBSERVED WITH TURTLES CAPTURED IN SUBMERGED NETS WITH AND WITHOUT FLOATS AS IN THE CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT. OVERALL, BLOOD PHYSIOLOGY INDICATED THAT ANOXIA OCCURRED IN TURTLES IN SUBMERGED NETS WHILE NETS WITH FLOATS REDUCED PHYSIOLOGICAL DISTURBANCE. HOWEVER, VARIATION IN BLOOD LACTATE LEVELS WHEN FISHING FYKE NETS WITH FLOATS SUGGESTS THAT TURTLES WERE EXPERIENCING SLIGHT ANOXIA AND SO THE SIZE OF AIR SPACES MAY BE IMPORTANT IN ALLOWING ACCESS TO AIR.

A PATCH-BURN GRAZING STUDY AT OSAGE PRAIRIE, MO, USA IN 2011-2012 CREATED LANDSCAPE PATCHES WITH TREATMENTS OF GRAZING, FIRE, AND SUCH LEGACIES.

I CONDUCTED REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS AND A PERMUTED MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE TO DETERMINE IF PATCH TYPE AND THE ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS EXPLAINED HERPETOFAUNA ASSEMBLAGE. ESTIMATES FOR REPTILES INDICATE THAT OCCUPANCY WAS SEASONALLY CONSTANT IN CONTROL PATCHES (&#X3C8; ~ 0.5), BUT DECLINED TO &#X3C8; ~ 0.15 IN PATCHES FOLLOWING THE APPLICATIONS OF FIRE AND GRAZING. LOCAL EXTINCTIONS FOR REPTILES WERE HIGHER IN PATCHES WITH FIRE OR LIGHT GRAZING (&#X3B5; ~ 0.7) COMPARED TO THE CONTROLS. FOR THE RIPARIAN HERPETOFAUNAL COMMUNITY, PATCH TYPE AND GRASS HEIGHT WERE IMPORTANT PREDICTORS OF ABUNDANCE; FURTHER, THE TURTLES, LIZARDS, SNAKES, AND ADULT AMPHIBIANS USED DIFFERENT PATCH TYPES. THE AQUATIC AMPHIBIAN COMMUNITY WAS PREDICTED BY WATERSHED AND IN-STREAM CHARACTERISTICS, IRRESPECTIVE OF FIRE OR GRAZING.

DURING 2013 AND 2014, WE MEASURED VEGETATION AND MONITORED HERPETOFAUNA VIA TRAPPING AND VISUAL ENCOUNTER SURVEYS (VES) AT LOCATIONS AFFECTED BY BIOCONTROL ALONG THE VIRGIN RIVER IN THE MOJAVE DESERT OF THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES. TWENTY-ONE SITES WERE DIVIDED INTO FOUR RIPARIAN STAND TYPES BASED ON DENSITY AND PERCENT COVER OF DOMINANT TREES (TAMARIX, PROSOPIS, POPULUS, AND SALIX) AND PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF RESTORATION. RESTORATION ACTIVITIES CONSISTED OF MECHANICALLY REMOVING NON-NATIVE TREES, TRANSPLANTING NATIVE TREES, AND RESTORING HYDROLOGIC FLOWS. RESTORED SITES HAD THREE TIMES MORE TOTAL LIZARD AND EIGHT TIMES MORE YELLOW-BACKED SPINY LIZARD (SCELOPORUS UNIFORMIS) CAPTURES THAN OTHER STAND TYPES. WOODHOUSE'S TOAD (ANAXYRUS WOODHOUSII) CAPTURES WERE GREATEST IN UNRESTORED AND RESTORED TAM-POP/SAL SITES. RESULTS FROM VES INDICATED THAT HERPETOFAUNA ABUNDANCE WAS GREATEST IN THE RESTORED TAM-POP/SAL SITE COMPARED WITH THE ADJACENT UNRESTORED TAM-POP/SAL SITE. TAM SITES WERE CHARACTERIZED BY HAVING HIGH TAMARIX COVER, PERCENT CANOPY COVER, AND SHADE. RESTORED TAM-POP/SAL SITES WERE MOST SIMILAR IN HABITAT TO TAM-POP/SAL SITES. TWO SPECIES OF HERPETOFAUNA (SPINY LIZARD AND TOAD) WERE FOUND TO PREFER HABITAT COMPONENTS CHARACTERISTIC OF RESTORED TAM-POP/SAL SITES.

TURTLE INTERACTIONS WITH GEAR CAN BE DEFINED AS THOSE THAT ARE "" OBSERVABLE"" BASED ON STANDARD FISHERY OBSERVER PROTOCOLS, PLUS UNOBSERVED INTERACTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE BOTH QUANTIFIABLE AND UNQUANTIFIABLE INTERACTIONS. ONCE A GEAR MODIFICATION IS IN PLACE, A TURTLE INTERACTION THAT WAS ONCE OBSERVABLE MAY BECOME UNOBSERVABLE, BECAUSE THE GEAR MODIFICATION SUCCESSFULLY PREVENTED THE TURTLE FROM BEING CAPTURED. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES TURTLE INTERACTIONS IN SCALLOP DREDGE GEAR FROM 2001 TO 2008, IDENTIFIES GEAR AND ENVIRONMENTAL CORRELATES WITH OBSERVABLE INTERACTION RATES, AND REPORTS THE AVERAGE ANNUAL NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS AND ADULT-EQUIVALENT INTERACTIONS BEFORE AND AFTER CHAIN MATS WERE MANDATED IN THE FISHERY. FISHERIES OBSERVER DATA WERE USED TO DEVELOP A GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODEL (GAM) TO ESTIMATE RATES OF OBSERVABLE INTERACTIONS OF HARD-SHELLED TURTLES. THESE RATES WERE APPLIED TO COMMERCIAL DREDGE FISHING EFFORT TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OBSERVABLE INTERACTIONS, AND TO INFER THE NUMBER OF UNOBSERVABLE, YET QUANTIFIABLE INTERACTIONS AFTER CHAIN MATS WERE IMPLEMENTED. INTERACTION RATES OF HARD-SHELLED TURTLES WERE CORRELATED WITH SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE, DEPTH, AND USE OF A CHAIN MAT. THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF ANNUAL OBSERVABLE INTERACTIONS OF HARD-SHELLED TURTLES IN THE MID-ATLANTIC SCALLOP DREDGE FISHERY PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CHAIN MATS (1 JANUARY 2001 THROUGH 25 SEPTEMBER 2006) WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 288 TURTLES (CV = 0.14, 95% CI: 209-363), WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO 49 ADULTS.

IN SPITE OF GROWING RELIANCE ON TRANSLOCATIONS IN WILDLIFE CONSERVATION, TRANSLOCATION EFFICACY REMAINS INCONSISTENT. ONE FACTOR THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO FAILED TRANSLOCATIONS IS RELEASING ANIMALS INTO POOR-QUALITY OR OTHERWISE INADEQUATE HABITAT. 2. HERE, WE USED A TARGETED APPROACH TO TEST THE RELATIONSHIP OF HABITAT FEATURES TO POST-TRANSLOCATION DISPERSAL AND SURVIVAL OF JUVENILE MOJAVE DESERT TORTOISES GOPHERUS AGASSIZII. 3. WE SELECTED THREE HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS - RODENT BURROWS, SUBSTRATE TEXTURE (PREVALENCE AND SIZE OF ROCKS) AND WASHES (EPHEMERAL RIVER BEDS) - THAT ARE TIED TO DESERT TORTOISE ECOLOGY. AT THE POINT OF RELEASE, WE DOCUMENTED RODENT BURROW ABUNDANCE, SUBSTRATE TEXTURE AND WASH PRESENCE AND ANALYSED THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE MAXIMUM DISPERSAL. WE ALSO DOCUMENTED THE RELATIVE USE BY EACH INDIVIDUAL FOR EACH HABITAT CHARACTERISTIC AND ANALYSED THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH SURVIVAL AND FATAL ENCOUNTERS WITH A PREDATOR IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER RELEASE. 4. IN GENERAL, THE PRESENCE OF REFUGIA OR OTHER AREAS THAT ENABLED ANIMALS TO AVOID DETECTION, SUCH AS BURROWS AND SUBSTRATE, DECREASED THE OVERALL MORTALITY AS WELL AS PREDATOR-MEDIATED MORTALITY. THE PRESENCE OF WASHES AND SUBSTRATE THAT ENHANCED THE TORTOISES' ABILITY TO AVOID DETECTION ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDUCED DISPERSAL AWAY FROM THE RELEASE SITE. THESE RESULTS INDICATE AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR ALL THREE MEASURED HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS IN DRIVING DISPERSAL, SURVIVAL OR FATAL ENCOUNTERS WITH A PREDATOR IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER TRANSLOCATION. 5.

TRIALS ASSESSING CIRCLE HOOKS OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND SHAPES, AND DIFFERENT BAITS, HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS IN THE REDUCTION OF SEA TURTLE BYCATCH AND CHANGES IN HOOKING LOCATION. IN THIS PAPER, INFORMATION FROM 1823 OLIVE RIDLEY SEA TURTLES INCIDENTALLY CAPTURED IN THE EPO WERE ANALYZED TO ASSESS HOW HOOK TYPE (J, TUNA HOOKS OR CIRCLE HOOKS), HOOK SIZE, BAIT TYPE (SQUID OR FISH), TURTLE SIZE AND TARGET SPECIES (TUNAS, SHARKS OR MAHI-MAHI) AFFECT HOOKING LOCATION ON SEA TURTLES. THIS WERE MODELED WITH A CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION TREE USING HOOKING LOCATION AS A MULTINOMIAL VARIABLE RESPONSE (FOR 6 CATEGORIES OF HOOKING LOCATIONS); AND ALSO AS A BINOMIAL RESPONSE (SWALLOWED VS. NON-SWALLOWED) USING A GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODEL (GLMM). HOOK TYPE AND SIZE, PLUS BAIT TYPE, WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS AFFECTING HOOKING LOCATION, WHILE TURTLE SIZE AND TARGET SPECIES DID NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. J-HOOKS AND TUNA HOOKS HAD A MUCH GREATER PROBABILITY OF BEING SWALLOWED THAN CIRCLE HOOKS. IN ADDITION, AS THE HOOK SIZE INCREASED, THE LIKELIHOOD OF SWALLOWING IT DECREASED. THE USE OF FISH BAIT IN COMBINATION WITH LARGER CIRCLE HOOKS TENDED TO PRODUCE HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF EXTERNAL HOOKINGS.

WE ASKED THE QUESTION: HOW DO REMNANT PATCHES, PADDOCK TYPES AND GRAZING REGIMES INFLUENCE REPTILE ASSEMBLAGES IN A GRAZING LANDSCAPE? 2. AT 12 SITES, WE SURVEYED REPTILES AND ENVIRONMENTAL COVARIATES IN REMNANT WOODLAND PATCHES AND IN FOUR PADDOCK TYPES: (I) GRAZED PASTURE, (II) LINEAR PLANTINGS, (III) COARSE WOODY DEBRIS (CWD) ADDED TO GRAZED PASTURE AND (IV) FENCES BETWEEN GRAZED PASTURE. EACH SITE WAS EITHER CONTINUOUSLY OR ROTATIONALLY GRAZED. 3. REMNANT VEGETATION AND OTHER VEGETATION ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS TREE COVER AND LEAF LITTER GREATLY INFLUENCED REPTILES. WE RECORDED HIGHER REPTILE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN AREAS WITH MORE TREE COVER AND LEAF LITTER. FOR RARE SPECIES (CAPTURED IN <= 4 SITES < 70 CAPTURES), THERE WERE 5.7 MORE ANIMALS AND 2.6 MORE SPECIES IN SITES WITH 50\% WOODY COVER WITHIN 3 KM COMPARED TO 5\% WOODY COVER. 4. THE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS OF RARE SPECIES, AND ONE COMMON SPECIES DIFFERED BETWEEN PADDOCK TYPES AND WERE HIGHER IN LINEAR PLANTINGS AND FENCE TRANSECTS COMPARED TO CWD AND PASTURE TRANSECTS. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. GRAZED PADDOCKS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH KEY FEATURES SUCH AS FENCES AND PLANTINGS CAN PROVIDE HABITAT FOR REPTILES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT DISCRETE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN PATCH AND MATRIX DOES NOT APPLY FOR REPTILES IN THESE SYSTEMS. MANAGEMENT TO PROMOTE REPTILE CONSERVATION IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES SHOULD INVOLVE PROTECTING EXISTING REMNANT VEGETATION, REGARDLESS OF AMOUNT; AND PROMOTE KEY HABITAT FEATURES OF TREES, LEAF LITTER AND SHRUBS. ESTABLISHING PLANTINGS AND FENCES IS IMPORTANT AS THEY SUPPORT HIGH NUMBERS OF LESS COMMON REPTILES AND MAY FACILITATE REPTILES TO MOVE THROUGH AND USE GREATER AMOUNTS OF THE LANDSCAPE.",3

ROADS ARE KNOWN TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT SPECIES, BUT RAILWAYS CAN OFTEN CAUSE SIMILAR EFFECTS. CERTAIN TAXA, SUCH AS TURTLES AND TORTOISES, ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO RAILWAYS THAN OTHERS DUE TO LIMITATIONS IN MOBILITY. WE STUDIED THE IMPACT OF RAILS ON THE MOVEMENT AND BEHAVIOR OF GOPHER TORTOISES (GOPHERUS POLYPHEMUS), A THREATENED, HIGHLY TERRESTRIAL SPECIES LIKELY IN FREQUENT CONTACT WITH RAILWAYS. FIRST, WE USED RADIO-TELEMETRY TO DETERMINE THE FREQUENCY OF RAILWAY CROSSINGS AND COMPARED THIS TO CORRELATED RANDOM WALK (CRW) SIMULATIONS TO ASSESS IF TORTOISES WERE CROSSING THE RAILS LESS FREQUENTLY THAN IS EXPECTED BY UNCONSTRAINED MOVEMENT. SECOND, WE PLACED TORTOISES INTO THE RAILWAY AND MEASURED BEHAVIOR FOR ONE HOUR TO ASSESS CROSSING ABILITY. LASTLY, WE TESTED WHETHER TRENCHES DUG UNDERNEATH THE RAILS COULD ALLOW SAFE PASSAGE FOR TORTOISES. WE FOUND THAT RAILWAYS IMPACTED THE MOVEMENT OF GOPHER TORTOISES. GOPHER TORTOISES CROSSED THE RAILWAY LESS OFTEN THAN WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED BY UNHINDERED MOVEMENT FOR FIVE OF OUR TEN TORTOISES TRACKED. DURING BEHAVIORAL TRIALS, 0 OF 24 TORTOISES PLACED WITHIN THE RAILWAYS WERE CAPABLE OF ESCAPING FROM THE RAILS. USING GAME CAMERAS, WE DETECTED TORTOISES USING TRENCHES DUG UNDERNEATH THE RAILS AND BETWEEN THE TIES 68 TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF A SINGLE SUMMER. FOR MINIMAL FINANCIAL COST, THE TRENCHES FACILITATED TORTOISE MOVEMENT ACROSS THE RAILWAY, MAINTAINED FULL RAIL FUNCTIONALITY, AND CREATED AN ESCAPE ROUTE FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE TRAPPED BETWEEN THE RAILS, AND THUS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AS A MITIGATION STRATEGY. GIVEN THE THOUSANDS OF KM OF RAILWAYS AROUND THE WORLD, WE RECOMMEND FUTURE STUDIES FOCUS ON THE NEW FIELD OF RAIL ECOLOGY.",1

IN TOTAL, 310 LONGLINE SETS WERE CARRIED OUT BETWEEN 2008 AND 2012. THREE DIFFERENT HOOK STYLES WERE TESTED, TRADITIONAL J HOOK (9/0) AND TWO 17/0 CIRCLE HOOKS (A NON-OFFSET AND A 10O OFFSET), BUT ONLY ONE BAIT TYPE WAS USED IN EACH SET (SCOMBER SPP. OR ILLEX SPP.). TWO SPECIES OF SEA TURTLES WERE CAUGHT, THE LEATHERBACK DERMOCHELYS CORIACEA, AND THE LOGGERHEAD CARETTA CARETTA, THE LATTER COMPRISING THE MAJORITY OF THE CATCHES. THE HIGHEST MEAN BYCATCH PER UNIT OF EFFORT VALUES FOR BOTH SPECIES COMBINED (1.693/1000 HOOKS) AND FOR THE INDIVIDUAL SPECIES (1.505/1000 HOOKS FOR LOGGERHEADS) OCCURRED WITH J-STYLE HOOKS BAITED WITH SQUID. CHANGING FROM J-STYLE TO ONE OF THE CIRCLE HOOKS WAS ONLY SIGNIFICANT WHEN USING SQUID BAIT (WITH THE ODDS-RATIOS DECREASING BETWEEN 54% AND 63%).

TURTLES WERE LESS LIKELY TO SWALLOW HOOKS BAITED WITH SARDINES THAN WITH SQUID AND SINGLE-BAITED RATHER THAN THREADED BAITS. RESULTS ARE LIKELY DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN BAIT TEXTURE, HOOK SHIELDING EFFECTS, AND TURTLES' BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES. WE SUGGEST THAT FISHING WITH LARGE HOOKS, USING FINFISH INSTEAD OF SQUID, AND USING SINGLE-BAITED INSTEAD OF THREADED BAITS MIGHT REDUCE DEEP INGESTION RATES OF HOOKS BY LOGGERHEADS AS LARGE AS 65 CM IN STANDARD STRAIGHT CARAPACE LENGTH (NOTCH TO TIP). © INTER-RESEARCH 2011.",2

ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES OF FACTORS INFLUENCING FAUNAL RECOLONIZATION HAVE EXAMINED THE INFLUENCE OF IN SITU SITE FACTORS, FEWER HAVE EXAMINED THE INFLUENCE OF NEIGHBORHOOD LANDSCAPE FACTORS, ESPECIALLY IN LANDSCAPES WITH PERMEABLE MATRICES. TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF LANDSCAPE AND SITE FACTORS ON REPTILE RECOLONIZATION IN A PRODUCTION LANDSCAPE WITH A PERMEABLE MATRIX, WE SURVEYED REPTILES AT INTACT REFERENCE SITES AND POST-MINING RESTORATION SITES (3–20 YEARS POST-MINING [YPM]) IN A FOREST ECOSYSTEM IN SOUTHWESTERN AUSTRALIA. REPTILE ASSEMBLAGES IN RESTORATION SITES NEVER CONVERGED ON THOSE IN REFERENCE HABITAT. REPTILE SPECIES COMPOSITION AND INDIVIDUAL SPECIES ABUNDANCES (>20 DETECTIONS) IN RESTORATION SITES WERE PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY SITE FACTORS SUCH AS CANOPY HEIGHT, LITTER COVER, AND COARSE WOODY DEBRIS VOLUME, AND NOT BY LANDSCAPE FACTORS. WE SUGGEST THAT THE MOST COMMON REPTILE SPECIES IN OUR STUDY AREA ARE PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY SITE FACTORS, NOT LANDSCAPE FACTORS, AND MOST REPTILES DETECTED IN RESTORATION SITES WERE PRESENT BY 3–4 YPM.

WE SELECTED THREE FORMERLY HIGH-DENSITY TORTOISE AREAS TO CARRY OUT DIFFERENT TRIALS WHOSE AIMS WERE TO: (1) IDENTIFY NEST PREDATOR SPECIES, (2) TEST THE SUCCESS OF REDUCING THE SHRUB COVER TO REDUCE NEST PREDATION IN POTENTIAL NEW NESTING AREAS, AND (3) ASSESS FENCING EFFICIENCY TO EXCLUDE PREDATORS. FOR THE FIRST OBJECTIVE, CAMERA-TRAPPING WAS USED TO IDENTIFY NEST PREDATORS, WITH SARDINES AND ARTIFICIAL TORTOISE NESTS AS LURES. WE OBTAINED 825 PICTURES OF POSSIBLE PREDATORS AND DEMONSTRATED THAT THE BEECH MARTEN WAS THE MOST ABUNDANT PREDATOR IN THE STUDY AREAS, FOLLOWED BY THE BADGER AND THE WILD BOAR. FOR THE SECOND OBJECTIVE, PREDATION OF ARTIFICIAL NESTS WAS COMPARED BETWEEN PLOTS MANAGED FOR SHRUB REDUCTION (27 PLOTS OF 4, 25, AND 100 M2) AND A NATURAL NESTING AREA (NINE CONTROL PLOTS OF 100 M2).

WITH THIS AIM WE FIRST STUDIED THE HOME RANGE AND HABITAT PREFERENCES IN WESTERN HERMANN’S TORTOISES BY RADIO TRACKING 15 ADULTS WEEKLY FROM MARCH 2008 TO MAY 2009 IN THREE LOCALITIES WITHIN THE ALBERA POPULATION RANGE (NE IBERIAN PENINSULA). WE ESTIMATED HOME RANGES WITH FIXED KERNEL ESTIMATOR (FK) AND MINIMUM CONVEX POLYGON (MCP) AFTER CHECKING TORTOISE SITE FIDELITY. WE OBSERVED THAT HOME RANGE SIZE DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES (MEAN FK = 2.01 HA, MEAN MCP = 3.01 HA). SECONDLY, WE STUDIED MACROHABITAT SELECTION USING A VEGETATION MAP. PREFERRED HABITATS WERE OPEN SHRUBLAND, OPEN FOREST AND BARREN LAND DURING THE ACTIVITY PERIOD, AND DENSE FOREST, DENSE SHRUBLAND AND OPEN SHRUBLAND DURING THE HIBERNATION. NEXT, WE ASSESSED MICROHABITAT SELECTION ALONG FIVE PERIODS OF THE ANNUAL CYCLE: HIBERNATION, EMERGENCE FROM HIBERNATION, SPRING, SUMMER AND AUTUMN. WE THEN LOCATED MARKED TORTOISES WEEKLY AND CLASSIFIED THE PLANT SPECIES OBSERVED IN EACH LOCATION. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSES SHOWED THAT TORTOISES SELECTED SHRUBS WITH TREES DURING HIBERNATION, BRAMBLE DURING SUMMER AND HERBACEOUS HABITAT DURING THE BREEDING SEASON. ALL THESE RESULTS CAN PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS THAT SET ASIDE AREAS OF HABITAT CRITICAL TO CONSERVE VIABLE POPULATIONS, ALTHOUGH IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO PREVENT MORTALITY FROM FORESTRY WORKS.

SHADING DECREASED NEST TEMPERATURE, AND HIGHER NEST TEMPERATURES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER SIZED HATCHLINGS THAT HAD DECREASED LOCOMOTION PERFORMANCE. THE USE OF SHADING TO MINIMIZE NEST TEMPERATURE IS A MANAGEMENT STRATEGY THAT MAY BE USED TO MITIGATE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF INCREASED GLOBAL TEMPERATURES AT SOME ROOKERIES. HERE, WE EXPLORED THE VIABILITY OF NATURAL SHADING OPTIONS, SUCH AS THE PLANTING OF TREES BEHIND NESTING BEACHES, FOR COMBATING THE ADVERSE EFFECT OF INCREASED NEST TEMPERATURE CAUSED BY INCREASED AIR TEMPERATURES.© 2013 ELSEVIER B.V.",1

DESERTIFICATION IS A MAJOR THREAT TO DEGRADED STEPPE HABITATS, PROMPTING RE-VEGETATION EFFORTS TO SLOW WIND EROSION. THESE PROCESSES ALTER BOTH THE STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF THE VEGETATION, AND THUS COULD INFLUENCE PREDATOR AND PREY ABUNDANCES, AND THEIR INTERACTIONS. WE INVESTIGATED HOW HABITAT STRUCTURE (DEGRADED [SPARSE], NATURAL [INTERMEDIATE], OR RE-VEGETATED [DENSE]) INFLUENCES LIZARD SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE, AND DIVERSITY, AND THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE PREDATORS AND INVERTEBRATE PREY IN THE ARID DESERT STEPPE. STRUCTURALLY SPARSE AND DENSE VEGETATION SUPPORTED HIGHER LIZARD ABUNDANCES THAN NATURAL HABITATS, WITH PLUYNOCEPHALUS FRONTALIS AND EREMIAS ARGUS DOMINATING SPARSE AND DENSE HABITATS RESPECTIVELY, AND P. FRONTALIS AND E. MULTIOCELLATA CO-DOMINATING NATURAL HABITATS. HABITATS THAT WERE STRUCTURALLY DENSE ALSO SUPPORTED THE MOST COMPLEX TROPHIC INTERACTIONS AMONG PREDATORS AND PREY, WHEREAS STRUCTURALLY SPARSE HABITATS HAD LOW INTERACTION DIVERSITY AND INTERACTION EVENNESS, WITH MOST ENERGY FLOWING ALONG FEW TROPHIC PATHWAYS. STEPPE DEGRADATION THEREFORE SIMPLIFIES COMMUNITY TROPHIC INTERACTIONS, AND RESTORATION THROUGH ENHANCED PROTECTION OF NATURAL STEPPE HABITAT STRUCTURE MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CONSERVATION OF HEALTHY PREDATOR PREY COMMUNITIES. DESERTIFICATION IS A PRESSING ISSUE THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE ARID STEPPE; REVEGETATION EFFORTS RESULTED IN ROBUST COMMUNITIES, IN ADDITION TO PROMOTING PERSISTENCE OF E. ARGUS, WHICH IS ENDEMIC AND THREATENED. MAINTAINING A HETEROGENOUS STRUCTURAL LANDSCAPE THUS MAY BE THE MOST PROMISING WAY TO COMBAT DESERTIFICATION WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RESTORING PREDATOR PREY COMMUNITY COMPOSITION.

THE BBS OFFERS A COLOURFUL INDICATOR OF A CAT'S PRESENCE AND SHOULD THEREFORE ALERT PREY WITH GOOD COLOUR VISION (BIRDS AND HERPETOFAUNA), BUT NOT MOST MAMMALS WITH LIMITED COLOUR VISION. WE ALSO INTERVIEWED THE 82 OWNERS OF CATS IN THE STUDY ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE USING THE BBS AND THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSES OF THEIR CATS. IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE STUDY, WHICH FOCUSED ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT BBS COLOURS, CAPTURES OF PREY WITH GOOD COLOUR VISION WERE REDUCED BY 54% (95% CL 43-64%) WHEN CATS WERE WEARING A BBS OF ANY COLOUR, WITH THE RAINBOW AND RED BBS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE YELLOW WHEN BIRDS WERE PREY. CAPTURES OF MAMMALS WERE NOT REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE SECOND YEAR ASSESSED THE RAINBOW BBS ALONE, AND THOSE DATA COMBINED WITH RAINBOW DATA IN THE FIRST YEAR FOUND A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF 47% (95% CL 43-57%) IN CAPTURE OF PREY WITH GOOD COLOUR VISION, WITH NO EFFECT OF DIFFERENCES ACROSS YEARS. WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT CATS MAINTAINED A LOWER PREDATION RATE ONCE THE BBS WAS REMOVED. SEVENTY-NINE PER CENT OF OWNERS REPORTED THAT THEIR CATS HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE BBS AND ANOTHER 17% REPORTED THAT THEIR CATS ADJUSTED WITHIN 2 DAYS.

IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE RESPONSE OF A SQUAMATE REPTILE ASSEMBLAGE TO DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN OLIVE GROVES. REPTILE COMMUNITIES WERE RECORDED IN AREAS WITH THREE TYPES OF OLIVE GROVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: BARE GROUND, NATURAL COVER CROP, AND MONOSPECIFIC COVER CROP. WE FURTHER COMPARED HABITAT STRUCTURE AND VEGETATION RICHNESS IN THE STUDY AREA IN ORDER TO VERIFY IF MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE AND DIVERSITY OF SQUAMATE REPTILES SPECIES WITHIN OLIVE GROVES. THE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF REPTILES DIFFERED AMONG THE THREE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS MODULATED BY THE AGE OF THE OLIVE TREES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SQUAMATE REPTILE COMMUNITIES WERE MORE RESTRICTED IN AREAS OF INTENSE MANAGEMENT (BARE GROUND) THAN IN THOSE WITH COVER CROPS. WHEN HERBACEOUS COVERS EXISTED, NATURAL GROUND COVER HARBOURED A MORE DIVERSE COMMUNITY. OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT WHILE MONOSPECIFIC COVER CROPS IMPROVE THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF REPTILES, SPECIES RICHNESS DOES NOT INCREASE; HOWEVER, MORE HETEROGENEOUS HERBACEOUS GROUND COVER ( WHICH, FOR INSTANCE, CONTAIN MORE SPECIES AND ARE MORE SIMILAR TO NATURAL VEGETATION) WOULD BE A BETTER SOLUTION REGARDING THE PROMOTION OF DIVERSITY IN REPTILEASSEMBLAGES IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. FINALLY OUR RESULTS MAY BE USED TO IMPROVE THE HABITAT QUALITY OFSQUAMATE REPTILE COMMUNITIES IN SIMILAR WOODY CROPS LIKE VINEYARDS OR ORCHARDS, WHERE COVER CROPS AREBEGINNING TO BE IMPLEMENTED.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF LONG-DISTANCE TRANSLOCATION ON THE WHITE-LIPPED PIT VIPER (TRIMERESURUS ALBOLABRIS) IN SOUTH CHINA, WHERE THEY ARE ROUTINELY REMOVED FROM URBAN AREAS OR HOMES AND TRANSLOCATED INTO NATIONAL PARKS. USING RADIO TELEMETRY, WE COMPARED THE ECOLOGY AND BIOLOGY OF `RESIDENT' AND `TRANSLOCATED' SNAKES TO DETERMINE IF LONG-DISTANCE TRANSLOCATION (>3 KM) IS A VIABLE CONSERVATION OPTION. TRANSLOCATION EXTENDED THE PERIOD OVER WHICH PREDATION OCCURRED AND SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED SURVIVAL. TRANSLOCATED SNAKES MADE UNIDIRECTIONAL MOVEMENTS AWAY FROM POINTS OF RELEASE, YET THESE MOVEMENTS WERE NOT ORIENTED TOWARDS POINTS OF ORIGIN AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE FOR HOMING BEHAVIOR. TRANS LOCATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FREQUENCY OF MOVEMENTS AND DISTANCES-MOVED BY FEMALE SNAKES, BUT NO SUCH DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED FOR MALE SNAKES. IN CONTRAST WITH RESIDENT SNAKES, TRANSLOCATED SNAKES DID NOT SHOW SYNCHRONY IN THE ONSET OF BRUMATION, AND TRANSLOCATION APPEARED TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT REPRODUCTION IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LONG-DISTANCE TRANSLOCATION IS NOT THE BEST MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO HANDLE NUISANCE INDIVIDUALS OF THIS SPECIES.

WE USED SEA TURTLE TRADE IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS, WHERE TURTLES HAVE BEEN FARM RAISED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS, AS A CASE STUDY TO EXPLORE CONSUMER PREFERENCES TOWARD WILD-SOURCED (ILLEGAL) AND FARMED (LEGAL) PRODUCTS AND POTENTIAL CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS. COMBINING METHODS INNOVATIVELY (INCLUDING INDIRECT QUESTIONING AND CHOICE EXPERIMENTS), WE CONDUCTED A NATIONWIDE TRADE ASSESSMENT THROUGH IN-PERSON INTERVIEWS FROM SEPTEMBER TO DECEMBER 2014. HOUSEHOLDS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED USING DISPROPORTIONATE STRATIFIED SAMPLING, AND RESPONSES WERE WEIGHTED BASED ON DISTRICT POPULATION SIZE. WE APPROACHED 597 INDIVIDUALS, OF WHICH 37 (6.2\%) REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE. ALTHOUGH 30\% OF HOUSEHOLDS HAD CONSUMED TURTLE IN THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS, THE PURCHASE AND CONSUMPTION OF WILD PRODUCTS WAS RARE (E.G., 64-742 RESIDENT HOUSEHOLDS CONSUMED WILD TURTLE MEAT [I.E., 0.3-3.5\% OF HOUSEHOLDS] BUT REPRESENTED A LARGE THREAT TO WILD TURTLES IN THE AREA DUE TO THEIR REDUCED POPULATIONS). DIFFERENCES AMONG GROUPS OF CONSUMERS WERE MARKED, AS IDENTIFIED THROUGH CHOICE EXPERIMENTS, AND PRICE AND SOURCE OF PRODUCT PLAYED IMPORTANT ROLES IN THEIR DECISIONS. DESPITE THE LONG-TERM PRACTICE OF FARMING TURTLES, 13.5\% OF CONSUMERS SHOWED A STRONG PREFERENCE FOR WILD PRODUCTS, WHICH DEMONSTRATES THE LIMITATIONS OF WILDLIFE FARMING AS A SINGLE TOOL FOR SUSTAINABLE WILDLIFE TRADE. BY USING A COMBINATION OF INDIRECT QUESTIONING, CHOICE EXPERIMENTS, AND SALES DATA TO INVESTIGATE DEMAND FOR WILDLIFE PRODUCTS, WE OBTAINED INSIGHTS ABOUT CONSUMER BEHAVIOR THAT CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP CONSERVATION-DEMAND-FOCUSED INITIATIVES. LACK OF DATA FROM LONG-TERM SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS HINDERS THE EVALUATION OF AND LEARNING FROM WILDLIFE FARMING. THIS INFORMATION IS KEY TO UNDERSTANDING UNDER WHICH CONDITIONS DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS (E.G., BANS, WILDLIFE FARMING, SOCIAL MARKETING) ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED.",1

THE CONCEPT OF BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION RELIES PRIMARILY ON PROTECTED AREAS. YET, PROTECTED AREAS ARE INFLUENCED BY THE SURROUNDING ANTHROPOGENIC MATRIX AS DEGRADATION OF LANDSCAPES USED BY HUMANS ALSO HAS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON SPECIES WITHIN THE ADJACENT PROTECTED, NON-DEGRADED ECOSYSTEMS. INCREASING THE HETEROGENEITY OF THE ANTHROPOGENIC LANDSCAPE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROMOTE BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN PROTECTED AND NON-PROTECTED SITES. 2. TO FIND OPTIONS FOR RECONCILING LAND USE AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, WE EVALUATED REPTILE DIVERSITY OF TWO AREAS. BOTH AREAS CONTAINED THREE TYPES OF HABITAT: CULTIVATED AREAS, DEGRADED FOREST AND UNDEGRADED FOREST. IN ONE AREA (TSIM), A NETWORK OF HEDGES SURROUNDING FIELDS PROVIDED A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE RESOURCES FOR REPTILE SPECIES. ANOTHER AREA (ANDREMBA) LACKED SUCH LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS. 3. IN 480 SURVEY WALKS ON 48 TRANSECTS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED OVER TWO AREAS, WE RECORDED A TOTAL OF 24 REPTILE SPECIES, OF WHICH 18 OCCURRED IN BOTH AREAS. 4. PERENNIAL PLANT COVER EXPLAINED THE VARIATION IN LOCAL (PER TRANSECT) SPECIES RICHNESS BEST. SPECIES RICHNESS WAS LOW ALONG FIELD MARGINS IN THE CULTIVATED AREA THAT LACKED HEDGES AND HAD A PERENNIAL PLANT COVER BELOW 20\%. IT WAS HIGH IN UNDEGRADED AND DEGRADED FOREST AND ALONG HEDGES IN THE CULTIVATED AREA WHERE PERENNIAL PLANT COVER WAS ABOVE 40\%. 5. SIMILARITIES OF REPTILE ASSEMBLAGES WERE HIGHER BETWEEN HABITAT TYPES IN THE AREA STRUCTURALLY ENRICHED WITH HEDGES, THAN IN THE AREA LACKING SUCH ENRICHMENT. IN THE LATTER AREA, BETA DIVERSITY WAS LARGELY THE RESULT OF SPECIES LOSSES WHICH COULD RESULT FROM IMPEDED MOVEMENT BETWEEN HABITATS. 6. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. A CONTINUOUS NETWORK OF HEDGES AND ASSOCIATED TREES AND SHRUBS CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF REPTILE BIODIVERSITY IN DRY SOUTH-WESTERN MADAGASCAR. WHEN PRESENT, THESE INTERCONNECTED LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS ENHANCE HABITAT SUITABILITY OF THE AGRICULTURALLY USED MATRIX. THEY ALSO PROVIDE HABITAT FOR SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN. HIGH SIMILARITY BETWEEN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE AREA WITH HEDGES INDICATED THAT MOVEMENT BETWEEN HABITATS WAS FACILITATED. WE CONCLUDE THAT INCORPORATING HEDGES IN PASTURES CONTRIBUTES NOT JUST TO THE SUITABILITY OF THE MATRIX, BUT ALSO ENHANCES LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY AND THUS IMPROVES BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION IN THE HUMAN-USED LANDSCAPE.",2

FOR EACH, WE CALCULATED THE MEAN RESPONSE, VARIATION AROUND THE TARGET AND THE FREQUENCY OF UNDESIRABLE OUTCOMES WITH RESPECT TO THESE TARGETS. REGIONAL EFFECTS WERE STRONGER THAN ANY OTHER EXPLANATORY VARIABLE WE EXAMINED. AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR REGION, WE FOUND THE EFFECTS OF CATCH SHARES PRIMARILY ON CATCH-TO-QUOTA RATIOS: THESE RATIOS WERE LESS VARIABLE OVER TIME THAN IN OTHER FISHERIES. OVER-EXPLOITATION OCCURRED IN ONLY 9% OF STOCKS UNDER CATCH SHARES COMPARED TO 13% OF STOCKS UNDER FLEET-WIDE QUOTA CAPS. ADDITIONALLY, OVER-EXPLOITATION OCCURRED IN 41% OF STOCKS UNDER EFFORT CONTROLS, SUGGESTING A SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT OF QUOTA CAPS ALONE.

THIS DIVERSITY IN THE DEGREE OF HARVEST RIGHTS MAY INFLUENCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IQ FISHERIES TO MEET MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES. WE CONDUCTED A GLOBAL META-ANALYSIS OF 167 STOCKS MANAGED UNDER IQS TO TEST WHETHER THE STRENGTH OF HARVEST RIGHTS IMPACTS THE CONSERVATION STATUS OF STOCKS IN TERMS OF CATCH, EXPLOITATION RATE AND BIOMASS RELATIVE TO MANAGEMENT TARGETS. WE USED NON-PARAMETRIC METHODS TO ASSESS NON-LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS AND LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS TO EXPLICITLY CONSIDER INTERACTIONS AMONG PREDICTORS. MOST IQ FISHERIES CONSISTENTLY MET FLEET-WIDE QUOTA LIMITS (94% OF STOCKS HAD RECENT CATCHES BELOW OR WITHIN 10% OF QUOTAS), BUT ONLY 2/3 OF IQ FISHERIES ADHERED TO SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT TARGETS FOR BIOMASS AND EXPLOITATION RATE (68% OF STOCKS HAD EXPLOITATION RATES BELOW OR WITHIN 10% OF TARGETS AND 63% OF STOCKS HAD BIOMASS ABOVE OR WITHIN 10% OF BIOMASS TARGETS). STRIKINGLY, WHEN EXCLUSIVITY OF THE HARVESTING PRIVILEGE WAS LOW, EXPLOITATION RATES DEPENDED ON WHETHER IQ IMPLEMENTATION WAS INDUSTRY-DRIVEN (EXPLOITATION BELOW TARGETS) OR GOVERNMENT-MANDATED (EXPLOITATION ABOVE TARGETS). AT HIGH LEVELS OF EXCLUSIVITY, EXPLOITATION RATES CONVERGED TO JUST BELOW MANAGEMENT TARGETS. TRANSFERABILITY OF QUOTA UNITS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK BIOMASS CLOSER TO AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE TARGET LEVELS THAN STOCKS WITH NON-TRANSFERABLE QUOTA.

THESE CROPS OFTEN LACK INVERTEBRATE AND SEED RESOURCES FOR FORAGING BIRDS AND CAN BE HOSTILE NESTING ENVIRONMENTS. CEREAL-BASED WHOLECROP SILAGES (CBWCS) OFFER POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR FARMLAND BIRDS BECAUSE THEY CAN BE GROWN WITH MINIMAL HERBICIDE APPLICATIONS AND CAN BE SPRING-SOWN WITH FOLLOWING WINTER STUBBLES. WE COMPARED THE BIODIVERSITY BENEFITS AND AGRONOMIC YIELDS OF WINTER-SOWN WHEAT AND SPRING-SOWN BARLEY AS ALTERNATIVES TO GRASS AND MAIZE SILAGE IN INTENSIVE DAIRY LIVESTOCK SYSTEMS. SEED-EATING BIRDS FORAGED MAINLY IN CBWCS FIELDS DURING SUMMER, AND MAINLY ON BARLEY STUBBLES DURING WINTER AND THIS REFLECTED THE HIGHER DENSITIES OF SEED-BEARING PLANTS THEREIN. MAIZE AND GRASS FIELDS LACKED SEED-BEARING VEGETATION AND WERE STRONGLY AVOIDED BY MOST SEED-EATING BIRDS. PRODUCTION COSTS OF CBWCS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF MAIZE AND LOWER THAN THOSE OF GRASS SILAGE. SELECTIVE (RATHER THAN BROAD-SPECTRUM) HERBICIDE APPLICATION ON SPRING BARLEY CROPS INCREASED FORB COVER, REDUCED YIELDS (BY 11\%) BUT CAUSED ONLY A SMALL (<4\%) INCREASE IN PRODUCTION COSTS.

WE SUGGEST THAT IT IS RATHER DUE TO A RAPID INCREASE IN BREEDING SUCCESS, WHICH RAPIDLY INCREASED THE OBSERVED NUMBER OF BREEDERS SINCE BIRDS REMAINED IN THE AVAILABLE-FOR-COUNTING-AS-BREEDERS GROUP FOR MUCH LONGER. TWO OTHER SPECIES, THE WHITE TERN (GYGIS ALBA) AND THE BROWN BOOBY (SULA LEUCOGASTER) WERE RECORDED BREEDING IN 2014. THE FORMER SPECIES HAS NOT BRED ON THE ISLAND SINCE 1856 AND THE LATTER HAS NEVER BRED ON THE ISLAND. PLANT COVER (MONOSPECIFIC FORMATION OF THE RUDERAL HERB BOERHAVIA DIFFUSA) DRAMATICALLY INCREASED FROM LESS THAN 30\% OF SURFACE COVERAGE TO MORE THAN 70\%. ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL RESTORATION PROJECT WAS TO ERADICATE ALL INTRODUCED MAMMALS OF THE ISLAND SIMULTANEOUSLY, HOUSE MOUSE (MUS MUSCUIUS) ERADICATION FAILED. MOUSE DENSITY WAS HIGH 8 YEARS AFTER RAT ERADICATION (32 MICE/HA IN DRY SEASON AND 52 MICE/HA IN RAINY SEASON) BUT NOT HIGHER THAN AT A COMPARABLE TROPICAL ISLAND OF THE REGION (JUAN DE NOVA) WHERE MICE COEXIST WITH INTRODUCED BLACK RATS (RATTUS RATTUS) AND FERAL CATS (FELIS CATUS). THESE RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THE DIRECT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF RAT ERADICATION ON SEABIRDS AND PLANTS AND THE INDIRECT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF POST-ERADICATION SEABIRD INCREASE ON SOIL MANURING AND VEGETATION RECOVERY. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT ON TROPICAL ISLANDS, SEABIRD AND HABITAT RECOVERY CAN BE VERY RAPID AFTER RAT ERADICATION AND SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AS A RESTORATION TOOL WHEREVER POSSIBLE.

DATA ON BIRDS COLLECTED DURING THE NONBREEDING SEASON ARE PARTICULARLY LACKING. WE CAPTURED BIRDS IN MIST NETS AND RESIGHTED BANDED BIRDS TO ESTIMATE SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY, ABUNDANCE, DEMOGRAPHIC INDEXES, AND SITE-LEVEL PERSISTENCE OF PERMANENT-RESIDENT AND OVERWINTERING MIGRANTS IN REMNANT AND RESTORED RIPARIAN SITES IN CALIFORNIA. SPECIES RICHNESS IN RIPARIAN REMNANTS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN IN RESTORED SITES BECAUSE ABUNDANCES OF UNCOMMON PERMANENT RESIDENTS WERE GREATER IN REMNANTS. SPECIES RICHNESS OF OVERWINTERING MIGRANTS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN REMNANTS AND RESTORED SITES. RESPONSES AMONG OVERWINTERING MIGRANTS (BUT NOT PERMANENT RESIDENTS) TO REMNANT AND RESTORED RIPARIAN SITES DIFFERED. CAPTURE RATES WERE HIGHER IN REMNANT OR RESTORED RIPARIAN SITES FOR 7 OF 10 OVERWINTERING MIGRATORY SPECIES. FOR LINCOLN'S SPARROWS (MELOSPIZA LINCOLNII) AND WHITE-CROWNED SPARROWS (ZONOTRICHIA LEUCOPHRYS) PROPORTIONS OF OLDER BIRDS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN REMNANTS, EVEN THOUGH CAPTURE RATES OF THESE SPECIES WERE HIGHER IN RESTORED SITES. OVERWINTER PERSISTENCE OF 4 MIGRANT SPECIES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN REMNANT THAN IN RESTORED SITES. A HIGHER PROPORTION OF HERMIT THRUSHES (CATHARUS GUTTATUS, 56.3\%), OLDER FOX SPARROWS (PASSERELLA ILIACA, 57.1\%), LINCOLN'S SPARROWS (59.7\%), AND WHITE-CROWNED SPARROWS (67.8\%) PERSISTED IN REMNANTS THAN RESTORED SITES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST RESTORED RIPARIAN SITES PROVIDE HABITAT FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIES IN COMPARABLE ABUNDANCES AND DIVERSITY AS OCCURS IN REMNANT RIPARIAN SITES.

WE STUDIED BIRD COMMUNITY RECOVERY FOR 9 YEARS (2001-2009) DURING LANDSCAPE RESTORATION AND GUADIAMAR GREEN CORRIDOR ESTABLISHMENT IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE AZNALCÓLLAR MINE SPILL (SW SPAIN, 1998). ONE YEAR FOLLOWING PLANT RESTORATION (3 YEARS AFTER THE SPILL), VALUES FOR Α- AND Β-BIRD SPECIES DIVERSITY WERE HIGH, SOONER THAN REPORTED FOR SIMILAR RESTORATION PROCESSES ELSEWHERE. SPECIES RICHNESS, ECOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, AND ABUNDANCE INCREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY IN THE FOLLOWING 8 YEARS. OVERLAP BETWEEN COMMUNITIES IN SEQUENTIAL YEARS, MEASURED BY SIMILARITY INDEXES, INCREASED THROUGHOUT THE STUDY PERIOD TO ABOUT 70% DURING FINAL SURVEY YEARS, AND MOST BREEDING BIRD SPECIES PRESENT BEFORE THE ACCIDENT AGAIN INHABIT THE AREA. ONLY 5 YEARS AFTER THE MINE ACCIDENT, BIRD COMMUNITIES IN THE RESTORED SITE WERE SIMILAR IN SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE, AND DIVERSITY TO AN UNAFFECTED REFERENCE SITE; REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT BIRD COMMUNITIES WERE ALSO SIMILAR BETWEEN THE REFERENCE RIVER AND THE GUADIAMAR. DESPITE THE SEVERITY OF THE MINE ACCIDENT, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST A SWIFT RECOVERY OF THE BIRD COMMUNITY. WE ATTRIBUTE THIS SUCCESS TO THE RAPID RESTORATION OF HABITAT AVAILABILITY AND THE RESILIENCE OF THE BIRDS.

TWO VINEYARDS HAD A HERBACEOUS COVER PLANTED BETWEEN CROP ROWS TO PREVENT SOIL EROSION. IN ONE VINEYARD THESE HERBACEOUS COVER CORRIDORS WERE CHEMICALLY MANAGED TO PREVENT COMPETITION BETWEEN THE HERB COVER AND THE CROP, WHEREAS IN A SECOND THE HERBACEOUS COVER WAS SUBJECT TO MECHANICAL MANAGEMENT THROUGH SOME CLEARING, CROP COVERAGE, AND HEIGHT CHECKS. A THIRD VINEYARD WAS UNDER CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT (BARE SOIL AND SOIL TILLAGE) AND SERVED AS A CONTROL. WE COMPARED LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND METRICS, AND PASSERINE SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE, AND DIVERSITY BETWEEN THE THREE VINEYARDS.RESULTS OVERALL BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY, AS WELL AS ABUNDANCE OF INSECTIVOROUS PASSERINE BIRDS WERE HIGHEST IN THE MECHANICALLY MANAGED VINEYARD. THE CHEMICALLY MANAGED VINEYARD HAD LOWER SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE IN COMPARISON TO THE MECHANICALLY MANAGED VINEYARD. IN CONTRAST, THE CONVENTIONALLY MANAGED PLOT HAD THE LOWEST BIRD DIVERSITY, ABUNDANCE, AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF ALL THREE PLOTS. LANDSCAPE DIVERSITY WAS SIMILAR ACROSS THE THREE VINEYARDS.CONCLUSION ALTHOUGH OUR FINDINGS ARE PRELIMINARY AND MORE RESEARCH AND REPLICATIONS ARE NEEDED, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT MECHANICALLY MANAGED HERBACEOUS COVER CORRIDORS IN VINEYARDS, HAVE POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THE RESIDENT BIRD COMMUNITIES. © 2014 BRITISH TRUST FOR ORNITHOLOGY.",NA

HOWEVER, AT NONIRRIGATED MARSHES FED BY NATURAL SPRINGS AND STREAMS, GRAZED SITES HAD LOWER OCCUPANCY THAN UNGRAZED SITES. BLACK RAIL OCCUPANCY WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MARSH AREA, IRRIGATION AS A WATER SOURCE, AND SUMMER VEGETATION COVER, AND NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MARSH ISOLATION.
