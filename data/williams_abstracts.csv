M.",New Zealand Journal of Zoology,2011,NA,2,Threatening mechanism,0,No response,NA,NA,NA,"Many albatross populations are declining and a major cause is believed to be incidental mortality from fishing. We investigated the effect of fishing on southern Buller's albatross Thalassarche bulleri bulleri, using a new approach to seabird population modelling that allows estimation of demographic parameters from multiple data types. Three types of data were used: a 60-year set of mark-recapture observations, four censuses of the breeding population, and estimates of fishing effort and bycatch. The fisheries risk to the viability of this population over the last 60 years appears to have been small, since the adult population is estimated to have increased about fivefold over that time. There is some cause for concern in recent changes (population growth has slowed, and perhaps reversed, and adult survival rates are falling). The most common age at first breeding was 12 years, and about 80% of adults breed each year. Annual survival was estimated to bc 0.91 for juveniles, and varied between this value and 1 for adults. Though this population is not in immediate danger from fishing, there is a need for continued monitoring to see whether the recent fall in survival rates persists and causes a decline in abundance. Our analysis showed that when, as is common, mark-recapture data do not provide good estimates of all demographic rates, the assessment of seabird population trends can be improved by the use of other types of data, particularly abundance. © 2012 The Royal Society of New Zealand.",Modelling the effect of fishing on southern Buller's albatross using a 60-year dataset,New Zealand Journal of Zoology,10.1080/03014223.2011.600766

With a total of 135 vessels, the fleet is one of the largest in Argentina. Specifically tasked seabird observers were placed onboard trawlers during the summer and winter seasons of the years 2006 and 2007. The type and number of seabird interactions (i.e. contacts with fishing gear) were recorded during shooting and hauling operations, covering 72days of observation and 328 trawls. Black-browed albatrosses, white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis, southern giant petrels Marconectes giganteus and southern royal albatrosses Diomedea epomophora were the most abundant species interacting with trawlers. Confirmed mortalities of black-browed and southern royal albatrosses were the result of collisions and entanglement with the warp cable while birds were scavenging. The estimated total mortality rate was 0.017 birds h-1 and 0.105 birds per vessel per day. The intensity of interactions (in terms of the number of contacts per unit time) was largely explained by the distribution of the fishing effort. Seasonality and the incidence of discards were the strongest factors explaining the occurrence of seabird interactions. The total annual mortality in the trawl fleet under investigation was roughly estimated to be from several hundred to over a thousand albatrosses. However, these figures should be considered preliminary due to the limited spatial and temporal coverage of data and the fact that estimations were based on a low number of observed mortalities. The implementation of a strategic discard management may significantly reduce the number of seabird mortalities from collisions with warp cables or improve the effectiveness of other complementary mitigation methods. Urgent implementation of mitigation measures is needed in this fleet to reduce the mortality of albatrosses and petrels along the Patagonian shelf. © 2010 The Authors.

We reviewed the extent of seabird bycatch in all longline fisheries for which data are available. Despite the many inadequacies and assumptions contained therein, we estimated that at least 160 000 (and potentially in excess of 320 000) seabirds are killed annually. Most frequently caught are albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters, with current levels of mortality liable to be unsustainable for some species and popula- tions. Where realistic comparisons can be made, with data from the 1990s, there is evidence of sub- stantially reduced bycatch in some key fisheries. Reductions stem from decreased fishing effort (especially in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean), and greater and more effective use of technical mitigation measures, notably in demersal fisheries. However, bycatch problems in other fisheries have also emerged. Current concerns include those with previously unidentified bycatch problems (e.g. Spanish Gran Sol demersal fleet) and those where bycatch was identified, but where persistent data gaps prevented adequate assessments of the scale of the impact (e.g. Nordic demersal fisheries). Future assessments will only achieve greater precision when mini- mum standards of data collection, reporting and analysis are implemented by longline fishing fleets and the relevant regional fishery management organisations. Those fisheries in which bycatch has been substantially reduced demonstrate that the problem of seabird bycatch could be reduced to negligible proportions by enforced implementation of appropriate best-practice mitigation devices and techniques. © Inter-Research 2011.",Global seabird bycatch in longline fisheries,Endangered Species Research,10.3354/esr00347

However, relatively few studies have examined the impacts of distant water longline fishing on the high seas due to the difficulty associated with deploying observers. Our study addresses this data gap by analyzing data from 2666 Taiwanese scientific observation data sets from 2002 to 2007 to calculate the seabird bycatch rate and to estimate the mortality of seabirds as a result of fishing activities by the entire fleet. A total of 379 seabirds were caught and 88% were albatross. A negative binomial distribution was used to represent the observed data based on spatial and temporal stratification, which yielded bycatch rates that ranged from 0.0003 to 0.2213 birds per 1000 hooks. The bycatch rates were highest in the areas between 25-45°N and 165°E-160°W between October and March and the areas between 25-35°S and 170°E-165°W between April and September. Using the observed data for bycatch rates and total fishing effort, the estimated number of seabird deaths caused by the Taiwanese fleet ranged from 1120 to 4290 birds annually. Increasing the observer coverage of specific fleets and areas, prioritizing observer programs and combined with international cooperation in research, would improve bycatch calculations.

However, little is known about the nature and the spatial-temporal extent of the interactions between individual birds and vessels. By studying a system in which we had fine-scale data on bird movements and activity, and near real-time information on vessel distribution, we provide new insights on the association of a threatened albatross with fisheries. During early chick-rearing, black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophris from two different colonies (separated by only 75 km) showed significant differences in the degree of association with fisheries, despite being nearly equidistant to the Falklands fishing fleet. Most foraging trips from either colony did not bring tracked individuals close to vessels, and proportionally little time and foraging effort was spent near ships. Nevertheless, a few individuals repeatedly visited fishing vessels, which may indicate they specialise on fisheries-linked food sources and so are potentially more vulnerable to bycatch. The evidence suggests that this population has little reliance on fisheries discards at a critical stage of its nesting cycle, and hence measures to limit fisheries waste on the Patagonian shelf that also reduce vessel attractiveness and the risk of incidental mortality, would be of high overall conservation benefit. © 2011 Granadeiro et al.",Albatrosses following fishing vessels: How badly hooked are they on an easy meal?,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0017467

This applies particularly to the area of the continental slope, due to the high rates of incidental catch from pelagic longliners. We analyzed the temporal variation in the seabird assemblage associated with this fishery, identified the species that make use of discards, and evaluated their interactions while foraging. During 20 commercial fishing trips between 2005 and 2008, we completed 415 bird counts and recorded behavior in 172 of these. The observed species richness (=38 species) is greater than that reported for any other fishery in the region and was highest from October to April, although many species in the assemblage were significantly more abundant between May and September. Only 14 species made significant use of discards, and all of these were albatrosses and petrels captured incidentally. We observed within- and between-species competition for access to discards. In general, the frequency of intraspecific competition was greater in the most abundant species, during the period of their greatest abundance. Albatrosses were more successful in interspecific competitive interactions, and we observed a dominance hierarchy related to body size. We conclude that the composition and seasonality of the seabird bycatch is determined by the spatiotemporal dynamics of the assemblage and by the observed pattern of interspecific interactions. Discards from pelagic longline fleets operating in the BMC may be an important food source for at least 8 species of globally threatened seabirds. Understanding the effect of discards on these populations could generate useful information for conservation, although reducing bycatch levels should be considered the main goal. © Inter-Research 2011.",Structure of the seabird assemblage associated with pelagic longline vessels in the Southwestern Atlantic: Implications for bycatch,Endangered Species Research,10.3354/esr00378

J",Emu,2012,NA,2,Threatening mechanism,4,Testing response,NA,NA,NA,"By-catch of seabirds on trawl-fishing gear has been reported worldwide, and is exacerbated by the discharge of fisheries waste. We compared the attraction of seabirds to three forms of fishery waste unprocessed discharge (offal, fish discards), hashed discharge (smaller chunks passed through a hasher pump) and cutter pump discharge (waste passed through the hasher and a cutter pump to further reduce particle size) to identify the discharge form that most effectively reduced the risk of seabird by-catch. Seabird responses measured within specified areas astern of the vessel were the abundance of: large albatrosses (Diomedea spp.), small albatrosses and giant-petrels (Thalassarche spp.; Southern Giant-Petrels, Macronectes giganteus; and Northern Giant-Petrels, M. halli), Cape Petrels (Daption capense) and all other procellariid species. Seabirds on the water were less numerous during cutter pump and hashed discharge relative to unprocessed discharge (except small albatrosses cutter treatment). Also, in some cases, the total number of birds decreased, relative to unprocessed discharge treatments (but not small and large albatrosses cutter treatment). Particle size may be less important for reducing abundances than temporal discharge patterns, which affected how birds tracked the discharge stream. Manipulating discharge characteristics can reduce seabird attraction to fishing vessels. However, the risk of by-catch remained lowest when no discharging occurred. © 2012 BirdLife Australia.",Reducing effects of trawl fishing on seabirds by limiting foraging opportunities provided by fishery waste,Emu,10.1071/MU12002

While there are various types of evidence of a strong impact of longline fisheries on seabirds, in particular albatrosses, the incidental bycatch mortality has never been directly linked to estimates of bycatch derived from on-board surveys. We develop a capture-recapture analysis which relates the annual probability of survival in the Black-Footed Albatross to the estimated absolute bycatch. By converting the absolute bycatch into an estimate relative to population size and using the theory of exploited populations, we show that survival probability decreases linearly with bycatch, and that the bycatch is underestimated by at least 50%, confirming suspicions based on reviews of the bycatch survey procedures, and raising further concerns about the impact of longline fisheries on seabirds.

Analysis of data from the US National Marine Fisheries Service Pelagic Observer Program (POP ) revealed a significant hook effect on seabird bycatch. Our analysis focused on the three areas with highest seabird bycatch, the northeast US coast (60°W-71°W, 35°N-42°N), the Middle Atlantic Bight (71°W-82°W, 35°N-41°N), and the South Atlantic Bight (71°W-82°W, 30°N-35°N). We developed two generalized linear models to examine effects of four hook treatments, i.e., four combinations of hook type and size (8/0 J-hook, 9/0 J-hook, 16/0 circle hook, and 18/0 circle hook), on: (1) the probability of catching seabirds on a set and (2) the positive catch rate (i.e., number of seabirds per 1000 hooks in longline sets with at least one seabird caught). Results indicated that combinations of hook type and size significantly influenced the probability of catching seabirds in the United States Atlantic pelagic longline fishery. Use of the 8/0 J-hook led to the highest probability of catching a seabird. Use of circle hooks may significantly reduce seabird bycatch in the US Atlantic pelagic longline fishery, but its effectiveness may be confounded by other factors such as bait type, fishing location, season, and target species.

261,Bycatch,Bycatch susceptibility in pelagic longline fisheries: are albatrosses affected by the diving behaviour of medium_sized petrels,"Jimnez, S., Domingo, A., Abreau, M., Brazeiro, A.",AQUATIC CONSERVATION: MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,2012,NA,2,Threatening mechanism,0,No response,NA,NA,NA,"Species of petrels and shearwaters with high diving ability could facilitate the catch of albatrosses in pelagic longline fisheries, because they retrieve bait to the surface from depths that albatrosses cannot reach. Once on the surface, large seabirds such as albatrosses can easily displace smaller species thus gaining access to baited hooks which increases their likelihood of getting caught. This paper evaluates the extent to which diving species (i.e. Procellaria aequinoctialis, Procellaria conspicillata and Puffinus gravis) increase the susceptibility of albatross to bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries. In 48 sets, attacks on baits were quantified. When more than one bird (of the same or different species) tried to attack the same bait this was defined as a multiple attack. There were 384 attacks on baits, of which 260 were made by a single individual and 124 by more than one. Multiple attacks were the largest source of bycatch of albatrosses (22 of 27 albatrosses whose attacks were observed). Of the baits attacked by albatrosses (n=244), 17% were indirectly facilitated by diving medium-sized petrels. Considering only the multiple attacks in which albatrosses participated (n=114), 36% were initiated by these medium-sized petrels. Eleven (41%) of the albatrosses captured, and whose attacks were observed, resulted from a diving medium-sized seabird species first having contacted the terminal tackle. This paper shows that medium-sized petrels, with a strong ability to dive, increase considerably the access to bait, and indirectly, the incidental bycatch of albatrosses. Observations made in the absence of mitigation measures also provide useful information to improve the performance of tori lines. Based on the seabird behaviour, it is recommended that tori lines should have a minimum aerial coverage of 50 m. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd..",Bycatch susceptibility in pelagic longline fisheries: Are albatrosses affected by the diving behaviour of medium-sized petrels?,Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems,10.1002/aqc.2242

In this study, we analyze fishing effort and catch data of the Taiwanese distant-water longline tuna fleet - the largest fleet in the Atlantic Ocean. These data collected by fishery observers over a 5-year span include 61 trips involving 6181 observed sets of over 20 million hooks, where 198 seabirds were caught (23 of which were released alive). Most birds were caught in the South Atlantic, with estimated seabird bycatch rates ranging from 0.026 birds per thousand hooks in the southwest Atlantic to 0.063 birds per thousand hooks in the southeast Atlantic. Black-browed, Atlantic yellow-nosed, and wandering albatrosses, as well as spectacled and southern giant petrels, were the most frequently caught species. Seabird bycatch hotspots were identified at 20°-40°S/10°W-15°E and 35°-45°S/45°-55°W. In the South Atlantic Ocean, generalized additive models indicated that fishing location and the number of birds sighted significantly influenced seabird bycatch rates. Extrapolating these spatially and temporally explicit seabird bycatch rates to the fishing effort data of other distant-water longline fleets and extrapolating the bycatch rates reported in the literature to the reported fishing effort of coastal nation fleets, we estimate the total seabird incidental mortality from pelagic longline fishing in the southern Atlantic Ocean to be between 3446 and 6083 birds per year from 2004 to 2008.

However, the relative impact of fisheries on all the affected populations or species still remains poorly understood. This paper applied a Productivity and Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) and the concept of ""Potential Biological Removal Level"" (PBR) to assess the relative impact caused by the Uruguayan pelagic longline fishery on several populations. This two-step approach allowed us to obtain an objective view of the relative impact of the Uruguayan pelagic longline fleet on most of the populations or species of albatrosses and petrels with high association with this fishery. Of fifteen species considered, fourteen were finally assessed and a ranking of risk derived. The concept of PBR was applied to the nine most at-risk species. The impact of fishing on populations could not be straightforwardly inferred from their bycatch rates. Results indicate that large albatrosses (Diomedea spp.) and Thalassarche chlororhynchos are more affected than some of the main species caught by the fishery (i.e. Thalassarche melanophrys and Procellaria aequinoctialis). Diomedea exulans from South Georgia is likely to be the population most affected by the Uruguayan fleet. This work should be seen as a case study of the fisheries operating in the southwestern Atlantic. The Uruguayan fleet within its operation area was responsible for only the 4.3% to 12.5% of the total annual effort deployed by the different fleets during 2004-2008. The combined impact of these fleets could be sufficiently high to account for many of the observed declines in the populations of D. exulans, D. dabbenena and T. chlororhynchos.

In many cases this is due to safety concerns caused by traditional leaded swivels causing serious injuries, and even fatalities, when they fly-back at the crew in the event of line breakage (e.g. from shark bite offs) during line hauling. This paper presents the results of at-sea and on-shore trials to test the safety and operational effectiveness of an alternative line weight (the Safe Lead) which is designed to slide down, or off the line, in the event of a bite-off, significantly reducing danger to the crew from line weights. At-sea trials in South Africa revealed that Safe Leads can reduce the incidence of dangerous fly-backs to very low levels. In at-sea trails, only 4.2% of Safe Lead fly-backs reached the vessel (the remainder fell in the sea) whereas 73.3% of fly-backs by leaded swivels hit the vessel and one hit a crewmen in the head. Simulated bite-off events on shore revealed the degree of slippage (influences whether leads slide but remain on the branch line, or slide off the end of the line) varied as a function of distance from Safe Lead to hook (1-4. m range) and tension on the line (20-120 kg range). All Safe Lead replicates placed within 2. m of the hook slid off the line under all four tension treatments. Under the higher tension categories of 80 kg and 120 kg, 80% of Safe Leads positioned 3. m from the hook position slid off the line after a simulated bite-off (cut-away). High speed photography of fly-backs showed a significant (P<0.05) reduction in the velocity on impact of Safe Leads compared to leaded swivels and an associated >80% reduction in kinetic energy on impact.

We also added weight to a subset of branch lines, and compared the effects of line weighting and night vs. day setting in combination with bird-scaring lines on bird and fish catch rates. White-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis), a diving seabird, dominated the seabird assemblage; they were the most numerous seabird and they attacked baited hooks and were killed at the highest rates. Secondary attacks - surface foraging albatrosses stealing baits from white-chinned petrels - drove albatross mortality. With hybrid scaring lines deployed, both diving and surface foraging seabirds made fewer attacks (1.5 and 2 times, respectively) within the lines' 100. m aerial extent, where hooks are closest to the surface and birds are most vulnerable to hooking, than with light lines. However, all metrics of comparison between hybrid and light lines were not statistically conclusive, primarily because birds could access baited hooks in areas beyond the protection afforded by bird-scaring lines (aft and to port of their aerial extent). Seabird bycatch rates were 4.6 times higher during daylight hours (2.00 birds/1000 hooks; 52 birds) than at night (0.439 birds/1000 hooks; 28 birds) and night catch rates near the full moon doubled. Bird catch rates were 18 times higher on unweighted branch lines (1.07/1000 hooks; 79 birds) than on weighted branch lines (0.06/1000 hooks; 1 bird) with no detectable effect on fish catch. With respect to streamer lines, our results suggest that in Procellaria petrel dominated systems the aerial extent of bird-scaring lines (of any design) should span the distance that baited hooks are within 10. m of the surface to effectively prevent bird attacks on baits. Overall, results suggest that night setting, adequate branch line weighting, and proper deployment of two bird-scaring lines have the potential to reduce seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries without reducing the catch rates of target fishes. Further development of safe, fast-sinking branch line weighting configurations and bird-scaring lines less prone to tangling on fishing gear is critical to this effort. © 2013.","Reducing seabird bycatch in the South African joint venture tuna fishery using bird-scaring lines, branch line weighting and nighttime setting of hooks",Fisheries Research,10.1016/j.fishres.2013.04.015

Detailed observations of seabird species abundance and attacks on baits were conducted from a longliner operating in the western North Pacific from December 2010 to January 2011. Line settings alternated between ST and PT deployments. About 90% of the seabirds attending the vessel were Laysan albatrosses (Phoebastria immutabilis), and most attacks were by this species. Attacks occurred across broad areas from 25 to 200. m of the stern during ST deployments, whereas PT deployment resulted in few attacks within 75. m of the stern. The number of secondary attacks (birds charging for the bait brought to the surface by the bird making the primary attack) was significantly lower during PT than during ST deployment. These results suggest that PT performed better than ST in reducing bait attacks, and consequently seabird mortality. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Comparison of the effectiveness of paired and single tori lines for preventing bait attacks by seabirds and their bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries,Fisheries Research,10.1016/j.fishres.2012.11.007

Bycatch - the accidental catch of non-target species - spans the spectrum of marine fauna and constitutes a harvesting pressure. Individual differences in attraction to fishing vessels and consequent susceptibility to bycatch exist, but few studies integrate this individual heterogeneity with demography. Here, we tested for the evidence and consequences of individual heterogeneity on the demography of the wandering albatross, a seabird heavily affected by fisheries bycatch. We found strong evidence for heterogeneity in survival with one group of individuals having a 5.2% lower annual survival probability than another group, and a decrease in the proportion of those individuals with the lowest survival in the population coinciding with a 7.5 fold increase in fishing effort in the foraging areas. Potential causes for the heterogeneity in survival are discussed and we suggest that bycatch removed a large proportion of individuals attracted by fishing vessels and had significant phenotypic and population consequences. © 2013 Barbraud et al.",Fisheries Bycatch as an Inadvertent Human-Induced Evolutionary Mechanism,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0060353

A common approach to quantifying the extent of interactions is to overlay density maps of seabird and fishing activities derived from point locations. Such large-scale evaluations of overlap can be misleading due to the static representation of birds and vessels that in reality are spatially and temporally dynamic. Additionally, overlap at large scales does not necessarily indicate interaction; overlapping distributions of seabirds and fisheries could reflect coincident use of habitat. Using 4 yr of distribution data, we conducted a fine-scale analysis of overlap between albatrosses and fishing vessels. Results were compared to those derived from large-scale density comparisons. Additionally, we compared overlap versus interaction rates by calculating the proportion of time that birds foraged in close association with a fishing vessel versus independently while within 10 km of a vessel. Results of our fine-scale analysis indicated generally low rates of overlap while foraging and high variability among sexes, years and types of fishery. Changes in overlap rates were attributed to shifts in both albatross and vessel distributions. Albatrosses foraged independently of fishing vessels half the time they were within 10 km of a vessel, indicating that 50% of overlap is due to coincident habitat use rather than vessel interaction. Overlaying of large-scale distribution maps failed to distinguish annual variation in the degree of bird-fishery overlap, and suggested overlap where none was identified at the finer scale. This study illustrates the increased insight derived from fine-scale analyses of seabird-fisheries interactions. © Inter-Research 2013.",Scaling down the analysis of seabird-fishery interactions,Marine Ecology Progress Series,10.3354/meps10071

Maximum dive depth (16 m) was slightly deeper than the previous estimate (13 m), but varied considerably among individuals (range 2-16 m). Males dived deeper than females, and birds feeding chicks dived deeper than incubating birds, but dive rate did not differ between the sexes.

Identification of the principal factors that determine this by-catch and understanding how they could be controlled is fundamental for improving the management of fisheries and so carry out a better conservation of Cory's shearwater populations in the Mediterranean. The aim of this paper was to model the longline by-catch of Mediterranean Cory's shearwater in the Spanish Mediterranean longline fishery as a function of time of the year, technical characteristics of the fishing operation, and geographical location. We used data recorded by an onboard observer program monitoring commercial longline fisheries. During the 10 years covered in this study, 80 birds were captured in 30 fishing operations out of a total of 2,587 observed fishing sets. We used favourability functions and Random Forest analyses to relate the presence of Cory's shearwater in the by-catch with the explanatory factors. The most explanatory factor in relation to incidence of by-catch was the geographical location (longitude and fishing over the continental shelf) and then the technical characteristics of the fishing operation (number of hooks and fishing during non-working days). Our conclusion is clear, because seabirds are more likely to approach longline vessels when trawlers are not allowed to operate (i.e. non-working days), activity of longliners should be limited to working days, and closing longliners activity during the month of October could reduce greatly reducing seabird bycatch. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Cory's shearwater by-catch in the Mediterranean Spanish commercial longline fishery: Implications for management,Biodiversity and Conservation,10.1007/s10531-014-0625-6

The Hawaii longline swordfish fishery reduced seabird captures by an order of magnitude primarily through mitigating bycatch during setting. Now, 75% of captures occur during hauling. We fit observer data to a generalized additive regression model with mixed effects to determine the significance of the effect of various factors on the standardized seabird haul catch rate. Density of albatrosses attending vessels during hauling, leader length and year had largest model effects. The standardized haul catch rate significantly increased with increased albatross density during hauling. The standardized catch rate was significantly higher the longer the leader: shorter leaders place weighted swivels closer to hooks, reducing the likelihood of baited hooks becoming available to surface-scavenging albatrosses. There was a significant linear increasing temporal trend in the standardized catch rate, possibly partly due to an observed increasing temporal trend in the local abundance of albatrosses attending vessels during hauling. Swivel weight, Beaufort scale and season were also significant but smaller model effects. Most (81%) haul captures were on branchlines actively being retrieved. Future haul mitigation research should therefore focus on reducing bird access to hooks as crew coil branchlines, including methods identified here of shorter leaders and heavier swivels, and other potentially effective methods, including faster branchline coiling and shielding the area where hooks becomes accessible. The proportion of Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) captures that occurred during hauling was significantly, 1.6 times, higher than for black-footed albatrosses (P. nigripes), perhaps due to differences in the time of day of foraging and in daytime scavenging competitiveness; mitigating haul bycatch would therefore be a larger benefit to Laysans. Locally, findings identify opportunities to nearly eliminate seabird bycatch.

Multiple measures were used to compare the performance of weighted vs. unweighted branch lines set with two bird-scaring lines - hybrid lines with long and short streamers - during daytime and nighttime. The weights used were a novel double-weight configuration. Secondary attacks on baits brought to the surface by white-chinned petrels drove albatross mortality. Regardless of time of day, weighted branch lines with two bird-scaring lines, deployed and maintained with an aerial extent of 100. m, reduced bird attacks by a factor of four, and secondary attacks and seabird mortality by a factor of seven, compared to unweighted branch lines, with little effect on fish catch rates and with no injuries to crew. This combination yielded zero bird mortalities when gear was set at night. We conclude that the simultaneous use of two bird-scaring lines, weighted branch lines and night setting meet our criteria for best-practice seabird bycatch mitigation for the joint-venture fleet targeting tuna and related species in the South African EEZ. To be successful, the aerial extent of bird-scaring lines should be aligned with the distance astern that baited hooks sink beyond the foraging depth of the dominant seabird - in this case white-chinned petrels to a depth near 5. m. Given that these measures were successful in one of the most challenging pelagic longline fisheries, they are likely to be widely applicable to pelagic longline fisheries using similar gear. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Best practice seabird bycatch mitigation for pelagic longline fisheries targeting tuna and related species,Fisheries Research,10.1016/j.fishres.2013.07.012

Recent research suggests that fishing effort is increasing worldwide, highlighting the need to evaluate strategies intended to reduce marine megafauna bycatch. Here, we use three focal species (i.e. leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea, black-footed albatross Phoebastria nigripes and vaquita porpoise Phocoena sinus) as case studies to compare management outcomes of four bycatch mitigation measures: time-area closures, individual bycatch limits, gear modifications and buy-outs. Time-area closures were used for leatherbacks and vaquitas with limited effectiveness, although timing, size and enforcement influenced their efficacy. Individual bycatch limits were employed for leatherbacks in one fishery, sometimes simultaneously with gear modifications and closures. Gear modifications consistently reduced bycatch of leatherbacks and black-footed albatross and showed strong promise for vaquitas. True buy-outs were only used for vaquitas and were costly, most fishers were unwilling to be bought out, and it is unclear if they reduced bycatch. Our review suggests that gear modifications were the most widely used and generally most promising technique for these species, although management outcomes of each strategy depended largely on the species-fishery interaction, fishery characteristics and socioeconomic context.

We fill this knowledge gap and present a synoptic global assessment of the distribution and intensity of bycatch of seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles based on empirical data from the three most commonly used types of fishing gears worldwide. We identify taxa-specific hotspots of bycatch intensity and find evidence of cumulative impacts across fishing fleets and gears. This global map of bycatch illustrates where data are particularly scarce-in coastal and small-scale fisheries and ocean regions that support developed industrial fisheries and millions of small-scale fishers-and identifies fishing areas where, given the evidence of cumulative hotspots across gear and taxa, traditional species or gear-specific bycatch management and mitigation efforts may be necessary but not sufficient. Given the global distribution of bycatch and the mitigation success achieved by some fleets, the reduction of air-breathing megafauna bycatch is both an urgent and achievable conservation priority.","Global patterns of marine mammal, seabird, and sea turtle bycatch reveal taxa-specific and cumulative megafauna hotspots",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.1318960111

Eleven tags were deployed on albatrosses during the non-breeding seasons 2011 and 2012 in the Patagonian Shelf. Their distribution overlapped to different extents with the two coastal trawl, three offshore trawl and one demersal longline fisheries. The overlap index showed highest values with both coastal fleets, followed by the ice-chilling trawl fleet. These intersections were located in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone, in coastal areas of the SE of Buenos Aires province, El Rincón estuary and over the shelf break. The analysis of intersections of focal areas from albatrosses and all fisheries allowed the identification of thirty-four fishing management units (1° by 1° grid within the Argentine EEZ) classified as of medium, high or very high conservation priority. Very high priority units were placed between 35 and 38°S in the external mouth of Rio de la Plata, and between 45 and 47°S in neighboring waters East to the hake fishing closure.

Twelve different classes of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were purchased from 176 pharmacies. Other than meloxicam (of negligible toxicity to vultures at likely concentrations in their food), diclofenac and ketoprofen (both toxic to vultures), little is known of the safety or toxicity of the remaining nine NSAIDs on sale. Meloxicam was the most commonly encountered drug, sold in 70% of pharmacies, but 50% of the meloxicam brands sold had paracetamol (acetaminophen) as a second ingredient. Diclofenac and ketoprofen were recorded in 36 and 29% of pharmacies, respectively, with states in western and central India having the highest prevalence of diclofenac (44-45%). Although the large number of manufacturers and availability of meloxicam is encouraging, the wide range of untested NSAIDs and continued availability of diclofenac is a major source of concern. Circumvention of the 2006 diclofenac ban is being achieved by illegally selling forms of diclofenac manufactured for human use for veterinary purposes.

We analyse data from three surveys of the prevalence and concentration of diclofenac residues in carcasses of domesticated ungulates in India, carried out before and after the implementation of a ban on veterinary use. There was little change in the prevalence and concentration of diclofenac between a survey before the ban and one conducted soon after its implementation, with the percentage of carcasses containing diclofenac in these surveys estimated at 10.8 and 10.7%, respectively. However, both the prevalence and concentration of diclofenac had fallen markedly 7-31 months after the implementation of the ban, with the true prevalence in this third survey estimated at 6.5%. Modelling of the impact of this reduction in diclofenac on the expected rate of decline of the oriental white-backed vulture (Gyps bengalensis) in India indicates that the decline rate has decreased to 40% of the rate before the ban, but is still likely to be rapid (about 18% year-1).

The breeding programme is most advanced at the BNHS centres, and has already achieved successful breeding of all three species at the centre in Pinjore, Haryana. Artificial incubation techniques have also been developed at the Pinjore centre, with successful rearing, and most recently, allowing some pairs to double productivity by producing two nestlings to fledging within a season, despite the vultures' normal habit of laying one clutch per year. The total number of birds held in all centres combined for all three species combined is 270 in India, with a further 60 in Nepal, and 20 in Pakistan. The Central Zoo Authority supported centres hold additional birds to those held in India. © Bombay Natural History Society 2012.",Conservation breeding for the future release of the critically endangered Asian gyps vultures - progress of the programme in south Asia and why it is so important,NA,NA

Surveys in India, initially conducted in 1991-1993 and repeated in 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2007, revealed that the population of Gyps bengalensis had fallen by 2007 to 0.1% of its numbers in the early 1990s, with the population of Gyps indicus and G. tenuirostris combined having fallen to 3.2% of its earlier level. A survey of G. bengalensis in western Nepal indicated that the size of the population in 2009 was 25% of that in 2002. In this paper, repeat surveys conducted in 2011 were analysed to estimate recent population trends. Populations of all three species of vulture remained at a low level, but the decline had slowed and may even have reversed for G. bengalensis, both in India and Nepal. However, estimates of the most recent population trends are imprecise, so it is possible that declines may be continuing, though at a significantly slower rate. The degree to which the decline of G. bengalensis in India has slowed is consistent with the expected effects on population trend of a measured change in the level of contamination of ungulate carcasses with the drug diclofenac, which is toxic to vultures, following a ban on its veterinary use in 2006. The most recent available information indicates that the elimination of diclofenac from the vultures' food supply is incomplete, so further efforts are required to fully implement the ban. © 2012 Prakash et al.",The Population Decline of Gyps Vultures in India and Nepal Has Slowed since Veterinary Use of Diclofenac was Banned,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0049118

Cambodia supports one of the only populations of three species (White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis, Slender-billed Vulture G. tenuirostris and Red-headed Vulture Sarcogyps calvus) outside of South Asia where diclofenac use is not widespread. Conservation of the Cambodian sub-populations is therefore a global priority. This study analyses the results of a long-term research programme into Cambodian vultures that was initiated in 2004. Population sizes of each species are estimated at 50-200+ individuals, ranging across an area of approximately 300 km by 250 km, including adjacent areas in Laos and Vietnam. The principal causes of vulture mortality were poisoning (73%), probably as an accidental consequence of local hunting and fishing practices, and hunting or capture for traditional medicine (15%). This represents a significant loss from such a small population of long-lived, slow breeding, species such as vultures. Cambodian vultures are severely food limited and are primarily dependent on domestic ungulate carcasses, as wild ungulate populations have been severely depleted over the past 20 years. Local people across the vulture range still follow traditional animal husbandry practices, including releasing livestock into the open deciduous dipterocarp forest areas when they are not needed for work, providing the food source. Reducing threats through limiting the use of poisons (which are also harmful for human health) and supplementary food provisioning in the short to medium-term through 'vulture restaurants' is critical if Cambodian vultures are to be conserved.

The effectiveness of the management of captive populations can be hampered by the absence of pedigree data, but molecular markers can be used to inform conservation objectives and reduce inbreeding in the captive population. Using microsatellite markers, we examined the genetic diversity and relatedness among wild-caught individuals of three critically endangered Asian vulture species, Gyps bengalensis, Gypsindicus and Gypstenuirostris, populations established for captive breeding. Estimates of the inbreeding coefficient (f) were low, indicating that populations of all three species do not appear to be inbred. Moreover, the data show that a large proportion of wild-taken birds were unrelated individuals (94.6, 87.1 and 85.3% in G.bengalensis, G.indicus and G.tenuirostris, respectively). No significant genetic differentiation (FST) was observed between historic and 2000/2001 populations of G.bengalensis in Pakistan and India. However, the more recent sampling (2002-2006) in Pakistan showed a significant difference from India. A genetic signal of a demographic bottleneck in all three species was found in some (M-ratio test), but not all, tests (heterozygote excess and mode shift in allele frequencies). Levels of genetic diversity in G.bengalensis and G.indicus populations were comparable to levels prior to or soon after the start of their decline, respectively, suggesting that adequate numbers of birds exist in captivity for these two species and reflect neutral diversity levels observed in the wild. The genetic data obtained from this study allow us to minimize the loss of neutral genetic diversity in small wild and captive populations and to identify related pairs to avoid inbreeding depression.",Management implications of genetic studies for ex situ populations of three critically endangered Asian Gyps vultures,Animal Conservation,10.1111/acv.12166

We analysed results of 62 necropsies and 48 NSAID assays of liver and/or kidney for vultures of five species found dead in India between 2000 and 2012. Visceral gout and diclofenac were detected in vultures from nine states and three species: Gyps bengalensis, Gyps indicus and Gyps himalayensis. Visceral gout was found in every vulture carcass in which a measurable level of diclofenac was detected. Meloxicam, an NSAID of low toxicity to vultures, was found in two vultures and nimesulide in five vultures. Nimesulide at elevated tissue concentrations was associated with visceral gout in four of these cases, always without diclofenac, suggesting that nimesulide may have similar toxic effects to those of diclofenac. Residues of meloxicam on its own were never associated with visceral gout. The proportion of Gyps vultures found dead in the wild in India with measurable levels of diclofenac in their tissues showed a modest and non-significant decline since the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac. The prevalence of visceral gout declined less, probably because some cases of visceral gout from 2008 onwards were associated with nimesulide rather than diclofenac.

The manufacture of veterinary formulations of diclofenac has since been banned across the region with mixed success. However, at least 12 other NSAIDs are available for veterinary use in South Asia. Aceclofenac is one of these compounds, and it is known to metabolize into diclofenac in some mammal species. The metabolic pathway of aceclofenac in cattle, the primary food of vultures in South Asia, is unknown. We gave 6 cattle the recommended dose of aceclofenac (2 mg/kg), collected blood thereafter at intervals for up to 12 h, and used liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry in a pharmacokinetic analysis of aceclofenac and diclofenac in the plasma. Nearly all the aceclofenac administered to the cattle was very rapidly metabolized into diclofenac. At 2 h, half the aceclofenac had been converted into diclofenac, and at 12 h four-fifths of the aceclofenac had been converted into diclofenac. Therefore, administering aceclofenac to livestock poses the same risk to vultures as administering diclofenac to livestock. This, coupled with the risk that aceclofenac may replace diclofenac in the veterinary market, points to the need for an immediate ban on all aceclofenac formulations that can be used to treat livestock. Without such a ban, the recovery of vultures across South Asia will not be successful.",Metabolism of aceclofenac in cattle to vulture-killing diclofenac,Conservation biology : the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology,10.1111/cobi.12711

In this study, we evaluate the toxicity of carprofen to the Gyps vulture clade through plasma pharmacokinetics evaluations in Bos taurus cattle (their food source) and Gyps africanus (a validated model species); tissue residues in cattle; and the effect of carprofen as a secondary toxicant as both tissue-bound residue or pure drug at levels expected in cattle tissues. Carprofen residues were highest in cattle kidney (7.72 ± 2.38 mg/kg) and injection site muscle (289.05 ± 98.96 mg/kg of dimension of 5 × 5 × 5 cm). Vultures exposed to carprofen as residues in the kidney tissue or pure drug equivalents showed no toxic signs. When exposed to average injection site concentrations (64 mg/kg) one of two birds died with evidence of severe renal and liver damage. Toxicokinetic analysis revealed a prolonged drug half-life of 37.75 h in the dead bird as opposed to 13.99 ± 5.61 h from healthy birds dosed intravenously at 5 mg/kg. While carprofen may generally be harmless to Gyps vultures, its high levels at the injection site in treated cattle can result in lethal exposure in foraging vultures, due to relative small area of tissue it is found therein.

In the face of uncertainty and complexity, decision-analytic approaches can be used to identify optimal management options for maximizing captive production. Building decision-analytic models requires iterations of model conception, data analysis, model building and evaluation, identification of remaining uncertainty, further research and monitoring to reduce uncertainty, and integration of new data into the model. We initiated such a process to maximize captive production of the whooping crane (Grus americana), the world's most endangered crane, which is managed through captive breeding and reintroduction. We collected 15 years of captive breeding data from 3 institutions and used Bayesian analysis and model selection to identify predictors of whooping crane hatching success. The strongest predictor, and that with clear management relevance, was incubation environment. The incubation period of whooping crane eggs is split across two environments: crane nests and artificial incubators. Although artificial incubators are useful for allowing breeding pairs to produce multiple clutches, our results indicate that crane incubation is most effective at promoting hatching success. Hatching probability increased the longer an egg spent in a crane nest, from 40% hatching probability for eggs receiving 1 day of crane incubation to 95% for those receiving 30 days (time incubated in each environment varied independently of total incubation period). Because birds will lay fewer eggs when they are incubating longer, a tradeoff exists between the number of clutches produced and egg hatching probability. We developed a decision-analytic model that estimated 16 to be the optimal number of days of crane incubation needed to maximize the number of offspring produced. These results show that using decision-analytic tools to account for uncertainty in captive breeding can improve the rate at which such programs contribute to wildlife reintroductions. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.",Decision analysis for conservation breeding: Maximizing production for reintroduction of whooping cranes,Journal of Wildlife Management,10.1002/jwmg.88

Specifically along the Texas Gulf coast, the coupled effects of decreased freshwater inflows to the estuary and natural processes (e. g., precipitation, wind, and tides) can exert significant salt-stress on coastal marsh vegetation. In this project we sought to quantitatively link the inflow of freshwater to the estuary (San Antonio Bay) with Aransas National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) coastal marsh salinity and assess the influence of salinity and inundation on Carolina wolfberry (Lycium carolinianum Walt.) phenology (leaf and fruit abundance). The Carolina wolfberry is one of the more common high marsh plant species found at ANWR and has been shown to be a key food source for endangered Whooping Cranes which inhabit the coastal marshes of the ANWR each fall/winter. Results from our study show that periods of decreased freshwater inflows to the estuary correlated with increased marsh salinity at the ANWR. Wolfberry plants at ANWR marsh sites displayed increased fruit abundance during years which had lower mean summer time salinity (June, July, and August) in San Antonio Bay; conversely, during years of increased bay salinity during the same summertime months, wolfberry plants showed decreased fruit abundance. Through the continued validation of the relationship between inflows and coastal marsh salinity, we hope to provide additional insight into how wolfberry phenology varies inter-annually across both salinity and inundation regimes and how freshwater inflows may affect food availability for the endangered Whooping Crane. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","River inflow, estuarine salinity, and Carolina wolfberry fruit abundance: Linking abiotic drivers to Whooping Crane food",Journal of Coastal Conservation,10.1007/s11852-012-0205-4

We develop a Bayesian network to assess site quality, which assigns an expected value to a property based on criteria arrayed into a causal diagram. We then use stochastic dynamic programming to determine whether an organization should acquire or reject a site placed on the public market. Our framework for assessing sites and making land acquisition decisions represents a compromise between the use of generic spatial design criteria and more intensive computational tools, like spatially-explicit population models. There is certainly a loss of precision by using site quality as a surrogate for more direct measures of persistence.

Programs tend to be initiated for species with a high level of endangerment. Depressed hatching success can be a problem for such programs and has been linked to artificial incubation. The need for artificial incubation is driven by the practice of multiclutching to increase egg production or by uncertainty over the incubation abilities of captive birds. There has been little attempt to determine how artificial incubation differs from bird-contact incubation. We describe a novel archive (data-logger) egg and use it to compare temperature, humidity, and egg-turning in 5 whooping crane (Grus americana) nests, 4 sandhill crane (G. canadensis) nests, and 3 models of artificial incubator; each of which are used to incubate eggs in whooping crane captivebreeding programs. Mean incubation temperature was 31.78 °C for whooping cranes and 32.838 °C for sandhill cranes. This is well below that of the artificial incubators (which were set based on a protocol of 37.68 °C). Humidity in crane nests varied considerably, but median humidity in all 3 artificial incubators was substantially different from that in the crane nests. Two artificial incubators failed to turn the eggs in a way that mimicked crane egg-turning.

Annual releases of captive-reared juvenile Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) were begun in 1993 in central Florida, USA, to establish a breeding, non-migratory population. Over a 12-year period, 286 birds were released, but by 2004, the introduced flock had produced only four wild-fledged birds. Consequently, releases were halted over managers' concerns about the performance of the released flock and uncertainty about the efficacy of further releases. We used data on marked, released birds to develop predictive models for addressing whether releases should be resumed, and if so, under what schedule. To examine the outcome of different release scenarios, we simulated the survival and productivity of individual female birds under a baseline model that recognized age and breeding-class structure and which incorporated empirically estimated stochastic elements. As data on wild-fledged birds from captive-reared parents were sparse, a key uncertainty that confronts release decision-making is whether captive-reared birds and their offspring share the same vital rates. Therefore, we used data on the only population of wild Whooping Cranes in existence to construct two alternatives to the baseline model. The probability of population persistence was highly sensitive to the choice of these three models. Under the baseline model, extirpation of the population was nearly certain under any scenario of resumed releases. In contrast, the model based on estimates from wild birds projected a high probability of persistence under any release scenario, including cessation of releases. Therefore, belief in either of these models suggests that further releases are an ineffective use of resources. In the third model, which simulated a population Allee effect, population persistence was sensitive to the release decision: high persistence probability was achieved only through the release of more birds, whereas extirpation was highly probable with cessation of releases. Despite substantial investment of time and effort in the release program, evidence collected to date does not favor one model over another; therefore, any decision about further releases must be made under considerable biological uncertainty. However, given an assignment of credibility weight to each model, a best, informed decision about releases can be made under uncertainty. Furthermore, if managers can periodically revisit the release decision and collect monitoring data to further inform the models, then managers have a basis for confronting uncertainty and adaptively managing releases through time. © 2010 Dt.

The whooping crane's small population size, limited distribution, and wetland habitat requirements make them vulnerable to potential climate changes. Climate change predictions suggest overall temperature increases and significant changes in precipitation regimes throughout North America. At the individual level, temperature changes should have neutral to positive effects on thermoregulation and overall energy expenditure throughout the whooping crane's range. In the breeding grounds, earlier snow melt and increasing temperatures should improve food resources. However, increased precipitation and more extreme rainfall events could impact chick survival if rainfall occurs during hatching. Increased precipitation may also alter fire regimes leading to increased woody plant abundance thus reducing nesting habitat quality. During winter, higher temperatures will lead to a northward shifting of the freeze line, which will decrease habitat quality via invasion of black mangrove. Large portions of current winter habitat may be lost if predicted sea level changes occur. Stopover wetland availability during migration may decrease due to drier conditions in the Great Plains.

We analyzed demographic data from 12 cohorts of banded Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) from the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge/Wood Buffalo National Park (ANWR/WBNP) population that had not been compiled previously into a single data base and had not been included in previous population analyses. We estimated age-specific survival and natality, parameterized an age-structured density-dependent model, and projected population sizes assuming two different estimates of wintering ground carrying capacity. Sixty-seven of 132 birds banded between 1977 and 1988 formed nesting pairs, females first produced hatchlings when 3 to 7 yrs old, and the annual proportion of mature females that reproduced successfully ranged from 0.566 to 0.606. Population projections indicate that the down-listing criterion of reaching a population size of 1000 individuals might be attained considerably later than the target year (2035) indicated in the Whooping Crane recovery plan. Even assuming that all suitable habitat within a ~100-km radius of their current winter range could be occupied, projections suggest that population size may be ~700 in 2035, and might not reach 1000 individuals until the mid-2060s.

Decisions to reduce the potential for inbreeding depression by balancing genotypic contributions to reintroduced populations may exact a cost on long-term demographic performance of the population if those decisions result in reduced numbers of animals released and/or restriction of particularly successful genotypes (i. e., heritable traits of particular family lines). As part of an effort to restore a migratory flock of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) to eastern North America using the offspring of captive breeders, we obtained a unique dataset which includes post-release mark-recapture data, as well as the pedigree of each released individual. We developed a Bayesian formulation of a multi-state model to analyze radio-telemetry, band-resight, and dead recovery data on reintroduced individuals, in order to track survival and breeding state transitions. We used studbook-based individual covariates to examine the comparative evidence for and degree of effects of inbreeding, genotype, and genotype quality on post-release survival of reintroduced individuals. We demonstrate implementation of the Bayesian multi-state model, which allows for the integration of imperfect detection, multiple data types, random effects, and individual- and time-dependent covariates. Our results provide only weak evidence for an effect of the quality of an individual's genotype in captivity on post-release survival as well as for an effect of inbreeding on post-release survival. We plan to integrate our results into a decision-analytic modeling framework that can explicitly examine tradeoffs between the effects of inbreeding and the effects of genotype and demographic stochasticity on population establishment. © 2011 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).",Bayesian analysis of multi-state data with individual covariates for estimating genetic effects on demography,Journal of Ornithology,10.1007/s10336-011-0695-0

Frequently, translocated populations have relatively low initial productivity, requiring management intervention. A translocated population of whooping cranes Grus americana in central Wisconsin is such a case. We examined chick mortality for this population and used daily chick survival rates as our response variable to model several parameters including phenology, chick age, energetics and parent age and experience. We also developed and evaluated adoption techniques using sandhill cranes Grus canadensis to mitigate the effects of high chick mortality and increase the probability of fledging. Our results illustrate the challenges that translocated populations can face as they encounter novel breeding conditions. We found that whooping crane daily chick survival was relatively low and most mortality events occurred within the first 20 days. Our results indicated that variables related to age of the parents as well as the pair's previous chick rearing experience were useful for predicting daily chick survival. We found that sandhill crane foster parents readily accepted replacement chicks. We also demonstrated adopted chicks acceptance of foster parents and that the chicks' source (captive-born vs wild-born) did not affect success of the adoption. Chick adoption provides several management options that could be used to bypass the period when chicks experience the greatest mortality. Reducing chick mortality and developing techniques to increase the number of fledged chicks is paramount for whooping crane recovery as well as the recovery of other endangered bird species. © Wildlife Biology, NKV.",Whooping crane Grus americana chick mortality and management intervention,Wildlife Biology,10.2981/12-133

Despite ongoing development and increases in infrastructure, we have few estimates of the magnitude of collision mortality. We reviewed the existing literature on avian mortality associated with transmission lines and derived an initial estimate for Canada. Estimating mortality from collisions with power lines is challenging due to the lack of studies, especially from sites within Canada, and due to uncertainty about the magnitude of detection biases. Detection of bird collisions with transmission lines varies due to habitat type, species size, and scavenging rates. In addition, birds can be crippled by the impact and subsequently die, although crippling rates are poorly known and rarely incorporated into estimates. We used existing data to derive a range of estimates of avian mortality associated with collisions with transmission lines in Canada by incorporating detection, scavenging, and crippling biases. There are 231,966 km of transmission lines across Canada, mostly in the boreal forest. Mortality estimates ranged from 1 million to 229.5 million birds per year, depending on the bias corrections applied. We consider our most realistic estimate, taking into account variation in risk across Canada, to range from 2.5 million to 25.6 million birds killed per year. Data from multiple studies across Canada and the northern U.S. indicate that the most vulnerable bird groups are (1) waterfowl, (2) grebes, (3) shorebirds, and (4) cranes, which is consistent with other studies. Populations of several groups that are vulnerable to collisions are increasing across Canada (e.g., waterfowl, raptors), which suggests that collision mortality, at current levels, is not limiting population growth. However, there may be impacts on other declining species, such as shorebirds and some species at risk, including Alberta's Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) and western Canada's endangered Whooping Cranes (Grus americana). Collisions may be more common during migration, which underscores the need to understand impacts across the annual cycle. We emphasize that these estimates are preliminary, especially considering the absence of Canadian studies. © 2013 by the author(s).",Avian mortalities due to transmission line collisions: A review of current estimates and field methods with an emphasis on applications to the Canadian electric network,Avian Conservation and Ecology,10.5751/ACE-00614-080207

Between 2005 and 2010, 63 (27 male, 36 female) hatchling whooping cranes were assigned to a reintroduction project involving autumn release of costume-reared chicks in Wisconsin. Veterinary care included preventive measures and comprehensive pre-release evaluations to improve fitness and reduce translocation of potential disease agents to native habitats. A total of 44 clinically normal birds were released (70% of assigned individuals). Cases of morbidity were classified according to primary body system affected. Musculoskeletal disorders were described in 57 birds (90%); five birds were removed from the project prior to release (8%), all for abnormalities that prevented normal function. Fourteen birds died or were euthanized prior to release (22%); pre-release mortality was attributed to developmental abnormality, predation, trauma or infectious disease. Chronic respiratory aspergillosis, diagnosed in seven birds (11%), was the most common infectious disease of concern. Predation and trauma were primary causes of post-release mortality; no evidence of infectious disease of captive origin was detected in the study population by the end of 2010. The assessment of data accumulated by this project helped to outline successful health management strategies, as well as identify and mitigate ongoing risks to captive whooping cranes that impede reintroduction efforts and achieving management goals for species recovery. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Reintroduction medicine: Whooping cranes in Wisconsin,Zoo Biology,10.1002/zoo.21097

Beginning with the development of daily nest survival models, and proceeding through subsequent extensions, the capacity for modeling the effects of hypothesized factors on nest survival has expanded greatly. We extend nest survival models further by introducing an approach to deal with incompletely observed, temporally varying covariates using a hierarchical model. Hierarchical modeling offers a way to separate process and observational components of demographic models to obtain estimates of the parameters of primary interest, and to evaluate structural effects of ecological and management interest. We built a hierarchical model for daily nest survival to analyze nest data from reintroduced whooping cranes (Grus americana) in the Eastern Migratory Population. This reintroduction effort has been beset by poor reproduction, apparently due primarily to nest abandonment by breeding birds. We used the model to assess support for the hypothesis that nest abandonment is caused by harassment from biting insects. We obtained indices of blood-feeding insect populations based on the spatially interpolated counts of insects captured in carbon dioxide traps. However, insect trapping was not conducted daily, and so we had incomplete information on a temporally variable covariate of interest. We therefore supplemented our nest survival model with a parallel model for estimating the values of the missing insect covariates. We used Bayesian model selection to identify the best predictors of daily nest survival. Our results suggest that the black fly Simulium annulus may be negatively affecting nest survival of reintroduced whooping cranes, with decreasing nest survival as abundance of S. annulus increases. The modeling framework we have developed will be applied in the future to a larger data set to evaluate the biting-insect hypothesis and other hypotheses for nesting failure in this reintroduced population; resulting inferences will support ongoing efforts to manage this population via an adaptive management approach. Wider application of our approach offers promise for modeling the effects of other temporally varying, but imperfectly observed covariates on nest survival, including the possibility of modeling temporally varying covariates collected from incubating adults. © 2013 The Authors.

However, a less recognized challenge is that the management objectives are often numerous and complex. Decision makers managing reintroduction efforts are often concerned with more than just how to maximize the probability of reintroduction success from a population perspective. Decision makers are also weighing other concerns such as budget limitations, public support and/or opposition, impacts on the ecosystem, and the need to consider not just a single reintroduction effort, but conservation of the entire species. Multiple objective decision analysis is a powerful tool for formal analysis of such complex decisions. We demonstrate the use of multiple objective decision analysis in the case of the Florida non-migratory whooping crane reintroduction effort. In this case, the State of Florida was considering whether to resume releases of captive-reared crane chicks into the non-migratory whooping crane population in that state. Management objectives under consideration included maximizing the probability of successful population establishment, minimizing costs, maximizing public relations benefits, maximizing the number of birds available for alternative reintroduction efforts, and maximizing learning about the demographic patterns of reintroduced whooping cranes. The State of Florida engaged in a collaborative process with their management partners, first, to evaluate and characterize important uncertainties about system behavior, and next, to formally evaluate the tradeoffs between objectives using the Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART). The recommendation resulting from this process, to continue releases of cranes at a moderate intensity, was adopted by the State of Florida in late 2008. Although continued releases did not receive support from the International Whooping Crane Recovery Team, this approach does provide a template for the formal, transparent consideration of multiple, potentially competing, objectives in reintroduction decision making. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.",A matter of tradeoffs: Reintroduction as a multiple objective decision,Journal of Wildlife Management,10.1002/jwmg.472

Understanding these dynamics and a population's sensitivity to them informs conservation planning, policy decisions, recovery criteria and management triggers, especially when management actions are expensive or risky. Therefore, to inform management and conservation of the only wild, migratory population of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana), we modeled its 73-year time-series of abundances and simulated future growth using Monte Carlo forecasting. We estimated the probability of the population reaching downlisting criteria. We used Monte Carlo simulation to examine this population's sensitivity to periods of negative growth (i.e., annual growth rate (r) = -0.025, -0.050, -0.100, or -0.150 for 1-3 consecutive years). We found this population exhibiting periodic declines on a 10-year cycle. We show it is unlikely to go extinct assuming conditions remain similar to the past. Our forecasts suggested the population will contain >400 birds by 2025. We found =3 consecutive years of r= -0.1 or =2 consecutive years of r= -0.15 must occur to significantly reduce abundance from the current trajectory and delay recovery. Favorably, the probability of reaching 400 birds by 2040 was 0.892 for the worst scenario. Such a scenario has only occurred once in 73. years of monitoring. Our simulations provide managers and policy makers information for evaluating recovery timelines, while forecasts aid setting habitat conservation targets. By describing how the population responds to periods of negative growth (natural or manmade), we identify management triggers, while informing monitoring frequency. Furthermore, our analyses provide a framework for moving discussions away from short-term, reactive decisions such as supplemental feeding, aquaculture, or small-scale freshwater provisioning, to long-term conservation approaches. © 2013.",Influence of whooping crane population dynamics on its recovery and management,Biological Conservation,10.1016/j.biocon.2013.04.003

For long-lived birds with low annual production, adjustment to local breeding conditions can take many years. We examined nest success rates of 2 introduced bird species, whooping crane (Grus americana) and trumpeter swan (Cygnus buccinator), in Wisconsin. Both species are long-lived with low annual reproductive rates. Trumpeter swans were established in our study area approximately 10 years before whooping cranes. We predicted that trumpeter swans would show less sensitivity to environmental stressors. We used daily nest survival rates (DNSRs) as our response variable to model several environmental parameters including weather, phenology, and ornithophilic black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae). Additionally, we examined the influence of captive history, age, release method, energetics, and nesting experience on whooping crane DNSRs. Daily nest survival of whooping cranes was the most sensitive to stressors. Trumpeter swan daily nest survival showed less sensitivity to the same stressors. Daily nest survival for both species peaked later in the nesting season, after 30 April and before 30 May. We also found that the daily nest survival rate (DNSR) for whooping cranes was potentially affected by captive exposure (measured by generations removed from the wild). Our results highlight the difficulties associated with conservation of long-lived birds with low annual productivity as they adjust to local breeding conditions and that nest phenology at the source location can determine how these conditions are interfaced. We recommend that the juxtaposition of source and introduction location nest phenology be considered prior to introduction site selection. Additionally, strategically selecting offspring from captive pairs with nest phenology similar to that of sympatric species at the introduction location should be considered. Published 2013.

Techniques included leading juveniles from Wisconsin to wintering areas by ultralight aircraft or direct release of juveniles in Wisconsin prior to their first autumn migration. With few exceptions, ultralight-led cranes released on the Florida Gulf Coast wintered in inland freshwater habitats in subsequent winters. Wintering of the population occurred in four general regions: Florida-southern Georgia, coastal Carolina, the Mid-South (primarily Tennessee and northern Alabama), and the North (Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky). Releases of ultralight-led juveniles resulted in the majority of the population returning to winter in Florida during the early years of the reintroduction. Later direct autumn releases and shortstopping by ultralight-led birds increased numbers in the Mid-South. Winter climate played a large role in wintering in the North. Drought resulted in changes in wintering locations, especially in Florida. Other factors influencing changes in distribution included habitat degradation and associations with other whooping cranes, especially new mates and birds released by different techniques. Breeding pairs and direct autumn-released birds exhibited greater winter site fidelity than did nonbreeders or ultralight aircraft-led birds, but fidelity was low for all groups. Causes of mortality differed across the winter range, with predation being most prevalent in Florida and gunshot accounting for the majority of mortalities north of Florida. Because most pairing occurred in central Wisconsin, the widespread winter distribution had no apparent negative effect on pair formation. There was no clear relationship between winter region and subsequent incubation success. The widespread distribution of the population poses minimal risk to the outcome of the reintroduction in comparison to reproduction problems in the core reintroduction area of central Wisconsin.",Winter distribution dynamics and implications to a reintroduced population of migratory whooping cranes,Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management,10.3996/092012-JFWM-088

Therefore, we examined relationships between population demographics and winter drought (1950-2011) for endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) wintering in Texas, USA. We modeled winter loss and its contribution to annual mortality as functions of winter drought, determined recruitment needed to maintain population growth after drought, and identified which demographic parameters underpin this population's growth. Previous research assumed winter loss (i.e., birds missed in subsequent surveys) represented mortality. We show that loss includes temporary emigration to upland habitats, early migration, and incomplete detection. Despite this, we maintained this assumption to evaluate the relevance of winter mortality to population growth. We found that winter loss (ß^=-0.308, SE = 0.042) and its contribution to annual mortality (ß^=-0.318, SE = 0.047) increased with drought severity (Palmer hydrological drought index; PHDI). Given average recruitment (0.145, SD = 0.090), this population increases 1.2% (95% CI = -2.9% to 4.2%) after extreme drought (PHDI = -4). No recruitment must occur for 3. years with moderate to severe drought (PHDI < -2.5) to delay species' recovery 7. years. This scenario has not occurred since population monitoring began in 1938. Of the demographic parameters we examined, winter loss explained population growth least (14.4%; 95% CI = 3.6-35.8%), and it was partially compensatory. Breeding-migratory mortality explained 42.2% (95% CI = 19.1-61.5%) of population growth and recruitment 49.9% (95% CI = 20.6-75.2%).

In cases where a species has been extirpated from a region for decades, however, this task is fraught with uncertainty. Uncertainty can be minimized and adjusted for by monitoring and adaptive management. The central goal of this study was to identify reintroduction sites that facilitate dispersion of whooping cranes (Grus americana), a federally listed endangered species, into optimal habitat as quickly as possible. First, we described the habitat selection of breeding home ranges for reintroduced whooping cranes in and around Necedah National Wildlife Refuge of central Wisconsin. We defined home ranges as 95% fixed spatial kernel density estimates from location data gathered from nesting whooping cranes from April through July 2005-2010. Whooping crane home ranges contained more emergent herbaceous wetlands than expected by chance and less developed or barren land, forest, and scrubland. Breeding whooping crane home ranges usually were composed of distinct nesting territories and off-territory elements; when moving off-territory, cranes decreased wetland selection and increased selection for open uplands. Second, we used habitat composition values and strength of selection (as determined by Jacob's index) to create a habitat suitability map to identify potential habitats that breeding whooping cranes could use in unoccupied eastern Wisconsin. With this method, we identified 2 large suitable wetland complexes within our study area associated with the Fox and Rock Rivers.

Typically, a fundamental objective of reintroduction is to establish a self-sustaining population. Estimation of demographic parameters in reintroduced populations is critical, as these estimates serve multiple purposes. First, they support evaluation of progress toward the fundamental objective via construction of population viability analyses (PVAs) to predict metrics such as probability of persistence. Second, PVAs can be expanded to support evaluation of management actions, via management modeling. Third, the estimates themselves can support evaluation of the demographic performance of the reintroduced population (e.g., via comparison with wild populations). For each of these purposes, thorough treatment of uncertainties in the estimates is critical. Recently developed statistical methods (namely, hierarchical Bayesian implementations of state-space models) allow for effective integration of different types of uncertainty in estimation. We undertook a demographic estimation effort for a reintroduced population of endangered Whooping Cranes with the purpose of ultimately developing a Bayesian PVA for determining progress toward establishing a self-sustaining population, and for evaluating potential management actions via a Bayesian PVA-based management model. We evaluated individual and temporal variation in demographic parameters based upon a multi-state, mark-recapture model. We found that survival was relatively high across time and varied little by sex. There was some indication that survival varied by release method. Survival was similar to that observed in the wild population. Although overall reproduction in this reintroduced population is poor, birds formed social pairs when relatively young, and once a bird was in a social pair, it had a nearly 50% chance of nesting the following breeding season. Also, once a bird had nested, it had a high probability of nesting again. These results are encouraging, considering that survival and reproduction have been major challenges in past reintroductions of this species. The demographic estimates developed will support construction of a management model designed to facilitate exploration of management actions of interest, and will provide critical guidance in future planning for this reintroduction. An approach similar to what we describe could be usefully applied to many reintroduced populations. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.","Demography of a reintroduced population: Moving toward management models for an endangered species, the Whooping Crane",Ecological Applications,10.1890/13-0559.1

Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) are one of the rarest birds in the world, and conservation and management of habitat is required to ensure their survival. We developed a species distribution model (SDM) that could be used to inform habitat management actions for Whooping Cranes within the state of Nebraska (U.S.A.). We collated 407 opportunistic Whooping Crane group records reported from 1988 to 2012. Most records of Whooping Cranes were contributed by the public; therefore, developing an SDM that accounted for sampling bias was essential because observations at some migration stopover locations may be under represented. An auxiliary data set, required to explore the influence of sampling bias, was derived with expert elicitation. Using our SDM, we compared an intensively managed area in the Central Platte River Valley with the Niobrara National Scenic River in northern Nebraska. Our results suggest, during the peak of migration, Whooping Crane abundance was 262.2 (90% CI 40.2-3144.2) times higher per unit area in the Central Platte River Valley relative to the Niobrara National Scenic River. Although we compared only 2 areas, our model could be used to evaluate any region within the state of Nebraska.

In some cases, stakeholders develop interdependent relationships with a species being managed by the wildlife agency, usually when the species is economically important. We studied the potential for engaging stakeholders in the implementation of community-based conservation in the winter habitat of the federally endangered whooping crane (Grus americana) to better understand the relationships between stakeholders (including landowners and nongovernmental organizations) and wildlife managers when working with charismatic species that provide local economic value. In May-September 2010, we interviewed 35 Texas individuals interested in crane conservation, and then analyzed transcripts using both a priori and emergent coding techniques. We found that active stakeholders were eager to work with wildlife managers because of the charismatic and economic values they attributed to the whooping crane. We also found that these stakeholders responded positively to agency intervention for the purpose of sharing expert knowledge and providing stakeholders with standing in the dynamically complex management practices surrounding the species and ecosystem. By recognizing the interests of active stakeholders, wildlife managers can expand opportunities for positive public participation in efforts to conserve and restore endangered species populations. They can improve community relations by building on already existing positive perceptions of relationships between humans and wildlife.","Engaging active stakeholders in implementation of community-based conservation: Whooping crane management in Texas, USA",Wildlife Society Bulletin,10.1002/wsb.565

Recently introduced, captively reared whooping cranes have had periods of poor reproductive performance in central Wisconsin that sometimes coincided with black fly (Diptera: Simuliidae) emergences. Sandhill crane Grus canadensis reproductive performance in central Wisconsin is approximately double that of whooping cranes. We used comfort behaviors as a measure of black fly harassment to infer whether behavioral differences existed between nesting sandhill cranes and nesting whooping cranes and between successful and unsuccessful whooping crane pairs. To further explore the interaction between black flies and incubating whooping cranes, we examined differences in behaviors between incubating birds and their off-nest mates. Compared to their off-nest mates, incubating whooping cranes exhibited elevated comfort behaviors, suggesting a bird at a nest may experience greater harassment from black flies. Sandhill cranes had elevated head-flicks over whooping cranes. Whooping cranes exhibited more headrubs than sandhill cranes, and successful whooping crane pairs had elevated head-rubs over pairs that deserted their nests. Behavioral differences between sandhill cranes and whooping cranes as well as differences in reproductive performance, could be explained by exposure to local breeding conditions. Whereas sandhill cranes have nested in the area for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, whooping cranes were only recently introduced to the area. Behavioral differences between the species as well as those between successful and unsuccessful whooping crane pairs could also be explained by the effect of captive exposure, which could affect all whooping crane introductions.","Hostparasite behavioral interactions in a recently introduced, whooping crane population",Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management,10.3996/042014-JFWM-032

Adaptive management (AM) combines management and monitoring, with the aim of updating knowledge and improving decision-making over time. We provide a guide for managers who may realize the potential of AM, but are unsure where to start. The urgent need for iterative management decisions, the existence of uncertainty, and the opportunity for learning offered by often highly-controlled captive environments create favorable conditions for AM. However, experiments and monitoring may be complicated by small sample sizes, and the ability to control the system, including stochasticity and observability, may be limited toward the wild end of the spectrum. We illustrate the key steps to implementing AM in threatened species management using four case studies, including the management of captive programs for cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and whooping cranes (Grus americana), of a translocation protocol for Arizona cliffroses Purshia subintegra and of ongoing supplementary feeding of reintroduced hihi (Notiomystis cincta) populations.

Despite much conservation attention for this species, there has been little study on temporal variability in demography and how that variation contributes to population dynamics. Demographic rates were most variable for fledge rate and survival of the youngest age classes while adult survival was less variable. Population growth was influenced mainly by variation in fledge rate, breeding propensity and survival of hatch year and second year cranes while survival of older age classes had less influence. Fledge rates were correlated to the boreal snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus)-Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) cycle and were lowest 2 years after increases in lynx population growth. In terms of management, mean annual fledge rates were similar between years with and without egg collection for captive rearing (0.523 vs 0.518), suggesting no influence of this practice on population-level productivity. Our findings add to the growing body of results showing that while population growth may be most sensitive to changes in adult survival in long-lived vertebrates, variation in breeding parameters often drives annual fluctuations in abundance.

Preliminary data suggest sandhill cranes nesting in central Wisconsin have apparent nest success rates that are similar to those reported from other populations in the region (~50%). One hypothesized cause of the whooping crane populations low reproductive success is nest abandonment induced by blood-feeding ornithophilic black flies Diptera: Simuliidae. Species-specific differences in selection of nest sites could influence the abundance of black flies at nests and affect reproductive success rates. We measured multiple vegetative and hydrologic characteristics at 35 sandhill crane nests, 20 whooping crane nests, and 164 randomly selected locations at 5- and 200-m scales. We were unable to detect a species-specific difference in vegetation characteristics within 5 m of nest sites.

We examined the influence of a range of hydrologic and physical metrics on total unvegetated channel width (TUCW) and maximum unobstructed channel width (MUOCW) during the period of 20072015 and applied those findings to assess the performance of the Flow-Sediment-Mechanical management strategy for creating and maintaining whooping crane roosting habitat. Our investigation highlights uncertainties that are introduced when exploring the relationship between physical process drivers and species habitat metrics. We identified a strong positive relationship between peak flows and TUCW and MUOCW within the Associated Habitat Reach of the central Platte River. However, the peak discharge magnitude and duration needed to create highly favorable whooping crane roosting habitat within our study area are much greater than short duration high flow releases, as currently envisioned. We also found disking in combination with herbicide application to vegetated portions of the channel are effective for creating and maintaining highly favorable unobstructed channel widths for whooping cranes in all but the very driest years.

In our study area, in and near Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in central Wisconsin, USA, we simultaneously tested 3 hypotheses explaining poor hatching success: harassment of incubating birds by black flies (Simuliidae), effects of captivity, and inexperience of breeders. When black flies were experimentally suppressed, hatching probability doubled. Daily nest survival for Whooping Cranes was strongly and negatively related to an index of black fly abundance, particularly of Simulium annulus. Daily nest survival was negatively but only weakly related to the number of generations that ancestors of breeding Whooping Cranes had been in captivity and was not related to nesting experience. We also examined whether Whooping Cranes were nesting later to avoid stress from black flies. Phenology shifted earlier with more growing degree days and greater nesting experience and was only weakly related to year. Overall, improved hatching success did not lead to better reproductive success. Although effects of black flies on hatching success can be mitigated through management, such actions would not be adequate to generate satisfactory population growth.

Our intent was to provide a science-driven approach for determining the effects of blood-feeding arthropods on endangered vertebrates and identifying optimal management actions for managers faced with competing objectives. A multiyear experiment demonstrated that black flies reduce nest success in cranes by driving incubating birds off their nests. We used a decision-analytic approach to develop creative management alternatives and evaluate trade-offs among competing objectives. We identified 4 management objectives: establish a self-sustaining crane population, improve crane well-being, maintain native black flies as functional components of the ecosystem, and minimize costs. We next identified potential management alternatives: do nothing, suppress black flies, force crane renesting to occur after the activity period of black flies, relocate releases of cranes, suppress black flies and relocate releases, or force crane renesting and relocate releases. We then developed predictions on constructed scales of 0 (worst-performing alternative) to 1 (best-performing alternative) to indicate how alternative actions performed in terms of management objectives. The optimal action depended on the relative importance of each objective to a decision maker. Only relocating releases was a dominated alternative, indicating that it was not optimal regardless of the relative importance of objectives. A rational decision maker could choose any other management alternative we considered. Recognizing that decisions involve trade-offs that must be weighed by decision makers is crucial to identifying alternatives that best balance multiple management objectives.

Through major ex situ conservation efforts, there are 158 whooping cranes managed in North American institutions and chicks are released annually into the wild. Current reintroduction goals for the whooping crane however, are impeded by poor reproduction within the ex situ population, in part because of low egg fertility. Development of improved management techniques to overcome low egg fertility requires a better understanding of factors that influence egg fertility. We collected data for eggs laid at Patuxent Wildlife Research Center from 20052014 (n = 438 eggs; n = 23 pairs). We constructed 5 sets of generalized linear mixed-models, with a Bernoulli-distributed response variable (fertile or infertile), to address the effects of egg-specific variables (month laid, sequence, and clutch order of the egg), life-history events of the male and female (age, rearing method, wing condition, age at first pairing, age at current pairing, and female age at first laying), pair-specific characteristics (kinship, years paired, chick-rearing experience, and previous pairings), and captive management decisions (inclusion in the artificial insemination program and pair experience chick-rearing) on the probability of egg fertility. Our results indicate that female-specific factors (especially age, age at current pairing, and wing status) and pair-specific factors of kinship, chick-rearing experience, copulation, and inclusion in the artificial insemination program influenced fertile egg production. Specifically, the younger a female is when paired with her current social mate, the higher probability that her eggs will be fertile. Furthermore, high kinship reduced fertility, whereas chick-rearing experience and artificial insemination of females with a donor male other than her social mate increased fertility. Further research on mate selection and reproductive mechanisms is needed to better understand egg laying and egg fertility in the whooping crane. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.",Factors affecting captive whooping crane egg fertility: A retrospective analysis,Journal of Wildlife Management,10.1002/jwmg.21717

However, the long-term demographic and genetic effects associated with releasing captive-born individuals with varied life histories into the wild remain largely unknown. To address this question, we developed forward-time, agent-based models for 4 species with long-running captive-breeding and release programs: coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia), western toad (Anaxyrus boreas), and Whooping Crane (Grus americana). We measured the effects of supplementation by comparing population size and neutral genetic diversity in supplemented populations to the same characteristics in unaltered populations 100 years after supplementation ended. Releasing even slightly less fit captive-born individuals to supplement wild populations typically resulted in reductions in population sizes and genetic diversity over the long term when the fitness reductions were heritable (i.e., due to genetic adaptation to captivity) and populations continued to be regulated by density-dependent mechanisms over time. Negative effects for species with longer life spans and lower rates of population replacement were smaller than for species with shorter life spans and higher rates of population replacement. Programs that released captive-born individuals over fewer years or that avoided breeding individuals with captive ancestry had smaller reductions in population size and genetic diversity over the long term. Relying on selection in the wild to remove individuals with reduced fitness mitigated some negative demographic effects, but at a substantial cost to neutral genetic diversity. Our results suggest that conservation-focused captive-breeding programs should take measures to prevent even small amounts of genetic adaptation to captivity, quantitatively determine the minimum number of captive-born individuals to release each year, and fully account for the interactions among genetic adaptation to captivity, population regulation, and life-history variation.",Long-term demographic and genetic effects of releasing captive-born individuals into the wild,Conservation Biology,10.1111/cobi.13217

As such, we focused our analyses on two robust sets of whooping crane observations and habitat metrics the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program (Program or PRRIP) and other such organizations could influence. This included channel characteristics such as total channel width, the width of channel unobstructed by dense vegetation, and distance of forest from the edge of the channel and flow-related metrics like wetted width and unit discharge (flow volume per linear meter of wetted channel width) that could be influenced by flow augmentation or reductions during migration. We used 17 years of systematic monitoring data in a discrete-choice framework to evaluate the influence these various metrics have on the relative probability of whooping crane use and found the width of channel unobstructed by dense vegetation and distance to the nearest forest were the best predictors of whooping crane use. Secondly, we used telemetry data obtained from a sample of 38 birds of all ages over the course of seven years, 20102016, to evaluate whooping crane use of riverine habitat within the North-central Great Plains, USA. For this second analysis, we focused on the two metrics found to be important predictors of whooping crane use along the central Platte River, unobstructed channel width and distance to nearest forest or wooded area. Our findings indicate resource managers, such as the Program, have the potential to influence whooping crane use of the central Platte River through removal of in-channel vegetation to increase the unobstructed width of narrow channels and through removal of trees along the bank line to increase unforested corridor widths. Results of both analyses also indicated that increases in relative probability of use by whooping cranes did not appreciably increase with unobstructed views 200 m wide and unforested corridor widths that were 330 m. Therefore, managing riverine sites for channels widths >200 m and removing trees beyond 165 m from the channels edge would increase costs associated with implementing management actions such as channel and bank-line disking, removing trees, augmenting flow, etc. without necessarily realizing an additional appreciable increase in use by migrating whooping cranes.",Whooping crane use of riverine stopover sites,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0209612

We investigated the behavior of reintroduced whooping cranes (Grus americana) trained to migrate using two different methods to see whether their migration behavior remained different or converged over time. We found that the behavior of the two groups converged relatively rapidly, indicating that early life training may not produce lasting effects, especially in species that display lifelong learning and behavioral adaptation.

Physiological responses to stress can compromise growth and reproduction, increase susceptibility to infection and lead to deleterious effects on health and conservation efforts. However, physiological measures of energetic stress in association with habitat disturbance are uncommon, especially for wild primate species. Here, we report differences in the stress hormone cortisol in two subpopulations of wild gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) inhabiting disturbed and undisturbed forest areas of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Cortisol levels were assessed via opportunistically and noninvasively collected urine samples using previously validated methods. We hypothesized that mangabeys in disturbed forest (DF) areas would experience greater stress and therefore exhibit higher average cortisol levels than conspecifics in nearby relatively undisturbed forest areas (UF). As predicted, mangabeys in the disturbed area had significantly higher cortisol levels (unpaired t-test of log transformed data, t=4.88, d.f.=108, P<0.0001). Mangabeys in undisturbed forest exhibited expected diurnal patterns of cortisol excretion while those in disturbed areas did not, suggesting alteration of the circadian pattern of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function (DF, r=0.12, P=0.43; UF, r=0.35, P=0.005). Reasons for differences are unclear, but could include altered food availability and distribution, human contact or other anthropogenic effects.

Predictors of success such as habitat quality of the release site and number of individuals released have been identified, but the dynamics of successful translocations remain poorly understood. In particular, little is known about the relationship of individual post-release movements to population establishment. In 2004, Laysan teal Anas laysanensis were reintroduced by translocating 20 wild birds from Laysan Island to Midway Atoll. Twenty-two additional wild founders were brought the next year. We monitored the survival, reproductive success and movements of the 42 translocated individuals and their offspring for 4 years. Additionally, we monitored population size from 2004 to 2010. Unlike most translocations, we did not observe elevated post-release mortality despite flight-feather trimming to prevent immediate dispersal off-island: first year survival was >90% and survival rates until 2009 were 0.65±0.08 for founding adults. Laysan teal flew between the two main islands of Midway Atoll, and offspring had significantly larger maximum movement distances than founders. We monitored 84 nests and observed a significant, negative relationship of home range size to productivity for founding females. Flightless founders did not show fidelity to their release sites, but had strong fidelity to annual home ranges after attaining flight. Although we observed a component Allee effect on mate-finding, this did not translate into a demographic Allee effect, and generally, the high fitness of founders contributed substantially to successful population establishment. Laysan teal abundance increased linearly until 2009, but showed evidence of population regulation afterwards. The population estimate was 473 (95% confidence interval 439-508) in 2010. On the much larger main Hawaiian Islands, we expect greater post-release movement, a stronger component Allee effect, lower survival and lower reproductive rates because of predation to preclude successful reintroductions of this species to sites without predator management. © 2012 The Authors.

However, because of limited evaluation of existing data, actions may be prescribed without evidence of producing a beneficial conservation outcome. We analysed empirical data, collected over 23 years across southern Australia, on the impact of fox baiting on malleefowl to determine its effectiveness. We employed data from extensive monitoring surveys to evaluate the observed relationships between investment in fox control, fox baiting intensity, fox presence and two alternative measures of the malleefowl's response: the number of breeding pairs and population growth. This study is the first to quantify the return on investment from fox control in a conservation context. We discovered there is limited quantitative evidence for a benefit of fox baiting on malleefowl, despite it being the main management action implemented for this nationally threatened, well-studied and iconic species. We found that fox baiting did not significantly decrease the presence of foxes and fox presence was positively correlated with malleefowl conservation. Malleefowl breeding population size increased with investment in baiting, although this relationship depended on the number of years the site had been baited. Nonetheless, most sites had a negative relationship between investment and breeding population. In contrast, malleefowl population growth did not benefit from baiting, suggesting that fox baiting is generally not a cost-effective management action for the conservation of this species. This study provides a powerful example of why management decisions should be based on evidence, rather than ecological intuition. Even though the malleefowl is one of the best-monitored species of conservation concern in Australia, we are still uncertain how to cost-effectively manage this species. We emphasize the urgent need to assess what data we have and determine which species and what actions are most in need of evaluation. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.",Unexpected outcomes of invasive predator control: The importance of evaluating conservation management actions,Animal Conservation,10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00537.x

Bologna,animalconservation,2012,2012,1,Describing the state of nature,1,Proposing a response,NA,8,2.692,"For planning practical measures aimed at biodiversity protection, conservation priorities must be identified at a local scale. Unfortunately, identifying local conservation priorities requires high-resolution data on species distribution, and these are often unavailable. Atlases of species distribution provide data for several groups of organisms in many different areas but are often too coarse in resolution to provide valuable information. We explored the possibility of cross-scale modelling species distributions and we clarified, for the first time, its effect on prioritization exercises. We used different modelling techniques for scaling down atlas data for Sardinian reptiles, validated the outcomes with detailed, field-sampled data, and compared conservation priorities deriving from atlas maps and downscaled models. Doing this, we obtained as a further result the identification of priority species and areas for future conservation strategies. Our results encourage us to experiment further with this approach. Through the downscaling procedure, we obtain high-resolution models with strong variations in predictive performances, although most of the models show satisfactory/excellent scores. This testifies that low-resolution data can be downscaled maintaining low rates of omission and commission errors. Increasing the resolution of distribution maps used for prioritization influences the spatial patterns of priority but does not modify the evaluation of species representation. Overall, we show that atlases can meet the large demand for distribution data by decision makers if appropriate downscaling procedures are adopted. In addition, we provide practical instruments for the conservation of reptiles in Sardinia by identifying priority species and areas that require strict management. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.",Cross-scale predictions allow the identification of local conservation priorities from atlas data,Animal Conservation,10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00526.x

Cianciaruso,animalconservation,2012,2012,2,Threatening mechanism,0,No response,NA,24,2.692,"Fire is becoming a common phenomenon in Amazonian forest, modifying the structure and composition of natural assemblages. In particular, fire is known to affect patterns of bird diversity in tropical forests, but we have little understanding of the consequences of this for the functional diversity of bird assemblages. For example, frequent fires could act as an environmental filter selecting species with similar traits and, thus, producing a functional clustering pattern. Here, we used body mass, and dietary and foraging traits to calculate the functional structure of understorey bird assemblages in Amazonian forests analysed 3 years after they had passed under three disturbance levels within the 1997-1998 El-Niño period: unburned, burned once and burned twice. First, we tested whether observed levels of functional diversity were different among these forests and also from what one would expect by chance. Then, we investigated if habitat structure was able to predict changes in the functional structure of the studied bird assemblages. In general, there was no evidence of fire reducing functional diversity nor selecting species functionally more similar than expected by chance. Therefore, bird functional diversity was not different from random in unburned and burned forests. This provides some evidence in favour of high functional redundancy of bird species in the tropics, but also indicates that neutral theories of biodiversity, where processes such as dispersal and survival are more important than biological traits to community assembly, may apply to the assemblages studied. Also, we showed that bird assemblages from forests disturbed by wildfires have the tendency to be functionally overdispersed whereas assemblages from pristine forests tend to be functionally clustered. Thus, environmental structure, in part driven by forest responses to fire, is more important than simple categorical definitions of burn frequency for explaining trait-based assembly rules of understorey birds in the Amazon forest. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.",Bird functional diversity and wildfires in the Amazon: The role of forest structure,Animal Conservation,10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00528.x

However, this assumption is rarely explicitly tested. Here, we test whether four fish species are potential indicators of overall fish diversity in the Bear River drainage (UT and WY, USA). We then examine whether biodiversity indicator relationships are driven by shared habitat associations among species by examining species-habitat models. We use these models to test for correlations between indicator species and common co-occurring species in predicted occurrence and density. Fish diversity was higher at sites with potential indicators than sites without, indicating that conservation aimed at any of these species is likely to affect a broad number of co-occurring taxa. However, with minor exceptions, habitat correlations were inconsistent between indicator and co-occurring species. Instead, most species showed idiosyncratic habitat relationships. Thus, while conservation of habitats containing indicator species is likely to positively affect the distribution of a minority of co-occurring taxa, they may have neutral (or even negative) effects on the distribution or abundance of a majority of other native taxa that are common to the region. These data suggest that reliance on indicator taxa in conservation can be misleading because they obscure important ecological information about affected non-target species. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.",Habitat relationships among biodiversity indicators and co-occurring species in a freshwater fish community,Animal Conservation,10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00538.x

The parasitic stage of endangered unionid bivalves constitutes a tight host-affiliate linkage between the mussels and their host fishes. However, the threats resulting from potential shortages of the host species are rarely sufficiently quantified and incorporated into conservation strategies. In this paper, we integrated both host quality and availability analyses to assess the potential threats to the endangered thick-shelled river mussel Unio crassus that result from the impairment of its host resources in Central Europe. The experimental determination of the compatibility of U.crassus parasitic larvae (glochidia) with its potential host fishes revealed an intermediate level of host specificity. At least, some glochidia successfully developed on 14 of the 27 potential hosts that were evaluated. Nevertheless, only three fish species (Scardinius erythrophthalmus, Phoxinus phoxinus and Cottus gobio) enabled the majority of the attached glochidia to transform successfully. Subsequently, our analysis of host availability at sites inhabited by living or extirpated populations of U.crassus showed that the local extirpations of U.crassus are likely associated with an impaired status of the fish assemblage and with the absence of the primary host fishes. These results indicate that the availability of host fish resources may have played at least an additive role in the present pan-European decline of U.crassus and that the evaluation of host limitation without precise data on the host compatibility or host abundance may be ineffective for identifying the threats to particular species. It demonstrates a strong need for more thorough incorporation of host limitation issues into conservation strategies for U.crassus and probably also for other species of freshwater mussels that were previously considered safe from host limitation. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.",Host limitation of the thick-shelled river mussel: Identifying the threats to declining affiliate species,Animal Conservation,10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00546.x

We examined whether the population history or contemporary habitat constraints of this large and mobile carnivore could have significantly affected its genetic structure. We recorded nine mtDNA haplotypes, including five not previously reported. Lynx from Latvia and Estonia had the highest variability with haplotype and nucleotide diversities of 0.81-0.88% and 0.44-0.47%, respectively.

Spatial Analysis of Molecular Variance identified four separate groups of populations: (1) Norway, Finland and Estonia; (2) Latvia and North Eastern Poland; (3) the Bialowieza Primeval Forest; (4) the Carpathians. The patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation suggested a number of discrete populations that are poorly connected by contemporary gene flow and could therefore be considered demographically independent. The peripheral location of these populations, habitat fragmentation and the strict territorial structure of lynx populations are factors likely contributing to the observed patterns.

In this study, we forecasted the effects of sea level rise (SLR) on two salt marsh specialist bird species: clapper rails Rallus crepitans and seaside sparrows Ammodramus maritimus. We sampled the abundance of these two species in salt marshes throughout the Georgia, USA, coast in 20132014, and analyzed count data using a Bayesian N-mixture model. Model predictions were applied to an SLR land cover model to determine distribution shifts over 100 years. Both species distributions were most sensitive to the relative elevation gradient, with clapper rails using lower elevation marshes and seaside sparrows using higher elevation marshes. These disparities in habitat use, along with other differences according to marsh salinity and distance to forested areas, led to divergent responses to SLR. Clapper rail habitat is predicted to increase with SLR by 52%, but seaside sparrow habitat will contract by 81% by the year 2100. Seaside sparrow habitat is not predicted to decline until sometime between 2025 and 2050, at which point the decline will rapidly accelerate, indicating the importance of careful monitoring in future decades.

In this study, we investigated the repeatability of risk assessments made under the IUCN Red List guidelines for assessment at the national level. Specifically, we assessed the national threat status of breeding and non-breeding populations of Anatidae in Iran using population and distribution data. The variable quality of these data led to uncertainties in decision-making. To evaluate the impact of these uncertainties on population trend estimates, we generated a range of alternative possible threat categories under three scenarios of population trend estimation. For the non-breeding populations, for which long-term population data were available, we were able to classify 93% of species, 72% of which were placed in threatened categories. For the breeding populations, 78% of the species were categorized as Data Deficient. Of those species in data-sufficient categories, 67% were classified as threatened. We conclude that effective use of the IUCN categories and criteria at the national level is hampered in situations where monitoring schemes have a short history.

Increasing or restoring habitat connectivity may ameliorate these effects, but the broad-reaching efforts required to assess current and future changes to connectivity, especially in low-lying areas vulnerable to SLR, are still under development. To address these issues, we strategically identified a small group of regionally significant species that represent a range of characteristics and ecological requirements useful for examining landscape connectivity. We used expert opinion to parameterize divergent species responses (i.e. resistance) to landscape features and to assess permeability of the landscape. From this, we estimated contemporary and future low-resistance habitat cores in the year 2100. We modeled six species for habitat connectivity using a multiscaled circuit theory-based approach and analysed them collectively to indicate landscape connectivity across the Southeastern United States. Using this approach, we were able to forecast changing connectivity patterns based on predicted urbanization and SLR. Our results suggest that there will be a 41% reduction in the number of low-resistance cores and a 35% decrease in mean area of remaining cores. In addition, current areas of high landscape connectivity will become more fragmented as future connectivity values indicate a more homogenized landscape structure.

We collected independent bird occurrence and abundance data along two elevational transects in Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania and the Taita Hills, Kenya. We estimated the local response to land use and compared our estimates with modelled local responses based on a large database of many different taxa across Africa. To identify the local factors mediating responses to land use, we compared environmental and species assemblage information between sites in the independent and African-wide datasets. Bird species richness and abundance responses to land use in the independent data followed similar trends as suggested by the African-wide biodiversity model, however the land-use classification was too coarse to capture fully the variability introduced by local agricultural management practices. A comparison of assemblage characteristics showed that the sites on Kilimanjaro and the Taita Hills had higher proportions of forest specialists in croplands compared to the Africa-wide average. Local human population density, forest cover and vegetation greenness also differed significantly between the independent and Africa-wide datasets. Biodiversity models including those variables performed better, particularly in croplands, but still could not accurately predict the magnitude of local species responses to most land uses, probably because local features of the land management are still missed.

We also demonstrate a behavioural shift, with locations selected for the vulnerable denning period being in more rugged terrain and in areas with lower prey densities during the lion era, as compared with the pre-lion era.

But wildlife may also be attracted to energy-dense food products that are spilled or discarded from moving vehicles, which is rarely studied. Therefore, we quantified train-spilled attractants in Banff and Yoho National Parks, Canada, where agricultural products (hereafter, grain) are transported along 134 km of railway and may contribute to wildlife mortality. We measured grain deposition from 2012 to 2015 at 19 sites and assessed the performance of three structures developed to measure spilled grain. We then modeled grain deposition with respect to four types of spatial and temporal variables: those related to grain shipment, physical habitat characteristic, train-related characteristics and variables specific to the study site. Grain was spilled at a mean rate of 1.64 g m-2 day-1 (sd = 3.60) from April to October (n = 3 years) and 1.52 (sd = 2.37) from November to March (n = 1 year). Extrapolating annual deposition across the study area yielded enough grain (110 tons) to provide 4.77 × 108 kcal of gross energy, which is equivalent to the average annual caloric needs of 4254 grizzly bears Ursus arctos horribilis; the regional population is estimated at 5073 animals. Much of this energy will not be accessible or available to bears; however, their attraction to it could contribute to rising and unsustainable rates of mortality. Models explained 931% of the variance in deposition for each grain type, primarily via coarse temporal variables of shipping rates and month. The absence of more specific predictive variables suggests that mitigation should target broader policies, such as prompt reporting and repair of leaky hopper cars, and limits to train stoppage in protected areas.

We also compared overlaps between the outputs generated by the SDM and layers representing important human threats (fishing intensity, ship density, plastic and oil pollution, ocean acidification), and calculated loss in conservation value using fishing and ship density as cost layers. The key marine areas were located on the southern Patagonian Shelf, overlapping extensively with areas of high fishing activity, and did not change seasonally, while seasonal areas were located off south and southeast Brazil and overlapped with areas of high plastic pollution and ocean acidification. Non-seasonal key areas were located off northeast Brazil on an area of high biodiversity, and with relatively low human impacts. We found support for the use of seasonal areas depending on the seabird assemblage used, because there was a loss in conservation value for the seasonal compared to the non-seasonal approach when using cost layers. Our approach, accounting for seasonal changes in seabird assemblages and their risk of extinction, identified additional candidate areas for incorporation in the network of pelagic MPAs.","Identification of candidate pelagic marine protected areas through a seabird seasonal-, multispecific- and extinction risk-based approach",Animal Conservation,10.1111/acv.12339

Here we evaluated how habitat heterogeneity-at the local and landscape scales-affects the diversity of ants in the Brazilian Cerrado. The Cerrado is a biodiversity hotspot that is characterized as a mosaic of habitats, including savannas of variable structure (the dominant vegetation), grasslands, and forests. We sampled ground-dwelling ants in four habitats, representing a gradient of increasing tree cover and decreasing grass cover. Twelve sites, distributed along two degrees of latitude, were sampled. Our sampling revealed a highly diverse and patchily distributed fauna comprising 150 species (from 44 genera), of which nearly 40% were found in only one site. On average, we found fewer species in the least structurally complex habitat. However, there was relatively little variation in species density among the remaining habitats despite strong differences in vegetation structure among them. Ant species composition varied markedly among sites and such differences were related to variations in vegetation structure but not to inter-site distances (latitude). Similar results were obtained when overall ant species richness (<U+03B3> diversity) was partitioned additively into three components: a 1 (diversity within sampling sites), ß 1 (diversity among sites within the same habitat type), and ß 2 (diversity among sites from different habitats). The ß 2 component contributed much more to <U+03B3> diversity than did the remaining diversity components, indicating that conservation of the Cerrado ant fauna depends on the maintenance of habitat diversity. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Habitat diversity enhances ant diversity in a naturally heterogeneous Brazilian landscape,Biodiversity and Conservation,10.1007/s10531-011-0221-y

We analyzed for true inconsistencies across lists in order to evaluate practical consequences of such incongruences on amphibian conservation in Brazil. We recorded a total of 61 threatened amphibian species in Brazil (across all red lists). Only one species, Phrynomedusa fimbriata, was listed as Extinct (both in IUCN, Brazil and São Paulo lists). A total of eleven endemic species are listed as threatened by the global red list, but do not appear in Brazil's national red list, which represent an inconsistence among these lists. Besides that, the threat category of Thoropa lutzi and Thoropa petropolitana, two endemic species, differ among both lists, which also represents a problem between both lists. These mismatches may be due to several reasons such as different interpretation of the criteria; different methodologies used; different data availability on species; differences in the dates of assessments processes; the assessors' attitudes to uncertainty; outdated red lists.

We investigated the impact of bark beetle attacks and subsequent salvage logging on insectivorous bats in a temperate mountain forest. We quantified bat activity (25,373 min counts; 32 plots) using batcorders during 221 all-night surveys in stands killed by bark beetles, with dead trees removed or not, and in vital, single- or multi-layered mature forest stands. We analysed the differences in activity of all bats in general and of bats of foraging guilds (open habitat, forest edge, closed habitat) in these habitats using a generalized linear Poisson mixed model, with plot and observation as random factors, and temperature and habitat as fixed factors. Only open-habitat foragers were slightly more active in salvage-logged stands than in bark-beetle-affected stands; they generally benefited from an open forest canopy, whereas closed-habitat foragers did not. Our results indicated that: (1) bats are less affected by salvage logging after a disturbance of a magnitude typical for European forests, probably because enough roosts are present in surrounding areas, (2) habitats for open foragers are improved by bark beetle infestation and (3) bats are poor bioindicators of negative impacts of salvage logging after natural disturbance in forests with a composition typical for Central Europe. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",The effect of bark beetle infestation and salvage logging on bat activity in a national park,Biodiversity and Conservation,10.1007/s10531-012-0334-y

The wildlife trade is driven chiefly by consumer demand, largely in developed nations (but increasingly in Asia), and more species are traded to meet international demand for pets than for any other purpose. We surveyed traders of amphibians and reptiles in the Indonesian provinces of Maluku, West Papua and Papua between September 2010 and April 2011. We recorded 5,370 individuals representing 52 species collected solely for the pet trade. At least 44 % were either fully protected or had not been allocated a harvest quota, making their harvest and trade illegal. Approximately half were listed within the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Trade operates via a complex chain, with hunters receiving little income compared to middlemen and exporters. Examination of Indonesian harvest quotas for amphibians and reptiles suggests limited knowledge of species distributions, with quotas often set for species in provinces where they do not occur. Illegal trade is due, partly, to an inadequate understanding of the species being traded and is facilitated by poor monitoring and enforcement at key trade hubs. As a first step to combatting illegal trade, and to better understand the effects of harvest on wild populations, we recommend the need for increased monitoring and enforcement, improving the knowledge base of species traded and educating consumers about the effects their demand for pets has on these species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Exploited for pets: The harvest and trade of amphibians and reptiles from Indonesian New Guinea,Biodiversity and Conservation,10.1007/s10531-012-0345-8

This subspecies occupies the westernmost position of the species' general range. The persistence on the Iberian Peninsula of very long-lived specimens of Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii, along with their sensitivity to climate, has drawn the attention of many researchers, but to date the importance of dendroecological studies relating to conservation of biodiversity or the genetic resources of this taxon had not been stressed. In the present paper we use dendroecological methods to analyse the relict pine forest in Navalacruz, an interesting and endangered genetic forestry resource on the northern slopes of the Gredos mountains (in Spain's Central System Range) at the subspecies' south-western global limit. This forest provides a prime example for demonstrating the potential application of dendroecology for studying the origin, dynamics, local variability, relationships with climate and anthropogenic disturbances of relict forest populations. We dated 93 growth sequences from 47 trees ranging from 1809 to 2006 and we have determined that interspecific competition is the most relevant factor as regards differences in the diameter growth of these trees. Moreover, we detected great variability and numerous common growth disturbances unrelated to climatic oscillations. These quasi-periodic disturbances alternate between suppression and release suggesting continuous management cycles of different intensities. Despite its high level of disturbance, the pine forest presents a certain degree of climatic sensitivity. Comparing with others Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii populations, we denoted a temporal grading of the growth response to precipitation that is indicative of differences in the start and length of the vegetative period. Furthermore, we compiled different dendroecological and palaeobiogeographical data to demonstrate that this dense, homogeneous and relatively younger P. nigra population is of an indigenous nature.

In northern Europe, oak sustains the highest richness of saproxylic invertebrates, among which beetles is a large group. In order to preserve species associated with old trees, it has become common practice in commercial forestry to retain such trees at final felling. However, to create beneficial conditions for species associated with retained trees, the surrounding plantation has to be managed with regard to their specific demands. In the case of oak-associated species, including many red-listed species, several studies have shown that light is an important factor. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of increased openness around oaks (Quercus robur) in spruce plantations (Picea abies) on species richness and abundance of oak-associated saproxylic beetles. The study was performed in nine spruce plantations located in southern Sweden, with mature oaks standing in a gradient of canopy openness. Beetles were collected from 54 oaks from May to September during two seasons, using window traps. The analyses revealed that increased openness around oaks increases species richness and abundance of oak-associated beetles. By including insolation angle in the analysis, we found that it is mainly the degree of openness directed south from the oak that has positive effects on beetle richness. These findings imply that it is desirable to maintain an open area around retained oaks, and that this area should be placed on the southern side of the oak to maximize the biodiversity benefit in relation to costs for the forest owner. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Increased openness around retained oaks increases species richness of saproxylic beetles,Biodiversity and Conservation,10.1007/s10531-012-0353-8

From a conservation perspective, identifying the primary preferred habitats could help improve the foraging conditions of target species and, consequently, enhance their breeding success and survival. Here, we investigated the ranging behaviour and foraging habitat selection of the European roller (Coracias garrulus) during the breeding season in an agricultural landscape of South Iberia. The occurrence of foraging rollers was predicted to gradually increase with decreasing distance from the nest and increasing availability of perches, such as fences and electric wires. Traditional olive groves and stubble fields were positively and negatively associated with the occurrence of rollers, respectively. Additionally, analysis of hunting strikes showed that rollers highly prefer foraging in fallows rather than cereal or stubble fields. Prey surveys revealed that fallows had the highest abundance of grasshoppers, rollers preferred prey during chick-rearing. Pair home-ranges, obtained from 95% fixed Kernel estimators averaged 70.9 ha (range = 34118 ha) and most foraging trips (80%) occurred in the close vicinity of the nest (<500 m). Number of chicks fledged was not affected by mean foraging distances travelled during the chick-rearing period. Overall, our results suggest that traditional extensive practices of cereal cultivation, with large areas of low-intensity grazed fallows, represent a high-quality foraging habitat for rollers and should be promoted through agri-environmental schemes within at least 1-km radius from the nest. These recommendations are targeted at the roller, but have been shown to apply broadly to several other steppe-bird species.",Landscape determinants of European roller foraging habitat: implications for the definition of agri-environmental measures for species conservation,Biodiversity and Conservation,10.1007/s10531-016-1241-4

Population sizes in the latter two estuaries have been very small for a prolonged period of time, and the populations residing in them may thus benefit from translocations as a means of increasing population sizes and possibly also genetic diversity. However, information on whether these three estuaries constitute distinct conservation units that warrant separate management is presently lacking. Here, we used genetic information from mitochondrial (control region) and nuclear microsatellite loci to assess the genetic diversity and spatial structure across the three estuaries, and also whether translocations should be included in the management plan for the Knysna seahorse. Although each population had a unique combination of alleles, and clustering methods identified the Swartvlei Estuary as being distinct from the others, levels of genetic admixture were high, and there was no evidence for reciprocal monophyly that would indicate that each estuary has a unique demographic history. On these grounds, we suggest recognising the three populations as a single evolutionarily significant unit (ESU), and encourage translocations between them to ensure the species long-term survival.",Conservation implications of significant population differentiation in an endangered estuarine seahorse,Biodiversity and Conservation,10.1007/s10531-017-1300-5

We studied the importance of old trees as micro-refuges and microclimate stability in maintaining lichen survival and diversity. The study was situated in mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests of the Gorgany Mountains of the Ukrainian Carpathian mountain belt. Lichens were collected on 13 circular study plots (1000 m2). Dendrochronological methods were used to reconstruct age structure and maximum disturbance event history. A linear mixed effects model and general additive models were used to explain patterns and variability of lichens based on stand age and disturbance history for each plot. Tree age was the strongest variable influencing lichen diversity and composition. Recent (<80 years ago) severely disturbed plots were colonized only by the most common species, however, old trees (>200 years old) that survived the disturbances served as microrefuges for the habitat-specialized and/or dispersal limited species, thus epiphytic lichen biodiversity was markedly higher on those plots in comparison to plots without any old trees. Most species were able to survive microclimatic change after disturbances, or recolonize disturbed patches from surrounding old-growth forests. We concluded that the survival of old trees after disturbances could maintain and/or recover large portions of epiphytic lichen biodiversity even in altered microclimates.",Old trees as a key source of epiphytic lichen persistence and spatial distribution in mountain Norway spruce forests,Biodiversity and Conservation,10.1007/s10531-017-1338-4

Diverse societal worldviews however create differences in the way cultures relate to and understand the environment. The objective of this study was to identify community-based indicators and metrics used by Maori in New Zealand to monitor forest health and community wellbeing. Eighty semi-directed interviews were conducted with 55 forest users within the Tuawhenua tribal group to identify forest health indicators and associated gradient of metrics to assess each indicator. Indicators were grouped within nine culturally-relevant themes: (1) food procurement (mahinga kai), (2) natural productivity (hua o te whenua), (3) nature of water (ahua o te wai), (4) nature of the land (ahua o te whenua), (5) nature of the forest (ahua o te ngahere), (6) perpetual occupation of land and place (ahikaaroa), (7) spiritual dimension (taha wairua), (8) physical health (taha kikokiko), and (9) mental health (taha hinengaro). Within these themes, indicators and associated metrics were aligned within two monitoring approaches: field survey and interview-based. Community members (n = 35 individuals) were asked to prioritise field survey indicators using a seven point Likert Scale of importance. A second survey was also conducted with Tuawhenua elders (n = 43 individuals) to determine changes in the frequency of forest use by the community. A decline in the proportion of the community venturing into the forest over the last 60 years for activities such as hunting, fishing, camping, and collecting plant resources was reported. This decline in regular forest use suggests a field survey approach would be an effective method for applying community-based indicators and to gain an understanding of forest health. Forest indicators that are evaluated over a longer timeframe (months, seasons or even years), or those indicators aligned with community wellbeing, would be better evaluated using an interview-based approach. The alignment of some community-based indicators with scientific-based measures would enrich and deepen knowledge about the state of biodiversity, broaden the relevance of monitoring and reporting within indigenous communities, and help to mitigate issues of shifting baselines.",An indigenous community-based monitoring system for assessing forest health in New Zealand,Biodiversity and Conservation,10.1007/s10531-016-1142-6

Studies on molluscs from this area have been historically centred in economic resources and few works have referred to non-commercial species. The present study aims to document the biological diversity of molluscs at the SMG/SJG area, in order to determine the significance of these two gulfs in the context of the Argentine marine fauna; to evaluate how well represented is this fauna in three protected areas; and to compare the fauna present in the protected areas with that of a non-protected area. For that purpose, molluscs coming from 132 sampling stations, ranging from the intertidal to 170 m depth, were studied, and a thorough bibliographic compilation was performed. A total of 196 species of molluscs are reported for the area. Surprisingly, almost one third of these species lacked previous records for SMG/SJG, including several new/possibly new species. The three studied protected areas contain 88.3% of the species recognised for the entire SMG/SJG area. Although several species appear as exclusive from one of these three areas, many of them are also present in an intermediately located, non-protected area. Molluscan diversity at the SMG/SJG area is greater than previously thought, comprising about 41.4% of the bivalves and 37.8% of the gastropods present in the Argentine shelf; thus suggesting that the area may be considered as a hot-spot of diversity in the Argentine Sea.","A hot-spot of biodiversity in Northern Patagonia, Argentina",Biodiversity and Conservation,10.1007/s10531-017-1408-7

Thus, an integrated approach is needed that includes the cryptic diversity represented partly by lichens, which are among the most sensitive organisms to environmental change due to their physiological characteristics. The use of functional traits and ecological attributes may improve the interpretation of how species respond to climate change. Thus, we quantified the future climate change impacts on 41 lichen species distributed in the Iberian Peninsula using ensemble climatic suitability maps (derived from generalized linear and generalized additive models, and classification and regression tree analysis) and different metrics. We also determined the lichen traits/attributes that might be related to a shared response to climate change. The results indicated a loss of bioclimatic space for 75% of the species studied and an increase for 10 species, especially in Mediterranean ones. Most of the species that will lose more than 70% of their current modeled distribution area comprised big macrolichens with cyanobacteria as the photobiont, thereby indicating a great biomass loss in forests, which might affect nutrient cycles. We also found that the predicted distributions were trait-related. Smaller species, green-algae lichens, and saxicolous and epiphyte species will respond better to future climate change. The results of this type of study may help to identify the species that are most vulnerable to climate change and facilitate the development of conservation measures to avoid their decline.",Case study of the implications of climate change for lichen diversity and distributions,Biodiversity and Conservation,10.1007/s10531-016-1289-1

Management strategies are urgently required to halt further habitat decline and to aid in restoration of this important moss-dominated summit community. Grazing exclosure and phosphorus (P) addition experiments were conducted at 10 sites across the UK to assess the potential of Racomitrium heath to respond to (1) the removal of grazing pressure, and (2) the addition of P, a measure intended to alleviate the impacts of high N deposition. After two years, growth and depth of Racomitrium lanuginosum, the dominant moss species, were significantly enhanced by both treatments. However, while the addition of P resulted in increased cover of R. lanuginosum and decreased grass cover, grazing exclusion resulted in the opposite effects. While both practices clearly have the potential to promote improvement in the condition of Racomitrium heath, their suitability for individual sites appears to differ. Results indicate that for the most degraded heaths, where grass abundance is high, complete removal of grazing pressure may, at least initially, stimulate grass performance, potentially leading to further habitat decline. The addition of P, on the other hand, appears to produce desirable effects in terms of both R. lanuginosum performance and community composition, and thus could be used as a local management option to kick-start recovery in the most damaged heaths. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Grazing exclusion and phosphorus addition as potential local management options for the restoration of alpine moss-sedge heath,Biological Conservation,10.1016/j.biocon.2012.04.025

Using empirical data, we investigate a prior conceptual proposition that target-based planning may lead to lower average protection levels across biodiversity features due to its prescriptive nature where conservation outcome is measured in terms of achievement of many independently developed targets. We used spatial distribution models and externally provided targets set for 253 biodiversity features from the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany hotspot and compared target-based planning to alternative approaches, such as maximum-utility planning, which can operate without the specification of strict targets. We found that target-based planning retained on average a significantly lower fraction of the distributions of all biodiversity features than did alternative methods. This sub-optimality fundamentally follows from the nestedness of species distributions being ignored in target setting, leading to investment in features that occur in relatively species-poor and expensive areas. Consequently, benefit-based alternatives to target-based planning will achieve higher overall conservation performance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Empirical evidence for reduced protection levels across biodiversity features from target-based conservation planning,Biological Conservation,10.1016/j.biocon.2012.04.015

Even slight changes in climate resulted in remarkably reduced rates of growth and detrimental effects on the health of the transplanted epiphyte species over 2. years. Non-vascular epiphytes in this forest type respond much more rapidly to changes in water availability than terrestrial trees. The non-vascular lichen, Nephromopsis pallescens, is highly sensitive to changes in moisture and temperature, and could be adopted as a climate change indicator. Non-vascular epiphyte species may be negatively affected or even severely damaged in the future in subtropical montane forests, as climate conditions are predicted to be warmer and drier.

These forests are being altered at a rapid rate, especially by industrial logging and swidden farming. Wildfires, expanding oil palm plantations, and industrial mining are also causing forest loss. At current rates of exploitation, most industrially accessible forests in PNG are projected to be logged or cleared in just 1-2 decades. Much of the country's timber is exported as raw logs, mainly to China, providing only limited income and employment for local communities. Despite growing exploitation of its natural resources, many social indicators in PNG, such as per-capita income, literacy, and the Human Development Index, remain alarmingly low. We highlight a range of near-term policy measures designed to improve forest conservation and sustainability in PNG. These include: (1) reducing annual timber harvests to a more-sustainable level, (2) curtailing raw-log exports while promoting expansion of domestic wood-processing industries, (3) combating serious corruption in the forestry sector, (4) reinstating the rights of traditional communities in PNG to sue corporations for past or anticipated environmental damage, (5) expanding and improving the management of protected areas, and (6) stabilizing the administration of international carbon-trading funds designed to reduce emissions from forest conversion. We also recommend that educational and family-planning support be improved for younger women to help reduce the destabilizing effects of rapid population growth.

There, the causes of decline have not been properly identified and conservation decisions are too frequently based on poor evidence. We analysed the trend of a relict capercaillie population in the Spanish Pyrenees on the basis of bird densities during the period 1989-2010, and we developed the first modelling exercise for the dynamics of a capercaillie population in southern Europe. We also explored management actions commonly used to enhance endangered prey species thought to be affected by hyperpredation: the release of captive-bred females, in varying numbers, the removal of predators and the combination of both actions, using available information from past captive-breeding experiments and from an ongoing experiment involving the removal of terrestrial mesopredators. The population was found to be declining at an annual rate of 4%. Restraining the unknown adult survival rate according to values reported in the literature, our modelling approach showed that recruitment (productivity. +. fledgling survival), rather than adult survival, was the demographic parameter to be improved as a result of management and, thus, most likely to increase the population growth rate. The removal of terrestrial mesocarnivores may lead to the stabilisation of the capercaillie population (lambda 0.99. ±. 0.06), through the improvement of productivity, although this result should be considered as preliminary. However, the most effective management strategy was the combination of predator removal together with the release of 15, 30 or 45 adult females per year. These strategies should be viewed as urgency measures and should be implemented in combination with other long-term measures, such as the reduction of forest density, which may influence predation rate and food availability, and the control of the numbers of wild ungulates, which could be subsidising mesopredators in the area. We also present the adaptive management framework which will allow the results obtained from our current modelling to be updated in the near future, what will reduce the uncertainty regarding the best conservation strategies to apply in this and other similar populations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Assessing different management scenarios to reverse the declining trend of a relict capercaillie population: A modelling approach within an adaptive management framework,Biological Conservation,10.1016/j.biocon.2012.01.047

The current extinction crisis has resulted in a wealth of monitoring programs focussed on tracking the status of threatened species, and the perceived importance of monitoring has seen it become the cornerstone of many biodiversity conservation programs. However, many monitoring programs fail to produce useful outcomes due to inherent flaws. Here we use a monitoring program from south-eastern Australia as a case study to illustrate the potential of such endeavours. The threatened carnivorous marsupial, the brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa), has been monitored at various locations between 2000 and 2010. We present strong evidence for a decline in relative abundance during this period, and also describe relationships with environmental variables. These results provide insights likely to be valuable in guiding future management of the species. In the absence of the monitoring program, informed management would not be possible. While early detection of population declines is important, knowledge of the processes driving such declines is required for effective intervention. We argue that monitoring programs will be most effective as a tool for enhanced conservation management if they test specific hypotheses relating to changes in population trajectories. Greater emphasis should be placed on rigorous statistical analysis of monitoring datasets in order to capitalise on the resources devoted to monitoring activities. Many datasets are likely to exist for which careful analysis of results would have benefits for determining management directions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Conservation cornerstones: Capitalising on the endeavours of long-term monitoring projects,Biological Conservation,10.1016/j.biocon.2011.10.016

How do free-ranging livestock impact giant panda habitats and what are the implications for future conservation and policy on a larger scale? We use Wanglang National Nature Reserve as a case study. It has seen a nine-fold livestock increase during past 15 years. We combined bamboo survey plots, GPS collar tracking, long-term monitoring, and species distribution modelling incorporating species interaction to understand the impacts across spatial and temporal scales. Our results showed that livestock, especially horses, lead to a significant reduction of bamboo biomass and regeneration. The most intensively used areas by livestock are in the valleys, which are also the areas that pandas prefer. Adding livestock presence to predictive models of the giant panda's distribution yielded a higher accuracy and suggested livestock reduce panda habitat by 34%. Pandas were driven out of the areas intensively used by livestock. We recommend the nature reserve carefully implement a livestock ban and prioritise removing horses because they cause the greater harm. To give up livestock, local communities prefer long-term subsidies or jobs to a one-time payment.

Despite the recent surge of studies of senescence in the wild, senescence patterns in species for which population dynamics assessments are crucial, such as translocated populations, remain virtually unexplored. Based on a 15-year nest survey of a North-African Houbara bustard population in Morocco, we investigated age variation in the breeding performance of captive-bred females released in the wild. We identified 781 females, from 1 to 10 years of age, on 1094 nests. We examined how age influenced nest initiation date, clutch size, egg volume, daily nest survival and daily brood survival, as well as whether age-dependent patterns varied according to environmental conditions. Most breeding parameters exhibited variation, suggesting an increase in breeding performance with age in young females (those from 1 to 3 years old). In older females (> 78 years old), the egg volume and clutch size decreased with age, in concordance with expectations from senescence theories and previous empirical results obtained from captive Houbara bustards. Finally, our analysis uncovered a significant interaction between age and the amount of precipitation prior to the breeding season on clutch size, suggesting differential abilities of females of different ages to increase their breeding investment. Our study suggests that life histories in translocated individuals are not affected by translocation protocols and provides insights for implementing age dependencies in population viability assessments.",Evidence of reproductive senescence of released individuals in a reinforced bird population,Biological Conservation,10.1016/j.biocon.2017.08.023

We further related morpho-ecological traits and the geographic distribution of lizard species to the spatial metrics of islands where they occurred. Using 100 L-pitfall traps operated over 5447 trap-days, we recorded 1123 lizards from 17 taxa, two of which exclusively found along stream banks within continuous forest. Island area was the best predictor of species richness and composition. Small islands (= 2 ha) harboured fewer than a third of all species typically observed in larger islands and continuous forest (= 8 species), and only islands = 100 ha retained nearly complete lizard faunas. Lizard assemblages inhabiting small, isolated islands consisted almost exclusively of an oversimplified set of widely distributed, large-bodied, habitat generalist, heliophile species associated with open areas and forest edges, and that feed on a wide spectrum of prey sizes.

Species were selected by their occurrence in England, the primary focus of the study, but climate change impacts were assessed across Great Britain, widening their geographical relevance. A basic risk assessment that compared projected future changes in potential range with recently observed changes classified 21% of species as being at high risk and 6% at medium risk of range loss under a B1 climate change scenario. A greater number of species were classified as having a medium (16%) or high (38%) opportunity to potentially expand their distribution.

A rapid eradication response with herbicides has been identified as a priority invasion control strategy.

Variability in data was driven by seasonal dynamics and natural lake-to-lake differences typical of high latitude waterbodies, indicating lack of evidence for systematic impacts to water quality or plankton communities associated with herbicide treatment of Elodea. Impacts on native macrophytes were benign with the exception of some evidence for earlier onset of leaf senescence for lily pads (Nuphar spp.) in treated lakes. We observed a substantial increase in detected native flora richness after Elodea was eradicated from the most heavily infested lake, indicating potential for retention of native macrophyte communities if infestations are addressed quickly.

Springs, sites where groundwater discharges at the Earth's surface, are often the only perennial aquatic environments in arid regions. By providing habitats for aquatic biota, as well being an essential water resource for terrestrial species and human settlements, they are small natural features that make a contribution to ecological processes and biodiversity that extends far beyond their area. Many contain endemic, rare or relictual species of plants, fishes and invertebrates and are recognized as globally important biodiversity hotspots and evolutionary and ecological refugia. However, water resource development and invasive species are major threats to these systems. Future climate scenarios indicate that extended droughts may become more common in some arid regions. Such droughts will increase the pressure to extract groundwater for human uses. Increasing aquifer drawdown will result in the loss of some spring habitats and the endemic and dispersal-limited species they support. Conservation challenges include addressing the additive impacts of water extraction and exotic and invasive species and managing recreational activities. Although the isolation and small size of arid land springs makes them extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts, it also means that protection and management may be more feasible and cost effective than for larger aquatic ecosystems. However, multiple approaches and ongoing actions will be required to address additive impacts.

The effectiveness of protected area management remains a concern for donors and policy-makers. However, very few feasible methods assessing the ability and performance of management teams have been developed. Behavioral shifts in habitat usage, direct and sensitive wildlife responses to threats, have been ignored in the evaluation of protected area management. To address the technical limitations, we developed a method that uses the behavioral dynamics of target species as indicators of the efficacy of threat reduction, control, and overall management effort. By comparing wildlife behavior with threat avoidance distances and patterns we can examine threat mitigation efficacy as a proxy for overall reserve management effectiveness. Using evidence of giant panda habitat utilization in eleven reserves across Qinling Mountains from 2000 to 2012, we built a model of behavior based on the avoidance of four types of anthropogenic threat. We stratified the eleven reserves into five efficacies, of which Changqing reserve was deemed to have the highest management effectiveness. Our approach was validated and supported by changes in suitable habitat and population size across reserves. Focusing on the end result of all threats and management effort means that our framework is straightforward for reserve staff to implement, produces easily interpreted results, and is worthy of application. This study highlights the value of behavioral dynamics when making a full and scientific assessment of the effectiveness of protected area management, and helps investors and policy-makers realize the efficacy of conservation inputs.",Measuring the effectiveness of protected area management by comparing habitat utilization and threat dynamics,Biological Conservation,10.1016/j.biocon.2017.04.027

One proposed solution is to disaggregate global datasets to generate national-level indicators for countries where these values do not exist, but to date there are few examples where this approach has been systematically applied and its efficacy investigated. Using comparisons of disaggregated global data and data generated nationally for four indicators in five tropical Andean countries, we show that the two approaches can often lead to divergent values. Differences between values gathered using these two methods vary according to country and indicator, with the average differences for all countries as 26% for forest cover loss (maximum Bolivia 31%), 10% for the Red List Index (maximum Venezuela 27% for birds), 14% for protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas (maximum Colombia 25%), and 67% for carbon sequestration potential (maximum Peru 102%). Most of the variations are due to methodological differences, calling into question the reliability of inter-country comparisons and roll-ups of national indicator data to regional or global scales. Nationally-generated indicators are desirable because they have the greatest power to influence national policy. However, in cases where regional or global consistency is needed, such as assessments by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and Global Environmental Outlook, assessors should rely on global and regionally-disaggregated global data to elucidate trends and spatial patterns for most indicators. To broaden the utility of nationally-generated indicators, the biodiversity indicators community must agree on methodological standards, ensure that local stakeholders' needs are understood and addressed, develop incentives for the use of these standards, and communicate them to practitioners at all levels.",Monitoring national conservation progress with indicators derived from global and national datasets,Biological Conservation,10.1016/j.biocon.2016.08.023

The model was based on temperature-dependent stage-structured population dynamics given by a system of ordinary differential equations. We proposed a methodology to identify habitats that are non-invasible for P. marinus using the threshold of R 0(T) < 1 in order to identify potentially invasible habitats.

Their profound effects may alter the sources and pathways of primary production. We investigated the effects of the reef forming polychaete Ficopomatus enigmaticus invasion on the biomass and distribution of estuarine macroalgae in a SW Atlantic coastal lagoon (Mar Chiquita, 37° 40'S, 57° 23'W, Argentina). Reefs built by this species serve as substrates for macroalgal development and furnish structures that modify physical and biological conditions for the surrounding benthos. We showed that (1) the red macroalga Polysiphonia subtilissima settles and grows almost exclusively on the surface of the reef, (2) the green macroalgae Cladophora sp. and Enteromorpha intestinalis are found almost exclusively in areas without reefs attached to mollusk shells and, (3) no macroalgae occur in the sediment between reefs. Manipulative experiments show that reefs provide a complex substrate for settlement and survival and therefore benefit red macroalga. These experiments also show that the invasive reef builder has negative indirect effects on green macroalgae by increasing grazing and probably by increased sedimentation between reefs. Via these direct and indirect effects, reefs change the relative biomass contribution of each macroalgal species to the overall production in the lagoon. Knowledge of these processes is important not only for predicting net effects on primary production but also because changes in macroalgal species composition may produce effects that cascade through the food web. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Effects of an invasive reef-building polychaete on the biomass and composition of estuarine macroalgal assemblages,Biological Invasions,10.1007/s10530-011-0115-7

We investigated the potential for hybridization between the exotic hybrid Populus x canadensis Moench and its wild relative, the European black poplar (Populus nigra L.), by a series of pollination experiments in the greenhouse. We also tested the effect of mixtures of pollen from the taxon's own pollen and pollen of the foreign taxon on mating success in reciprocal crosses. We observed reduced pollen and seed viability of the hybrid clones of P. x canadensis compared to the clones of the parental species P. nigra. Surprisingly, when in combination with pollen of its wild relative P. nigra, pollen of exotic P. x canadensis sired significantly better on its own flowers. In poplar breeding, the pollen mentor technique which uses pollen mixes of artificially inactivated conspecific pollen and untreated incompatible foreign pollen, has been successfully used to overcome incompatibility barriers. The results of this study suggest that in the wild, where mixed pollen loads are common, similar effects as the pollen mentor effects may enhance the invasiveness of exotic P. x canadensis.

Ongoing and future climatic change may alter the performance of native and non-native species and their biotic interactions. In the northern hemisphere, expected climate changes include warmer temperatures and higher precipitation, the latter of which may increase dissolved organic carbon (humic) concentrations, resulting in browner water in aquatic ecosystems (brownification). We tested the effects of elevated temperature (3 °C) and brownification on native and non-native aquatic plant production in mesocosms over 56 days. Elodea canadensis, an aquatic invasive plant, had higher relative growth rate in terms of both length and weight, as well as higher weight to length ratio when grown in brown versus clear water; E. canadensis did not respond to temperature treatments. Different functional groups of native producers (phytoplankton, periphyton, macrophytes) showed different relationships to temperature and brownification treatments, with the macrophyte response being most notable because it was opposite to that of E. canadensis. Native macrophytes decreased in biomass in browner water, where they represented about 40 % of total biomass compared to 85 % in clear water. In regression analyses, E. canadensis length RGR was best predicted only by water color treatment, but biomass RGR and biomass per length were inversely correlated with native macrophyte biomass, which is consistent with competition. Our results unexpectedly showed water brownification to have more influence on lake invasion than climate warming at this temperature regime. Two pathways emerged for climate to interact with biological invasions in structuring novel communities: directly, if non-native species respond positively to climate change, and indirectly through species interactions, for instance, because water brownification impairs growth of native macrophytes and reduces biotic resistance to invasion. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Water brownification may increase the invasibility of a submerged non-native macrophyte,Biological Invasions,10.1007/s10530-012-0216-y

It is widely believed that environmental degradation of streams and rivers may facilitate susceptibility to invasion; however, this has not yet been demonstrated consistently across a wide range of taxonomic groups. We analyzed macroinvertebrate data from 398 stream and river sites in Germany in order to test whether morphologically and physicochemically degraded stream and river habitats are more prone to invasion. Further, we identified the most important environmental variables facilitating invasion. The study confirmed that invaded sites were significantly more degraded than sites where only indigenous species were recorded. In both streams and rivers, invaded sites featured increased maximum temperatures, chloride and total organic carbon concentrations and a decreased morphological habitat quality. In streams, additionally the variables minimum temperature, oxygen, orthophosphate and ammonium contributed to greater degradation. In rivers also nitrate concentration was increased at invaded sites. Generalized linear models indicated that chloride was one of the most important variables that favored invasibility in both streams and rivers. In streams, the most indicative variables for invasion risk also included orthophosphate and maximum temperature. In rivers, in addition to chloride, morphological habitat quality was important. Our results confirm that the physicochemical and morphological intactness of riverine systems is a safeguard against invasion of aquatic non-indigenous macroinvertebrates. Based on this knowledge, management strategies can be developed to reduce invasion risk. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Physicochemical and morphological degradation of stream and river habitats increases invasion risk,Biological Invasions,10.1007/s10530-012-0226-9

The non-native seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla has proliferated on estuarine mudflats throughout the southeastern US, including areas (South Carolina and Georgia) that historically were extremely low in seaweed biomass. Quantitative field surveys across 150 km of high salinity estuaries revealed that the density of the native onuphid polychaete Diopatra cuprea and the aboveground height of its biogenic tubes, which Diopatra decorates with drifting debris and seaweed, positively influenced Gracilaria biomass. The abundance of Gracilaria epifauna, composed primarily of amphipods and small snails, increased with Gracilaria biomass at many locations in our field surveys. To examine whether epifauna were facilitated by Gracilaria we experimentally manipulated Gracilaria biomass in two locations. Consistent with the field surveys, we found that increasing Gracilaria biomass facilitated epifauna, particularly amphipods and snails. Epifaunal densities on Gracilaria were higher than on a biologically-inert structural mimic of Gracilaria (plastic aquarium alga), indicating that epifauna colonize Gracilaria because Gracilaria provisions both physical structure and a biological resource. We also quantified the seaweed's net rate of productivity and decomposition. Primary production of Gracilaria was variable, but massive in some areas (up to 200 % net biomass increase in 8 weeks). The seaweed rapidly degraded upon burial in silty sediments (79 % loss in mass within 10 days) and thus may represent an important new addition to detrital foodwebs. As a copious, novel source of primary production, detritus, and desirable habitat for epifauna, Gracilaria has the potential to transform southeastern US estuaries. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Impacts of an abundant introduced ecosystem engineer within mudflats of the southeastern US coast,Biological Invasions,10.1007/s10530-012-0254-5

Here, we provide an update on the ornamental crayfish trade approximately one decade after the crayfish hype to explore the long-term implications in terms of bio-invasion risk. Specifically, species availability in e-commerce and potential invasiveness were assessed and compared to previous studies. Morphological and ecological traits of the offered species were compiled and related to their long-term availability (covering 20052015). In July 2015, a total of 31 online shops offered 28 crayfish species, which represents a decline of 24 % in species diversity compared to the late 2000s. The estimated rate of import of new species has considerably flattened and approaches pre-hype values (<1 species year-1). However, the risk associated with the offered species, as assessed by a risk screening tool, has not decreased compared to the late 2000s. Long-term availability in the trade was primarily determined by bright coloration, the ability to reproduce under warm aquarium conditions, and a preference for lentic habitats. Species featuring such traits are likely to persist in the aquarium trade and include four high-risk species, most notably invasive and crayfish plague-carrying red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and Marmorkrebs (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis).

At the same time, we show that management can reverse invader impacts, notably reclaiming thermoregulatory opportunities for ectotherms, thus offering benefits as well as challenges for such animals.

Potential source regions under future climate conditions are identified, and species from those emerging risk areas are identified. We use dynamically downscaled climate projections to complement global analyses and provide fine-scale projections of suitable climate for current and future (20702099) conditions at the regional scale. Changing climatic conditions may reduce the suitability for some invasive species and improve it for others. Invasive species with distributions strongly determined by climate, where the projected future climate is highly suitable, are those with the greatest potential to be future invasive species in the region. As the Alps region becomes warmer and drier, many more regions of the world become potential sources of invasive species, although only one additional species of Hawkweed is identified as an emerging risk. However, in the longer term, as the species in these areas respond to global climate change, the potential source areas contract again to match higher altitude regions.

The selective obstacle height (SOH) for goldfish was 81.2 cm, the estimated maximum height that the tip of a jumping goldfish could reach. Facility designs (whether culvert, weir or fish pass) with this SOH criterion guarantees complete migration failure of goldfish. Also, most (9599%) of the barbels migrating populations will surpass the SOH regardless of body length; only the less capable or those in poor condition will be blocked.

Following preliminary genetic analyses that revealed a second, possibly undescribed Euglandina species was probably introduced to Hawaii, we used an integrative systematic approach combining both genetic and morphological assessments to examine the taxonomic status of the snail referred to as E. rosea in Hawaii. Genetic and morphological analyses support the interpretation that two Euglandina species were introduced to and have become established in Hawaii and can be readily distinguished based on morphological differences.

We hypothesized that period after separation from maternal clumps and propagule size, both influence the capacity of C. edulis to establish and develop new vegetative structures. With this objective, we separate apical fragments with two different sizes that were sown under greenhouse conditions after a sequence of storing time. We further examined morphological and physiological attributes as survival, length growth and biomass, FW/DW ratio, relative water content and leaf hydration, osmolarity and fluorescence. Biochemical parameters were also included through the measurement of phenol and tannin content together with photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylla,b and carotenoids) and derived ratios. After 2 months, apical propagules did not show signs of morphological, physiological or biochemical deterioration with increasing storing periods. Propagules showed improved or at least similar performance after storing for longer periods, with slight or no differences between different sized propagules in morphological or physiological values as indicated by the absence of enhanced leaf water status, the maintenance of photosynthetic efficiency (high Fv/Fm values) and the stability in photosynthetic pigments content. Our results indicate that the growth of C. edulis propagules is not significantly constrained during the first month after disconnection, no matter the size of apical fragment considered.

Many catastrophic invasions of both natural and agricultural systems have been initiated through anthropogenic dissemination pathways. Phytophthora species are a group of invasive plant pathogens causing many of the most important plant disease epidemics. A review of Phytophthora species descriptions published following the publication of the first DNA-based Phytophthora phylogeny was conducted to highlight patterns of recent introductions and to provide insights for early pathogen detection initiatives. Seventy-two publications from 2001 to 2016 describing 98 Phytophthora species were evaluated. Of the 91 species with data on geographic location isolation, 22% were described from type specimens isolated from urban environments, 33% from agricultural environments and 45% from natural environments. Within the urban environment, ornamental plant trading nurseries were the most important sources. Specifically, for Phytophthora ramorum, a species causing multiple epidemics globally, the largest proportion of first report publications were from urban environments, including nurseries. We therefore suggest that detection programs for invasive plant pathogens within the urban environment would be valuable. In this regard, specialized monitoring and citizen science projects that target urban areas where live plant-trading industries are concentrated would be particularly effective to both promote early detection and to facilitate a rapid response to new species invasions.",Urban environments provide opportunities for early detections of Phytophthora invasions,Biological Invasions,10.1007/s10530-017-1585-z

However, single individuals were found on four occasions during the first half of the 20 th century, and in 1951 a small population was discovered breeding on several rocky islets in north-east Bermuda. Recovery actions began in 1962 when the population numbered just 18 pairs, dispersed among five small islets. Although rats extirpated one of these five colonies in 1967, the population has grown steadily to 56 breeding pairs in 2000. We investigated the breeding phenology, productivity and population size of the Bermuda Petrel between 2000/2001 and 2007/2008. Each year, the birds began arriving in Bermuda around mid-October. They departed on a pre-breeding exodus between 19 November and 14 December, returning after 32-56 days to lay a single egg between 31 December and 31 January. Eggs hatched from 16 February to 26 March after a mean (± SD) incubation period of 53 ± 2 days, and young fledged from 15 May to 25 June after a mean fledging period of 91 ± 5 days. Between 2000/2001 and 2007/2008, reproductive output ranged from 29 to 40 fledglings per annum. Mean annual breeding success (62%) was reasonably high relative to other Procellariiformes, largely due to the provision of artificial (concrete) nesting burrows. In 2008, the population numbered 85 breeding pairs. Monitoring since 1961 indicates the population has been increasing exponentially, doubling approximately every 22 years. This rate of increase, together with the increased incidence of storm damage, is making it progressively more impracticable to construct sufficient concrete burrows on the current nesting islets to accommodate all breeding pairs. The vulnerability of these sites to accelerating storm damage and erosion as a result of anthropomorphic climate change is now the greatest threat to the Bermuda Petrel. © Copyright BirdLife International 2012.",Breeding biology and population increase of the Endangered Bermuda Petrel Pterodroma cahow,Bird Conservation International,10.1017/S0959270911000396
811,general,The economic cost of seabird bycatch in Argentinean longline fisheries,Patricia Gandini and Esteban Frere,birdconservationinternational,2012,2012,3,Source of mechanism,4,Testing response,NA,5,1.074,"Seabird mortality in longline fisheries is believed to be an important cause of the reductions in many seabird populations worldwide, and results in reduced fishing efficiency and economic losses for fishing companies. We estimated the economic cost of not using seabird bycatch deterrents in Argentinean longline fisheries, with the intention of encouraging adoption of mitigation measures in those fisheries. We conducted the study in the Argentine ling Genypterus blacodes and Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides fisheries from 2001 to 2006 on three fishing vessels. Data on the incidence of seabird bycatch were collected by seabird observers specially trained in seabird identification and data on the catch rates of target species, cost of bait and fish were provided by the fishing company, supervised by Federal Inspectors from the Provincial Fisheries Agency. To estimate the bait loss, we set lines both with and without the use of deterrents (streamer lines, night setting and strategic discharge of offal) in both fisheries. Seabird bycatch varies temporally and geographically, so to estimate economic losses using deterrents in each fishery, we used different bycatch rates/1000 hooks registered for different periods and fishing areas. Bycatch rates in the absence of deterrents were two birds/1000 hooks and 1.53 birds/1000 hooks for the Patagonian toothfish and ling fisheries, respectively. These rates equate to the loss of more than 1.5 and 2 million dollars over a 10 year period for each fishery. When estimations are made with lower mortality rates, economic losses declined abruptly and were in the order of hundreds of dollars/fishing trip, for the same period of time. Results show that using deterrents, long term profits for the fishing company increase at a considerably high rate (the decrease in monetary loss is an order of magnitude), and the mortality of seabirds decreases by the same proportion (CPUE of seabirds decreases from tens of thousands to a few hundred). In these fisheries, the use of mitigation measures that reduce bait loss and seabird mortality represents a win-win situation with benefits to conservation and fishing companies. © Copyright BirdLife International 2011.",The economic cost of seabird bycatch in Argentinean longline fisheries,Bird Conservation International,10.1017/S0959270911000219

In an environment under a high level of threat, the high breeding site fidelity (or breeding site persistence) of this species enables long term monitoring of colony site occupancy, colony size and other breeding parameters, which provide multiple indicators of population status. We surveyed known colony sites and searched for new sites in three recent breeding seasons in order to assess the current population status in the most important part of their range in Sierra Leone, the Gola Forest. We found 157 active nests at 40 colonies, equating to at least 314 adult birds. Less than half of the known colonies were protected by the Gola Forest Reserve. Colonies outside the reserve tended to be confined to larger rocks and subject to disturbance from human activities in close proximity, but did not have fewer active nests in them. Colonies outside the reserve were also more likely to be inactive in a given year whereas all colonies inside the reserve were active in every survey year. A predictive distribution model indicated that the survey region could have as many as 234 nests equating to at least 468 breeding birds. There was no evidence that mean colony size had declined since surveys undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s but it was not possible to compare colony abandonment rates inside and outside the reserve over that time period. Clutch and brood sizes were similar in each year, though brood size appeared slightly lower in the third survey year possibly because of a slightly later survey date. Mean clutch and brood sizes reported during the study period were similar to those found in the 1980s and 1990s. We conclude that the population of White-necked Picathartes in the Gola Forest area has been relatively stable over the last two decades, reflecting both the efficacy of protection afforded by the Gola Forest Reserve and presumably low pressure to farm new areas in the nearby community forest. However, regular monitoring of colonies both inside and outside the reserve is required to detect any systematic impact on the birds as pressure for land increases. © 2011 BirdLife International.",Long term stability of White-necked Picathartes population in south-east Sierra Leone,Bird Conservation International,10.1017/S0959270911000220

Recently, overall forest cover in Vietnam has increased, but most of the increase has been attributed to plantations of non-native trees. The conservation value of these plantations for birds is unknown. We compared avian species richness in pine plantations to that in second-growth and mature native forests in Tam Dao National Park, Vietnam. Bird species were classified into two categories: forest specialists or forest generalists. To account for strong heterogeneity in detection probabilities, the number of species in each category was estimated using the Pledger-Huggins estimator. We estimated total species richness and number of forest specialist species to be highest in mature forest (191; 95% CI = 96, 287, and 88; 95% CI = 47, 129 respectively), lower in second-growth forest (158; 95% CI = 87, 245 and 58; 95% CI = 18, 98 respectively), and lowest in pine plantation (106; 95% CI = 52, 158 and 49; 95% CI = 2, 97 respectively).

Three main wintering regions were identified: the Moghan Plain in the north-west of the country, the Turkmen Sahra Plain at the south-east corner of the Caspian Sea and the Sarakhs Plain in the north-east, close to the Afghan border. Up to 10,050 individuals were counted in winter 2009 in the Moghan Plain, which was recognised as the most important area for wintering Little Bustards in Iran. The species was also found in good numbers in Miankaleh, Gomishan, Soufikam, Shour Lake and Sarakhs. Flocks comprising 51 to 500 individuals were the most commonly observed and represented 32% of occurrences. A marked increase in wintering population size was noted in recent years.

The smallest home ranges were recorded in April-June (incubation and nesting period) with a significant increase in July-August (fledging season). The most important foraging habitat during the entire breeding season was grassland (especially pastures) reaching 90% for all locations. Vegetation height and cover were the main factors determining habitat selection: Little Owls significantly preferred sparse and short sward vegetation patches that enabled hunting of ground-dwelling prey.

Here we compare nesting success of the Reed Parrotbill Paradoxornis heudei in annually harvested and non-harvested reedbed habitats in the Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve in China, by recording the number of nestlings produced per nest and the causes of nest failure. We modelled daily nest survival rate (DSR) by considering the effects of harvesting, vegetation characteristics, year, date, advancement within the breeding season, nest age and nearest-nest distance, using the program MARK. Nest densities, but not the number of fledglings per nest, were significantly lower in harvested than non-harvested reedbed habitats. The best-fit DSR model estimated constant survival; none of the tested co-variables had significant effects. Moreover, harvesting did not affect the date of breeding initiation, likelihood of nest failure, or causes of nest failure, as vegetation cover was not significantly different between harvested and non-harvested reedbeds during the whole breeding season. Nest failure following adverse weather conditions was unusually common in harvested and non-harvested reedbeds, accounting for as many nest failures as depredation. However, comparisons with other studies suggest that deriving a conclusion on the impact of harvesting on nesting success is not straightforward and is probably linked to environmental characteristics affecting reed growth. © 2011 BirdLife International.","Reproductive success of the threatened Reed Parrotbill Paradoxornis heudei in non-harvested and harvested reedbeds in the Yangtze River estuary, China",Bird Conservation International,10.1017/S0959270911000384

We recorded 44 nesting attempts in seven tree species, with most nests (95%) being located in live canopy trees > 60 cm DBH. Most parrot nest-cavities occurred in Blepharocalix salicifolius (60%) and cavities in this species were selected significantly more than expected based on availability. Nests were shallower and higher than nests of other Amazona species. For all years combined, mean nest density of Tucuman Parrot was 0.24 ± 0.04 nest ha-1 and the distance to the nearest active nest was significantly greater than the distance between all trees used as nests. Nesting pairs of Tucuman Parrot were separated by 144.1 ± 152.8 m, while potential nest-trees were 66.0 ± 55.4 m apart. Density of suitable cavities for nesting was 4.6 cavities ha-1. Approximately 16 suitable cavities were available for each breeding pair (0.24 breeding pair ha-1 and four suitable cavities ha-1) and 5% of the suitable cavities available were occupied, suggesting that suitable cavities are not a limiting resource.

The most abundant species were Turkey Vulture Cathartes aura, Swainson's Hawk Buteo swainsoni, Broad-winged Hawk Buteo platypterus, Wood Stork Mycteria americana, American White Pelican Pelecanus erythrothynchos, Franklin's Gull Leucophaeus pipixcan, and American Kestrel Falco sparverius. In spring, the seasonal average magnitude of migration was over 28,000 birds, while in autumn the average was over one million. The aggregated seasonal phenologies recorded illustrate a variety of migration patterns. The inter-annual variation is lower in autumn than in spring. Migrating raptors and other soaring birds did not seem to use any topographical feature as a leading line for their movements in spring, while in autumn they did. We estimated the main axis of spring flights to run along a SE-NW vector, while autumn migration follows a WNW-ESE general trajectory.

Recognising and enhancing the value of biodiversity outside, as well as inside, protected areas is increasingly important given recognition that biodiversity targets will not be met through protected areas alone. We investigated the extent to which protection influences colony occupancy and colony size of a species of conservation concern, the rock-nesting White-necked Picathartes Picathartes gymnocephalus. We used mixed models to compare long term trends at 42 colonies located both inside and outside a protected area of forest, Gola Rainforest National Park, and considered colonies further inside the boundary as being better protected. Colony occupation was primarily predicted by the level of protection, with occupation highest within protected areas, but was not different between colonies situated close to or far from the boundary. Mean colony occupation was consistently high in protected areas, and lower in unprotected areas. The surface area of colony rocks was also an important predictor with larger rock faces having a higher probability of occupancy. Our best models also included distance to forested habitat, presence of cleared forest and evidence of hunting as less important predictors. Over the eight-year study, after controlling for rock surface area, active colony size declined significantly. However, declines were only significant in colonies in unprotected forest, whilst colonies located within protected areas were buffered from significant decline. Together this suggests colony occupancy and the number of active nests are influenced by protection and human disturbance. Although a lack of demographic and population dynamic work on picathartes prevents identifying mechanisms, we show that despite unprotected colonies having lower occupancy and fewer active nests they can persist in human altered and disturbed areas, partly because larger traditionally used rocks remain important nesting sites.","The importance of protected and unprotected areas for colony occupancy and colony size in White-necked Picathartes Picathartes gymnocephalus in and around Gola Rainforest National Park, Sierra Leone",Bird Conservation International,10.1017/S0959270916000113

The area is of particular global importance for the 'Critically Endangered' Spoon-billed Sandpiper Calidris pygmaea (peak count across all three study sites: 62 in spring [2015] and 225 in autumn [2014] and 'Endangered' Spotted Greenshank Tringa guttifer (peak count across all three study sites: 210 in spring [2014] and 1,110 in autumn [2015]). The southern Jiangsu coast is therefore currently the most important migratory stopover area in the world, in both spring and autumn, for both species. Several serious and acute threats to waterbirds were recorded at these study sites. Paramount is the threat of large-scale land claim which would completely destroy intertidal mudflats of critical importance to waterbirds. Degradation of intertidal mudflat habitats through the spread of invasive Spartina, and mortality of waterbirds by entrapment in nets or deliberate poisoning are also real and present serious threats here. Collisions with, and displacement by, wind turbines and other structures, and industrial chemical pollution may represent additional potential threats. We recommend the rapid establishment of effective protected areas for waterbirds in the study area, maintaining large areas of open intertidal mudflat, and the urgent removal of all serious threats currently faced by waterbirds here.","The intertidal wetlands of southern Jiangsu Province, China - Globally important for Spoon-billed Sandpipers and other threatened waterbirds, but facing multiple serious threats",Bird Conservation International,10.1017/S0959270917000223

These impacts often differ depending on species-specific characteristics. Range data on forest dependent bird species from the South African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP1 and SABAP2) were analysed to determine links between deforestation, species characteristics and range declines. Half of the species studied were found to have declining ranges. Range change data for these species were correlated with data on changes in land cover from 1990 to 2014. To determine which land cover changes affect extinction, occupancy was modelled for 30 sites across South Africa which experienced a loss of more than 10 species. Most species lost were birds of prey or insectivores. Indigenous forest decreased in 17% (n = 5) sites, while plantations/woodlots decreased in 60% (n = 18) sites. Occupancy modelling showed extinction to be mitigated by plantations in 6/28 species, and forest expansion mitigated extinction in 7/28 species. Responses to deforestation did not appear to be related to particular species characteristics. Half of South Africa's forest-dependent bird species have declining ranges, with the loss of these species most prominent in the Eastern Cape province. Four responses to changes in forest and plantation cover are discussed: direct effects, with forest loss causing species loss; matrix effects, where plantation loss resulted in species loss; degradation of indigenous forest; and the advent of new forest arising from woody thickening caused by carbon fertilisation, which may not result in optimal habitat for forest-dependent birds.",Atlas data indicate forest dependent bird species declines in South Africa,Bird Conservation International,10.1017/S095927091600040X

To determine the status, nest site selection, and breeding parameters, data were collected at Chetaïbi, north-east Algeria in 2010 and 2012. During this period, the number of breeding pairs decreased from 130 to 100, which represents an annual decrease rate of 12.29%. The mean clutch size was 2.6 ± 0.5 (n = 90) and 2.9 ± 0.4 (n = 34) in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Clutches displayed a low rate of hatching (56% and 41%) and productivity decreased from 0.8 chicks/nest in 2010 to 0.4 chicks/nest in 2012. Breeding outcome and productivity were negatively related to sun exposure and were weakly linked to hatching date in 2012 but not in 2010. Although fluctuations in population size have been reported across the species breeding range, our results suggest that the Algerian population of Eleonoras Falcon is experiencing a sharp decline in recent times that also involves the near extinction of a small neighbouring colony. Apart from the effect of environmental factors on breeding performance, this negative population trend is likely to be explained by increasing anthropogenic pressures associated with an upsurge of recreational activities on and around the island as well as the introduction of mammal predators.

Climate change makes the consideration of the dynamics of ecological processes in the design of marine protected areas critical. We analyzed sea-surface temperature (SST) trends and variability in Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) for 25 years and formulated and tested whether three sets of notional conservation objectives were met to illustrate the potential for planning to address climate change. Given mixed and limited evidence that no-take areas increase resilience to disturbances such as anomalously high temperatures (i.e., temperatures =1 °C above weekly mean temperature), our conservation objectives focused on areas less likely to be affected by such events at extents ranging from the entire Great Barrier Reef to the system of no-take zones and individual no-take zones. The objective sets were (1) at least 50% of temperature refugia (i.e., pixels that had high-temperature anomalies <5% or <7% of the time) within no-take zones, (2) maximum occurrence of high-temperature anomalies is <10%,< 20%, or <30% of total no-take area 90% of the time, and (3) coverage of any single no-take zone by high-temperature anomalies occurs <5% or <10% of the time. We used satellite imagery from 1985-2009 to measure SST to determine high-temperature anomalies. SSTs in the Great Barrier Reef increased significantly in some regions, and some of the conservation objectives were met by the park's current zoning plan.

Sears and Peter Stiling and Jason R. Rohr,conservationbiology,2012,2012,2,Threatening mechanism,1,Proposing a response,NA,16,4.355,"Some species have insufficient defenses against climate change, emerging infectious diseases, and non-native species because they have not been exposed to these factors over their evolutionary history, and this can decrease their likelihood of persistence. Captive breeding programs are sometimes used to reintroduce individuals back into the wild; however, successful captive breeding and reintroduction can be difficult because species or populations often cannot coexist with non-native pathogens and herbivores without artificial selection. In captive breeding programs, breeders can select for host defenses that prevent or reduce pathogen or herbivore burden (i.e., resistance) or traits that limit the effects of parasitism or herbivory on host fitness (i.e., tolerance). We propose that selection for host tolerance may enhance the success of reintroduction or translocation because tolerant hosts generally have neutral effects on introduced pathogens and herbivores. The release of resistant hosts would have detrimental effects on their natural enemies, promoting rapid evolution to circumvent the host resistance that may reduce the long-term probability of persistence of the reintroduced or translocated species. We examined 2 case studies, one on the pathogenic amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis [Bd]) and the other on the herbivorous cactus moth (Cactoblastis cactorum) in the United States, where it is not native. In each case study, we provide recommendations for how captive breeders and managers could go about selecting for host tolerance. Selecting for tolerance may offer a promising tool to rescue hosts species from invasive natural enemies as well as new natural enemies associated with climate change-induced range shifts. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.",Selecting for Tolerance against Pathogens and Herbivores to Enhance Success of Reintroduction and Translocation,Conservation Biology,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01854.x

Seabirds typically nest colonially and show strong fidelity to natal colonies, and such colonies on low-lying islands may be threatened by sea-level rise. We used French Frigate Shoals, the largest atoll in the Hawaiian Archipelago, as a case study to explore the population dynamics of seabird colonies and the potential effects sea-level rise may have on these rookeries. We compiled historic observations, a 30-year time series of seabird population abundance, lidar-derived elevations, and aerial imagery of all the islands of French Frigate Shoals. To estimate the population dynamics of 8 species of breeding seabirds on Tern Island from 1980 to 2009, we used a Gompertz model with a Bayesian approach to infer population growth rates, density dependence, process variation, and observation error. All species increased in abundance, in a pattern that provided evidence of density dependence. Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor), Masked Boobies (Sula dactylatra), Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda), Spectacled Terns (Onychoprion lunatus), and White Terns (Gygis alba) are likely at carrying capacity. Density dependence may exacerbate the effects of sea-level rise on seabirds because populations near carrying capacity on an island will be more negatively affected than populations with room for growth. We projected 12% of French Frigate Shoals will be inundated if sea level rises 1 m and 28% if sea level rises 2 m. Spectacled Terns and shrub-nesting species are especially vulnerable to sea-level rise, but seawalls and habitat restoration may mitigate the effects of sea-level rise. Losses of seabird nesting habitat may be substantial in the Hawaiian Islands by 2100 if sea levels rise 2 m.

We also evaluated the possible effects of competition between P. annua and 2 vascular plants native to Antarctica, Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) and Antarctic hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica). We grew the native species in experimental plots with and without annual bluegrass under conditions that mimicked the Antarctic environment. After 5 months, we measured photosynthetic performance on the basis of chlorophyll fluorescence and determined total biomass of both native species. We found individual specimens of annual bluegrass at 3 different sites on the Antarctic Peninsula during the 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 austral summers. The presence of bluegrass was associated with a statistically significant reduction in biomass of pearlwort and hairgrass, whereas the decrease in biomass of bluegrass was not statistically significant. Similarly, the presence of bluegrass significantly reduced the photosynthetic performance of the 2 native species. Sites where bluegrass occurred were close to major maritime routes of scientific expeditions and of tourist cruises to Antarctica.

New models of climate change and species distribution and new methods of conservation planning now make it possible to explore the uncertainties associated with climate changes and species responses. Yet few reliable estimates of the costs of expanding protected areas and methods for determining these costs exist, largely because of the many (and uncertain) determinants of these costs. We developed a cost-accounting model to estimate the range in costs of various options for expanding protected areas and to explore the variables that drive these costs. Model development was informed by an existing plan to expand protected areas in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa to address species conservation under a scenario of climate change. The 50-year present value of total costs varied from US$260 million ($1077/ha) for an off-reserve option that involves agreements with landowners and no compensation of forgone production and associated revenue to $1020 million ($4228/ha) for an on-reserve option that involves land acquisition and protection. The costs of acquiring land or compensating landowners for forgone production and development opportunities were the major drivers of the total costs across all options because most of the area identified in the protected-area expansion plan consisted of urban and high-quality agricultural lands. Total costs were also affected by changes in protected area extent and discount rate.

We analyzed data from a 17-year study of the distribution of the non-native Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) and the native winter ant (Prenolepis imparis) in a preserve in northern California (U.S.A.). We conducted logistic regressions and used model selection to determine whether the following variables were associated with changes in the distribution of each species: presence of conspecifics at neighboring sites, distance to development (e.g., roads, buildings, and landscaped areas), proportion of vegetation cover taller than 0.75 m, elevation, distance to water, presence of both species at a site, temperature, and rainfall. Argentine ants colonized unoccupied sites from neighboring sites, but the probability of appearance and persistence decreased as distance to development, vegetation cover, and elevation increased. Winter ants appeared and persisted in sites with relatively high vegetation cover (i.e., highly shaded sites). Presence of the 2 species was negatively associated in sites with high vegetation cover (more winter ants) and sites near development (more Argentine ants). Probability of colonization of Argentine ants decreased where winter ants were most persistent. At sites near development within the preserve, abundant Argentine ant populations may be excluding winter ants. The high abundance of Argentine ants at these sites may be due to immigration from suburban areas outside the preserve, which are high-quality habitat for Argentine ants. In the interior of the preserve, distance from development, low-quality habitat, and interaction with winter ants may in combination exclude Argentine ants.

We explored the influence of data resolution on prioritization of Finnish forests with Zonation, a software program that ranks the priority of cells in a landscape for conservation. We used data on the distribution of different forest types that were aggregated to nine different resolutions ranging from 0.1 × 0.1 km to 25.6 × 25.6 km. We analyzed data at each resolution with two variants of Zonation that had different criteria for prioritization, with and without accounting for connectivity and with and without adjustment for the effect on the analysis of edges between areas at the project boundary and adjacent areas for which data do not exist. Spatial overlap of the 10% of cells ranked most highly when data were analyzed at different resolutions varied approximately from 15% to 60% and was greatest among analyses with similar resolutions. Inclusion of connectivity or edge adjustment changed the location of areas that were prioritized for conservation. Even though different locations received high priority for conservation in analyses with and without accounting for connectivity, accounting for connectivity did not reduce the representation of different forest types. Inclusion of connectivity influenced most the outcome of fine-resolution analyses because the connectivity extents that we based on dispersal distances of typical forest species were small. When we kept the area set aside for conservation constant, representation of the forest types increased as resolution increased. We do not think it is necessary to avoid use of high-resolution data in spatial conservation prioritization.

We evaluated the trade-off among sustainable food production, profitability, and conservation objectives in the groundfish bottom-trawl fishery off the U.S. West Coast, where depletion (i.e., reduction in abundance) of six rockfish species (Sebastes) is of particular concern. Trade-offs are inherent in this multispecies fishery because there is limited capacity to target species individually. From population models and catch of 34 stocks of bottom fish, we calculated the relation between harvest rate, long-term yield (i.e., total weight of fish caught), profit, and depletion of each species. In our models, annual ecosystem-wide yield from all 34 stocks was maximized with an overall 5.4% harvest rate, but profit was maximized at a 2.8% harvest rate. When we reduced harvest rates to the level (2.2% harvest rate) at which no stocks collapsed (<10% of unfished levels), biomass harvested was 76% of the maximum sustainable yield and profit 89% of maximum. A harvest rate under which no stocks fell below the biomass that produced maximum sustainable yield (1% harvest rate), resulted in 45% of potential yield and 67% of potential profit. Major reductions in catch in the late 1990s led to increase in the biomass of the most depleted stocks, but this rebuilding resulted in the loss of >30% of total sustainable yield, whereas yield lost from stock depletion was 3% of total sustainable yield.

In doing so, they allow one to identify influential nodes that are not well studied empirically so that future research can be prioritized. We identified relationships in host and pathogen biology to examine disease-driven declines of amphibians associated with amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). We constructed a Bayesian network consisting of behavioral, genetic, physiological, and environmental variables that influence disease and used them to predict host population trends. We varied the impacts of specific variables in the model to reveal factors with the most influence on host population trend. The behavior of the nodes (the way in which the variables probabilistically responded to changes in states of the parents, which are the nodes or variables that directly influenced them in the graphical model) was consistent with published results. The frog population had a 49% probability of decline when all states were set at their original values, and this probability increased when body temperatures were cold, the immune system was not suppressing infection, and the ambient environment was conducive to growth of B. dendrobatidis. These findings suggest the construction of our model reflected the complex relationships characteristic of hostpathogen interactions. Changes to climatic variables alone did not strongly influence the probability of population decline, which suggests that climate interacts with other factors such as the capacity of the frog immune system to suppress disease. Changes to the adaptive immune system and disease reservoirs had a large effect on the population trend, but there was little empirical information available for model construction. Our model inputs can be used as a base to examine other systems, and our results show that such analyses are useful tools for reviewing existing literature, identifying links poorly supported by evidence, and understanding complexities in emerging infectious-disease systems.",Using a Bayesian network to clarify areas requiring research in a hostpathogen system,Conservation Biology,10.1111/cobi.12950

I developed a spatial econometric approach to propensity-score matching and used the approach to estimate the amount of habitat loss prevented by a grassland conservation easement program of the U.S. federal government. I used a spatial autoregressive probit model to predict tract enrollment in the easement program as of 2001 based on tract agricultural suitability, habitat quality, and spatial interactions among neighboring tracts. Using the predicted values from the model, I matched enrolled tracts with similar unenrolled tracts to form a treatment group and a control group. To measure the program's impact on subsequent grassland loss, I estimated cropland cultivation rates for both groups in 2014 with a second spatial probit model. Between 2001 and 2014, approximately 14.9% of control tracts were cultivated and 0.3% of treated tracts were cultivated. Therefore, approximately 14.6% of the protected land would have been cultivated in the absence of the program. My results demonstrate that conservation easements can significantly reduce habitat loss in agricultural regions; however, the enrollment of tracts with low cropland suitability may constrain the amount of habitat loss they prevent.

Yet, there is no clear-cut guidance on how genetic features can be incorporated into conservation-planning processes, despite multiple molecular markers and several genetic metrics for each marker type to choose from. Genetic patterns differ between species, but the potential tradeoffs among genetic objectives for multiple species in conservation planning are currently understudied. We compared spatial conservation prioritizations derived from 2 metrics of genetic diversity (nucleotide and haplotype diversity) and 2 metrics of genetic isolation (private haplotypes and local genetic differentiation) in mitochondrial DNA of 5 marine species. We compared outcomes of conservation plans based only on habitat representation with plans based on genetic data and habitat representation. Fewer priority areas were selected for conservation plans based solely on habitat representation than on plans that included habitat and genetic data. All 4 genetic metrics selected approximately similar conservation-priority areas, which is likely a result of prioritizing genetic patterns across a genetically diverse array of species. Largely, our results suggest that multispecies genetic conservation objectives are vital to creating protected-area networks that appropriately preserve community-level evolutionary patterns.",Multispecies genetic objectives in spatial conservation planning,Conservation Biology,10.1111/cobi.12875

Unlike other classes of vertebrates, however, small freshwater fishes appear to have an equal or greater risk of extinction than large fishes. We explored whether particular traits explain the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List conservation status of small-bodied freshwater fishes from 4 temperate river basins: Murray-Darling, Australia; Danube, Europe; Mississippi-Missouri, North America; and the Rio Grande, North America. Twenty-three ecological and life-history traits were collated for all 171 freshwater fishes of =120 mm total length. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to assess which combination of the 23 traits best explained whether a species was threatened or not threatened. We used the best models to predict the probability of 29 unclassified species being listed as threatened. With and without controlling for phylogeny at the family level, small body sizeamong small-bodied specieswas the most influential trait correlated with threatened species listings. The k-folds cross-validation demonstrated that body size and a random effect structure that included family predicted the threat status with an accuracy of 78% (SE 0.5). We identified 10 species likely to be threatened that are not listed as such on the IUCN Red List. Small body size is not a trait that provides universal resistance to extinction, particularly for vertebrates inhabiting environments affected by extreme habitat loss and fragmentation. We hypothesize that this is because small-bodied species have smaller home ranges, lower dispersal capabilities, and heightened ecological specialization relative to larger vertebrates. Trait data and further model development are needed to predict the IUCN conservation status of the over 11,000 unclassified freshwater fishes, especially those under threat from proposed dam construction in the world's most biodiverse river basins.",Trait-based prediction of extinction risk of small-bodied freshwater fishes,Conservation Biology,10.1111/cobi.12882

Conflict is inextricably linked to the ecological processes shaping relationships between pastoralists and native herbivores and carnivores. To elucidate relationships underpinning humanwildlife conflict, we synthesized 15 years of ecological and ethnographic data from Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in Mongolia's Gobi steppe. The density of argali (Ovis ammon), the world's largest wild sheep, at Ikh Nart was among the highest in Mongolia, yet livestock were >90% of ungulate biomass and dogs >90% of large-carnivore biomass. For argali, pastoral activities decreased food availability, increased mortality from dog predation, and potentially increased disease risk. Isotope analyses indicated that livestock accounted for >50% of the diet of the majority of gray wolves (Canis lupus) and up to 90% of diet in 25% of sampled wolves (n = 8). Livestock composed at least 96% of ungulate prey in the single wolf pack for which we collected species-specific prey data. Interviews with pastoralists indicated that wolves annually killed 14% of Ikh Nart's livestock, and pastoralists killed wolves in retribution. Pastoralists reduced wolf survival by killing them, but their livestock were an abundant food source for wolves. Consequently, wolf density appeared to be largely decoupled from argali density, and pastoralists had indirect effects on argali that could be negative if pastoralists increased wolf density (apparent competition) or positive if pastoralists decreased wolf predation (apparent facilitation). Ikh Nart's argali population was stable despite these threats, but livestock are increasingly dominant numerically and functionally relative to argali. To support both native wildlife and pastoral livelihoods, we suggest training dogs to not kill argali, community insurance against livestock losses to wolves, reintroducing key native prey species to hotspots of humanwolf conflict, and developing incentives for pastoralists to reduce livestock density.",Desert pastoralists negative and positive effects on rare wildlife in the Gobi,Conservation Biology,10.1111/cobi.12881

Geodiversity and species richness relationships have been demonstrated; establishing whether geodiversity relates to threatened species diversity and distribution pattern is a logical next step for conservation. We used 4 geodiversity variables (rock-type and soil-type richness, geomorphological diversity, and hydrological feature diversity) and 4 climatic and topographic variables to model threatened species diversity across 31 of Finland's national parks. We also analyzed rarity-weighted richness (a measure of site complementarity) of threatened vascular plants, fungi, bryophytes, and all species combined. Our 1-km2 resolution data set included 271 threatened species from 16 major taxa. We modeled threatened species richness (raw and rarity weighted) with boosted regression trees. Climatic variables, especially the annual temperature sum above 5 °C, dominated our models, which is consistent with the critical role of temperature in this boreal environment. Geodiversity added significant explanatory power. High geodiversity values were consistently associated with high threatened species richness across taxa. The combined effect of geodiversity variables was even more pronounced in the rarity-weighted richness analyses (except for fungi) than in those for species richness. Geodiversity measures correlated most strongly with species richness (raw and rarity weighted) of threatened vascular plants and bryophytes and were weakest for molluscs, lichens, and mammals. Although simple measures of topography improve biodiversity modeling, our results suggest that geodiversity data relating to geology, landforms, and hydrology are also worth including.

Although intact primary forests harbor many Himalayan birds during breeding, a large number of bird species use agricultural lands during winter. We assessed how Himalayan bird species richness, abundance, and composition during winter are affected by forest loss stemming from agriculture and grazing. Bird surveys along 12 elevational transects within primary forest, low-intensity agriculture, mixed subsistence agriculture, and intensively grazed pastures in winter revealed that bird species richness and abundance were greatest in low-intensity and mixed agriculture, intermediate in grazed pastures, and lowest in primary forest at both local and landscape scales; over twice as many species and individuals were recorded in low-intensity agriculture than in primary forest. Bird communities in primary forests were distinct from those in all other land-use classes, but only 4 species were unique to primary forests. Low-, medium-, and high-intensity agriculture harbored 32 unique species. Of the species observed in primary forest, 80% had equal or greater abundance in low-intensity agricultural lands, underscoring the value of these lands in retaining diverse community assemblages at high densities in winter. Among disturbed landscapes, bird species richness and abundance declined as land-use intensity increased, especially in high-intensity pastures. Our results suggest that agricultural landscapes are important for most Himalayan bird species in winter. But agricultural intensificationespecially increased grazingwill likely result in biodiversity losses. Given that forest reserves alone may inadequately conserve Himalayan birds in winter, comprehensive conservation strategies in the region must go beyond protecting intact primary forests and ensure that low-intensity agricultural lands are not extensively converted to high-intensity pastures.",The importance of agricultural lands for Himalayan birds in winter,Conservation Biology,10.1111/cobi.12812

Current approaches to connecting core conservation areas through corridors consider optimal corridor placement based on a single optimization goal: commonly, maximizing the movement for a target species across a network of protected areas. We show that designing corridors for single species based on purely ecological criteria leads to extremely expensive linkages that are suboptimal for multispecies connectivity objectives. Similarly, acquiring the least-expensive linkages leads to ecologically poor solutions. We developed algorithms for optimizing corridors for multispecies use given a specific budget. We applied our approach in western Montana to demonstrate how the solutions may be used to evaluate trade-offs in connectivity for 2 species with different habitat requirements, different core areas, and different conservation values under different budgets. We evaluated corridors that were optimal for each species individually and for both species jointly. Incorporating a budget constraint and jointly optimizing for both species resulted in corridors that were close to the individual species movement-potential optima but with substantial cost savings. Our approach produced corridors that were within 14% and 11% of the best possible corridor connectivity for grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolverines (Gulo gulo), respectively, and saved 75% of the cost. Similarly, joint optimization under a combined budget resulted in improved connectivity for both species relative to splitting the budget in 2 to optimize for each species individually. Our results demonstrate economies of scale and complementarities conservation planners can achieve by optimizing corridor designs for financial costs and for multiple species connectivity jointly. We believe that our approach will facilitate corridor conservation by reducing acquisition costs and by allowing derived corridors to more closely reflect conservation priorities.",Trade-offs and efficiencies in optimal budget-constrained multispecies corridor networks,Conservation Biology,10.1111/cobi.12814

In this study we use eight microsatellite markers to analyze population structure and gene flow patterns in the complete geographic range of the endangered rodent Ctenomys porteousi. Also, we use landscape genetics approaches to evaluate the effects of landscape configuration on the genetic connectivity among populations. In spite of geographical proximity of the sampling sites (8-27 km between the nearest sites) and the absence of marked barriers to individual movement, strong population structure and low values of gene flow were observed. Genetic differentiation among sampling sites was consistent with a simple model of isolation by distance, where peripheral areas showed higher population differentiation than those sites located in the central area of the species' distribution. Landscape genetics analysis suggested that habitat fragmentation at regional level has affected the distribution of genetic variation among populations. The distance of sampling sites to areas of the landscape having higher habitat connectivity was the environmental factor most strongly related to population genetic structure.

Natural landscape features are known to influence connectivity, but global anthropogenic landscape change underscores the importance of quantifying how human-modified landscapes disrupt connectivity of natural populations. Grasslands of western North America have experienced extensive habitat alteration, fragmenting populations of species such as black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Population sizes and the geographic range of prairie dogs have been declining for over a century due to habitat loss, disease, and eradication efforts. In many places, prairie dogs have persisted in the face of emerging urban landscapes that carve habitat into smaller and smaller fragments separated by uninhabitable areas. In extreme cases, prairie dog colonies are completely bounded by urbanization. Connectivity is particularly important for prairie dogs because colonies suffer high probabilities of extirpation by plague, and dispersal permits recolonization. Here we explore connectivity of prairie dog populations using analyses of 11 microsatellite loci for 9 prairie dog colonies spanning the fragmented landscape of Boulder County, Colorado. Isolation-by-resistance modeling suggests that wetlands and high intensity urbanization limit movement of prairie dogs. However, prairie dogs appear to move moderately well through low intensity development (including roads) and freely through cropland and grassland. Additionally, there is a marked decline in gene flow between colonies with increasing geographic distance, indicating isolation by distance even in an altered landscape. Our results suggest that prairie dog colonies retain some connectivity despite fragmentation by urbanization and agricultural development. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Connectivity of prairie dog colonies in an altered landscape: Inferences from analysis of microsatellite DNA variation,Conservation Genetics,10.1007/s10592-011-0293-y

The Sooglossidae are a family of frog species endemic to the Seychelles islands that are believed to have evolved in isolation for approximately 75 million years. Formerly thought to inhabit just two Seychelles islands (Mahé and Silhouette), a third population was discovered on Praslin in 2009. Phylogenetic analysis based on 438 bp of mitochondrial 16S rRNA suggests that the Praslin population is most closely related to Sooglossus sechellensis from Silhouette, and identifies these as two separate clades which together sit distinct from the population on Mahé. An average of 4. 06% uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence between the Praslin and Silhouette populations suggests substantial evolutionary divergence rather than recent introduction. Discriminant function analysis also revealed differences in morphology in frogs from Praslin and Mahé. DNA sequences of two Praslin specimens group more closely with the Mahé population, indicating some shared haplotypes that suggest recent secondary contact. Tests for a genetic signature of recent population expansion on either island were not significant. Our results suggest substantial evolutionary divergence between the three populations of S. sechellensis, most likely following isolation due to changes in sea level in the Indian Ocean. Whilst further genetic sampling and ecological studies are needed, our initial phylogenetic analyses suggest that the sooglossid population on Praslin should be managed as an evolutionarily significant unit to retain the uniqueness of its genetic diversity and its evolutionary trajectory within this ancient family of amphibians. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Evidence for evolutionary distinctiveness of a newly discovered population of sooglossid frogs on Praslin Island, Seychelles",Conservation Genetics,10.1007/s10592-011-0307-9

The Mauritius parakeet (Psittacula echo) has been the subject of an intensive conservation programme, involving translocation and reintroduction that has recovered the population from less than 20 individuals in 1987 to approximately 500 in 2010. Analysis of genotype data derived from 18 microsatellite markers developed for this species reveals a clear signal of structure in the population before intensive management began, but which subsequently disappears following management intervention.

Such a scenario may be playing out within Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister) metapopulations as a series of synergistic extrinsic pressures have contributed to the rangewide decline of the species over the last 40 years. Our goal was to elucidate the effects of demographic collapse on metapopulation function by using 11 microsatellites markers to quantify differences in patterns of connectivity and genetic diversity between a demographically stable metapopulation and one in severe demographic decline. The demographically diminished metapopulation had lower levels of genetic diversity than the stable metapopulation at all levels evaluated (metapopulation-, subpopulation-, and individual-scales). In contrast to patterns of connectivity observed within the stable metapopulation, peripheral subpopulations in the diminished metapopulation had become completely isolated and were drifting toward genetic fixation, likely as a result of the extirpation of stepping-stone subpopulations. The declining genetic parameters observed within these isolated peripheral subpopulations suggest that inbreeding depression may be contributing significantly to their demographic decline. Allegheny woodrats readily express the genetic consequences of metapopulation decline due to the low effective population sizes of subpopulations and the species' limited dispersal capacity. Differences in genetic parameters observed between demographically stable and diminished Allegheny woodrat metapopulations emphasize the risks posed to metapopulation function and associated genetic processes introduced with demographic decline. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Consequences of metapopulation collapse: Comparison of genetic attributes between two Allegheny woodrat metapopulations,Conservation Genetics,10.1007/s10592-012-0334-1

Additional analyses revealed (1) overall significant genetic structure; (2) a pattern of population differentiation consistent with a hypothesis of isolation by resistance (landscape connectivity), but not distance; and (3) relatively short dispersal distances indicated by elevated mean pairwise relatedness in several of the sites. Our results are somewhat surprising given the small geographic distances between sites (11-34 km) and the short time (~60 years) since wide-spread deforestation in this landscape. We suspect fine-scale genetic structure may occur in many resident tropical bird species, and in the case of the chestnut-backed antbird it appears that anthropogenic habitat fragmentation has important population genetic implications. It appears that chestnut-backed antbirds may persist in fragmented landscapes in the absence of significant migration among patches, but mechanisms that allow this species to persist when many other similar species do not are not well understood. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Fine-scale genetic population structure of an understory rainforest bird in Costa Rica,Conservation Genetics,10.1007/s10592-012-0341-2

Second, we quantify the degree of admixture and hybridization between two previously-unidentified divergent lineages within Belize. Third, we assess whether the existing group of marine protected areas (MPAs) in Belize protects this cryptic genetic diversity. The results provide strong evidence for two divergent genetic lineages of E. lori within Belize, separated geographically by only 30 km of low-suitability habitat. There is a sharp genetic cline across these 30 km, and evidence of admixture and introgression at the boundary regions of the habitat break.

In both time periods, replicate genetic sampling (n = 85; five sites) and field population surveys (93 sites) were conducted. We compared the distribution of parental species and hybrids and estimates for hybrid zone width and center between the two time periods. An increase in the relative proportion of Nelsons sparrows in sympatric marshes and an approximate doubling of hybrid zone width provides evidence for expansion. Introgression rates increased over time for neutral loci but declined for a mitochondrial gene and two gene-associated loci under the influence of selection, as expected under a speciation model with barriers to gene flow. On average, the center of the hybrid zone shifted 60 km southward over the 15 years. We placed our findings within a policy framework to evaluate management options for hybrids. We conclude that despite increasing rates of introgression, hybridization poses a substantially lesser threat to parental populations than the imminent consequences of sea-level rise and habitat degradation.

Although wild and managed bees are increasingly threatened by the degradation of natural habitats and climate change, risking plant biodiversity and agriculture production, no study has yet performed a systematic review of heritability estimates across the group. Here we help fill this knowledge gap, gathering all available heritability estimates for ants, bees, and wasps, evaluating which factors affect these estimates and assessing the reported genetic correlations between traits. Using a model selection approach to analyze a dataset of more than 800 heritability estimates, we found that heritability is influenced by trait type, with morphological traits exhibiting the highest heritability estimates, and defense and metabolism-related traits showing the lowest estimates. Study system, sociality degree, experimental design, estimation type (narrow or broad-sense heritability), and sample size were not found to affect heritability estimates. Results remained unaltered when correcting for phylogenetic inertia, and when analyzing social bees separately. Genetic correlations between honeybee traits revealed both positive coefficients, usually for traits in the same category, and negative coefficients, suggesting trade-offs among other traits. We discuss these findings and highlight the importance of maintaining genetic variance in fitness-related traits. Our study shows the importance of considering heritability estimates and genetic correlations when designing breeding and conservation programs.

Interestingly, more than one introduction event seems to have occurred with individuals from Lago Ercina and Pozos de Lloroza populations participating in the founding of the Peñalara population. Due to predation, competition and transmission of diseases enhanced by its ongoing expansion, I. alpestris population might be considered a threat to Peñalara biodiversity.

The study was centered in the Tambopata region of the Peruvian Amazon.

We analyzed 249 feathers using nine microsatellite loci and identified 221 unique genotypes. The remainder revealed 21 individuals which were recaptured one or more times. Using a capture-mark-recapture model the average number of different individuals visiting clay licks within one breeding season was estimated to fall between 84 and 316 individuals per clay lick. Analysis of population genetic structure revealed only small genetic differences among regions and clay licks, suggesting a single red-and-green macaw genetic population.

Landscape genetics can be used as a tool to predict disease emergence and spread. The Tasmanian devil is threatened with extinction by a nearly 100% fatal transmissible cancer, which has spread across 95% of the species geographic range in 20 years. Here, we present a landscape genetic analysis in the last remaining uninfected parts of the Tasmanian devils geographic range to: describe population genetic structure, characterize genetic diversity, and test the influence of landscape variables on Tasmanian devil gene flow to assess the potential for disease spread. In contrast to previous genetic studies on Tasmanian devils showing evidence for two genetic populations island-wide, our genetic based assignment tests and spatial principal components analyses suggest at least two, and possibly three, populations in a study area that is approximately 15% of the size of the overall species geographic range. Positive spatial autocorrelation declined at about 40 km, in contrast to 80 km in eastern populations, highlighting the need for range-wide genetic studies. Strong genetic structure was found between devils in the northern part of the study area and those found south of Macquarie Harbor, with weaker structure found between the northeastern and northwestern portion of our study area. Consistent with previous work, we found low overall genetic diversity, likely owing to a combination of founder effects and extreme weather events thousands of years ago that likely caused large-scale population declines. We also found possible signs of recent bottlenecks, perhaps resulting from forest clearing for dairy farming in the central part of the study area. This human disturbance also may have contributed to weak genetic structuring detected between the northeastern and northwestern part of the study area. Individual-based least cost path modeling showed limited influence of landscape variables on gene flow, with weak effects of variation in elevation in the northeast. In the northwest, however, landscape genetic models did not perform better than the null isolation-by-distance model. At the larger spatial scale of the northern part of the study area, elevation and temperatures were negatively correlated with gene flow, consistent with low dispersal suitability of higher elevation habitats that have lower temperatures and dense, wet vegetation. Overall, Tasmanian devils are a highly vagile species for which dispersal and gene flow appear to be influenced little by landscape features, and spread of devil facial tumor disease to the remaining portion of the devils geographic range seems imminent. Nonetheless, strong genetic structure found between the northern and southern portions of our study area, combined with low densities and limited possible colonization of DFTD from the east suggest there is some time for implementation of management strategies.",Landscape genetics of the Tasmanian devil: implications for spread of an infectious cancer,Conservation Genetics,10.1007/s10592-017-0980-4

Habitat loss and fragmentation can affect gene flow and the genetic structure of insect populations. Neoconocephalus bivocatus is a prairie obligate katydid found only in isolated prairie patches. We compared genetic diversity and population differentiation using AFLP markers in N. bivocatus and N. robustus, a grassland generalist that is not isolated to prairie fragments and occupies a more contiguous range. Similar levels of genetic diversity were present within populations of both species. While population genetic structure was found in both species, there was no relationship between assigned genotypes and sampling localities. This genetic structure may instead be evidence of a past barrier to gene flow that has since been removed. Genetic differentiation within both species was low, with no evidence of a correlation with geographic distance, indicating neither species is dispersal limited at these distances. We see no significant reduction in genetic diversity or genetic differentiation within N. bivocatus when compared to N. robustus. We therefore conclude that while N. bivocatus utilizes a fragmented landscape, long-distance dispersal likely maintains gene flow between isolated prairie patches.",Low genetic differentiation between populations of an endemic prairie katydid despite habitat loss and fragmentation,Conservation Genetics,10.1007/s10592-017-0987-x

Driven by perceived economic impacts to tourism and recreation, a strong response ensued, with education, monitoring and nascent biosecurity efforts based on similar measures in New Zealand. Considering the difficulty in containment (potential range on New Zealand's South Island was occupied by D. geminata within 3 years), the much larger potential range, and limited resources or previous experience in managing invaders in continental waters in South America, it is unlikely that current biosecurity measures will produce significant results. Lacking a coordinated strategic approach or conservation priorities, existing efforts may divert resources from alternatives with greater potential for success, while potentially feeding the public perception that the problem is being addressed.

Deforestation, which contributes a large proportion of total global emissions, must be avoided as an effective emissions-reduction tactic, and to alleviate biodiversity loss and poverty. However, incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) have had mixed and suboptimal success because of opportunity costs and administrative and technical issues, in particular, leakage, permanence, and additionality. We show that these latter concepts can be ambiguous, potentially contrived and in some cases, generate perverse outcomes. Encumbering avoided-deforestation projects with these administrative shackles risks massive increases in global deforestation and a concomitant loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services and emissions-reduction opportunities. We offer a solution built on a proven insurance-based hedging principle, a concept we call iREDD, that could indirectly address specific technical and administrative challenges, whether real or contrived. Project-specific iREDD insurance policies and premiums would be negotiated upfront using a simple assessment of risk based on governance quality, the integrity of management plans, liquidity, monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and political acceptability. iREDD acts as both an incentive for prudent forest management given the seller's potential financial windfall if forests are diligently managed, and guarantees not to disenfranchise the buyer. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","iREDD hedges against avoided deforestation's unholy trinity of leakage, permanence and additionality",Conservation Letters,10.1111/j.1755-263X.2012.00237.x

We compared 1990-2000 deforestation rates across: (1) protected areas; (2) unprotected areas sanctioned for conversion; and (3) unprotected production areas where commercial logging is permitted but conversion is not. Deforestation rates were lower in protected areas than in conversion areas (Mean: -19.8%; 95% C.I.: -29.7--10.0%; P < 0.001), but did not differ from production areas (Mean: -3.3%; 95% C.I.: -9.6-2.6%; P= 0.273). The measured protection impact of Sumatran protected areas differs with land use regulations governing unprotected lands used for comparisons.

This policy perspective examines if commercial value and markets could attract private sector investment to compensate for Government underspend on biodiversity conservation. It proposes trials in which landholders, community groups, and investors would have a form of wildlife ownership by leasing animals on land outside protected areas. They would be able to acquire threatened species from locally overabundant populations, breed them, innovate, and assist further colonization/range expansion while making a profit from the increase. The role of government would be to regulate, as is appropriate in a mixed economy, rather than be the (sole) owner and manager of wildlife. Wide application of the trials would not answer all biodiversity-loss problems, but it could assist in the restoration of degraded habitat and connectivity.",Market-Based Incentives and Private Ownership of Wildlife to Remedy Shortfalls in Government Funding for Conservation,Conservation Letters,10.1111/conl.12313

We derived the values of return on investment by first setting a common biological target (the total number of raptor fledglings produced per year). We then compared overall costs in achieving such target via the wide implementation of the results from the thesis (i.e., allocating resources to the most effective intervention) versus a business as usual scenario.

Little is known about how elevated reactive N input has affected the carbon (C) sequestration capability of China's terrestrial ecosystems, largely due to the lack of reliable data on N deposition. Here we have used a newly developed data set of historical N deposition at a spatial resolution of 10 km×10 km in combination with other gridded historical information on climate, atmospheric composition, land use, and land management practices to drive a process-based ecosystem model, the dynamic land ecosystem model (DLEM) for examining how increasing N deposition and its interactions with other environmental changes have affected C fluxes and storage in China's terrestrial ecosystems during 1901-2005. Our model simulations indicate that increased N deposition has resulted in a net C sink of 62 Tg C/yr (1 Tg=10 12 g) in China's terrestrial ecosystems, totaling up to 6.51 Pg C (1 Pg=10 15 g) in the past 105 years. During the study period, the N-induced C sequestration can compensate for more than 25% of fossil-fuel CO 2 emission from China. The largest C sink was found in southeast China, a region that experienced the most significant increase of N deposition in the period 1901-2005. However, the net primary productivity induced by per-unit N deposition (referred to as ecosystem N use efficiency, ENUE, in this paper) has leveled off or declined since the 1980s. This indicates that part of the deposited N may not be invested to stimulate plant growth, but instead leave the ecosystem by various pathways. Except shrubland and northwest/southwest China, signs of N saturation are apparent in the rest major biome types and regions, with ENUE peaking in the 1980s and leveling off or declining thereafter. Therefore, to minimize the excessive N pollution while keeping the N-stimulated C uptake in China's terrestrial ecosystems, optimized management practices should be taken to increase N use efficiency rather than to keep raising N input level in the near future. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Effect of nitrogen deposition on China's terrestrial carbon uptake in the context of multifactor environmental changes,Ecological Applications,10.1890/10-1685.1

Although fire size and frequency are important, they do not necessarily scale with ecosystem effects of fire, as different ecosystems have different ecological and evolutionary relationships with fire. Our study assessed trends and patterns in fire size and frequency from 1910 to 2008 (all fires > 40 ha), and the percentage of high-severity in fires from 1987 to 2008 (all fires > 400 ha) on the four national forests of northwestern California. During 1910-2008, mean and maximum fire size and total annual area burned increased, but we found no temporal trend in the percentage of high-severity fire during 1987-2008. The time series of severity data was strongly influenced by four years with region-wide lightning events that burned huge areas at primarily low-moderate severity. Regional fire rotation reached a high of 974 years in 1984 and fell to 95 years by 2008. The percentage of high-severity fire in conifer-dominated forests was generally higher in areas dominated by smaller-diameter trees than in areas with larger-diameter trees. For Douglas-fir forests, the percentage of highseverity fire did not differ significantly between areas that re-burned and areas that only burned once (10% vs. 9%) when re-burned within 30 years. Percentage of high-severity fire decreased to 5% when intervals between first and second fires were >30 years. In contrast, in both mixed-conifer and fir/high-elevation conifer forests, the percentage of high-severity fire was less when re-burned within 30 years compared to first-time burned (12% vs. 16% for mixed conifer; 11% vs. 19% for fir/high-elevation conifer). Additionally, the percentage of highseverity fire did not differ whether the re-burn interval was less than or greater than 30 years. Years with larger fires and greatest area burned were produced by region-wide lightning events, and characterized by less winter and spring precipitation than years dominated by smaller human-ignited fires. Overall percentage of high-severity fire was generally less in years characterized by these region-wide lightning events.

We collected data on Antarctic fur seals from 1987/1988 to 1994/1995 at Seal Island, Antarctica. The BHM allowed us to link together predators and prey into a model that uses all the data efficiently and accounts for major sources of uncertainty. Based on the literature, we made hypotheses about the relationships in the model, which we compared with the model outcome after fitting the BHM. For each BHM parameter, we calculated the mean of the posterior density and the 95% credible interval. Our model confirmed others' findings that increased sea ice was related to increased krill density. Higher krill density led to reduced dive intensity of maternal fur seals, as measured by dive depth and duration, and to less time spent foraging by maternal fur seals. Heavier maternal fur seals and lower maternal foraging effort resulted in heavier pups at 22 d. No relationship was found between krill density and maternal mass, or between maternal mass and foraging effort on pup growth rates between 22 and 85 days of age. Maternal mass may have reflected environmental conditions prior to the pup provisioning season, rather than summer prey densities. Maternal mass and foraging effort were not related to pup growth rates between 22 and 85 d, possibly indicating that food was not limiting, food sources other than krill were being used, or differences occurred before pups reached age 22 d. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",A Bayesian hierarchical model of Antarctic fur seal foraging and pup growth related to sea ice and prey abundance,Ecological Applications,10.1890/11-0102.1

The 1980 eruption of the Mount St. Helens volcano in Washington, USA, provided a unique opportunity to test biotic effects of a large-scale stochastic disturbance, as well as the influence of post-disturbance management. Despite severe alteration of nearly 600 km2 of habitat, coastal tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei) were found within a portion of the blast area five years after eruption. We investigated the genetic source of recolonization within the blast area and tested whether post-eruption salvage logging and subsequent tree planting influenced tailed frog movement patterns. Our results support widespread recolonization across the blast area from multiple sources, as all sites are grouped into one genetic cluster. Landscape genetic models suggest that gene flow through the unmanaged portion of the blast area is influenced only by distance between sites and the frost-free period (r2 = 0.74). In contrast, gene flow pathways within the blast area where salvage logging and replanting occurred post-eruption are strongly limited (r2 = 0.83) by the physiologically important variables of heat load and precipitation. These data suggest that the lack of understory and coarse wood (downed and standing dead tree boles) refugia in salvaged areas may leave frogs more susceptible to desiccation and mortality than those frogs moving through the naturally regenerated area. Simulated populations based on the landscape genetic models show an increase in the inbreeding coefficient in the managed area relative to the unmanaged blast area. In sum, we show surprising resilience of an amphibian species to a catastrophic disturbance, and we suggest that, at least for this species, naturally regenerating habitat may better maintain longterm genetic diversity of populations than actively managed habitat. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Genetic structure among coastal tailed frog populations at Mount St. Helens is moderated by post-disturbance management,Ecological Applications,10.1890/11-0627.1

Two related approaches may help accomplish this goal, either applied together or in isolation: (1) concentrating anthropogenic disturbance through zoning (with protected areas and intensive management); and (2) emulating natural disturbances. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of these two approaches, applied both in isolation and in combination, on the structure of the forest landscape. To do so, we use a spatially explicit landscape simulation model on a large fire-dominated landscape in eastern Canada. Specifically, we examine the effects of (1) increasing the maximum size of logged stands (cutblocks) to better emulate the full range of fire sizes in a fire-dominated landscape, (2) increasing protected areas, and (3) adding aggregated or dispersed intensive wood production areas to the landscape in addition to protected areas (triad management). We focus on maximizing the amount and minimizing the fragmentation of old-growth forest and on reducing road construction. Increasing maximum cutblock size and adding protected areas led to reduced road construction, while the latter also resulted in less fragmentation and more old growth. Although protected areas led to reduced harvest volume, the addition of an intensive production zone (triad management) counterbalanced this loss and resulted in more old growth than equivalent scenarios with protected areas but no intensive production zone. However, we found no differences between aggregated and dispersed intensive wood production. Our results imply that differences between unmanaged and managed landscapes can be reduced by concentrating logging efforts through a combination of protected areas and intensive wood production, and by creating some larger cutblocks. We conclude that the forest industry and regulators should therefore seek to increase protected areas through triad management and consider increasing maximum cutblock size. These results add to a growing body of literature indicating that intensive management on a small part of the landscape may be better than less intensive management spread out over a much larger part of the landscape, whether this is in the context of forestry, agriculture, or urban development. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Concentrating anthropogenic disturbance to balance ecological and economic values: Applications to forest management,Ecological Applications,10.1890/11-1680.1

Annex 1 countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), many of which ratified the Kyoto Protocol, are required to report emissions of CH 4 and N2O from these fires annually. In this study, we evaluated several aspects of this reporting system, including the optimality of the crops targeted by the UNFCCC globally and within Annex 1 countries, and the consistency of emissions inventories among different countries. We also evaluated the success of individual countries in capturing interannual variability and long-term trends in agricultural fire activity. In our approach, we combined global high-resolution maps of crop harvest area and production, derived from satellite maps and ground-based census data, with Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements of active fires. At a global scale, we found that adding ground nuts (e.g., peanuts), cocoa, cotton and oil palm, and removing potato, oats, rye, and pulse other from the list of 14 crops targeted by the UNFCCC increased the percentage of active fires covered by the reporting system by 9%. Optimization led to a different recommended list for Annex 1 countries, requiring the addition of sunflower, cotton, rapeseed, and alfalfa and the removal of beans, sugarcane, pulse others, and tuber-root others. Extending emissions reporting to all Annex 1 countries (from the current set of 19 countries) would increase the efficacy of the reporting system from 6% to 15%, and further including several non-Annex 1 countries (Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Mexico, and Nigeria) would capture over 55% of active fires in croplands worldwide. Analyses of interannual trends from the United States and Australia showed the importance of both intensity of fire use and crop production in controlling year-to-year variations in agricultural fire emissions. Remote sensing provides an effective means for evaluating some aspects of the current UNFCCC emissions reporting system; and, if combined with census data, field experiments and expert opinion, has the potential to improve the robustness of the next generation inventory system. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Evaluating greenhouse gas emissions inventories for agricultural burning using satellite observations of active fires,Ecological Applications,10.1890/10-2362.1

However, the relative influence of birds and bats on insect populations and their indirect effects on leaf damage have not previously been investigated in tropical forest restoration sites. Leaf damage by herbivorous insects can negatively affect the growth and survival of tropical plants and thus can influence the success of tropical forest restoration efforts. We used an exclosure experiment to examine the top-down effects of birds and bats on insects and leaf damage in a large-scale forest restoration experiment. Given the potential influence of tree planting design on bird and bat abundances, we also investigated planting design effects on bird and bat insectivory and leaf damage. The experiment included two planting treatment plots: islands, where trees were planted in patches, and plantations, where trees were planted in rows to create continuous cover. In both types of plots, insect biomass was highest on tree branches where both birds and bats were excluded from foraging and lowest on branches without exclosures where both birds and bats were present. In the island plots, birds and bats had approximately equal impacts on insect populations, while in plantations bats appeared to have a slightly stronger effect on insects than did birds. In plantations, the levels of leaf damage were higher on branches where birds and bats were excluded than on branches where both had access. In island plots, no significant differences in leaf damage were found between exclosure treatments although potential patterns were in the same direction as in the plantations. Our results suggest that both birds and bats play important roles as top predators in restoration systems by reducing herbivorous insects and their damage to planted trees.

Recent advances in dynamical global climate prediction systems allow for sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly predictions at a seasonal scale over many shelf ecosystems. Here we assess the utility of SST predictions at this ""fishery relevant"" scale to inform management, using Pacific sardine as a case study. The value of SST anomaly predictions to management was quantified under four harvest guidelines (HGs) differing in their level of integration of SST data and predictions. The HG that incorporated stock biomass forecasts informed by skillful SST predictions led to increases in stock biomass and yield, and reductions in the probability of yield and biomass falling below socioeconomic or ecologically acceptable levels. However, to mitigate the risk of collapse in the event of an erroneous forecast, it was important to combine such forecast-informed harvest controls with additional harvest restrictions at low biomass.",Improved management of small pelagic fisheries through seasonal climate prediction:,Ecological Applications,10.1002/eap.1458

While the response of taxonomic diversity to forest management has received a great deal of scrutiny, the response of functional diversity is largely unexplored. However, functional diversity may represent a more direct link between biodiversity and ecosystem function. To examine how forest management affects diversity at multiple spatial scales, we analyzed a long-term data set that captured changes in taxonomic and functional diversity of moths (Lepidoptera), longhorned beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), and breeding birds in response to contemporary silvicultural systems in oak-hickory hardwood forests. We used these data sets to address the following questions: how do even- and uneven-aged silvicultural systems affect taxonomic and functional diversity at the scale of managed landscapes compared to the individual harvested and unharvested forest patches that comprise the landscapes, and how do these silvicultural systems affect the functional similarity of assemblages at the scale of managed landscapes and patches? Due to increased heterogeneity within landscapes, we expected even-aged silviculture to increase and uneven-aged silviculture to decrease functional diversity at the landscape level regardless of impacts at the patch level. Functional diversity responses were taxon-specific with respect to the direction of change and time since harvest. Responses were also consistent across patch and landscape levels within each taxon. Moth assemblage species richness, functional richness, and functional divergence were negatively affected by harvesting, with stronger effects resulting from uneven-aged than even-aged management. Longhorned beetle assemblages exhibited a peak in species richness two years after harvesting, while functional diversity metrics did not differ between harvested and unharvested patches and managed landscapes. The species and functional richness of breeding bird assemblages increased in response to harvesting with more persistent effects in uneven- than in even-aged managed landscapes.

To prioritize conservation of vulnerable species, it is therefore critical to effectively predict species' responses to invasive plants, which may be facilitated by a framework based on species' traits. We studied the population and community responses of small mammals and changes in habitat heterogeneity across a gradient of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) cover, a widespread invasive plant in North America. We live-trapped small mammals over two summers and assessed the effect of cheatgrass on native small mammal abundance, richness, and species-specific and trait-based occupancy, while accounting for detection probability and other key habitat elements. Abundance was only estimated for the most common species, deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). All species were pooled for the trait-based occupancy analysis to quantify the ability of small mammal traits (habitat association, mode of locomotion, and diet) to predict responses to cheatgrass invasion. Habitat heterogeneity decreased with cheatgrass cover. Deer mouse abundance increased marginally with cheatgrass. Species richness did not vary with cheatgrass, however, pocket mouse (Perognathus spp.) and harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys spp.) occupancy tended to decrease and increase, respectively, with cheatgrass cover, suggesting a shift in community composition. Cheatgrass had little effect on occupancy for deer mice, 13-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), and Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii). Species' responses to cheatgrass primarily corresponded with our a priori predictions based on species' traits. The probability of occupancy varied significantly with a species' habitat association but not with diet or mode of locomotion. When considered within the context of a rapid habitat change, such as caused by invasive plants, relevant species' traits may provide a useful framework for predicting species' responses to a variety of habitat disturbances. Understanding which species are likely to be most affected by exotic plant invasion will help facilitate more efficient, targeted management and conservation of native species and habitats.",Species' traits help predict small mammal responses to habitat homogenization by an invasive grass:,Ecological Applications,10.1002/eap.1535

Community- and ecosystem-level implications of altered species distributions may be complex and challenging to anticipate due to the cascading effects of disrupted interactions among species, which may exhibit threshold responses to extreme climatic events. Toxic, bloom-forming cyanobacteria like Microcystis are expected to increase worldwide with climate change, due in part to their high temperature optima for growth. In addition, invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have caused an increase in Microcystis aeruginosa, a species typically associated with eutrophication, in low-nutrient lakes. We conducted a 13-yr study of a M. aeruginosa population in a low-nutrient lake invaded by zebra mussels. In 10 of the 13 years, there was a significant positive relationship between M. aeruginosa biomass and accumulated degree days, which are projected to increase with climate change. In contrast, Microcystis biomass was up to an order of magnitude lower than predicted by the above relationship during the other three years, including the warmest in the data set, following repeated heat-induced mass mortality of D. polymorpha. Thus, the positive relationship between Microcystis biomass and temperature was negated when its facilitating species was suppressed during a series of exceptionally warm summers. Predicting the net response of a species to climate change may therefore require, at minimum, quantification of responses of both the focal species and species that strongly interact with it over sufficiently long time periods to encompass the full range of climatic variability.

We use a structured model of a temperate rocky reef to explore how multi-trophic level fisheries impact ecological resilience. Increasing fishing mortality of prey (urchins) has a minor effect on equilibrium biomass of kelp, urchins, and spiny lobster predators, but increases resilience by reducing the range of predator harvest rates at which alternative stable states are possible. Size-structured predation on urchins acts as the feedback maintaining each state. Our results demonstrate that the resilience of ecosystems strongly depends on the interactive effects of predator and prey harvest in multi-trophic level fisheries, which are common in marine ecosystems but are unaccounted for by traditional management.",Interactive effects of predator and prey harvest on ecological resilience of rocky reefs,Ecological Applications,10.1002/eap.1581

A sigmoidal response of wood NPP to external N inputs was observed in the both higher and lower productivity stands, reaching a maximum of ~65% enhancement regardless of the native site productivity, saturating at an external N input of 4-5 g N·m-2·yr-1. The rate of increase in wood NPP and the N response efficiency (REN, increase in wood NPP per external N input) were maximized at an external N input of ~3 g N·m-2·yr-1, regardless of site productivity. The maximum REN was greater in the higher productivity than the lower productivity stand (~20 vs. ~14 g C/g N). The N-induced enhancement of wood NPP and its REN were, however, markedly contingent on climatic variables. In both of the higher and lower productivity stands, wood NPP increased with growing season precipitation (P), but only up to ~400 mm. The sensitivity of the response to P increased with increasing external N inputs. Increasing growing season temperature (T) somewhat increased the N-induced drought effect, whereas decreasing T reduced the drought effect. These responses of wood NPP infused a large temporal variation to REN, making the use of a fixed value unadvisable. Based on these results, we suggest that regional climate conditions and future climate scenarios should be considered when modeling carbon sequestration in response to N deposition in boreal P. sylvestris, and possibly other forests.",Annual climate variation modifies nitrogen induced carbon accumulation of Pinus sylvestris forests,Ecological Applications,10.1002/eap.1571

Life table response experiments (LTRE) aim to decompose the effects of change in parameters on past demographic outcomes (e.g., population growth rates). But the vast majority of LTREs and other retrospective population analyses have focused on decomposing asymptotic population growth rates, which do not account for the dynamic interplay between population structure and vital rates that shape realized population growth rates (<U+03BB>t=Nt+1/Nt) in time-varying environments. We provide an empirical means to overcome these shortcomings by merging recently developed ""transient life-table response experiments"" with integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs allow for the estimation of latent population structure and other demographic parameters that are required for transient LTRE analysis, and Bayesian versions additionally allow for complete error propagation from the estimation of demographic parameters to derivations of realized population growth rates and perturbation analyses of growth rates. By integrating available monitoring data for Lesser Scaup over 60 yr, and conducting transient LTREs on IPM estimates, we found that the contribution of juvenile female survival to long-term variation in realized population growth rates was 1.6 and 3.7 times larger than that of adult female survival and fecundity, respectively. But a persistent long-term decline in fecundity explained 92% of the decline in abundance between 1983 and 2006. In contrast, an improvement in adult female survival drove the modest recovery in Lesser Scaup abundance since 2006, indicating that the most important demographic drivers of Lesser Scaup population dynamics are temporally dynamic. In addition to resolving uncertainty about Lesser Scaup population dynamics, the merger of IPMs with transient LTREs will strengthen our understanding of demography for many species as we aim to conserve biodiversity during an era of non-stationary global change.",Understanding the demographic drivers of realized population growth rates:,Ecological Applications,10.1002/eap.1594

We combined greenhouse, field, and laboratory experiments involving the invasive forb spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) and native bunchgrasses to assess direct and indirect effects of the forb-specific herbicide picloram on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which are beneficial soil fungi that colonize most plants. Picloram had no effect on bunchgrass viability and their associated AMF in the greenhouse, but killed spotted knapweed and reduced AMF colonization of a subsequent host grown. Results were similar in the field where AMF abundance in bunchgrass-dominated plots was unaffected by herbicides one year after spraying based on 16:1<U+03C9>5 phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) concentrations. In spotted-knapweed-dominated plots, however, picloram application shifted dominance from spotted knapweed, a good AMF host, to bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa), a poor AMF host. This coincided with a 63% reduction in soil 16:1<U+03C9>5 NLFA concentrations but no reduction of 16:1<U+03C9>5 PLFA. Because 16:1<U+03C9>5 NLFA quantifies AMF storage lipids and 16:1<U+03C9>5 PLFA occurs in AMF membrane lipids, we speculate that the herbicide-mediated reduction in host quality reduced fungal carbon storage, but not necessarily fungal abundance after one year in the field. Overall, in greenhouse and field experiments, AMF were only affected when picloram altered host quantity and quality. This apparent lack of direct effect was supported by our in-vitro trial where picloram applied to AMF mycelia did not reduce fungal biomass and viability. We show that the herbicide picloram can have profound, indirect effects on AMF within one year. Depending on herbicide-mediated shifts in host quality, rapid interventions may be necessary post herbicide applications to prevent loss of AMF abundance. Future research should assess consequences of these potential shifts for the restoration of native plants that differ in mycorrhizal dependency.",Strong indirect herbicide effects on mycorrhizal associations through plant community shifts and secondary invasions,Ecological Applications,10.1002/eap.1613

Global warming and other environmental changes have favored the success of invasive species, deeply modifying the structure of aquatic communities in large rivers. Some exogenous species could alter trophic interactions within assemblages by increasing the predation risk for potential prey species (top-down effect) and limiting the dynamics of others via resource availability limitation (bottom-up effect). Furthermore, large transboundary rivers are complex aquatic ecosystems that have often been poorly investigated so that data for assessing long-term ecological trends are missing. In this study, we propose an original approach for investigating long-term combined effects of global warming, trophic resource decrease, predation risk, and water quality variations on the trait-based structure of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages over 26 yr (1985-2011) and 427-km stretch of the river Meuse (France and Belgium). The study of temporal variations in biological, physiological, and ecological traits of macroinvertebrate and fish allowed identifying community trends and distinguishing impacts of environmental perturbations from those induced by biological alterations. We provide evidence, for this large European river, of an increase in water temperature (close to 1°C) and a decrease in phytoplankton biomass (-85%), as well as independent effects of these changes on both invertebrate and fish communities. The reduction of trophic resources in the water column by invasive molluscs has dramatically affected the density of omnivorous fish in favor of invertebrate feeders, while scrapers became the major feeding guild among invertebrates. Macroinvertebrate and fish communities have shifted from large-sized organisms with low fecundity to prolific, small-sized organisms, with early maturity, as a response to increased predation pressure.",Long-term trends in trait structure of riverine communities facing predation risk increase and trophic resource decline,Ecological Applications,10.1002/eap.1621

Since the impacts of tourism are variable, it is important to understand which businesses are providing conservation and community benefits. Commercial success is often cited as an important determinant of sustainable behaviour, however, little research examines relationships between commercial success and provision of conservation and community benefits. Tour operators (businesses that organize and run tours) and agencies (businesses that sell tours operated by others) offering nature-based tours and travel services in Costa Rica were surveyed to answer the following questions: is commercial success in tourism ventures associated with conservation behaviour and the provision of benefits to local communities? If so, what factors are most associated with commercial success? Commercially successful entrepreneurs provided environmental education to visitors, supported conservation groups or initiatives, reduced, reused and/or recycled waste, used environmentally friendly equipment, and built formal partnerships with community members. Typically, these entrepreneurs had larger businesses, greater perceived success (relative to other similar businesses), and more growth (both in terms of visitors and employees). However, the extent to which entrepreneurs educated and employed local people, purchased supplies locally, and patronized local hotels and lodges was not related to commercial success. Overall, a relationship existed between an entrepreneur's level of commercial success and the provision of conservation benefits, but there was little evidence supporting a relationship between commercial success and community benefits. Nevertheless, most tourism businesses reported that they do provide benefits to local communities regardless of their level of commercial success. Therefore, in a country like Costa Rica, with a long history of using tourism as a conservation and community development tool, this study showed that tourism can benefit the environment and local people. © 2011 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.",Linking commercial success of tour operators and agencies to conservation and community benefits in Costa Rica,Environmental Conservation,10.1017/S0376892911000415

To promote sustainable use, the interactions between anthropogenic and environmental factors affecting vegetation structure in savannahs need to be understood. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data collected over 4758 ha were used to examine woody vegetation structure in five communal rangelands around 12 settlements in Bushbuckridge, a municipality in the Kruger to Canyons Biosphere Reserve (South Africa). The importance of underlying abiotic factors was evaluated by measuring size class distributions across catenas and using canonical correspondence analysis. Landscape position was significant in determining structure, indicating the importance of underlying biophysical factors. Differences in structure were settlement-specific, related to mean annual precipitation at one site, and human population density and intensity of use at the other four sites. Size class distributions of woody vegetation revealed human disturbance gradients around settlements. Intensity of use affected the amplitude, not the shape, of the size class distribution, suggesting the same height classes were being harvested across settlements, but amount harvested varied between settlements. Highly used rangelands result in a disappearance of disturbance gradients, leading to homogeneous patches of low woody cover around settlements with limited rehabilitation options. Reductions in disturbance gradients can serve as early warning indicators of woodland degradation, a useful tool in planning for conservation and sustainable development. © 2011 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.",Human-modified landscapes: Patterns of fine-scale woody vegetation structure in communal savannah rangelands,Environmental Conservation,10.1017/S0376892911000592

For these reasons it is important to understand professional and public opinions as to which aspects of such crimes make them more or less serious, and so deserving of a greater or lesser sentence. Conjoint analysis, a method used in marketing to understand which characteristics of a product are valued by consumers, was used to investigate which attributes of hypothetical wildlife trade offences (threat status and taxon of species involved, illegal profit, previous convictions and plea) UK-based conservation professionals, magistrates and the general public considered most important when sentencing wildlife criminals in the UK. Eighty-seven per cent of 682 respondents completed enough of the survey to be included in the analysis. Magistrates and the public considered illegal profit to be the single most important attribute, while conservationists considered the threat status of the species involved to be most important (considered second most important by magistrates and the public). Magistrates, when presented with adequate information, considered the threat status and corresponding legal protection afforded to wildlife when considering how serious a wildlife trade crime was, and doing so is in line with public opinion on sentencing such offences.

This review examines why deep-sea fisheries have generally failed, and recommends measures that are necessary to improve their sustainability. Much is based on lessons learned in the south-west Pacific that may be more generally applicable to global deep-sea fisheries. Sustainable fisheries require highly precautionary feature-based catch limits, and credible and timely stock assessment advice. Management also needs to consider fishing impacts on the benthic habitat, and while reducing and spreading fishing effort on seamounts is beneficial for fish stocks, it can have a negative effect on the benthos. To balance exploitation and conservation, elements of spatial management are required, whereby some seamounts are protected before any fishing has occurred. Protected areas should include entire seamounts, and multiple seamounts in a network. A management regime should incorporate closed seamounts, open seamounts for fishing, and management of adjacent slope areas where these are important for the productivity of fish and invertebrate populations. © Copyright Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2012.",Spatial management of deep-sea seamount fisheries: Balancing sustainable exploitation and habitat conservation,Environmental Conservation,10.1017/S0376892912000021

Potential underlying causes of divergent perceptions towards different management tools were evaluated, including marine protected areas, no-take fisheries closures, gear use, minimum size of fish caught and species restrictions. The analysis identified three distinct opinion groups: (1) a group of nine landing sites that scaled their preference for most management restrictions neutral to low, with exceptions for minimum sizes of captured fish and gear restrictions; (2) a group of eight landing sites that scaled their preference for the above and species restrictions and closed season higher, and were more neutral about closures and marine protected areas; and (3) a group containing four landing sites and the managers' offices that rated their preference for the above and closed areas and marine protected areas as high. Logistic regression was used to examine whether these groups differed in wealth, education, age, perceptions of disparity in benefits, dependence on fishing and distance to government marine protected areas. The most frequent significant factor was the resource users' perceived disparity between the benefits of the management to themselves and their communities, with the benefits to the government. Consequently, efforts to reduce this real or perceived disparity are likely to increase adoption and compliance rates.

Timber production, carbon stocking and habitat quality ecosystem services were calculated with simulation outputs. Habitat quality was measured using a habitat suitability index that integrated stand structural indicators. A multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was performed in order to rank scenarios. We show that the most intensive management yielded greater timber volumes but resulted in the weakest carbon and habitat quality scores. The TRIAD scenarios in sugar maple-beech stands offered the best compromise in services compared to single management. In shade-intolerant deciduous stands, there was a loss of timber production with TRIAD scenarios, but greater carbon stock and habitat quality were observed. Our study contrasts alternative management scenarios for ecosystem services in woodlots of different forest types. It confirms that multiple harvest systems better achieve multiple services.

Waiving property taxes on forestland provides incentives for landowners to afforest non-forested land and/or sustain forests that are at risk of deforestation. We focus on 17 Tennessee counties and one Kentucky county, constituting one of 179 Bureau of Economic Analysis areas in the United States, as a case study. Higher forestland net return from waiving property taxes increases the share of forestland in the 18 counties, which in turn increases the accumulation of carbon in the forest ecosystem, suggesting that this is a viable approach. The annualized county-level cost of supplying forest carbon sequestration using a tax-based subsidy ranges between US$15.56 and US$563.58 per carbon tonne across the 18 counties. Relevant government agencies can use these estimates to target selected counties for more cost-effective adoption of the county-level tax-based subsidy approach.",Evaluating a tax-based subsidy approach for forest carbon sequestration,Environmental Conservation,10.1017/S0376892917000078

However, decision-making under customary governance systems may be vulnerable to mismanagement. Government-led ILSM processes have the potential to design management actions that address the spatial scale of ecosystem processes and threats within the context of national policy and legislation, but may not fully capture broad stakeholder interests, and implementation may be poorly coordinated across highly dispersed island archipelagos.

Surveys were performed by recording the number and size of edible fish species and benthic composition. Fishing impact was described through six proxies representing level of catch, alternative incomes, degree of commercial catch and country economic development derived from a simultaneous socioeconomic assessment. The relative importance of broadly defined habitat (geographical location, island and reef type, substrate composition) and fishing impact in controlling the distribution of fish trophic groups, families and species was measured through multivariate analysis. The extreme faunistic diversity was shown by the large variation in fish density (difference of up to an order of magnitude) and fish biomass (displaying a 20-fold difference across the region). Herbivores were dominant in the eastern part of the region, at what we classified as complex islands and at islands with small lagoon and at coastal reefs, while carnivores were dominant at oceanic islands and atolls and at outer reefs. Specific habitat associations were shown for Scaridae, Acanthuridae, Siganidae, Balistidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae and Serranidae. Relative importance and size decrease of several fish families (Mullidae, Scaridae, Lutjanidae and Serranidae) were related to high fishing impact. Acanthuridae and Lethrinidae appeared to have a role as opportunistic groups in impacted sites.

We present a case-study from over 100years of data for the endemic landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, Salmonidae) and brown trout (Salmo trutta, Salmonidae) in Lake Vänern, Sweden. We use this case-study to develop life history-based research and monitoring priorities for migratory salmonids. In Vänern, small wild populations of salmon and trout remain only in the heavily regulated Rivers Klar (Klarälven) and Gullspång (Gullspångsälven), and commercial and sport fisheries are maintained by hatchery stocking. These populations represent some of the last remaining large-bodied (up to 20kg) landlocked salmon stocks worldwide. We found that one of four stocks of wild fish has increased since 1996; the other three remain critically low. Hatchery return rates for three of four stocks appear stable at roughly 1% and annual fisheries catch is roughly 75metric tons, with an estimated 7.5% of hatchery smolts being recruited to the fishery; this also appears relatively stable since 1990. Our analysis reveals much uncertainty in key data requirements, including both river return and fisheries catch rates, estimates of wild smolt production and survival, and hatchery breeding and genetics protocols. These uncertainties, coupled with a lack of information on their riverine and lacustrine ecology, preclude effective management of these unique populations.

Many fisheries management organizations have addressed the problem of overharvesting and over-capitalization first. In this domain, the question of access regulation has gained growing recognition as a key dimension of fisheries sustainability, leading to recommendation and progressive implementation of rights-based systems, in particular Individual Transferrable Quotas (ITQs). While adjustments in fishing capacity resulting from the implementation of these systems may entail a reduction in some unwanted ecosystem impacts of fishing, it is also recognized that they will not be sufficient to achieve the ecological outcomes increasingly demanded by the global community. There is thus a need to examine the possibilities for a common management framework for dealing with both over-capitalization of fisheries and adverse ecological effects of fishing. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of incorporating greater ecosystem goods and services into ITQ policy instruments initially designed with a narrow focus on commercial target species. We consider the advantages and limitations of alternative approaches in this respect and identify some of the practical issues associated with the different alternatives, in particular the underpinning knowledge requirements. We argue that given the need for increasingly streamlined management processes, further investigation into practical ways forward in this domain is crucial if management of fisheries is to achieve economic efficiency while fully encompassing the ecologically sustainable development objectives of ecosystem-based fisheries management. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Commonwealth of Australia.",Beyond Individual Transferrable Quotas: Methodologies for integrating ecosystem impacts of fishing into fisheries catch rights,Fish and Fisheries,10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00442.x

Recognizing this, there is an urgent need to go beyond the mere documentation of the phenomenon and learn more about the origins of this problem and the nature of factors influencing its occurrence to develop solutions. In an attempt to understand seafood mislabelling more thoroughly in Europe, 226 cod products were purchased from Ireland and the UK, genetically identified using a DNA barcoding technique (COI barcoding gene), and species identification results were compared against product labels. Cod mislabelling proved more severe in Ireland than in the UK (28.4% vs. 7.4%). Moreover, whereas data show that in Ireland, cheaper species are sold as cod, in the UK, threatened Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) may be sold as 'sustainably sourced' Pacific cod. Considering these countries operate under the same EU policies for seafood traceability and labelling, it is likely that this situation has been influenced by heightened consumer awareness in the UK, which has created an environment where mislabelling is discouraged. In addition to identifying samples, traceability information from packaged cod was used to trace products back to supplying companies. Although inconclusive in determining blame, this exercise has demonstrated that using traceability information can add explanatory power when attempting to determine responsibility for the occurrence of mislabelling. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Seafood mislabelling: Comparisons of two western European case studies assist in defining influencing factors, mechanisms and motives",Fish and Fisheries,10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00426.x

Although the northern terrestrial boundary of this DPS remains uncertain, our consensus opinion was that this northern boundary occurs south of the Nass River and that the DPS was discrete from more northern eulachon, as well as significant to the biological species as a whole and thus is a 'species' under the ESA. Eulachon have been nearly absent in northern California for over two decades, have declined in the Fraser River by over 97% in the past 10years, and are at historically low levels in other British Columbia rivers in the DPS, and nearly so in the Columbia River. Major threats to southern eulachon include climate change impacts on ocean and freshwater habitat, by-catch in offshore shrimp trawl fisheries, changes in downstream flow timing and intensity owing to dams and water diversions, and predation. These threats, together with large declines in abundance, indicate that the southern DPS of eulachon is at moderate risk of extinction throughout all of its range.

We develop a state-dependent decision-making model to address the spatial allocation of effort in an Australian tuna longline fishery. We assume that fishers have an economic objective in deciding where to fish, but that decisions in any period are also influenced by the remaining quota held at the time of the decision. Key features of the model include endogenous price dynamics, a moving stock and a competitive pool of different vessel types operating from different port locations. We utilize this model to illustrate fleet responses to marine reserves and limits on fishing effort. The results illustrate that the model framework provides advantages over statistically based models in that decisions made in response to the imposition of a reserve are not consistent with a proportional reallocation of effort. Rather, the stochastic dynamic model yielded an overall profit level of ~4% higher relative to scenarios with no reserve. Incorporating the opportunity cost of a quota into the model resulted in an optimal utilization of effort, in which effort was concentrated in time periods and locations yielding maximized profit. Under a low level of effort relative to the season length, the model indicated an overall profit level 43% greater than the highest obtained when the same level of effort was applied solely within any given quarter of the season. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Assessing opportunity and relocation costs of marine protected areas using a behavioural model of longline fleet dynamics,Fish and Fisheries,10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00422.x

Many marine organisms, like molluscs and corals, build hard shells and skeletons using carbonate ions, and they exhibit negative overall responses to ocean acidification. This adds to other chronic and acute environmental pressures and promotes shifts away from calcifier-rich communities. In this study, we examine the possible implications of ocean acidification on mollusc harvests worldwide by examining present production, consumption and export and by relating those data to present and future surface ocean chemistry forecast by a coupled climate-ocean model (Community Climate System 3.1; CCSM3). We identify the 'transition decade' when future ocean chemistry will distinctly differ from that of today (2010), and when mollusc harvest levels similar to those of the present cannot be guaranteed if present ocean chemistry is a significant determinant of today's mollusc production. We assess nations' vulnerability to ocean acidification-driven decreases in mollusc harvests by comparing nutritional and economic dependences on mollusc harvests, overall societal adaptability, and the amount of time until the transition decade. Projected transition decades for individual countries will occur 10-50years after 2010. Countries with low adaptability, high nutritional or economic dependence on molluscs, rapidly approaching transition decades or rapidly growing populations will therefore be most vulnerable to ocean acidification-driven mollusc harvest decreases. These transition decades suggest how soon nations should implement strategies, such as increased aquaculture of resilient species, to help maintain current per capita mollusc harvests. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Nutrition and income from molluscs today imply vulnerability to ocean acidification tomorrow,Fish and Fisheries,10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00424.x

Pieces of the model have been suggested in the literature, and these pieces are formalized here realizing the current operating parameters of the global seafood industry. The derived pull-threshold model assumes that if producers exceed the threshold, there is no incentive to improve while if too far below, improvement is most likely beyond technical or financial means. Thus, a single certification is only a marginal solution to the larger picture. Those producers immediately below the certification threshold are within range or 'pull' of the threshold to improve as a result of certification. Results from a single threshold model applied to compliance data indicated that a maximum improvement of 12.5%, achieved when the pull was the greatest and the threshold was at the lower end of the impact distribution. When impacts were continuous (e.g. escapes in aquaculture), greater improvement was observed with thresholds targeting the producers at the higher end of the impact distribution. In all cases, improvement was maximized with a triple threshold model, indicating that single threshold scenario will not drive the greatest movement towards environmental improvement throughout the industry. Innovation is potentially more important in reducing environmental impacts of seafood production and needs to be accounted for as the seafood certification or ecolabelling continues to mature. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Environmental improvement of seafood through certification and ecolabelling: Theory and analysis,Fish and Fisheries,10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00404.x

Cumulatively, we estimate that reduction fisheries emitted 4.6 million tonnes of CO2-e GHGs in 2014, and appropriated over 4% of primary production in some ecosystems, demonstrating a non-trivial impact. As demand for aquafeeds grow, the sustainable sourcing of raw material inputs will be of great importance.

However, the ways by which to operationalize ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) remain poorly specified. We propose a specific methodological frameworkviability modellingto do so. We show how viability modelling can be applied using four contrasted case-studies: two small-scale fisheries in South America and Pacific and two larger-scale fisheries in Europe and Australia. The four fisheries are analysed using the same modelling framework, structured around a set of common methods, indicators and scenarios. The calibrated models are dynamic, multispecies and multifleet and account for various sources of uncertainty. A multicriteria evaluation is used to assess the scenarios outcomes over a long time horizon with different constraints based on ecological, social and economic reference points. Results show to what extent the bio-economic and ecosystem risks associated with the adoption of status quo strategies are relatively high and challenge the implementation of EBFM. In contrast, strategies called ecoviability or co-viability strategies, that aim at satisfying the viability constraints, reduce significantly these ecological and economic risks and promote EBFM.

Criteria included fisher involvement, biodiversity conservation and fisheries management objectives.

Towed bottom-fishing gears typically kill 2050 per cent of the benthic invertebrates in their path, depending on gear type, substrate and vulnerability of particular taxa. Particularly vulnerable are epifaunal species, which stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for benthic invertebrates. To identify the habitats, fisheries or target species most likely to be affected, we review evidence of the indirect effects of bottom fishing on fish production. Recent studies have found differences in the diets of certain species in relation to bottom fishing intensity, thereby linking demersal fish to their benthic habitats at spatial scales of ~10 km. Bottom fishing affects diet composition and prey quality rather than the amount of prey consumed; scavenging of discarded by-catch makes only a small contribution to yearly food intake. Flatfish may benefit from light trawling levels on sandy seabeds, while higher-intensity trawling on more vulnerable habitats has a negative effect. Models suggest that reduction in the carrying capacity of habitats by bottom fishing could lead to lower equilibrium yield and a lower level of fishing mortality to obtain maximum yield. Trawling effort is patchily distributed  small fractions of fishing grounds are heavily fished, while large fractions are lightly fished or unfished. This patchiness, coupled with the foraging behaviour of demersal fish, may mitigate the indirect effects of bottom fishing on fish productivity. Current research attempts to scale up these localized effects to the population level.",Indirect effects of bottom fishing on the productivity of marine fish,Fish and Fisheries,10.1111/faf.12193

We defined success as increased or maintained abundance or biomass, reductions in fishing mortality or improvements in population status. Because the literature only covered a narrow set of biological factors, we also conducted an expert elicitation to create a typology of broader fishery characteristics, enabling conditions and design considerations that affect performance. The literature suggested that the most commonly used management tool in a region was often the most successful, although the scale of success varied. Management tools were more often deemed successful when used in combination, particularly pairings of tools that controlled fishing mortality or effort with spatial management. Examples of successful combinations were the use of catch limits with quotas and limited entry, and marine protected areas with effort restrictions.

These trade-offs are compounded by interacting species and fisheries at the ecosystem level. Weighing objectives becomes increasingly challenging when managers have to consider opposing objectives from different stakeholders. An alternative to weighing incomparable and conflicting objectives is to focus on winwins until Pareto efficiency is achieved: a state from which it is impossible to improve with respect to any objective without regressing at least one other. We investigate the ecosystem-level efficiency of fisheries in five large marine ecosystems (LMEs) with respect to yield and an aggregate measure of ecosystem impact using a novel calibration of size-based ecosystem models. We estimate that fishing patterns in three LMEs (North Sea, Barents Sea and Benguela Current) are nearly efficient with respect to long-term yield and ecosystem impact and that efficiency has improved over the last 30 years. In two LMEs (Baltic Sea and North East US Continental Shelf), fishing is inefficient and winwins remain available. We additionally examine the efficiency of North Sea and Baltic Sea fisheries with respect to economic rent and ecosystem impact, finding both to be inefficient but steadily improving. Our results suggest the following: (i) a broad and encouraging trend towards ecosystem-level efficiency of fisheries; (ii) that ecosystem-scale winwins, especially with respect to conservation and profits, may still be common; and (iii) single-species assessment approaches may overestimate the availability of winwins by failing to account for trade-offs across interacting species.",Efficiency of fisheries is increasing at the ecosystem level,Fish and Fisheries,10.1111/faf.12171

The five most expensive (retail price per kg) marine species sold on the global fisheries market are polychaetes (Glycera dibranchiata, Diopatra aciculata, Nereis (Alitta) virens, Arenicola defodiens and Marphysa sanguinea). We estimate that 1600 t of N. virens per annum (worth £52 million) are landed in the UK with approximately 121 000 tonnes of polychaetes collected globally valued at £5.9 billion. Using remote closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras to monitor collectors, activity at local sites is considerable with a mean of 3.14 collectors per tide (day and night) at one site and individuals digging for up to 3 h per tide, although intensity differed seasonally and between sites. Collectors removed on average 1.4 kg of N. virens per person per hour, walking a considerable distance across the intertidal sediment to reach areas that were usually already dug. The implications of these human activity and biomass removal levels are explored in the context of fisheries and conservation management. At local, regional and national scales, polychaete bait fisheries are highly valuable, extract significant biomass and have considerable impacts; therefore, they urgently require governance equivalent to other fisheries.",Bait worms: a valuable and important fishery with implications for fisheries and conservation management,Fish and Fisheries,10.1111/faf.12178

In 2002 an extreme landscape scale fire burnt extensive areas of forests in eastern Australia, including rainforests that are rarely severely burnt. This unique event allowed us to test long-held assumptions that predict landscape scale change after major disturbance. We tested three assumptions for detecting alternative community states; (1) that the scale of the event was large enough to remove canopy dominants, (2) fire feedbacks, both positive and negative are present, and (3) shifts in the floristic composition of communities are detected. We also examined whether high severity fires resulted in a community shift from less flammable to more flammable vegetation (e.g. from rainforest to wet sclerophyll vegetation), by examining floristic composition of vegetation communities (rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest, and dry sclerophyll forest) when burnt at different fire severities (high and low). Conversely, we tested whether there was a state shift from flammable to less flammable vegetation communities in sclerophyll forests long unburnt. In addition, we determined if there was any evidence that antecedent fire regimes and fire severity influenced flammability feedbacks.Severe fire caused significant ongoing disruption to forest canopies and fire effects were still detectable some 7. years after fire. Whilst some pyrogenic environmental feedbacks were detected from historic fire regimes, we found no shifts in the floristic composition or pyrogenic traits of forests burned at high severity. Medium-term (30. year) fire exclusion did not result in the sclerophyll forest becoming more pyrophobic although some fire-cued species senesced in the absence of fire.Contrary to expectation, we found no evidence that the floristic composition of less flammable vegetation burnt at high severity became more similar to flammable vegetation burnt at low severity or that were unburnt. Conversely, with more than 30. years of fire exclusion there was no evidence that the sclerophyllous communities became more floristically similar to rainforest. We have shown that species assemblages in warm-temperate rainforest were resilient to a catastrophic fire event and propose that these forests are unlikely to represent alternative community states driven by fire alone. © 2011.","Fire severity, feedback effects and resilience to alternative community states in forest assemblages",Forest Ecology and Management,10.1016/j.foreco.2011.10.025

It is, for instance, crucial information to be able to assess sustainable harvesting potentials. Furthermore, since the development of growing stock and increment, and thus the patterns of net carbon exchange, are strongly affected by the age of the forest, information about the age structure is needed to understand the temporal variability of the greenhouse gas budgets and potential contributions of forest management (i.e. their additionality) to long-term removal of carbon from the atmosphere. European forests have changed drastically in recent decades, but to date no European level compilation of historical forest age structure data is available. In this study, country level historical age-class data was combined with a backcasting method to reconstruct the age-class structure for 25 European countries from 1950 to 2010 (total forest area in 2010: 118.3. million ha). Based on the results, dynamic maps of forest age-class distributions on 0.25° × 0.25° grid were generated, and the change in the forest age structure was analysed. Results show that the share of old forests (>100. years) has decreased from 26% in 1950 to 17% in 2010, and the mean age over the studied area decreased from 67 to 60. years. However, when looking at the change of the mean age from 1950 to 2010 at country level, there is a large variation between the countries. We discuss implications of the results and argue that the development of forest age structure contributed less than previously thought to the carbon sink in European forests from 1950 onwards. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Reconstructed forest age structure in Europe 1950-2010,Forest Ecology and Management,10.1016/j.foreco.2012.08.048

Therefore, we investigated breeding season habitat use of radio-tagged wild turkeys (n= 78) in a frequently burned pine savanna system in southwest Georgia during 2003-2005. Ground story vegetation structure and composition in pine savannas change rapidly following fire such that categorical (i.e., burned vs. unburned) habitat selection analyses does not depict the fine scaled time-dependent relationships; therefore, we analyzed turkey selection of savanna on a seasonal and continuous scale. From a seasonal standpoint, pine savanna habitat-type were selected by gobblers, but used less than availability by hens. However, selection of pine savanna was influenced by time since fire; hens more likely selected pine savannas burned within 1.4. years whereas gobblers selected pine savannas burned within 1.6. years. Hens also selected hardwood drains whereas gobblers demonstrated proportional use of these habitats. Selection of pine savannas by wild turkeys was dependent on application of prescribed burning <2. years and suggests that previous recommendations for longer burning frequencies are too long to balance turkey habitat needs with those of a suite of declining birds associated with pine savanna ecosystems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Wild Turkey habitat use in frequently-burned pine savanna,Forest Ecology and Management,10.1016/j.foreco.2012.07.051

We quantified climate-growth relationships between basal area increment indexes and regional mean temperature and precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration (P-PET); drought sensitivity was defined as the percentage of growth reduction during an extreme drought event. Local climatic data spanning the 20th century yielded a warming trend and increasing extreme drought events since the onset of the 1980s. The P. nigra populations located at the lower altitudinal border showed the most significant correlation (negative) between mean temperature and declining growth trends. Contrasting to P. nigra, the studied P. pinaster population, also located at lower elevations, showed the higher correlations (positive) between P-PET and the higher mean growth. Aside from growth-climate relationships our results suggest a major effect of soil conditions and stand structure on tree growth and climate-growth responses. Old P. nigra stands showed the lower mean growth, while thinned stands, about 130. years old, located at the core of the elevation range showed positive growth trends resembling a positive relationship with winter-to-spring temperatures and the higher soil organic matter content.

Soil grading and herbaceous vegetation seeding are essential reclamation practices that may influence plant community reestablishment and hydrologic processes that are essential to forested landscapes. We evaluated effects of grading and seeding practices on tree survival and growth, recruitment of plant species, and water infiltration on three steep-slope mine sites in the USA's central Appalachian coalfield. Half of each site was graded to a smooth condition while the other half was graded less intensively leaving a rough, loose soil surface. Three seeding practices were applied on each grading treatment: a conventional seed mix of grasses and legumes; grasses and legumes selected to be less competitive with planted trees ("" tree compatible"" ); and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) alone. Native trees of 13 species were hand-planted on all areas. Over one growing season with adequate rainfall, the survival and average height growth for trees were similar on smooth (69%, 121. mm) and loose (70%, 119. mm) grading treatments, as well as on the conventional (65%, 116. mm), tree-compatible (69%, 129. mm), and annual ryegrass (75%, 126. mm) seeding treatments. After two years, herbaceous ground cover did not differ among grading treatments but was greater on conventional seeding (83%) than on annual ryegrass seeded areas (55%), while non-planted herbaceous richness (11) and herbaceous native species richness (4.5) were greatest on the annual ryegrass treatment. Water infiltration was slowest on areas with the annual ryegrass seeding treatment and positively correlated with living herbaceous ground cover. Annual ryegrass seeding appears promising as a potential reclamation practice when restoring native forest vegetation where site properties are favorable to native species invasion and where water runoff and potential soil erosion are not short-term concerns. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Forest restoration on steep slopes after coal surface mining in Appalachian USA: Soil grading and seeding effects,Forest Ecology and Management,10.1016/j.foreco.2012.01.018

The goal of this study was to use the first national field inventory of litter and humic layer depths, along with FWD volumes, to assess their basic attributes (e.g., depths/volumes) and refine NGHGI approaches to FF C stock monitoring. Results suggest that FF C stocks are present in nearly 99% of US forests with a median estimate of 25.6. Mg/ha, albeit with tremendous spatial variation in litter/humic depths and FWD volumes. Relative to aboveground live tree biomass C stocks, which typically range from 20 to 200. Mg/ha, nearly a quarter of US forests have minor FF C stocks (<14. Mg/ha), while approximately 10% of US forests may have substantial FF C stocks (>93. Mg/ha). Conditions conducive to large FF C stocks may be stochastic disturbance events that result in high volumes of FWD and/or climatic/physiographic conditions that slow decomposition (e.g., peatland ecosystems found in northern or coastal forest ecosystems). As soil and dead wood field inventories may only sample litter/humic depths and FWD counts by diameter class, C stock estimation procedures are heavily reliant on estimation constants (e.g., bulk/wood density). It was found that the variability in estimation constants may have a much stronger effect on resulting FF C stock estimates than the field measurements (e.g., litter layer depths) themselves. The monitoring of FF C stocks, along with the maintenance of site productivity and associated ecosystem services, would benefit from refined sample protocols in ecosystems with deep humic layers and coupling field data with lab analysis of bulk/wood density and C content from soil sampling programs. © 2011.",An empirical assessment of forest floor carbon stock components across the United States,Forest Ecology and Management,10.1016/j.foreco.2011.12.041

The fruits contain embelin (a benzoquinone derivative), which has wide clinical applications. Considering the importance, growing use and decreasing populations in some areas of its natural habitat, a study on development of sustainable harvesting practices of E. tsjeriam-cottam fruits was conducted in Chhattisgarh, in central India. Experiments were laid out in Dhamtari, Marvahi and Bilaspur forest divisions of the state covering both protected and open forests in a randomized design with three replications. At each site, quadrats of 40 × 20 m were laid out to study the effect of two fruit harvesting methods and four harvesting intensities on fruit yield, and regeneration of the species. Fruits were analyzed for their embelin content by HPLC method. This study is the first to experimentally assess the consequences of harvesting of E. tsjeriam-cottam fruits from India. It was found that up to 70% fruits could be hand plucked at the right time of maturity (December) to obtain quality produce without impacting the current population size. Since every year is not a good fruiting year, it is difficult to develop universal harvest regime for sustainable management of E. tsjeriam-cottam.

We used demographic data spanning 16 years from ten unharvested control sites and ten harvest sites which were divided into three treatments with differing harvest intensity: (1) dense spruce forests, where half of the total tree basal area (TBA) was cut, (2) sparse spruce forests, where one-fourth of the spruce TBA was cut and (3) sparse broadleaf forests, where one-fourth of the total TBA was cut. The effects of harvesting on different demographic rates (ramet density, reproduction, survival, and dormancy) were studied with generalized linear mixed models with harvest intensity, time since harvest and the starting level of the response variable as explanatory variables. Tree removal sites had 2.2 times higher orchid ramet density, 2.4 times higher odds of survival, and 2.13.1 times higher odds of flowering and fruiting than the control sites, but these effects were not seen at all treatment levels at all times. Tree removal had no effect on dormancy or seedling or flower density. Orchid flowering and fruiting probabilities increased only at the most intensively harvested sites (both spruce forest sites, and dense spruce forest with 50% TBA removal, respectively), while survival and ramet density increased at the moderately harvested broadleaf forest sites. The effects on flowering and fruiting probabilities and survival disappeared quickly (after three years) when the canopy gaps closed, whereas ramet density responded only with a lag of over three years and was maintained to the end of the study. Our results thus demonstrate that for the lady's slipper orchid, selective tree harvest might be a suitable management method that increases population size at the ramet level.","Tree removal as a management strategy for the lady's slipper orchid, a flagship species for herb-rich forest conservation",Forest Ecology and Management,10.1016/j.foreco.2017.09.056

These values of deadwood quantity and quality are comparable to or even higher than in other deciduous and coniferous forest reserves across Europe. With respect to the spatial distribution of deadwood, we found two patterns of tree fall: (1) wind disturbances resulted in uniformly oriented lying deadwood (i.e., logs having similar orientation), and (2) small-scale, stand-internal mortality causing rather randomly oriented logs. Traces of former management are still visible in the study plots, and the investigated forest reserves do not feature the characteristics of virgin forests yet.

We evaluate whether drainage area, channel width, and channel slope influence instream wood load in unmanaged forests across bioclimatic regions. Here we show that, without accounting for variations across regions, these numeric variables do not correlate significantly with wood loads. When accounting for the influence of all available potential influences on wood load in unmanaged forest rivers, bioclimatic region, drainage area, and channel width are the dominant predictors of wood load, and the relationship between wood load and channel width differs between regions. Combining data across bioclimatic regions, unmanaged rivers have significantly greater wood loads than lightly managed forests. Splitting data by bioclimatic region, unmanaged rivers in the northern dry conifer and northern wet conifer regions have significantly greater wood loads than lightly managed forests, but wood loads in the northern wet deciduous region do not differ between unmanaged and lightly managed forests. Our findings suggest that (i) bioclimatic region is a critical factor in predicting and understanding wood dynamics in rivers, (ii) even historic or relatively light levels of timber harvest and wood removal can create persistent differences in wood loads, and (iii) substantial variation in wood load among river segments within a bioclimatic region suggests that riparian forest and river management should focus on processes that maintain wood loads capable of creating desired physical and ecological effects rather than specified volumes of wood.",Instream large wood loads across bioclimatic regions,Forest Ecology and Management,10.1016/j.foreco.2017.09.013

We also used drift fences along the edges between uncut control forest and clearcut to detect changes in movements between treatments after timber harvest, which is one potential mechanism for differences in captures among timber harvest treatments. We found that habitat variables best predicted captures of small snakes, while both habitat and timber harvest treatment predicted lizard captures. Two lizard taxa (Plestiodon spp., Sceloporus undulatus) had higher captures in clearcuts than in the no harvest control, which is consistent with studies across the southeastern United States. Plestiodon spp. showed significantly more movements into clearcuts from control forest than in the opposite direction, demonstrating that higher captures in clearcuts were at least in part due to immigration from adjacent forested areas. Small snakes and Sceloporus undulatus captures were higher in areas with more coarse down wood and higher herbaceous vegetation cover, which were associated with the clearcut plots. These results for small snakes are consistent with another study in Missouri, but in contrast to two from South Carolina, indicating that there may be regional differences in the response of small snakes to forestry practices.

Overall wood density and MOE increased with temperature and precipitation regardless of species. In addition, a uniform latitudinal gradient related to climate was observed in paper birch and trembling aspen. Conversely, spatial distribution in wood density and MOE was not uniform in softwoods, suggesting a more limited environmental adaptability in comparison to the hardwood species studied. The natural variability of wood density and MOE in these species is now known for the study area. Regional estimates are thus available for various decision-making processes related to forest management, wood allocation, timber market value, protection priorities in firefighting and insect pest control, and forest carbon estimation.",Regional variation in wood density and modulus of elasticity of Quebec's main boreal tree species,Forest Ecology and Management,10.1016/j.foreco.2017.06.019

Rare lichens may be particularly vulnerable to effects of climate change, and conserving lichen diversity necessitates understanding factors that limit species distributions. Habitat suitability envelopes for lichens are shifting as the climate changes, but it is unclear whether and how local (e.g., within-tree) lichen species distributions will shift. Conserving lichen biodiversity also requires effective field surveys to detect and monitor rare lichen populations. However, the reliability of rare lichen survey methods currently used across global forest lands is rarely tested. In this study, we quantify the canopy distribution of an epiphytic old-growth forest cyanolichen near its southern range limit and test whether ground surveys reliably detect canopy populations. Near its southern range limit, Lobaria oregana was most abundant in two distinct zones within tree crowns: on branches of large trees in the mid-crown, and on boles of small trees near ground level. The abundance of this species near ground level suggests that lichens may benefit from cooler, wetter microclimates near the equatorial edges of their ranges. Maintaining these microclimate habitats may be a key to long-term viability of rear edge lichen populations. Targeted ground surveys reliably detected L. oregana in litterfall underneath trees where it was abundant in the crowns. However, ground surveys did not reliably detect the lichen underneath trees when it occurred in the crowns in low abundance. Our results suggest that ground surveys are useful for characterizing abundant lichen species, but that canopy surveys (e.g., tree climbing) may be needed to reliably detect lichens when they occur at low abundance.",Canopy distribution and survey detectability of a rare old-growth forest lichen,Forest Ecology and Management,10.1016/j.foreco.2017.03.007

We present a population projection for the emperor penguin population of Terre Adélie, Antarctica, by linking demographic models (stage-structured, seasonal, nonlinear, two-sex matrix population models) to sea ice forecasts from an ensemble of IPCC climate models. Based on maximum likelihood capture-mark-recapture analysis, we find that seasonal sea ice concentration anomalies (SIC a) affect adult survival and breeding success. Demographic models show that both deterministic and stochastic population growth rates are maximized at intermediate values of annual SIC a, because neither the complete absence of sea ice, nor heavy and persistent sea ice, would provide satisfactory conditions for the emperor penguin. We show that under some conditions the stochastic growth rate is positively affected by the variance in SIC a. We identify an ensemble of five general circulation climate models whose output closely matches the historical record of sea ice concentration in Terre Adélie. The output of this ensemble is used to produce stochastic forecasts of SIC a, which in turn drive the population model. Uncertainty is included by incorporating multiple climate models and by a parametric bootstrap procedure that includes parameter uncertainty due to both model selection and estimation error. The median of these simulations predicts a decline of the Terre Adélie emperor penguin population of 81% by the year 2100. We find a 43% chance of an even greater decline, of 90% or more. The uncertainty in population projections reflects large differences among climate models in their forecasts of future sea ice conditions. One such model predicts population increases over much of the century, but overall, the ensemble of models predicts that population declines are far more likely than population increases. We conclude that climate change is a significant risk for the emperor penguin.

1180,general,Temperature-related shifts in butterfly phenology depend on the habitat,Florian Altermatt,globalchangebiology,2012,2012,2,Threatening mechanism,0,No response,NA,24,6.91,"Many species are becoming active earlier in the season as the climate becomes warmer. In parallel to phenological responses to climate change, many species have also been affected by habitat changes due to anthropogenic land use. As habitat type can directly affect microclimatic conditions, concurrent changes in climate and habitat could have interacting effects on the phenology of species. Temperature-related shifts in phenology, however, have mostly been studied independent of habitat types. Here, I used long-term data from a highly standardized monitoring program with 519 transects to study how phenology of butterflies is affected by ambient temperature and habitat type. I compared forests, agricultural areas and settlements, reflecting three major land use forms, and considered butterfly species that were observed in all three of these habitats. Seasonal appearance of the butterflies was affected both by the ambient temperature and the habitat type. As expected, warmer temperatures led to an overall advancement of the appearance and flight period of most species. Surprisingly, however, phenology of species was delayed in settlement habitats, even though this habitat type is generally associated with higher temperatures. A possible explanation is dispersal among habitat types, such that source-sink effects affect local phenology. When there is little productivity in settlement areas, observed butterflies may have immigrated from forest or agricultural habitats and thus appear later in settlements. My findings suggest that a spillover of individuals among habitats may affect phenology trends and indicate that phenological studies need to be interpreted in the context of habitat types. This becomes especially important when defining strategies to prevent or mitigate effects of climate and land-use changes on phenology and abundance of species. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Temperature-related shifts in butterfly phenology depend on the habitat,Global Change Biology,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02727.x

Epiphytic lichens decline in abundance and diversity in areas with high N loads, and the abundance of lichens decreases along gradients of increased deposition. Thus, although N is an essential nutrient for lichens, excessive loads may be detrimental for them. However, these gradients include many correlated pollutants and the mechanisms behind the decline are thus poorly known. The aim of this study was to assess effects of N deposition, alone, on the epiphytic lichen community composition in a naturally N-poor boreal forest. For this purpose, whole spruce trees were fertilized daily with N at five levels, equivalent to 0.6, 6, 12.5, 25, and 50 kg N ha -1 yr -1, during four consecutive growing seasons (2006-2009), and changes in the abundance of lichens were monitored each autumn from the preceding year (2005). The studied lichen communities were highly dynamic and responded strongly to the environmental perturbation. N deposition detectably altered the direction of succession and reduced the species richness of the epiphytic lichen communities, even at the lowest fertilization application (6 kg N ha -1 yr -1). The simulated N deposition caused significant changes in the abundance of Alectoria sarmentosa, Bryoria spp., and Hypogymnia physodes, which all increased at low N loads and decreased at high loads, but with species-specific optima. The rapid decline of A. sarmentosa may have been caused by the added nitrogen reducing the stability of the lichen thalli, possibly due to increases in the photobiont: mycobiont ratio or parasitic fungal attacks. We conclude that increases in nitrogen availability, per se, could be responsible for the reductions in lichen abundance and diversity observed along deposition gradients, and those community responses may be due to physiological responses of the individual species rather than changes in competitive interactions. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Nitrogen deposition drives lichen community changes through differential species responses,Global Change Biology,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02723.x

Zeh,globalchangebiology,2012,2012,2,Threatening mechanism,0,No response,NA,19,6.91,"Although climate change models predict relatively modest increases in temperature in the tropics by the end of the century, recent analyses identify tropical ectotherms as the organisms most at risk from climate warming. Because metabolic rate in ectotherms increases exponentially with temperature, even a small rise in temperature poses a physiological threat to tropical ectotherms inhabiting an already hot environment. If correct, the metabolic theory of climate warming has profound implications for global biodiversity, since tropical insects and arachnids constitute the vast majority of animal species. Predicting how climate change will translate into fitness consequences for tropical arthropods requires an understanding of the effects of temperature increase on the entire life history of the species. Here, in a comprehensive case study of the fitness consequences of the projected temperature increase for the tropics, we conducted a split-brood experiment on the neotropical pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides, in which 792 offspring from 33 females were randomly assigned at birth to control- and high-temperature treatments for rearing through the adult stage. The diurnally varying, control treatment temperature was determined from long-term, average daily temperature minima and maxima in the pseudoscorpion's native habitat. In the high temperature treatment, increasing temperature by the 3.5 °C predicted for the tropics significantly reduced survival and accelerated development at the cost of reduced adult size and a dramatic decrease in level of sexual dimorphism. The most striking effects, however, involved reproductive traits. Reared at high temperature, males produced 45% as many sperm as control males, and females failed to reproduce. Sequencing of the mitochondrial ND2 gene revealed two highly divergent haplogroups that differed substantially in developmental rate and survivorship but not in reproductive response to high temperature. Our findings suggest that reproduction may be the Achilles' heel of tropical ectotherms, as climate warming subjects them to an increasingly adverse thermal environment. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Degrees of disruption: Projected temperature increase has catastrophic consequences for reproduction in a tropical ectotherm,Global Change Biology,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02640.x

However, a comprehensive understanding of how elevated N availability affects soil microbial processes and community dynamics remains incomplete. The mechanisms responsible for the observed responses are poorly resolved and we do not know if soil microbial communities respond in a similar manner across ecosystems. We collected 28 soils from a broad range of ecosystems in North America, amended soils with inorganic N, and incubated the soils under controlled conditions for 1 year. Consistent across nearly all soils, N addition decreased microbial respiration rates, with an average decrease of 11% over the year-long incubation, and decreased microbial biomass by 35%. High-throughput pyrosequencing showed that N addition consistently altered bacterial community composition, increasing the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, and decreasing the relative abundance of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. Further, N-amended soils consistently had lower activities in a broad suite of extracellular enzymes and had decreased temperature sensitivity, suggesting a shift to the preferential decomposition of more labile C pools. The observed trends held across strong gradients in climate and soil characteristics, indicating that the soil microbial responses to N addition are likely controlled by similar wide-spread mechanisms. Our results support the hypothesis that N addition depresses soil microbial activity by shifting the metabolic capabilities of soil bacterial communities, yielding communities that are less capable of decomposing more recalcitrant soil carbon pools and leading to a potential increase in soil carbon sequestration rates. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Consistent effects of nitrogen amendments on soil microbial communities and processes across biomes,Global Change Biology,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02639.x

Assisted colonization is one such strategy that has been predominantly discussed in terms of the costs of introducing potential competitors into new communities and the benefits of reducing extinction risk. However, the success or failure of assisted colonization will depend on a range of population-level factors that have not yet been quantitatively evaluated - the quality of the recipient habitat, the number and life stages of translocated individuals, the establishment of translocated individuals in their new habitat and whether the recipient habitat is subject to ongoing threats all will play an important role in population persistence. In this article, we do not take one side or the other in the debate over whether assisted colonization is worthwhile. Rather, we focus on the likelihood that assisted colonization will promote population persistence in the face of climate-induced distribution changes and altered fire regimes for a rare endemic species. We link a population model with species distribution models to investigate expected changes in populations with climate change, the impact of altered fire regimes on population persistence and how much assisted colonization is necessary to minimize risk of decline in populations of Tecate cypress, a rare endemic tree in the California Floristic Province, a biodiversity hotspot. We show that assisted colonization may be a risk-minimizing adaptation strategy when there are large source populations that are declining dramatically due to habitat contractions, multiple nearby sites predicted to contain suitable habitat, minimal natural dispersal, high rates of establishment of translocated populations and the absence of nonclimatic threats such as altered disturbance regimes. However, when serious ongoing threats exist, assisted colonization is ineffective. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Evaluation of assisted colonization strategies under global change for a rare, fire-dependent plant",Global Change Biology,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02586.x

Because bogs receive their nutrients from the atmosphere, the world-wide increase of nitrogen (N) deposition is expected to affect litter decomposition and, ultimately, the rate of C accumulation. However, the mechanism of such biogeochemical alteration remains unclear and quantification of the effect of N addition on litter accumulation has yet to be done. Here, we show that 7 years of N addition to a bog decreased the C : N ratio, increased the bacterial biomass and stimulated the activity of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes in surface peat. Furthermore, N addition modified nutrient limitation of microbes during litter decomposition so that phosphorus became a primary limiting nutrient. Alteration of N release from decomposing litter affected bog water chemistry and the competitive balance between peat-forming mosses and vascular plants. We estimate that deposition of about 4 g N m -2 yr -1 will cause a mean annual reduction of fresh litter C accumulation of about 40 g m -2 primarily as a consequence of decreased litter production from peat-forming mosses. Our findings show that N deposition interacts with both above and below ground components of biodiversity to threaten the ability of bogs to act as N-sinks, which may offset the positive effects of N on C accumulation seen in other ecosystems. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",High nitrogen deposition alters the decomposition of bog plant litter and reduces carbon accumulation,Global Change Biology,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02585.x

Limited field-based and remote-sensing observations have suggested complex spatial patterns related to geographic features that influence climate. However, much of this variability occurs at spatial scales that inhibit a detailed understanding of even the dominant drivers. Recognizing these limitations, we used nonlinear inverse modeling of medium-resolution remote sensing data, organized by day of year, to explore the influence of climate-related landscape factors on the timing of spring and autumn leaf-area trajectories in mid-Atlantic, USA forests. We also examined the extent to which declining summer greenness (greendown) degrades the precision and accuracy of observations of autumn offset of greenness. Of the dominant drivers of landscape phenology, elevation was the strongest, explaining up to 70% of the spatial variation in the onset of greenness. Urban land cover was second in importance, influencing spring onset and autumn offset to a distance of 32 km from large cities. Distance to tidal water also influenced phenological timing, but only within ~5 km of shorelines. Additionally, we observed that (i) growing season length unexpectedly increases with increasing elevation at elevations below 275 m; (ii) along gradients in urban land cover, timing of autumn offset has a stronger effect on growing season length than does timing of spring onset; and (iii) summer greendown introduces bias and uncertainty into observations of the autumn offset of greenness.

In practice, however, it is unknown how effective PAs will be in shielding native species from invasions under projected climate change.

We use this information to evaluate the combined threat posed by climate change and invasions to existing PAs and the most susceptible species they shelter. We found that only a quarter of Europe's marine and terrestrial areas protected over the last 100 years have been colonized by any of the invaders investigated, despite offering climatically suitable conditions for invasion. In addition, hotspots of invasive species and the most susceptible native species to their establishment do not match at large continental scales. Furthermore, the predicted richness of invaders is 11%18% significantly lower inside PAs than outside them. Invasive species are rare in long-established national parks and nature reserves, which are actively protected and often located in remote and pristine regions with very low human density. In contrast, the richness of invasive species is high in the more recently designated Natura 2000 sites, which are subject to high human accessibility. This situation may change in the future, since our models anticipate important shifts in species ranges toward the north and east of Europe at unprecedented rates of 1455 km/decade, depending on taxonomic group and scenario. This may seriously compromise the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Hydrographic and biogeochemical data from two fjord systems adjacent to the Greenland ice sheet, suggest that marine ecosystem productivity is very differently regulated in fjords influenced by either land-terminating or marine-terminating glaciers. Rising subsurface meltwater plumes originating from marine-terminating glaciers entrain large volumes of ambient deep water to the surface. The resulting upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water sustains a high phytoplankton productivity throughout summer in the fjord with marine-terminating glaciers. In contrast, the fjord with only land-terminating glaciers lack this upwelling mechanism, and is characterized by lower productivity. Data on commercial halibut landings support that coastal regions influenced by large marine-terminating glaciers have substantially higher marine productivity.

Soil warming caused rapid permafrost thaw and increased ecosystem respiration (Reco), gross primary productivity (GPP), and net summer CO2 storage (NEE). Over 7 years Reco, GPP, and NEE also increased in Control (i.e., ambient plots), but this change could be explained by slow thaw in Control areas. In the initial stages of thaw, Reco, GPP, and NEE increased linearly with thaw across all treatments, despite different rates of thaw. As thaw in Soil warming continued to increase linearly, ground surface subsidence created saturated microsites and suppressed Reco, GPP, and NEE. However Reco and GPP remained high in areas with large Eriophorum vaginatum biomass. In general NEE increased with thaw, but was more strongly correlated with plant biomass than thaw, indicating that higher Reco in deeply thawed areas during summer months was balanced by GPP. Summer CO2 flux across treatments fit a single quadratic relationship that captured the functional response of CO2 flux to thaw, water table depth, and plant biomass. These results demonstrate the importance of indirect thaw effects on CO2 flux: plant growth and water table dynamics.

While mortality from acute destructive events is often obvious and easy to measure, estimating recovery rates and investigating the factors that influence them requires long-term commitment. Coastal development is increasing in many regions, and sea surface temperatures are also rising.

We compared coral recovery rates in two periods: 7 years before and 7 years after an acute and widespread heat stress event on the GBR in 2002. From 2003 to 2009, there were few acute disturbances in the region, allowing us to attribute the observed shortfall in coral recovery rates to residual effects of acute heat stress plus other chronic stressors. Compared with the period before 2002, the recovery of fast-growing Acroporidae and of Other slower growing hard corals slowed after 2002, doubling the time taken for modest levels of recovery. If this persists, recovery times will be increasing at a time when acute disturbances are predicted to become more frequent and intense.

For the increasing future fire regime, the production of new RPyC generally outpaced the warming-induced accelerated loss of existing RPyC, so that PyC cycling decreased atmospheric CO2 between 2000 and 2300 for most estimates (by 48 Pg C for Central). For the stable fire regime, however, PyC cycling usually increased atmospheric CO2 (by 19 Pg C for Central), and only the most extreme choice of parameters maximizing PyC production and minimizing PyC decomposition led to atmospheric CO2 decreases under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 (by 58 Pg C). Our results suggest that PyC cycling will likely reduce the future increase in atmospheric CO2 if landscape fires become much more frequent; however, in the absence of a substantial increase in fire frequency, PyC cycling might contribute to, rather than mitigate, the future increase in atmospheric CO2.",The global pyrogenic carbon cycle and its impact on the level of atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> over past and future centuries,Global Change Biology,10.1111/gcb.13603

We present growing season soil chamber methane emission (FCH4), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary production (GPP) fluxes from a 9-years water table manipulation experiment in an Alaskan rich fen. The study included major flood and drought years, where wetting and drying treatments further modified the severity of droughts. Results support previous findings from peatlands that drought causes reduced magnitude of growing season FCH4, GPP and NEE, thus reducing or reversing their C sink function. Experimentally exacerbated droughts further reduced the capacity for the fen to act as a C sink by causing shifts in vegetation and thus reducing magnitude of maximum growing season GPP in subsequent flood years by ~15% compared to control plots. Conversely, water table position had only a weak influence on ER, but dominant contribution to ER switched from autotrophic respiration in wet years to heterotrophic in dry years. Droughts did not cause inter-annual lag effects on ER in this rich fen, as has been observed in several nutrient-poor peatlands. While ER was dependent on soil temperatures at 2 cm depth, FCH4 was linked to soil temperatures at 25 cm. Inter-annual variability of deep soil temperatures was in turn dependent on wetness rather than air temperature, and higher FCH4 in flooded years was thus equally due to increased methane production at depth and decreased methane oxidation near the surface. Short-term fluctuations in wetness caused significant lag effects on FCH4, but droughts caused no inter-annual lag effects on FCH4. Our results show that frequency and severity of droughts and floods can have characteristic effects on the exchange of greenhouse gases, and emphasize the need to project future hydrological regimes in rich fens.",A decade of boreal rich fen greenhouse gas fluxes in response to natural and experimental water table variability,Global Change Biology,10.1111/gcb.13612

Updated data derived from 114 peer-reviewed publications with 520 field measurements were synthesized using meta-analysis procedure to examine the N fertilizer-induced soil NO and the combined NO+N2O emissions across global soils. Besides factors identified in earlier reviews, additional factors responsible for NO fluxes were fertilizer type, soil C/N ratio, crop residue incorporation, tillage, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, drought and biomass burning. When averaged across all measurements, soil NO-N fluxes were estimated to be 4.06 kg ha-1 yr-1, with the greatest (9.75 kg ha-1 yr-1) in vegetable croplands and the lowest (0.11 kg ha-1 yr-1) in rice paddies. Soil NO emissions were more enhanced by synthetic N fertilizer (+38%), relative to organic (+20%) or mixed N (+18%) sources. Compared with synthetic N fertilizer alone, synthetic N fertilizer combined with nitrification inhibitors substantially reduced soil NO emissions by 81%. The global mean direct emission factors of N fertilizer for NO (EFNO) and combined NO+N2O (EFc) were estimated to be 1.16% and 2.58%, with 95% confidence intervals of 0.711.61% and 1.813.35%, respectively. Forests had the greatest EFNO (2.39%). Within the croplands, the EFNO (1.71%) and EFc (4.13%) were the greatest in vegetable cropping fields. Among different chemical N fertilizer varieties, ammonium nitrate had the greatest EFNO (2.93%) and EFc (5.97%). Some options such as organic instead of synthetic N fertilizer, decreasing N fertilizer input rate, nitrification inhibitor and low irrigation frequency could be adopted to mitigate soil NO emissions.

In boreal forests, compositional shifts from late-successional conifers to early-successional conifers and deciduous broadleaves have been postulated based on increased fire frequency associated with climate change truncating stand age-dependent succession. However, little is known about how climate change has affected forest composition in the background between successive catastrophic fires in boreal forests. Using 1797 permanent sample plots from western boreal forests of Canada measured from 1958 to 2013, we show that after accounting for stand age-dependent succession, the relative abundances of early-successional deciduous broadleaves and early-successional conifers have increased at the expense of late-successional conifers with climate change. These background compositional shifts are persistent temporally, consistent across all forest stand ages and pervasive spatially across the region. Rising atmospheric CO2 promoted early-successional conifers and deciduous broadleaves, and warming increased early-successional conifers at the expense of late-successional conifers, but compositional shifts were not associated with climate moisture index.

Management of invasive populations often requires frequent, broadscale, expensive control, which must be justified by demonstrating progress in achieving conservation objectives. This study evaluates benefits of regular extensive control of an invasive herbivore and develops an alternative strategy based on damage thresholds. We carried out replicated experimental management of brushtail possums, Trichosurus vulpecula, in three areas of native forest in New Zealand. Each area included a site that had extensive possum control for 10 years, prior to and during the 5-year study, and a paired site with no control. We measured indices of possum browse on c.2400 possum 'preferred' and c.1200 'non-preferred' trees, and an index of possum abundance, at the beginning and end of the experiment. Extensive control was effective in reducing possum browse on preferred tree species. Reductions in browse led to increased foliage cover and decreased probability of tree mortality. The probability of browse on an individual tree decreased with increasing amounts of possum-preferred foliage on nearby trees but increased with tree size and with increasing levels of browse on nearby trees. At one site where possum control ceased prematurely, foliage cover decreased, reducing benefits from earlier control. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides evidence that sustained, extensive control of invasive herbivores can result in significant conservation benefits to susceptible tree species, and that both impacts and benefits can be measured using data typically collected in herbivore impact studies. Furthermore, it shows how local factors such as forest composition can influence the impact of herbivory, how this can be included in large-scale assessments of the benefits of pest control and how site- and species-specific damage thresholds can be derived for improving pest management.

The proportion of threatened epiphyte species is high, and the impact of clearcuts on key demographic processes via edge-influence is still poorly understood. There are few studies on epiphyte growth, and even less is known about how reproduction is affected by proximity to forest edges. For retention trees, demographic studies are even scarcer. Based on the results from a 6-month transplant experiment and a 3-year study of natural colonies, we modelled growth and reproduction of epiphytic bryophytes used as indicators of old-growth forests and widespread epiphytes in relation to distance from the forest edge. We also modelled growth and reproduction on retention trees within the clearcut. Species responses were linked to variation in canopy openness. Unlike the widespread species, the old-growth-forest indicators grew exponentially with distance from the edge, and this response was more pronounced at the south-east than north-west forest edge. In one red-listed species, reproduction was thoroughly inhibited near the edge, whereas the reproductive rate of the widespread species tended to increase. However, the widespread species also showed reduced shoot lengths on the retention trees. Reduced growth and inhibited reproduction of sensitive epiphytes near edges decrease the number of dispersing diaspores and may, in combination with lower local connectivity and increased tree fall rates close to edges, increase the risk of metapopulation extinction. Synthesis and applications. Two general management implications for boreal forests are drawn. First, retention trees may not have the capacity to act as a 'lifeboat' for epiphytic bryophytes and support their populations during the regeneration phase. Second, the creation of buffer zones is a useful conservation strategy for bryophytes. The exact width of zones depends on the forest structure and should be orientated in relation to the requirements of the most sensitive species. For the rather dense experimental forest, a width of at least 30 m was required for the south-facing buffer, whereas for the north-facing buffer 10 m was sufficient.

Numerous revegetation efforts have attempted to restore seagrasses. Most restoration programmes use plants collected from the field because of limited seed availability, low seedling survival and difficulty in culturing plants. However, this practice risks damage to donor populations and has the potential to reduce genetic diversity, which may counteract the desired effects of restoration. A novel aquaculture system for producing plants (mother plants and cuttings) from a limited number of seeds was tested using Cymodocea nodosa as model species. The ability of transplanted cuttings to survive and grow in the natural habitat was also evaluated. Seed germination was high (48%) compared with field conditions, and most seedlings produced mother plants with up to 7·8 m of rhizome and 300 shoots within 4 years in culture. All cuttings from mother plants regenerated new plants. Up to 100 transplants were produced from two seeds, and most (85%) of them survived and initiated the colonization of substrate, 1 year after planting. Synthesis and applications. This study provides a robust protocol that can reduce plant and/or seed collection pressure on donor populations and produce a high number of transplants which show lower mortality rates during the early transplantation phases. This method can also help to preserve genetic diversity in restored populations, which should be one of the major goals of ecological restoration. This novel tool can be applied to other seagrass species with low or unpredictable reproductive success, therefore the development of nurseries should be incorporated in future restoration programmes.

Boyce,journalofappliedecology,2012,2012,2,Threatening mechanism,0,No response,NA,41,4.74,"Roads cause functional habitat loss, alter movement patterns and can become ecological traps for wildlife. Many of the negative effects of roads are likely to be a function of the human use of roads, not the road itself. However, few studies have examined the effect of temporally and spatially varying traffic patterns on large mammals, which could lead to misinterpretations about the impact of roads on wildlife. We developed models of traffic volume for an entire road network in south-western Alberta, Canada, and documented for the first time the response of grizzly bears Ursus arctos L to a wide range of traffic levels. Traffic patterns caused a clear behavioural shift in grizzly bears, with increased use of areas near roads and movement across roads during the night when traffic was low. Bears selected areas near roads travelled by fewer than 20 vehicles per day and were more likely to cross these roads. Bears avoided roads receiving moderate traffic (20-100 vehicles per day) and strongly avoided high-use roads (>100 vehicles per day) at all times. Synthesis and applications. Grizzly bear responses to traffic caused a departure from typical behavioural patterns, with bears in our study being largely nocturnal. In addition, bears selected private agricultural land, which had lower traffic levels, but higher road density, over multi-use public land. These results improve our understanding of bear responses to roads and can be used to refine management practices. Future management plans should employ a multi-pronged approach aimed at limiting both road density and traffic in core habitats. Access management will be critical in such plans and is an important tool for conserving threatened wildlife populations. © 2012 The Authors.

Despite an increase in the rate of damaging bird strikes, necessary steps to develop a mitigation method outside of the airport environment have not been empirically tested. 2.We assessed whether use of aircraft lighting might enhance detection of and reaction to the approach of an aircraft in flight by Canada geese Branta canadensis Linnaeus, a species responsible for a high rate of damaging bird strikes. We used a novel approach by estimating the visibility to the goose visual system of a standard radio-controlled (RC) aircraft (standard aircraft) exhibiting either a 2-Hz alternating pulse of two lights, or lights off; and another RC aircraft designed to mimic a raptor (predator model). We then exposed wing-clipped Canada geese to the approach of each aircraft and quantified behavioural responses to respective treatments. 3.Estimates of chromatic and achromatic contrasts indicated that the standard aircraft with lights on was more salient to the visual system of the Canada goose than with lights off or the predator model. 4.At individual and group levels, quicker alert responses were observed to the standard aircraft with lights compared with the lights off and predator model. Goose groups showed similar responses to approaches by the standard aircraft and the predator model, suggesting use of antipredator behaviour to avoid the aircraft. 5.Synthesis and applications. Understanding animal sensory ecology and associated behaviours can aid the development of methods exploiting certain behaviours to reduce negative human-wildlife interactions. For example, reducing the frequency of bird strikes requires the integration of wildlife management efforts within and outside of the airport environment that target species resource use and response to disturbance, with mitigation techniques focused on the aircraft. Moreover, the design of aircraft lighting systems to enhance detection and avoidance by birds is contingent upon understanding avian visual ecology and behaviour. Based on spectral sensitivity in Canada geese, aircraft-mounted lights that peak in the ultraviolet/violet range (380-400nm) are likely to produce the maximal behavioural effect.

To foster research on this topic, we assessed expert knowledge on the role of plant diversity in the generation of services at the landscape scale. 2.We developed a survey that included three levels of organization and seven components of plant diversity; four provisioning, six regulating and four cultural services; as well as three resources and three conditions among key abiotic factors that are likely to provide a contribution to service generation equalling that of plant diversity. Eighty experts in areas of biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services answered the survey. 3.The experts identified species diversity within a community and diversity of communities within the landscape as the most important levels of organization for service generation, both with positive effects. Composition and number of species were considered to be the most relevant components of plant diversity, the latter with a positive effect on services. Water availability was identified as the most important abiotic resource. 4.Our results suggest different approaches to management for sustaining the generation of services at the landscape scale. Provisioning services were perceived as largely influenced by abiotic resources and less so (although positively) by plant diversity. Regulating services were expected to strongly depend on both plant diversity and abiotic factors. A particularly strong positive effect of plant diversity was expected for the generation of cultural services. Some variation in answers could be attributed to expert background. 5.Synthesis and applications. The expert survey generated detailed information and new hypotheses on the relationship between plant diversity and services at the landscape scale. Future research is needed to test these hypotheses, yet the areas of agreement identified in this study can be used immediately, with caution, as synthetic expert knowledge at spatial scales that are relevant for management, to guide technological and policy interventions ensuring the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery.

Le Quesne and Simon Jennings,journalofappliedecology,2012,2012,2,Threatening mechanism,0,No response,NA,26,4.74,"Large-bodied species are especially vulnerable to fishing in mixed fisheries. Their effective conservation requires predictions of sensitivity and exposure to fishing mortality, but such predictions are hard to make when the population dynamics of most of these species have not been described. We present a method for assessing sensitivity and conservation management reference points using widely available life-history data. The method allows the sensitivity of all fish species in a community to be assessed in relation to conservation- and yield-based fishery reference points. Knowledge of sensitivity is used to (i) rank species by sensitivity, (ii) conduct a risk assessment to identify species potentially vulnerable to current fishing pressure and (iii) examine potential trade-offs between fishery catches and the conservation status of sensitive species. The method is applied to the Celtic Sea bottom-dwelling fish community. For the species present, conservation threshold fishing mortalities ranged from 0·05 per year for the most sensitive large elasmobranchs to over 1 per year for small teleosts. The assessment predicts that current levels of fishing mortality may place all the elasmobranchs and over a quarter of the teleosts below conservation reference points. Depending on the relative mortality rates affecting commercially targeted species and species of conservation concern, up to 65% of the potential yield-per-recruit of commercially important species may have to be forgone to reduce fishing mortality below conservation limit reference points for the most sensitive species. Synthesis and applications. The method presented provides a clear objective procedure to construct ranked species sensitivity lists that can inform management, monitoring and research. The Celtic Sea case study demonstrated that limiting fishing pressure on key commercial stocks to meet fisheries production targets may be insufficient to guarantee the persistence of more sensitive species. Management actions that effectively decouple the mortality rates on commercial species and 'conservation' species are likely to be required to make progress in relation to conservation objectives. The method would support rapid assessment of sensitivity to fishing in many regions around the world as only taxonomic lists and estimates of body size are required. © 2011 Crown copyright.

Mallik,journalofappliedecology,2012,2012,2,Threatening mechanism,1,Proposing a response,NA,18,4.74,"Clearcutting and wildfire are the two major edge-creating disturbances in boreal forests. While clearcutting retains at least a 30m buffer, wildfires burn close to streams killing most of the trees and potentially creating a different edge structure. Different edge structures are likely to support different plant assemblages. The riparian buffer and fire edge structures and their effects on plant assemblages are unknown, but they have implications for forest management that aims to harvest trees and conserve biodiversity by emulating natural disturbance. We hypothesized that environmental filters created by post-fire residual structures at the fire edge will support a different plant assemblage than the buffer edge. We further hypothesized that the fire edge with a weaker environmental filter because of post-fire residual structures and proximity to streams will result in lower depth of edge effects (DEEs) and magnitude of edge effects (MEEs) than buffer edges. We determined the structure of canopy trees, understorey cover and the near-ground microclimate by sampling 576 (5×10m) and 1820 (1×1m) quadrats along 96 transects beside 24 streams near Thunder Bay, Canada. We determined DEEs and MEEs by comparing edge variables with reference forests. We used repeated measures/factorial anovas with Tukey's post hoc tests to determine DEEs and manova for MEEs. The average microclimatic DEEs extended 8m into the buffer but only 2·5m from the fire edge. Similarly, the DEEs for plant life-forms extended 20m from the buffer edge and 5m from the fire edge. At the fire edge, the structural MEEs were significantly higher, but the microclimatic MEEs were lower than the buffer edge. We found no significant difference in the overall life-form MEEs, but shrubs, shade-tolerant herbs and grasses were increased at the buffer edge and decreased at the fire edge. Synthesis and applications. We discovered that the ecological structure at buffer and fire edges in boreal forests creates different environmental filters supporting different plant assemblages. Lower structural and microclimatic DEEs and MEEs at the fire edge result from (i) edge location, (ii) intact shrub layer and (iii) disturbance-resilient riparian vegetation. We suggest that replacing the conventional sharp edges of the riparian clear-cut buffer with 'feathered' edges by selective harvesting of trees will create wider edges mimicking wildfire legacy and will help to emulate natural disturbance for conserving biodiversity. © 2011 The Authors.

Fuller,journalofappliedecology,2012,2012,2,Threatening mechanism,1,Proposing a response,NA,29,4.74,"There is increasing evidence from local studies carried out in several parts of the world to suggest that increases in the abundance of deer may be depressing population levels of breeding woodland bird populations that are associated with dense understorey habitats. We examine whether habitat modification by deer is likely to be a factor contributing to recent large-scale population declines of woodland birds in lowland England. Novel analytical methods are applied to extensive national bird and deer monitoring data, to examine whether populations of 11 woodland bird species that are associated with dense understorey habitats in lowland England may have been depressed following increases in the abundance of three widespread and abundant deer species: Reeves' muntjac Muntiacus reevesi, roe deer Capreolus capreolus and fallow deer Dama dama. An additional four woodland bird species that are not specifically associated with understorey habitats are included as controls. For five of the 11 understorey species considered, there is evidence that increases in deer are associated with large-scale depression of abundance or population declines in lowland England. Of these species, we suggest that the impacts of deer are likely to have been greatest for two species of conservation concern, common nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos and willow tit Poecile montanus. Synthesis and applications. Large-scale analyses of extensive national monitoring data provide evidence for a negative association between three widespread and abundant deer species and several woodland bird populations that are associated with dense understorey habitats. These findings are consistent with those from small-scale experimental studies and indicate that deer-related habitat modification may be affecting some bird species on far larger scales than previously appreciated. Mainly through their effects on understorey vegetation, high deer populations are now likely to be affecting woodland biodiversity over large parts of lowland England and deer management plans, involving integrated exclusion and culling of deer, need to be co-ordinated on large scales. It is suggested that such management plans could most usefully target areas that still support relatively high populations of species that are sensitive to deer. Knowledge about the form of relationships between deer abundance and habitat quality for birds and other biodiversity is an important knowledge gap that needs to be addressed if sound, collaborative deer management plans are to be developed. © 2011 The Authors.

As a result, measuring connectivity is challenging, and often poorly integrated within conservation planning and wildlife management. To exacerbate the challenge, scale-dependent resource use makes inference across scales problematic, resource use is often modelled in areas where the species is not present, and connectivity is typically measured using a source-to-sink approach, erroneously assuming animals possess predefined destinations. Here, we used a large carnivore, the leopard Panthera pardus, to characterise resource use and landscape connectivity across a vast, biodiverse region of southern Africa. Using a range of data sets to counter data deficiencies inherent in carnivore management, we overcame methodological limitations by employing occupancy modelling and resource selection functions across three orders of selection, and estimated landscape-scale habitat connectivity  independent of a priori source and sink locations  using circuit theory. We evaluated whether occupancy modelling on its own was capable of accurately informing habitat connectivity, and identified conservation priorities necessary for applied management. We detected markedly different scale-dependent relationships across all selection orders. Our multi-data, multi-scale approach accurately predicted resource use across multiple scales and demonstrates how management authorities can more suitably utilise fragmentary data sets. We further developed an unbiased landscape-scale depiction of habitat connectivity, and identified key linkages in need of targeted management. We did not find support for the use of occupancy modelling as a proxy for landscape-scale habitat connectivity and further caution its use within a management context. Synthesis and applications. Maintaining habitat connectivity remains a fundamental component of wildlife management and conservation, yet data to inform these biological and ecological processes are often scarce. We present a robust approach that incorporates multi-scale fragmentary data sets (e.g. mortality data, permit data, sightings data), routinely collected by management authorities, to inform wildlife management and land-use planning. We recommend that management authorities employ a multi-data, multi-scale connectivity approach  as we present here  to identify management units at risk of low connectivity.","Cats, connectivity and conservation: incorporating data sets and integrating scales for wildlife management",Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/1365-2664.12851

Shackleton,journalofappliedecology,2017,2017,2,Threatening mechanism,0,No response,NA,0,5.742,"The harvesting of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is a global phenomenon, the sustainability of which has been studied for many species at the individual and population level. However, the broader scale impacts of NTFP harvesting have been acknowledged but rarely examined. We assessed plant size and the soil attributes undercanopy and in the open, in replicate, paired harvested and non-harvested sites for three NTFPs differing in the extent of biomass removed, i.e. timber for firewood from a tree (Acacia karroo), fruits from a cactus (Opunita ficus-indica) and flowering culms from a grass (Cymbopogon marginatus). Soil variables tested included pH, resistivity, P, total N, nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, K, Na, Ca and Mg. The extent of loss of soil nutrients decreased across the three NTFPs relative to the proportion of biomass removed. Thus, significant differences in more soil variables were evident for the firewood species, least for the fruit species and intermediate for the grass species. Lower soil pH, P, C and K were evident in soils collected underneath A. karroo, while losses in cations of Na, Ca and Mg were reported in soils underneath C. marginatus, and only NO3N losses were recorded underneath O. ficus-indica. Synthesis and applications. Our study reveals that while non-timber forest product (NTFP) harvesting may affect soil nutrients, this is not uniform between species and is likely to be a function of the extent of biomass removed and harvesting frequency. This indicates the need for caution in generalisations about the ecosystem-level impacts of NTFP harvesting as well as a concerted effort to better understand impacts at a greater range of scales than has been the case to date.",Ecosystem-scale impacts of non-timber forest product harvesting: effects on soil nutrients,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/1365-2664.12891

Schlacher and Rod M. Connolly,journalofappliedecology,2017,2017,1,Describing the state of nature,4,Testing response,NA,1,5.742,"Connectivity is regarded globally as a guiding principle for conservation planning, but due to difficulties in quantifying connectivity, empirical data remain scarce. Lack of meaningful connectivity metrics is likely leading to inadequate representation of important biological connections in reserve networks. Identifying patterns in landscape connectivity can, theoretically, improve the design of conservation areas. We used a network model to estimate seascape connectivity for coral reef-associated fishes in a subtropical bay in Australia. The model accounted for two scales of connectivity: (i) within mosaics at a local scale and (ii) among these mosaics at a regional scale. Connections among mosaics were modelled using estimations of post-larval small and intermediate movement distances represented by home ranges of two fish species. Modelled connectivity patterns were assessed with existing data on fish diversity. For fishes with intermediate home ranges (06 km), connectivity [quantified by the index Probability of Connectivity (dPC)] explained 5160% of species diversity. At smaller home ranges (01 km), species diversity was associated closely with intramosaic connectivity quantified by the index dPCintra. Mosaics and their region-wide connections were ranked for their contribution to overall seascape connectivity and compared against current positions and boundaries of reserves. Our matching shows that only three of the 10 most important mosaics are at least partly encompassed within a reserve, and only a single important regional connection lies within a reserve. Synthesis and applications. Notwithstanding its formal recognition in reserve planning, connectivity is rarely accounted for in practice, mainly because suitable metrics of connectivity are not available in planning phases. Here, we show how a network analysis can be effectively used in conservation planning by identifying biological connectivity inside and outside present reserve networks. Our results demonstrate clearly that connectivity is insufficiently represented within a reserve network. We also provide evidence of key pathways in need of protection to avoid nullifying the benefits of protecting key reefs. The guiding principle of protecting connections among habitats can be achieved more effectively in future, by formally incorporating our findings into the decision framework.",Prioritising seascape connectivity in conservation using network analysis,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/1365-2664.12824

Pillar,journalofappliedecology,2017,2017,2,Threatening mechanism,0,No response,NA,0,5.742,"Invasive species spread on natural ecosystems is one of the most important causes of biodiversity loss. To disentangle the invasive plant impact on communities it is essential to combine experimental and observation approaches, which enable the correct interpretations of results and lead to the right decisions for management. We examined the invasion of southern Brazil's grasslands by Eragrostis plana, which is currently the most problematic invasive species in the region. By means of an experiment on invaded communities complemented by observation of non-invaded communities, we assessed E. plana impact on vegetation, evaluated community response to its removal and discussed the effectiveness of removal methods. Fifty permanent 1 × 1 m plots were located on natural grassland that was partially invaded by E. plana. Removal was done annually from 2012 to 2015 and consisted of five treatments (n = 10): (i) clipping above-ground biomass on one occasion; (ii) clipping above-ground biomass periodically; (iii) herbicide and (iv) hand-pulling, plus (v) control treatment with no-removal. In addition, 10 plots located in an adjacent non-invaded area were monitored. All removal treatments reduced E. plana cover across years, but were not enough to eradicate it. Our results revealed not only differences between invaded and non-invaded communities, but also an effect of E. plana removal on resident species richness and total cover. At the local scale, we demonstrated the impact of E. plana invasion on grassland vegetation, suggesting a reduction in resident species richness and total cover. Invasive species removal changed communities differently from invaded ones, but not resembling non-invaded references, suggesting that community recovery may need more time for reestablishment or that some restoration strategies are required. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrated the impact on vegetation of the most important invasive species in southern Brazil's natural grasslands. We highlighted the advantages of combining observations of non-invaded communities and experimental studies on invaded communities, with and without invasive removal, to help infer causal relationships in ecological invasion research.",Invasive plant removal: assessing community impact and recovery from invasion,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/1365-2664.12848

However, studies of shading have been poorly explored from an environmental impact perspective. We compared community structure on subtropical rocky shores in areas shaded by human constructions with those in unshaded areas. We then implemented a manipulative field experiment to determine the effects of shading on the macrobenthic community, biofilm biomass and larval recruitment. Shading consistently affected the biological community of rocky shores. The biomass and cover of macroalgae and the size of most sedentary grazers were smaller in shaded habitat. In the infralittoral fringe, we recorded a shift in dominance from macroalgae in unshaded habitats to invertebrate filter feeders in shaded ones. In a similar way, the community from the mesolittoral was also affected by shading but not at all locations. Experimental manipulation of shading led to a total loss of macroalgae from the infralittoral fringe and no community replacement over a period of 220 days. In the mesolittoral, oysters became more abundant in shaded conditions, while barnacles decreased in abundance. Larval recruitment was also affected, with oysters and barnacles recruiting more in shaded habitats. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate a clear impact of shading by artificial human-made structures on patterns and processes regulating biodiversity on rocky shores and thus consequences for coastal ecosystem functioning. We argue that shading by artificial coastal structures, such as those proposed in the port expansion in our study site in south-eastern Brazil, is potentially underestimated. Our work emphasizes the importance of careful evaluations of artificial structures in order to promote sustainable coastal development. As a result, we do not recommend the proposed expansion by suspended structures of the port of São Sebastião, as the consequent shading will negatively affect the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of the Araçá Bay and surrounding areas.",Shading impacts by coastal infrastructure on biological communities from subtropical rocky shores,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/1365-2664.12811

Set against this background is the global decline of amphibians, with up to 40% of species facing extinction from multiple additive threats. Despite these disturbing figures, it is currently unclear how increasing fire frequency may impact the long-term persistence of frog populations. Following a severe wildfire in south-eastern Australia in 2009, field surveys indicated healthy tree frog populations. However, the 2009 fire had significant impacts on genetic diversity, including increased levels of inbreeding and declines in effective population size. Using stochastic population modelling under a range of fire-frequency scenarios, we demonstrate that amphibian populations in fire-prone environments may be increasingly vulnerable to extinction, particularly where rates of immigration are low. Synthesis and applications. This study of amphibian population genetics before and after a major wildfire emphasizes the importance of integrating both ecological and genetic data into population models. This will help managers make more appropriate conservation decisions regarding fire management of natural environments, especially those containing threatened populations.

Bovill,journalofappliedecology,2017,2017,1,Describing the state of nature,0,No response,NA,3,5.742,"To understand species losses from disturbed landscapes, it is important to distinguish the effects of degraded environmental conditions from those caused by barriers to dispersal between habitat patches. To assess the relative importance of these effects, we developed a new approach using permutation and association tests applied to rank abundance data, using the invertebrate fauna of two rivers in two seasons. Our study streams were Hughes Creek and Seven Creeks, in south-eastern Australia, which have both been degraded by agriculture in downstream sections. We collected benthic invertebrates and also dispersing individuals (drift, terrestrial adults) during two seasons in 20072008. Study sites spanned strong environmental gradients as well as the main dispersal route (up- and down-channel). Environmental data were analysed to set up permutation tests on rank abundances. Survey and disperser data were contrasted using contingency table analyses. The results suggest dispersal plays a strong role in community structure. Environmental effects were evident and strongest upstream, but evidence of environmental effects was weak over much of the gradient. Many species had different distributions in different data sets or dispersers that were abundant at locations distant from centres of benthic distribution. Our results differ from many studies, but few have been able to evaluate dispersal effects directly. Our method provides a practical approach for evaluating the role dispersal plays in driving species abundance patterns across landscapes, thus bridging a gap between theory and practice. Synthesis and applications. Managers typically use indices of ecosystem health that assume environmental conditions largely determine species diversity and abundance. Dispersal between habitat patches is known to be important, but there are no reliable methods to assess the role dispersal may play. We provide an approach that allows both dispersal and environmental effects on species distributions to be evaluated from survey data. This may open the way for dispersal information to be incorporated into management actions. Additionally, the approach should allow improved siting of restoration projects that depend greatly on successful dispersal of individuals for successful outcomes.",A fresh approach reveals how dispersal shapes metacommunity structure in a human-altered landscape,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/1365-2664.12759

While both the foraging activity and functional diversity of birds are enhanced by multiscale habitat heterogeneity, little is known about how these relationships may influence avian top-down control of insects. Specifically, interactive effects of bird community structure and habitat heterogeneity on pest control across spatial scales have rarely been explored. We sampled bird communities and measured avian predation on plasticine model prey, as a proxy for lepidopteran pest control, in 20 vineyards of south-western France. Vineyards differed both in sward heterogeneity at the local scale and amount of surrounding semi-natural habitats at the landscape scale. Functional diversity metrics and community-weighted mean traits were computed for bird communities based on a speciestrait table including diet, foraging method, nesting site, migration strategy, laying date, home range size, clutch size and body mass. We used mixed models to test for the interacting effects of habitat heterogeneity and bird functional diversity on avian predation rates of plasticine prey. Contrary to expectations, bird functional diversity decreased with landscape-scale heterogeneity, but was higher in vineyards managed with heterogeneous sward structures. In contrast, foliage-gleaning insectivores were more abundant in landscapes supporting more semi-natural habitats, suggesting an increase in their contribution to pest control along the landscape heterogeneity gradient. Accordingly, we found that avian predation on plasticine prey increased with bird functional evenness both in more heterogeneous vineyards at the local scale and in landscape mosaics supporting more semi-natural habitats. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that habitat heterogeneity at both local and landscape scales influenced avian insectivory in vineyard agroecosystems by interacting with bird community structure. It provides important insights for ecological intensification in vineyards, pointing out that management options need to be adapted to both the functional composition of local bird communities and landscape context. We suggest that both on-field and off-field management can be used to enhance natural pest control services provided by birds in vineyards, especially by favouring sward heterogeneity and patches of semi-natural habitats within large vineyard stands at the landscape scale.",Avian pest control in vineyards is driven by interactions between bird functional diversity and landscape heterogeneity,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/1365-2664.12740

It has since spread very rapidly and has caused significant mortality among honeybees and native entomofauna. It also poses a risk to humans because its sting provokes allergic reactions. The objectives of this study were the following: (i) to disentangle the roles played by human-mediated dispersal and self-mediated dispersal in the species' rapid range expansion and (ii) to estimate the intensity of control measures in France and determine what needs to be done to slow the hornet's spread and dramatically reduce its population densities. A mathematical model was developed to describe the hornet's potential spread. This model included parameters describing the population growth rate, carrying capacity, self-mediated dispersal, human-mediated dispersal and the efficacy of control measures (i.e. the destruction of detected nests). Model parameters were estimated using 20042009 occurrence data for France and the model was then validated using 2013 occurrence data. Several scenarios were tested: human-mediated dispersal was present or absent and control intensity varied. Then, the species' spread in coming years was simulated (from 2013 to 2020). Despite some uncertainty on the value of the parameters, this model is relatively robust. Human-mediated dispersal may not be necessarily responsible for the hornet's rapid range expansion; the species could spread rapidly on its own. It is likely that to date, an average of 3040% of detected nests have been destroyed each year. Increasing the percentage of destroyed nests from 30 to 60% could reduce the species' spread by 17% and its nest density by 29%. If 95% of nests are destroyed, the species' spread and nest density could decline by 43% and 53%, respectively. Synthesis and applications. The mathematical model developed in this study shows that human-mediated dispersal of the invasive yellow-legged hornet may not be the only factor explaining the hornet's rapid range expansion and that controlling this invasive pest is still possible. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reduce self-mediated dispersal and to intensify and improve control measures to diminish the species' impact and prevent its further spread. Control measures could combine the mechanical removal and destruction of individuals or infested materials with biological control techniques.",Rapid spread of the invasive yellow-legged hornet in France: the role of human-mediated dispersal and the effects of control measures,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/1365-2664.12724

However, little is known about how plant species ranges, richness and phylogenetic diversity of continents will be affected by these dynamics. We address this gap here by examining the patterns of species' distributions and phylogenetic relationships for 7465 seed plant taxa in North America. An ensemble of species distribution models was used to estimate the potential suitable habitat of species under different sets of climate, land-use and dispersal constraint scenarios. We then evaluated the vulnerability and extinction risk of individual species to changes in climate and land use, and examined whether rare, endangered and evolutionarily distinct species were disproportionally threatened by climate and land-use change. We show that ~2000 species may lose >80% of their suitable habitats under the A1b emission scenario for the 2080s, while ~100 species may experience >80% range expansions (a 20 : 1 ratio of loss to gain). When considering >50% range retraction and expansion, the ratio of loss to gain was 13 : 1. A greater loss of species diversity is expected at low latitudes, while larger gains are expected at high latitudes. Evolutionarily distinct species are predicted to have significantly higher extinction risks than extant species. This suggests a disproportionate future loss of phylogenetic diversity for the North American flora. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides continental-scale evidence of plant species extinction risk caused by future climate and land-use change, and highlights the importance of integrating phylogenetic measures into conservation risk assessments.

We used automatic UV light-traps to sample noctuid moths on two remote islands, and compared traits of island occupants with those of a species pool from mainland southeast Sweden. Widely distributed species, generalist species, species with a long adult activity period and species active late in the summer had higher probability of occupancy on the remote islands. The results were consistent between islands. The traits of host plant specificity and species with an adult activity period during late summer remained robust and were statistically significant after controlling for any possible phylogenetic bias. This indicates that species exhibiting those traits survive better when habitat and climate changes. It is crucial to include our results in; (1) conservation planning, e. g. when devising conservation measures in fragmented landscapes; (2) for predictions of future occupancy patterns; and (3) ecosystem impact assessments, e. g. the importance of moths as pollinators, herbivores and being the functional link between parasitoids, plants, consumers and predators. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Species traits predict island occupancy in noctuid moths,Journal of Insect Conservation,10.1007/s10841-011-9401-z

The University of Northern Iowa's Tallgrass Prairie Center is investigating the feasibility of cultivating and harvesting diverse mixes of native prairie vegetation for use as a sustainable biofuel in a manner that also conserves biodiversity and protects soil and water resources. In 2009, we established 48 research plots on three soil types at an Iowa site with a uniform history of row crop production. We seeded each plot with one of four treatments of native prairie vegetation: (1) switchgrass monoculture, (2) warm-season grass mix (5 grass species), (3) biomass mix (16 species of grasses, legumes, and forbs), or (4) prairie mix (32 species of grasses, legumes, forbs, and sedges). In 2010, we measured vegetation characteristics and studied butterfly use of the plots to investigate the hypothesis that more diverse plant communities would support a greater abundance and diversity of butterflies. Habitat characteristics varied significantly among the plots by treatment and soil type, and butterflies responded rapidly to variation in floral abundance and richness. Averaged over the entire growing season, butterflies were six times more abundant and twice as species rich in the biomass and prairie mix plots compared to the warm-season grass and switchgrass plots.

Four patch sizes were investigated: 1, 4, 25 and 100 m 2 as well as the adjacent mown and unmown areas. A range of environmental parameters relating to soil characteristics, stones and nearby vegetation were measured at each patch and control habitat in order to distinguish the effect of patch size. Results show that bare ground is a valuable habitat for carabids, but that the response of their abundance, richness and diversity to bare ground patch size depends on a large number of environmental variables on and around the patches. When all variables are taken into account, smaller patches appear to benefit carabid abundance, richness and diversity. In the presence of Molinia caerulea at the patch edges, however, larger patches were more beneficial. Given this dependence on environmental variables, the perfect patch size for conservation of biodiversity is likely to be site specific and the best approach may be to use a variety of patch sizes at a range of successional stages. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Heathland management effects on carabid beetle communities: The relationship between bare ground patch size and carabid biodiversity,Journal of Insect Conservation,10.1007/s10841-011-9438-z

Inclusion of floral resources may be particularly useful in conserving many beneficial insects, where groups including pollinators and pest natural enemies often rely on nectar and pollen during (at least part of) their life-cycle. As not all flowers are equally suited to all beneficial insects, selection of appropriate flowering plants is key to ensuring that conservation targets are met and benefits to ecosystems services realised as a result. This short paper describes an experiment conducted to assess the 'total temporal attractiveness' of a range of British wildflowers to selected functional insect groups. The results obtained demonstrate that flowering period alone is a poor indicator of plant suitability to insects, where no relationship existed between this and attraction to insects overall. Data also suggest that, based on attraction over a season, certain flowering plants are more likely to be of general insect conservation value and/or benefit to functional insect groups than others. Attraction to pest insects was also considered, with relatively high catches of thrips and pollen beetles observed in flowering stands of some plants. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Selection of floral resources to optimise conservation of agriculturally-functional insect groups,Journal of Insect Conservation,10.1007/s10841-012-9508-x

Thom and Jaret Daniels,journalofinsectconservation,2017,2017,1,Describing the state of nature,0,No response,NA,0,1.562,"The quality of habitat for a given species is fundamental to its persistence in that habitat space. Herbivorous insects often require a specific combination of host plants, floral resources, and physical features such as shelter. Identifying these different habitat features is a focus of ecology and conservation, particularly for managing rare or imperiled taxa. We investigated the patterns of microhabitat and host plant use of the rare frosted elfin butterfly, Callophrys irus, a larval host-plant specialist found in frequently disturbed sand plains, barrens, and sandhill pine-oak forests of the eastern United States. Previous studies have been conducted on populations in the Northeastern and Midwestern US, but the southern part of its range remains unstudied. Our efforts focused on a persistent C. irus colony in northeastern Florida, resulting in a geographically referenced census of larval host-plant Lupinus perennis, along with a multiple year survey of microhabitat features relevant to both C. irus adults and immatures. Results of the larval host-plant census revealed that the highest densities of host plants were located distant to the highest densities of C. irus. Hot-spot analysis confirmed the significance of this pattern, suggesting different habitat requirements for larval host-plant L. perennis and C. irus individuals in order to achieve maximum potential densities. Our survey of C. irus immatures showed a similar pattern of microhabitat affinity that was previously recorded in the Northeast and Midwestern US, including large larval host-plants, low amounts of ground cover vegetation, and the presence of some shade. Unique to our study we found that the presence of other herbivores of L. perennis such as larvae of the crambid moth Uresiphita reversalis had a negative effect on encountering C. irus immatures.

The moth Cucullia lychnitis is identified in UK legislation as a priority species for conservation. Its conspicuous larvae feed on a patchily distributed host plant Verbascum nigrum, but are entirely absent from some host plant patches within the species range. Environmental variability among patches was investigated to understand factors affecting (i) patch occupancy by C. lychnitis and (ii) abundance of C. lychnitis, where present. Occupancy of individual V. nigrum plants within occupied patches was also investigated. The likelihood of patch occupancy increased with patch size, and decreased with patch isolation. Abundance of C. lychnitis was negatively correlated with patch isolation and with abundance of the weevil Cionus nigritarsis, which exploits the same host plant and may be a competitor. Within occupied patches, larvae of C. lychnitis were significantly more likely to be found on taller plants with more flower spikes; such plants are typical of established rather than newly-created patches. These results may help to guide efforts to conserve C. lychnitis, highlighting the importance of habitat connectivity and indicating potential management actions to promote features positively associated with larval incidence and abundance.","Host-plant patch qualities and presence of a likely competitor species affect the distribution and abundance of a rare British moth, Cucullia lychnitis",Journal of Insect Conservation,10.1007/s10841-017-9963-5

The federally endangered Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis Nabokov) has faced population declines throughout its range, most recently in 2012 following a severe drought throughout the Great Lakes region. This research builds upon previous work to understand what microclimate and biotic factors predict L. m. samuelis site occupancy. To gain an understanding of what habitat characteristics are conducive to L. m. samuelis survival during severe stochastic weather events, previously occupied sites were compared with currently occupied and restored sites in Allegan State Game Area, Michigan and the Oak Openings region of Ohio using variables significant in a predictive model. The heat load variable accounted for 6467% of the variation in the model alone while individual biotic variables accounted for <5% of the model variation individually. The density of flowering lupine, ant entrance densities and heat load were higher in occupied sites while formerly occupied sites had higher woody stem density and canopy cover. These data show that site microclimate and factors affecting L. m. samuelis larval growth and reproduction affect distribution and persistence in stochastic environments. These findings can be incorporated in habitat management plans to create climate resilient refugia for current populations and increase the probability of reintroduction success in restored areas.",Microclimate and biotic interactions affect Karner blue butterfly occupancy and persistence in managed oak savanna habitats,Journal of Insect Conservation,10.1007/s10841-017-9967-1

Detailed habitat descriptions, based on fieldwork data, are given for the four species and models show relatively small and fragmented habitat patches for P. violetae, P. golgus, and P. zullichi. Those areas might be particularly sensitive under a climate change scenario. Habitat of the four species is very specialized and mainly consists of open areas with grassland or scrub vegetation. Population densities are provided for the first time for these species and show low numbers for E. bazae, particularly in the area around Baza in SE Spain. 25 to 54% of the populations were apparently not threatened. For the rest, apparent habitat suitability threats were abandonment for E. bazae and P. violetae, trampling for A. zullichi, and overgrazing for P. golgus. Recovery plans included aspects on legislation, habitat management, precautionary measures (limit new developments and land use changes), research, and public awareness campaigns.

Although the outcomes for vegetation coverage are clear, it remains unclear if these efforts also translate into broader conservation outcomes for fauna. Here we use ant communities to assess the conservation potential of vegetation undergoing natural regeneration and subject to afforestation plantings in valley-type savanna in the Hengduan Mountains of southwest China. Species richness was almost always highest in the oldest (30 year) sites irrespective of habitat type. The two sites that were monocultures of Leucaena leucocephala had notably low species richness (1 and 6 species respectively). Plant species richness had a significant positive relationship with total ant abundance and richness. The number of exotic ant species present had a negative relationship with total species richness. Multivariate analysis of species presence/absence data found no distinction between ant communities of plantation and rehabilitating sites, except for the two Leucaena plantation sites. PCA analysis of abundance data found that the separation of the sites was dependent upon the analyses conducted. We conclude that afforestation efforts are a useful conservation tool, regardless of whether these are of regenerating purely native vegetation or the creation of novel ecosystems using non-native species.

We conducted a 3-year study (2007-2009) to determine the influence of CRP on fawn ecology during a time of declining CRP enrollment. We captured and radiocollared 81 fawn white-tailed deer during 15 May to 15 June 2007-2009 in north-central South Dakota, collected 6,505 locations, and documented 70 summer home ranges. Mean summer home ranges increased temporally during 2007-2009 (P<0.001) and corresponded to a 41% loss of CRP grasslands in the area (2.3% loss in land cover and approx. 21% loss in cover habitat in the study area) over the duration of the study. Additionally, mean movement between daily locations increased (P<0.001) from 2007 to 2009. Analysis of covariance models indicated that change in CRP influenced home-range size, and change in CRP and wheat influenced daily movement. Smaller home ranges and reduced movements were associated with greater quantity of CRP available to fawns, and increased movements were associated with more acreage of wheat available to fawns. Fawns shifted resource selection during the summer at a mean age ranging from 48.8 days to 58.6 days, and this shift was associated with height of corn (83-87cm). During early summer, fawns consistently selected for CRP; selection of wheat progressed temporally from avoidance in 2007 to selection in 2009. During late summer, fawns consistently selected for corn habitat and used CRP at least in proportion to its availability. Reduction in CRP-grasslands seemed to increase fawn home-range size and daily movements and, influenced change in resource selection to wheat. Current legislation mandates continued decrease in CRP enrollment and concomitant increase in the planting of corn for ethanol production. Management of habitat throughout the grasslands of the Northern Great Plains that maximizes cover habitats would provide neonates with adequate cover for protection from predators.

Specifically, we analyzed the isotopic composition of hair from bears known a priori to be food-conditioned or non-food-conditioned and used these data to predict whether bears with an unknown management status were food-conditioned (FC) or non-food-conditioned (NFC). We used a stable isotope mixing model to estimate the proportional contribution of natural foods (plants and animals) versus human food in the diets of FC bears. We then used results from both analyses to evaluate proactive (population-level) and reactive (individual-level) human-bear management, and discussed new metrics to evaluate the overall human-bear management program in Yosemite. Our results indicated that 19 out of 145 (13%) unknown bears sampled from 2005 to 2007 were food-conditioned. The proportion of human food in the diets of known FC bears likely declined from 2001-2003 to 2005-2007, suggesting proactive management was successful in reducing the amount of human food available to bears. In contrast, reactive management was not successful in changing the management status of known FC bears to NFC bears, or in reducing the contribution of human food to the diets of FC bears. Nine known FC bears were recaptured on 14 occasions from 2001 to 2007; all bears were classified as FC during subsequent recaptures, and human-bear management did not reduce the amount of human food in the diets of FC bears.

During 1993-2000, 617 radio-marked females provided information about brood habitat use and duckling survival on 27 sites in prairie Canada. We contrasted a priori and exploratory models that incorporated effects of upland, wetland, weather, female, and brood-related variables on duckling survival rates. Survival was highest for ducklings when a greater proportion of their surrounding landscape (i.e., within a 500-m radius buffer around the brood) was comprised of wetlands characterized by a central expanse of open water and a peripheral ring of flooded emergent vegetation. Cold and wet weather in the first week of life resulted in lower duckling survival. In a post hoc analysis, duckling survival (of older ducklings) was negatively related to increasing proportions of managed hayland. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.",Landscape-level correlates of mallard duckling survival: Implications for conservation programs,Journal of Wildlife Management,10.1002/jwmg.297

The golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) is a neotropical migratory bird that was listed as federally endangered in 1990 because of threats related to loss and fragmentation of its woodland habitat. Since listing, abundance estimates for the species have mainly relied on localized population studies on public lands and qualitative-based methods. Our goal was to estimate breeding population size of male warblers using a predictive model based on metrics for patches of woodland habitat throughout the species' breeding range. We first conducted occupancy surveys to determine range-wide distribution. We then conducted standard point-count surveys on a subset of the initial sampling locations to estimate density of males. Mean observed patch-specific density was 0.23 males/ha (95% CI = 0.197-0.252, n = 301). We modeled the relationship between patch-specific density of males and woodland patch characteristics (size and landscape composition) and predicted patch occupancy. The probability of patch occupancy, derived from a model that used patch size and landscape composition as predictor variables while addressing effects of spatial relatedness, best predicted patch-specific density. We predicted patch-specific densities as a function of occupancy probability and estimated abundance of male warblers across 63,616 woodland patches accounting for 1.678 million ha of potential warbler habitat. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, our approach yielded a range-wide male warbler population estimate of 263,339 (95% CI: 223,927-302,620).

Populations of red-legged partridges in Spain have decreased in recent decades, and releases of farm-bred partridges to improve short-term availability are increasingly common. We used questionnaires and bird surveys to assess whether harvest was related to availability of wild partridges or intensity of farm-bred partridge releases. We studied 50 hunting estates, including 6 administratively labeled as intensive (with few numerical and temporal restrictions to releases). In addition, we considered hunting pressure (number of huntersá - hunting days/km 2) and habitat as explanatory variables in the analyses. In intensive estates, annual harvest was exclusively related to release intensity, indicating that in these estates hunting is detached from natural resources and approaches an industrial activity based on external inputs. In non-intensive estates, harvest was affected by wild stock availability, walked-up shooting pressure, and habitat (greater harvest in estates with more Mediterranean shrubland). In these estates, releases did not increase annual harvest, and can be considered an inefficient practice. Additionally, the relationship between abundance estimates and harvest disappeared in estates with low partridge abundance estimates, suggesting possibilities for overharvesting in a large proportion of estates. Increasing the abundance of wild red-legged partridge through techniques like habitat management, and improving the adjustment of harvest to availability, may be a good strategy to increase long-term harvest in non-intensive estates. Additionally, Government and managers must create ways to segregate and label the estates where only wild red-legged partridges are managed from those where releases are used, to reduce ecological costs of management decisions. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

Our objective was to quantify neonate survival rates and causes of mortality at the United States Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina to directly evaluate degree of predation in this deer population. From 2006 to 2009, we radio-monitored 91 neonates captured with the aid of vaginal implant transmitters in pregnant adult females and opportunistic searches. Overall Kaplan-Meier survival rate to 16 weeks of age was 0.230 (95% CI=0.155-0.328), and it varied little among years. Our best-fitting model estimated survival at 0.220 (95% CI=0.144-0.320). This model included a quadratic time trend variable (lowest survival rate during the first week of life and increasing to near 1.000 around week 10), and Julian date of birth (survival probability declining as date of birth increased). Predation by coyotes was the most frequent cause of death among the 70 monitored neonates that died, definitively accounting for 37% of all mortalities and potentially accounting for as much as 80% when also including probable coyote predation. Predation by bobcats (Felis rufus) accounted for 7% (definitive) to 9% (including probable bobcat predation) of mortalities. The level of coyote-induced mortality we observed is consistent with the low recruitment rates exhibited in the SRS deer population since establishment of coyotes at the site. If representative of recruitment rates across South Carolina, current harvest levels appear unsustainable. This understanding is consistent with the recent declining trend in the statewide deer population. The effects of coyote predation on recruitment should be considered when setting harvest goals, regardless of whether local deer population size is currently above or below desired levels, because coyotes can substantially reduce fawn recruitment.

To investigate the hypothesis that the hunt is unsustainable, we examined the sustainable human-caused mortality rate for grizzly bears using recent data on vital rates and population projection models and compare these to rates used by the management agency; examined the age and sex ratio of the kill and how the sex ratio changes with age for the entire province, each population unit, and cohorts born each year between 1977 and 1990; summarized population density estimates in hunted population units in British Columbia and compared these to unhunted areas in adjacent jurisdictions; and reviewed case studies of population units that have been highlighted as most likely to have had unsustainable kill levels. Because the natural mortality rate of adult grizzly bears is 12% and lower than was estimated when sustainable human-caused mortality targets were developed, estimated sustainable kill rates are 410%, and generally higher than the 46% used in British Columbia. We estimated that males have been 34 times more vulnerable to being killed by hunters than females, yet males dominate the kill at all ages and the proportion of males increased with age, which is opposite of what is predicted for a heavily hunted population. The average age of female and male grizzly bears killed by hunters increased from 7.1 years and 7.4 years, respectively, in the 1980s to 7.7 years and 8.7 years, respectively, in the 2000s. An average of 107.4 females and 204.9 males per cohort born between 1977 and 1990 were eventually killed by people and recorded, suggesting that many more females than males died for unknown reasons. There have been more population inventories of grizzly bears in British Columbia than in any other jurisdiction. The average density estimate of 21 inventories in hunted areas without salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in British Columbia (31.2 bears/1,000 km2) was as high as or higher than nearby unhunted areas. The case studies had the highest kill densities or among the highest kill rates in the province and hunting targets were commonly exceeded and seasons closed or the hunter kill target reduced. Although population inventories in these areas found moderate or even high densities of bears, some are now in decline. Hunter kill data from declining populations had a high proportion of males and these were older, demonstrating that these indices of kill rates are sometimes unreliable. Although more population density, trend, and vital rate measurements would be beneficial, the hypothesis that the grizzly bear hunt has been unsustainable was not supported by our investigation of available information. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.","Sustainability of the grizzly bear hunt in British Columbia, Canada",Journal of Wildlife Management,10.1002/jwmg.21189

Cunningham,journalofwildlifemanagement,2017,2017,1,Describing the state of nature,0,No response,NA,0,2.055,"The marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is a threatened seabird that forages in nearshore marine waters but nests inland, commonly in older coniferous forests. Information on ranging behavior and breeding propensity can be useful for informing management, especially when comparisons can be made between declining or threatened populations and more stable, unthreatened populations. Over 5 years, we measured ranging behavior and breeding propensity of marbled murrelets in Washington, USA where murrelets are considered threatened. Our primary objective was to compare space use and breeding by murrelets in Washington with those from other regions and where the species is not considered threatened. We radio tracked 157 murrelets from 2004 to 2008. Median marine 95% kernel ranges were 487 km2 (Formula presented.) and larger than those reported for non-threatened populations in Alaska, USA in other studies. Ranges computed from minimum convex polygons (MCPs; median = 404 km2; (Formula presented) were on average similar to those reported for threatened populations in California, USA, although larger than those reported for Alaska. Distances traveled between consecutive marine telemetry locations were greater than reported previously in Alaska. Variation in movements in our study were not associated with oceanographic conditions although appeared greater for murrelets captured along the Pacific Coast compared to those occupying interior marine waters in the Salish Sea. Twenty individuals (12.7%) attempted to breed in our study, and we estimated breeding propensity was 13.120.0%. This is the lowest breeding propensity reported for a population of murrelets to date. For breeders, nest-sea commuting distances were greater than reported previously, with 4 breeders traveling farther than the previously reported maximum of 125 km. The low breeding propensity, large marine ranges, and long nest-sea commutes in this study may point to poor-quality marine habitat in Washington compared to other parts of the murrelet's range. In combination with reported declines in terrestrial nesting habitat from other studies, this indicates that additional management is needed to improve murrelet breeding habitat in Washington. Future management actions should focus on improving both terrestrial and marine habitat. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.",Low breeding propensity and wide-ranging movements by marbled murrelets in Washington,Journal of Wildlife Management,10.1002/jwmg.21192

Gross,journalofwildlifemanagement,2017,2017,2,Threatening mechanism,0,No response,NA,1,2.055,"Understanding the limiting factors of a prey population is important before and during predator control programs, and optimal intensive management of an increasing prey population requires formal recognition of a sustainable population size. The migratory Fortymile caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herd in Alaska reached a low of approximately 6,000 caribou during 19731975. To regain peak numbers of approximately 50,000 caribou estimated in the 1960s, stakeholder groups gained approval for conservative harvest rates (19732013) and periods of restricted nonlethal (19982004) and lethal wolf (Canis lupus) control (20052013). We studied demography of the herd using radio-telemetry during 19902014, when herd size increased from about 22,000 to 52,000 caribou. Parturition rates in the early 1990s were among the highest reported, but parturition rates of primiparous females subsequently declined to a level indicating resource-limitation as caribou numbers approached and then exceeded 50,000. This and companion studies documented several other cautionary signals to an eventual decline, including declining October calf weights, early summer movement off the alpine and subalpine tundra to lower elevation sprucemoss taiga, relatively high caribou densities, a nearly 40-year history of increasing caribou numbers, and a return to previous peak numbers. We studied mortality of calves and older females during the 4 years before wolf control and the first 5 years of nonlethal wolf control. During those 9 years, annual mortality rates averaged 54% for calves and 9% for adult females. We detected no convincing support for decreased wolf predation during nonlethal control. We also detected no support for increased caribou survival during nonlethal or lethal wolf control. Based on counts of caribou during summer aggregations using a total search photocensus technique, rate of herd increase (<U+03BB>r) was negligible (<U+03BB>r = 1.00) during 19901995, highest during the 3 years immediately before nonlethal wolf control (<U+03BB>r = 1.11, 19951998), moderate during nonlethal wolf control (<U+03BB>r = 1.07, 19982003), and low during the period that included the first 5 years of lethal wolf control (<U+03BB>r = 1.02, 20032010). We combined observed cause of death with the 9 annual modeled starting populations (all newborn calves and adults) and estimated that wolves killed 1015% of the populations annually, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) killed 47%, other predators killed 24%, nonpredation factors killed 12%, and hunters killed =2%. Wolves killed 59% of the annual populations as calves and 56% as adults. In retrospect, nonlethal wolf control efforts were too localized to decrease wolf numbers (e.g., adjacent untreated wolf packs reached max. mean numbers). Lethal wolf control efforts had only seasonal and localized effects on wolf numbers. It is important that stakeholders focus on describing a preferred, sustainable herd size, or nutritional status and proceed toward managing this increasing herd in a sustainable manner because, when ungulates overshoot carrying capacity, the effects of high density, adverse weather, and increased predation can have synergistic negative effects on prey numbers and long-lasting negative effects on sustainable yields, contrary to the intended purpose of the wolf control programs. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.",Demography of an increasing caribou herd with restricted wolf control,Journal of Wildlife Management,10.1002/jwmg.21209

Dispersing wolves from Canada naturally recolonized Montana and first denned there in 1986. In 1995 and 1996, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service reintroduced 66 wolves into central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park. By 2008, there were =1,655 wolves in =217 packs, including 95 breeding pairs in the NRM. From 19932008, we captured and radio-collared 1,681 wolves and documented 297 radio-collared wolves dispersing as lone individuals. We monitored dispersing wolves to determine their pack characteristics (i.e., pack size and surrounding pack density) before and after dispersal, their reproductive success, and eventual fate. We calculated summary statistics for characteristics of wolf dispersal (i.e., straight-line distance, age, time of year, sex ratio, reproduction, and survival), and we tested these characteristics for differences between sexes and age groups. Approximately, 10% of the known wolf population dispersed annually. The sex ratio of dispersals favored males (169 M, 128 F), but fewer dispersed males reproduced (28%, n = 47) than females (42%, n = 54). Fifty-nine percent of all dispersers of known age were adults (n = 156), 37% were yearlings (n = 99), and 4% were pups (n = 10). Mean age at dispersal for males (32.8 months) was not significantly different (P = 0.88) than for females (32.1 months). Yellowstone National Park had a significant positive effect on dispersal rate. Pack density in a wolf's natal population had a negative effect on dispersal rate when the entire NRM population was considered. The mean NRM pack size (6.9) from 1993 to 2008 was smaller than the mean size of packs (10.0) from which wolves dispersed during that time period (P < 0.001); however, pack size was not in our most supported model. Dispersals occurred throughout the year but generally increased in the fall and peaked in January. The mean duration of all dispersals was 5.5 months. Radio-collared wolves dispersed between Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming to other adjacent states, and between the United States and Canada throughout the study. Mean straight-line distance between starting and ending points for dispersing males (98.1 km) was not significantly different than females (87.7 km; P = 0.11). Ten wolves (3.4%) dispersed distances >300 km. On average, dispersal distance decreased later in the study (P = 0.006). Sex, survival rate in the natal population, start date, dispersal distance, and direction were not significant predictors of dispersal rate or successful dispersal. Wolves that formed new packs were >11 times more likely to reproduce than those that joined packs and surrounding pack density had a negative effect on successful dispersal. Dispersal behavior seems to be innate in sexually mature wolves and thereby assures that genetic diversity will remain high and help conserve the NRM wolf population. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","Wolf dispersal in the Rocky Mountains, Western United States: 19932008",Journal of Wildlife Management,10.1002/jwmg.21238

These negative interactions might be reduced with more understanding of individual variation in the use of residential areas and if attractants were better predicted by residents and targeted for securement or removal. We fitted 19 urban coyotes with global positioning system (GPS) collars (11 healthy, 8 with sarcoptic mange [Sarcoptes scabiei]) and compared their selection for residential areas at different times of day. We also identified 173 clusters of GPS locations (representing foraging and bedding sites) and paired them with available sites to measure selection for anthropogenic food, shelter, and visual cover. Seventeen of 19 coyotes avoided residential areas in general, but lesser avoidance of residential areas occurred in animals that used these areas during the day. Backyards selected by coyotes were 66.7 times less likely to have fences, 22.2 times more likely to contain anthropogenic food, and had 3.3 times as much visual cover than available yards. Diseased coyotes were 9 times more likely than healthy animals to select for yards with anthropogenic food. Our results suggest that coarse measurements of habitat selection via land cover classes may underestimate the attraction to wildlife of particular features in residential areas. Greater management of these features by municipal governments, residents, and communities might reduce animal use, disease transmission, and human-wildlife conflict for diverse species in urban areas. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.",Predictable features attract urban coyotes to residential yards,Journal of Wildlife Management,10.1002/jwmg.21223

Mahony,journalofwildlifemanagement,2017,2017,2,Threatening mechanism,4,Testing response,NA,0,2.055,"For pond-breeding species, the distribution of larvae is a reflection of habitat suitability and adult breeding site selection. Some species preferentially breed in ephemeral ponds, which can provide benefits for larvae. An alternative strategy used by adults to increase offspring survival is to detect aquatic predators and avoid them when selecting breeding sites. We investigated whether either of these types of breeding site selection are contributing to the negative correlation between the distributions of tadpoles of the threatened green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) and the introduced eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) in Sydney, Australia. From 2003 to 2012 we drained ponds to temporarily remove gambusia and examined the effect of removal on the numbers of male, female, and juvenile frogs, and tadpoles. We found that males preferentially selected fish-free ponds as breeding sites. In addition, the removal of gambusia increased tadpole abundance to over 140 times that of an undrained pond. Pond draining did not influence female or juvenile abundances. The ability to detect and avoid gambusia may be mitigating the effect of predation to a certain extent. We conclude that pond draining to remove exotic fish is an effective strategy that can be used to greatly increase the reproductive success of this and potentially other threatened amphibian species in the presence of exotic predators. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.",Removal of an exotic fish influences amphibian breeding site selection,Journal of Wildlife Management,10.1002/jwmg.21232

From 20122014 we measured body mass of 76 black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) and 268 lesser snow goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) goslings of known age on the Colville River Delta (CRD) of northern Alaska to determine if there was evidence of density-dependent declines in gosling growth following recent population increases of those species and sympatric greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis). We contrasted contemporary body mass of brant goslings and forage biomass in brood-rearing habitats that were shared by all species, with measures obtained on, and near the CRD in the 1990s, prior to the establishment of snow goose nesting colonies in the area. Body mass of brant goslings recaptured between 25 and 32 days of age had not changed over the past 2 decades, despite an influx of snow geese, and increases in populations of brant and white-fronted geese. At 30 days of age, body mass of brant goslings on the CRD was 100400 g heavier than for brant goslings of the same age on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD), Alaska. Contemporary biomass of grazed Carex subspathacea on CRD brood-rearing areas was comparable to the 1990s and was 24 times greater than for the same plant community on the YKD. Historical data on growth of snow goose goslings were not available for the CRD. However, average body mass of 34-day-old snow goose goslings was >230 g heavier than for conspecifics of the same age in the Hudson Bay region. We conclude that the establishment of nesting snow geese on the CRD has not negatively affected brant gosling growth, and that recent population increases of all species have likely not been constrained by forage availability on brood-rearing areas. Barring demographic changes elsewhere in their annual cycles, we predict that goose populations will continue to increase in northern Alaska. However, snow geese are increasing more rapidly than brant in the region. Because the black brant population has periodically been below conservation objectives, the effects of the increasing number of snow geese on forage biomass and growth of brant goslings in northern Alaska should be monitored. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.",Growth of black brant and lesser snow goose goslings in northern alaska,Journal of Wildlife Management,10.1002/jwmg.21246

Our objective was to describe the temporal pattern of train accidents related to wild ungulates (i.e., roe deer [Capreolus capreolus], red deer [Cervus elaphus], moose [Alces alces], and wild boar [Sus scrofa]) to determine when the risk of collision is highest. We gathered data on train collisions with wild ungulates throughout Poland between 2012 and 2015 from Polish Railways Polskie Koleje Panstwowe SA. We used generalized additive mixed models to investigate whether the number of collisions changed over time. The number of wildlife-train collisions varied depending on time of year. Most collisions occurred in autumn when animals form winter herds and migrate to and stay in winter refugia. The fewest collisions occurred in summer during breeding season. For all species except red deer, the number of collisions was significantly lower during weekends compared to weekdays. The distribution of collisions with regard to time of day was significantly different from simulated uniform random distribution, with peaks before dawn and after dusk, which reflect activity peaks of ungulates. During the day, the probability of collision was lower, with only single events observed between 0800 and 1600. We observed another collision-free period after midnight until 0400, probably because train traffic was minimal during this period. Most train collisions with ungulates took place in relatively narrow time windows in terms of time of year and time of day (i.e., 50% of the recorded cases took place in ~17% of the total time observed). Consequently, mitigation measures of lowering speed limits can be applied during times when the risk of collision is highest. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.",Temporal pattern of wildlife-train collisions in Poland,Journal of Wildlife Management,10.1002/jwmg.21311

Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes 5-8, but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition-two processes important in all ecosystems-are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels of species loss (21-40%) reduced plant production by 5-10%, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41-60%) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO2 and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did elevated CO2 and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and remediation efforts9. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",A global synthesis reveals biodiversity loss as a major driver of ecosystem change,Nature,10.1038/nature11118

Historically, low-impact intrusion into species habitats arose from local demands for food, fuel and living space3. However, in today's increasingly globalized economy, international trade chains accelerate habitat degradation far removed from the place of consumption. Although adverse effects of economic prosperity and economic inequality have been confirmed 4,5, the importance of international trade as a driver of threats to species is poorly understood. Here we show that a significant number of species are threatened as a result of international trade along complex routes, and that, in particular, consumers in developed countries cause threats to species through their demand of commodities that are ultimately produced in developing countries. We linked 25,000 Animalia species threat records from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List to more than 15,000 commodities produced in 187 countries and evaluated more than 5 billion supply chains in terms of their biodiversity impacts. Excluding invasive species, we found that 30% of global species threats are due to international trade. In many developed countries, the consumption of imported coffee, tea, sugar, textiles, fish and other manufactured items causes a biodiversity footprint that is larger abroad than at home. Our results emphasize the importance of examining biodiversity loss as a global systemic phenomenon, instead of looking at the degrading or polluting producers in isolation.

With deforestation advancing quickly, protected areas are increasingly becoming final refuges for threatened species and natural ecosystem processes. However, many protected areas in the tropics are themselves vulnerable to human encroachment and other environmental stresses. As pressures mount, it is vital to know whether existing reserves can sustain their biodiversity. A critical constraint in addressing this question has been that data describing a broad array of biodiversity groups have been unavailable for a sufficiently large and representative sample of reserves. Here we present a uniquely comprehensive data set on changes over the past 20 to 30 years in 31 functional groups of species and 21 potential drivers of environmental change, for 60 protected areas stratified across the worlds major tropical regions. Our analysis reveals great variation in reserve health: about half of all reserves have been effective or performed passably, but the rest are experiencing an erosion of biodiversity that is often alarmingly widespread taxonomically and functionally. Habitat disruption, hunting and forest-product exploitation were the strongest predictors of declining reserve health. Crucially, environmental changes immediately outside reserves seemed nearly as important as those inside in determining their ecological fate, with changes inside reserves strongly mirroring those occurring around them. These findings suggest that tropical protected areas are often intimately linked ecologically to their surrounding habitats, and that a failure to stem broad-scale loss and degradation of such habitats could sharply increase the likelihood of serious biodiversity declines. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Fleeger and Sergio Fagherazzi and Wilfred M. Wollheim,nature,2012,2012,2,Threatening mechanism,0,No response,NA,232,38.597,"Salt marshes are highly productive coastal wetlands that provide important ecosystem services such as storm protection for coastal cities, nutrient removal and carbon sequestration. Despite protective measures, however, worldwide losses of these ecosystems have accelerated in recent decades. Here we present data from a nine-year whole-ecosystem nutrient-enrichment experiment. Our study demonstrates that nutrient enrichment, a global problem for coastal ecosystems, can be a driver of salt marsh loss. We show that nutrient levels commonly associated with coastal eutrophication increased above-ground leaf biomass, decreased the dense, below-ground biomass of bank-stabilizing roots, and increased microbial decomposition of organic matter. Alterations in these key ecosystem properties reduced geomorphic stability, resulting in creek-bank collapse with significant areas of creek-bank marsh converted to unvegetated mud. This pattern of marsh loss parallels observations for anthropogenically nutrient-enriched marshes worldwide, with creek-edge and bay-edge marsh evolving into mudflats and wider creeks. Our work suggests that current nutrient loading rates to many coastal ecosystems have overwhelmed the capacity of marshes to remove nitrogen without deleterious effects. Projected increases in nitrogen flux to the coast, related to increased fertilizer use required to feed an expanding human population, may rapidly result in a coastal landscape with less marsh, which would reduce the capacity of coastal regions to provide important ecological and economic services. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

1377,general,Combined pesticide exposure severely affects individual- and   colony-level traits in bees,Richard J. Gill and Oscar Ramos-Rodriguez and Nigel E. Raine,nature,2012,2012,2,Threatening mechanism,0,No response,NA,276,38.597,"Reported widespread declines of wild and managed insect pollinators have serious consequences for global ecosystem services and agricultural production. Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations. Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour and reductions in colony queen production. However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level, it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging, yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated. Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity. Moreover, we provide evidence that combinatorial exposure to pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

One primary cause of productivity loss and plant mortality during drought is hydraulic failure. Drought stress creates trapped gas emboli in the water transport system, which reduces the ability of plants to supply water to leaves for photosynthetic gas exchange and can ultimately result in desiccation and mortality. At present we lack a clear picture of how thresholds to hydraulic failure vary across a broad range of species and environments, despite many individual experiments. Here we draw together published and unpublished data on the vulnerability of the transport system to drought-induced embolism for a large number of woody species, with a view to examining the likely consequences of climate change for forest biomes. We show that 70% of 226 forest species from 81 sites worldwide operate with narrow (<1a megapascal) hydraulic safety margins against injurious levels of drought stress and therefore potentially face long-term reductions in productivity and survival if temperature and aridity increase as predicted for many regions across the globe. Safety margins are largely independent of mean annual precipitation, showing that there is global convergence in the vulnerability of forests to drought, with all forest biomes equally vulnerable to hydraulic failure regardless of their current rainfall environment. These findings provide insight into why drought-induced forest decline is occurring not only in arid regions but also in wet forests not normally considered at drought risk. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Vegetation restoration is a common tool used to mitigate these impacts and increasingly aims to restore ecosystem functions rather than species diversity. However, evidence from community experiments on the effect of restoration practices on ecosystem functions is scarce. Pollination is an important ecosystem function and the global decline in pollinators attenuates the resistance of natural areas and agro-environments to disturbances. Thus, the ability of pollination functions to resist or recover from disturbance (that is, the functional resilience) may be critical for ensuring a successful restoration process. Here we report the use of a community field experiment to investigate the effects of vegetation restoration, specifically the removal of exotic shrubs, on pollination. We analyse 64 plant-pollinator networks and the reproductive performance of the ten most abundant plant species across four restored and four unrestored, disturbed mountaintop communities. Ecosystem restoration resulted in a marked increase in pollinator species, visits to flowers and interaction diversity. Interactions in restored networks were more generalized than in unrestored networks, indicating a higher functional redundancy in restored communities. Shifts in interaction patterns had direct and positive effects on pollination, especially on the relative and total fruit production of native plants. Pollinator limitation was prevalent at unrestored sites only, where the proportion of flowers producing fruit increased with pollinator visitation, approaching the higher levels seen in restored plant communities. Our results show that vegetation restoration can improve pollination, suggesting that the degradation of ecosystem functions is at least partially reversible. The degree of recovery may depend on the state of degradation before restoration intervention and the proximity to pollinator source populations in the surrounding landscape. We demonstrate that network structure is a suitable indicator for pollination quality, highlighting the usefulness of interaction networks in environmental management.",Ecosystem restoration strengthens pollination network resilience and function,Nature,10.1038/nature21071

While new international policy and assessment processes such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) recognize the importance of an increasingly global, quantitative and comprehensive approach to biodiversity protection, most insights are still focused on a single facet of biodiversity - species. Here we broaden the focus and provide an evaluation of how much of the world's species, functional and phylogenetic diversity of birds and mammals is currently protected and the scope for improvement. We show that the large existing gaps in the coverage for each facet of diversity could be remedied by a slight expansion of protected areas: an additional 5% of the land has the potential to more than triple the protected range of species or phylogenetic or functional units. Further, the same areas are often priorities for multiple diversity facets and for both taxa. However, we find that the choice of conservation strategy has a fundamental effect on outcomes. It is more difficult (that is, requires more land) to maximize basic representation of the global biodiversity pool than to maximize local diversity. Overall, species and phylogenetic priorities are more similar to each other than they are to functional priorities, and priorities for the different bird biodiversity facets are more similar than those of mammals. Our work shows that large gains in biodiversity protection are possible, while also highlighting the need to explicitly link desired conservation objectives and biodiversity metrics.

Recovery time - how long an ecosystem requires to revert to its pre-drought functional state - is a critical metric of drought impact. Yet the factors influencing drought recovery and its spatiotemporal patterns at the global scale are largely unknown. Here we analyse three independent datasets of gross primary productivity and show that, across diverse ecosystems, drought recovery times are strongly associated with climate and carbon cycle dynamics, with biodiversity and CO 2 fertilization as secondary factors. Our analysis also provides two key insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of drought recovery time: first, that recovery is longest in the tropics and high northern latitudes (both vulnerable areas of Earth's climate system) and second, that drought impacts (assessed using the area of ecosystems actively recovering and time to recovery) have increased over the twentieth century.

Anthropogenic drivers linked to this decline include habitat changes, intensive agriculture, pesticides, invasive alien species, spread of pathogens and climate change. Recently, the rapid global increase in artificial light at night has been proposed to be a new threat to terrestrial ecosystems; the consequences of this increase for ecosystem function are mostly unknown. Here we show that artificial light at night disrupts nocturnal pollination networks and has negative consequences for plant reproductive success. In artificially illuminated plant-pollinator communities, nocturnal visits to plants were reduced by 62% compared to dark areas. Notably, this resulted in an overall 13% reduction in fruit set of a focal plant even though the plant also received numerous visits by diurnal pollinators. Furthermore, by merging diurnal and nocturnal pollination sub-networks, we show that the structure of these combined networks tends to facilitate the spread of the negative consequences of disrupted nocturnal pollination to daytime pollinator communities. Our findings demonstrate that artificial light at night is a threat to pollination and that the negative effects of artificial light at night on nocturnal pollination are predicted to propagate to the diurnal community, thereby aggravating the decline of the diurnal community. We provide perspectives on the functioning of plant-pollinator communities, showing that nocturnal pollinators are not redundant to diurnal communities and increasing our understanding of the human-induced decline in pollinators and their ecosystem service.",Artificial light at night as a new threat to pollination,Nature,10.1038/nature23288

A ranch formerly dedicated to sheep production was converted into a private wildlife reserve, from which all the sheep were removed in 2005. We studied changes in guanaco abundance inside and outside the reserve after sheep removal, and also plant cover of various vegetation types. We found that guanaco abundance was higher inside than outside the reserve, and increased by three-fold within 3 years. Total plant cover and grass cover were higher inside than outside the reserve. Our results showed that guanacos reacted rapidly to changes in management, and suggest that even at a high density guanacos would not be as damaging to the vegetation as sheep.

Although the species occurs in the Valdivian Ecoregion, a hotspot for biodiversity, we have no information on its occupancy and potential distribution in this region. We built and compared species distribution models for huemul using the maximum entropy approach, using 258 presence records and sets of bioclimatic and geographical variables as predictors, with the objective of assessing the potential distribution of the species in the Valdivian Ecoregion. Annual temperature range and summer precipitation were the predictive variables with the greatest influence in the best-fitting model. Approximately 12,360 km2 of the study area was identified as suitable habitat for the huemul, of which 30% is included in the national protected area systems of Chile and Argentina.

Financial incentives are increasingly used with the goal of increasing people's tolerance of predators, but the definition of tolerance has been vague and inconsistent. Empirical correlations between attitudinal and behavioural measures of tolerance imply that attitudes may be a valid proxy for behaviours. However, theoretical differences between the concepts suggest that attitudinal tolerance and behavioural intention to kill cats would have different underlying determinants. We surveyed 112 residents within a forest-farm mosaic in northern Belize inhabited by jaguars Panthera onca and four other species of wild cats. A conservation payment programme pays local landowners when camera traps record cat presence on their land. Results indicated that tolerance was associated with gender and participation in the camera-Trapping programme, whereas intention to kill cats was associated with cultural group (Mennonites vs Mestizos), presence of children in the home and, to a lesser extent, tolerance. Neither dependent variable was significantly related to depredation losses or economic factors. Results suggest that monetary payments alone are unlikely to affect attitudes and behaviours towards carnivores. Payment programmes may be enhanced by accentuating non-monetary incentives, leveraging social norms and targeting specific groups with information about risks and benefits associated with carnivores. By empirically separating two concepts commonly conflated as 'tolerance' we clarify understanding of how social forces interact with financial incentives to shape people's relationships with predators.",Conservation payments in a social context: Determinants of tolerance and behavioural intentions towards wild cats in northern Belize,ORYX,10.1017/S0030605316000545

Expression of these changes in tropical marine ecosystems is poorly understood because of sparse observational datasets. We link contemporary ecological changes in the southern Caribbean Sea to global climate change indices. Monthly observations from the CARIACO Ocean Time-Series between 1996 and 2010 document significant decadal scale trends, including a net sea surface temperature (SST) rise of ~1.0 ± 0.14°C (±SE), intensified stratification, reduced delivery of upwelled nutrients to surface waters, and diminished phytoplankton bloom intensities evident as overall declines in chlorophyll a concentrations (<U+0394>Chla = -2.8 ± 0.5%·y-1) and net primary production (<U+0394>NPP = -1.5 ± 0.3%·y-1). Additionally, phytoplankton taxon dominance shifted from diatoms, dinoflagellates, and coccolithophorids to smaller taxa after 2004, whereas mesozooplankton biomass increased and commercial landings of planktivorous sardines collapsed. Collectively, our results reveal an ecological state change in this planktonic system. The weakening trend in Trade Winds (-1.9 ± 0.3%·y-1) and dependent local variables are largely explained by trends in two climatic indices, namely the northward migration of the Azores High pressure center (descending branch of Hadley cell) by 1.12 ± 0.42°N latitude and the northeasterly progression of the ITCZ Atlantic centroid (ascending branch of Hadley cell), the March position of which shifted by about 800 km between 1996 and 2009.",Ecosystem responses in the southern Caribbean Sea to global climate change,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.1207514109

They are similarly thought to be among the most significant conservation threats to Antarctica, especially as climate change proceeds in the region. However, no comprehensive, continent-wide evaluation of the risks to Antarctica posed by such species has been undertaken. Here we do so by sampling, identifying, and mapping the vascular plant propagules carried by all categories of visitors to Antarctica during the International Polar Year's first season (2007-2008) and assessing propagule establishment likelihood based on their identity and origins and on spatial variation in Antarctica's climate. For an evaluation of the situation in 2100, we use modeled climates based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report on Emissions Scenarios Scenario A1B [Nakicénovic N, Swart R, eds (2000) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios: A Special Report of Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK)]. Visitors carrying seeds average 9.5 seeds per person, although as vectors, scientists carry greater propagule loads than tourists. Annual tourist numbers (~33,054) are higher than those of scientists (~7,085), thus tempering these differences in propagule load. Alien species establishment is currently most likely for the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Recent founder populations of several alien species in this area corroborate these findings. With climate change, risks will grow in the Antarctic Peninsula, Ross Sea, and East Antarctic coastal regions. Our evidence-based assessment demonstrates which parts of Antarctica are at growing risk from alien species that may become invasive and provides the means to mitigate this threat now and into the future as the continent's climate changes.",Continent-wide risk assessment for the establishment of nonindigenous species in Antarctica,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.1119787109

We used the InVEST software tool to evaluate the environmental and financial implications of seven planning scenarios encompassing contrasting land-use combinations including biofuel feedstocks, food crops, forestry, livestock, and residential development. All scenarios had positive financial return relative to the status quo of negative return. However, tradeoffs existed between carbon storage and water quality as well as between environmental improvement and financial return. Based on this analysis and community input, Kamehameha Schools is implementing a plan to support diversified agriculture and forestry. This plan generates a positive financial return ($10.9 million) and improved carbon storage (0.5% increase relative to status quo) with negative relative effects on water quality (15.4% increase in potential nitrogen export relative to status quo). The effects on water quality could be mitigated partially (reduced to a 4.9% increase in potential nitrogen export) by establishing vegetation buffers on agricultural fields.

Prior studies indicate similarities in the geographic arrangement of biological and linguistic diversity, although conclusions have often been constrained by use of data with limited spatial precision. Here we use greatly improved datasets to explore the co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity in regions containingmany of the Earth's remaining species: biodiversity hotspots and high biodiversity wilderness areas. Results indicate that these regions often contain considerable linguistic diversity, accounting for 70% of all languages on Earth. Moreover, the languages involved are frequently unique (endemic) to particular regions, with many facing extinction. Likely reasons for co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity are complex and appear to vary among localities, although strong geographic concordance between biological and linguistic diversity in many areas argues for some form of functional connection. Languages in high biodiversity regions also often co-occur with one or more specific conservation priorities, here defined as endangered species and protected areas, marking particular localities important for maintaining both forms of diversity.

In some places, up to 39% of mammals may be unable to track shifts in suitable climates. Eighty-seven percent of mammalian species are expected to experience reductions in range size and 20% of these range reductions will likely be due to limited dispersal abilities as opposed to reductions in the area of suitable climate.

Here we develop spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land-cover change and explore the direct impacts on biodiversity hotspots and tropical carbon biomass. If current trends in population density continue and all areas with high probabilities of urban expansion undergo change, then by 2030, urban land cover will increase by 1.2 million km 2, nearly tripling the global urban land area circa 2000. This increase would result in considerable loss of habitats in key biodiversity hotspots, with the highest rates of forecasted urban growth to take place in regions that were relatively undisturbed by urban development in 2000: the Eastern Afromontane, the Guinean Forests of West Africa, and the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka hotspots. Within the pan-tropics, loss in vegetation biomass from areas with high probability of urban expansion is estimated to be 1.38 PgC (0.05 PgC yr-1), equal to ~5% of emissions from tropical deforestation and land-use change.

Innovative recent studies evaluating the factors associated with success and failure typically examine only a single resource domain, have limited geographic scope, consider only one outcome, or ignore the nested nature of socioecological systems. To remedy these issues, we use a global comparative database of CBC projects identified by systematic review to evaluate success in four outcome domains (attitudes, behaviors, ecological, economic) and explore synergies and trade-offs among these outcomes. We test hypotheses about how features of the national context, project design, and local community characteristics affect these measures of success. Using bivariate analyses and multivariate proportional odds logistic regressions within a multilevel analysis and model-fitting framework, we show that project design, particularly capacity-building in local communities, is associated with success across all outcomes. In addition, some characteristics of the local community in which projects are conducted, such as tenure regimes and supportive cultural beliefs and institutions, are important for project success. Surprisingly, there is little evidence that national context systematically influences project outcomes.We also find evidence of synergies between pairs of outcomes, particularly between ecological and economic success.

Using a newly assembled and taxonomically expansive database, we analyzed the relationships between extinction risk and body mass (27,647 species) and between extinction risk and range size (21,294 species) for vertebrates across six main classes. We found that the probability of being threatened was positively and significantly related to body mass for birds, cartilaginous fishes, and mammals. Bimodal relationships were evident for amphibians, reptiles, and bony fishes. Most importantly, a bimodal relationship was found across all vertebrates such that extinction risk changes around a body mass breakpoint of 0.035 kg, indicating that the lightest and heaviest vertebrates have elevated extinction risk. We also found range size to be an important predictor of the probability of being threatened, with strong negative relationships across nearly all taxa. A review of the drivers of extinction risk revealed that the heaviest vertebrates are most threatened by direct killing by humans. By contrast, the lightest vertebrates are most threatened by habitat loss and modification stemming especially from pollution, agricultural cropping, and logging. Our results offer insight into halting the ongoing wave of vertebrate extinctions by revealing the vulnerability of large and small taxa, and identifying size-specific threats.

Here, we use spatial conservation planning to (i) identify and compare priority regions for global mammal conservation across three key dimensions of biodiversity - taxonomic, phylogenetic, and traits - and (ii) determine the overlap of these regions with the locations of threatened species and existing protected areas. We show that priority areas for mammal conservation exhibit low overlap across the three dimensions, highlighting the need for an integrative approach for biodiversity conservation. Additionally, currently protected areas poorly represent the three dimensions of mammalian biodiversity. We identify areas of high conservation priority among and across the dimensions that should receive special attention for expanding the global protected area network. These high-priority areas, combined with areas of high priority for other taxonomic groups and with social, economic, and political considerations, provide a biological foundation for future conservation planning efforts.",Global priorities for conservation across multiple dimensions of mammalian diversity,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.1706461114

We identified less common conservation strategies that have more support but that are unproven in practice and may be more expensive.

Alarmingly, it is expected to exacerbate under climate change due to shifting precipitation patterns and rising air temperature. However, the impact of concomitant changes in atmospheric humidity and CO2 concentration through their influence on stomatal kinetics remains a subject of debate and inquiry. By using a dynamic soilplantatmosphere model, mortality risks associated with hydraulic failure and stomatal closure for 13 temperate and tropical forest biomes across the globe are analyzed. The mortality risk is evaluated in response to both individual and combined changes in precipitation amounts and their seasonal distribution, mean air temperature, specific humidity, and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Model results show that the risk is predicted to significantly increase due to changes in precipitation and air temperature regime for the period 20502069. However, this increase may largely get alleviated by concurrent increases in atmospheric specific humidity and CO2 concentration. The increase in mortality risk is expected to be higher for needleleaf forests than for broadleaf forests, as a result of disparity in hydraulic traits.
