Title = {CAVE-DWELLING ARTHROPODS AND VERTEBRATES OF NORTH RIM GRAND CANYON, WITH
   NOTES ON ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Prior to this study, there was no information on arthropods, bats, and
   other vertebrates of caves in north-westernmost Arizona. Based on
   invertebrate and vertebrate inventory work conducted during 2005 and
   2006, we provide future directions for conservation and management for
   caves on Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, northwestern Arizona.
   Baseline investigations to find and identify arthropods, bats, and other
   vertebrates were conducted at 7 of the largest known caves on the
   monument. We identified 52 morphospecies including 44 arthropods, 4
   bats, and 4 other vertebrates. Of the cave-dwelling arthropods, we found
   10 eisodophiles, 6 troglophiles, 8 questionable troglophiles, 7
   trogloxenes, 8 accidentals, 3 taxa of unknown cave affiliations, and 2
   mammalian parasites. We made several contributions to the entomological
   record including 2 new genera, 6 new species, 3 possible new species,
   one range extension, and one possible range extension. Also, we
   identified 5 bat roosts-1 hibernaculum, 2 night roosts, and 3 summer
   roosts of unconfirmed use. Observed arthropod richness per cave ranged
   from 1 to 14 morphospecies, and observed bat and other vertebrate
   (combined) richness was 1-3 morphospecies. We did not detect any
   cave-adapted arthropods during this investigation. For the caves
   sampled, we are uncertain whether the lack of cave-adapted taxa is due
   to (a) low nutrient input and high cryptoaridity associated with many
   southwestern cave systems or (b) lack of intensive sampling. Despite the
   lack of cave-adapted species, 5 of the 7 caves inventoried are
   considered of high management concern. Additional research at these
   caves will be required to obtain the data necessary to best manage and
   protect these systems.},

Title = {Validating Star-Oddi heart rate and acceleration data storage tags for
   use in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {Background: Data storage tags (DSTs) record and store information about
   animals and their environment, and can provide important data relevant
   to fish culture, ecology and conservation. A DST has recently been
   developed that records heart rate (f H ), electrocardiograms (ECGs),
   tri-axial acceleration and temperature. However, at the time of this
   study, no research using these tags had been performed on fish or
   determined the quality of the data collected. Thus, our research asked:
   do these DSTs provide reliable and meaningful data? To examine this
   question, Atlantic salmon (1.4 +/- 0.7 kg) were implanted with DSTs,
   then swam at increasing speeds in a swim tunnel after 1 week of
   recovery. Further, in two separate experiments, salmon (2.4 +/- 0.1 kg)
   were implanted with DSTs and held in a large tank with conspecifics for
   1 week at 11 degrees C or 6 weeks at 8-12 degrees C.
   Results: External acceleration (EA) and variation in EA (VAR) increased
   exponentially with swimming speed and tail beat frequency. The quality
   index (QI) assigned to ECG recordings (where QI(0) means very good
   quality, and QI(1) QI(2) and QI(3) are of reduced quality) did not
   change significantly with increasing swimming speed (QI(0)similar to
   60-80\%). However, we found that the accuracy of the tag algorithm in
   estimating f(H) from ECGs was reduced when QI(>0). Diurnal patterns of
   f(H) and EA were evident from the time the salmon were placed in the
   tank. Heart rate appeared to stabilize by similar to 4 days post-surgery
   in the first experiment, but extended holding showed that f(H) declined
   for 2-3 weeks. During extended holding, the tag had difficulty recording
   low f(H) values <30 bpm, and for this reason, in addition to the fact
   that the algorithm can miscalculate f(H) , it is highly recommended that
   ECGs be saved when possible for quality control and so that f(H) values
   with QI|(>)(0) can be manually calculated.
   Conclusions: With these DSTs, parameters of acceleration can be used to
   monitor the activity of free-swimming salmon. Further, changes in f(H)
   and heart rate variability (HRV) due to diurnal rhythms, and in response
   to temperature, activity and stressors, can be recorded.},

Title = {Relationships between multiple biological groups and classification

Abstract = {The correspondence between physical classification schemes and the
   structure of biological assemblages has been intensively investigated in
   recent years for the implementation of bioassessment, biomonitoring and
   conservation programs. We evaluated the effect of temporal variability
   on the classification strengths of geographically and limnologically
   delimited regions and of lake connectivity for biological assemblages in
   a Neotropical floodplain. We sampled several biological groups from
   lakes in the Upper Parana River floodplain over two years. Two
   classification criteria were used, considering (i) lakes associated with
   three sub-systems (regional scale classification) and (ii) lakes with
   and without watercourse connections to the river main channel (local
   scale classification). We directly evaluated the effects of sampling
   period, sub-systems and connectivity using Permutational Multivariate
   Analysis of Variance. For the significant factors, we calculated the
   extent to which the mean within-class similarity exceeded the mean
   between-class similarity (a measure of classification strength).
   Finally, we generated classes based on the biological data to evaluate
   whether they overlapped with the classifications we proposed. The
   correspondence between the classification criteria and the structures of
   the assemblages depended on the taxonomic group analyzed. A regional
   scale classification scheme based on sub-systems was important in
   accounting for the variability in the structures of different biological
   assemblages. Connectivity was important only in differentiating
   macrophyte and zooplankton assemblages. However, temporal variability is
   an important component affecting the responses of biological assemblages
   to physical divisions at different spatial scales. In addition,
   strengths of classifications were generally weak. The a posteriori
   classifications presented higher strengths of classifications, but also
   indicated that sub-systems, connectivity and sampling periods are
   important factors contributing to the variability of different
   biological assemblages. Further investigations in Neotropical
   floodplains should also take into account other local factors (e.g.,
   aquatic macrophyte cover) to increase the predictive power of
   regionalization schemes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Kruger National Park research supersites: Establishing long-term
   research sites for cross-disciplinary, multiscaled learning},
Journal = {KOEDOE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Researchers interested in studying the effects of fire or herbivory in
   the Kruger National Park (KNP) often focus their research activities on
   the experimental burn plots or herbivore exclosure camps, respectively.
   These are manipulated sites that apply treatments, for example annual
   fires or total exclusion of fire and herbivores. However, many projects
   aim to study or monitor patterns and processes emerging under
   non-manipulated conditions, typically at sites with contrasting
   geologies and rainfall. Yet, these sites are usually selected in a
   haphazard and uncoordinated manner for different projects and, as a
   consequence, it is often not possible to integrate datasets and
   knowledge. An alternative to the ever-increasing number of unrelated
   sites scattered across the park are the `KNP research supersites' which
   have been earmarked to geographically focus future research effort,
   acting as data-rich, long-term sites for monitoring and research. In
   this paper, we introduced the four recently established KNP research
   supersites, which cover the rainfall gradient and geological contrast of
   the KNP, presenting their rationale, selection criteria and location,
   along with existing datasets that describe their herbaceous biomass,
   woody cover, phenology, fire history, levels of herbivory. Additional
   site-specific datasets, which are already available, or which are in
   preparation, were outlined together with details for assessing these
   open-source datasets online.
   Conservation implications: The KNP research supersites will become
   increasingly used for research, monitoring and remote-sensing
   calibration and ground-truthing purposes. Scientists are encouraged to
   gain from, and contribute towards, these sites, which will facilitate
   long-term data collection, data-sharing and co-learning and, ultimately,
   lead to a more integrated, multiscaled and multitemporal understanding
   of savannahs.},

Abstract = {Global climate change induces species range shifts and population
   expansion to higher latitudes in response to rising temperatures. One
   consequence of climate-induced range shifts is an increased sympatry
   between related but previously isolated species, potentially resulting
   in interspecific interactions and hybridization. The Arctic is more
   rapidly affected by climate warming than any region on Earth and
   resident species may be prone to interspecific hybridization due to the
   immigration of new colonizing species. The red fox Vulpes vulpes
   expanded its range into the Arctic during the twentieth century and is
   now in sympatry with the native Arctic fox Vulpes lagopus in many
   places. In this context, an Arctic-like fox displaying an unusual
   reddish winter coat was observed in 2013 in Nunavut, Canada, a phenotype
   unknown by Inuit people to date. In this study, we assessed the
   biological origin of this specimen with a multigenic approach using
   markers located on mitochondrial DNA, sex (X and Y) chromosomes, and
   autosomes (microsatellites and the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene;
   a gene involved in the color polymorphism in canids). Our comparative
   analyses with genetic material from Arctic and red foxes displaying
   ``classic{''} phenotypes (N = 14 and 16, respectively) suggested a pure
   Arctic fox origin of the specimen. Specifically, this fox yielded mtDNA,
   X-linked, Y-linked, and MC1R alleles specific to Arctic fox. Bayesian
   genetic assignment based on 16 microsatellite loci assigned it to Arctic
   fox with high confidence (q = 99.7\%). Thus, a recent hybrid origin for
   this specimen is excluded. This alternative winter coat color
   polymorphism in Arctic fox requires further analyses to determine its
   underlying genetic mechanism.},

Abstract = {We collected data from 1998 to 2014 to describe the ecology of the
   highly endangered Florida scrub plant Crotalaria avonensis (Avon Park
   Harebells), and herein address several hypotheses based on what was
   known of its biology and the biology of co-occurring species. This
   perennial herbaceous legume occurs at 3 sites and prefers microsites
   with more cover by bare sand than vegetation. The population at an
   unprotected site has declined in size, but dynamics have been more
   stable at the 2 protected sites. Marked plants have shown high survival,
   slow and inconsistent growth, and occasional plant dormancy (usually 1-2
   years). Avon Park Harebells is reproductively challenged, with very low
   rates of fruit set and infrequent visitation by required pollinators.
   The hardseeded fruits germinated at a rate of 13-56\%; the germination
   speed seemed to increase after scarification, though the overall rate
   was less than for unscarified seeds. Unscarified seeds remained viable
   in the seed bank for at least 3 years. Seedlings recruited rarely, had
   moderate survival, began flowering at 4 years of age or later, and
   reached the size of median adult plants in 6-8 years. Herbivores
   affected 7-53\% of plants in a given year, but plants showed rapid
   compensatory resprouting. Caging plants reduced herbivory and increased
   survival, growth, and flowering. Plants resprouted after fire and
   mechanical disturbance and exhibited high survival and growth, but
   repeated disturbances by vehicles caused increased mortality. Avon Park
   Harebells remains extremely endangered due to its limited range, small
   population sizes, and poor seedling recruitment. To help this species
   recover, we recommend fire management, protection from herbivory,
   introductions and augmentations, and further study of its pollination
   biology.},

Title = {Responses of grassland arthropods to an invasion by nonnative grasses},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {405-416},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In grassland ecosystems, invasions by nonnative grasses typically
   decrease floristic diversity and structural heterogeneity in ways that
   alter the quantity and quality of habitat for animals. Grassland
   arthropods that rely directly on herbaceous plants for food, shelter, or
   as substrates for reproduction are especially vulnerable to these
   invasions because many have evolved specialized relationships with host
   plants that might be displaced. We evaluated how invasions by nonnative
   grasses affected abundance and richness of foliage-dwelling arthropods
   in semidesert grasslands of Arizona, USA. On 90, 3.1-ha plots
   established along a gradient of invasion where dominance of nonnative
   grasses ranged from 0 to nearly 100\% of grass cover, we captured
   >90,000 arthropods from 11 orders during 270 surveys in 2014 and 2015.
   Although the invasion by nonnative grasses (primarily Eragrostis
   lehmanniana and secondarily E. curvula) increased the amount of
   herbaceous foliage available to arthropods, richness of arthropods
   decreased by an average of 2\% and total abundance by an average of 7\%
   for every 10\% increase in nonnative-grass dominance. Responses to the
   plant invasion, however, varied among taxa and functional groups. As
   dominance of nonnative grasses increased, abundances of most predators
   and specialist herbivores decreased, whereas abundances of most
   generalist herbivores were lowest at intermediate points of the invasion
   gradient. The changes we observed in the arthropod community have
   potential to alter broad-scale ecological processes, including energy
   flow and nutrient cycling, and to reduce food resources for
   insectivores, which can have adverse, cascading effects on imperiled
   grassland ecosystems.},

Title = {The impact of lions on the demography and ecology of endangered African
   wild dogs},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},

Pages = {382-390},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {It has long been recognized that superior carnivores can impact on the
   demography and ecology of smaller members of the guild, although exact
   mechanisms remain unclear. Here we use original data from a unique
   natural experiment to study some of the mechanisms by which African
   lions Panthera leo impact on African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. Using a
   study site where wild dogs outnumbered lions for several years prior to
   lion population recovery, we aimed to investigate whether or not, and by
   which means, wild dog populations are regulated and influenced by lions.
   We used 38 pack-years of demographic and behavioural data across two
   4-year periods where lion density differed 20-fold (pre-lion era:
   1996-1999 and lion era: 2010-2013) to assess how lions may affect wild
   dog pack size and age structure, litter size and pup survival (n = 329
   pups), as well as den site selection (n = 46 dens). Pack size was
   significantly greater during the pre-lion era. The pup to adult ratio
   was lower during the lion era and the change in pack composition was
   directly attributable to significantly greater lion-induced pup
   mortality. We also demonstrate a behavioural shift, with locations
   selected for the vulnerable denning period being in more rugged terrain
   and in areas with lower prey densities during the lion era, as compared
   with the pre-lion era. Lower adult recruitment into a population of an
   obligate cooperative breeder like the African wild dog can have complex
   consequences, including on feeding and defence of young, and mate
   finding.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {387-392},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ecological niche indicators have been scarcely adopted to assess the
   biological control of insect herbivores by their natural enemies. We
   hypothesize that plant diversification promotes the biocontrol services
   by narrowing the niches of herbivores and broadening the niches of
   natural enemies. In a large-scale experiment, we found that the
   abundance of natural enemies was increased by 38.1\%, and the abundance
   of insect herbivores was decreased by 16.9\% in peach orchards with
   plant diversification (treatment) compared to ones with monoculture
   (control). Stratified sampling indicated that the horizontal, vertical,
   temporal and three-dimensional niches of natural enemies were generally
   broader while these niches of herbivores were narrower. Additionally,
   diverse plants give rise to an increase in the temporal synchrony and
   spatial similarity of the herbivores and natural enemies in peach
   orchards. Our study reveals that plant diversification promotes the
   biocontrol services by shaping the niche of herbivores and natural
   enemies, and provides a new assessment method to understand the
   biodiversity-niche-ecosystem management interactions.},

Title = {Biased baselines? Differences in manual and computer-based modelling of
   blue-winged teal (Spatula discors) habitat suitability},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {61},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Assessing wildlife habitat suitability has been an important tool in
   species conservation for generations of wildlife managers, despite
   changes in technology and theoretical frameworks. The goal of this study
   was to quantify differences in habitat suitability indices (HSIs) for
   blue-winged teal derived from our re-creation of traditional paper-based
   outputs and GIS-based outputs using the same inputs and to determine how
   HSIs for bluewinged teal would respond to fine-scale applications in
   Miquelon Lake Provincial Park, Canada. The subsequent models assessed
   the four original variables presented by the 1985 USFWS model: wetland
   density, wetland area, horizontal cover, and proximity to wetlands for
   three components of breeding habitat including pair bonding, nesting,
   and brood rearing. For a subset of GIS models, vertical cover was also
   incorporated into our analyses to determine its applicability in the
   model's assessment of aerial predation risk for blue-winged teal. The
   paperbased model consistently produced higher habitat suitability scores
   when compared to the GIS model, with only the brood-rearing model being
   slightly lower. When vertical cover was included in the GIS model either
   by itself or combined with horizontal cover, the area of high
   suitability habitat was reduced to 0\% and similar to 3\%, respectively.
   Results revealed that the species did not show a special preference to
   high or moderately suitable habitats. Given the overestimation of
   habitat suitability at all breeding stages for blue-winged teal, the
   comparative utility of the actual HSI scores derived manually from such
   models are limited; however, the longterm ecological insights into model
   inputs are invaluable when integrated with emerging spatial data for
   computer-based habitat modelling.},

Abstract = {The Wenchuan earthquake of May 2008 was a severe natural disaster that
   caused significant damage to the habitat of the endangered giant panda
   (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) inhabiting southwestern China. However, the
   effect of the earthquake on giant pandas is understudied. We took
   advantage of our long-term dataset on panda habitat use in the Minshan
   Mountains to investigate panda response to this disaster. We analyzed
   the habitat use patterns of giant pandas over the course of a 6-year
   period (5 years pre-earth-quake and 1 year post-earthquake) along
   fixed-width line transects. We found that the habitat use patterns of
   giant pandas were stable before the earthquake and there was no obvious
   change after the earthquake (despite habitat loss that occurred). We
   argue that the Wenchuan earthquake does not appear to have been a
   significant threat for the giant panda. Our findings contribute to
   ongoing habitat restoration plans and long-term conservation of the
   giant panda. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Human-mediated mortality constitutes a major threat to species
   persistence, particularly for widespread carnivores that undergo harvest
   and population control, such as the leopard (Panthera pardus). In this
   study, we evaluated the extent and spatial distribution of legal
   anthropogenic offtake of leopards to identify de facto refugia and
   ecological traps across Limpopo Province, South Africa. We defined
   refugia as management units with offtake levels below an established
   sustainable harvest rate, and ecological traps as management units with
   offtake exceeding the sustainable harvest rate. We assessed offtake at
   three geographical scales using trophy hunting permit records alone, and
   then in combination with problem leopard permit records to investigate
   the compounding effect of additional forms of offtake and the potential
   for management scale mismatching. Across Limpopo Province, high leopard
   offtake created fewer areas of refuge than ecological traps. Refugia
   were smaller in size and within close proximity of ecological traps.
   Human-mediated leopard mortality occurred mostly in prime leopard
   habitat. Finer-scaled management units resulted in fewer ecological
   traps and more refugia, and enables authorities to focus conservation
   attention in areas of concern. Human-mediated leopard mortality exceeded
   the annual offtake rate considered sustainable. Our study highlights the
   importance of assessing both the scale and distribution of the harvest,
   whilst also considering alternative forms of offtake, when devising
   harvest management strategies. Management scale mismatching and high
   human-mediated leopard mortality is of particular concern in Limpopo
   Province, as such, we propose an adaptive, science-based regulatory
   framework aimed at improving leopard harvest strategies.},

Title = {Life on the edge: habitat fragmentation limits expansion of a restored
   carnivore},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {108-119},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The successful recovery of imperiled species is dependent on knowledge
   of how demographic drivers mediate population growth and expansion. One
   of the largest species restoration projects has been the reintroduction
   of swift foxesVulpes veloxto southern Canada, where 947 foxes were
   released between 1983 and 1997. Swift foxes have since increased and
   expanded their range into northern Montana (USA), but have experienced a
   population decline and stall in recolonization over the past 10 years.
   The objective of this study was to estimate the survival and
   reproductive rates of swift foxes in northern Montana, which constitutes
   the southern edge of this population. In addition, we evaluated support
   for two different hypotheses of how environmental factors and several
   demographic factors influence survival. Although our length of
   monitoring was relatively short, we found that adult and juvenile annual
   survival rates were 54\% and 74\%, respectively, and fecundity was 0.85.
   We found the most support for the hypothesis that the percentage of
   native grassland at the 1-km scale influenced survival and found that
   survival increased, on average, 2.1\% for every 5\% increase in
   grassland. Compared to previous estimates of swift fox population growth
   immediately following the release, our data suggest the population is
   currently stable. The long-term successful recolonization and
   connectivity of swift fox populations in this region will likely be
   dependent on maintaining large tracts of contiguous grassland. Comparing
   the estimates of demographic rates among different points in space and
   time should help managers better understand the population dynamics and
   inform restoration strategies for recovering populations.},

Title = {Loss of urban forest canopy and the effects on neighborhood soundscapes},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {249-270},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The urban landscape constitutes a key aspect of human - nature
   interactions, as more than 60\% of the world's population resides in
   cities and their suburbs. This study focuses on the characteristics of
   the landscape that humans (and other organisms) perceive as sound and
   the role of a suburban soundscape in defining experience of place.
   Vegetation plays an important role in shaping soundscapes, both by
   creating sound and attenuating sound from natural and human sources. An
   invasive insect pest, the Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis), is
   killing millions of ash trees (genus Fraxinus) throughout North America.
   As a result, many municipalities are systematically removing Fraxinus
   trees. The objective of this research was to determine if and how
   removal of a substantial amount of the urban forest in such a community
   causes changes in the local soundscape, particularly in the proportion
   of human-sourced sounds versus sounds associated with nature. We
   selected Arlington Heights, Illinois, as the study site, where a series
   of before-and-after sound recordings were gathered as ash trees were
   removed between 2013 and 2015. Comparison of recordings using the Raven
   sound analysis program revealed significant differences in some measures
   of sound attributes tested as tree canopy decreased. We detected more
   human-produced mechanical sounds (anthrophony) and fewer sounds
   associated with weather (geophony) in these sites. Changes in sounds
   associated with animals (biophony) varied seasonally. We conclude that
   monitoring changes in the proportions of anthrophony, biophony and
   geophony provides insight into fauna biodiversity and the human
   experience of a suburban ecosystem.},

Title = {Density and movements of mainland clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa)
   under conditions of high and low poaching pressure},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite its high risk of extinction in the wild, little is known about
   the ecology and population status of the mainland clouded leopard
   (Neofelis nebulosa). We used camera-traps and spatial capture-recapture
   analysis to estimate mainland clouded leopard density within southern
   Thailand's Khlong Saeng - Khao Sok Forest Complex, comparing densities
   in two zones of the forest with different levels of human access and
   poaching pressure (core and edge). Over 5242 trap-days, we detected at
   least 27 mainland clouded leopards, including 12 females and 15 males.
   Model averaged density in the less accessible core zone (5.06 +/- SE
   1.64/100 km(2)) was 62\% higher compared to the more accessible and more
   heavily hunted edge zone (3.13 +/- SE 1.05/100 km(2)). This density
   difference corresponded to a 56\% higher occupancy probability of
   muntjacs (Muntiacus spp.) in the core zone, a potentially important prey
   species for clouded leopards. Model averaged movements (sigma) of male
   clouded leopards were 38\% larger (3448 m; SE 551 m) than female
   movements (2502 m; SE 478 m). Mainland clouded leopard density at our
   study site was among the highest recorded in South and Southeast Asia
   (range: 0.40 to 5.14/100 km(2)). We hypothesize this high density might
   be related to the extirpation of larger sympatric carnivores. Our study
   provides important baseline information for monitoring the conservation
   status of mainland clouded leopards in Thailand and Southeast Asia and
   offers insights into the species' behavioral ecology and capacity to
   adapt to human disturbance. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Deadly trap or sweet home? The case of discarded containers as novelty
   microhabitats for ants},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The presence of anthropogenic waste in the environment is one of the
   most pervasive pollution problems affecting wildlife around the world.
   Among different types of rubbish, beverage containers represent an
   ecological trap for invertebrates. However, it also may serve as a nest
   site. In the present study, we aim to assess if ants can exploit
   discarded containers as nesting sites, the intensity of mortality of ant
   workers foraging discarded containers, and ant preferences toward
   particular features of containers. The study was conducted in September
   2018 in 10 woodland areas in the city of Wroclaw, Poland. In total,
   4.4\% of 939 collected containers were used as nest sites by four ant
   species. Additionally, we found 698 dead workers, representatives of at
   least 11 species, in 10.3\% of investigated containers. Most frequently,
   ants inhabited brown plastic and glass bottles, and an increase in neck
   diameter of containers decreased the possibility of nest occurrence.
   Dead workers were marginally significantly more often found in
   colourless glass bottles when compared to brown ones and were more
   frequent in sweet drink and vodka bottles than in beer bottles.
   Additionally, larger capacity increased the frequency of occurrence of
   dead ants. Although ants use anthropogenic waste as nest sites, it
   predominantly appears as a threat for foraging ant workers, most
   probably attracted by the smell of fermenting beverages or decomposing
   carcasses of previously trapped animals. Thus, to protect species
   inhabiting human-disturbed habitats, we suggest developing tools helping
   to prevent the accumulation of waste in urban woodlands. (C) 2020 The

Title = {Biological corridors as important habitat structures for maintaining
   bees in a tropical fragmented landscape},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {187-197},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Biological corridors are an important conservation strategy to increase
   connectivity between populations-mainly vertebrates-in fragmented
   landscapes, which often require habitat restoration to achieve physical
   connections. Non-target groups such as bees could benefit from corridors
   while contributing to the restoration process given their role as
   pollinators, but little is known about the use of corridors by bees.
   Here we assessed the habitat value for bees of four biological corridors
   in the Colombian Andes by comparing bee species richness, community
   composition and functional diversity between corridors (which had two
   land-cover sections: riparian forest and restored forest), forest
   patches being connected by corridors and surrounding pastures. We found
   a higher species richness in riparian than in restored sections of
   corridors, which was comparable to that in forest and higher than in
   pasture. Community composition in forest and riparian sections were
   similar and differed from that in pasture. In contrast, functional
   diversity was similar among all land-use types, suggesting a higher
   species redundancy in forest and riparian corridors, given the higher
   species richness, compared to pastures. Our results show that riparian
   corridors are holding forest-associated species that could not survive
   in pastures, and given the higher redundancy, can significantly
   contribute to the maintenance of pollination services in fragmented
   landscapes. Our results also indicate that 13 years of restoration
   process have not been sufficient to reach reference levels (i.e.
   forest/riparian) in terms of bee species richness, but the recovery of
   some forest-associated species points to the potential of biological
   corridors to functionally connect forest patches.},

Title = {Conservation implications of habituation in Nubian ibex in response to
   ecotourism},

Abstract = {Increased fragmentation and easier access to natural areas (e.g.
   ecotourism) is bringing man in closer contact to wild populations. Such
   encounters, even when they don't pose a direct threat to wildlife, may
   induce behavioral changes in animals that in the long run may have
   negative fitness consequences. We studied changes to the
   vigilance/group-size effect in Nubian ibex Capra nubiana in response to
   increased non-threatening anthropogenic disturbance in six sites,
   subject to different levels of ecotourism. In each site we regressed the
   average time ibex individuals devoted to vigilance on the size of the
   group they were with. We then compared the slopes and intercepts of the
   vigilance/group-size function between the six sites. We complimented
   these data with a study of how flight initiation distance (FID) changed
   between the six sites, as an indicator of the level of tolerance that
   ibex exhibit to increased anthropogenic presence. We found that as
   anthropogenic presence increased the vigilance/group-size function waned
   (i.e. the group-size effect was weaker). These findings were associated
   with reduced FID reflecting increased levels of tolerance, likely as a
   result of habituation in sites subject to high levels of ecotourism. The
   loss of the vigilance response as a function of group size may decrease
   the behavioral diversity in the ibex population. Wildlife habituation to
   increased non-threatening human activity alters key behavioral
   attributes that may ultimately impact social structure and other
   fitness-related characteristics.},

Title = {Functional compensation by insular scavengers: the relative
   contributions of vertebrates and invertebrates vary among islands},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {When the extinction of some species results in loss of ecosystem
   functions, other species may be able to compensate for this loss.
   Functional compensation has recently been observed on islands where
   species are likely to become extinct; however, few studies have analysed
   functional compensation by scavengers in insular environments. Here, we
   investigated the ecosystem functions of vertebrate and invertebrate
   scavengers on Honshu, the main island of Japan, and offshore islands
   (four of the Oki Islands). The Oki Islands lack several native
   vertebrate scavengers (raccoon dogs, boars, martens, and foxes) that are
   abundant on Honshu. We experimentally placed mouse carcasses on the
   forest floors of Honshu (12 sites) and the Oki Islands (7 sites on Dgo,
   4 sites on Nishinoshima, 4 sites on Nakanoshima, and 3 sites on
   Chiburijima) in September-October 2014 and 2015. Nearly all of the mouse
   carcasses (95-100\%) placed on the forest floor disappeared within 1
   week. However, the relative importance of vertebrate and invertebrate
   scavengers varied among islands. Vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers
   contributed equally on Honshu (carcass removal by vertebrates, 47\%),
   whereas vertebrate scavengers rarely contributed to carcass removal on
   three of the Oki Islands (carcass removal by vertebrates: 17\% on Dgo,
   30\% on Nishinoshima, and 5\% on Nakanoshima). Consequently,
   invertebrate scavengers (Nicrophorus burying beetles) functionally
   compensated for the low species diversity of vertebrate scavengers on
   the three islands (carcass burial by Nicrophorus beetles, 65-95\%).
   However, on the small island of Chiburijima, introduced raccoon dogs
   contributed to nearly all of the removals (93\%), suggesting that
   introduced scavengers can compensate for the functional reduction. This
   functional compensation by scavengers may help stabilise the functions
   and/or services of scavengers in island environments.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Coastal habitats are critical for conservation of migrant shorebirds. We
   examined the effect of beach closure on recreationists and on
   shorebirds, at an important southbound stopover area for shorebirds at
   Brigantine, New Jersey. The study had three prongs: 1) involve
   stakeholders during all phases, 2) assess public use of the beach and
   responses to closure, and 3) assess shorebird use of the beach and
   response to closure. Stakeholders were involved in the design,
   implementation and evaluation of the project. The beach was used for
   fishing, walking, dog-walking, and other recreational activities. Sixty
   percent of recreationists were positive about the study and beach
   closure to protect shorebirds. The data indicate that: 1) involving a
   wide range of stakeholders early and often was important to our ability
   to conduct, design, and implement the study, 2) the beach was used by
   different types of recreationists 3) beach users were supportive of the
   closure, 4) spatial use by shorebirds depended upon whether the beach
   was open or closed, especially for red knot, and 5) all species of
   shorebirds used a small beach area behind a protective fence whether the
   beach was open or closed. Red knot behavior was most affected by beach
   closure; they spread out over the entire beach when it was closed, and
   concentrated at the tip when it was open. Conservation measures should
   take into account stakeholders views, human uses, beach physiognomy, and
   potential closure of refuge areas during critical migration times for
   shorebirds.},

Title = {Defining ecological and socially suitable habitat for the reintroduction
   of an apex predator},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Reintroducing native carnivores risks creating conflict with people and
   consequently reducing support for coexistence and conservation efforts.
   Determining the interface between areas of ecological suitability and
   conflict risk can help enhance success of carnivore restoration, but
   this is often difficult because accurate data on risks and tolerance are
   lacking. Gray wolves (Canis lupus), a focus of reintroduction efforts in
   the US, require tolerance to persist in human-dominated landscapes but
   also catalyze societal-level conflicts throughout their global range.
   Via an unprecedented process to restore an apex predator, in November
   2020, citizens in the state of Colorado, USA voted to reintroduce wolves
   to the state where they had been extirpated similar to 70 years prior.
   We leveraged voting records of over three million citizens to quantify
   and map an index of tolerance for wolves and combined it with spatially
   explicit data on livestock distributions and land ownership to create
   predictions of direct conflict risk between wolves and humans. Conflict
   risk was juxtaposed with estimates of wolf ecological suitability
   developed using seasonal prey densities along with environmental and
   anthropogenic features that influence wolf habitat use. Our
   social-ecological modeling approach predicted that similar to 56 \% of
   the West Slope of Colorado contained ecologically suitable habitat and
   relatively low conflict risk. Our models also delineated possible
   conflict hotspots where ecological suitability and conflict risk
   converge, thus facilitating targeted proactive management. We
   demonstrate how voting patterns can provide unique, spatially explicit
   insight on tolerance that can be integrated with other information to
   help facilitate human-carnivore coexistence and carnivore restoration
   success.},

Title = {Factors driving human-wild pig interactions: implications for wildlife
   conflict management in southern parts of India},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Abstract = {The expanding population of wild pig (Sus scrofa) and the associated
   economic loss has been a challenge for the government and conservation
   biologists, for over a decade globally. Unlike the majority of other
   wildlife, rising anthropogenic pressure offered wild pigs a suitable
   environment to expand their population. Accordingly, the circumstances
   for social conflict also increased at human-wildlife interface areas.
   Understanding the regional ecological landscape factors driving the
   human-wild pig conflict (HWPC) is vital for developing efficient
   strategies for HWPC management. We analyzed the important spatial and
   ecological factors determining HWPC across the Eastern and Western Ghats
   region of Tamil Nadu, India through semi-structured interviews of local
   communities. Fifty seven percent (n = 825) of the villagers surveyed (n
   = 1460) reported frequent wild pig conflict, principally in the form of
   crop damage (n = 819), especially in areas adjoining the forest
   boundary. Our study indicated that the probability of HWPC was
   positively correlated to the diversity of major and minor crops grown,
   percent crop cover and distance to the nearest water body, and
   negatively correlated to the degree of slope of the landscape and
   average annual rainfall. We identified 6729 km 2 of the total sampled
   area (22,525 km(2)) of high HWPC. Our HWPC hotspot map provides a
   concise view of the conflict pattern across the larger landscapes that
   can help the authorities prioritize areas and concentrate the conflict
   mitigation measures towards areas that require immediate attention.},

Title = {As the Goose Flies: Migration Routes and Timing Influence Patterns of
   Genetic Diversity in a Circumpolar Migratory Herbivore},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Migration schedules and the timing of other annual events (e.g., pair
   formation and molt) can affect the distribution of genetic diversity as
   much as where these events occur. The greater white-fronted goose (Anser
   albifrons) is a circumpolar goose species, exhibiting temporal and
   spatial variation of events among populations during the annual cycle.
   Previous range-wide genetic assessments of the nuclear genome based on
   eight microsatellite loci suggest a single, largely panmictic population
   despite up to five subspecies currently recognized based on phenotypic
   differences. We used double digest restriction-site associated DNA
   (ddRAD-seq) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data to re-evaluate
   estimates of spatial genomic structure and to characterize how past and
   present processes have shaped the patterns of genetic diversity and
   connectivity across the Arctic and subarctic. We uncovered previously
   undetected inter-population differentiation with genetic clusters
   corresponding to sampling locales associated with current management
   groups. We further observed subtle genetic clustering within each
   management unit that can be at least partially explained by the timing
   and directionality of migration events along with other behaviors during
   the annual cycle. The Tule Goose (A. a. elgasi) and Greenland subspecies
   (A. a. flavirostris) showed the highest level of divergence among all
   sampling locales investigated. The recovery of previously undetected
   broad and fine-scale spatial structure suggests that the strong cultural
   transmission of migratory behavior restricts gene flow across portions
   of the species' range. Our data further highlight the importance of
   re-evaluating previous assessments conducted based on a small number of
   highly variable genetic markers in phenotypically diverse species.},

Title = {Nonnative plant shifts functional groups of arthropods following drought},

Abstract = {Nonnative plants alter the composition of native plant communities, with
   concomitant effects on arthropods. However, plant invasions may not be
   the only disturbance affecting native communities, and multiple
   disturbances can have compounding effects. We assessed the effects of
   invasion and drought on plant and arthropod communities by comparing
   grasslands dominated by nonnative Old World bluestem grasses (OWBs,
   Dichanthium annulatum) to grasslands dominated by native plants during a
   period of decreasing drought severity (2011-2013). Native plant
   communities had more species of plants and arthropods (/m(2)) than areas
   dominated by OWBs during extreme drought, but richness was comparable as
   drought severity decreased. Abundance of arthropods was greater in
   native plant communities than in OWB communities during extreme drought,
   but OWB communities had more arthropods during moderate and non-drought
   conditions. We observed a shift in the arthropod community from one
   dominated by detritivores to one dominated by herbivores following plant
   invasion; the magnitude of this shift increased as drought severity
   decreased. Both plant communities were dominated by nonnative
   arthropods. A nonnative leafhopper (Balclutha rubrostriata) and native
   mites (Mochlozetidae) dominated OWB communities as drought severity
   decreased, and OWBs may serve as refugia for both taxa. Nonnative
   woodlice (Armadillidium vulgare) dominated native plant communities
   during extreme and non-drought conditions and abundance of this species
   may be associated with an increase in plant litter and available
   nutrients. Given the importance of arthropods for ecosystem services,
   incorporating arthropod data into conservation studies may demonstrate
   how changes in arthropod diversity alter ecosystem function where
   nonnative plants are dominant.},

Title = {White-tailed Deer and Balsam Woolly Adelgid Effects on Balsam Fir in
   Canaan Valley},
Journal = {SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Abies balsamea (Balsam Fir) was historically abundant in parts of West
   Virginia, but it was drastically reduced by extensive logging around the
   turn of the 19th-20th centuries. More recently, intense herbivory by
   Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) and an infestation of Adelges
   piceae (Balsam Woolly Adelgid), among other possible factors, have
   caused Balsam Fir to decline in the region. Understanding the impacts of
   White-tailed Deer and Balsam Woolly Adelgid is important for restoring
   Balsam Fir in Canaan Valley. On the Freeland Tract of the Canaan Valley
   National Wildlife Refuge, we surveyed the intensity of browsing on
   Balsam Fir and estimated deer population levels, while Refuge personnel
   assessed the intensity of the adelgid infestation. Even though estimates
   of deer density were significantly greater during 1999-2000 than in
   2001-2002, the percent of buds browsed was similar during the two
   periods. During 2001-2002, browsing was more intense on Balsam Fir trees
   that were outside than on trees inside an exclosure. Deer had minimal to
   moderate impact on mature trees, but in many cases, they completely
   browsed all of the buds on trees <3.3 ft (1 m) tall. The proportion of
   trees infested by Balsam Woolly Adelgid rose by 17.4\%-from 51.3\% in
   2000 to 68.7\% in 2002. The average diameter at breast height of Balsam
   Firs heavily infested by adelgids was significantly larger than of those
   trees classified as moderate, light, or not infested. The Balsam Woolly
   Adelgid is of greater conservation concern than White-tailed Deer
   because some of the trees tallied in the first phase of our survey were
   already dead. Restoration efforts that involve the planting of seedlings
   should consider the impacts of deer on seedlings and the impacts of
   adelgids on mature trees.},

Title = {Reductions in body size of benthic macroinvertebrates as a precursor of
   the early Toarcian (Early Jurassic) extinction event in the Lusitanian
   Basin, Portugal},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {45},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Reduction of body size is a common response of organisms to
   environmental stress. Studying the early Toarcian succession in the
   Lusitanian Basin of Portugal, we tested whether the shell size of
   benthic marine communities of bivalves and brachiopods changed at and
   before the global, warming-related Toarcian oceanic anoxic event
   (T-OAE). Statistical analyses of shell size over time show that the mean
   shell size of communities decreased significantly before the T-OAE. This
   trend is distinct in brachiopods and is caused by larger-sized species
   becoming less abundant over time, whereas it is not significant in
   bivalves, suggesting a decoupled response to environmental stress.
   Reductions in shell size precede the decline in standardized
   sample-level species richness associated with the early Toarcian
   extinction event. Such decreases in the shell size of marine
   invertebrates, well before the onset of biodiversity change, suggest
   that reductions in body size more generally may be a precursor of a
   subsequent loss of species and turnover at the community level caused by
   climate change. Sedimentological evidence is against hypoxia as a driver
   of extinction and the preceding size decrease in the brachiopod fauna in
   the studied succession, although low oxygen levels are widely held
   responsible for elevated early Toarcian extinction rates globally.
   Reduction of mean shell size in brachiopods but stasis in bivalves is
   difficult to explain with ocean acidification, because experimental work
   shows that brachiopods can be resilient to lowered pH, albeit long-term
   metabolic costs and potential evolutionary adaptations are unknown.
   Rising early Toarcian temperatures in the Lusitanian Basin seem to be a
   plausible factor in both diversity decline associated with the T-OAE and
   the preceding reductions in mean shell size, because thermal tolerances
   in modern bivalves are among the highest within marine invertebrates.},

Title = {Raccoon (Procyon lotor) in Iberia: Status update and suitable habitats
   for an invasive carnivore},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Raccoons are American carnivores, considered invasive across several
   countries worldwide, especially in Europe. In the Iberian Peninsula,
   previous studies on raccoons documented several breeding populations in
   Spain a decade ago and only two confirmed records from isolated
   individuals in Portugal. Given the need for updating its Iberian
   distribution and identifying suitable areas with higher invasion risk,
   we compiled presence records from established breeding populations and
   isolated individuals. By using a Maxent approach based on breeding
   re-cords, we forecasted the suitable habitats in Iberia with higher
   invasion risk for raccoons and identified the related environmental
   drivers. Overall, we collected 1039 records of raccoon presence
   throughout the Iberian Peninsula, including 980 records from established
   breeding populations. Their origin is probably linked to es -capes from
   captivity. Climatic conditions, linked to both drier and wetter
   environments, and proximity to water bodies were the main predictors of
   suitable areas for raccoon's expansion from the currently established
   breeding nuclei in Iberia. The forecasted high probability areas showed
   a wide, but fragmented distribution concentrated on four main areas:
   central, central-north, central-east, and north-west Iberia. NW Portugal
   seems to be the area with higher invasion risk in the country, although
   field surveys showed no evidence of raccoon presence yet. However, there
   are several records in Spain near the Portuguese border, comprising
   isolated individuals and breeding populations. Therefore, it is crucial
   to ensure regular monitoring of areas with high invasion risk,
   particularly those near facilities with captive raccoons that often act
   as a source of feral individuals, to assure early detection and
   effective control for the expansion of this invasive carnivore.},

Title = {Long-term changes in the tree and shrub layers of a British nature
   reserve and their relevance for woodland conservation management},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {51-60},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Changes in the woodland extent over the last 200 years were assessed
   from old maps for a 100 ha woodland nature reserve in southern Britain.
   More detailed changes in the composition and structure of the tree and
   shrub layers were measured using data from 95 permanent vegetation plots
   (10 x 10 m) distributed across the reserve at the intersections of a
   100m grid. These were recorded in 1973, 1992 and 2009. The woodland area
   has more than doubled since the 18th century, but whereas the pre-1800
   woodland was mainly Fagus sylvatica the more recent woodland was
   initially predominantly conifer plantation. These plantations have since
   developed into mainly broadleaved high forest of Fraxinus excelsior and
   Acer pseudoplatanus. Changes on the site are the combination of active
   interventions through management and natural processes (differential
   species growth, death from disease, windthrow, herbivore damage).
   Further changes are likely in future in particular from ash dieback
   (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus) and climate change impacts. Many of the
   changes seen on this reserve are mirrored in woods elsewhere in Britain
   and Europe. Over periods of a few decades and at the whole-reserve scale
   the woods can be considered to be relatively stable; at the plot level,
   or over time-scales of centuries they are very dynamic. Whether woods
   are judged to be resilient must include definition of the temporal and
   spatial scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Large terrestrial carnivores are particularly prone to factors
   constraining levels of population genetic diversity because of their low
   densities and high spatial requirements. We studied the pattern of
   Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx population genetic variability in the
   westernmost part of its natural range from Scandinavia to the Carpathian
   Mountains (north-central Europe) based on 190 samples using 613 base
   pair-long sequences from the mitochondrial DNA control region
   (mtDNA-cr). We examined whether the population history or contemporary
   habitat constraints of this large and mobile carnivore could have
   significantly affected its genetic structure. We recorded nine mtDNA
   haplotypes, including five not previously reported. Lynx from Latvia and
   Estonia had the highest variability with haplotype and nucleotide
   diversities of 0.810.88\% and 0.440.47\%, respectively. In contrast,
   there was no polymorphism present in peripheral populations from Norway
   and the Carpathian Mountains. Lynx populations were strongly
   differentiated {[}analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA): F ST?=?0.570,
   P?<?0.001, F ST?=?0.464, P?<?0.001)]. Spatial Analysis of Molecular
   Variance identified four separate groups of populations: (1) Norway,
   Finland and Estonia; (2) Latvia and North Eastern Poland; (3) the
   Bialowieza Primeval Forest; (4) the Carpathians. The patterns of genetic
   diversity and differentiation suggested a number of discrete populations
   that are poorly connected by contemporary gene flow and could therefore
   be considered demographically independent. The peripheral location of
   these populations, habitat fragmentation and the strict territorial
   structure of lynx populations are factors likely contributing to the
   observed patterns. The study provides suggestions for active
   conservation/management decisions including translocations or
   reintroductions of lynx.},

Title = {Assessing the economic impact of COVID-19 on the private wildlife
   industry of South Africa},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The world of travel and tourism have perhaps changed forever as a result
   of COVID-19; considered the worst global pandemic to affect the world,
   post World War II. The spread of the Coronavirus diseases was
   considerably attributed to the travel and tourism industry, and with the
   attempt to curb the spread of the virus, the industry experienced
   calamitous effects and suffered staggering financial losses. The same
   accounts for wildlife tourism (Southern Africa's largest product) -
   bringing the hunting and ecotourism sector of South Africa to a complete
   standstill. The pandemic accompanied concerning and devastating effects,
   not only from a financial point of view, but also in terms of the
   conservation of these sectors within the industry. This paper presents a
   comprehensive analysis using the data obtained from the members of
   Wildlife Ranching South Africa (WRSA) to quantify the actual and
   potential financial losses in the private wildlife industry due to
   cancellations of hunters and ecotourists, live game sales and finally,
   game meat sales in the industry. From the results, the estimated
   financial impact of COVID-19 on the private wildlife industry is R6.694
   billion (ZAR). The study made the following three contributions:
   Firstly, it determined the economic impact of COVID-19 on the private
   wildlife industry. Secondly, it provides the industry with a tangible
   document that can be used in securing funding and assistance from
   government and other non-profit organisations. Thirdly, it shows the
   importance of this industry to the South African economy and employment,

Abstract = {This study investigated the home range and habitat characteristics in
   tawny owls (Strix aluco), a grade II endangered wildlife species from
   South Korea. We tracked a breeding pair in Gyeongbuk during their
   brooding period using an attached radio transmitter through a satellite
   tracking system (WT-300: GPS-Mobile phone based Telemetry). The subjects
   had consecutively reproduced in a same nest for two years (2016-2017).
   The female's location data (six coordinates) were collected in 2016,
   whereas the male's (12 coordinates) were collected in 2017. Kernel
   density estimates were used to determine the pair's core habitats; the
   male had a greater movement range (2,133,971 m(2)) at 95\% kernel
   density estimate than the female (19,572 m(2)). The male's core habitat
   was mostly mixed forest (50.6\%), followed by coniferous forest
   (13.4\%), nonirrigated land (10.9\%), natural grassland (10.1\%), and
   inland bodies of water (8.2\%). The female's core habitat was dominated
   by mixed forest (36.8\%), followed by non-natural barren land (21.7\%),
   nonirrigated land (14.4\%), residential areas (10\%), and transportation
   areas (7.9\%). This study is the first to track a breeding tawny owl
   pair on the Korean peninsula through direct satellite. Our results
   provide fundamental data as a case study regarding home range behavior
   of an owl breeding pair for developing conservation and management plan.

Title = {Impacts of laurel wilt disease on arthropod herbivores of North American
   Lauraceae},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {493-503},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {For approximately 15years, Raffaelea lauricola and its vector, Xyleborus
   glabratus (redbay ambrosia beetle), have been causing extensive
   mortality of North American plants in the Lauraceae. All species of
   Lauraceae native to the USA that have been tested thus far are
   susceptible to the pathogen. Ecological impacts will likely continue to
   radiate outwards through ecosystems, yet there is no database of at-risk
   arthropod species that could be affected by this ecological disturbance.
   Endangerment risks remain unquantified, even for known obligate
   specialists of laurel wilt susceptible hosts, such as the palamedes
   swallowtail (Papilio palamedes Drury). We used exhaustive literature
   searches and expert-based quality control measures to catalogue native
   arthropod herbivores of Lauraceae species. Arthropods were assigned an
   endangerment risk rating based on the extent of their specialization on
   susceptible hosts. Overall, 178 native arthropod species from 7 orders
   were catalogued as herbivores that could be impacted by declines of
   their Lauraceous host plants. Twenty-four insect species were identified
   as obligate specialists of Lauraceae. A further four species were
   categorized moderate risk of endangerment because they have one host
   that is not affected by laurel wilt. As a case study, we also quantified
   the impacts of laurel wilt on palamedes swallowtail populations. The
   mean number of palamedes swallowtails encountered in transects through
   laurel wilt infested stands was nearly sixfold less than in uninfested
   stands. This suggests dire consequences for the palamedes swallowtail,
   and warrants concern for the other 24 native species that are obligate
   specialists of laurel wilt susceptible host plants.},

Title = {African Penguin tolerance to humans depends on historical exposure at
   colony level},
Journal = {BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {307-322},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sustainable ecotourism requires careful management of human impacts on
   wildlife. Contrasting responses to the disturbance caused by ecotourism
   are observed across taxa and within species, because species and
   populations can differ in their tolerance to humans. However, the
   mechanisms by which tolerance develops remain unclear. Penguin colonies
   are popular tourist attractions. Although ecotourism increases public
   awareness and generates conservation income, it can also disturb
   penguins, raising concerns for threatened species such as the African
   Penguin Spheniscus demersus, whose populations are in rapid decline. We
   compared the tolerance of African Penguins to human disturbance across
   four colonies with contrasting histories of human exposure. Human
   approaches invoked the least response at colonies where human exposure
   was highest, suggesting increased human tolerance with increased
   exposure. The response to humans close to the nest also decreased more
   rapidly in highly exposed individuals within colonies. These results
   were consistent independent of breeding stage, and were repeated among
   colonies. Because the impacts of human disturbance, including temporary
   nest desertion, were greatest at the colony with least human exposure,
   human disturbance of breeding African Penguins potentially may be
   mitigated through increased levels of tolerance to humans, or
   displacement of shyer individuals, although this could not be assessed
   in the present study.
   However, human exposure could significantly increase stress, impair
   reproduction and even reduce genetic diversity. Consequently, ecotourism
   must be managed carefully to minimize population level impacts,
   potentially by facilitating habituation in populations subject to
   non-threatening human disturbance, and maintaining some areas free of
   disturbance to allow shy individuals to breed.},

Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY OF NEW SOUTH WALES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {B3-B6},
Abstract = {The study of national history in all its forms has been at the core of
   Royal National Park, one of the first national parks in the world, since
   its very beginnings in 1879. Along with the neighbouring Heathcote
   National Park, it has played an important part in the foundation of the
   conservation movement in Australia and the basis for national park
   management throughout the country. On 29-30 September 2011, the Linnean
   Society of NSW convened a symposium on the natural history of Royal
   National Park and its surrounds, bringing together a wealth of research
   on a broad spectrum of topics that reflect the diverse values and
   management issues of the area. As a prelude to the proceedings of the
   Symposium, I outline the challenges and opportunities facing managers
   and researchers alike. These include the need to clearly identify and
   prioritise issues and topics most in need of attention, constraints
   imposed by limited resources and utilisation of expertise and skills
   locally and willingly available. Also, I discuss some unique tools and
   techniques managers use to understand, utilise and implement
   recommendations from research undertaken in the Park every year.
   Finally, I look at where we can go from our current situation, to make
   better and more targeted use of research and experts to help shape the
   future of all parks. This includes how NSW National Parks and Wildlife
   Service (NPWS) can better connect, communicate and work with research
   organisations and individual experts and volunteers alike for the mutual
   betterment of the unique environment and heritage in Royal National
   Park, and make it a centre for nature history research.},

Abstract = {In south Florida, over 100 species of native orchids occur, many of
   which need conservation efforts. Two of these species, Prosthechea
   cochleata (Clamshell Orchid) and Encyclia tampensis (Tampa Butterfly
   Orchid), are listed on Florida's Regulated Plant Index as endangered and
   commercially exploited, respectively. In this study, we covered flowers
   with fine-mesh exclusion bags and counting the number of resulting seed
   capsules to examine the capability of Clamshell Orchids to spontaneously
   self-pollinate in the field. We also examined capsule formation on
   flowers of this species that we cross-pollinated by hand in a greenhouse
   at the University of Florida. Additionally, we collected Tampa Butterfly
   Orchid seed capsules from various microhabitats at the Florida Panther
   National Wildlife Refuge. The seeds from all of these seed capsules were
   surface-sterilized and placed on a nutrient medium made for orchid
   seeds. We examined the percentage of successful germination of seeds
   from those seed capsules, either uncovered, bagged (and presumably
   self-pollinating), or hand cross-pollinated for the Clamshell Orchids,
   and from different microhabitats in south Florida for the Tampa
   Butterfly Orchid. We found that Clamshell Orchids are likely to be
   self-pollinating in the field, with over 90\% germination of seed from
   covered flowers. Additionally, there was no significant difference
   between germination from uncovered, bagged, or hand cross-pollinated
   Clamshell Orchid flowers, or between areas of the FPNWR where capsules
   were collected. The Tampa Butterfly Orchid capsules collected also
   showed no significant difference in germination between locations
   collected. The information from this study will be useful in efforts
   toward germination and out-planting of orchid species.},

Abstract = {Climate and land-use change are the major drivers of global biodiversity
   loss. Their effects are particularly acute for wide-ranging consumers,
   but little is known about how these factors interact to affect the
   abundance of large carnivores and their herbivore prey. We analyzed
   population densities of a primary and secondary consumer (mule deer,
   Odocoileus hemionus, and mountain lion, Puma concolor) across a climatic
   gradient in western North America by combining satellite-based maps of
   plant productivity with estimates of animal abundance and foraging area
   derived from Global Positioning Systems telemetry data (GPS). Mule deer
   density exhibited a positive, linear relationship with plant
   productivity (r(2)=0.58), varying by a factor of 18 across the
   climate-vegetation gradient (range: 38-697individuals/100km(2)).
   Mountain lion home range size decreased in response to increasing
   primary productivity and consequent changes in the abundance of their
   herbivore prey (range: 20-450km(2)). This pattern resulted in a strong,
   positive association between plant productivity and mountain lion
   density (r(2)=0.67). Despite varying densities, the ratio of prey to
   predator remained constant across the climatic gradient (mean +/- SE=363
   +/- 29 mule deer/mountain lion), suggesting that the determinacy of the
   effect of primary productivity on consumer density was conserved across
   trophic levels. As droughts and longer term climate changes reduce the
   suitability of marginal habitats, consumer home ranges will expand in
   order for individuals to meet basic nutritional requirements. These
   changes portend decreases in the abundance of large-bodied, wide-ranging
   wildlife through climatically driven reductions in carrying capacity, as
   well as increased human-wildlife interactions stemming from
   anthropogenic land use and habitat fragmentation.},

Abstract = {We gathered the available information about the anurofauna in Brazilian
   sand coastal plains ({''}restingas{''}) published since the 1966, which
   is the date of the first study we found that was conducted exclusively
   about anurans in these ecosystems. We made a compilation of available
   data found in publications and sought to finding a pattern on anuran
   communities of Brazilian sandy coastal plains. We found 63 published
   studies about anurans in remaining restingas along the Brazilian coast.
   We record the occurrence of 14,010 individuals, comprised of 145
   amphibian species from 12 families. The species were distributed
   latitudinally in a peculiar way, and here, we discuss this distribution
   regarding the characteristics of the species. Our results showed that
   the available existing base still does not allow us to define the
   structural patterns of the anuran communities in sandy coastal plains in
   Brazil. The relative lack of studies about the anurofauna in
   ``restingas{''} and the high rate of degradation are negative factors
   that can cause extinctions in these environments even before we
   understand the patterns and processes that act on anuran communities in
   restinga environments.},

Abstract = {Although a landscape is a single environmental system, human systems of
   governance at the landscape scale are often fragmented across
   jurisdictions and diverse stakeholders, impeding coordinated planning to
   maintain ecological connectivity. We sought solutions to overcome this
   challenge for wildlife corridor conservation in a rapidly developing,
   multifunctional landscape in one of North America's most endangered
   ecoregions. Circuitscape modelling was used to identify key wildlife
   movement corridors through our study area. We then describe how the
   results of this modelling have informed a collaborative
   multi-stakeholder process leading to shared conservation objectives
   across scales of governance and illustrate its success with our case
   study. We conclude that achieving landscape-scale conservation
   objectives requires ongoing and coordinated collaboration facilitated by
   a dedicated group of individuals and informed by science.},

Title = {Predicting impacts of sea level rise on wintering redhead ducks along
   the lower Texas Coast},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The potential impacts of sea level rise to wildlife populations and
   their habitats are of concern. Localized relative sea levels have been
   rising at elevated rates compared to global sea levels, and this trend
   will impact coastal plant communities, particularly wetlands. The Laguna
   Madre, a hypersaline lagoon, is home to nearly 80\% of North America's
   redheads (Aythya americana) during winter. The large, shallow lagoon
   provides optimal growing conditions for seagrasses, including shoalgrass
   (Halodule wrightii), the redhead's primary winter food. Adjacent to the
   Laguna Madre are coastal ponds, on which redheads rely for fresh water.
   The close proximity of these freshwater sources to the coast makes them
   vulnerable to saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise. Using Sea Level
   Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM), we modeled the impacts of sea level
   rise on coastal ponds and foraging areas along the lower Texas coast
   through the year 2100. We also determined which coastal habitat types
   would be most affected by rising sea levels. The SLAMM model indicated
   that 9 land cover types had a >= 50\% change in occurrence from the
   initial 1999 time period to 2100. The model also predicted that 93 of
   the known 156 coastal ponds would become inundated with salt water. The
   predicted loss of foraging habitat and its typical proximity to coastal
   ponds creates a need to identify where conservation and enhancement of
   wintering redhead habitat should be placed to mitigate the effects of
   sea level rise. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Impact of severe climate variability on lion home range and movement
   patterns in the Amboseli ecosystem, Kenya},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this study, we were interested in understanding if droughts influence
   the home range of predators such as lions, and if it does, in what ways
   the droughts influenced lions to adjust their home range, in response to
   prey availability. We monitored movements of ten lions fitted with
   GPS-GSM collars in order to analyze their home range and movement
   patterns over a six year period (2007-2012). We assessed the impact of a
   severe drought on the lion home range and movement patterns in the
   Amboseli ecosystem. There was a strong positive correlation between the
   home range size and distance moved in 24 h before and during the drought
   (2007-2009), while after the drought there was a significant negative
   correlation. A weak positive correlation was evident between the lion
   home range and rainfall amounts (2010-2012). The male and female home
   ranges varied over the study period. The home range size and movement
   patterns coincided with permanent swamps and areas of high prey density
   inside the protected area. Over the course of the dry season and
   following the drought, the ranges initially shrank and then expanded in
   response to decreasing prey densities. The lions spent considerable time
   outside the park boundaries, particularly after severe the drought. We
   conclude that under conditions of fragmented habitats, severe climate
   conditions create new challenges for lion conservation due to effects on
   prey availability and subsequent influences on carnivore species ranging
   patterns. Stochastic weather patterns can force wide-ranging species
   beyond current reserve boundaries, into areas where there will be
   greater conflicts with humans. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Bats exploit forest resources based on species-specific adaptations,
   resulting in differences in activity across forested landscapes. Forest
   management practices alter forests, impacting species differently and
   presumably affecting bat activity. Application of forest management that
   promotes species-specific bat conservation requires further
   understanding of bat response to silvicultural practices. We surveyed
   timber harvest treatments on two Indiana State Forests to compare bat
   activity across forest management treatments, in forests adjacent to
   harvests, and at locations across the harvest-forest gradient from May
   to July in 2013 and 2014. We used Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter SM2BAT+
   detectors and Kaleidoscope Pro analysis software to survey bats in
   relation to four treatment types: clear cut, patch cut, shelterwood
   preparatory cut, and intact forest. Detectors were deployed at two
   points within each treatment and three points on the forested periphery
   of treatments and recorded for three consecutive nights. We examined bat
   activity using N-mixture models that estimate abundance and probability
   of detection for an open population and used Akaike's Information
   Criterion to select the best models. Based on identification of acoustic
   calls, eastern red bats and hoary bats were more active in harvest
   treatments than control treatments. Big brown, eastern red, and
   ui-colored bats were most active at harvest edges. Northern long-eared
   and Indiana/little brown bats were most active at harvest edges and in
   adjacent forest and hoary bats were most active at harvest centers.
   Differences in bat activity across these managed forests suggest bat
   assemblages benefit from management that employs an array of
   silvicultural methods, provides edge habitat, and maintains adjacent
   forest stands. Our results can be used to predict effects of forest
   management practices on species-specific bat activity to maximize bat
   usage of forests.},

Title = {Feral swine Sus scrofa: a new threat to the remaining breeding wetlands
   of the Vulnerable reticulated flatwoods salamander Ambystoma bishopi},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Feral swine Sus scrofa have been implicated as a major threat to
   sensitive habitats and ecosystems as well as threatened wildlife.
   Nevertheless, direct and indirect impacts on threatened species
   (especially small, fossorial species) are not well documented. The
   decline of the U.S. federally endangered reticulated flatwoods
   salamander Ambystoma bishopi, categorized as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red
   List, has been rapid and there are few remaining breeding locations for
   this species. The flatwoods salamander depends on complex herbaceous
   vegetation in all life stages, including eggs, larvae and adults.
   Historically sets of hog tracks have been observed only occasionally in
   the vicinity of monitored reticulated flatwoods salamander breeding
   wetlands, and damage to the wetlands had never been recorded. However,
   during the autumn-winter breeding season of 2013-2014 we observed a
   large increase in hog sign, including extensive rooting damage, in known
   flatwoods salamander breeding wetlands. Our objective was to assess the
   amount of hog sign and damage in these wetlands and to take corrective
   management actions to curb additional impacts. Of 28 wetlands surveyed
   for hog sign, presence was recorded at 68\%, and damage at 54\%. Of the
   11 sites known to be occupied by flatwoods salamanders in 2013-2014,
   64\% had presence, and 55\% had damage. We found that regular monitoring
   of disturbance in wetland habitats was a valuable tool to determine when
   intervention was needed and to assess the effectiveness of intervention.
   Habitat damage caused by feral hogs poses a potentially serious threat
   to the salamanders, which needs to be mitigated using methods to control
   and exclude hogs from this sensitive habitat.},

Title = {Moth communities and agri-environment schemes: Examining the effects of
   hedgerow cutting regime on diversity, abundance, and parasitism},
Journal = {INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {6},
Pages = {543-552},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {1. Hedgerows provide an important habitat for wildlife including
   invertebrates, representing a large proportion of semi-natural habitat
   patches in the modern agricultural landscapes of the UK and Europe.
   Around 40\% of hedgerow length in England is managed under
   agri-environment scheme (AES) options, which specify less frequent
   cutting and advise cutting in winter.
   2. Hedgerow management can alter habitat structure and quality,
   potentially influencing invertebrate community structure. We assessed
   the impacts of management treatments on moth communities and their
   parasitoids. Two treatments ('cutting frequency': once every 1, 2, or 3
   years, and ` cutting time': autumn vs. winter) were applied to a
   long-running hedgerow experiment, mimicking AES prescriptions. Moth
   larvae were collected from the hedgerows, identified and reared to
   determine parasitism. Hedgerow structure and foliar quality were
   quantified and related to changes in moth abundance, diversity, species
   richness, and parasitism.
   3. Hedgerow management did not significantly affect overall abundance of
   moth larvae, but did affect the abundance of certain feeding guilds and
   trophic interactions with parasitoids. Concealed moth larvae (mining,
   tentiform, and case bearing) were more abundant on hedgerows cut
   infrequently (every 2 or 3 years vs. annually). Parasitism rates were
   higher on hedgerows cut less often, when these were cut in autumn. There
   was a strong trend towards greater moth species richness and diversity
   on winter cut hedgerows.
   4. Agri-environment scheme management can thus have complex effects on
   invertebrate communities. The abundance of some moths may be positively
   affected by AES hedgerow management and this can have knock-on effects
   on parasitoid abundance.},

Title = {Estimates of density and sustainable harvest of the lowland tapir

Year = {2014},
Volume = {48},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Amazonian moist forest, which covers most of French Guiana, is one
   of the core habitats for the lowland tapir Tapirus terrestris. Tapirs
   are hunted in French Guiana, although a law introduced in 2011 restricts
   hunting to one animal per person per hunting trip. We carried out
   camera-trap surveys in the Nouragues Nature Reserve for 4 years, with
   the goal of estimating tapir densities in undisturbed conditions and
   determining sustainable harvest levels for tapirs in French Guiana. We
   analysed our data with a Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture
   model, with parameter sharing across surveys to improve estimates, and
   used the model to calculate derived parameters such as maximum
   sustainable harvest levels. Density estimates for all four surveys were
   similar and the model indicated a difference in encounter rates for the
   two camera models used but no difference in encounter rates or home
   range sizes for males and females or between years. Based on the
   calculated density of 0.32 tapir km(-2) we estimated sustainable harvest
   levels at 0.009 tapir km(-2). Comparing this value to hunting surveys
   from 11 sites between 1999 and 2006, we found that hunting levels were
   unsustainable in at least seven villages. We conclude that even the new
   restrictive hunting law will not prevent overhunting of tapirs in
   certain areas and thus stronger regulations are needed. However, because
   of the remoteness of tapir habitat in many parts of French Guiana tapirs
   are not immediately threatened in the country as a whole.},

Title = {Are signs enough? Using normative and narrative messaging to protect the
   western snowy plover (Charadrius nivosus) in coastal Oregon},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Outdoor recreation can negatively impact wildlife. Shorebirds are
   especially sensitive because they often inhabit beaches used for
   recreation. Beaches at Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area (ODNRA)
   provide critical habitat for the federally threatened western snowy
   plover (WSPL) (Charadrius nivosus), which nests and forages in open
   sand. The ODNRA uses rope fencing and signs to communicate closures of
   WSPL habitat, but past efforts have not been highly successful. To
   improve compliance with closures, this study tested signs with messages
   based on the focus theory of normative conduct (i.e., Normative) and the
   extended elaboration likelihood model (i.e., Narrative). In an
   experimental design, the two treatment signs were compared to a control
   (an existing sign). We examined how the messages affected visitor
   attention to signs and impacted compliance with WSPL restrictions.
   Nearly 800 people were unobtrusively observed as they approached the
   sign and their reading behavior was documented. At regular intervals, an
   observer scanned the beach to count the number of people in and out of
   compliance with the regulations. Approximately one third of visitors
   read the treatment signs, while only 5\% read the control sign. The
   Narrative sign was the most effective in deterring entry into WSPL
   nesting habitat. Findings suggest that a narrative format may encourage
   visitors to perform wildlife friendly behaviors. However, because many
   visitors still recreated inside WSPL nesting habitat after being exposed
   to signs, signs should be used to supplement strategies such as fencing
   or personal contact.},

Abstract = {During 2008-2010 we investigated the ecology of the Endangered dhole or
   wild dog Cuon alpinus in Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve in the
   Eastern Himalaya in Sikkim, India. We conducted camera trapping (n=71
   sites, 6,278 camera-days) and sign surveying along trails (n=24; 629.43
   km of effort) to assess the relative abundance, distribution and
   activity pattern of the dhole. Morphological characteristics evident in
   the 61 camera-trap photographs indicate that the dhole population in the
   Reserve may be the rare and genetically distinct subspecies C. alpinus
   primaevus. We detected dholes over a wide elevation range (2,501-4,100
   m) that encompassed the upper temperate, subalpine, and alpine scrub
   zones. Dholes were diurnal, with peak activity at 08.00-10.00. Analysis
   of 41 scats indicated a diet comprising mainly mountain ungulates,
   rodents and pikas Ochotona sp. Although the frequency of occurrence of
   rodents was highest (32\%) in the scats, 98.7\% of the total biomass
   consumed was of mountain ungulates. Historical reports (1888-1894)
   indicated that the dhole was formerly abundant in Sikkim but was hunted
   to meet the high demand for its alleged medicinal properties. With no
   information on the status of the dhole in Sikkim for over a century, our
   study suggests that the species is now rare in the Reserve. To aid the
   conservation of the dhole and its main ungulate prey species extensive
   research and monitoring are required in the Reserve and elsewhere in the
   Eastern Himalaya.},

   population estimate from sighting-mark-resighting was 72 (95\% CI
   71-78). The model with different detection probabilities for males and
   females had better support than the null model. In the Sauraha area of
   Chitwan estimates of the population obtained by block count (77) and
   ID-based monitoring (72) were within the 95\% confidence interval of the
   estimate from sighting-mark-resighting. We recommend a country-wide
   block count for rhinoceroses every 3 years and annual ID-based
   monitoring in a sighting-mark-resighting framework within selected
   subpopulations. The sighting-mark-resighting technique provides the
   statistical rigour required for population estimates of the rhinoceros
   in Nepal and elsewhere.},

Title = {The impact of forest logging and fragmentation on carnivore species
   composition, density and occupancy in Madagascar's rainforests},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {Forest carnivores are threatened globally by logging and forest
   fragmentation yet we know relatively little about how such change
   affects predator populations. This is especially true in Madagascar,
   where carnivores have not been extensively studied. To understand better
   the effects of logging and fragmentation on Malagasy carnivores we
   evaluated species composition, density of fossa Cryptoprocta ferox and
   Malagasy civet Fossa fossana, and carnivore occupancy in central-eastern
   Madagascar. We photographically-sampled carnivores in two contiguous
   (primary and selectively-logged) and two fragmented rainforests
   (fragments <2.5 and <15 km from intact forest). Species composition
   varied, with more native carnivores in the contiguous than fragmented
   rainforests. F. fossana was absent from fragmented rainforests and at a
   lower density in selectively-logged than in primary rainforest (mean
   1.38 +/- SE 0.22 and 3.19 +/- SE 0.55 individuals km(-2), respectively).
   C. ferox was detected in fragments <2.5 km from forest and had similar
   densities in primary and selectively-logged forests (0.12 +/- SE 0.05
   and 0.09 +/- SE 0.04 adults km(-2), respectively) but was absent in
   fragments >15 km from forest. We identified only two protected areas in
   Madagascar that may maintain >300 adult C. ferox. Occupancy of
   broad-striped mongoose Galidictis fasciata was positively related to
   fragment size whereas occupancy of ring-tailed mongoose Galidia elegans
   elegans was negatively associated with increasing exotic wild cat (Felis
   spp.) activity at a camera site. Degraded rainforest fragments are
   difficult environments for Malagasy carnivores to occupy; there is a
   need to prioritize the reconnection and maintenance of contiguous forest
   tracts.},

Abstract = {A comprehensive expert consultation was conducted in order to assess the
   status, trends and the most important drivers of change in the abundance
   and geographical distribution of kelp forests in European waters. This
   consultation included an on-line questionnaire, results from a workshop
   and data provided by a selected group of experts working on kelp forest
   mapping and eco-evolutionary research. Differences in status and trends
   according to geographical areas, species identity and small-scale
   variations within the same habitat where shown by assembling and mapping
   kelp distribution and trend data. Significant data gaps for some
   geographical regions, like the Mediterranean and the southern Iberian
   Peninsula, were also identified. The data used for this study confirmed
   a general trend with decreasing abundance of some native kelp species at
   their southern distributional range limits and increasing abundance in
   other parts of their distribution (Saccharina latissima and Saccorhiza
   polyschides). The expansion of the introduced species Undaria
   pinnatifida was also registered. Drivers of observed changes in kelp
   forests distribution and abundance were assessed using experts'
   opinions. Multiple possible drivers were identified, including global
   warming, sea urchin grazing, harvesting, pollution and fishing pressure,
   and their impact varied between geographical areas. Overall, the results
   highlight major threats for these ecosystems but also opportunities for
   conservation. Major requirements to ensure adequate protection of
   coastal kelp ecosystems along European coastlines are discussed, based
   on the local to regional gaps detected in the study.},

Title = {Non-interacting impacts of fertilization and habitat area on plant

Abstract = {Aim: The local- and regional-based forms of anthropogenic change
   reducing grassland diversity are generally identified, but these
   scale-dependent processes tend to co-occur with unclear interactive
   effects. Here, we explicitly test how common local and regional
   perturbations simultaneously affect plant alpha and beta diversity in a
   multiyear community assembly experiment using fragments of grassland
   habitat of various sizes. We hypothesized that local disturbances and
   decreasing patch size would interact, suppressing local diversity while
   homogenizing composition among patches.
   Location: North America.
   Methods: We conducted a three-year grassland assembly experiment,
   factorially manipulating local perturbation (nitrogen addition and
   mowing) and patch area for 36 patches over 13ha. We quantified the
   individual and interactive effects of these local and regional factors
   on plant alpha and beta diversity within (quadrat scale) and among
   patches (patch scale). We also used a null model approach to disentangle
   between stochastic- and niche-based assembly mechanisms.
   Results: We detected a gradient of assembly outcomes driven by two
   non-interacting factorsthe effects of N fertilization on alpha
   (negative) and beta (positive) diversity regardless of spatial scale and
   the scale-dependant effect of increasing patch size on alpha (positive)
   and beta (positive) diversity. These effects unfolded over time, with
   the constraints on richness and composition shifting from
   dispersal-based during the first sampling year to perturbation-and
   size-based factors at year two and three. Fertilization effects were
   driven by a mixture of deterministic (i.e., selection at the species
   level) and stochastic (i.e., random extinctions) processes resulting in
   a decline in local richness but an increase in spatial heterogeneity in
   species composition. Area appeared to influence alpha diversity mainly
   via stochastic ``sampling effect{''}-larger patches represented a larger
   sample of the regional pool. Niche-based processes, however, led to
   convergence in beta diversity among smaller patches driving a positive
   overall effect of area on beta diversity.
   Main conclusion: Our results illustrate how diversity regulation in
   contemporary grasslands can be simultaneously shaped by local and
   regional factors acting additively but via contrasting assembly
   mechanisms that operate at different spatial and temporal scales.},

   herbivore interactions in Indonesian cacao},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {1. Herbivores inducing host-plant trait changes can indirectly affect
   the performance, distribution, abundance and behaviour of other
   herbivores, even when they are temporally or spatially separated.
   However, it is unclear whether this occurs at scales relevant for
   applied purposes such as pest control in agricultural crops.
   2. We studied the indirect effects of a minor pest, the mirid bug
   Helopeltis sulawesi, on the major pest of cacao Theobroma cacao in
   Southeast Asia, the pod-boring moth Conopomorpha cramerella. For 2
   years, we surveyed herbivore damage and yield in 10 focal trees in each
   of the 43 cacao plantations and analysed patterns of co-occurrence of
   the two herbivores. In a two-choice experiment, we tested whether gravid
   females of C. cramerella searching for oviposition sites discriminate
   against pods damaged by H. sulawesi.
   3. The proportion of pods affected by both pest species was
   significantly lower than expected. This pattern could not be ascribed to
   differential responses to environmental or management variables, but was
   because of avoidance of H. sulawesi damage by ovipositing C. cramerella
   females as shown in a two-choice experiment. The reduction in
   co-occurrence of damage by the two herbivores was found at tree and at
   plot scale and held across three harvest seasons.
   4. The differential yield impacts by the two herbivores and the
   avoidance by C. cramerella of pods damaged by H. sulawesi lead to a
   yield optimumat a H. sulawesi incidence of 51\%.
   5. Synthesis and application. Plant-mediated indirect interactions
   between minor and major pest insects can be important drivers of yield
   loss at agriculturally relevant spatial and temporal scales. In cacao,
   the mirid bug H. sulawesi, a minor pest, generates conspicuous damage
   which often triggers pest control with insecticides. This practice may
   be counterproductive, because decreasing H. sulawesi damage benefits the
   main pest, the cacao pod borer C. cramerella resulting in a marketable
   yield optimum at intermediate densities of the minor pest. Pest control
   recommendations should take into account the relative effect of control
   measures on interacting herbivores to avoid replacing one pest problem
   with another, potentially more serious one, during the course of a
   fruiting season.},

Title = {The Ethics of Reintroducing Large Carnivores: The Case of the California

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Efforts to reintroduce species to portions of their historic ranges are
   growing in number and kind. These include proposals and projects to
   reintroduce large carnivores in areas where these species have been
   absent for decades. Reintroductions, like all conservation efforts,
   involve not only empirical and logistical problems, but also complex
   normative questions. So, what are the obligations, values, permissions,
   restrictions, and demands that citizens, conservationists, wildlife
   managers, and other impacted parties must address? This paper attempts
   to organise, summarise and briefly analyse the diverse suite of common
   normative arguments concerning large carnivore reintroduction.
   Clarifying arguments as a methodological approach grounded in
   environmental ethics sheds light on many implicit ethical
   presuppositions that underwrite reintroduction efforts. As an example,
   we use the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), whose populations have grown in
   recent years in both Europe and North America. Whereas past efforts to
   recover grizzlies in the lower 48 U.S. states focused on the Northern
   Rockies and North Cascades, research, legal proceedings, and other
   proposals have emerged to return the species to other portions of its
   historic range, including California. Clarifying ethical arguments that
   may arise from large carnivore reintroduction can contribute to a more
   civil public discourse and effective decision-making processes.},

Title = {Wildfires, heatwaves and human disturbance threaten insular endemic bats},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {14},
Pages = {4401-4416},

Abstract = {Islands host high numbers of endemic species, and the latter are
   especially exposed to human-driven habitat alteration because their
   population size is constrained by the limited space and resources found
   in insular systems. Extreme events linked with climate change and direct
   anthropogenic stressors may synergistically affect endemic species, and
   even push them to the brink of extinction. Bats include many insular
   endemics whose life traits make them excellent candidates to test the
   effects of both climate-change driven events and direct human
   disturbance. The Mediterranean island of Sardinia is home to the endemic
   long-eared bat Plecotus sardus. Within the island, this recently
   described species is restricted to a limited range where suitable
   habitat is present. This makes the species extremely vulnerable to human
   action. Here we use Plecotus sardus as a model to assess the response of
   insular endemic bats to climate change and human disturbance, exploring
   demographic trends across two decades. Overall, roost count data for all
   known reproductive sites showed a steep (-63.4\% between 2003 and 2020)
   population decline, so that the current estimated population size is
   only 36.5\% of that observed in 2003. Colony growth rates are strongly
   affected by recurring wildfires around reproductive sites, summer
   precipitation and temperature extremes, pointing to climate change as a
   primary threat to the species along with direct human interference. Such
   anthropogenic pressures may therefore rapidly expose island endemic bats
   to a high extinction risk. Based on our analysis, Plecotus sardus is
   among the most threatened mammals, and likely the rarest bat species, in
   Europe. Thus, we urge that (1) similar assessments are conducted on
   other insular endemic bats in Mediterranean Europe, (2) IUCN Redlist
   categories are revised according to new analyses, and (3) recovery
   action plans are immediately developed and implemented to revert the
   current population trends.},

Title = {Validation of a noninvasive technique to quantify stress in northern

Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 13},
Abstract = {Examination of the endocrine system through non-invasive fecal sampling
   may improve population management more than using demographic indicators
   alone. By addressing the physiological mechanisms that are influencing
   fitness, management actions can be proactively developed to alleviate
   stressors. Proactive determination of vulnerable populations is critical
   for species of concern, such as the Northern Bobwhite (Colinus
   virginianus), which have suffered decades of population decline. We
   validated an assay to noninvasively measure the adrenocortical response
   of captive reared bobwhite through fecal corticosterone metabolites
   (FCM). All individuals received three sequential 48-hour treatments in
   which samples were collected every 4 hours, including a reference
   period, an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge and a biological
   stressor (exposure to a hunting dog). Reference FCM values had a mean
   concentration of 16.75 pg/mg (95\% CrI: 13.68, 19.91) with
   adrenocortical activity increasing by 73\% for the duration of the ACTH
   challenge (29.00 pg/mg; CrI: 25.01, 33.78). FCM concentrations remained
   similar to that of the reference levels during the biological stressor
   (16.56 pg/mg; CrI: 13.33, 19.92). Our study validates the use of feces
   to detect changes in FCM levels in our subject species but also
   demonstrates the complexity of FCM and the importance of both
   physiological and biological validation prior to field implementation.},

Abstract = {Population genetic structure of the pelagic narrow-barred Spanish
   mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson) was examined in 10 populations from
   the Indo-West Pacific region, based on mitochondrial control region DNA.
   We examined genetic composition of 56 individuals of S. commerson from
   the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and compared them with 40 individuals
   from previously published data sampled from the ROPME Seas area and
   South West Pacific Ocean. The overall nucleotide and haplotype
   diversities were estimated to be 0.072 and 0.995, respectively.
   Demographic parameters such as Tajima's D and Fu's F-s statistics were
   negative, but non-significant across all the populations, except for New
   Caledonia in the South West Pacific, indicating a stable population of
   S. commerson in this region. To assess intra-specific patterns of
   connectivity, we constructed statistical parsimony networks among
   haplotypes and estimated time of most recent population expansion. AMOVA
   and F-ST values among Indian and Arabian regions revealed
   non-significant variation among the populations, while separation was
   noted among the samples of the northern and eastern Indian oceans, as
   well as with South West Pacific. A parsimony network analysis provided
   evidence for four separate population segment/stocks in the Indian Ocean
   and Pacific Ocean, raising a conservation concern. Our results support a
   need for regional cooperation to ensure the sustainable exploitation of
   S. commerson in the Indo-West Pacific region.},

Title = {Karuk ecological fire management practices promote elk habitat in

Abstract = {1. After a century of fire suppression and accumulating fuel loads in
   North American forests, prescribed burns are increasingly used to
   prevent conditions leading to catastrophic megafire. There is widespread
   evidence that prescribed fire was used by Indigenous communities to
   manage natural and cultural resources tribes for thousands of years.
   Wildlife habitat is an example of an ecological response that was
   actively managed with prescribed burns by Indigenous American peoples
   and is an important factor in western US forest management planning,
   restoration and climate resilience efforts.
   2. We analysed the effects of modern prescribed burns informed by
   traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) on the predicted change in elk
   winter habitat in Karuk aboriginal territory in Northern California
   between 2013 and 2018 using species distribution and simultaneous
   autoregressive modelling techniques.
   3. Burn types most closely resembling Karuk traditional practices,
   specifically those incorporating multiple-year broadcast burns, had
   significant positive effects on elk winter habitat suitability.
   Conversely, concentrated burns focused solely on reducing fuel loads had
   significant negative effects on elk winter habitat suitability. However,
   areas where these fuel-reduction burns were combined with multiple years
   of broadcast burns featured the highest increases in habitat.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that transitioning to
   prescribed burns that more closely follow Karuk traditional ecological
   knowledge will promote elk habitat in the region. This would be best
   achieved through continuing to work closely with Indigenous
   representatives to plan and implement cultural fire prescriptions on a
   landscape scale, a trend we posit would benefit environmental management
   efforts across the globe.},

Title = {A systematic survey of online trade: trade in Saiga antelope horn on
   Russian-language websites},

Abstract = {Trade in wildlife is increasingly moving online, which creates
   significant challenges for monitoring. Numerous reports have highlighted
   the extent of the trade but they rarely present a methodology to
   facilitate replication or any form of meta-analysis. Here we present a
   systematic approach to surveying online trade in wildlife that builds on
   the well-established systematic evidence review approach. We apply this
   approach to investigate the online trade in saiga antelope Saiga
   tatarica horns on Russian-language websites. Of the 419 advertisements,
   the majority (217, 52\%) were from Ukraine, followed by Russia (122,
   29\%), and were largely offers to sell (254, 61\%), and represented
   one-off advertisements. Trade was identified on 89 websites, with the
   majority being on classified ads websites (68, 76\%),
   auction.violity.com being the most popular site (156, 37\%). Prices
   varied significantly depending on the country and how the horn was being
   offered (i.e. by weight or length). It is clear that saiga horn is being
   traded over the internet, with Ukraine and Russia comprising c. 80\% of
   advertisements on Russian-language websites. Individuals with single
   advertisements dominate, suggesting website fidelity, although website
   usage is country-specific, potentially reflecting domestic trade. This
   suggests country-specific interventions could be particularly effective.
   A systematic approach for investigating online wildlife trade provides a
   clear and transparent methodology, and, given data collection is
   resource-intensive, allows studies to be replicated so that trends can
   be identified. However, this is only possible if published studies
   report the methodology used.},

Title = {Identifying landscape factors affecting tiger decline in the Bangladesh
   Sundarbans},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Sundarbans Forest (similar to 10,000 km(2)) represents the only
   mangrove ecosystem inhabited by tigers Panthera tigris. However, in the
   Bangladesh portion of the Sundarbans (similar to 6,000 km(2)) tigers
   appear to have declined. The aim of this study was to examine the
   influence of a range of environmental and landscape variables in
   possible changes in the relative abundance of tigers in the Bangladesh
   Sundarbans over a five-year period (2007-2011). In 2007, 2011 tiger
   relative abundance was assessed using sign surveys. Using regression
   models we investigated changes in relative abundance versus multiple
   landscape variables (human disturbance associated with villages and
   commercial shipping lanes, distance to the international border with
   India where there is enhanced patrolling, presence of forest guard
   stations, number of criminal prosecutions and forest protection status).
   Tiger relative abundance was higher in 2007 and declined by 2011 with
   changes best explained by the proximity to international boundaries.
   This result might have been affected by the high levels of security
   patrols at the India-Bangladesh border along with cross border tiger
   movement between India and Bangladesh. Neighboring tiger range countries
   could strengthen cross-border law enforcement, increasing protection of
   dispersing animals. Particularly alarming was the absence of a positive
   effect of protected areas relative to those outside the protected area
   system or forest guard stations, implying a lack of management
   effectiveness suggesting an urgent need for an improved strategy for
   managing tigers and their habitats. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by

Journal = {AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST},

Abstract = {Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii; RBEB) and
   southeastern myotis (Myotis austroriparius; SEM) are species of concern
   whose current population statuses are unknown. Bottomland hardwood
   forests are important roosting habitat for RBEB and SEM; however, >=
   80\% of these forests have been cleared or degraded in Mississippi.
   Limited information on roost site requirements exists across either
   species ranges; therefore, we conducted roost surveys for RBEB and SEM
   in bottomland and riparian hardwood forests on Noxubee National Wildlife
   Refuge, Legion State Park, and Tombigbee National Forest, Mississippi,
   during winter 2009-2010 and spring 2010. To compare seasonal roost
   selection for each species we compared tree species, used 95\%
   confidence intervals (CIs) for three tree variables (diameter at breast
   height (DBH), cavity volume, and opening area) and logistic regression
   for four landscape variables (elevation, slope, distance to nearest
   stream, and distance to nearest road). We used Akaike's Information
   Criteria corrected for small sample size and model averaging to
   incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates of
   landscape models. Based on 95\% CIs, RBEB and SEM in winter used trees
   with greater DBH and SEM used trees with larger cavities. However,
   during spring, RBEB and SEM occupied trees with comparable DBH and
   cavity size to unoccupied trees. At the landscape scale, RBEB used roost
   trees at lower elevations during winter and spring. During spring, SEM
   used trees further from roads (Importance weight = 0.76) at lower
   elevations (Importance weight = 0.29) and with less slope (Importance
   weight = 0.25). Understanding seasonal roost site selection will improve
   our ability to protect habitat to ensure viable populations of these bat
   species.},

Title = {Soil type mediates indirect interactions between Centaurea solstitialis
   and its biocontrol agents},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1697-1710},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Many invasive plants are attacked by more than one biocontrol agent.
   Attack by multiple enemies may give rise to indirect interactions, the
   nature of which may be influenced by the abiotic environment. We
   conducted a field experiment to determine (1) whether indirect
   interactions arose between Centaurea solstitialis, a foliar pathogen and
   three insect seed predators and (2) how the outcome was influenced by
   soil type (serpentine and non-serpentine). Because serpentine soils
   support high numbers of endemic species they are a priority for
   conservation. They also have very low calcium concentrations and Ca++
   regulates plants' ability to defend against pathogen infection. C.
   solstitialis growing on serpentine soil may therefore be more vulnerable
   to the pathogen and this may in turn affect the plant's subsequent
   interactions with seed predators. We found that pathogen infection had a
   direct, negative impact on plant performance but its impact was not
   greater on serpentine plants. When attacked by the seed predators,
   inflorescences produced more viable seed when they were on plants
   infected with the pathogen than when they were on uninfected plants and
   the data suggest that this reflects reductions in larval seed-feeding.
   On the non-serpentine soil, the pathogen's direct, negative impact was
   entirely canceled out by its indirect, positive effect via reduced seed
   predation. On the serpentine soil, plants attacked by the pathogen and
   the insect seed predators produced half as many seeds than plants
   attacked only by the seed predators. Our results demonstrate that
   biocontrol agent interactions may be modified by the plant and by the
   abiotic environment in a way that fundamentally alters their net impact
   on the weed.},

Title = {Parasites, stress and reindeer: infection with abomasal nematodes is not
   associated with elevated glucocorticoid levels in hair or faeces},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {Stress hormones (glucocorticoids), incorporated into hair/fur and
   faeces, have been proposed as biomarkers of overall health in wildlife.
   Although such biomarkers may be helpful for wildlife conservation and
   management, their use has rarely been validated. There is a paucity of
   studies examining the variation of stress hormones in mammals and how
   they relate to other health measures, such as parasitism. Parasites are
   ubiquitous in wildlife and can influence the fitness of individual
   animals and populations. Through a longitudinal experiment using captive
   reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), we tested whether animals
   infected with Ostertagia gruehneri, a gastrointestinal nematode with
   negative impacts on fitness of the host, had higher stress levels
   compared with those that had been treated to remove infection. Faecal
   samples were collected weekly for 12 weeks (June-September) and hair was
   collected at the start and end of the study; glucocorticoids were
   quantified using enzyme immunoassays. Contrary to what was expected,
   infected reindeer had similar levels of cortisol in hair and slightly
   lower glucocorticoid metabolites in faeces compared with uninfected
   reindeer. Faecal corticosterone levels were higher than faecal cortisol
   levels, and only corticosterone increased significantly after a handling
   event. These results suggest that reindeer may use a tolerance strategy
   to cope with gastrointestinal nematodes and raise the question as to
   whether moderate infection intensities with nematodes are beneficial to
   the host. By removing nematodes we may have altered the gut microbiota,
   leading to the observed elevated faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels
   in the treated reindeer. These findings demonstrate the importance of
   considering both cortisol and corticosterone in physiological studies,
   as there is mounting evidence that they may have different
   functionalities.},

Title = {Impacts of grazing by different large herbivores in grassland depend on

Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1053-1062},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {It is well documented that large herbivores have pronounced effects on
   plant communities in grassland ecosystems, and the extent and course of
   their effects can largely depend on both plant and herbivore
   characteristics. Previous studies highlighted the importance of plant
   productivity in predicting the impact of herbivores on grasslands. Yet,
   there has been little consideration of how different herbivores affect
   plant communities that, in turn, differ in plant diversity. In a 2-year
   grazing experiment, we tested the effects of large herbivores (cattle or
   sheep, or both together) on plant communities under high and low plant
   diversity levels in eastern Eurasian steppe. We found that, for high
   plant diversity grassland, mixed grazing by cattle and sheep
   significantly increases plant diversity, but we found no effect of
   grazing by cattle or sheep alone. Grazing by cattle or sheep alone or
   mixed grazing by cattle and sheep did not significantly affect plant
   biomass in the high diversity grassland. However, for low plant
   diversity grassland, grazing by cattle alone and mixed grazing by cattle
   and sheep significantly increased plant diversity, but significantly
   decreased plant biomass. There was no significant impact on both plant
   diversity and biomass from sheep grazing.Synthesis and applications. We
   conclude that the effects of grazing in grassland strongly depend on
   herbivore assemblages and pre-grazing plant diversity. Herbivore grazing
   might contribute more to the maintenance of grassland structure and
   ecosystem functioning under high plant diversity compared with low plant
   diversity. Furthermore, our data suggest that multiple-species mixed
   grazing regimes in grassland systems with high plant diversity could
   represent the optimal protocol for grazing management. This study
   emphasizes the importance of maintaining both plant and herbivore
   diversity to optimize ecosystem functioning.

Title = {Genetic rescue of an isolated African lion population},

Pages = {41-53},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Fragmented wildlife populations are challenged by limited gene flow that
   can lead to significant inbreeding. The lion (Panthera leo) population
   in South Africa's Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP) started from a small
   founder population of one adult male (1958), one adult female, followed
   by two lionesses and three cubs (two females and one male; 1965;
   unrelated to the male). A genetic rescue effort was launched after signs
   of inbreeding were observed in the 1990s. Sixteen lions (13 females and
   three males) were translocated into the HiP population from Pilanesberg
   National Park and Madikwe Game Reserve. We assessed the genetic
   consequences 10 to 15 years post translocation (n = 91), using
   microsatellite markers. Structure analysis revealed integration of the
   translocated animals and evidence of a unique post-translocation genetic
   cluster. Allelic richness increased from 2.26 to 3.88, and
   heterozygosity from 0.40 to 0.65. However, overall relatedness within
   (0.19) and among (0.15) existing prides remained higher than in an open
   system, and both allelic richness and heterozygosity were declining in
   later post-translocation generations. Thus, although genetic rescue is a
   valuable tool for the recovery of inbred, isolated populations, genetic
   augmentation should be performed at regular intervals to ensure
   continued population viability.},

Abstract = {Eastern screech owls (Megascops asio) exist in a number of urban parks
   in New York City (NYC) and Westchester County, NY. To investigate the
   effects of intense urbanization on this species, we performed
   call-broadcast surveys in 16 parks in NYC and Westchester. Occupancy and
   detection were modelled as functions of eight geographic variables and
   the presence of barred (Strix varia) and great horned (Bubo virgineanus)
   owls was noted. Detection was lower in parks that had larger owls.
   Percent impervious cover and percent forest cover of buffer zones were
   the most important predictors of occupancy. Screech owls can persist in
   parks in urbanized areas, but long-term persistence appears to be
   limited by high levels of urbanization (>50-60\% impervious cover), even
   around otherwise suitable parks, probably because recolonization of
   extirpated sites in these areas is unlikely. Hence, characteristics of
   the urban matrix around parks were strong determinants of occupancy by
   eastern screech owls in these parks.},

Title = {Long-term distribution responses of a migratory caribou herd to human
   disturbance},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {177},
Pages = {52-63},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Caribou and reindeer (Rangifer spp.) are known to respond negatively to
   human activities. Disturbance stimuli can result in short-term
   behavioural responses or the abandonment of portions of seasonal range.
   There is relatively little understanding, however, of the ability of
   caribou to adapt or habituate to long-term human-caused disturbance. We
   fit species distribution models to 27 years of location data collected
   for the Porcupine caribou herd (Alaska, USA; Yukon and Northwest
   Territories, Canada) during winter. We used a novel technique to
   quantify the avoidance responses and zone of influence associated with
   human settlements, main roads and minor disturbance features including
   wells, trails, and seismic lines. We hypothesised that during the early
   period of monitoring (1985-1998), caribou would demonstrate a greater
   sensitivity to human disturbance and a larger zone of influence relative
   to industrial development. Consistent with the assumed level and timing
   of disturbance, caribou demonstrated the strongest avoidance response to
   settlements, followed by main roads and minor disturbance features. The
   data suggested that avoidance, noted as the zone of influence, was less
   during the more recent time period (1999-2012), but still relatively
   large when compared to the reported disturbance responses of other
   populations of Rangifer. A precise habituation response was obscured by
   uncertainty in the data describing human activities and variation in the
   distribution and population dynamics of the herd for such an extensive
   time period. These results suggest that the large-scale behavioural
   responses of wide-ranging mammals to disturbance stimuli are dynamic.
   The study of such responses requires accurate data describing human
   activities as well as long-term monitoring and periodic evaluation. (C)

Title = {Wild food plants and fungi sold in the markets of Luang Prabang, Lao PDR},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background Open air markets hold an important position for
   ethnobiologists. In Southeast Asia, they are seriously understudied, in
   spite of their incredible biocultural diversity. In order to fill this
   gap we recorded plants and fungi sold in the open air markets of Luang
   Prabang, Lao PDR. Methods The markets were visited 38 times in four
   seasons: the dry season, early monsoon, mid-monsoon, and end-of-monsoon,
   at least 8 times per season. All items were photographed and voucher
   specimens were collected. Fungi were identified using DNA barcoding
   techniques. Results We recorded 110 species of wild edible plants and 54
   species of fungi, including 49 wild-collected species. The sold plants
   included 86 species of green vegetables, 18 species of fruits and 3
   species of flowers. Products from woody species constitute around half
   of all taxa sold. These include the young shoots of tree leaves, which
   are used for salads-an interesting feature of Lao cuisine. A large
   number of extremely rare Russula, with no reference sequences
   represented in databases or even species unknown to science is present
   on sale in the markets. Conclusions Luang Prabang markets are some of
   the richest in species of wild edible plants and fungi in Asia, and
   indeed in the whole world. It is worth pointing out the exceptionally
   long list of wild edible mushrooms which are sold in Luang Prabang (and
   probably elsewhere in Laos). We view the Morning Market of Luang Prabang
   as a cultural treasure that unites the traditions of eating a large
   number of living species with very diverse flora and fauna. Measures
   should be taken to strike a balance between local foraging traditions
   and nature conservation priorities.},

Title = {Dietary ecology of Alaskan polar bears (Ursus maritimus) through time

Volume = {27},

Pages = {3109-3119},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Arctic climate change poses serious threats to polar bears (Ursus
   maritimus) as reduced sea ice makes seal prey inaccessible and marine
   ecosystems undergo bottom-up reorganization. Polar bears' elongated
   skulls and reduced molar dentition, as compared to their sister species
   the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), are adaptations associated with hunting
   seals on sea ice and a soft, lipid-rich diet of blubber and meat. With
   significant declines in sea ice, it is unclear if and how polar bears
   may be altering their diets. Clarifying polar bear dietary responses to
   changing climates, both today and in the past, is critical to proper
   conservation and management of this apex predator. This is particularly
   important when a dietary strategy may be maladaptive. Here, we test the
   hypothesis that hard-food consumption (i.e., less preferred foods
   including bone), inferred from dental microwear texture analysis,
   increased with Arctic warming. We find that polar bears demonstrate a
   conserved absence of hard-object feeding in Alaska through time
   (including approximately 1000 years ago), until the 21st century,
   consistent with a highly conserved and specialized diet of soft blubber
   and flesh. Notably, our results also suggest that some 21st-century
   polar bears may be consuming harder foods (e.g., increased carcass
   utilization, terrestrial foods including garbage), despite having skulls
   and metabolisms poorly suited for such a diet. Prior to the 21st
   century, only polar bears with larger mandibles demonstrated increased
   hard-object feeding, though to a much lower degree than closely related
   grizzly bears which regularly consume mechanically challenging foods.
   Polar bears, being morphologically specialized, have biomechanical
   constraints which may limit their ability to consume mechanically
   challenging diets, with dietary shifts occurring only under the most
   extreme scenarios. Collectively, the highly specialized diets and
   cranial morphology of polar bears may severely limit their ability to
   adapt to a warming Arctic.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {49},

Abstract = {1. Agricultural land use threatens ecosystem services such as biological
   control by natural enemies because of simplification of habitat
   structure and intensification of disturbance and agrochemical inputs.
   Low parasitism rates of agricultural pests have typically been
   attributed to a lack of resources for parasitoids in highly simplified
   landscapes, but this could be confounded by the nearly ubiquitous
   correlation between landscape complexity and the cover of intensively
   farmed agricultural crops. 2. Here, we disentangle the mechanisms
   driving landscape-scale effects on hostparasitoid interactions by taking
   advantage of a landscape modification gradient in which the diversity of
   habitat types and annual crop cover in the landscape were uncorrelated.
   We quantified herbivore densities and parasitism and hyperparasitism
   rates on two important crop pests (aphids and Plutella xylostella)
   across 30 landscapes. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to
   test whether land-use intensity (insecticide application and habitat
   disturbance) or resource availability for parasitoids (floral resources
   and alternative host plants) was mediating the effects of habitat
   diversity and annual crop cover on the landscape. 3. Rates of primary-
   and hyperparasitism of aphids and primary parasitism of P. xylostella
   decreased with increasing annual crop cover, whereas decreasing habitat
   diversity in the landscape had little effect on parasitism rates. These
   effects were mediated almost entirely by greater habitat disturbance and
   greater frequency of insecticide application, rather than by changes in
   resource availability. 4. Parasitoids were more sensitive to intensive
   farming practices than were their herbivore hosts, and in turn
   hyperparasitoids were more sensitive than were primary parasitoids. This
   supports the theoretical prediction that higher trophic levels should be
   increasingly sensitive to the disturbances associated with land-use
   change. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our work suggests that increased
   land-use intensity (e.g. higher insecticide inputs and greater levels of
   disturbance associated with increasing area of annual crops) has been
   underestimated as a driver of landscape effects on hostparasitoid
   interactions. These findings have important implications for the
   maintenance of ecosystem services such as biological control. The
   promotion of low-intensity farming practices that limit the extent and
   frequency of agrochemical inputs and habitat disturbances will be
   essential for the maintenance of effective biological control by
   parasitoids in agroecosystems.},

Title = {Consistent bear population DNA-based estimates regardless molecular
   markers type},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {248},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Reliability of population size and density estimates is one of the most
   contentious issues when evaluating the conservation status of species.
   Non-invasive DNA monitoring, combined with spatially explicit
   capture-recapture approaches (SCR), is recurrently presented as a
   reliable procedure to achieve accurate, precise and feasible estimates.
   However, conservation practitioners frequently face the dilemma of which
   molecular marker type would perform better for their objectives. Here,
   using as case study the eastern subpopulation of the endangered
   Cantabrian brown bear, and the same dataset of non-invasive samples, we
   evaluated which molecular marker perform better (microsatellites vs.
   SNPs), and whether the selection of the marker could impact on
   estimates. Our results show similar posterior estimates for bear density
   and for the scale parameter, resulting in consistent population
   estimates, around 50 bears, regardless the molecular marker type
   selected, microsatellites: 48.4 (95\% BCI = 33.8-67.3) or SNPs: 52.7
   (95\%BCI = 36.0-74.8). Using our dataset, we provide evidence for the
   importance of running several replicates for both microsatellites and
   SNPs when genotyping non-invasive samples, and how for the same number
   of molecular markers, microsatellites were statistically more powerful.
   The positive trend observed in small large carnivore populations
   requires the adaptation of monitoring approaches. The quality of indexes
   commonly used, such as the minimum annual counts of females with cubs of
   the year in our study case, may be more difficult to maintain over time
   as populations increase in size and range. We therefore recommend the
   implementation of a regular monitoring based on non-invasive DNA
   monitoring and SCR approaches.},

Title = {Conservation of northwest Atlantic harp seals: Past success, future
   uncertainty?},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {192},
Pages = {181-191},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Harp seals require pack ice as a platform for resting, to give birth and
   nurse their young. They are also subject to commercial and subsistence
   harvesting. In the late 1990's there were concerns that the Northwest
   Atlantic population would decline to very low levels unless a management
   system using Potential Biological Removals (PBR) was adopted. Canada
   followed a different approach and high harvests based on an alternative
   management framework continued throughout the next decade. We examined
   the status of the Northwest Atlantic harp seal population using a three
   parameter population model that incorporates information on reproductive
   rates, removals, and ice-related mortality acting on young of the year.
   By 1971, the population had declined to a minimum of 1.1 million animals
   and a quota was introduced, which allowed the population to increase. In
   1996, the quota was raised and harvests increased substantially.
   Population growth continued, even as herd productivity declined. The
   population reached a maximum of 7.8 million animals in 2008 and has
   leveled off at around 7.4 million animals. Climate change is expected to
   result in a decline in the amount of seasonal pack ice in Atlantic
   Canada, which adds uncertainty to the future of this population.
   Although the results presented in this paper focused on how the status
   of this population has evolved over the last 60 years, our integrated
   modeling approach can also be used to examine scenarios that project
   into the future, to test the impacts of various management decisions in
   a changing environment. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Title = {Poaching regulates the legally hunted wolf population in Finland},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {215},
Pages = {11-18},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Poaching may threaten population viability and can occur in both
   non-harvested and legally harvested populations. Telemetry facilitates
   the determination of the fates of individual animals, and the resultant
   mortality scenarios can be used to evaluate the role of poaching in
   population changes. Finland's legally hunted wolf (Canis lupus)
   population fluctuated between 100 and 300 animals during 1998-2016, and
   this cannot be explained by the rates of legal hunting and other known
   mortalities alone. We examined the role of poaching in wolf population
   changes. We created different scenarios based on multi-source
   information on poaching among 130 collared wolves. Poaching has been the
   primary cause of death followed by legal hunting. We calculated the
   survival rate and cause-specific mortality risk; wolves whose fates were
   unknown were censored. As one of the event alternatives (unknown fate or
   known mortality cause), censoring was related to social status; breeding
   adults were more often poached, whereas dispersers were censored. We
   created two sets of scenarios based on the censoring procedure (random
   and non-random), and for both sets, we created 4 scenarios ranging from
   high to no poaching based on decreasing confidence in the data. Annual
   survival ranged from 0.11-0.24 (high poaching scenario) to 0.43-0.60 (no
   poaching); survival dropped in mid-winter. The poaching rate varied
   between years from less than 0.09-0.13 up to 0.31-0.43. We consider
   poaching to be a regulatory factor; it focused on breeding adults and
   seemed to escalate as a response to increased population size. We
   conclude that tolerance for carnivores cannot be promoted by legal
   hunting alone, so more comprehensive conservation efforts are needed.},

Abstract = {Recovering small populations of threatened species is an important
   global conservation strategy. Monitoring the anticipated recovery,
   however, often relies on uncertain abundance indices rather than on
   rigorous demographic estimates. To counter the severe threat from
   poaching of wild tigers (Panthera tigris), the Government of Thailand
   established an intensive patrolling system in 2005 to protect and
   recover its largest source population in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife
   Sanctuary. Concurrently, we assessed the dynamics of this tiger
   population over the next 8 years with rigorous photographic
   capture-recapture methods. From 2006 to 2012, we sampled across 624-1026
   km(2) with 137-200 camera traps. Cameras deployed for 21,359 trap days
   yielded photographic records of 90 distinct individuals. We used closed
   model Bayesian spatial capture-recapture methods to estimate tiger
   abundances annually. Abundance estimates were integrated with
   likelihood-based open model analyses to estimate rates of annual and
   overall rates of survival, recruitment, and changes in abundance.
   Estimates of demographic parameters fluctuated widely: annual density
   ranged from 1.25 to 2.01 tigers/100 km(2), abundance from 35 to 58
   tigers, survival from 79.6\% to 95.5\%, and annual recruitment from 0 to
   25 tigers. The number of distinct individuals photographed demonstrates
   the value of photographic capture-recapture methods for assessments of
   population dynamics in rare and elusive species that are identifiable
   from natural markings. Possibly because of poaching pressure, overall
   tiger densities at Huai Kha Khaeng were 82-90\% lower than in
   ecologically comparable sites in India. However, intensified patrolling
   after 2006 appeared to reduce poaching and was correlated with marginal
   improvement in tiger survival and recruitment. Our results suggest that
   population recovery of low-density tiger populations may be slower than
   anticipated by current global strategies aimed at doubling the number of
   wild tigers in a decade.},

Title = {Risks a la carte: Modelling the occurrence and intensity of wolf
   predation on multiple livestock species},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {228},
Pages = {331-342},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Predation on livestock is a source of human-wildlife conflicts and can
   undermine the conservation of large carnivores. To design effective
   mitigation strategies, it is important to understand the determinants of
   predation across livestock species, which often differ in husbandry
   practices, vulnerability to predators and economic value. Moreover,
   attention should be given to both predation occurrence and intensity,
   because these can have different spatial patterns and predictors. We
   used spatial risk modelling to quantify factors affecting wolf predation
   on five livestock species in Portugal. Within the 1619 parishes
   encompassing the entire wolf range in the country, the national wolf
   compensation scheme recorded 17,670 predation events in 2009-2015, each
   involving one or more livestock species: sheep (31.7\%), cattle
   (27.7\%), goats (26.8\%), horses (14.8\%) and donkeys (3.2\%). Models
   built with 2009-2013 data and validated with 2014-2015 data, showed a
   shared general pattern of predation probability on each species
   increasing with its own density and proximity to wolf packs. For some
   species there were positive relations with the density of other
   livestock species, and with habitat variables such as altitude, and land
   cover by shrubland and natural pastures. There was also a general
   pattern for predation intensity on each species increasing with its own
   density, while proximity to wolf packs had no significant effects.
   Predation intensity on goats, cattle and horses increased with the use
   of communal versus private pastures. Our results suggest that although
   predation may occur wherever wolves coexist with livestock species, high
   predation intensity is mainly restricted to particular areas where
   husbandry practices increase the vulnerability of animals, and this is
   where mitigation efforts should concentrate.},

Title = {Illegal hunting as a major driver of the source-sink dynamics of a
   reintroduced lynx population in Central Europe},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {224},
Pages = {355-365},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Large carnivores, such as wolves and lynx, are strictly protected by law
   in most European countries. However, they are still vulnerable due to
   habitat loss and illegal hunting. The Bohemian Forest Ecosystem lynx
   population is exemplary as a reintroduced carnivore population in
   Central Europe. The population expanded rapidly after the reintroduction
   (phase I) but then declined and stagnated at a low population size
   (phase II). There is some evidence that illegal hunting might have
   caused this development, but reliable data on the intensity of illegal
   hunting is lacking, and hence long-term consequences for the population
   cannot be assessed. We used a spatially explicit individual-based
   dispersal and population model to inversely fit mortality probabilities
   to long-term monitoring data; the model integrated both chance
   observations and telemetry data, and discriminated between baseline
   mortality, road mortality and added unknown mortality. During phase I,
   the estimated added unknown mortality ranged between 3 and 4\%, with an
   extinction rate < 5\%; during phase II, the estimated added unknown
   mortality reached 15-20\%, which would prevent animals from colonizing
   new habitat patches. The probability of extinction in phase II ranged
   between 13 and 74\%, thereby reaching a tipping point at which the
   additional unknown mortality of a few animals could drive the population
   to extinction. However, when we considered the national parks as fully
   protected, the extinction probability dropped to < 1\%. Based on our
   results, we conclude that the added unknown mortality is most likely
   explained by illegal hunting and therefore the highest priority for the
   conservation of the lynx population in the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem
   should be the prevention of illegal hunting in national parks and their
   immediate surroundings.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Some species may have a larger role than others in the transfer of
   complex effects of multiple human stressors, such as changes in biomass,
   through marine food webs. We devised a novel approach to identify such
   species. We constructed annual interaction-effect networks (IENs) of the
   simulated changes in biomass between species of the southeastern
   Australian marine system. Each annual IEN was composed of the species
   linked by either an additive (sum of the individual stressor response),
   synergistic (lower biomass compared with additive effects), or
   antagonistic (greater biomass compared with additive effects) response
   to the interaction effect of ocean warming, ocean acidification, and
   fisheries. Structurally, over the simulation period, the number of
   species and links in the synergistic IENs increased and the network
   structure became more stable. The stability of the antagonistic IENs
   decreased and became more vulnerable to the loss of species. In
   contrast, there was no change in the structural attributes of species
   linked by an additive response. Using indices common in food-web and
   network theory, we identified the species in each IEN for which a change
   in biomass from stressor effects would disproportionately affect the
   biomass of other species via direct and indirect local, intermediate,
   and global predator-prey feeding interactions. Knowing the species that
   transfer the most synergistic or antagonistic responses in a food-web
   may inform conservation under increasing multiple-stressor impacts.},

Title = {Protected area effectiveness in a sea of palm oil: A Sumatran case study},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {234},
Pages = {123-130},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite the establishment of a national protected area system at the
   beginning of the 20th century to protect some of the world's most
   biodiverse forests, Indonesia has one of the highest deforestation rates
   in the world, due in part to the expansion of the global palm oil
   industry. The unique ecosystems of Sumatra, Indonesia provide habitat
   for critically endangered Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae),
   Sumatran elephants (Elephas maximus swnatrensis), and two species of
   orangutans (Pongo abelii and Pongo tapanuliensis). In this study, we use
   a matching method with generalized boosted models to determine the
   effectiveness of three nationally protected areas in preventing
   deforestation from 2002 to 2016. We also examine leakage - an increase
   in deforestation directly outside of protected areas relative to the
   wider landscape - to provide a clearer picture of the effects of
   agricultural expansion in this landscape. We found that Tesso Nilo
   National Park, with its lowland rain forest and conditions suitable for
   oil palm, offered the least protection from deforestation (avoided
   deforestation rate = 4.18\%, p < 0.05 95\% CI {[}1.97\% - 6.45\%]).
   Bukit Tigapuluh National Park, which may experience some de facto
   protection (i.e. protection due to factors independent of policy) with
   its mountainous terrain and difficult access, had the highest avoided
   deforestation rate (26.36\%, p < 0.05 95\% CI {[}24.17-28.55]), but had
   relatively high leakage (10.21\%, p < 0.05 95\% CI {[}7.51-12.98]). The
   low avoided deforestation rate in Tesso Nilo could be due to high
   localized human population and/or other socio-economic factors we were
   unable to control for in this study. The quantitative evidence of
   deforestation and effectiveness of protected areas in this heavily
   modified landscape supports the need for increased enforcement around
   protected areas locally, and globally in other oil palm production
   regions. These actions are critical in the preservation of global,
   tropical endemic flora and fauna.},

Title = {Plant diversity partitioning in grazed Mediterranean grassland at
   multiple spatial and temporal scales},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1260-1268},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1. Grazing by large ungulates may affect plant species richness and
   diversity at multiple spatial and/or temporal scales, because grazing
   affects small-scale resource heterogeneity and plant interactions at the
   local scale, while effects at the landscape scale are related to grazing
   intensity and timing.
   2. We used diversity partitioning to analyse long-and short-term effects
   of cattle grazing on plant species richness and diversity in an
   experimental spatial hierarchy in Mediterranean annual grassland.
   Short-term changes during secondary succession in grazed plots
   (2003-2005) at two grazing intensities (heavy and moderate) were
   analysed and compared with long-term protected vegetation. We applied
   Hill's q-diversity metrics at q = 0 (species richness) and q = 2
   (reciprocal Simpson diversity) to examine the partitioning of species
   richness and diversity between their alpha (alpha) and beta (beta)
   components in the different treatments at four spatial scales: quadrats,
   within exclosures, within plots, within treatments.
   3. At q = 0, alpha-diversity was always significantly lower, and
   beta-diversity significantly higher, than predicted by the randomised
   null model. Diversity partitioning at q = 2 showed a similar trend at
   the quadrat scale. At the exclosure scale, partitioning exhibited a
   similar trend during the first 2 years of secondary succession but did
   not deviate from the null model in the third year, as observed in
   protected vegetation in all years.
   4. At q = 0, diversity decreased across all treatments in the short
   term. At q = 2, diversity was initially higher in grazed plots than in
   protected vegetation; alpha and beta components both decreased during
   secondary succession, to the levels observed in the protected
   vegetation.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Lower dominance in grazed vegetation
   indicates that grazing affects competitive exclusion at the local, small
   scale and accentuates natural heterogeneity (e.g. patchiness of soil
   resources, presence of rocks in the landscape) at a larger scale. The
   results of this study emphasise the importance of grazing as a
   management tool for maintaining plant diversity at multiple scales. This
   is a major concern worldwide, as the area covered by natural ecosystems
   continues to dwindle, necessitating management of grasslands for
   multiple functions such as animal production, resource protection and
   wildlife enhancement.},

Title = {Transition from conventional to light-emitting diode street lighting
   changes activity of urban bats},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Light pollution is rapidly increasing and can have deleterious effects
   on biodiversity, yet light types differ in their effect on wildlife.
   Among the light types used for street lamps, light-emitting diodes
   (LEDs) are expected to become globally predominant within the next few
   years. In a large-scale field experiment, we recorded bat activity at 46
   street lights for 12 nights each and investigated how the widespread
   replacement of conventional illuminants by LEDs affects urban bats: we
   compared bat activity at municipal mercury vapour (MV) street lamps that
   were replaced by LEDs with control sites that were not
   changed.Pipistrellus pipistrellus was the most frequently recorded
   species; it was 45\% less active at LEDs than at MV street lamps, but
   the activity did not depend on illuminance level. Light type did not
   affect the activity of Pipistrellus nathusii, Pipistrellus pygmaeus or
   bats in the Nyctalus/Eptesicus/Vespertilio (NEV) group, yet the activity
   of P.nathusii increased with illuminance level. Bats of the genus Myotis
   increased activity 45-fold at LEDs compared with MV lights, but
   illuminance level had no effect. Decreased activity of P.pipistrellus,
   which are considered light tolerant, probably paralleled insect
   densities around lights. Further, our results suggest that LEDs may be
   less repelling for light-averse Myotis spp. than MV lights. Accordingly,
   the transition from conventional lighting techniques to LEDs may greatly
   alter the anthropogenic impact of artificial light on urban bats and
   might eventually affect the resilience of urban bat
   populations.Synthesis and applications. At light-emitting diodes (LEDs),
   the competitive advantage - the exclusive ability to forage on insect
   aggregations at lights - is reduced for light-tolerant bats. Thus, the
   global spread of LED street lamps might lead to a more natural level of
   competition between light-tolerant and light-averse bats. This effect
   could be reinforced if the potential advantages of LEDs over
   conventional illuminants are applied in practice: choice of spectra with
   relatively little energy in the short wavelength range; reduced
   spillover by precisely directing light; dimming during low human
   activity times; and control by motion sensors. Yet, the potential
   benefits of LEDs could be negated if low costs foster an overall
   increase in artificial lighting.},

Title = {Toward accurate and precise estimates of lion density},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {934-943},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Reliable estimates of animal density are fundamental to understanding
   ecological processes and population dynamics. Furthermore, their
   accuracy is vital to conservation because wildlife authorities rely on
   estimates to make decisions. However, it is notoriously difficult to
   accurately estimate density for wideranging carnivores that occur at low
   densities. In recent years, significant progress has been made in
   density estimation of Asian carnivores, but the methods have not been
   widely adapted to African carnivores, such as lions (Panthera leo).
   Although abundance indices for lions may produce poor inferences, they
   continue to be used to estimate density and inform management and
   policy. We used sighting data from a 3-month survey and adapted a
   Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) model to estimate
   spatial lion density in the Maasai Mara National Reserve and surrounding
   conservancies in Kenya. Our unstructured spatial capture-recapture
   sampling design incorporated search effort to explicitly estimate
   detection probability and density on a fine spatial scale, making our
   approach robust in the context of varying detection probabilities.
   Overall posterior mean lion density was estimated to be 17.08 (posterior
   SD 1.310) lions >1 year old/100 km(2), and the sex ratio was estimated
   at 2.2 females to 1 male. Our modeling framework and narrow posterior SD
   demonstrate that SECR methods can produce statistically rigorous and
   precise estimates of population parameters, and we argue that they
   should be favored over less reliable abundance indices. Furthermore, our
   approach is flexible enough to incorporate different data types, which
   enables robust population estimates over relatively short survey periods
   in a variety of systems. Trend analyses are essential to guide
   conservation decisions but are frequently based on surveys of differing
   reliability. We therefore call for a unified framework to assess lion
   numbers in key populations to improve management and policy decisions.},

Abstract = {Cetaceans are important consumers in marine ecosystems, but few studies
   have quantified their climate responses. The rapid, directional warming
   occurring in the Northeast United States (NEUS) provides a unique
   opportunity to assess climate impacts on cetaceans. We used stranding
   data to examine changes to the distribution and relative abundance of
   odontocetes from 1996 to 2020 in both the NEUS and the Southeast United
   States (SEUS), which is not warming. We conducted simulations to
   determine the number of stranding events needed to detect a
   distributional shift for each species given the speed of the shift and
   the spatial variability in strandings. We compared observed shifts to
   climate velocity. Smaller sample sizes were needed to detect more rapid
   poleward shifts, particularly for species with low spatial variability.
   Poleward shifts were observed in all species with sufficient sample
   sizes, and shifts were faster than predicted by climate velocity. For
   species whose trailing edge of distribution occurred in the NEUS, the
   center of distribution approached the northern limit of the NEUS and
   relative abundance declined through time, suggesting shifts north out of
   US waters. The relative abundance of warm water species in the stranding
   record increased significantly in the NEUS while that of cool water
   species declined significantly as their distributions shifted north out
   of the NEUS. Changes in the odontocete community were less apparent in
   the SEUS, highlighting the importance of regional warming. Observed
   poleward shifts and changes in species composition suggest a
   reorganization of the odontocete community in the NEUS in response to
   rapid warming. We suggest that strandings provide a key dataset for
   understanding climate impacts on cetaceans given limitations of survey
   effort and modeling approaches for predicting distributions under
   rapidly changing conditions. Our findings portend marked changes to the
   distribution of highly mobile consumer species across international
   boundaries under continued warming.},

Title = {Basal tolerance but not plasticity gives invasive springtails the
   advantage in an assemblage setting},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {As global climates change, alien species are anticipated to have a
   growing advantage relative to their indigenous counterparts, mediated
   through consistent trait differences between the groups. These insights
   have largely been developed based on interspecific comparisons using
   multiple species examined from different locations. Whether such
   consistent physiological trait differences are present within
   assemblages is not well understood, especially for animals. Yet, it is
   at the assemblage level that interactions play out. Here, we examine
   whether physiological trait differences observed at the interspecific
   level are also applicable to assemblages. We focus on the Collembola, an
   important component of the soil fauna characterized by invasions
   globally, and five traits related to fitness: critical thermal maximum,
   minimum and range, desiccation resistance and egg development rate. We
   test the predictions that the alien component of a local assemblage has
   greater basal physiological tolerances or higher rates, and more
   pronounced phenotypic plasticity than the indigenous component. Basal
   critical thermal maximum, thermal tolerance range, desiccation
   resistance, optimum temperature for egg development, the rate of
   development at that optimum and the upper temperature limiting egg
   hatching success are all significantly higher, on average, for the alien
   than the indigenous components of the assemblage. Outcomes for critical
   thermal minimum are variable. No significant differences in phenotypic
   plasticity exist between the alien and indigenous components of the
   assemblage. These results are consistent with previous interspecific
   studies investigating basal thermal tolerance limits and development
   rates and their phenotypic plasticity, in arthropods, but are
   inconsistent with results from previous work on desiccation resistance.
   Thus, for the Collembola, the anticipated advantage of alien over
   indigenous species under warming and drying is likely to be manifest in
   local assemblages, globally.},

Title = {Recovery of a threatened seabird after eradication of an introduced
   predator: Eight years of progress for Scripps's murrelet at Anacapa
   Island, California},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {162},
Pages = {52-59},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Eradication of introduced predators has become an increasingly important
   restoration strategy on islands since the 1970s, but the benefits for
   impacted seabird populations are seldom examined. Scripps's murrelet
   (Synthliboramphus scrippsi), a small crevice nesting alcid, suffered
   severe impacts from introduced mammals at all breeding islands through
   much of the 19th and 20th centuries. From 2001 to 2010, nest monitoring
   was conducted to assess responses of the remnant murrelet population at
   Anacapa Island, California after black rats (Rattus rattus) were
   eradicated in 2002. Baseline (2001-2002) and post-eradication
   (2003-2010) monitoring in ten sea caves recorded a nearly 3-fold
   increase in hatching success (30\% versus 85\%), due mainly to a drastic
   reduction in egg predation. Post-eradication monitoring in caves was
   augmented with three plots in previously vacant ``non-cave{''} habitats
   that were occupied within 1-3 years of rat eradication. Nests increased
   10\% per annum in sea caves, 24\% in non-cave plots and 14\% overall.
   Murrelet nesting was limited mostly to remnant breeding habitats,
   consistent with recruitment of philopatric local cohorts as the major
   factor in colony growth. No nests were found during limited searches of
   suitable crevices on upper-island slopes and cliffs. Continued
   monitoring at Anacapa is needed to document the long-term progress and
   rate of colony recovery and detect nesting in currently vacant habitats.
   Better knowledge of the post-eradication responses of seabirds will
   assist development of more effective island restoration actions; thus,
   baseline and post-eradication monitoring should be essential components
   of more eradication programs in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The threat posed by large carnivores to livestock and humans makes
   peaceful coexistence between them difficult. Effective implementation of
   conservation laws and policies depends on the attitudes of local
   residents toward the target species. There are many known correlates of
   human attitudes toward carnivores, but they have only been assessed at
   the scale of the individual. Because human societies are organized
   hierarchically, attitudes are presumably influenced by different factors
   at different scales of social organization, but this scale dependence
   has not been examined. We used structured interview surveys to
   quantitatively assess the attitudes of a Buddhist pastoral community
   toward snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and wolves (Canis lupus). We
   interviewed 381 individuals from 24 villages within 6 study sites across
   the high-elevation Spiti Valley in the Indian Trans-Himalaya. We
   gathered information on key explanatory variables that together captured
   variation in individual and village-level socioeconomic factors. We used
   hierarchical linear models to examine how the effect of these factors on
   human attitudes changed with the scale of analysis from the individual
   to the community. Factors significant at the individual level were
   gender, education, and age of the respondent (for wolves and snow
   leopards), number of income sources in the family (wolves), agricultural
   production, and large-bodied livestock holdings (snow leopards). At the
   community level, the significant factors included the number of
   smaller-bodied herded livestock killed by wolves and mean agricultural
   production (wolves) and village size and large livestock holdings (snow
   leopards). Our results show that scaling up from the individual to
   higher levels of social organization can highlight important factors
   that influence attitudes of people toward wildlife and toward formal
   conservation efforts in general. Such scale-specific information can
   help managers apply conservation measures at appropriate scales. Our
   results reiterate the need for conflict management programs to be
   multipronged. Factores Multi-Escala que Afectan las Actitudes Humanas
   hacia Leopardos de las Nieves y Lobos
   Resumen La amenaza que presentan los grandes carnivoros para el ganado y
   los humanos hace que la coexistencia pacifica entre ellos sea dificil.
   La implementacion efectiva de leyes y politicas de conservacion depende
   de la actitud de los residentes locales hacia la especie determinada.
   Hay muchas correlaciones conocidas de las actitudes humanas hacia los
   carnivoros, pero solo se han evaluado en una escala individual. Ya que
   las sociedades humanas se organizan jerarquicamente, se presume que las
   actitudes estan influenciadas por diferentes factores a diferentes
   escalas de la organizacion social, pero esta dependencia de escalas no
   se ha examinado. Usamos censos de entrevistas estructuradas para evaluar
   cuantitativamente las actitudes de una comunidad pastoral budista hacia
   los leopardos de las nieves (Panthera uncia) y los lobos (Canis lupus).

   explicativas clave que juntas capturaron la variacion en los factores
   socio-economicos individuales y a nivel de aldea. Usamos modelos
   jerarquicos lineales para examinar como el efecto de estos factores
   sobre las actitudes humanas cambio con la escala de analisis de la
   individual a la de comunidad. Los factores significativos al nivel
   individual fueron el genero, la educacion y la edad del respondiente
   (para lobos y leopardos de las nieves), numero de fuentes de ingreso en
   la familia (lobos), produccion agricola y propiedades de ganado de gran
   tamano (leopardos). En el nivel de comunidad, los factores
   significativos incluyeron el numero de ganado de pequeno tamano cazado
   por lobos y la produccion agricola promedio (lobos) y el tamano de la
   aldea y las propiedades de ganado de gran tamano (leopardo). Nuestros
   resultados muestran que aumentar de la escala individual a niveles mas
   altos de la organizacion social puede resaltar factores importantes que
   influyen la actitud de las personas hacia la vida silvestre y en general
   hacia esfuerzos formales por conservarla. Dicha informacion especifica
   de escala puede ayudar a los administradores a aplicar medidas de
   conservacion a escalas apropiadas. Nuestros resultados reiteran la
   necesidad de que los programas de manejo de conflictos sean
   multiaspecto.},

Title = {Perceptions of environmental justice and the conflict surrounding large
   carnivore management in Norway - Implications for conflict management},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {203},
Pages = {197-206},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict is increasingly being recognised as containing
   strong elements of social conflict. The extent to which stakeholders
   regard a management system as being just and fair is a key social
   dimension of conflict. This paper investigates the perceptions of
   justice regarding the carnivore conflict in Norway among sheep farmers,
   environmentalists and indigenous reindeer herders using Qmethodology.
   Three significant perspectives on environmental justice were identified,
   which we labelled the Carnivore Advocates (containing most
   environmentalists), the Carnivore Sceptics (containing most of the sheep
   farmers and reindeer herders) and the Bureaucratic Carnivore Sceptics
   (containing the remaining sheep farmers and a reindeer herder). The
   widest disagreement was over what constitutes environmental harm and
   environmental goods and how the costs and benefits should be
   distributed, indicating that fundamental differences in values and
   perceptions underlie the intractability of this conflict. However, the
   results of this study suggest that the widespread conceptualisation of
   justice as strictly a matter of equitable distribution of costs and
   benefits is incomplete. Recognition justice, in the form of
   acknowledging group identity, lifestyle, knowledge and viewpoints, and
   seeking mutual respect for differences constituted a good in itself for
   all stakeholders. It cannot therefore just be viewed as a means to
   establish equitable distribution of goods and harms. Issues related to
   participatory justice were also identified, but were not attributed
   great importance. These results confirm the common assumption that the
   carnivore conflict in Norway is highly polarised. Because the two poles
   differ fundamentally in their value perceptions regarding carnivores and
   how that relates to their sense of identity, we characterise the
   human-wildlife conflict in Norway as a ``wicked problem{''} where
   decisions regarding the management of carnivores is going to entail
   political prioritisation of one viewpoint over the other. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Madagascar does not have native wild felid species; however, distinct
   populations of free-ranging ``forest cats{''} of unknown species are
   known throughout the island, including at Ankarafantsika National Park,
   Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Makira Natural Park and the Masoala
   peninsula. Malagasy ``forest cats{''} are commonly considered invasive
   lemur predators and competitors with endemic carnivores as well as a
   nuisance exotic species that kill poultry. These cats may be descendants
   of African wildcats, European wildcats and/or domestic cats; however, no
   research on their genetic origin has been published. To determine their
   taxonomic status, genetic data from short tandem repeat markers was
   assessed for three wild-caught ``forest cats{''} from the Beza Mahafaly
   Special Reserve (BMSR) and 27 ``forest cats{''} from Ankarafantsika
   National Park. Bayesian analyses comparing the Malagasy ``forest
   cats{''} to approximately 1900 domestic and wildcat sub-species suggest
   the Malagasy cats are descendents of domestic cats from the Arabian Sea
   region, including the islands of Lamu and Pate, Dubai, Kuwait and Oman.
   Additional genetic influences may descend from India and Pakistan.
   Combined with cultural and historical information, these data suggest
   that these felid populations are likely descendents from cats that
   immigrated to the island on trade ships, particularly along early Arab
   trade routes.},

Abstract = {Coexistence between humans and large carnivores is mediated by diverse
   values and interactions. We focus on four sites in the Cantabrian
   Mountains of Spain with a history of continuous wolf presence to examine
   how perceptions of coexistence vary across contexts. We conducted
   semi-structured and informal interviews with livestock farmers (n =
   271), hunters (n = 157), and local community members (n = 60) to collect
   quantitative and qualitative data on people's experiences of coexistence
   with wolves. We use an environmentality framework to analyse approaches
   to wolf governance across sites and explore how local resource users
   perceive, negotiate, and respond to different governance approaches. Our
   analysis is firstly structured around coexistence subjectivities
   associated with pastoralist and hunter cultures. These encompass
   ambivalent and multi-layered relations founded on notions of reciprocity
   with nature and on resource users' roles as producers and land stewards.
   Secondly, we explore encounters between local cultures, interests, and
   environmental regulations in the context of different site-based
   environmentalities. The framework we adopt enables coexistence to be
   conceived as a space of competing knowledges and practices, arising from
   everyday embodied interactions with wolves and the cultural politics
   through which local communities negotiate different ways of governing,
   knowing, and relating to nature.},

Abstract = {Contiguity of protected areas (PAs) is a critical factor to promote well
   being of the native flora, fauna and life support system to humans. Such
   contiguity cannot be guaranteed without providing a path or `a corridor'
   through forested landscapes that includes natural land cover and
   undisturbed patches. Incidentally, the Himalayan foothills have greater
   pressure on these landscapes due to high human dependence for
   livelihood. This pressure is expected to increase in the coming years
   altering the potential corridors between PAs. The PA managers need
   flexible processing, modeling and decision tools to propose a range of
   acceptable corridors between the PAs and ensure their sustainable
   health. Such flexible tools can be utilized in future to modify for
   taking decision to conserve the patches connecting patches and adapt as
   per changing landscapes. This article describes utility of geospatial
   modeling tools to assess the status of corridors in light of changing
   landscapes between Rajaji and Jim Corbett National Park, the two most
   important PAs in the Himalayan foothills. The work has been carried out
   in four stages, first-using satellite data land use land cover (LULC)
   maps were prepared for year 1990, 2000 and 2005, second-Land Change
   Modeler (LCM) was used for LULC change analysis, third-Multi Layer
   Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) was used to predict the status of LULC
   for 2015 and 2020, and fourth-using temporal morphology of the areas
   behaving both as barrier and easiness, friction surface cost was
   calculated to identify least cost pathways (LCPs)/migratory corridors
   between the PAs. The LULC maps for 1990, 2000 and 2005 were evaluated
   using accuracy assessment (80\%) and Khat statistics (> 0.79). The
   change prediction model was validated by comparing actual LULC of 2005
   with predicted LULC of 2005 and the agreement was 71\%. The LCP has
   shifted with the predicted change in the classes. The corridor has
   shifted by 0.5-3 km towards the south and has come closer to the
   agriculture fields and river channels.},

Abstract = {Seabirds are well monitored and protected at their breeding grounds but
   spend most of their life at sea, where they are less well monitored and
   afforded little protection. In an attempt to address this dichotomy,
   attention has been directed toward establishing a network of marine
   reserves for seabirds, based largely on information from at-sea surveys
   and/or biotelemetry studies. Nevertheless, these approaches are costly,
   are typically only available for a limited number of locations, and not
   suitable for species that have either poor at-sea detectability or are
   unable to carry tracking devices. Here we develop a technique to
   identify important areas for breeding seabirds based on at-sea
   projections from colonies. Synthesising data from colony surveys with
   detailed information on population dynamics, foraging ecology and
   near-colony behaviour, we project colony-specific foraging distributions
   of the Northern gannet (Morus bassanus) at colonies in the UK, Ireland
   and France. We test the ability of our models to identify at-sea
   hotspots through comparison with existing data from biotelemetry studies
   and at-sea visual surveys. These models show a positive spatial
   correlation with one of the most intensive at-sea seabird survey
   datasets. While there are limitations to estimating at-sea distributions
   of seabirds, implemented appropriately, we propose they could prove
   useful in identifying potential Marine Protected Areas for seabirds.
   Moreover, these models could be developed to suit a range of species or
   whole communities and provide a theoretical framework for the study of
   factors such as colony size regulation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Evaluating the ecological state of Chinese Lake Baiyangdian (BYD) based
   on Ecological Network Analysis},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {127},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Understanding the structure and function of a lake's ecosystem is the
   premise and foundation to implementing ecosystem-based management.
   However, evaluating the status of the ecosystem of a lake as a whole is
   still difficult when it comes to selecting indicators, determining
   standards, and interpretating results. In order to quantify the
   ecosystem status of Lake Baiyangdian (BYD), a holistic food web model
   was built using Ecopath with Ecosim. Eleven Ecological Network Analysis
   indicators classified into three categories (ecological function,
   ecological maturity, and food web structure) were selected according to
   their representativeness and availability. Based on the published
   literature on similar freshwater lakes or reservoirs in the world,
   quantile-based classification criteria are obtained. Furthermore, the
   Analytic Hierarchy Process was employed to assign the weight of an
   indicator according to its importance, sensitivity, and adaptability. An
   integrated evaluation framework was formed after synthesizing the
   evaluation value using a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. It was
   concluded that the ecological state of Lake BYD in 2009-2010 could be
   graded ``Bad{''}, featuring a low-quality mature ecosystem, low trophic
   transfer efficiency, and linear, simple, and fragile connections between
   trophic levels. More specifically, the ``Medium{''} grade
   detritivory:herbivory ratio (D:H), mean trophic level of the catch
   (MTLC), and ``Bad{''} grade of transfer efficiency (TE) indicate that
   the composition of trophic species is unbalanced and the material and
   energy transfer is inefficient. ``Good{''} grades of total primary
   production over biomass (TPP/TB), biomass over total system throughput
   ratio (TB/TST), and relative ascendency (A/C), together with
   ``Median{''} grade of total primary production over total respiration
   ratio (TPP/TR), show characteristics of a mature ecosystem due to a high
   biomass of macrophytes, although here is a ``low quality{''} in terms of
   exergy. In terms of the performance of the food web structure, all
   indicators achieve a ``Bad{''} grade, suggesting a linear, simple, and
   fragile network. According to our modeling results, controlling the
   excessive macrophyte biomass, restoring fish biodiversity, and
   mitigating the pressures of overexploitation are suggested for the
   ecosystem-based management of BYD. This paper provides an integrated
   method to evaluate the ecological state of a shallow lake when its own
   reference state is unavailable.},

Title = {A tale of two cities, with bears: understanding attitudes towards urban

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {The management of black bears (Ursus americanus) in urban and/or exurban
   settings is of growing concern as these mammals, along with coyotes,
   cougars and others, begin to re-colonize areas from which they had been
   extirpated. Urban and exurban landscapes can offer much needed habitat
   to these space-demanding creatures, thereby buffering habitat losses in
   other areas and protecting populations of these species, but only if
   conflicts between these animals and humans can be managed and minimized.
   In the case of urban black bears, they can become quickly labled as a
   ``problem{''} bear if they become too reliant on human garbage or other
   food sources such as fruit trees. A ``problem{''} bear usually becomes a
   dead bear. In collaboration with the Northern Bear Awareness Society in
   Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, UNBC researchers undertook two
   surveys of Prince George over a 3 year period and a companion survey in
   the city of Coquitlam, BC to examine attitudes towards urban bears. The
   research found that residents of both cities, in spite of regular and
   close encounters with black bears, strongly supported the presence and
   preservation of bears within an urban setting, largely due to
   conservation concerns. Both communities were supportive of non-lethal
   control of ``problem bears{''} and supported the use of warnings and
   fines to discourage human behaviors that created human-bear conflicts
   over lethal controls. These findings offer support for municipal
   governments to reconsider approaches to urban bear management.},

Title = {Shale gas development effects on the songbird community in a central
   Appalachian forest},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {201},
Pages = {78-91},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the last decade, unconventional drilling for natural gas from the
   Marcellus-Utica shale has increased exponentially in the central
   Appalachians. This heavily forested region contains important breeding
   habitat for many neotropical migratory songbirds, including several
   species of conservation concern. Our goal'was to examine effects of
   unconventional gas development on forest habitat and breeding songbirds
   at a predominantly forested site from 2008 to 2015. Construction of gas
   well pads and infrastructure (e.g., roads, pipelines) contributed to an
   overall 4.5\% loss in forest cover at the site, a 12.4\% loss in core
   forest, and a 51.7\%,increase in forest edge density. We evaluated the
   relationship between land-cover metrics and species richness within
   three avian guilds: forest interior, early-successional, and
   synanthropic, in addition to abundances of 21 focal species. Land-cover
   impacts were evaluated at two spatial extents: a point-level within
   100-m and 500-m buffers of each avian survey station, and a
   landscape-level across the study area (4326 ha). Although we observed
   variability in species-specific responses, we found distinct trends in
   long-term response among the three avian guilds. Forest-interior guild
   richness declined at all points across the site and at points impacted
   within 100 m by shale gas but did not change at unimpacted points.
   Early-successional and synanthropic guild richness increased at all
   points and at impacted points. Our results suggest that shale gas
   development has the potential to fragment regional forests and alter
   avian communities, and that efforts to minimize new development in core
   forests will reduce negative impacts to forest dependent species. (C)

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Wild carnivores are threatened by human activities, particularly by
   lethal responses to livestock predation. As natural prey populations
   decline, predation of livestock and consumption of discarded livestock
   `waste' (carcasses and body parts) should increase. We investigated
   whether parameters linked to the production of livestock waste affected
   the likelihood of livestock predation. We interviewed 160 households
   near Ruaha National Park in Tanzania to obtain information on
   households, livestock ownership, predation and parameters linked to
   livestock waste production. Our analysis identified parameters that
   affected the likelihood of predation on cattle, sheep and goats. When
   these parameters were controlled for, we found an increased likelihood
   of cattle predation as waste from diseased and slaughtered cattle
   increased. Sheep predation was more likely and cattle predation was less
   likely as sheep deaths from starvation increased. Goat predation was
   more likely in medium-sized than smaller or larger villages, suggesting
   a trade-off to predators between the increasing benefit of more
   livestock waste and the costs of higher human disturbance and
   diminishing natural prey abundance as village size category increased.
   Our findings suggest that improved disposal of livestock waste from
   slaughtered cattle and measures to decrease cattle deaths from disease
   should reduce predation of highly prized cattle.},

Title = {Where to draw the line? Using movement data to inform protected area

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {234},
Pages = {64-71},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are a cornerstone of modern conservation. For PM
   that are established to conserve mobile species, it is important to
   cover all the key areas regularly used by these species. However,
   zonation and boundaries of PM have often been established with limited
   knowledge of animal movements, leaving the effectiveness of some PM
   doubtful. We used radio tracking data to evaluate the extent to which
   two coastal PM in mainland China encompassed the full range of habitats
   used by migratory shorebirds during non-breeding seasons. The core zone
   (highest restriction on human activities) of the Yalu Jiang Estuary
   National Nature Reserve (Liaoning) incorporated only 22 +/- 6\% (n = 34)
   of the diurnal home range (95\% kernel density) of the endangered great
   knots Calidris tenuirostris. In contrast, the core zone of Chongming
   Dongtan (Shanghai) incorporated 73 +/- 24\% (n = 25) of the home range
   of dunlins Calidris alpina. During high tide, great knots in Yalu Jiang
   mostly occurred in the experimental zone (least restriction on human
   activities) or sometimes outside the PA boundary altogether, where the
   birds could face substantial threats. By investigating satellite
   tracking records, consulting published literature, interviewing local
   experts and mapping habitat composition in different coastal PM in
   China, we found that wet artificial supratidal habitats were frequently
   used by migratory shorebirds but the coverage of these habitats in
   coastal PM was low. These PA boundaries and/or zonations should be
   revised to conserve mobile species more effectively. With the increasing
   number of tracking studies, analysing the spatial relationships between
   PM and the movement ranges of mobile species can increasingly inform the
   development of a representative, comprehensive PA network.},

Title = {Predicting the impacts of edge effects in fragmented habitats: Laurance
   and Yensen's core area model revisited},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {155},
Pages = {104-110},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {An accurate estimate of the impact of edge effects is essential for the
   conservation management of threatened species in isolated habitat
   fragments. In a seminal paper, Laurance and Yensen (1991) developed the
   first generalized predictive model estimating the amount of
   edge-affected area and remaining unmodified core area in isolated
   fragments. Despite their conclusion that the core-area model should be
   applicable to all fragments, regardless of size or shape, the model has
   never been validated beyond the limited range of parameters under which
   the model was constructed. Here, we conduct a sensitivity test of the
   core-area model accounting for ecologically-realistic variation in
   fragment Shape Index (SI), and collinearity among shape, area and depth
   of edge influence (DEI). Using well-resolved GIS data for the South
   Island of New Zealand, we find substantial core-area model
   underestimates for large fragments (>10,000 ha) with high SI values
   (>10.0), particularly at high DEI (>100 m). To overcome this we
   reformulate the core-area model with a more accurate shape-specific
   exponent function, and test our new model against Laurance and Yensen's
   core-area model and a null geometric model using an
   independently-derived GIS dataset for the North Island, New Zealand. Our
   new model provides a significantly better fit to the data. We conclude
   that past predictive applications of the core-area model have
   underestimated true core area, and we recommend our simple re-formulated
   model for estimating the degree of population and community responses to
   habitat fragmentation under ecologically-realistic scenarios of high
   patch shape complexity and large spatial extent of edge influence. (C)

Title = {Low sensitiveness of taxonomic distinctness indices to human impacts:
   Evidences across marine benthic organisms and habitat types},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {448-455},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Ecological indicators likely constitute the mainstream tools in
   assessing the quality of aquatic ecosystems as they condense composite
   biological information into single measures, easier to handle for
   environmental managers and more understandable for non-scientific users.
   However, sampling settings can influence the performance of most
   indices, and their use is often constrained to specific habitat types.
   Average taxonomic distinctness (Delta(+)) and variation in taxonomic
   distinctness (Lambda(+)) may represent promising tools in overcoming
   sampling bias, and potentially applicable to a wide range of
   environmental contexts. In marine systems, such metrics showed higher
   sensitivity than classical indices in discriminating among perturbed and
   unperturbed conditions, though a number of studies found Delta(+) and
   Lambda(+) also varying along natural gradients, suggesting a lower
   ability to discern human-driven variations from natural variability than
   what expected. Here, analyzing existing data sets from previous impact
   assessment studies, we test the response of Delta(+) and Lambda(+) in
   detecting the effects of different sources of anthropogenic disturbance
   on marine mollusks and polychaetes from Mediterranean soft sediments and
   hard substrates. Our results showed that neither classical univariate
   analyses on Delta(+) and Lambda(+) values nor their associated
   statistical framework were able to discern among perturbed and
   unperturbed sites, highlighting a low sensitiveness of such metrics in
   detecting assemblage variations related to anthropogenic disturbance.
   Delta(+) and Lambda(+) are based on presence/absence data, and assume
   impacts being likely to induce variations in taxonomic structures of
   assemblages. As a consequence, they could experience reduced
   discrimination power when impacts mostly affect relative abundances of
   organisms rather than assemblage composition, or drive species
   replacement within higher taxa. Our results also showed that habitat
   type could strongly affect taxonomic relatedness of species within
   assemblages, and that this effect can vary among different organisms,
   suggesting that the departures from expectation of Delta(+) and
   Lambda(+) values might not be always univocally attributable to human
   perturbations, since possibly depending on habitat effects. Taxonomic
   distinctness indices can provide useful additional information on
   taxonomic diversity of assemblages, crucial to better address the wide
   concept of biological diversity. However, the effectiveness of such
   measures in disclosing the effects of human disturbance is still
   unclear, requiring further investigations especially on their potential
   application in defining the ecological status of coastal rocky systems.

Title = {Seabird foraging ranges as a preliminary tool for identifying candidate
   Marine Protected Areas},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {156},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {53-61},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {There is a growing need to identify Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) for
   marine species. For seabirds, MPAs include those near breeding colonies,
   offshore foraging areas, inshore habitats for wintering species, and
   migratory bottlenecks. However, frequently there is a lack of readily
   available current and comprehensive data on foraging areas used by
   species from particular colonies. Therefore, representative breeding
   season foraging ranges for each species may be useful alongside other
   datasets for scoping candidate MPAs. We reviewed studies that estimated
   foraging range for 25 species of UK breeding seabirds. For
   representative foraging ranges, we prioritised studies, giving highest
   value to those based on direct tracking of birds (21\%); then those
   involving indirect estimates using flight speeds and time activity
   (12\%) followed by, boat, aerial, and land-based `survey' observations
   (46\%); and finally we gave lowest value to speculative estimates
   (21\%). Highest confidence was placed in the foraging ranges of northern
   gannet (Morus bassanus), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), and
   common guillemot (Uria aalge), and lowest for common gull (Larus canus),
   common eider (Somateria mollissima), Leach's (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) and
   European storm petrels (Hydrobates pelagicus). Both annual and
   colony-specific variation was evident for some species. Manx shearwater
   (Puffinus puffinus), northern gannet, and northern fulmar (Fulmarus
   glacialis), had the largest foraging ranges (maximum ranges >330, 590
   and 580 km, respectively), whereas red-throated diver (Gavia stellata)
   and little tern (Sternula albifrons) had the smallest (maximum ranges 9
   and 11 km, respectively). Representative foraging ranges may be useful
   to suggest likely colony-specific foraging areas, prior to
   habitat-association modelling for defining candidate MPAs. The approach
   here has international applicability, and would help progress towards
   more comprehensive protection of seabird populations. (c) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {Consistency in impact assessments of invasive species is generally high
   and depends on protocols and impact types},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {163-190},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Impact assessments can help prioritising limited resources for invasive
   species management. However, their usefulness to provide information for
   decision-making depends on their repeatability, i.e. the consist-ency of
   the estimated impact. Previous studies have provided important insights
   into the consistency of final scores and rankings. However, due to the
   criteria to summarise protocol responses into one value (e.g. maximum
   score observed) or to categorise those final scores into prioritisation
   levels, the real consistency at the answer level remains poorly
   understood. Here, we fill this gap by quantifying and comparing the
   consistency in the scores of protocol questions with inter-rater
   reliability metrics. We provide an overview of impact assessment
   consistency and the factors altering it, by evaluating 1,742 impact
   assessments of 60 terrestrial, freshwater and marine vertebrates,
   invertebrates and plants conducted with seven protocols ap-plied in
   Europe (EICAT; EPPO; EPPO prioritisation; GABLIS; GB; GISS; and
   Harmonia+). Assessments include questions about diverse impact types:
   environment, biodiversity, native species interactions, hy-bridisation,
   economic losses and human health. Overall, the great majority of
   assessments (67\%) showed high consistency; only a small minority (13\%)
   presented low consistency. Consistency of responses did not depend on
   species identity or the amount of information on their impacts, but
   partly depended on the impact type evaluated and the protocol used,
   probably due to linguistic uncertainties (pseudo-R2 = 0.11 and 0.10,
   respectively). Consistency of responses was highest for questions on
   ecosystem and human health impacts and lowest for questions regarding
   biological interactions amongst alien and native spe-cies. Regarding
   protocols, consistency was highest with Harmonia+ and GISS and lowest
   with EPPO. The presence of few, but very low, consistent assessments
   indicates that there is room for improvement in the repeatability of
   assessments. As no single factor explained largely the variance in
   consistency, low values can rely on multiple factors. We thus endorse
   previous studies calling for diverse and complementary ac-tions, such as
   improving protocols and guidelines or consensus assessment to increase
   impact assessment repeatability. Nevertheless, we conclude that impact
   assessments were generally highly consistent and, therefore, useful in
   helping to prioritise resources against the continued relentless rise of
   invasive species.},

Abstract = {Over the past similar to 40 years, several attempts were made to
   reintroduce Eurasian lynx to suitable habitat within their former
   distribution range in Western Europe. In general, limited numbers of
   individuals have been released to establish new populations. To evaluate
   the effects of reintroductions on the genetic status of lynx populations
   we used 12 microsatellite loci to study lynx populations in the
   Bohemian-Bavarian and Vosges-Palatinian forests. Compared with
   autochthonous lynx populations, these two reintroduced populations
   displayed reduced genetic diversity, particularly the Vosges-Palatinian
   population. Our genetic data provide further evidence to support the
   status of `endangered' and `critically endangered' for the
   Bohemian-Bavarian and Vosges-Palatinian populations, respectively.
   Regarding conservation management, we highlight the need to limit
   poaching, and advocate additional translocations to bolster genetic
   variability.},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Much of the history of the human-shark relationship has been based on
   fear. For centuries, the goal has been to kill sharks that come near
   boats or beaches. Yet, there is a growing trend of more positive
   feelings toward local shark populations. In this article, we demonstrate
   that feelings of pride toward sharks can serve as an opposing force to
   fear, and can moderate the way fear affects support for policies to kill
   sharks. This study reports on two surveys of pride toward sharks from
   Eastern and Western Australia. These highlight a new and emerging story
   for people and sharks. We argue that the combination of shifts in the
   understanding of sharks' motives during human-shark interactions and
   higher levels of pride support a new political dynamic in which the
   public prefers nonlethal responses to shark bites in support of a
   burgeoning ``save the sharks{''} movement.},

   americanus) in southcentral USA},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {214},
Pages = {66-75},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Landscape connectivity is vital for species conservation in
   human-modified landscapes, lessening population declines and genetic
   depression caused by habitat loss and fragmentation. We used concepts
   from electronic circuit theory to identify potential areas for American
   black bears (Ursus americanus) that facilitate connectivity between key
   federally protected areas, determined if black bears used higher quality
   habitat than available, and examined their distribution relative to
   human disturbance. We developed a regional (Mississippi, Louisiana,
   eastern Texas, Arkansas, and Missouri, USA) model estimating landscape
   resistance to movement using GIS-based features considered to affect
   black bear space use: land cover type, distance to major rivers, road
   density, and highway presence. We selected national forests and national
   wildlife refuges as patches among which to model potential movement.
   Using citizen-reported black bear sightings from Mississippi and
   Missouri, we evaluated land cover selection at fine and coarse scales,
   and validated our model comparing current density between bear sightings
   and random locations. Black bear sightings occurred in areas of higher
   current density compared to random locations (p < 0.001), suggesting our
   connectivity model had good performance for characterizing areas bears
   will use at a coarse scale. However, black bears did not always choose
   high quality habitat for movement at a coarse scale, and avoided areas
   of human disturbance at a finer spatial scale. Contiguous forested areas
   outside protected areas and riparian corridors along major rivers were
   identified as most likely to facilitate connectivity. The relative
   importance of protected areas in maintaining regional connectivity was
   influenced by size, location, and amount of forest cover. Highways
   appeared as semi-permeable barriers to movement that intersected several
   connectivity pinch points. Management to maintain or improve
   connectivity in identified high connectivity areas, including forest
   retention, preservation of riparian buffers, and highway mitigation
   techniques at pinch points, may facilitate black bear recolonization and
   aid broader conservation objectives.},

Title = {Variability in the response of amphipods and macroinvertebrate
   assemblage structure to prolonged drought in forested upland streams},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1465-1480},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With climate change set to increase the frequency and severity of
   drought in many parts of the world, there is a need to better understand
   the effects of drying on stream ecosystems. We investigated the
   long-term effects of drought on two amphipod taxa Paramoera fontana
   (Pontogeneiidae) and Austrogammarus australis (Paramelitidae) and
   macroinvertebrate assemblage structure through an analysis of 13 years
   of data collected from four forested stream reaches (Victoria,
   Australia). Abundances of A. australis and P. fontana in the lower reach
   of Lyrebird Creek declined to zero following surficial streambed drying.
   Similar declines in abundances were not observed in Sassafras Creek or
   the two headwater springs, which continued to flow throughout the
   drought. P. fontana was detected again in the lower reach of Lyrebird
   Creek 12 months after the final cease-to-flow, however A. australis
   remained undetected 5 years later, despite an upstream source population
   within 2 km. Both the entire and shredder macroinvertebrate assemblage
   structure in Sassafras Creek and the lower reach of Lyrebird Creek
   shifted significantly pre- and post-surficial streambed drying in the
   lower reach of Lyrebird Creek. Despite signs of recovery following a
   return to more average flows, assemblage composition remained
   considerably different. The substantial differences in the recovery of
   the two species indicates varying resistance and resilience traits. The
   failure of A. australis to recolonize after 5 years indicates an absence
   of any significant resistance or resilience traits. In contrast, the
   rapid re-colonization of P. fontana may indicate poor resistance traits,
   but strong resilience traits. The sensitivity of A. australis to
   cease-to-flow events points to the need to carefully manage water
   extraction to protect this threatened species. The effective management
   of macroinvertebrate assemblages in the face of drought requires a clear
   understanding of their response to drying, the conservation of refugia
   and the minimization of additional stressors which reduce ecosystem
   resilience.},

Title = {Using ecological niche models to infer the distribution and population

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {167},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Knowing the distribution and abundance of species is critical for
   conservation, yet field surveys are often limited in their spatial
   extent. In this study, we use ecological niche models to infer the
   current and future distribution of New Caledonian Parakeets
   (Cyanoramphus saisseti), Horned Parakeets (Eunymphicus cornutus), and
   Ouvea Parakeets (Eunymphicus uvaeensis) in New Caledonia. In addition,
   we present a new method of assessing the population size of each species
   based on the relationship between local abundance and modelled habitat
   suitability. According to our estimates, there are 5708 (5048-6174) New
   Caledonian Parakeets on the main island of New Caledonia, distributed
   over an area of 2783 km(2), of which 1939 km(2) is forested. We estimate
   there to be 8690(7934-9445) Horned Parakeets, and their distribution
   extends over 3482 km(2), including 2162 km(2) of forest. In comparison,
   the Ouvea Parakeet has a very restricted range of 34 km(2) (most of
   which is forested), and a population estimated at 1730 (963-3203)
   individuals. Projections involving simulated climate change suggest that
   populations of New Caledonian Parakeets and Horned Parakeets may recede
   into areas at higher altitudes in the future, primarily along the
   central mountain chain of the mainland. It is difficult to predict how
   the Ouvea Parakeet will respond to the climatic changes forecast for
   Ouvea, as the species is expected to face climatic conditions in the
   future that are different from any of those currently experienced on the
   island. Our research demonstrates that the current reserve system in New
   Caledonia is unlikely to provide sufficient protection for parakeets.
   Hence, we believe that existing Important Bird Areas (IBAs) should be
   evaluated for their current and future potential as reserves. (C) 2013

Title = {Effects of woodland restoration and management on the community of

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {190},
Pages = {154-166},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Restoration of woodlands that have been invaded by exotic plants has
   primarily focused on restoring vegetation structure by removing invaders
   and planting native species that have declined in abundance. Management
   practices to date continue to focus on plant communities, but if
   restoring ecosystem integrity is the goal of restoration, knowledge of
   how the fauna has recovered is essential. We examined the impact of
   vegetation restoration and management on the surface-active arthropod
   community across a spectrum of 22 woodland sites in the greater
   metropolitan Chicago region. Sites were grouped into three categories
   based on existing condition. Invaded sites had never been restored or
   managed ({''}Control{''}, n = 5); had been undergoing restoration for
   3-21 years ({''}Managed-int{''}, n = 12) but were not yet near the
   management goal; or were restored plots (11-21 years of management) that
   land managers identified as representative of their restoration target
   based upon the vegetation present ({''}Managed-REF{''}, n = 5). Each
   site was a one-ha plot containing four pitfall traps used to assess
   activity-densities of 35 taxa of epigeic arthropods. Permutational
   analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and subsequent canonical analysis of
   principal coordinates (CAP) revealed that arthropod community structure
   varied between Control and Managed-REF sites, with the Managed-it sites
   demonstrating convergence toward the Managed-REF. The activity-densities
   of non-native isopods (detritivores) were nearly twice as high in
   Control sites compared to Managed-REF sites, whereas traps in
   Managed-REF sites had four times the number of Collembola (fungivores).
   Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) revealed that invasive woody
   plant cover and rates of uptake of soil P and NO3- by root simulators
   explained over 40\% of the variation in arthropod community structure.
   Our findings suggest that restoration management targeted at the
   vegetation also restores the arthropod community in woodlands to a
   composition that has fewer non-native arthropods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Pages = {158-168},
Abstract = {European researchers from both the natural and social sciences show
   growing interest in studying interactions between society and wildlife.
   A wealth of theoretical frameworks, concepts, and methods are used, but
   an integration of perspectives is lacking. This research note summarizes
   results from two workshops that included 63 delegates from 25 European
   countries, as well as a follow-up survey of 41 respondents. Two main
   theoretical approaches to the study of human-wildlife interactions were
   identified. One approach focuses on the collective societal level
   relying on theories of governance, social representation, deliberative
   procedures, and commons theory. The other approach targets individuals
   or groups, and is based on theories such as the cognitive hierarchy,
   theory of reasoned action, and theory of planned behavior.
   Interdisciplinary collaboration is needed to identify the best options
   for wildlife conservation and management in a more politically
   integrated Europe.},

Journal = {HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE},

Abstract = {State wildlife agencies are increasingly seeking the advice and
   cooperation of wildlife stakeholders, including that of private hunting

   agencies, little is known about the internal social mechanisms that

   these internal group dynamics. This article used egocentric network
   analysis to examine the effect of peer groups on the antlerless harvest
   decisions of individuals in private deer cooperatives. Our primary
   result was that the members of one's egocentric network influence the
   harvest behavior of that individual, providing some evidence for the
   potential of social network theory and analysis to understand and

Title = {Marine ecosystem indicators are sensitive to ecosystem boundaries and
   spatial scale},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {125},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Time series indicators are widely used in ecosystem-based management. A
   suite of indicators is typically calculated for a static region or
   multiple subregions and presented in an ecosystem assessment (EA). These
   are used to guide management decisions or determine environmental
   status. Yet, few studies have examined how the spatial scale of an EA
   influences indicator behavior. We explore this question using the
   Northwest Atlantic continental shelf ecosystem (USA). We systematically
   divided the ecosystem at six spatial scales (31 unique units), covering
   spatial extents from 250,000 km(2) to 20,000 km(2). The same 22
   indicators were calculated for each unit, assessed for trends, and
   evaluated as 31 independent EAs. We found that the detected signals of
   indicator trends depended on the spatial scale at which the ecosystem
   was defined. A single EA for the whole region differed by 23\% (in terms
   of the 22 indicator trend tests) relative to ones for spatially nested
   120,000 km(2) subunits, and by up to 36\% for EAs at smaller scales.
   Indicator trend disagreement occurred because (most common) a localized
   trend was perceived as widespread, (common) a local trend was obscured
   by aggregating data over a large region, or (least common) a local trend
   switched direction when examined at a broader scale. Yet, there was
   variation among indicators in their scale sensitivity related to trophic
   level. Indicators of temperature, chlorophyll-a, and zooplankton were
   spatially coherent: trends portrayed were similar regardless of scale.
   Mid-tmphic level indicators (fish and invertebrates) showed more spatial
   variation in trends. We also compared trend magnitude and indicator
   values to spatial extent and found relationships consistent with scaling
   theory. Indicators at broad scales produced subdued trends and values
   relative to indicators developed at smaller spatial scales, which often
   portrayed `hotspots' of local abundance or strong trend. Our results
   imply that subsequent uses of indicators (e.g., determining
   environmental status, risk assessments, management decisions) are also
   sensitive to ecosystem delineation and scale. We suggest that indicators
   and EAs should be done at multiple spatial scales and complimented with
   spatially explicit analysis to reflect the hierarchical structure of
   ecosystems. One scale is not best, but rather we gain a new level of
   understanding at each scale examined that can contribute to management
   decisions in a multiscale governance framework characterized by goals
   and objectives with relevance at different scales.},

Title = {Distribution and spatial genetic structure of European wildcat in France},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {18-27},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Given the problem of hybridization with domestic cats, there is a
   growing need to identify populations of the European wildcat Felis
   silvestris silvestris in order to protect the genetic integrity of this
   subspecies. In this paper, we use known locations of observations of
   wildcats or recovered carcasses to reassess the distribution of the
   wildcat in France and, in cases where carcasses were collected, we use
   both phenotypic and molecular genetic analyses to distinguish wildcats
   from hybrids with domestic cats. Spatially explicit multivariate
   analysis of wildcat' genotypes was then performed to define genetic
   units. Our study confirms the presence of wildcats in a large area of c.
   155 000 km2, suggestive of a range of expansion, and divided into two
   clearly distinct and unconnected areas the Pyrenees and the
   north-eastern part of France. However, European wildcat populations may
   be decreasing in the French Pyrenees, whereas the north-eastern part
   represents the main area (MA) of wildcat presence. This extension does
   not appear to be primarily due to hybrids, as both wildcats and hybrids
   were located throughout the MA. In addition, we found that genetic
   diversity of wildcats in the MA is remarkably high, suggesting that
   French populations are not threatened by a lack of genetic diversity.
   Furthermore, wildcats of the MA are structured into two genetically
   distinct populations that are contiguous and probably extend into
   Germany to form the largest area of wildcat presence in Europe and an
   area of major interest for their conservation. Our study calls for
   localized examination of the feasibility and usefulness of wildlife
   corridors to enhance connectivity between the different populations,
   thereby allowing sufficient levels of immigration and gene flow within
   the regional meta-population to ensure the long-term viability of these
   populations.},

Title = {Using fisher-contributed secondary fins to fill critical shark-fisheries
   data gaps},

Abstract = {Developing-world shark fisheries are typically not assessed or actively
   managed for sustainability; one fundamental obstacle is the lack of
   species and size-composition catch data. We tested and implemented a new
   and potentially widely applicable approach for collecting these data:
   mandatory submission of low-value secondary fins (anal fins) from landed
   sharks by fishers and use of the fins to reconstruct catch species and
   size. Visual and low-cost genetic identification were used to determine
   species composition, and linear regression was applied to total length
   and anal fin base length for catch-size reconstruction. We tested the
   feasibility of this approach in Belize, first in a local
   proof-of-concept study and then scaling it up to the national level for
   the 2017-2018 shark-fishing season (1,786 fins analyzed). Sixteen
   species occurred in this fishery. The most common were the Caribbean
   reef (Carcharhinus perezi), blacktip (C. limbatus), sharpnose (Atlantic
   {[}Rhizoprionodon terraenovae] and Caribbean {[}R. porosus] considered
   as a group), and bonnethead (Sphyrna cf. tiburo). Sharpnose and
   bonnethead sharks were landed primarily above size at maturity, whereas
   Caribbean reef and blacktip sharks were primarily landed below size at
   maturity. Our approach proved effective in obtaining critical data for
   managing the shark fishery, and we suggest the tools developed as part
   of this program could be exported to other nations in this region and
   applied almost immediately if there were means to communicate with
   fishers and incentivize them to provide anal fins. Outside the tropical
   Western Atlantic, we recommend further investigation of the feasibility
   of sampling of secondary fins, including considerations of time, effort,
   and cost of species identification from these fins, what secondary fin
   type to use, and the means with which to communicate with fishers and
   incentivize participation. This program could be a model for collecting
   urgently needed data for developing-world shark fisheries globally.
   Article impact statement: Shark fins collected from fishers yield data
   critical to shark fisheries management in developing nations.},

Abstract = {Population size of many threatened and endangered species is relatively
   unknown because estimating animal abundance in remote parts of the
   world, without access to aircraft for surveying vast areas, is a
   scientific challenge with few proposed solutions. One option is to
   enlist local community members and train them in data collection for
   large line transect or point count surveys, but financial and sometimes
   technological constraints prevent access to the necessary equipment and
   training for accurately quantifying distance measurements. Such
   measurements are paramount for generating reliable estimates of animal
   density. This problem was overcome in a survey of Asiatic wild ass
   (Equus hemionus) in the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area, Mongolia,
   by converting an inexpensive optical sporting rangefinder into a
   species-specific rangefinder with visual-based categorical labels.
   Accuracy trials concluded 96.86\% of 350 distance measures matched those
   from a laser rangefinder. This simple customized optic subsequently
   allowed for a large group of minimally-trained observers to
   simultaneously record quantitative measures of distance, despite
   language, education, and skill differences among the diverse group. The
   large community-based effort actively engaged local residents in species
   conservation by including them as the foundation for collecting
   scientific data.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {28},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Biological invasions are a major driver of biodiversity loss and
   socioeconomic burden globally. As invasion rates accelerate worldwide,
   understanding past invasion dynamics is essential to inform predictions
   of future invaders and impacts. Owing to a high diversity of pathways
   and current biosecurity gaps, aquatic systems near urban centres are
   especially susceptible to alien species establishments. Here, we
   compiled and compared alien species lists for three different aquatic
   recipient regions spanning the North Atlantic: Chesapeake Bay, Great
   Lakes-St. Lawrence River and North and Baltic Seas. Each system is a
   major trade centre, with a history of invasions, and characterized by a
   strong natural salinity gradient. Our goal was to compare the alien
   species across systems, to test for similarities in the taxonomic
   composition and geographic origin as well as species overlap among the
   three regions. We selected specific macroinvertebrate, algal and fish
   taxa for analysis, to control for uneven taxonomic and biogeographic
   resolution across regions. Cumulatively, we identified 326 individual
   alien species established in these aquatic systems, with the North and
   Baltic Seas most invaded overall (163), followed by Great Lakes-St.
   Lawrence River (84) and Chesapeake Bay (79). Most invasions were from
   Ponto-Caspian, Eurasian, Northwest Pacific, Northwest Atlantic and North
   American origins, and mostly comprised Arthropoda, Chordata, Mollusca
   and Annelida. However, origins and taxonomies differed significantly
   among destinations, with Ponto-Caspian species particularly successful
   invaders to the North and Baltic Seas then Great Lakes-St. Lawrence
   River, but less so to Chesapeake Bay. Nevertheless, approximately
   eight-tenths of invaders established in only one region, indicating
   disparate invasion patterns and a high potential for future aliens to
   accrue from increasingly diverse source pools and pathways. These
   results support biosecurity strategies that consider a broad range of
   geographic origins and taxonomic groups to limit the translocation,
   arrival and spread of alien species worldwide.},

Title = {Altered sediment biota and lagoon habitat carbonate dynamics due to sea
   cucumber bioturbation in a high-pCO(2) environment},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {465-480},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The effects of global change on biological systems and functioning are
   already measurable, but how ecological interactions are being altered is
   poorly understood. Ecosystem resilience is strengthened by ecological
   functionality, which depends on trophic interactions between key species
   and resilience generated through biogenic buffering. Climate-driven
   alterations to coral reef metabolism, structural complexity and
   biodiversity are well documented, but the feedbacks between ocean change
   and trophic interactions of non-coral invertebrates are understudied.
   Sea cucumbers, some of the largest benthic inhabitants of tropical
   lagoon systems, can influence diel changes in reef carbonate dynamics.
   Whether they have the potential to exacerbate or buffer ocean
   acidification over diel cycles depends on their relative production of
   total alkalinity (AT) through the dissolution of ingested calcium
   carbonate (CaCO3) sediments and release of dissolved inorganic carbon
   (CT) through respiration and trophic interactions. In this study, the
   potential for the sea cucumber, Stichopus herrmanni, a beche-de-mer
   (fished) species listed as vulnerable to extinction, to buffer the
   impacts of ocean acidification on reef carbonate chemistry was
   investigated in lagoon sediment mesocosms across diel cycles. Stichopus
   herrmanni directly reduced the abundance of meiofauna and benthic
   primary producers through its depositfeeding activity under present-day
   and near-future pCO(2). These changes in benthic community structure, as
   well as AT (sediment dissolution) and CT (respiration) production by S.
   herrmanni, played a significant role in modifying seawater carbonate
   dynamics night and day. This previously unappreciated role of tropical
   sea cucumbers, in support of ecosystem resilience in the face of global
   change, is an important consideration with respect to the beche-de-mer
   trade to ensure sea cucumber populations are sustained in a future
   ocean.},

Abstract = {A simple and reliable molecular assay to identify sex would be valuable
   for the management and conservation of critically endangered species
   such as the antelope Saiga tatarica. To this end, we developed a duplex
   PCR system to co-amplify the SRY-related HMG box and the ZFX/ZFY genes
   in a single reaction. The amplification of HMG-box produced a 162 bp
   amplicon for the male sagas, and none for the female. In contrast,
   amplification of ZFX/ZFY genes resulted in 739 and 854 bp amplicons for
   the male and a single 854 bp amplicon for the female. Thus, the duplex
   PCR assay produced three amplicons for male sagas and one for the
   female. Blind testing further demonstrated the reliability of this assay
   system, which could also be used for the sex determination of other
   herbivores, including buffalo and sheep.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Tanzania, arguably mainland Africa's most important nation for
   conservation, is losing habitat and natural resources rapidly. Moving
   away from a charcoal energy base and developing sustainable finance
   mechanisms for natural forests are critical to slowing persistent
   deforestation. Addressing governance and capacity deficits, including
   law enforcement, technical skills, and funding, across parts of the
   wildlife sector are key to effective wildlife protection. These changes
   could occur in tandem with bringing new models of natural resource
   management into play that include capacity building, corporate payment
   for ecosystem services, empowering nongovernmental organizations in law
   enforcement, greater private-sector involvement, and novel community
   conservation strategies. The future of Tanzania's wildlife looks
   uncertainas epitomized by the current elephant crisisunless the country
   confronts issues of governance, embraces innovation, and fosters greater
   collaboration with the international community.

Abstract = {During the IPY-CAML TAN0802 survey with RV Tangaroa, marine communities
   on the shelf and slope of the Ross Sea, as well as around the remote
   Scott Island and seamounts east of the Balleny Islands, were sampled
   using various sampling gears (epibenthic sled, rough-bottom fish trawl,
   beam trawl and multicorer). Amongst the numerous benthic samples
   obtained, an important collection of hydroids was present. Thirty-five
   species, including Sertularella pseudovervoorti sp. nov., have been
   recorded. Anthoathecata are represented only by Bouillonia denhartogi.
   The collection is essentially dominated by Leptothecata, with 34
   species, belonging to the families Lafoeidae, Haleciidae,
   Kirchenpaueriidae, Schizotrichidae, Sertularellidae, Staurothecidae,
   Symplectoscyphidae, Tiarannidae and Zygophylacidae. Symplectoscyphidae
   is by far the most diversified family with 12 species (34\%), followed
   by Kirchenpaueriidae and Staurothecidae with 5 each (14\%) and
   Haleciidae with 4 species (11\%). At the generic level, Symplectoscyphus
   with seven species, Antarctoscyphus, Oswaldella and Staurotheca with
   five species and Halecium with four are the most speciose genera.
   Symplectoscyphus frondosus is clearly the species with the highest
   occurrence. The depth range of 15 species is increased, considerably in
   most cases. Several species so far considered to be inhabitants of the
   Antarctic shelf clearly extend their distribution to the slope. Twenty
   species were found on the shelf and slope of the Ross Sea, with
   Stegopoma plicatile representing the new single record for the area,
   raising the number of known species to 78. Ten species (including the
   new species) come from the virtually unknown area of Scott Island, 8
   constituting new records, raising the number of species known in this
   isolated area to 11. Sixty-eight percent of the species are Antarctic
   endemic and 94\% are restricted to Antarctic or Antarctic/sub-Antarctic
   waters.},

Abstract = {Development of roads through protected areas can have deleterious
   effects on natural habitats containing species of conservation concern.
   During the past decades road construction has affected many former
   remote areas and led to fragmentation and isolation of wildlife
   populations. The present study focuses on the ecological impacts of
   Isfahan's West Freeway, which passes through Ghamishloo Wildlife Refuge;
   an IUCN category IV protected area, in Isfahan Province. The two key
   affected species, both classified as vulnerable by IUCN, the goitered
   gazelle (Gazelle subgutturosa subgutturosa) and the wild sheep (Ovis
   orientalis isphahanica) were subject to impact analyses. We used habitat
   evaluation procedure (HEP) as a habitat-based impact assessment
   methodology which considers habitat quality and quantity. Habitat
   quality was measured as habitat suitability index (HSI) for each
   species. By literature review and field observations, five variables
   defining habitat suitability were identified and suitability maps for
   both species generated. Habitat units (HUs) were derived from
   multiplying the HSI for each species by the habitat area before and
   after freeway construction. The results showed that due to the
   construction of the freeway, about 14\% of the HUs for goitered gazelle
   and about 9\% of the HUs for wild sheep were lost. In addition, for
   quantifying landscape pattern change due to freeway construction,
   various landscape metrics were calculated for the species distribution
   polygons for two times before and after freeway construction. Results
   obtained through quantifying landscape metrics showed that mean nearest
   neighbor (MNN) and number of patches (NP) metrics increased. On the
   other hand, CONTAG metric decreased in both goitered gazelle and wild
   sheep distribution polygons, demonstrating the negative effect of
   freeway on these species distribution polygons integrity. According to
   the results of this study, mitigation and compensation activities should
   be considered in Ghamishloo Wildlife Refuge. Our study demonstrated that
   HEP method combined with quantifying landscape metrics might provide a
   powerful tool for assessing ecological impact of technical
   infrastructures on populations of far-ranging species of conservation
   concern. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Recreational hunting is facing a number of challenges in the
   twenty-first century. In this essay, I maintain the inability of hunters
   to find a good quality place to hunt is the most serious impediment to
   sport hunting in the Western United States, especially for big game
   species. Securing access to privately owned land can be difficult, while
   public land generally provides unlimited access. Issues that hunters
   experience with inaccessible private land as well as public land that is
   overrun with hunters are highlighted. If hunters are unable to have good
   hunting opportunities in terms of both land access and wildlife
   availability, decreased participation is inevitable. Several
   alternatives are identified that could improve the hunting experience
   and keep hunters interested in the activity.},

Abstract = {The mitigation of the impact caused by introduced mammalian predators is
   a priority for conservation managers. Reducing predator population
   numbers is the most realistic strategy in mainland areas or large
   islands, and could be a feasible alternative to pest eradication.
   However, the success of control campaigns depends not only on removal of
   resident individuals, but also on managing reinvasions facilitated by
   connectivity with surrounding source populations. We combined niche
   analysis and fine-scale movement analyses of feral cats (Felis
   silvestris catus) to identify least-cost corridors from sources
   surrounding controlled areas of the ecologically sensitive area of
   Tasman Valley and Aoraki/Mt. Cook National Park, New Zealand. Intensive
   control of exotic predators has been executed during the last ten years
   in this area, where they pose a threat to native species such as
   endangered ground-nesting birds. Species distribution models revealed
   that cat distribution in the region was limited by its main prey, the
   European rabbit, and to mid-elevation (similar to 1600 m) areas. Using
   GPS-tracking data and step-selection functions, we found that cats moved
   in an optimized fashion suggesting a maximum energy gain associated with
   high rabbit presence, while avoiding landscape obstacles such as rugged
   terrain. Connectivity between the high probability of cat presence in
   source and destination locations (in the control area) was facilitated
   by 1-3 corridors between valleys and multiple paths within valleys.
   Identification of least-cost paths, rooted in ecological and behavioral
   mechanisms underlying space use, can identify realistic putative
   corridors for focused implementation of control measures for introduced
   species in ecologically sensitive areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Despite the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
   (CITES) 1989 ban on trading ivory internationally, poaching for ivory
   has intensified in both Africa and Asia. Populations of African elephant
   (Loxodonta spp.) and Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) have declined
   drastically. In response to the rapid decline, the USA and some other
   CITES countries have banned commercial ivory trading in ivory. The
   country with the highest ivory consumption, the People's Republic of
   China, recently shut down its legal ivory trade at the end of 2017.
   Nepal has turned the tide of elephant poaching, with no loss of
   elephants in the last 4 years. This remarkable success has been achieved
   by imposing a total ban on trade in ivory, supported by strict national
   legislation that includes significant fines and incarceration for
   poachers, traders and officials. Elsewhere, elephant poaching continues
   to increase despite the numerous disincentives already in place. Thus,
   we propose a global ban on trade in ivory as the only realistic solution
   to the current unsustainable rate of loss of elephants. The ban should
   be extended to trade in all products from endangered wildlife.},

   in individual-based models of populations},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {The standard dynamic energy budget model is widely used to describe the
   physiology of individual animals. It assumes that assimilation rate
   scales with body surface area, whereas maintenance rate scales with body
   volume. When the model is used as the building block of a population
   model, only limited dynamical behaviour, the so-called juvenile-driven
   cycles, emerges. The reason is that in the model juveniles are
   competitively superior over adults, because juveniles have a higher
   surface area-to-volume ratio. Maintenance requirements for adults are
   therefore relatively large, and a reduced assimilation rate as a result
   of lowered food levels will easily become insufficient. Here, an
   alternative dynamic energy budget model is introduced that gives rise to
   adult-driven cycles, which may be closer to what is often observed in
   reality. However, this comes at the price of a rather odd description of
   the individual, in that maintenance scales with body area and
   assimilation rate with body volume, resulting in unbounded exponential
   body growth. I make a plea to solve the paradox and come up with
   reliable descriptions at both the individual and the population level.},

Title = {Poaching is directly and indirectly driving the decline of South

Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {151-163},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Large herbivores, particularly in water limited systems, are vulnerable
   to the impacts of poaching (illegal hunting) and human-induced climate
   changes. However, we have little understanding of how these processes
   can reshape their populations. With some rapidly declining populations
   there is a need to understand the effects of these stressors on
   populations of vulnerable large herbivores like the white rhino
   (Ceratotherium simum simum). We developed age-structured models for the
   rhino population in Kruger National Park, home to 49\% of South Africa's
   rhinos. We wanted to determine the relative influence of poaching and
   climate on the current and future population size and demographics,
   examine the potential of a dependency effect (the loss of calves from
   poached females) and quantify the compound effect (loss of future
   young). Our results indicated that population declines were largely
   driven by poaching and included a dependency effect. Rainfall had a
   measurable but smaller influence on rhino populations and had an
   additive effect; reduced rainfall exacerbated poaching losses. Current
   poaching levels have resulted in a reduction to the lifetime
   reproductive output per cow from approximately 6 to 0.7 calves: a
   compound effect of 5.3 future offspring. Under current levels of
   poaching, we project a 35\% decline in the Kruger rhino population in
   the next 10 years. However, if poaching intensity is cut in half, we
   project a doubling of the current population over the same time frame.
   Overall, our models showed little sensitivity to demographic and
   environmental parameters, except for adult survival. Our results suggest
   that maintaining and improving the lifetime reproductive output of rhino
   cows should thus be the highest management priority and that new
   management targets should consider both the dependency and compound
   effects associated with poaching on rhino cows.},

Title = {Twenty years of SpayVac (R) research: potential implications for

Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {There are currently >75,000 feral horses (Equus ferus caballus) and
   burros (E. asinus) on U.S. public lands, yet the Appropriate Management
   Level (AML) is set at just under 27,000. Wildlife managers, conservation
   biologists, and livestock ranchers are concerned about the impacts that
   these free-ranging horses have on shared rangelands. Immunocontraceptive
   vaccines may have the greatest potential to regulate horse population
   numbers once AML is reached; however, the vaccine must have multi-year
   efficacy to be both technically feasible and cost-effective.
   Immunocontraception based on porcine zona pellucida (PZP)-specific
   antigens is highly tissue-specific, targeting the ova, and blocking
   sperm binding through antibody occupation of ZP receptors on the ova.
   ZonaStat-H and PZP-22 are PZP-based vaccines; however, their
   contraceptive efficacy does not last long enough to meet management
   needs. SpayVac (R) achieves multi-year efficacy with a single dose,
   without boosters, because the PZP antigens are encapsulated within
   liposomes (multi-layered, submicroscopic vesicles), which gradually
   release PZP glycoproteins to antigen-presenting cells over an extended
   period of time. We review results from SpayVac trials in horses and
   other species to deepen our understanding of how the vaccine works and
   how it may best be applied to regulate free-ranging horse populations at
   AML. We examine 3 studies in horses, which used different SpayVac
   formulations and delivery methods, to learn more about the relationship
   between antibody titers and contraceptive efficacy, as well as potential
   mechanisms of action (e.g., preferential stimulation of IgG4/7 antibody
   isotypes). Additional research to explore possible effects of injection
   site location, antigen purity, role of PZP antibodies, and different
   formulations (e.g., dose, adjuvant) is needed for efficacious
   application to free-ranging herds.},

Abstract = {The quality of habitat for a given species is fundamental to its

   Our efforts focused on a persistent C. irus colony in northeastern
   Florida, resulting in a geographically referenced census of larval
   host-plant Lupinus perennis, along with a multiple year survey of
   microhabitat features relevant to both C. irus adults and immatures.
   Results of the larval host-plant census revealed that the highest
   densities of host plants were located distant to the highest densities
   of C. irus. Hot-spot analysis confirmed the significance of this
   pattern, suggesting different habitat requirements for larval host-plant
   L. perennis and C. irus individuals in order to achieve maximum
   potential densities. Our survey of C. irus immatures showed a similar
   pattern of microhabitat affinity that was previously recorded in the
   Northeast and Midwestern US, including large larval host-plants, low
   amounts of ground cover vegetation, and the presence of some shade.
   Unique to our study we found that the presence of other herbivores of L.
   perennis such as larvae of the crambid moth Uresiphita reversalis had a
   negative effect on encountering C. irus immatures. Our results suggest
   that management that aims to conserve these species needs to include
   habitat factors that favor the overlap of these species and to consider
   where their densities are the highest.},

Title = {Using qualitative methods to support recovery of endangered species: The
   case of red-cockaded woodpecker foraging habitat},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Meta-analyses are powerful tools for synthesizing wildlife-habitat
   relationships, but small sample sizes and complex species-habitat
   relationships often preclude correlative meta-analyses on endangered
   species. In this study, we demonstrate qualitative comparative analysis
   (QCA) as a tool that can reliably synthesize habitat-fitness
   relationships from small sample sizes for species with narrow habitat
   requirements. We apply QCA to results from a habitat threshold
   regression tree model and identify habitat thresholds with consistent
   positive effects on fitness of the federally endangered red-cockaded
   woodpecker (Dryobates borealis; RCW) on the Savannah River Site, USA. We
   reformulated regression tree results in a QCA framework to examine the
   consistency of threshold effects on RCW fledgling production at the
   individual group level (n = 47). Synthesizing regression tree results
   with QCA revealed alternative combinations of habitat thresholds that in
   conjunction with group size consistently led to above-average fledgling
   production for 41 of 47 (88\%) individual RCW groups. Importantly, QCA
   identified unique combinations of habitat thresholds and group size
   related to above-average fledgling production that were not retained in
   the regression tree model due to small sample sizes. Synthesizing a
   small habitat-fitness dataset using QCA provided a tractable method to
   identify unique combinations of habitat and group size conditions that
   are consistently important to individual fitness, but may not be
   detected by meta-analyses that can be biased by small sample sizes. QCA
   offers a viable approach for synthesis of habitat-fitness relationships
   and can be extended to address many complex issues in endangered species
   recovery when correlative meta-analyses are not possible. (C) 2019

Title = {European human-dominated landscapes provide ample space for the

Abstract = {Europe is currently being re-colonized by large carnivore species such
   as brown bear Ursus arctos, Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx and grey wolf Canis
   lupus. Approximately one-third of Europe currently hosts at least one of
   these large carnivore species: they show permanent occurrence in some
   regions and sporadic occurrence without reproduction in others. We
   investigated potential future range expansions of these three large
   carnivores using three different analyses. First, we compared niche
   overlap between the historical, current permanent and current sporadic
   occurrences using n-dimensional hypervolumes. Second, we identified the
   environmental variables that best explain differences between current
   sporadic and permanent occurrences through multi-model inference. Third,
   we projected permanent occurrences into the future across a range of
   land-use change scenarios. We also determined future refuges (i.e.
   sub-optimal habitat in the environmental model, good habitat in the
   human disturbance model) and ecological traps (i.e. good habitat in the
   environmental model, sub-optimal habitat in the human disturbance
   model). In the three large carnivore species, ecological niche overlap
   was higher between historical and current permanent occurrences than
   between historical and current sporadic occurrences, and we also found
   low ecological niche overlap between current permanent and sporadic
   occurrences. Between 20 and 24\% (corresponding to 86 800 to 173 200
   km(2)) of the current sporadic occurrences could result in permanent
   settlement of large carnivores in the year 2040, while 17-24\%
   (corresponding to 122 200 to 104 100 km(2)) and 2.7-4.6\% (corresponding
   to 11 800 to 28 400 km(2)) of the current sporadic occurrences are
   likely to become refuges and ecological traps, respectively. Factors
   affecting range expansion are human activities, which were negatively
   related to permanent occurrences of all three species. In light of our
   results, human-dominated European landscapes provide ample space for the
   future recolonization of large carnivores.},

Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {237-248},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding how environmental factors interact to determine the
   abundance and distribution of animals is a primary goal of ecology, and
   fundamental to the conservation of wildlife populations. Studies of
   these relationships, however, often assume static environmental
   conditions, and rarely consider effects of competition with ecologically
   similar species. In many parts of their shared ranges, grizzly bears
   Ursus arctos and American black bears U. americanus have nearly complete
   dietary overlap and share similar life history traits. We therefore
   tested the hypothesis that density patterns of both bear species would
   reflect seasonal variation in available resources, with areas of higher
   primary productivity supporting higher densities of both species. We
   also hypothesized that interspecific competition would influence
   seasonal density patterns. Specifically, we predicted that grizzly bear
   density would be locally reduced due to the ability of black bears to
   more efficiently exploit patchy food resources such as seasonally
   abundant fruits. To test our hypotheses, we used detections of 309
   grizzly and 597 black bears from two independent genetic sampling
   methods in spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models. Our
   results suggest grizzly bear density was lower in areas of high black
   bear density during spring and summer, although intraspecific densities
   were also important, particularly during the breeding season. Black
   bears had lower densities in areas of high grizzly bear density in
   spring; however, density of black bears in early and late summer was
   best explained by primary productivity. Our results are consistent with
   the hypothesis that smaller-bodied, more abundant black bears may
   influence the density patterns of behaviorally-dominant grizzly bears
   through exploitative competition. We also suggest that seasonal
   variation in resource availability be considered in efforts to relate
   environmental conditions to animal density.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Conflicts with wild animals are increasing as human populations grow and
   related anthropogenic activities encroach into wildlife habitats. A good
   example of this situation is the increase in conflicts between humans
   and sloth bears (Melursus ursinus) in India. Sloth bears are known for
   their aggressive and unpredictable behavior. More human fatalities and
   injuries have been attributed to sloth bear attacks than all recorded
   incidences of wildlife attacks in Buldhana Forest Division of
   Maharashtra, India. We interviewed 51 victims that were attacked by
   sloth bears between 2009-2017 to better understand the reasons for the
   attacks. Thirty-four of the attacks (66.7\%) resulted in serious
   injuries, and there were 7 human mortalities (13.7\%) reported. Most
   attacks occurred close to agricultural fields (66.7\%) and during midday
   (1100-1400 hours). More attacks (64.7\%) occurred when a person was
   working or resting in the field, or retrieving water for the field
   followed by attacks while watching over grazing livestock (13.7\%).
   Individuals aged 31 to 40 years (35.3\%) were the most common victims of
   sloth bear attacks. Half of the attacks were during monsoon season (July
   to October, 51\%) followed by summer (March to June, 35\%) and winter
   (November to February, 14\%). In 39\% of cases, a single bear was
   involved while females with 2 cubs were found to be involved in 37\% of
   attacks. This research was incorporated into a comprehensive conflict
   mitigation plan, which included field staff training for monitoring
   sloth bear population, formulation of a Rapid Rescue Unit to manage
   conflict situations, and sloth bear education programs in the high
   conflict villages. People were made aware of the behavior and activity
   pattern of sloth bears and preventive measures to mitigate potential
   conflicts.},

Title = {A Comparison of Four Survey Methods for Detecting Fox Squirrels in the
   Southeastern United States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-106},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Fox squirrel Sciurus niger populations in the southeastern United States
   appear to have declined, and 3 (S. n. cinereus, S. n. shermani, and S.
   n. avicennia) of the 10 subspecies are currently listed with a
   conservation status of protection. Efforts to conserve and manage fox
   squirrels in the southeastern United States are constrained by
   difficulties in studying their populations because of low densities and
   low detectability. There is a need for an effective survey method to
   fill knowledge gaps on southeastern fox squirrel ecology. To address
   this need and to identify a cost-effective and reliable technique to
   survey and monitor southeastern fox squirrel populations, we compared
   four survey methods across seasons: live-trapping; camera-trapping;
   point counts; and line-transect surveys, in regard to whether a
   detection occurred at a survey point, the total number of detections at
   a survey point, and the total cost for each method. We assessed the
   effectiveness of capture and detection methods and the influence of
   seasonality using generalized linear mixed models. We found
   camera-trapping to be the most effective survey method for assessing the
   presence and distribution of southeastern fox squirrels. In total,
   camera-traps produced significantly more detections (n = 223) of fox
   squirrels than all other methods combined (n = 84), with most detections
   occurring in spring (n = 97) and the fewest in the autumn (n = 60).
   Furthermore, we detected fox squirrels at more survey points with
   camera-traps (73\%) than all other methods (63\%), and we identified
   16\% more individuals from camera-trap photographs than live-trapped. We
   recommend future monitoring of southeastern fox squirrels to be
   conducted using camera-trapping during the spring unless handling of
   animals is needed for other research purposes.},

Abstract = {Coastal zones are among the planets most threatened ecosystems and
   effective management of these systems requires spatial tools at
   appropriate spatial scales. Here we apply aerial photography with
   Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to map the cumulative
   anthropogenic footprint of an industry in a spatially defined
   ecologically important region of the British Columbian coast. Resolution
   required for such an analysis was made possible through highly detailed
   aerial photography of the region taken at an elevation of 305 m, at a
   1:3000 scale. The approach applied here was successful in accurately
   detailing the cumulative extent of the anthropogenic activity on the
   foreshore which could have not been achieved at a coarser resolution.
   Such information was then effectively applied to visualize and assess
   the potential impact of an industrial development of the foreshore on
   bird distribution within the spatially identified region. The degree of
   overlap between the anthropogenic footprint and small estuaries within
   the region was also successfully assessed. For ecologically important
   regions such as Marine Protected Areas, and other such designated
   sensitive coastal regions, detailed mapping through aerial photography
   and GIS can aid in first identifying the true extent of an anthropogenic
   activity and then secondly used to link to possible ecological
   consequences. This in turn greatly enhances our ability to best manage
   the region of interest such that conservation priorities can be met.},

Title = {Quantile Equivalence to Evaluate Compliance With Habitat Management
   Objectives},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {169-182},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Equivalence estimated with linear quantile regression was used to
   evaluate compliance with habitat management objectives at Arapaho
   National Wildlife Refuge based on monitoring data collected in upland
   (5,781 ha; n = 511 transects) and riparian and meadow (2,856 ha, n = 389
   transects) habitats from 2005 to 2008. Quantiles were used because the
   management objectives specified proportions of the habitat area that
   needed to comply with vegetation criteria. The linear model was used to
   obtain estimates that were averaged across 4 y. The equivalence testing
   framework allowed us to interpret confidence intervals for estimated
   proportions with respect to intervals of vegetative criteria
   (equivalence regions) in either a liberal, benefit-of-doubt or
   conservative, fail-safe approach associated with minimizing alternative
   risks. Simple Boolean conditional arguments were used to combine the
   quantile equivalence results for individual vegetation components into a
   joint statement for the multivariable management objectives. For
   example, management objective 2A required at least 809 ha of upland
   habitat with a shrub composition >= 0.70 sagebrush (Artemisia spp.),
   20-30\% canopy cover of sagebrush >= 25 cm in height, >= 20\% canopy
   cover of grasses, and >= 10\% canopy cover of forbs on average over 4 y.
   Shrub composition and canopy cover of grass each were readily met on
   >3,000 ha under either conservative or liberal interpretations of
   sampling variability. However, there were only 809-1,214 ha
   (conservative to liberal) with >= 10\% forb canopy cover and 405-1,098
   ha with 20-30\% canopy cover of sagebrush >= 25 cm in height. Only
   91-180 ha of uplands simultaneously met criteria for all four
   components, primarily because canopy cover of sagebrush and forbs was
   inversely related when considered at the spatial scale (30 m) of a
   sample transect. We demonstrate how the quantile equivalence analyses
   also can help refine the numerical specification of habitat objectives
   and explore specification of spatial scales for objectives with respect
   to sampling scales used to evaluate those objectives.},

Abstract = {Grazing can significantly impact spatial heterogeneity and conservation
   value of ecosystems. Earlier work revealed that overgrazing may
   stimulate persistent vegetation collapse in low-productivity
   environments where vegetation survives by concentrating scarce resources
   within its local environment. However, it remains unclear whether grazer
   fluctuations may cause persistent vegetation changes in
   high-productivity systems where dense stands facilitate their own
   survival by hampering grazer access. Here, we experimentally tested how
   the release from grazing by greylag geese (Anser anser) affects spatial
   vegetation structure in a highly productive, brackish marsh in which
   dense reed (Phragmites australis) stands and bare roosting areas
   coexist. Next, we assessed the resilience of the change in vegetation
   patterning by reintroducing the geese after a 2-year exclosure period.
   During herbivore exclusion, vegetation rapidly colonized the bare areas,
   while reintroduction of herbivores generated a clear species-specific
   response. Specifically, the pioneer species, Bolboschoenus maritimus,
   was immediately eradicated, while the dense and high structure of P.
   australis facilitated its own persistence by limiting grazer access.
   Surface accretion (similar to 1 cm/year) during herbivore exclusion
   further amplified this herbivore-inhibiting feedback, because greylag
   geese primarily rely on waterlogged conditions for grubbing. Synthesis
   and applications. Our results indicate that temporary reductions in
   herbivore numbers may induce persistent unfavourable changes in the
   spatial structure of a high-productivity system. It is therefore
   important to first assess whether vegetation changes are naturally
   reversible or persistent. If state shifts are indeed persistent,
   sufficiently high grazer densities must be maintained to warrant the
   favourable heterogeneous system. If changes in vegetation structure
   negatively impact grazer densities, active management such as sod
   cutting or mowing may be required to restore ecosystem structure and
   functions.},

Title = {Seasonal and diel variations in the activity of canopy insect herbivores
   differ between deciduous and evergreen plant species in a tropical dry
   forest},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {This study evaluated whether herbivorous insects can be expected to have
   particular adaptations to withstand the harsh dry season in tropical dry
   forests (TDFs). We specifically investigated a possible escape in space,
   with herbivorous insects moving to the few evergreen trees that occur in
   this ecosystem; and escape in time, with herbivores presenting an
   increased nocturnal rather than diurnal activity during the dry season.
   We determined the variation in the free-feeding herbivorous insects
   (sap-sucking and leaf chewing) between seasons (beginning and middle of
   both rainy and dry seasons), plant phenological groups (deciduous and
   evergreen trees) and diel period (diurnal and nocturnal) in a Brazilian
   TDF. We sampled a total of 5827 insect herbivores in 72
   flight-interception traps. Contrary to our expectations, we found a
   greater herbivore diversity during the dry season, with low species
   overlap among seasons. In the dry season, evergreen trees supported
   greater richness and abundance of herbivores as compared to deciduous
   trees. Insects were also more active at night during the dry season, but
   no diel differences in insect abundance were detected during the rainy
   season. These results indicate that the strategies used by insect
   herbivores to withstand the severe climatic conditions of TDFs during
   the dry season include both small-scale escape in space and time, with
   evergreen trees playing a key role in maintaining resident insect
   herbivore populations in TDFs. Relatively more nocturnal activity during
   the dry season may be related to the avoidance of harsh climatic
   conditions during the day. We suggest that the few evergreen tree
   species occurring in the TDF landscape should be especially targeted for
   protection in this threatened ecosystem, given their importance for
   insect conservation.},

Abstract = {Landscape level species assessments are rarely available to inform
   conservation planning. Recent advances in multi-taxa survey techniques,
   however, have made them more obtainable by improving efficiency of
   collecting species occurrence data and genetic samples. Here, we used a
   multi-taxa survey technique to provide a landscape level portrait of
   fisher (Pekania pennanti) population status in a portion of the northern
   Rockies where the species' history has been heavily influenced by
   humans. From 2010 to 2014 we deployed 497 winter forest carnivore bait
   stations across a 23,000km(2) study area centered on northern Idaho,
   United States. The stations collected remote camera images and hair
   samples for DNA analysis. We used 12 microsatellite loci to identify 58
   individual fisher in the study area. We identified two fisher
   populations for which we estimated effective population size (N-e) and
   genetic neighborhood size (NS). We calculated local genetic diversity
   measures {[}observed (H-o) and expected (He) heterozygosity, allelic
   richness (Ar), fixation index (F-ST), and number of migrants per
   generation (Nm)] and mapped continuous gradients of genetic diversity
   {[}Ar and inbreeding coefficient (F-IS)] across the study area. We
   identified a fisher population in the West Cabinet Mountains {[}N-e of
   26 (15.3-55.5), NS of 50-60] which is effectively isolated from the
   small population we detected in the Saint Joe/Coeur d'Alene Mountains
   {[}N-e of 6.5 (2.7-15), NS of 10-25]. We determined fisher have been
   effectively extirpated from the Selkirk and Purcell mountains and the
   lack of genetic connectivity between the two small remaining populations
   casts doubt on long term viability. Our study suggests northern Rockies
   fisher populations are vulnerable to landscape barriers and successful
   recovery will depend on future management and augmentation. We recommend
   these factors be considered when determining how, and if, species
   recovery should proceed.},

Abstract = {The Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus) is an open-country species breeding
   in the northern United States and Canada, and has likely experienced a
   long-term, range-wide, and substantial decline. However, the cause and
   magnitude of the decline is not well understood. We set forth to address
   the first two of six previously proposed conservation priorities to be
   addressed for this species: (1) better define habitat use and (2)
   improve population monitoring. We recruited 131 volunteers to survey
   over 6.2 million ha within the state of Idaho for Short-eared Owls
   during the 2015 breeding season. We surveyed 75 transects, 71 of which
   were surveyed twice, and detected Short-eared Owls on 27 transects. We
   performed multiscale occupancy modeling to identify habitat
   associations, and performed multiscale abundance modeling to generate a
   state-wide population estimate. Our results suggest that within the
   state of Idaho, Short-eared Owls are more often found in areas with
   marshland or riparian habitat or areas with greater amounts of sagebrush
   habitat at the 1750 ha transect scale. At the 50 ha point scale,
   Short-eared Owls tend to associate positively with fallow and bare dirt
   agricultural land and negatively with grassland. Cropland was not chosen
   at the broader transect scale suggesting that Short-eared Owls may
   prefer more heterogeneous landscapes. On the surface our results may
   seem contradictory to the presumed land use by a ``grassland{''}
   species; however, the grasslands of the Intermountain West, consisting
   largely of invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), lack the complex
   structure shown to be preferred by these owls. We suggest the local
   adaptation to agriculture represents the next best habitat to their
   historical native habitat preferences. Regardless, we have confirmed
   regional differences that should be considered in conservation planning
   for this species. Last, our results demonstrate the feasibility,
   efficiency, and effectiveness of utilizing public participation in
   scientific research to achieve a robust sampling methodology across the
   broad geography of the Intermountain West.},

Title = {Reference group influences and campaign exposure effects on rhino horn
   demand: Qualitative insights from Vietnam},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Pages = {923-939},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. While considerable effort is invested in rhino horn demand reduction
   campaigns, it is unclear to what extent users are exposed to and accept
   the messages in these ads.
   2. We investigate recall as an indicator of exposure and the influence
   of different reference groups by conducting 50 semi-structured
   interviews with self-reported rhino horn users in Hanoi using an
   interpretative thematic analysis.
   3. The decision to buy or use rhino horn was almost exclusively
   influenced by peers with perceived expertise using rhino horn, whereas
   commonly used deliverers of such campaigns-traditional medicine
   practitioners, doctors, government officials, business leaders and
   celebrities-had very little influence.
   4. Campaign exposure was relatively high, but campaign influence low as
   consumers considered recent demand reduction campaigns and the reference
   groups delivering the message as well as the implementing organizations
   unreliable and driven by profit.
   5. Willingness to sign a pledge to refrain from buying, using or gifting
   rhino horn encouraged by employers or association was relatively high.
   However, the majority of respondents stated they would not comply with
   this pledge.
   6. Case studies of users or their next of kin having experienced
   negative or no effect of rhino horn were suggested possibly effective in
   reducing demand by consumers themselves.
   7. To increase the acceptance of demand reduction campaigns,
   organizations could consider forgoing their own branding to reduce
   distrust in the target audience.
   8. We highlight the importance of conducting formative research using
   both quantitative and qualitative methods based on interviews with
   actual rhino horn users. While qualitative studies of motivations by
   confirmed users entail the risk that they retrospectively explain
   motivations in order to appear internally consistent with their usage of
   the product, it provides valuable insight into their self-image and
   thereby options for affecting their behaviour.},

Title = {Aboveground biomass of naturally regenerated and replanted semi-tropical
   shrublands derived from aerial imagery},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {145-156},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Rapid assessment of plant size and population densities is important for
   estimating biomass over large areas, but it has often been limited by
   methods requiring intensive labor and resources. In this study, we
   demonstrate how shrub biomass can be estimated from fine-grained aerial
   photographs for a large area (23,000 ha) located in the Lower Rio Grande
   Valley, Texas, USA. Over the past 30 years, refuge land management has
   included the replanting of native shrubs to promote the restoration of
   wildlife habitat and carbon sequestration. To assess shrub regrowth, we
   developed a method to estimate individual shrub canopy areas from
   digital aerial imagery that was used to calculate biomass from
   allometric equations. The accuracy of the automated delineation of
   individual canopies was 79 \% when compared to that of hand-digitized
   shrub canopies. When applied to photographs across the refuge, we found
   higher shrub densities for older naturally regenerated sites (174
   individuals ha(-1)) compared to those of younger replanted sites (156
   individuals ha(-1)). In contrast, naturally regenerated sites had less
   biomass (3.43 Mg ha(-1)) than replanted sites (4.78 Mg ha(-1))
   indicating that shrubland restored for habitat conservation has the
   potential to sequester more carbon in a shorter period. There was an
   inverse relationship between aridity and aboveground shrub biomass for
   replanted sites in the drier west (p < 0.05). We found a difference in
   predicted biomass among shrub species in replanted sites that was also
   associated with climate (p < 0.05). We conclude that the canopy of
   individual shrubs detected from remote sensing can be used to estimate
   and monitor vegetation biomass over large areas across environmental
   gradients.},

Title = {The Relationship between Population Density and Body Size of the Giant

   Species of Freshwater Crab from Northeastern Thailand (Potamoidea:
   Potamidae)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},

Abstract = {The giant mountain crab (Indochinamon bhumibol) is endemic to Loei
   Province in north-eastern Thailand. Although, little knowledge is
   available on the factors affecting population dynamics and individual
   fitness. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the
   population density and body size of the crab. The mark-recapture method
   was conducted in Phu Ruea National Park (PR, small area) and Phu Luang
   Wildlife Sanctuary (PL, large area) between February 2018 and January
   2019. The crabs inhabited mountain streams at 400-1100 m. The average
   water depth and width were 0.6 m and 8.3 m, respectively. In total, 879
   individuals were caught from PL compared to 583 individuals from PR.
   Male were more abundant than female in both areas. Male were also larger
   and heavier, with a mean weight of 145 g, mean carapace width of 76 mm
   and mean carapace length of 75.7 mm. The average number of crabs caught
   was higher in the rainy season (66.3 individuals). The crab population
   was larger in PL (256.7 individuals), which is bigger in size than PR
   and is located farther from urban areas. The average crab density in PL
   and PR were 1.7 and 1.6 crabs/m(2), respectively. Population density was
   significantly correlated with body size parameters: body weight (r(2) =
   0.066, df = 1196, p < 0.001), carapace width (r(2) = 0.053, df = 1196, p
   < 0.001) and carapace length (r(2) = 0.067, df = 1196, p < 0.001). The
   findings of this study suggest that a large area size and high
   population density are important to the conservation of the giant
   mountain crab in mountainous forests.},

Title = {Are all data types and connectivity models created equal? Validating
   common connectivity approaches with dispersal data},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7},
Pages = {868-879},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Aim: There is enormous interest in applying connectivity modelling to
   resistance surfaces for identifying corridors for conservation action.
   However, the multiple analytical approaches used to estimate resistance
   surfaces and predict connectivity across resistance surfaces have not
   been rigorously compared, and it is unclear what methods provide the
   best inferences about population connectivity. Using a large empirical
   data set on puma (Puma concolor), we are the first to compare several of
   the most common approaches for estimating resistance and modelling
   connectivity and validate them with dispersal data.
   Location: Southern California, USA.
   Methods: We estimate resistance using presence-only data, GPS telemetry
   data from puma home ranges and genetic data using a variety of
   analytical methods. We model connectivity with cost distance and circuit
   theory algorithms. We then measure the ability of each data type and
   connectivity algorithm to capture GPS telemetry points of dispersing
   pumas.
   Results: We found that resource selection functions based on GPS
   telemetry points and paths outperformed species distribution models when
   applied using cost distance connectivity algorithms. Point and path
   selection functions were not statistically different in their
   performance, but point selection functions were more sensitive to the
   transformation used to convert relative probability of use to
   resistance. Point and path selection functions and landscape genetics
   outperformed other methods when applied with cost distance; no methods
   outperformed one another with circuit theory.
   Main conclusions: We conclude that path or point selection functions, or
   landscape genetic models, should be used to estimate landscape
   resistance for wildlife. In cases where resource limitations prohibit
   the collection of GPS collar or genetic data, our results suggest that
   species distribution models, while weaker, may still be sufficient for
   resistance estimation. We recommend the use of cost distance-based
   approaches, such as least-cost corridors and resistant kernels, for
   estimating connectivity and identifying functional corridors for
   terrestrial wildlife.},

Journal = {PACHYDERM},
Year = {2017},
Number = {59},
Pages = {56-65},
Month = {JUL-JUN},
Abstract = {Swabbing scat samples is a simple, non-invasive method of obtaining DNA
   samples for population genetic analysis of wild elephants. In this
   study, swab samples were taken from the scat of African savanna
   elephants inhabiting the Galana Wildlife Conservancy (GWC), bordering
   Tsavo East National Park in southeast Kenya. The swab samples were dried
   with silica as opposed to traditional methods of preservation in liquid
   or freezing while in the field. Furthermore, this study examined the
   rate of DNA degradation in scat samples in semi-arid conditions, typical
   of the Galana Wildlife Conservancy, by repeated sampling of scat in the
   field following deposition at defined time intervals over a period of
   two weeks. Results showed that both nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) could be successfully amplified from scat samples up to 128
   hours (about five days) following deposition. Significantly better
   results were obtained from samples taken from the outside of the scat
   than from the centre. Mitochondrial D-loop sequence data suitable for
   phylogenetic analysis was obtained from three fresh samples and one
   sample taken 16 hours after deposition. However, the sequence from a
   sample collected after 128 hours was not of sufficient quality for
   sequencing. Further research is required to determine at which point
   between 16 and 128 hours the DNA becomes too degraded for analysis. The
   mtDNA analysis showed the presence of the Southwest savanna subclade in
   two of the four samples from GWC, which has previously been found in
   only one other sample in Kenya. By confirming the effectiveness of
   silica-dried scat samples for use in DNA analysis, the results of this
   study will facilitate genetic analysis of African elephant populations
   and thereby contribute to efforts to conserve the gene pool of this
   keystone species. The paper contributes to the literature on collecting
   and preserving dung specimens with potential for conservation

Abstract = {In mountains, current land-use changes are altering plant communities of
   semi-natural grasslands with potential cascading effects on associated
   herbivores. Besides vegetation changes, temperature is also a key driver
   of insect diversity, and in the European Alps is predicted to increase
   by 0.25 degrees C per decade. Understanding herbivore responses to
   temperature and plant composition changes in mountain environments is of
   increasing importance. Our study aims at investigating the response to
   temperature and plant diversity and composition of two key herbivore
   groups (orthopterans and leafhoppers) belonging to contrasting feeding
   guilds (chewers vs. sap-feeders). We hypothesized that orthopteran
   diversity would be driven by temperature while leafhoppers by plant
   community composition. We selected 15 dry calcareous grasslands ranging
   from 100 to 1330 m a.s.l. along two independent gradients of plant
   diversity and temperature. We sampled orthopteran and leafhopper species
   richness and abundance by sweep-netting. Consistent with their low
   feeding specialisation, orthopteran species richness and community
   composition were only driven by temperature. By contrast, leafhopper
   species richness was not affected by temperature nor by plant diversity
   but leafhopper community composition was strongly influenced by plant
   species composition. This response can be explained by the higher host
   feeding specialisation of many leafhopper species. Species rarity and
   mobility did not change the response of the diversity of both groups,
   but orthopteran abundance increased with temperature only for highly
   mobile species. Altogether, our results suggest that future responses of
   grassland herbivores to vegetation changes and temperature warming are
   highly variable and depend on the feeding strategy and specialisation of
   the focal herbivore group. Implications for insect conservation
   Leafhoppers emerged to be particularly sensitive to potential management
   or climate-induced change in vegetation composition, while orthopterans
   are expected to respond directly to temperature warming due to their
   relaxed association with plant community diversity and composition.},

Title = {Behavioral adaptations of a large carnivore to human activity in an
   extremely arid landscape},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {433-443},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Driven by the availability of food subsidies and landscape
   transformation, large carnivore populations are increasingly inhabiting
   the vicinity of humans. To persist in human proximity, while avoiding
   conflict and mortality, they must make adjustments in their spatial
   behavior. Understanding such behavioral adaptations can be crucial to
   formulate conservation strategies. We used GPS location data to study
   the movement and space use of protected Arabian wolves in the extremely
   arid Negev Desert (Israel), where natural prey densities are reduced. We
   examined wolf preference for the proximity of human infrastructure,
   while testing the hypothesis that wolves would use areas where ungulates
   were more likely to occur. Wolves showed a strong spatial association
   with humans, spending a large proportion of their time in proximity of
   human infrastructure and moving primarily along roads. Wolves also
   increased their movement during the night. In addition, wolves that had
   higher availability of human infrastructure in their home ranges showed
   increased selection for such features, suggesting a positive functional
   response. Finally, wolves did not show preference for areas of high
   ungulate occurrence at either spatial scale. These findings, combined
   with recent diet analyses, indicate that wolves rely on human subsidies,
   proportioned by the availability of garbage and agricultural produce.
   Our results demonstrate that wolves fine-tune their space use to persist
   in the vicinity of humans. Additional conditions that enable such
   persistence include effective legal protection and positive local
   attitudes toward wolves. We conclude that such circumstances can promote
   spatial coexistence of humans and large carnivores. The strong observed
   spatial association and evident dietary dependence of wolves on
   subsidies from a low-density human population may also reflect the
   conditions that led to dog domestication.},

Title = {Comparison of approaches to combine species distribution models based on
   different sets of predictors},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {39},
Number = {6},
Pages = {561-571},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Distribution models should take into account the different limiting
   factors that simultaneously influence species ranges. Species
   distribution models built with different explanatory variables can be
   combined into more comprehensive ones, but the resulting models should
   maximize complementarity and avoid redundancy. Our aim was to compare
   the different methods available for combining species distribution
   models. We modelled 19 threatened vertebrate species in mainland Spain,
   producing models according to three individual explanatory factors:
   spatial constraints, topography and climate, and human influence. We
   used five approaches for model combination: Bayesian inference, Akaike
   weight averaging, stepwise variable selection, updating, and fuzzy
   logic. We compared the performance of these approaches by assessing
   different aspects of their classification and discrimination capacity.
   We demonstrated that different approaches to model combination give rise
   to disparities in the model outputs. Bayesian integration was
   systematically affected by an error in the equations that are habitually
   used in distribution modelling. Akaike weights produced models that were
   driven by the best single factor and therefore failed at combining the
   models effectively. The updating and the stepwise approaches shared
   recalibration as the basic concept for model combination, were very
   similar in their performance, and showed the highest sensitivity and
   discrimination capacity. The fuzzy-logic approach yielded models with
   the highest classification capacity according to Cohen's kappa. In
   conclusion: 1) Bayesian integration, employing the currently used
   equation, and the Akaike weight procedure should be avoided; 2) the
   updating and stepwise approaches can be considered minor variants of the
   same recalibrating approach; and 3) there is a trade-off between this
   recalibrating approach, which has the highest sensitivity, and fuzzy
   logic, which has the highest overall classification capacity.
   Recalibration is better if unfavourable conditions in one environmental
   factor may be counterbalanced with favourable conditions in a different
   factor, otherwise fuzzy logic is better.},

Title = {Functional connectivity in a continuously distributed, migratory species
   as revealed by landscape genomics},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},
Number = {7},
Pages = {987-999},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Maintaining functional connectivity is critical for the long-term
   conservation of wildlife populations. Landscape genomics provides an
   opportunity to assess long-term functional connectivity by relating
   environmental variables to spatial patterns of genomic variation
   resulting from generations of movement, dispersal and mating behaviors.
   Identifying landscape features associated with gene flow at large
   geographic scales for highly mobile species is becoming increasingly
   possible due to more accessible genomic approaches, improved analytical
   methods and enhanced computational power. We characterized the genetic
   structure and diversity of migratory mule deer Odocoileus hemionus using
   4051 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 406 individuals sampled across
   multiple habitats throughout Wyoming, USA. We then identified
   environmental variables associated with genomic variation within genetic
   groups and statewide using a stepwise approach to first evaluate
   nonlinear relationships of landscape resistance with genetic distances
   and then use mixed-effects modeling to choose top landscape genomic
   models. We identified three admixed genetic groups of mule deer and
   found that environmental variables associated with gene flow varied
   among genetic groups, revealing scale-dependent and regional variation
   in functional connectivity. At the statewide scale, more gene flow
   occurred in areas with low elevation and mixed habitat. In the southern
   genetic group, more gene flow occurred in areas with low elevation. In
   the northern genetic group, more gene flow occurred in grassland and
   forest habitats, while highways and energy infrastructure reduced gene
   flow. In the western genetic group, the null model of isolation by
   distance best represented genetic patterns. Overall, our findings
   highlight the role of different seasonal ranges on mule deer genetic
   connectivity, and show that anthropogenic features hinder connectivity.
   This study demonstrates the value of combining a large, genome-wide
   marker set with recent advances in landscape genomics to evaluate
   functional connectivity in a wide-ranging migratory species.},

Title = {Feeding choices and impacts of extralimital giraffe on two keystone tree
   species in the Kgalagadi National Park},
Journal = {KOEDOE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {59},

Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {In this article we determine the effect of an extralimital megaherbivore
   on the reproductive potential and vegetation structure of two keystone
   tree species in the Auob River in the south western Kalahari Desert of
   southern Africa. Using spoor and dung counts we establish the presence
   of giraffe in three predetermined density zones by walking 50 transects
   across the river in each zone. We also photographed six trees from each
   species in each zone and use these photographs to determine browse
   impact on reproductive potential, canopy volume as well as the
   percentage dieback on the extremities of the canopy. We then perform
   stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis on the leaves of the trees
   and compare these relative to the isotope ratios of giraffe dung to
   ascertain dietary preference. Crude protein was determined as a guide to
   nutritive value. Finally, we determine both chemical and physical
   defences for the two species. Our results show a significant negative
   impact of giraffe browse on tree canopies, no significant differences in
   recruitment and a noticeable decrease in flowers and pods at the giraffe
   browse height of 2 m - 5 m. No significant differences in crude protein
   or condensed tannins were found but significant differences in
   spinescence. Giraffe are not endemic to the Auob River and our study
   shows that the introduction of these animals is having a negative impact
   on the canopies of Vachellia haematoxylon. While there are, as yet, no
   significant impacts on reproductive potential we speculate that this
   will happen with time.
   Conservation implications: Our study shows that giraffe are
   significantly impacting the canopies of two common tree species in the
   Auob River in the arid Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. Without management
   intervention an increasing population of giraffe will result in
   substantial changes to the plant community vegetation structure of the
   river.},

Title = {Host range expansion of native insects to exotic trees increases with

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {52},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Exotic tree species are widely used in forest plantations for their
   often high productivity and performance compared to native trees.
   However, these advantages may be compromised by herbivore damage. A list
   of European insect species that have expanded their host range to one of
   28 exotic tree species introduced to Europe was compiled from a
   systematic literature review. The number of successful expansions was
   analysed using three predictors: (i) phylogenetic relatedness between
   exotic and European tree species; (ii) area covered by exotic tree
   species in Europe; and (iii) time since their introduction into Europe.
   In total, 590 host expansions of native insects to exotic trees were
   found, mainly of polyphagous species (43\%); 25\% of the cases reported
   some type of damage. Bark and wood borers, and defoliators were the
   dominant guilds. The number of recruited native insect species and cases
   where major damage occurred was positively correlated with the
   geographical extent of exotic trees in Europe and the presence of
   congeneric native trees.Synthesis and applications. The use of exotic
   tree species creates opportunities for native insect herbivores to
   expand their host range and increase their damage if they are widely
   planted next to native congeners. Risk assessment studies are
   recommended when introducing new tree species for forestry plantations.
   Risk assessments should include trials on susceptibility to any
   potential damaging organisms in the introduced range.

Abstract = {The optimal design of reserve networks and fisheries closures depends on
   species occurrence information and knowledge of how anthropogenic
   impacts interact with the species concerned. However, challenges in
   surveying mobile and cryptic species over adequate spatial and temporal
   scales can mask the importance of particular habitats, leading to
   uncertainty about which areas to protect to optimize conservation
   efforts. We investigated how telemetry-derived locations can help guide
   the scale and timing of fisheries closures with the aim of reducing
   threatened species bycatch. Forty juvenile speartooth sharks (Glyphis
   glyphis) were monitored over 22 months with implanted acoustic
   transmitters and an array of hydrophone receivers. Using the
   decision-support tool Marxan, we formulated a permanent fisheries
   closure that prioritized areas used more frequently by tagged sharks and
   considered areas perceived as having high value to fisheries. To explore
   how the size of the permanent closure compared with an alternative set
   of time-area closures (i.e., where different areas were closed to
   fishing at different times of year), we used a cluster analysis to group
   months that had similar arrangements of selected planning units
   (informed by shark movements during that month) into 2 time-area
   closures. Sharks were consistent in their timing and direction of
   migratory movements, but the number of tagged sharks made a big
   difference in the placement of the permanent closure; 30 individuals
   were needed to capture behavioral heterogeneity. The dry-season
   (May-January) and wet-season (February-April) time-area closures opened
   20\% and 25\% more planning units to fishing, respectively, compared
   with the permanent closure with boundaries fixed in space and time. Our
   results show that telemetry has the potential to inform and improve
   spatial management of mobile species and that the temporal component of
   tracking data can be incorporated into prioritizations to reduce
   possible impacts of spatial closures on established fisheries.
   Uso de Informacion de Movimiento Basada en Individuos para Identificar
   las Prioridades de Conservacion Espacial para las Especies Moviles El
   diseno optimo de redes de reservas y los cierres de pesquerias depende
   de la informacion sobre la presencia de especies y del conocimiento
   sobre como los impactos antropogenicos interactuan con las especies
   afectadas. Sin embargo, las dificultades que existen al monitorear
   especies moviles y cripticas en escalas espaciales y temporales
   adecuadas pueden enmascarar la importancia de los habitats particulares,
   lo que resulta en incertidumbre con respecto a cuales areas proteger
   para optimizar los esfuerzos de conservacion. Investigamos como las
   ubicaciones derivadas de la telemetria pueden ayudar a guiar la escala y
   el momento justo del cierre de las pesquerias con el objetivo de reducir
   la captura accesoria de especies amenazadas. Se monitorearon 40
   tiburones lanza juveniles (Glyphis glyphis) durante 22 meses con
   transmisores acusticos implantados y una seleccion de receptores
   hidrofonicos. Con la herramienta de apoyo para la toma de decisiones
   Marxan, formulamos un cierre de pesquerias permanente que priorizo las
   areas usadas con frecuencia por los tiburones marcados y que consideraba
   a las areas percibidas como altamente valiosas para las pesquerias. Para
   explorar como el tamano del cierre permanente se comparaba con un
   conjunto de cierres con areas y tiempos alternativos (es decir, donde
   las areas se cerraron a la pesca en diferentes momentos del ano) usamos
   un analisis de cluster para agrupar los meses que tuvieron arreglos
   similares a las unidades de planeacion seleccionadas (informadas por el
   movimiento de los tiburones durante ese mes) en dos cierres de
   tiempo-area. Los tiburones fueron consistentes en el tiempo y direccion
   de sus movimientos migratorios, pero el numero de tiburones marcados
   genero una gran diferencia en la ubicacion del cierre permanente; se
   necesitaron 30 individuos para capturar la heterogeneidad del
   comportamiento. Los cierres de tiempo-area de la temporada de secas
   (mayo - enero) y la de lluvias (febrero - abril) abrieron a la pesca un
   20\% y 25\% mas de unidades de planeacion, respectivamente, en
   comparacion con el cierre permanente con barreras fijas en el tiempo y
   el espacio. Nuestros resultados muestran que la telemetria tiene el
   potencial para informar y mejorar el manejo espacial de las especies
   moviles y que el componente temporal de los datos de rastreo puede ser
   incorporado a las priorizaciones para reducir los posibles impactos del
   manejo sobre las pesquerias establecidas.

Title = {Similar breeding success of bearded vultures in disturbed and

Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Human activities are usually considered as disturbing factors impeding
   the breeding success of wild animals. Protected areas can then be set up
   to restrict such activities aiming to improve wildlife's breeding
   success and conservation. To test for the efficiency of these measures,
   we compared the breeding success of bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus)
   in the western French Pyrenees from autumn 2011 to spring 2017, where
   eyries are located either within or outside restricted areas, where
   potentially disturbing activities are restricted (e.g., helicopter
   flights, forestry works, hunting, paragliding). We monitored reproducing
   bearded vultures and checked the breeding success at different stages
   (laying, incubation, hatching, and survival at 2 months) of formed
   pairs. We then compared the success of each stage between eyries located
   in restricted and non-restricted areas, including weather data in our
   model. We found that the breeding success was similar in both types of
   areas, but that is was negatively impacted by precipitations, which may
   directly affect the ability of the egg or chick to withstand cold. We
   also focused on the potential disturbance of hunting parties on the
   behavior of bearded vultures and found no evidence that hunting was
   perceived as a threat by bearded vultures; they may in fact benefit from
   gut piles. Hence, our comparison of the breeding success between eyries
   located in restricted versus non-restricted areas shows no detrimental
   impact of human activities and calls for some studies to assess the
   effectiveness of restrictions in improving the breeding success of
   bearded vultures, as this species seems to show some degree of tolerance
   to human activities and may significantly suffer from harsh winter
   weather in this area.},

Title = {Abundance estimation from multiple data types for group-living animals:
   An example using dhole (Cuon alpinus)},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Large carnivores are declining globally and require baseline population
   estimates for management, however large-scale population estimation is
   problematic for species without unique natural marks. We used camera
   trap records of dhole Cuon alpinus, a group-living species, from three
   national parks in Thailand as a case study in which we develop
   integrated likelihood models to estimate abundance incorporating two
   different data sets, count data and detection/non-detection data. We
   further investigated relative biases of the models using different
   proportions of data with lower versus higher quality and assessed
   parameter identifiability. The simulations indicated that the relative
   bias on average across 24 tested scenarios was 2\% with a 95\% chance
   that the simulated data sets obtained the true animal abundances. We
   found that bias was high (>10\%) when sampling 60 sites with only 5
   sampling occasions. We tested four additional scenarios with varying
   proportions of count data. Our model tolerated the use of relatively low
   proportions of the higher quality count data, but below 10\% the results
   began to show bias (>6\%). Data cloning indicated that the parameters
   were identifiable with all posterior variances shrinking to near zero.
   Our model demonstrates the benefits of combining data from multiple
   studies even with different data types. Furthermore, the approach is not
   limited to camera trap data. Detection/non-detection data from track
   surveys or counts from transects could also be combined. Particularly,
   our model is potentially useful for assessing populations of rare
   species where large amounts of by-catch datasets are available. (c) 2019

Title = {Evaluation of alternative management strategies for maintenance of
   genetic variation in wildlife populations},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {380-390},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Wildlife management strategies are often designed around a population's
   demographic goals, but such strategies also can inadvertently impact
   genetic variation. For species like bison Bison bison, where management
   includes the regular removal of individuals to maintain restricted
   population sizes on constrained landscapes, management actions can be
   tailored to address genetic diversity retention in addition to simply
   maintaining a target population size. In this study, we provide an
   assessment of alternative culling strategies for maintenance of genetic
   variation in managed wildlife populations. Our primary goal was to
   compare the long-term retention of genetic variation and accumulation of
   inbreeding among three types of culling strategies, including one that
   considered genetic variation directly by measuring variation at a suite
   of variable loci {[}mean allele frequency (MAF) strategy], one that used
   genome-wide measures of variation {[}mean kinship (MK) strategy] and one
   that relied solely on demographic information (sex and age; RANDOM). To
   achieve this goal, we built an individual-based model, parameterized in
   accordance with bison biology, to project levels of genetic variation
   and inbreeding over time under each of the three management strategies.
   Our results suggest wildlife management strategies that incorporate
   goals for retaining genetic variation (MAF and MK strategies) are better
   suited to preserving the evolutionary potential of wildlife populations
   than those that focus solely on a target size and demographic stability
   (RANDOM). In particular, the MK culling strategy performed the best at
   maximizing the retention of genome-wide variation. These results extend
   previous work demonstrating the utility of pedigree-based mate selection
   strategies in captive population management, and show that such
   strategies maximize the retention of genome-wide variation under culling
   practices as well. These models will aid in the long-term management of
   bison, and can be adapted to other managed wildlife species.},

Title = {Where the bears roam in Majella National Park, Italy},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-34},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Brown bear (Ursus arctos Linnaeus, 1758) occupies contiguous areas
   in Eastern and Northern Europe. In Western Europe, the largest remnant
   populations occur in Cantabria, Spain and the Apennines, Italy. Under
   Italian law the bear and its occupied range are protected. The occupied
   range of the Apennine brown bear includes Majella National Park.
   However, information on the distribution within Majella NP is
   extrapolated and inconsistent, thus precluding evidence-based protected
   area and species management. To address this lack of information, bear
   presence records (1996-2010) were collated and corrected for
   observational bias. Multiple Species Distribution Models (SDMs) were
   created at 800m resolution to predict year-round and seasonal bear
   distribution. A hierarchical, stepwise maxent SDM approach was applied
   using climatic, terrain, vegetation, and anthropogenic predictors of
   bear distribution. Occupied ranges were identified by point density
   analysis of bear presence. Our climate-only SDMs predicted bear presence
   in areas with relatively low snowfall and temperate temperatures.
   Year-round bear distribution was also accurately predicted by using
   temperate-montane elevations and mesic, mesotrophic vegetation
   substrates, irrespective of vegetation. Ski-resorts were negative
   predictors of year-round bear occurrence. Bears were predicted in autumn
   and winter by beech forest, in spring by meadows and in summer by a
   variety of vegetation categories. The regional and our local models
   predicted bear throughout the south. However, our predicted and occupied
   range in the north includes the Orta valley and exclude alpine heights,
   contrary to the regional models. Only our summer bear range is similar
   to a regional SDM. We demonstrated that multiple maxent SDMs using a
   modest number of observations and a comprehensive set of environmental
   variables may generate essential distributional information for
   protected area and species management where full wildlife and food
   source censuses are lacking. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {In the contiguous 48 United States, southern Canada, and in Europe,
   wolves (Canis lupus) have greatly increased and expanded their range
   during the past few decades.They are prolific, disperse long distances,
   readily recolonize new areas where humans allow them, and are difficult
   to control when populations become established.Because wolves originally
   lived nearly everywhere throughout North America and Eurasia, and food
   in the form of wild and domestic prey is abundant there, many
   conservation-minded people favor wolves inhabiting even more areas.On
   the other hand, wolves conflict in several ways with rural residents who
   prefer fewer wolves. This article discusses the recovery of wolves,
   their benefits and values, the ways in which they conflict with humans,
   and the potential for their expansion into new areas.It concludes that
   wolf conservation will best be accomplished by each responsible
   political entity adaptively prescribing different management strategies
   for different zones within its purview.Some zones for some periods can
   support total protection, whereas in others, wolf numbers will have to
   be reduced to various degrees or removed.},

Title = {Habitat use by tiger prey in Thailand's Western Forest Complex: What
   will it take to fill a half-full tiger landscape?},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {58},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tiger populations are declining globally, and depletion of major
   ungulate prey is an important contributing factor. To better understand
   factors affecting prey distribution in Thailand's Western Forest Complex
   (WEFCOM), we conducted sign surveys for gaur (Bos gaurus), banteng (Bos
   javanicus), and sambar (Rusa unicolor) along 3517 1-km transects and
   used occupancy models to identify important covariates associated with
   habitat use by each species. Habitat use by both gaur and sambar was
   lowest in areas closest to human settlements, although sambar preferred
   lower slopes near streams whereas gaur preferred steeper slopes at
   higher elevations. Banteng were found in only one of 17 protected areas
   (Huai Kha Khaeng {[}HKK] Wildlife Sanctuary), where they used low
   elevations and low slopes. We used these modeled relationships to
   predict occurrence of gaur, sambar, and banteng across each square km of
   the 19,000 km(2) WEFCOM landscape, using > 60 \% occupancy probability
   to define suitable habitat use for each species. Based on this
   criterion, gaur and sambar occupied 28 and 50 \% of suitable habitat in
   WEFCOM, and banteng occupied 57 \% of suitable habitat in HKK. We used
   our models to assess the effectiveness of two hypothetical conservation
   initiatives. First, we modeled the impact of decreasing human activities
   around nine villages in the core of WEFCOM, which increased predicted
   suitable habitat in WEFCOM to 68 and 75 \% for guar and sambar. We also
   modeled the extent of potential banteng habitat that still remains in
   the other 16 protected areas. This could result in a 4-fold increase in
   banteng suitable habitat in WEFCOM. This is the first study to use
   occupancy surveys to determine where large prey species can be restored
   to support management to increase the distribution of tigers, and
   potentially fill a half-full tiger landscape.},

Title = {Increases in the Number of American Black Ducks Wintering in Nova
   Scotia, 1970-2015},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {669-675},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Despite extensive conservation and management efforts, American black
   duck (Anas rubripes) populations remain below desired population levels.
   Researchers have noted declines at a number of wintering areas, but
   indications are that wintering populations in the northern part of the
   range are increasing. Intermittently between 1970 and 1989, and annually
   since 1992, wildlife biologists have flown aerial surveys of the entire
   coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, to count wintering waterfowl. This survey
   counted the total number of ducks seen in predefined lengths of
   coastline. We analyzed those survey data using generalized linear mixed
   models, over the entire time period (1970-2015) and in the recent time
   period (1992-2015, when surveys were done every year), across five
   general regions of Nova Scotia. We fit models using Bayesian methods
   with uninformative priors; models with negative binomial response
   distributions performed well. Due to the large variation in mean numbers
   of black ducks across the predefined lengths of coastline, we treated
   these blocks of coastline as a fixed effect, while annual trend (slope)
   was modeled as a random effect to account for variation in annual trend
   across blocks of coastline. Results were similar between the entire time
   series (1970-2015) or the most recent and more complete time series
   (1992-2015). In general, numbers of wintering black ducks in Nova Scotia
   increased (1.0-16.0\%/y) and increases were significant (Bayesian
   credible intervals did not bound 0) in four of five regions. Increasing
   numbers in Nova Scotia are consistent with other observations of
   increasing wintering numbers at the northern range of American black
   ducks and may indicate a shift in the wintering range that has been
   ongoing for decades. Future habitat management actions will benefit from
   consideration of regional trends and the distributional change of black
   duck.},

Title = {Landscape change shifts competitive dynamics between declining at-risk
   wolverines and range-expanding coyotes, compelling a new conservation
   focus},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {266},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Conservation actions need to target ecological mechanisms of species
   declines to be effective, but these mechanisms are often opaque.
   Shifting balance of competition is one pathway to species declines.
   Competitive coexistence is maintained only where competitive pressures
   balance across space. As resources change and new resources are
   introduced or disappear across landscapes, so should competition
   outcomes. We tested how novel anthropogenic disturbances affect this
   competitive landscape in a region with a diverse large carnivore
   community. We modelled fine-resolution spatiotemporal co-occurrence of
   wolverine (Gulo gulo), an at-risk Nearctic facultative scavenger, and
   other competing carnivores. We posed hypotheses about the different
   interspecific interactions - competition, predation, and facilitation -
   that could affect wolverine distribution across a gradient of
   anthropogenic disturbance. We used an information-theoretic
   model-selection framework to weigh evidence for hypotheses about the
   outcomes of interspecific interactions, inferred from habitat selection
   in relation to co occurrence or segregation with other carnivores.
   Wolverine occurrence in space and time was explained by anthropogenic
   disturbance features and coyote co-occurrence at sites, revealing that
   coyote occurrence is a synergistic factor with anthropogenic
   disturbance. Wolverine were generally segregated from coyotes and
   avoided linear features; however if wolverine and coyotes did co-occur,
   they were twice as likely to co-occur at sites with linear features.
   Thus linear features increased opportunity for coyotes-a generalist
   species thriving in human disturbed landscapes - to compete with
   wolverines. We suggest this threat of increased competition is a
   mechanism potentially contributing to broad-scale wolverine range
   recessions from increasingly disturbed areas. Landscape change manifests
   as more than just physical disturbances: it alters the ecological
   processes that structure communities. These processes contribute to
   declines of species that cannot adapt to the novel disturbance features.
   We emphasize competition as an overlooked outcome of landscape change
   that could inform better conservation decisions to stem species
   declines.},

Abstract = {Animal welfare is increasingly important in the understanding of how
   human activity affects wildlife, but the conservation community is still
   grappling with meaningful terminology when communicating this aspect of
   their work. One example is the use of the terms ``humane{''} and
   ``inhumane.{''} These terms are used in scientific contexts, but they
   also have legal and social definitions. Without reference to a defined
   technical standard, describing an action or outcome as humane (or
   inhumane) constrains science communication because the terms have
   variable definitions; establish a binary (something is either humane or
   inhumane); and imply underlying values reflecting a moral prescription.
   Invoking the term ``humane,{''} and especially the strong antithesis
   ``inhumane,{''} can infer a normative judgment of how animals ought to
   be treated (humane) or ought not to be treated (inhumane). The
   consequences of applying this terminology are not just academic.
   Publicizing certain practices as humane can create blurred lines around
   contentious animal welfare questions and, perhaps intentionally, defer
   scrutiny of actual welfare outcomes. Labeling other practices as
   inhumane can be used cynically to erode their public support. We suggest
   that, if this normative language is used in science, it should always be
   accompanied by a clear, contextual definition of what is meant by
   humane.},

Title = {Integrating citizen-science and planned-survey data improves species

Volume = {27},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Aim Mapping species distributions is a crucial but challenging
   requirement of wildlife management. The frequent need to sample vast
   expanses of potential habitat increases the cost of planned surveys and
   rewards accumulation of opportunistic observations. In this paper, we
   integrate planned-survey data from roost counts with opportunistic
   samples from eBird, WikiAves and Xeno-canto citizen-science platforms to
   map the geographic range of the endangered Vinaceous-breasted Parrot. We
   demonstrate the estimation and mapping of species occurrence based on
   data integration while accounting for specifics of each dataset,
   including observation technique and uncertainty about the observations.
   Location Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. Methods Our analysis
   illustrates (a) the incorporation of sampling effort, spatial
   autocorrelation and site covariates in a joint-likelihood, hierarchical,
   data integration model; (b) the evaluation of the contribution of each
   dataset, as well as the contribution of effort covariates, spatial
   autocorrelation and site covariates to the predictive ability of fitted
   models using a cross-validation approach; and (c) how spatial
   representation of the latent occupancy state (i.e. realized occupancy)
   helps identify areas with high uncertainty that should be prioritized in
   future fieldwork. Results We estimate a Vinaceous-breasted Parrot
   geographic range of 434,670 km(2), which is three times larger than the
   ``Extant{''} area previously reported in the IUCN Red List. The
   exclusion of one dataset at a time from the analyses always resulted in
   worse predictions by the models of truncated data than by the Full
   Model, which included all datasets. Likewise, exclusion of spatial
   autocorrelation, site covariates or sampling effort resulted in worse
   predictions. Main conclusions The integration of different datasets into
   one joint-likelihood model produced a more reliable representation of
   the species range than any individual dataset taken on its own,
   improving the use of citizen-science data in combination with
   planned-survey results.},

Title = {Managing conservation flagship species in competition: Tiger, leopard

Abstract = {Managing populations of large carnivore species that are threatened yet
   in competition with each other presents a conservation challenge over
   which species to prioritise. We investigated interspecific competition
   between the Endangered tiger and two sympatric carnivore species
   (Near-Threatened leopard and Endangered dhole) in Malaysia. We used a
   spatially-explicit camera trapping method to sample the three carnivore
   species in order to assess their: relative abundance; spatial
   co-occurrence; and, temporal overlap. Our focal landscape consists of
   two adjacent study areas that have different forest management regimes:
   1) Royal Belum State Park (RBSP) which has relatively higher levels of
   enforcement resulting in high tiger and prey densities, and 2) Temengor
   Forest Reserve (TFR) which has no enforcement resulting in low tiger and
   prey densities. Our analyses found inter specific competition in the
   form of fine-scale spatial avoidance of tiger by leopard in RBSP, but
   not in TFR. Thus, leopard was less likely to occur in forest patches
   with greater tiger presence in RBSP. Dhole was not detected in RBSP, and
   showed no fine-scale spatial avoidance of tiger on TRF. It was unclear
   if absence of dhole in RBSP was due to the high tiger density, or
   another factor such as disease. Regardless, our results indicate dhole
   can persist in human-degraded forest landscapes. Neither leopards nor
   dholes showed any major temporal avoidance of tigers on either site. Our
   findings of fine-scale spatial avoidance by leopard towards tiger and
   possible exclusion of dhole by tiger in areas of high tiger density were
   similar to that found in other areas of Asia. Our study demonstrates
   that degraded forest can be important for threatened carnivores. It also
   provides a reminder that efforts to recover tiger populations, a
   conservation priority, may require flanking measures to secure
   meso-predator populations, especially those forced into edge
   environments where they come into greater contact with people. (C) 2016

Title = {Why do wolves eat livestock? Factors influencing wolf diet in northern
   Italy},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {195},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Thanks to protection by law and increasing habitat restoration, wolves
   (Canis lupus) are currently re-colonizing Europe from the surviving
   populations of Russia, the Balkan countries, Spain and Italy, raising
   the need to update conservation strategies. A major conservation issue
   is to restore connections and gene flow among fragmented populations,
   thus contrasting the deleterious consequences of isolation. Wolves in
   Italy are expanding from the Apennines towards the Alps, crossing the
   Ligurian Mountains (northern Italy) and establishing connections with
   the Dinaric populations. Wolf expansion is threatened by poaching and
   incidental killings, mainly due to livestock depredations and conflicts
   with shepherds, which could limit the establishment of stable
   populations. Aiming to find out the factors affecting the use of
   livestock by wolves, in this study we determined the composition of wolf
   diet in Liguria. We examined 1457 scats collected from 2008 to 2013.
   Individual scats were genotyped using a non-invasive genetic procedure,
   and their content was determined using microscopical analyses. Wolves in
   Liguria consumed mainly wild ungulates (64.4\%; in particular wild boar
   Sus scrofa and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) and, to a lesser extent,
   livestock (26.3\%; in particular goats Capra hircus). We modeled the
   consumption of livestock using environmental features, wild ungulate
   community diversity, husbandry characteristics and wolf social
   organization (stable packs or dispersing individuals). Wolf diet varied
   according to years and seasons with an overall decrease of livestock and
   an increase of wild ungulate consumption, but also between packs and
   dispersing individuals with greater livestock consumption for the
   latter. The presence of stable packs, instead of dispersing wolves, the
   adoption of prevention measures on pastures, roe deer abundance, and the
   percentage of deciduous woods, reduced predation on livestock. Thus, we
   suggest promoting wild ungulate expansion, the use of prevention tools
   in pastures, and supporting wolf pack establishment, avoiding lethal
   control and poaching, to mitigate conflicts between wolf conservation
   and husbandry. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {In the cold and arid mountains of Central Asia, where the diversity and
   abundance of wild ungulates are generally low, resource partitioning
   among coexisting carnivores is probably less distinct than in prey-rich
   areas. Thus, similar-sized carnivores are likely to compete for food. We
   compared the summer diets of snow leopards Panthera uncia and wolves
   Canis lupus in Sarychat-Ertash Reserve in the Tien-Shan mountains of
   Kyrgyzstan, based on analysis of genetically confirmed scats. Abundances
   of the principal prey species, argali Ovis ammon and Siberian ibex Capra
   sibirica, were estimated from field surveys. The diets consisted of few
   species, with high interspecific overlap (Pianka's index = 0.91). Argali
   was the predominant prey, with > 50\% frequency of occurrence in both
   snow leopard and wolf scats. This was followed by Siberian ibex and
   marmots Marmota baibacina. Being largely unavailable, remains of
   livestock were not detected in any of the scats. In the snow leopard
   diet, proportions of argali and ibex were in line with the relative
   availabilities of these animals in the Reserve. This was in contrast to
   the diet of wolf, where argali occurred according to availability and
   ibex was significantly underrepresented. The high diet overlap indicates
   that the two predators might compete for food when the diversity of
   profitable, large prey is low. Competition may be more intense in
   winter, when marmots are not available. Hunting of argali and ibex
   outside the Reserve may be unsustainable and therefore reduce their
   abundances over time. This will affect both predators negatively and
   intensify competition for food. Reduction in ibex populations will
   directly affect the snow leopard, and the wolf is likely to be
   indirectly affected as a result of increased snow leopard predation of
   argali.},

Title = {INVESTIGATION OF FACTORS AFFECTING. BLACK-FOOTED FERRET LITTER SIZE},
Journal = {WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Pages = {108-115},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Understanding factors that influence recruitment can improve wildlife
   conservation. Endangered blackfooted ferrets (Mustela nigripes) rely on
   prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) for food and on prairie dog burrows for
   shelter. We hypothesized that younger female ferrets with greater
   densities of prairie dogs in their core use area and fewer adult ferrets
   in their respective prairie dog colony, would produce more kits due to
   age-dependent productivity, increased food resources, and decreased
   competition. We used generalized linear mixed-effects regression and
   Akaike's information criterion adjusted for sample size (AICc) to rank
   models relating adult female black-footed ferret litter size (range 1-7
   kits, n = 24 litters) to female age, core area density of prairie dogs,
   and adult ferret densities from 3 sites in the USA, 2005-2008. We
   included year and site as random effects in all models. We observed
   great model uncertainty; the null model was most supported and received
   44\% of model weight (w). The next best-supported model included ferret
   density only (AAIC, = 1.55, w = 0.20). Ferret density may not have been
   great enough to negatively affect prey acquisition and litter sizes.
   Mean litter size did not vary among female ages, but inference was
   limited because only one individual was >3 years old (F = 2.13 years, SD
   = 0.99). All adult females produced kits, suggesting that the observed
   minimum prairie dog density in ferret core use areas (12.3 individuals
   ha-l-) was above a threshold of minimal prey abundance for reproduction.
   Our findings support previous selections of reintroduction sites as
   those meeting minimum resource needs of individual ferrets for
   reproduction. Future selections of reintroduction sites may become more
   difficult if the number of areas with the minimum necessary prairie dog
   density decreases due to disease and reductions in habitat availability.},

Title = {Floristic diversity and stocking rate in tropical dry forest secondary
   vegetation used for grazing},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The natural process of ecological regeneration in tropical regions in
   conjunction with local livestock management practices creates grazing
   environments with high floristic diversity and structural complexity.
   Yet, these environments are being neglected despite the opportunities
   and benefits for domestic herbivores. Voisin grazing (VG) is better in
   such highly biodiverse environments, as this management system seeks to
   improve forage utilization by coupling forage allowance with livestock
   needs for forage, using small paddocks, high stock densities over short
   occupation periods, and allowing plants to fully recover after grazing.
   Floristic diversity, biomass and stocking rate were assessed in sites
   having tropical dry forest secondary vegetation undergoing grazing. Six
   sites having extensive seasonal grazing were studied by placing 10 x 10
   m(2) quadrats across sites to list woody species and nested 2 x 2 m(2)
   frames for listing herbaceous vegetation. The response of vegetation to
   Voisin grazing (VG) was evaluated in one of the six sites (split into 15
   paddocks having 400-m(2) each). A total of 191 species (from all sites)
   including 50 potential forage species were listed. Quadrats were
   classified into two groups, one contained more preserved vegetation
   dominated by woody species, and the other a less preserved group
   dominated by herbaceous and shrub species. Available forage biomass
   across sites ranged from 1000 to 1200 kg DM ha(-1) (30-70\% woody
   biomass), supporting low stocking rates (0.2-0.3 AU ha(-1)). In the site
   where VG was implemented, most of the identified species were forage
   (56/58). After one year of VG, the most productive paddocks (2500-3800
   kg DM ha(-1)) were dominated by forbs and the least productive ones (800
   2000 kg DM ha(-1)) were dominated by woody species, yielding an overall
   stocking rate of 1.2 AU ha(-1). Based on forage botanical composition,
   three groups of paddocks were identified: 1) dominated by grasses, 2)
   heterogeneous forage diversity, and 3) dominated by forbs and shrubs.
   Pastures recovered in 47-89 d during the 2017 rainy season, 50 123 d
   during the transition to the dry season, and 210-290 d during the 2018
   dry season. Secondary vegetation provides high floristic diversity and a
   large number of forage plant species, but low forage yield and stocking
   rates. Yet, implementation of a proper grazing system such as VG
   gradually enhances yield and stocking rates. (C) 2020 The Authors.

   carteri) nestlings have been attributed to avian cholera, caused by the
   bacteriumPasteurella multocida. In order to help implementing efficient
   measures for the control of this disease, it is critical to better
   understand the local epidemiology ofP. multocidaand to examine its
   inter- and intra-annual infection dynamics. We evaluated the infection
   status of 264 yellow-nosed albatrosses over four successive breeding
   seasons using a real-time PCR targetingP. multocidaDNA from cloacal
   swabs. Infection prevalence patterns revealed an intense circulation
   ofP. multocidathroughout the survey, with a steady but variable increase
   in infection prevalence within each breeding season. These epizootics
   were associated with massive nestling dies-offs, inducing very low
   fledging successes (<= 20\%). These results suggest important variations
   in the transmission dynamics of this pathogen. These findings and the
   developed PCR protocol have direct applications to guide future research
   and refine conservation plans aiming at controlling the disease.},

Abstract = {Current climate change is disrupting biotic interactions and eroding
   biodiversity worldwide. However, species sensitive to aridity, high
   temperatures, and climate variability might find shelter in
   microclimatic refuges, such as leaf rolls built by arthropods. To
   explore how the importance of leaf shelters for terrestrial arthropods
   changes with latitude, elevation, and climate, we conducted a
   distributed experiment comparing arthropods in leaf rolls versus control
   leaves across 52 sites along an 11,790 km latitudinal gradient. We then
   probed the impact of short- versus long-term climatic impacts on roll
   use, by comparing the relative impact of conditions during the
   experiment versus average, baseline conditions at the site. Leaf
   shelters supported larger organisms and higher arthropod biomass and
   species diversity than non-rolled control leaves. However, the magnitude
   of the leaf rolls' effect differed between long- and short-term climate
   conditions, metrics (species richness, biomass, and body size), and
   trophic groups (predators vs. herbivores). The effect of leaf rolls on
   predator richness was influenced only by baseline climate, increasing in
   magnitude in regions experiencing increased long-term aridity,
   regardless of latitude, elevation, and weather during the experiment.
   This suggests that shelter use by predators may be innate, and thus,
   driven by natural selection. In contrast, the effect of leaf rolls on
   predator biomass and predator body size decreased with increasing
   temperature, and increased with increasing precipitation, respectively,
   during the experiment. The magnitude of shelter usage by herbivores
   increased with the abundance of predators and decreased with increasing
   temperature during the experiment. Taken together, these results
   highlight that leaf roll use may have both proximal and ultimate causes.
   Projected increases in climate variability and aridity are, therefore,
   likely to increase the importance of biotic refugia in mitigating the
   effects of climate change on species persistence.},

Abstract = {As ecological data and associated analyses become more widely available,
   synthesizing results for effective communication with stakeholders is
   essential. In the case of wildlife corridors, managers in
   human-dominated landscapes need to identify both the locations of
   corridors and multiple stakeholders for effective oversight. We
   synthesized five independent studies of tiger (Panthera tigris)
   connectivity in central India, a global priority landscape for tiger
   conservation, to quantify agreement on landscape permeability for tiger
   movement and potential movement pathways. We used the latter analysis to
   identify connectivity areas on which studies agreed and stakeholders
   associated with these areas to determine relevant participants in
   corridor management. Three or more of the five studies' resistance
   layers agreed in 63\% of the study area. Areas in which all studies
   agree on resistance were of primarily low (66\%, e.g., forest) and high
   (24\%, e.g., urban) resistance. Agreement was lower in intermediate
   resistance areas (e.g., agriculture). Despite these differences, the
   studies largely agreed on areas with high levels of potential movement:
   >40\% of high average (top 20\%) current-flow pixels were also in the
   top 20\% of current-flow agreement pixels (measured by low variation),
   indicating consensus connectivity areas (CCAs) as conservation
   priorities. Roughly 70\% of the CCAs fell within village administrative
   boundaries, and 100\% overlapped forest department management
   boundaries, suggesting that people live and use forests within these
   priority areas. Over 16\% of total CCAs' area was within 1 km of linear
   infrastructure (437 road, 170 railway, 179 transmission line, and 339
   canal crossings; 105 mines within 1 km of CCAs). In 2019, 78\% of forest
   land diversions for infrastructure and mining in Madhya Pradesh (which
   comprises most of the study region) took place in districts with CCAs.
   Acute competition for land in this landscape with globally important
   wildlife corridors calls for an effective comanagement strategy
   involving local communities, forest departments, and infrastructure
   planners.},

Title = {Perceptions of challenges to subsistence agriculture, and crop foraging

Abstract = {The 2009-2010 Sierra Leone National Chimpanzee Census Project estimated
   there was a population of 5,580 chimpanzees Pan troglodytes verus
   distributed across the country, with > 50\% occurring outside protected
   areas. The census also highlighted the significance of competition
   between people and chimpanzees for resources in areas dominated by
   farming activities where wild chimpanzees forage on crops. We selected
   four study areas in two districts in Sierra Leone with high chimpanzee
   density in habitats dominated by agriculture, far from any protected
   areas. Our objectives were to assess farmers' perceptions of the main
   challenges to their agricultural yields, and the wildlife involved in
   crop foraging, and their perceptions of chimpanzees in particular, as
   well as the main crop protection measures used. We conducted 257
   semi-structured interviews with local farmers across the four study
   areas. We found that (1) farmers reported wild animals as the main
   challenge to their agricultural practices; (2) most complaints concerned
   cane rats Thryonomys swinderianus, which targeted almost all crop types,
   especially rice and cassava; (3) chimpanzees reportedly targeted 21 of
   the 23 crop types cultivated, but did so less often than cane rats,
   focusing particularly on oil palm, cassava and domestic fruits; (4)
   overall, chimpanzees were not among the top three most destructive
   animals reported; (5) chimpanzees were generally perceived as being more
   destructive than dangerous and as having declined since before the civil
   war; and (6) the main crop protection measure employed was fencing
   interspersed with traps. Our findings show the importance of
   investigating farmers' perceptions to inform the development of
   appropriate conservation strategies aimed at promoting coexistence of
   people and wildlife in degraded landscapes.},

Title = {Consequences of migratory coupling of predators and prey when mediated

Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Aim Animal migrations influence ecosystem structure, dynamics and
   persistence of predator and prey populations. The theory of migratory
   coupling postulates that aggregations of migrant prey can induce
   large-scale synchronized movements in predators, and this coupling is
   consequential for the dynamics of ecological communities. The degree to
   which humans influence these interactions remains largely unknown. We
   tested whether creation of large resource pulses by humans such as
   seasonal herding of reindeer Rangifer tarandus and hunting of moose,
   Alces alces, can induce migratory coupling with Golden Eagles, Aquila
   chrysaetos, and whether these lead to demographic consequences for the
   eagles. Location Fennoscandia. Methods We used movement data from 32
   tracked Golden Eagles spanning 125 annual migratory cycles over 8 years.
   We obtained reindeer distribution data through collaboration with
   reindeer herders based on satellite tracking of reindeer, and moose
   harvest data from the national hunting statistics for Sweden. We
   assessed demographic consequences for eagles from ingesting lead from
   ammunition fragments in moose carcasses through survival estimates and
   their links with lead concentrations in eagles' blood. Results In
   spring, eagles migrated hundreds of kilometres to be spatially and
   temporally coupled with calving reindeer, whereas in autumn, eagles
   matched their distribution with the location and timing of moose hunt.
   Juveniles were more likely to couple with reindeer calving, whereas
   adults were particularly drawn to areas of higher moose harvest. Due to
   this coupling, eagles ingested lead from spent ammunition in moose offal
   and carcasses and the resulting lead toxicity increased the risk of
   mortality by 3.4 times. Main conclusions We show how migratory coupling
   connects landscape processes and that human actions can influence
   migratory coupling over large spatial scales and increase demographic
   risks for predators. We provide vital knowledge towards resolving
   human-wildlife conflicts and the conservation of protected species over
   a large spatial and temporal scale.},

Title = {Factors affecting the success of artificial pack formation in an

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Social integration is an important factor when reintroducing
   group-living species, but examples of the formation of social groups
   before reintroduction are largely lacking. African wild dogs Lycaon
   pictus are endangered, and reintroductions have become a routine part of
   range expansion in South Africa. Wild dogs form packs that are essential
   to their reproduction and survival, and artificial pack formation is
   often required before reintroduction. We examined the proximate (i.e.
   social integration) and ultimate (i.e. reproduction) success of 43
   artificial pack formation attempts in the South African managed
   metapopulation, between 1995 and 2018. The top (and dominant) model for
   proximate success included an interaction between total group size and
   an initial separation fence. Larger groups took longer to integrate,
   irrespective of initial separation, whereas smaller groups brought
   together immediately integrated faster than those that were initially
   separated. The top models for ultimate success included an interaction
   between the proportion of males and number of days spent in the
   pre-release enclosure, the total number of days in the enclosure and an
   interaction between the proportion of captive-sourced individuals and
   the total number of days in the enclosure. Ultimate success increased
   when packs spent less time in the enclosure, especially if those packs
   had a low proportion of males (i.e. female biased) or included >25\%
   captive-sourced individuals. Neither the size of the artificially
   created pack nor the season in which the pack was released affected
   ultimate success. The success of social integration and reproductive
   success of artificially formed packs in this study was higher than for
   natural pack formations. We provide guidelines for optimizing future
   artificial pack formation in wild dogs for reintroduction success. Our
   results serve as an example of the practical importance of social
   behavior in successfully implementing conservation measures for
   group-living species.},

Title = {Group size and social organization of the endangered Eld's deer
   (Rucervus eldii thamin): Results from a long-term study in Myanmar},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Eld's deer (Rucervus eldii thamin) is an endangered endemic species
   of Myanmar. The largest existing wild population of this species is
   localized in Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS). Although SWS is
   believed to hold the largest population of wild Eld's deer, there has
   been no investigative research carried out on the field ecology of this
   species in this specific region. In this study, we examined the status
   of social organization with increasing population density of Eld's deer
   in SWS by analyzing long-term monitoring data (2001-2018). We also
   investigated the potential environmental factors that might affect their
   social organization and grouping patterns by analyzing five years data
   (2014-2018) in SWS. We found that the mean group size and crowding of
   Eld's deer for the hot dry season in Myanmar was 7.6 +/- 0.9 and 11.1,
   respectively. The population of Eld's deer in SWS has increased steadily
   during these 18 years, and the fawn to adult female ratio (the
   proportion of fawns) has increased and is positively associated with
   increasing density of Eld's deer. Although the adult sex ratio was
   slightly skewed towards females, this ratio did not show any detectable
   relationship with increasing population density. Eld's deer strongly
   avoided areas close to human settlements and roads. Larger groups of
   Eld's deer showed preferences of scrub and grassland to the degraded
   forest habitat because this type of habitat in SWS is commonly
   associated with military areas where intrusion by people is strictly
   prohibited. We conclude that it is crucially important to manage or
   protect the remaining natural habitat of Eld's deer in SWS so that
   disturbance is reduced and the population can be conserved effictively.

Abstract = {Pollination can be an essential but often neglected ecosystem service to
   mitigate crop yield gaps. Pollination services are usually studied in
   isolation, and their relative role and possible interactions with other
   factors, such as major management practices, is little understood. We
   tested how pollination (insect vs. wind- and self-pollination) interacts
   with weed control, fertilization and insect herbivore control and how
   these factors as well as flower-visiting bees influence fruit set and
   yield of cucumber Cucumis sativus L. in 13 traditional Indonesian home
   gardens. Although insect pollination, fertilization and weed control
   additively increased crop yield, fertilization and weed control alone
   could not compensate for pollination loss. Pollination individually
   accounted for 75\% of the yield and was, hence, the most important
   driver of yield. In contrast, herbivore control through insecticides at
   commonly applied levels did not increase yield. Yield strongly increased
   with higher number of flower-visiting bee individuals, while the number
   of bee individuals in turn was not influenced by weed control,
   fertilization or herbivore control, but increased with higher number of
   cucumber flowers.Synthesis and applications. Although multiple
   management practices influence yield, they cannot compensate yield gaps
   from pollinator loss in cucumber smallholder production in Indonesia.
   Our results also show that the widespread use of insecticides without
   considering the impacts on pest reduction is uneconomical. Here,
   reducing insecticides caused no income loss and, at the same time,
   reduces potential risks to important pollinators, which needs to be
   acknowledged by policy-driven regulations for pesticide application in
   tropical agroecosystems. Our results stress the importance of enhancing
   bee populations to facilitate pollination services. Bee management
   practices, such as sustaining additional food resources for pollinators,
   need to be established.

Title = {Towards a framework for assessment and management of cumulative human
   impacts on marine food webs},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Effective ecosystem-based management requires understanding ecosystem
   responses to multiple human threats, rather than focusing on single
   threats. To understand ecosystem responses to anthropogenic threats
   holistically, it is necessary to know how threats affect different
   components within ecosystems and ultimately alter ecosystem functioning.
   We used a case study of a Mediterranean seagrass (Posidonia oceanica)
   food web and expert knowledge elicitation in an application of the
   initial steps of a framework for assessment of cumulative human impacts
   on food webs. We produced a conceptual seagrass food web model,
   determined the main trophic relationships, identified the main threats
   to the food web components, and assessed the components' vulnerability
   to those threats. Some threats had high (e.g., coastal infrastructure)
   or low impacts (e.g., agricultural runoff) on all food web components,
   whereas others (e.g., introduced carnivores) had very different impacts
   on each component. Partitioning the ecosystem into its components
   enabled us to identify threats previously overlooked and to reevaluate
   the importance of threats commonly perceived as major. By incorporating
   this understanding of system vulnerability with data on changes in the
   state of each threat (e.g., decreasing domestic pollution and increasing
   fishing) into a food web model, managers may be better able to estimate
   and predict cumulative human impacts on ecosystems and to prioritize
   conservation actions.
   Hacia un Marco de Trabajo para la Evaluacion y el Manejo de los Impactos
   Humanos Acumulativos sobre las Redes Alimenticias Marinas El manejo
   efectivo con base en los ecosistemas requiere entender la respuesta de
   los ecosistemas a multiples amenazas humanas en lugar de enfocarse en
   amenazas individuales. Para entender holisticamente la respuesta de los
   ecosistemas a las multiples amenazas antropogenicas es necesario saber
   como estas amenazas afectan a los diferentes componentes dentro de los
   ecosistemas y como alteran finalmente el funcionamiento de los
   ecosistemas. Usamos el estudio de caso de la red alimenticia del pasto
   marino del Mediterraneo (Posidonia oceanica) y la obtencion de
   conocimiento de expertos en una aplicacion de los pasos iniciales de un
   metodo para la evaluacion de los impactos humanos acumulativos sobre las
   redes alimenticias. Produjimos un modelo de red alimenticia de pastos
   marinos, determinamos las principales relaciones troficas, identificamos
   a las principales amenazas para los componentes de la red y evaluamos la
   vulnerabilidad de los componentes a esas amenazas. Algunas amenazas
   tuvieron impactos altos (p. ej.: infraestructura costera) o bajos (p.
   ej.: escorrentia agricola) sobre todos los componentes de la red,
   mientras que otros (p. ej.: carnivoros introducidos) tuvieron impactos
   muy diferentes sobre cada componente. Partir al ecosistema en sus
   componentes nos permitio identificar amenazas no vistas previamente y
   reevaluar la importancia de las amenazas percibidas comunmente como
   mayores. Al incorporar este entendimiento de la vulnerabilidad del
   sistema con datos sobre los cambios en el estado de cada amenaza (p.
   ej.: disminucion de la contaminacion domestica e incremento de la pesca)
   al modelo de red alimenticia, los manejadores pueden ser capaces de
   estimar y predecir de mejor manera los impactos humanos acumulativos
   sobre los ecosistemas y priorizar las acciones de conservacion.

Title = {Estimating Trend in Occupancy for the Southern Sierra Fisher Martes
   pennanti Population},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-19},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Carnivores are important elements of biodiversity, not only because of
   their role in transferring energy and nutrients, but also because they
   influence the structure of the communities where they occur. The fisher
   Martes pennanti is a mammalian carnivore that is associated with
   late-successional mixed forests in the Sierra Nevada in California, and
   is vulnerable to the effects of forest management. As a candidate for
   endangered species status, it is important to monitor its population to
   determine whether actions to conserve it are successful. We implemented
   a monitoring program to estimate change in occupancy of fishers across a
   12,240-km(2) area in the southern Sierra Nevada. Sample units were about
   4 km apart, consisting of six enclosed, baited track-plate stations, and
   aligned with the national Forest Inventory and Analysis grid. We report
   here the results of 8 y (2002-2009) of sampling of a core set of 223
   sample units. We model the combined effects of probability of detection
   and occupancy to estimate occupancy, persistence rates, and trend in
   occupancy. In combined models, we evaluated four forms of detection
   probability (1-group and 2-group both constant and varying by year) and
   nine forms of probability of occupancy (differing primarily by how
   occupancy and persistence vary among years). The best-fitting model
   assumed constant probability of occupancy, constant persistence, and two
   detection groups (AIC weight = 0.707). This fit the data best for the
   entire study area as well as two of the three distinct geographic zones
   therein. The one zone with a trend parameter found no significant
   difference from zero for that parameter. This suggests that, over the
   8-y period, that there was no trend or statistically significant
   variations in occupancy. The overall probability of occupancy, adjusted
   to account for uncertain detection, was 0.367 (SE = 0.033) and estimates
   were lowest in the southeastern zone (0.261) and highest in the
   southwestern zone (0.583). Constant and positive persistence values
   suggested that sample units rarely changed status from occupied to
   unoccupied or vice versa. The small population of fishers in the
   southern Sierra (probably <250 individuals) does not appear to be
   decreasing. However, given the habitat degradation that has occurred in
   forests of the region, we favor continued monitoring to determine
   whether fisher occupancy increases as land managers implement measures
   to restore conditions favorable to fishers.},

Title = {Putting insects on the map: near-global variation in sphingid moth
   richness along spatial and environmental gradients},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {6},
Pages = {698-708},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Despite their vast diversity and vital ecological role, insects are
   notoriously underrepresented in biogeography and conservation, and key
   broad-scale ecological hypotheses about them remain untested-largely due
   to generally incomplete and very coarse spatial distribution knowledge.
   Integrating records from publications, field work and natural history
   collections, we used a mixture of species distribution models and expert
   estimates to provide geographic distributions and emergent richness
   patterns for all ca 1000 sphingid moth species found outside the
   Americas in high spatial detail. Total sphingid moth richness, the first
   for a higher insect group to be documented at this scale, shows distinct
   maxima in the wet tropics of Africa and the Oriental with notable decay
   toward Australasia. Using multivariate models controlling for spatial
   autocorrelation, we found that primary productivity is the dominant
   environmental variable associated with moth richness, while temperature,
   contrary to our predictions, is an unexpectedly weak predictor. This is
   in stark contrast to the importance we identify for temperature as a
   niche variable of individual species. Despite divergent life histories,
   both main sub-groups of moths exhibit these relationships. Tribal-level
   deconstruction of richness and climatic niche patterns indicate
   idiosyncratic effects of biogeographic history for some of the less
   species-rich tribes, which in some cases exhibit distinct richness peaks
   away from the tropics. The study confirms, for a diverse insect group,
   overall richness associations of remarkable similarity to those
   documented for vertebrates and highlights the significant within-taxon
   structure that underpins emergent macroecological patterns. Results do
   not, however, meet predictions from vertebratederived hypotheses on how
   thermoregulation affects the strength of temperature-richness effects.
   Our study thus broadens the taxonomic focus in this data-deficient
   discourse. Our procedures of processing incomplete, scattered
   distribution data are a template for application to other taxa and
   regions.},

Abstract = {South African giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) have been
   introduced as an extralimital species to private farms in the Little
   Karoo on the basis of economic sustainability, and the need to create a
   competitive tourism product. However, little is known about the
   medium-to long-term impacts and ecological sustainability of such
   introductions. The diet of a population of giraffe on Sanbona Wildlife
   Reserve, near the town of Ladismith, was assessed via direct

   their potential impact on the world's most species-rich semi-desert, the
   Succulent Karoo. Unlike giraffe in their native range, the Sanbona
   population showed seasonal preference for browse species. Acacia karroo
   (sweet thorn) appears to be the preferred browse species during autumn
   and spring, with Schotia afra being the preferred species in winter, and
   no significant preference being shown in summer. Giraffe also appeared
   to seasonally move between catchments where tree species other than A.
   karroo occurs, especially during winter and spring when the tributaries
   of the Brak River, containing mixed Acacia with S. afra (karoo
   boer-bean) and Euclea undulata (small-leaved guarri), were visited with
   increasing frequency. These results largely confirm the importance of A.
   karroo as the main browse species in this environment but also suggest
   that other species may be important components of the diet of
   extralimital giraffe in the Little Karoo. On farms where A. karroo is
   dominant, supplementary feed may be needed when A. karroo browse is
   unavailable due to leaf drop.
   Conservation implications: Acacia karroo was the main browse species of
   extralimital G. c. giraffa at Sanbona Wildlife Reserve, but it switched
   to S. afra during winter. This suggests that an assessment of
   alternative food species forms part of suitability assessments for the
   introduction of extralimital G. c. giraffa for areas similar to Sanbona.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Many factors, including the inner status of the individuals and external
   environment, can influence the parasite infections and stress physiology
   in mammals. Here, we explored the influence of the sex, age,
   reproductive season and seasonal food availability on the parasitism and
   stress physiology in wild giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) through
   nutrient and steroid hormone analysis and parasitic infection
   measurement. Diet composition had significant influences on the faecal
   cortisol levels and parasite load of wild giant pandas. The seasonal
   dynamic of the cortisol levels and parasite load in faeces co-vary with
   the seasonal nutrient intake levels of the pandas, which concurrently
   arrived the peaks at the wood bamboo shoot-eating period in May
   (parasite infection intensity, 41.47 +/- 12.11 eggs/g of wet faeces;
   cortisol levels, 619.34 +/- 70.55 ng/g dry faeces) that the nutrition
   intake by wild pandas was the highest (protein/fibre, 69.23 +/- 9.93).
   Meanwhile, age class is also as an important factor to affect the
   parasite load and stress physiology of wild giant pandas. Cubs and
   sub-adults suffered more helminth burden and stress physiology than
   adults and old individuals. This is the first study to evaluate the
   inner and external factors influence on parasitism and stress physiology
   in wild giant pandas. The findings facilitate a better understanding of
   how environmental factors might influence the physiology, behaviour and
   health of pandas and other species and have implications for the
   conservation and management of the endangered species.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Short-lived, fast-growing species that contribute greatly to global
   capture fisheries are sensitive to fluctuations in the environment.
   Uncertainties in exact stock-environment relationships have meant that
   environmental variability and extremes have been difficult to integrate
   directly into fisheries management. We applied a management strategy
   evaluation approach for one of Australia's large prawn stocks to test
   the robustness of harvest control rules to environmental variability.
   The model ensemble included coupled environmental-population models and
   an alternative catchability scenario fitted to historical catch per unit
   effort data. We compared the efficacy of alternative management actions
   to conserve marine resources under a variable environment while
   accounting for fisher livelihoods. Model fits to catch per unit effort
   were reasonably good and similar across operating models (OMs). For
   models that were coupled to the environment, environmental parameters
   for El Nino years were estimated with good associated precision, and OM3
   had a lower AIC score (77.61) than the base model (OM1, 80.39), whereas
   OM2 (AIC 82.41) had a similar AIC score, suggesting the OMs were all
   plausible model alternatives. Our model testing resulted in a plausible
   subset of management options, and stakeholders selected a permanent
   closure of the first fishing season based on overall performance of this
   option; ability to reduce the risk of fishery closure and stock
   collapse; robustness to uncertainties; and ease of implementation. Our
   simulation approach enabled the selection of an optimal yet pragmatic
   solution for addressing economic and conservation objectives under a
   variable environment with extreme events.},

Title = {Range edges of North American marine species are tracking temperature
   over decades},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {13},
Pages = {3145-3156},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of species range edges in the modern era is
   key to addressing fundamental biogeographic questions about abiotic and
   biotic drivers of species distributions. Range edges are where
   colonization and extirpation processes unfold, and so these dynamics are
   also important to understand for effective natural resource management
   and conservation. However, few studies to date have analyzed time series
   of range edge positions in the context of climate change, in part
   because range edges are difficult to detect. We first quantified
   positions for 165 range edges of marine fishes and invertebrates from
   three U.S. continental shelf regions using up to five decades of survey
   data and a spatiotemporal model to account for sampling and measurement
   variability. We then analyzed whether those range edges maintained their
   edge thermal niche-the temperatures found at the range edge
   position-over time. A large majority of range edges (88\%) maintained
   either summer or winter temperature extremes at the range edge over the
   study period, and most maintained both (76\%), although not all of those
   range edges shifted in space. However, we also found numerous range
   edges-particularly poleward edges and edges in the region that
   experienced the most warming-that did not shift at all, shifted further
   than predicted by temperature alone, or shifted opposite the direction
   expected, underscoring the multiplicity of factors that drive changes in
   range edge positions. This study suggests that range edges of temperate
   marine species have largely maintained the same edge thermal niche
   during periods of rapid change and provides a blueprint for testing
   whether and to what degree species range edges track temperature in
   general.},

Title = {The measurement of ecosystem development in Caribbean coral reefs
   through topological indices},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {110},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The exploration of gradients of development stages of coral reef
   ecosystems is a subject poorly studied, especially when they exhibit
   multiple degrees of geomorphological or structural development or both.
   The objective of the present work was to study the gradient of
   functional and structural maturity of the Mexican Caribbean coral reefs
   (CM). Here we analyzed three geomorphological zones that cover a
   gradient of 400 km in length in order to obtain coral reefs with
   different geomorphologies. Thirteen reefs were selected, for which 12
   ecosystem development attributes and five topological indices were
   analyzed. The development attributes of coral reefs were estimated from
   trophic models constructed using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE), while the
   topological indices were calculated from the predator-prey matrix
   obtained from each EwE model. Through a partial redundancy analysis
   (RDA) seven of the 12 development attributes (ascendency, overhead,
   development capacity, net primary production, ascendency/development
   capacity, overhead/development capacity and richness of functional
   group) were selected due their low or null collinearity. Using the
   developmental attributes selected in a nonmetric multidimensional
   scaling (stress: 0.1) and analysis of similarities (r global: 0.828 and
   p: 0.001), we found a gradient of maturity that increases from north to
   south, i.e., northern coral reefs (e.g. Puerto Morelos) are less mature
   than southern coral reefs (e.g. Mahahual). On other hand, through a
   non-parametric ANOVA and a partial redundancy analysis (first axis:
   F-ratio = 62.054, p = 0.012; second axis: F-ratio = 1.591, p = 0.014;
   100\% of the total variance explained by the first two canonical axes)
   we detected that topological indices respond to development stages, in
   this way the control flow increases with the maturity while the
   intermediation, number of connections and number of interactions
   depredator-prey are inverse to maturity; therefore, topological indices
   can be used to describe development stages. The determination of a
   gradient of maturity in MC coral reefs should be considered in
   management and conservation policies, therefore different strategies
   must be implemented in ecosystems, because resilience and ecosystem
   response depend on them.},

Abstract = {Marine molluscs are sold all over the world as curios and souvenirs.
   This market encompasses about 5,000 species of molluscs (bivalves and
   gastropods) worldwide, but the mollusc species involved in this trade
   are undocumented in all but a very small number of countries. The
   present study provides a baseline assessment of the mollusc species used
   in the manufacture of crafts, marine curiosities and souvenirs in
   northeastern Brazil. A total of 126 species (41 bivalves and 85
   gastropods) were found to be sold individually as decorative pieces or
   incorporated into utilitarian objects. Overall, the families most
   represented were Veneridae bivalves (9 species) and the gastropods
   Conidae and Strombidae (8 species each). Large gastropod shells were
   observed in all of the localities surveyed (mainly as part of table
   lamps). The main species used were the King helmet Cassis tuberosa, the
   Hebrew volute Voluta ebraea, and the Goliath conch Eustrombus goliath.
   The majority of the species involved are harvested from the Atlantic
   Ocean (68\%), but many are imported from Indo-Pacific countries, such as
   cowries Monetaria moneta. Among the species harvested in the Atlantic
   Ocean, 11.2\% are endemic to Brazil as, for example, the Brazilian chank
   (Turbinella laevigata). The majority of the species sold in northeastern
   Brazil tend to inhabit shallow habitats, which facilitates their
   capture. As there are no official statistics available concerning the
   marine curio and souvenir trade in Brazil, some species may be
   endangered. Harvesting regulations should include minimum capture sizes,
   capture quotas, specific periods for harvesting, and the use of
   non-destructive techniques.},

Title = {Landscape complexity and elevation affect the effectiveness of a local
   pest-management practice},

Abstract = {Farm-scale diversification practices have been proposed as a means to
   enhance crop protection, primarily by increasing the presence of
   beneficial arthropods. The effectiveness of diversification is often
   context-dependent. Diversification is typically most effective in
   simplified landscapes dominated by agricultural land, which tend to have
   a scarce natural enemy community. However, in some diversification
   practices such as `push-pull' systems, the primary goal is to change the
   behavior of pests through stimuli that repel (or push) the pest away
   from the crop, while pulling them toward a trap crop (pull). In such
   cases where pest control is not dependent on the presence of natural
   enemies, but on the manipulation of the pest's behavior, it is unclear
   if local management practices are context-dependent. We tested if the
   effectiveness of a push-pull practice in a potato cropping system for
   decreasing pest damage and increasing crop yield depends on the
   landscape context. We chose 14 Andean potato farms that varied in the
   proportion of cropland at a 1 km radius scale. At each farm, we
   established one control and one push-pull plot and measured pest damage
   and yield. Our results show that the effectiveness of the push-pull
   practice was dependent on the pest pressure on the farm, the landscape
   context, and elevation. The higher the pest pressure on a farm, the more
   effective the push-pull system was at increasing yield and reducing
   pests, but only in complex landscapes. In simple landscapes, there was
   no benefit of using the push-pull system and the tendency was decreased
   yields relative to control systems. Interestingly, elevation also played
   an important role in affecting the effectiveness of the push-pull
   practice. At higher elevations, the push-pull system was more effective
   at reducing pests and increasing yields. Our results suggest that under
   circumstances that are more challenging for herbivores, such as higher
   elevation or landscapes with fewer host crops, behavior-modifying
   management practices are more effective at increasing yields. We suggest
   that while diversification practices based on top-down control (e.g.
   flowering strips) could be recommended for growers in simple or
   intermediate landscapes, diversification practices such as push-pull
   that are based on behavior modification may be more appropriate to
   increase productivity in complex landscapes. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Abstract = {Earth System Models project that global climate change will reduce ocean
   net primary production (NPP), upper trophic level biota biomass and
   potential fisheries catches in the future, especially in the eastern
   equatorial Pacific. However, projections from Earth System Models are
   undermined by poorly constrained assumptions regarding the biological
   cycling of iron, which is the main limiting resource for NPP over large
   parts of the ocean. In this study, we show that the climate change
   trends in NPP and the biomass of upper trophic levels are strongly
   affected by modifying assumptions associated with phytoplankton iron
   uptake. Using a suite of model experiments, we find 21st century climate
   change impacts on regional NPP range from -12.3\% to +2.4\% under a high
   emissions climate change scenario. This wide range arises from
   variations in the efficiency of iron retention in the upper ocean in the
   eastern equatorial Pacific across different scenarios of biological iron
   uptake, which affect the strength of regional iron limitation. Those
   scenarios where nitrogen limitation replaced iron limitation showed the
   largest projected NPP declines, while those where iron limitation was
   more resilient displayed little future change. All model scenarios have
   similar skill in reproducing past inter-annual variations in regional
   ocean NPP, largely due to limited change in the historical period.
   Ultimately, projections of end of century upper trophic level biomass
   change are altered by 50\%-80\% across all plausible scenarios. Overall,
   we find that uncertainties in the biological iron cycle cascade through
   open ocean pelagic ecosystems, from plankton to fish, affecting their
   evolution under climate change. This highlights additional challenges to
   developing effective conservation and fisheries management policies
   under climate change.},

Title = {Estimated bycatch of harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in two coastal

   conservation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {161},

Abstract = {Using data collected during 2006-2008 from a monitored segment (18
   vessels) of the Norwegian coastal fleet (vessels <15 m) of gillnetters
   targeting monkfish and cod, we used general additive models (GAMs) to
   derive bycatch rates of harbour porpoise. These bycatch rates were then
   applied to fishery catch data on the target species to estimate the
   total number of porpoise taken by the coastal gillnet fisheries. The two
   best models estimated bycatches of 20,719 and 20,989 porpoises during
   2006-2008, with CVs 36\% and 27\%, respectively. Thus, about 6900
   harbour porpoises are taken annually in the coastal monkfish and cod
   gillnet fisheries. Although no abundance estimate is available for the
   coastal harbour porpoise population, this annual bycatch is likely not
   sustainable according to the management objectives defined by ASCOBANS.
   In the cod gillnet fishery, harbour porpoise bycatch rates decreased
   rapidly with increasing depth to 50 m and then levelled off. In the
   monkfish gillnet fishery, bycatch rates decreased linearly with
   increasing depth throughout the depth range fished. To reduce harbour
   porpoise bycatches, we recommend that large mesh nets associated with
   the monkfish fishery to be prohibited at depths less than 50 m. We also
   recommend to conduct experiments using Acoustic Deterrent Devices (ADDS
   or `pingers') on nets set deeper than 50 m. If these devices prove
   successful in reducing porpoise bycatch, we propose that ADDs should be
   implemented in the Norwegian coastal gillnet fisheries for cod and
   monkfish. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The use of bdelloids in reference to rotifer biocoenotic indices as an
   indicator of the ecological state of small field water bodies: The
   effect of macrophytes, shading and trophic state of water},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {576-583},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Species identification of many rotifers is very difficult due to e.g.
   body contraction in the preserved material. In the case of bdelloids, it
   is even more problematic as they can only be determined when alive.
   Therefore, a necessity for developing a method of using the class
   Bdelloidea for environmental analyses arose, so I examined them as a
   whole group. This is an approach that reduces extensive, time-consuming
   and particularly difficult taxonomic identification of certain species.
   The occurrence of bdelloids against various rotifer community indices in
   a mosaic of habitats of 220 small water bodies in an agricultural
   landscape was subjected to both abiotic and biotic factors so as to
   measure the extent of their reaction and the possibility of their usage
   in the assessment of environmental conditions. Despite their preference
   for forest ponds, bdelloids were also a very common and abundant element
   of field aquatic ecosystems. Due to their specific sensitivity bdelloids
   serve as a valuable ecological indicator which can be used for
   environmental assessment of habitat quality in small water bodies in the
   agricultural landscape and also for monitoring appropriate conservation
   actions for ponds. Bdelloids are typically macrophyte-associated
   organisms, selectively choosing Phragmites stands, a transitional area
   between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Their response to the
   environment was similar to the littoral fraction and rotifer diversity
   indices, which were found to be in opposition to the eutrophic community
   associated with the open water area in large-surfaced fish ponds.
   Moreover, the increase in bdelloids in ponds of low human impact
   supports their potential for the diagnosis of natural ponds of low
   transformation level. Their preference towards ponds with an increasing
   layer of nymphaeids and pleustophytes also supports their role in
   diagnosing good quality waters as floating-leaved macrophytes are known
   to improve water quality. It is recommended that bdelloids as a group
   can be used for the determination of the level of heterogeneity
   (connected with macrophyte occurrence) and the level of shade (generated
   by macrophyte cover) as well as the water quality state of small water
   bodies.},

Title = {Development of a comprehensive mangrove quality index (MQI) in Matang
   Mangrove: Assessing mangrove ecosystem health},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {103-117},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Mangroves are multi-functional ecosystems providing resource provisions
   and various ecosystem services, all of which are critical to the local
   livelihood and national economy. However, unsustainable anthropogenic
   activities continue to undermine the health of these ecosystems
   resulting in environmental adversities and declining resources. This
   study aimed to formulate a Mangrove Quality Index (MQI) which took into
   consideration the mangrove forest, contributing components of a mangrove
   forest, soil, surrounding marine ecosystem, hydrology and the
   socio-economic variables. Three major sites representing the least,
   moderately and most-disturbed mangrove ecosystems in Matang, Malaysia
   were selected. These areas were used to assess the contribution of 43
   variables from five categories, namely, mangrove biotic integrity,
   mangrove soil, marine-mangrove, mangrove hydrology, and mangrove
   socio-economic factors. Two types of indices were developed to indicate
   the status of each category, 1) Mangrove Quality Index for a specific
   category (MQISi) and, 2) Overall MQI to reflect the overall health
   status of the ecosystem. The indices for the five different categories
   were Mangrove Biotic Integrity Index (MQIS1), Mangrove Soil Index
   (MQIS(2)), Marine-Mangrove Index (MQIS3), Mangrove-Hydrology Index
   (MQIS4) and Mangrove-Socio-economic Index (MQIS(5)). Using Principle
   Component Analysis, ten variables representing all the five categories
   were selected to formulate the overall MQI. They are aboveground
   biomass, crab abundance, soil carbon, soil nitrogen, number of
   phytoplankton species, number of diatom species, dissolved oxygen,
   turbidity, education level, and time spent fishing. We developed the
   overall MQI based on the total score obtained from each category. The
   health status of mangroves is ranked from 1 to 5 viz. 1 (worst), 2
   (bad), 3 (moderate), 4 (good), 5 (excellent). In the Matang Mangrove,
   the health status of the least disturbed area is ranked 5, moderate
   disturbed area is ranked 4, while the most disturbed area is ranked 2.
   The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) supported the overall
   MQI developed. The NDVI for the least disturbed area in Matang ranged
   from -0.689846 to 0.652204, for the moderately disturbed area, it ranged
   from -0.732508 to 0.638625, while the most disturbed area ranged from
   -0.916667 to 0.314991.},

Title = {Improved allometric proxies for eelgrass conservation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Current anthropogenic influences threaten the permanence of eelgrass, a
   relevant macrophyte that brings about important ecological benefits
   including nursery for waterfowl and fish species, shoreline
   stabilization, nutrient recycling and carbon sequestration. Eelgrass
   restoration normally involves transplanted plots and monitoring success
   requires noninvasive assessments of standing stock and productivity.
   Allometric scaling of eelgrass leaf biomass and length can provide
   proxies for these assessments, but accuracy of allometric projections is
   mainly resultant of uncertainty propagation of parameters, so for the
   sake of suitability it is very important ensuring the most accurate
   estimates. The traditional approach for producing estimates of
   allometric parameters considers a linear regression model involving
   logarithms of the original response and explanatory variables along with
   a normally distributed additive error. The suitability of this method
   has been questioned on the ground of biased results raising nonlinear
   regression as a necessary amendment. Here we demonstrate that this
   controversy can be surpassed allowing for a logistic error structure and
   heteroscedasticity in the traditional method. The present arrangement
   delivered parameter estimates from raw data surpassing inconveniences of
   the traditional fitting procedure. Moreover, associated allometric
   proxies for average leaf biomass in shoots entailed similar
   reproducibilities than produced by using nonlinear regression and
   quality controlled data. In achieving suitable accuracy levels, the
   present approach required a sample of raw data of about 9\% of involved
   in prior estimations based on quality controlled data. The improvements
   associated to the present approach grant highly consistent
   non-destructive assessments for the sake of eelgrass conservation.},

Title = {Assessing the vulnerability of demersal elasmobranchs to a data-poor
   shrimp trawl fishery in Costa Rica, Eastern Tropical Pacific},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {217},
Pages = {321-328},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The impact of shrimp trawl fisheries on slow-growing demersal sharks,
   skates and rays has been widely documented. Yet, a lack of catch records
   and biological information has hindered improvements in elasmobranch
   bycatch management, particularly in tropical regions. When information
   is scarce, data-poor methods can be valuable tools to guide the
   management and conservation of vulnerable marine taxa. Here we combined
   an Ecological Risk Assessment commonly used in data-deficient fisheries
   (Productivity Susceptibility Analysis or PSA) with a spatial analysis
   (Hotspot Analysis) to (i) identify which elasmobranch species are most
   vulnerable to the Costa Rican shrimp trawl fishery, and (ii) locate
   areas and seasons with high concentrations of vulnerable elasmobranchs.
   According to the results of our PSA, the scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna
   lewini), prickly shark (Echinorhinus cookei), and long-tail stingray
   (Hypanus longus) were the most vulnerable species, while the least
   vulnerable species were small batoids of the Urotrygonidae family. We
   identified large information gaps, namely demographic parameter
   estimates and long-term bycatch trends. Spatial aggregations of
   vulnerable elasmobranchs occurred near highly productive estuaries and
   coastal habitats, especially at depths of 50-100 m. Based on our
   findings, PSA and Hotspot analyses can be powerful tools to identify
   spatial areas where trawl fishing grounds overlap with the habitat of
   vulnerable bycatch species, and thus can be used to design spatial
   trawling closures that protect species at risk. We therefore conclude
   that our methodological approach may aid in the implementation of
   ecosystem-based fisheries management in data-poor situations.},

Title = {Convergence of stakeholders' environmental threat perceptions following

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Managing human use of ecosystems in an era of rapid environmental change
   requires an understanding of diverse stakeholders' behaviors and
   perceptions to enable effective prioritization of actions to mitigate
   multiple threats. Specifically, research examining how threat
   perceptions are shared or diverge among stakeholder groups and how these
   can evolve through time is increasingly important. We investigated
   environmental threat perceptions related to Australia's Great Barrier
   Reef and explored their associations before and after consecutive years
   of mass coral bleaching. We used data from surveys of commercial
   fishers, tourism operators, and coastal residents (n = 5254) conducted
   in 2013 and 2017. Threats perceived as most serious differed
   substantially among groups before bleaching but were strongly aligned
   after bleaching. Climate change became the most frequently reported
   threat by all stakeholder groups following the coral bleaching events,
   and perceptions of fishing and poor water quality as threats also ranked
   high. Within each of the 3 stakeholder groups, fishers, tourism
   operators, and coastal residents, the prioritization of these 3 threats
   tended to diverge in 2013, but convergence occurred after bleaching.
   These results indicate an emergence of areas of agreement both within
   and across stakeholder groups. Changes in perceptions were likely
   influenced by high-profile environmental-disturbance events and media
   representations of threats. Our results provide insights into the
   plasticity of environmental-threat perceptions and highlight how their
   convergence in response to major events may create new opportunities for
   strategic public engagement and increasing support for management.},

Title = {Youth Experiences with Wildlife During a Period of Significant Cultural
   Change in Laikipia, Kenya},
Journal = {HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {133-146},
Abstract = {In Laikipia, Kenya, youth are increasingly likely to attend school and
   less likely to spend time in the landscape as pastoralists when compared
   with preceding generations. A possible unintended outcome of this
   transition is a change in how youth experience and relate to wildlife.
   This article addressed the research question: How do youth in Laikipia
   experience wildlife? When asked to share an essay about a personal
   experience with wildlife, most of the respondents recalled negative
   direct experiences that involved human-wildlife conflict. Negative
   emotions were expressed more often than positive emotions. Since these
   experiences may contribute to an overall attitude about wildlife, the
   result is potentially troubling. This paradoxical outcome of greater
   access to education and less time spent in the landscape may lead to a
   future generation of decision-makers with an ambivalent or negative
   attitude toward wildlife.},

Title = {Crop vegetation structure is more important than crop type in
   determining where Lesser Kestrels forage},
Journal = {BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {438-452},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We studied foraging habitat selection by Lesser Kestrel Falco naumanni
   throughout the breeding period in south-west Spain by means of transects
   on which foraging observations were recorded. We focused on the effects
   of habitat and crop type, but also on the effect of vegetation structure
   and the presence of agricultural activities in the field on Lesser
   Kestrel use. We considered both the accumulated use of the foraging area
   during the breeding season and the instantaneous foraging habitat
   selection by kestrels. Foraging habitat selection was highly dynamic
   following crop development and agricultural activities. Almost all major
   arable crop types showed positive selection during some part of the
   breeding cycle. Accumulated use by kestrels demonstrated positive
   associations with wheat and cotton fields and negative selection of
   permanent habitat types, such as forested areas, woody crops and
   built-up areas that have no prey or are not used by the species due to
   unfavourable structure. Vegetation structure appears to play a major
   role in instantaneous foraging selection. Lesser Kestrels select fields
   with short vegetation and intermediate cover. They also forage on field
   margins and where agricultural activities such as ploughing or
   harvesting that facilitate access to prey are being conducted. Our
   results help to clarify apparent controversies among previous studies on
   the subject, highlighting the importance of the heterogeneity of
   agricultural landscapes around colonies (crops at different growth
   stages which provide variable vegetation height and cover during the
   breeding cycle) and the effect that agricultural activities have on
   facilitating access to prey. Beyond the species-specific approach, our
   work encourages further studies on habitat selection by farmland birds
   to account not only for human-based categorisation of habitats (e.g.
   crop type) but also on objective measures such as vegetation height and
   cover that influence access to prey and better reflect the high dynamism
   of agricultural landscapes.
   Resumen Se estudio la seleccion del habitat de caza del cernicalo
   primilla Falco naumanni a lo largo del ciclo reproductivo en el suroeste
   de Espana mediante transectos en los que se registro el comportamiento
   de los individuos observados. Se evaluo el efecto de los usos del suelo,
   tipo de cultivo, estructura de la vegetacion y presencia de actividades
   agricolas en el uso acumulado y la seleccion instantanea del habitat de
   caza de los cernicalos. La seleccion del habitat de caza demostro ser
   muy dinamica en funcion del desarrollo de los cultivos y las actividades
   agricolas. Casi todos los cultivos herbaceos mostraron una seleccion
   positiva por parte de los cernicalos en algun momento del ciclo
   reproductivo. El uso acumulado mostro relaciones positivas con el trigo
   y el algodon y una seleccion negativa de habitats o cultivos permanentes
   que o bien son pobres en presas o son rechazados por la especie por su
   estructura, como las areas forestales, los cultivos lenosos o las zonas
   urbanas. La estructura de la vegetacion parece que juega un papel
   preponderante en la seleccion instantanea del habitat de caza. Los
   cernicalos seleccionaron areas con vegetacion baja y con cobertura
   intermedia. Tambien cazaron sobre lindes y alli donde se estaban
   llevando a cabo actividades agricolas, como el arado o el cosechado, que
   facilitan el acceso a las presas. Nuestros resultados contribuyen a
   esclarecer las aparentes controversias entre estudios previos,
   subrayando la importancia de la heterogeneidad del paisaje agricola
   alrededor de las colonias (cultivos en diferentes estados de crecimiento
   que ofrecen variabilidad en la altura de la vegetacion y cobertura a lo
   largo de todo el ciclo reproductivo) asi como el efecto de las
   actividades agricolas que podrian estar facilitando el acceso a las
   presas por parte de los cernicalos. Mas alla de la aproximacion
   especifica, nuestro trabajo incentiva la utilizacion de variables
   objetivas como la altura y la cobertura de la vegetacion -en lugar de
   clasificaciones de interes humano como el tipo de cultivo- que reflejan
   mejor la disponibilidad de presas y el gran dinamismo estructural de los
   paisajes agricolas.},

Title = {Ranking matrices as operational tools for the environmental risk
   assessment of genetically modified crops on non-target organisms},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {367-381},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {For the operationalization of the structured, stepwise selection
   procedure for non-target testing organisms integrated into the new EFSA
   guidelines for environmental risk assessment of GM plants practical
   tools - i.e. ranking matrices - were developed. These tools - some of
   them are new and some are refined from older ones - were tested using
   the GM case crop of TC 1507 maize. The selection procedure consists of
   six steps. The strategy builds on identifying the important ecological
   functions for the particular cropping system and compiling a species
   lists according to their ecological functions and presence in the
   specific receiving environments. Subsequently, the species numbers are
   reduced in a systematic, stepwise fashion to a relevant and practical
   number of testing organisms and/or processes.
   Four ecological functional categories were selected: herbivory,
   pollination, natural enemies and soil organisms/processes. Based on
   these categories, the relevant species were chosen and subjected to the
   selection steps. Out of a total of 33 herbivores, 73 pollinators/pollen
   feeders, 48 natural enemies and 77 soil organisms/processes we started
   with in Step 1, 15 herbivores, 10 pollinators 17 natural enemy species
   and 9 soil organisms/processes were selected as relevant and suited for
   a testing program at the end of the selection procedure in Step 4.
   Although the ranking tools will continue to need further refinement, we
   could demonstrate that this procedure allows to swiftly select the most
   important suite of species and processes from a large number of
   organisms. This expert-driven process increases ecological realism and
   transparency in risk assessment and tailors it to the particular
   receiving environment, thus, overcoming important deficiencies of the
   current approach that has attracted persistent criticism. We recommend
   balancing ecological requirements with practicability criteria and
   realism in the test strategy. At present, the ranking is
   abundance-oriented and, thus, excludes rare and/or endangered species
   that are sensitive to disturbances. We suggest additional selection
   criteria to strengthen nature conservation and off-field aspects. (C)

Title = {Different drivers, common mechanism; the distribution of a reef fish is
   restricted by local-scale oxygen and temperature constraints on aerobic
   metabolism},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {The distributions of ectothermic marine organisms are limited to
   temperature ranges and oxygen conditions that support aerobic
   respiration, quantified within the metabolic index (f) as the ratio of
   oxygen supply to metabolic oxygen demand. However, the utility of f at
   local scales and across heterogenous environments is unknown; yet, these
   scales are often where actionable management decisions are made. Here,
   we test if f can delimit the entire distribution of marine organisms
   when calibrated across an appropriate temperature range and at local
   scales (similar to 10 km) using the endemic reef fish, Chrysoblephus
   laticeps, which is found in the highly heterogenous temperature and
   oxygen environment along the South African coastal zone, as a model
   species. In laboratory experiments, we find a bidirectional (at 12
   degrees C) hypoxia tolerance response across the temperature range
   tested (8 to 24 degrees C), permitting a piecewise calibration of phi.
   We then project this calibrated f model through temperature and oxygen
   data from a high spatial resolution (11 to 13 km) ocean model for the
   periods 2005 to 2009 and 2095 to 2099 to quantify various magnitudes of
   phi across space and time paired with complementary C. laticeps
   occurrence points. Using random forest species distribution models, we
   quantify a critical phi value of 2.78 below which C. laticeps cannot
   persist and predict current and future distributions of C. laticeps in
   line with already observed distribution shifts of other South African
   marine species. Overall, we find that C. laticeps' distribution is
   limited by increasing temperatures towards its warm edge but by low
   oxygen availability towards its cool edge, which is captured within phi
   at fine scales and across heterogenous oxygen and temperature
   combinations. Our results support the application of phi for generating
   local- and regional-scale predictions of climate change effects on
   organisms that can inform local conservation management decisions.},

Abstract = {This study aims to reconstruct the historical spatiotemporal
   distribution of the anadromous sturgeons, Acipenser sturio and A.
   oxyrinchus, in NW-Europe (especially in the Rhine, Meuse, Scheldt, and
   Ems rivers, and in the North Sea), in light of evaluating the
   possibilities for their reintroduction. It is based on fisheries data
   from the 14th-twentieth century, consisting of > 5000 records of
   sturgeon landings and sales (c. 40,000 specimens) from the Netherlands,
   Belgium, Germany, Luxemburg, France and Switzerland. Most data originate
   from fisheries in the Rhine-Meuse delta (c. 28,000 specimens, 98\% of
   the Rhine catches). Further upstream, far fewer sturgeons (c. 600
   specimens) were reported from the Rhine's mainstem and its principal
   tributaries, Mosel, Neckar and Main. Smaller tributaries and the Ems,
   Meuse, and Scheldt rivers seldom yielded sturgeons. This spatial pattern
   can be related to the species' preference for large-river habitat,
   combined with fisheries activities that were most intensive in the delta
   areas. Sturgeon catches began to dwindle in the late nineteenth century,
   at a time when river engineering first strongly affected the sturgeon's
   reproductive habitats in the Lower Rhine and delta areas. Also from then
   onwards, North Sea fishery pressure increased, as trawlers switched from
   sail to steam-powered propulsion. These sea fisheries harvested all
   age-classes of sturgeons year-round, including populations from other
   European rivers. The outcomes strongly suggest that NW-European sturgeon
   populations were initially impacted by intensive river fisheries, but
   especially by destruction of reproductive habitat, due to river
   regulation, and an intensified North Sea fishery, ultimately resulting
   in total population collapse.},

Title = {Street lighting delays and disrupts the dispersal of Atlantic salmon
   (Salmo salar) fry},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {140-146},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {There has been a decline in the abundance of Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar) despite significant conservation measures designed to reduce
   fishing mortality. Populations at the southern edge of their historical
   distribution, where anthropogenic impacts on the freshwater environment
   may be greater, have suffered the largest decline. In this
   investigation, we compared the timing of Atlantic salmon fry dispersal
   from incubators in an aquarium under control and ecologically relevant
   broad spectrum street-lit conditions (median night light intensity=12
   lx). Fry dispersal occurred 2.8 days later (F=82.9, df=1,8, p<0.001),
   and on average the fry were smaller at dispersal (0.017 g, se=0.0012, p
   < 0.001, n=730), in the incubators exposed to street lighting.
   Significant disruption to the diel pattern of fry dispersal was also
   observed. Dispersal under control conditions was significantly directed
   around a mean time of 4:17 h after dusk (p<0.001, r=0.76, n=1990) with
   very few fry (<2\%) dispersing during daylight hours. Under street
   lighting, the dispersal of fry was significantly delayed (mean time 6:38
   h after dusk; p<0.001, r=039, n=2413) with a significant proportion
   (32\%) dispersing during daylight hours. Survival to dispersal in the
   controlled aquarium conditions was not lower under street-lit conditions
   (p=0.21, n=5000 eggs across 10 incubators). However, in the wild, the
   period between fry emergence and the establishment of feeding
   territories is considered to be of critical importance in the dynamics
   of salmonid populations and any disruption may reduce fitness. Crown

Abstract = {Preferences for landscapes are critical because they can drive landscape
   changes over time. The mediating role of wildlife value orientations in
   influencing preferences for urban wetlands through the provision of
   ecological information (based on insectivorous bats) was experimentally
   tested. Residents (N = 198) were asked about their preferences for
   wetlands, as depicted in 27 photographs. Half of the participants were
   provided with ecological information. Urban wetlands of high habitat
   quality for bats were preferred by both groups. There was a significant
   influence of ecological information on preference, although
   unexpectedly, this was on wetlands of low quality habitat; people who
   received ecological information had lower preferences for wetlands that
   provided lower quality habitat for bats. This influence was mediated by
   wildlife value orientations (wildlife rights and recreational wildlife
   experiences). Results suggest that preferences for landscapes can be
   influenced by providing information that is consistent with value
   orientations.},

Abstract = {Limited research has examined landowner acceptance of using incentives
   for managing wildlife (e.g., compensation schemes). We examined
   acceptance of strategies for managing beaver impacts, use of incentives
   to protect habitat and retain beavers on private property, and how
   responses differed by impact severity, residential location, and
   experiences with beavers. Data were obtained from surveys of landowners
   in four regions of Oregon (n = 1,204). Education about how to coexist
   with beavers was the most acceptable management response across six
   impact scenarios (e.g., beaver chews trees, floods buildings). Lethal
   control was unacceptable across all scenarios. As impacts increased,
   leaving beavers alone became unacceptable and removing dams became
   acceptable. Irrespective of impact, landowners would be more likely to
   use incentives (e.g., financial compensation) than remove beavers.
   Landowners in Eastern Oregon and those who experienced impacts would be
   less likely to use incentives and considered aggressive strategies
   (e.g., removing dams, lethal control) more acceptable.},

Abstract = {Changes in hormones of black-necked crane during different reproductive
   stages.
   Black-necked cranes (Grus nigricollis) are national first-level
   protected wild animals in China. Artificial breeding has been adopted by
   many zoos and reserves to achieve ex-situ conservation of black-necked
   cranes, but the breeding rate of the species in cages is low. This study
   used non-invasive methods combined with behavioural observations to
   investigate changes in sex hormones and glucocorticoid metabolites in
   the droppings of black-necked cranes during the breeding cycle, with the
   results showing that (i) levels of estradiol and testosterone in
   black-necked cranes increased significantly when they entered the
   breeding period, and these levels could be used as an important
   physiological indicator to effectively monitor the physiological status
   of females and males during the reproductive period, thus providing a
   theoretical basis for the timing of semen collection; (ii) the level of
   progesterone in the mid-reproduction stage was significantly higher than
   that in other stages in female black-necked cranes after successful
   mating, and this level could be an effective indicator of the mating
   status of female black-necked cranes; (iii) droppings' glucocorticoid
   metabolites in the breeding period showed different dynamics between
   paired and singly caged black-necked cranes, indicating that the
   physiological phenomenon of reproduction could result in a certain
   amount of physiological burden on black-necked cranes. These results
   provide a theoretical basis for the selection of physiological
   parameters in the artificial breeding of black-necked cranes.},

Title = {Identifying the source and accessing the spatial variations,

   the river waters of Sunderban biosphere reserve, India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {This study emphasizes on identification of source and accessing the
   spatial variation of dissolved heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn)
   in the rivers of Sundarban Biosphere Reserve India, the UNESCO world
   heritage site. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), PCA (Principal Component
   Analysis) as well as FA (Factor Analysis) are used for assessing the
   significant difference in means of metals concentration among the sites
   and understanding the sources of these pollutants. Three principal
   components with cumulative variance of 32, 55, and 73 \%, show that Pb,
   Ni and Cd are closely associated with each other indicating an
   anthropogenic origin of these metals. Heavy metal evaluation index (HEI)
   values indicate that areas close to densely populated sites are affected
   by elevated metals concentration due to anthropogenic activities. The
   ratio between the concentration of Cd, Ni and Pb in sites and the
   maximum respective permissible limit for these metals for conserved
   habitat is Log(10) normalized to understand the threats of these
   pollutants over the distributaries of Sundarbans. Pb pollution is
   prevalent in the areas that rely on the fossil fuel-operated boats, for
   transport, whereas higher Cd concentration is found in the areas
   dependent on rechargeable batteries to meet their energy demand. So
   these anthropogenic activities and mal-practices may be responsible for
   the heavy metal pollution in this region. The study concludes that
   gradual increase in metal pollution in river water due to anthropogenic
   activities, particularly Pb and Cd, could have a negative impact on the
   conserved flora and fauna of this ecosystem.},

Title = {Tarangire revisited: Consequences of declining connectivity in a
   tropical ungulate population},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {197},
Pages = {53-60},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The hyper-abundance of migratory wildlife in many ecosystems depends on
   maintaining access to seasonally available resources. In Eastern and
   Southern Africa, land-use change and a loss of connectivity have
   coincided with widespread declines in the abundance and geographic range
   of ungulate populations. Using photographic capture-mark-recapture, we
   examine the historical pattern of loss of connectivity and its impact on
   population trends in a partially migratory wildebeest population in
   northern Tanzania. To estimate abundance, we use a novel modeling
   approach that overcomes bias associated with photo misidentifications.
   Our data indicate (1) diminished connectivity within and between
   seasonal areas as a result of human activities, (2) a reduction in the
   overall population size compared to historical numbers, with high
   variability over time, (3) the continued use of highly constrained
   movement corridors between the three main seasonal ranges, (4) higher
   recruitment in the non-migratory subpopulation (Lake Manyara National
   Park) than in other areas of the ecosystem, and (5) an increase in the
   relative abundance of resident to migrant wildebeest. Recent
   conservation efforts to protect seasonal habitat and to enforce
   anti-poaching policies outside protected areas have likely helped
   stabilize the population, at least temporarily, but we caution that
   several key vulnerabilities remain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Social acceptance is crucial to reintroduction projects involving large
   felids, yet few studies have assessed public attitudes toward
   reintroduction candidates prior to release. To assess attitudes toward
   clouded leopards, a reintroduction candidate in Taiwan, we conducted
   interviews with 263 rural indigenous locals in southern Taiwan and
   distributed an internet questionnaire to 500 Taiwanese urbanites. Rural
   and urban attitudes were 67\% and 76\% positive toward clouded leopards,
   respectively. Higher knowledge about clouded leopards, male respondents,
   and younger-aged respondents were positively correlated with rural
   attitudes toward clouded leopards. Comparably, an increase in knowledge,
   male respondents, and those with more household children were positively
   associated with urban attitudes. Additionally, 67\% of rural and 71\% of
   urban respondents exhibited positive attitudes toward clouded leopard
   competitors and prey in Taiwan, respectively. Our findings suggest that
   clouded leopard reintroduction may already be well-supported among
   members of Taiwanese indigenous nations and more broadly by the general

Title = {Landscape modeling of the potential natural vegetation of Santa Catalina
   Island, California},
Journal = {WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {78},
Number = {4},
Pages = {617-632},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The vegetation of Santa Catalina Island has been significantly
   transformed through a history of introduction of exotic plant species
   and disturbance by large introduced herbivores. Many of these
   disturbances have been reduced in recent decades, using measures such as
   carefully controlling the number of bison and removing cattle, sheep,
   feral pigs, and goats. The success of subsequent vegetation restoration
   actions depends on the choice of the right plant community for a
   location, which may not be obvious for an island with extensive areas
   dominated by exotic species. Environmental niche modeling is an approach
   to re-create the spatial distribution of habitat types for such a
   purpose. Such models, however, often require both presence and absence
   data to be meaningful, while in this scenario absence is misleading
   because it may reflect a long history of disturbance. Maximum entropy
   modeling is a technique to model species distributions with
   presence-only data that has been shown to produce accurate results. We
   used this modeling tool to model the environmental niche for distinct
   vegetation types, conceptualized as potential natural vegetation, on
   Catalina Island as a means to predict locations where restoration
   actions would be most successful and to predict potential natural
   vegetation prior to anthropogenic disturbance. Using an existing
   vegetation map, we extracted random points from within the polygons
   defining each native vegetation type. We then modeled the habitat
   suitability for each habitat using high-resolution environmental data
   that included elevation, aspect, hillshade, northeastness, slope, solar
   radiation, and topographic wetness index. The resulting models were
   combined to produce a map of potential natural vegetation. A 1977 map of
   potential natural vegetation included 4 vegetation types (woodland,
   chaparral, scrub, and grassland) to which we compared our results. Our
   new model of potential natural vegetation has high spatial complexity
   and high resolution. It also shows naturalistic responses to topography
   that are consistent with the broad patterns mapped in 1977 while
   providing fine-scale resolution to inform restoration efforts.},

Abstract = {Non-invasive endocrine monitoring is an important conservation tool
   frequently used to support the management of wildlife species.
   Investigating ovarian activity and pregnancy rates of free-ranging
   African elephants can enhance our knowledge about the physiology of this
   highly social and long-lived species. The utility of a new,
   field-friendly progestagen enzymeimmunoassay (EIA) method was tested by
   monitoring ovarian activity of 40 females in Addo Elephant National Park
   (AENP), South Africa. Fecal samples were collected opportunistically
   from known individuals (June 2007-September 2009) and fecal progestagen
   metabolites (FPM) were extracted in the field and analyzed on-site using
   a visual, qualitative EIA. Those results were compared to the laboratory
   quantitative EIA assessment of hormone concentrations in the U.S.
   Qualitative FPM concentrations were strongly correlated with
   quantitative concentrations (r(s) = 0.72). Fecal samples collected from
   pregnant elephants (n = 22) had significantly higher FPM concentrations
   than non-pregnant individuals, and month of gestation was the strongest
   predictor of FPM concentrations. Endocrine profiles suggested that five
   older females were no longer cycling normally. Simplified field
   endocrine techniques could transform endangered species research under
   field conditions and provide reliable and economical new tools for
   making sensible conservation management decisions based on real-time
   hormone results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Central to appropriate wildlife management is an effective monitoring
   program. Monitoring wildlife in urban environments offers unique
   challenges in the form of barriers, prohibited access and crime. It
   also, however, provides a unique opportunity to enlist residential
   communities in collecting data on distribution of a number of species.
   Opportunistic sightings data has its flaws, including the lack of data
   on species absences, and unequal sampling effort. Yet these data may
   still provide reliable information on the distribution of species and
   complement localized, hypothesis driven research. Where possible
   opportunistic sightings data should be validated against traditional
   methods to determine their value for long term monitoring programmes. We
   use Maxent to model citizen-reported sightings to determine whether
   sightings of Cape clawless otters (Aonyx capensis) can complement
   standardized river occupancy surveys to monitor an elusive, widely
   distributed species living within a fragmented urban/natural matrix. The
   drivers of otter presence and the predicted distribution of otters
   modelled from citizen sightings mirrored that provided by previously
   published results based on occupancy models in the same system, and
   highlighted further areas of suitable otter habitat and routes for
   dispersal. Involving citizens in the monitoring of the urban otter
   population complemented standardized occupancy surveys and provided
   additional benefits. In addition to alleviating the pressure on local
   authorities to allocate resources to routine monitoring, citizen
   involvement provides an opportunity to gather supplementary data on
   behaviour and/or threats to the species; shed light on the potential
   dispersal routes, and promote awareness and encourage coexistence with
   urban adapted wildlife.},

Abstract = {Caviar is among the world's most valuable wildlife products.
   Exploitation of sturgeon and paddlefish for the caviar trade has
   severely reduced abundance, and harvest of most species is regulated
   under CITES. International trade requires that importing nations verify
   the species source of caviars they receive; the US domestic trade has no
   such requirement. We report the results of forensic species
   identifications of US caviar imports from 1998 to 2008 and of US
   domestic market caviars from 1997 to 1998. Twelve species were
   identified overall and species origins were mislabeled three times as
   often among US domestic market caviars (14.7 \%) as among imports (4.9
   \%). Industry practices associated with the re-packaging of caviars for
   domestic markets and re-export from intermediate countries have created
   opportunities for the co-mingling of legitimate caviars with those from
   illegal, unreported and unregulated sources.},

Title = {Fragmentation of forest-steppe predicts functional community composition
   of wild bee and wasp communities},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Increased habitat fragmentation in natural areas is one of the causes of
   declining insect diversity and biomass globally. Wild bees and wasps and
   their ecosystem functions are not exceptions of the trend. To stop this
   trend, we need to increase our understanding of interactions between
   functional traits and the environment for better informing conservation
   and restoration. Therefore, we studied how habitat fragmentation (i.e.,
   connectivity, fragment size) and flower availability (abundance and
   species richness) affect functional traits of wild bees and wasps.
   Forest-steppe is a complex ecosystem ranging from far East of Asia to
   Eastern Central Europe, consisting of a mosaic of woody and herbaceous
   vegetation patches. We selected 30 natural forest-steppe fragments along
   a connectivity gradient in the Hungarian Great Plain region. The size of
   the selected fragments ranged between 0.16 and 6.88 ha. We collected
   wild bees and wasps with yellow pan traps. We selected four functional
   traits: social habit, body size, feeding preference, and nesting
   location and investigated them in relation to habitat connectivity,
   patch size, flower abundance and richness. We used RLQ ordination to
   analyse the pollinators' functional community composition. We found that
   habitat connectivity supported larger, eusocial and ground nesting wild
   bees. Fragment size was closely related to larvae feeding preference in
   both studied groups by positively affecting oligolectic bees and
   carnivore wasps. Additionally, higher abundance and species richness of
   flowers maintained polygolectic bees and solitary, ground-nesting wasps.
   In our study, we described for the first time the relationship between
   the functional traits and habitat fragmentation of wild bee and wasp
   communities in a natural forest-steppe habitat. Our findings suggest
   that improved knowledge about the response of functional traits of wild
   bee and wasp communities to habitat fragmentation will allow a better
   understanding and prediction of subsequent effects on ecosystem
   functioning. We conclude that a combination of large, high-quality and
   well-connected patches maintains specialist wild bee and wasp
   communities.},

Title = {Managing individual nests promotes population recovery of a top predator},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1418-1429},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {1. Threatened species are managed using diverse conservation tactics
   implemented at multiple scales ranging from protecting individuals, to
   populations, to entire species. Individual protection strives to promote
   recovery at the population- or species-level, although this is seldom
   evaluated.
   2. After decades of widespread declines, bald eagles, Haliaeetus
   leucocephalus, are recovering throughout their range due to legal
   protection and pesticide bans. However, like other raptors, their
   recovery remains threatened by human activities. Bald eagle nests are
   commonly managed using buffer zones to minimize human disturbance, but
   the benefits of this practice remain unquantified.
   3. Within Voyageurs National Park (VNP), Minnesota, USA, managers have
   monitored bald eagle populations for over 40 years, and since 1991, have
   protected at-risk nests from human disturbance using buffer zones (200
   and 400 m radius). We aimed to (1) quantify the recovery of bald eagles
   in VNP (1973-2016), and (2) provide a first-ever evaluation of the
   individual- and population-level effects of managing individual nests.
   To do so, we developed Bayesian Integrated Population Models combining
   observations of nest occupancy and reproductive output (metrics commonly
   collected for raptors) to estimate nest-level probabilities of
   occupancy, nest success, and high productivity (producing 2 nestlings),
   as well as population-level estimates of abundance and growth.
   4. The breeding population of bald eagles at VNP increased steadily from
   <10 pairs in the late 1970s to 48 pairs by 2016. At the nest-level,
   management significantly improved occupancy and success. At the
   population-level, management led to 8\% and 13\% increases in nest
   success and productivity rates, respectively, resulting in a 37\%
   increase in breeding pair abundance.
   5. Synthesis and applications. There is a clear need to evaluate how
   management approaches at multiple scales assist in species recovery. Our
   study uses an Integrated Population Model to reveal the population-level
   benefits of a widely used, individual-based management action
   (protecting nests using buffer zones) on a recovering raptor.},

Title = {Ecological vulnerability indicators},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {329-334},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Indicators provide easy and quick information on the status or condition
   of an object of interest and are therefore widely used in policy-making.
   In recent years, policy interest in vulnerability research has increased
   and a growing number of studies have been aimed at developing
   vulnerability indicators. Some of these studies have been done within
   the social-ecological system (SES) framework, taking into account both
   social vulnerability and ecological vulnerability. A particular
   challenged faced, however, is with regard to the incorporation of
   indicators to capture the latter, especially as the concept of
   vulnerability as applied in ecology is relatively new and not yet
   well-explored. This paper expounds on this problem by answering the
   following questions: (1) How are the concept of vulnerability and
   thereby ecological vulnerability currently understood? (2) What are the
   challenges in the development and use of ecological vulnerability
   indicators? (3) What are the current efforts to overcome these
   challenges? One insight gathered is that due to the complexity,
   nonlinearity, and multiplicity of dynamics of natural systems,
   development of sufficiently general indicators of ecological
   vulnerability may not be realizable. Rather, ecological vulnerability
   assessment and the development of indicators thereof, whether done
   independent of the human system or within the SES, should be conducted
   at smaller scales and must be context-specific. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Collaborative management is a widely accepted means of resolving
   conflict amongst natural resource stakeholders. Power sharing is central
   to most conceptualizations of collaboration, but theoretical insights
   about power are only rarely used to interrogate collaborative processes.
   Agenda-setting theory was used to analyse cases of collaborative deer
   management in England, Scotland and Indiana (USA). Collaborative
   management agendas across scales and social contexts were found to be
   primarily set by contextual factors, particularly stakeholders drawing
   on specific cultures and policies, and pre-defining issues. These
   findings highlight significant gaps between the theory and practice of
   collaboration. If, in practice, substantial power has been wielded in
   advance, the capacity of subsequent collaborative processes to share
   power amongst stakeholders may be severely limited. To provide
   opportunities for differing cultural perspectives to be expressed and
   challenged, convenors of collaborative processes therefore need to be
   aware of and reflexive upon existing power relationships and structures.},

Title = {Use of physiological knowledge to control the invasive sea lamprey
   (Petromyzon marinus) in the Laurentian Great Lakes},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) control in the Laurentian Great Lakes
   of North America is an example of using physiological knowledge to
   successfully control an invasive species and rehabilitate an ecosystem
   and valuable fishery. The parasitic sea lamprey contributed to the
   devastating collapse of native fish communities after invading the Great
   Lakes during the 1800s and early 1900s. Economic tragedy ensued with the
   loss of the fishery and severe impacts to property values and tourism
   resulting from sea lamprey-induced ecological changes. To control the
   sea lamprey and rehabilitate the once vibrant Great Lakes ecosystem and
   economy, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission (Commission) was formed by
   treaty between Canada and the United States in 1955. The Commission has
   developed a sea lamprey control programme based on their physiological
   vulnerabilities, which includes (i) the application of selective
   pesticides (lampricides), which successfully kill sedentary sea lamprey
   larvae in their natal streams; (ii) barriers to spawning migrations and
   associated traps to prevent infestations of upstream habitats and remove
   adult sea lamprey before they reproduce; and (iii) the release of
   sterilized males to reduce the reproductive potential of spawning
   populations in select streams. Since 1958, the application of the sea
   lamprey control programme has suppressed sea lamprey populations by
   similar to 90\% from peak abundance. Great Lakes fish populations have
   rebounded and the economy is now thriving. In hopes of further enhancing
   the efficacy and selectivity of the sea lamprey control programme, the
   Commission is exploring the use of (i) sea lamprey chemosensory cues
   (pheromones and alarm cues) to manipulate behaviours and physiologies,
   and (ii) genetics to identify and manipulate genes associated with key
   physiological functions, for control purposes. Overall, the Commission
   capitalizes on the unique physiology of the sea lamprey and strives to
   develop a diverse integrated programme to successfully control a once
   devastating invasive species.},

Abstract = {There are multiple demands for the development of effective and
   sustainable disease management practices in wildlife, but solutions are
   widely lacking. In this perspective, we focus on the need to structure
   research to support advancement toward enhanced wildlife disease control
   solutions. We concentrate on the need for improved integration between
   wildlife disease management undertaken in situ with modelling to guide
   and assess disease management actions. We recognise that many disease
   management attempts in wildlife are made in isolation, are not supported
   by modelling and are not used as a stepping stone to advancement.
   However, we emphasise that the development of disease control practices
   in wildlife is greater than any one management attempt, and should be
   seen and undertaken as a set of systematic steps towards
   well-articulated management goals. We describe modelling of disease
   management and in situ disease management as two complementary phases of
   investigation, viewed as a feedback loop to support advancements, and
   highlight established and less established pathways in this loop. We
   describe how stakeholders engaged in practical management actions can
   better engage with modellers, and also the need for more fit-for-purpose
   modelling that captures the on-ground realities of in situ practice to
   support advancements. The concepts and approaches described in this
   perspective are captured within a Model Integrated Disease Management
   for wildlife framework. We illustrate the framework, concepts and
   challenges proposed in this perspective using a case study for which we
   have experience: sarcoptic mange (etiologic agent Sarcoptes scabiei) in
   bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus). Synthesis and applications:
   Effective and sustainable solutions to critical wildlife diseases are
   needed. Progress can be improved when disease management is guided
   through iterative and fit-for-purpose integration between modelling and
   in situ practice. We describe and illustrate a Model Integrated Disease
   Management for wildlife framework. Moving beyond isolated disease
   management attempts into a structured process of advancement can help
   overcome barriers to tackling pathogens threatening wildlife.},

Title = {Climate warming causes life-history evolution in a model for Atlantic
   cod (Gadus morhua)},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Climate change influences the marine environment, with ocean warming
   being the foremost driving factor governing changes in the physiology
   and ecology of fish. At the individual level, increasing temperature
   influences bioenergetics and numerous physiological and life-history
   processes, which have consequences for the population level and beyond.
   We provide a state-dependent energy allocation model that predicts
   temperature-induced adaptations for life histories and behaviour for the
   North-East Arctic stock (NEA) of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in response
   to climate warming. The key constraint is temperature-dependent
   respiratory physiology, and the model includes a number of trade-offs
   that reflect key physiological and ecological processes. Dynamic
   programming is used to find an evolutionarily optimal strategy of
   foraging and energy allocation that maximizes expected lifetime
   reproductive output given constraints from physiology and ecology. The
   optimal strategy is then simulated in a population, where survival,
   foraging behaviour, growth, maturation and reproduction emerge. Using
   current forcing, the model reproduces patterns of growth, size-at-age,
   maturation, gonad production and natural mortality for NEA cod. The
   predicted climate responses are positive for this stock; under a 2
   degrees C warming, the model predicted increased growth rates and a
   larger asymptotic size. Maturation age was unaffected, but gonad weight
   was predicted to more than double. Predictions for a wider range of
   temperatures, from 2 to 7 degrees C, show that temperature responses
   were gradual; fish were predicted to grow faster and increase
   reproductive investment at higher temperatures. An emergent pattern of
   higher risk acceptance and increased foraging behaviour was also
   predicted. Our results provide important insight into the effects of
   climate warming on NEA cod by revealing the underlying mechanisms and
   drivers of change. We show how temperature-induced adaptations of
   behaviour and several life-history traits are not only mediated by
   physiology but also by trade-offs with survival, which has consequences
   for conservation physiology.},

   and Measures},
Journal = {HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {255-270},
Abstract = {Two parallel lines of inquiry, tolerance for and acceptance of wildlife
   populations, have arisen in the applied literature on wildlife
   conservation to assess probability of successfully establishing or
   increasing populations of controversial species. Neither of these lines
   is well grounded in social science theory, and diverse measures have
   been employed to assess tolerance, which inhibits comparability across
   studies. We empirically tested behavioral measures of tolerance against
   self-reports of previous policy-relevant behavior and behavioral
   intentions. Both composite behavioral measures were strongly correlated
   (r > .70) with two attitudinal measures of tolerance commonly employed
   in the literature. The strong correlation between attitudinal and
   behavioral measures suggests existing attitudinal measures represent
   valid, parsimonious measures of tolerance that may be useful when
   behavioral measures are too cumbersome or misreporting of behavior is
   anticipated. Our results demonstrate how behavioral measures of
   tolerance provide additional, useful information beyond general
   attitudinal measures.},

Title = {Hummingbirds in high alpine habitats of the tropical Mexican mountains:
   new elevational records and ecological considerations},
Journal = {AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Most hummingbird species are distributed in tropical lowlands and
   mountains with few species reaching the alpine environments of high
   mountain peaks. Field surveys were conducted in nine alpine sites across
   four of the highest volcanoes in central Mexico for three years to
   document hummingbird occurrence, habitat use, and some aspects of
   behavior. We also searched through historical museum collections and
   online databases to document early records of hummingbirds in Mexican
   alpine habitats. In addition, we conducted a search through historical
   herbarium collections of ornithophilous plant species in alpine
   habitats, and a literature search on glacier retreats in Mexico to
   establish past and present elevational limits of alpine vegetation. We
   recorded the presence of four hummingbird species using floral resources
   across the nine study sites: Cynanthus latirostris (Broad-billed
   Hummingbird), Hylocharis leucotis (White-eared Hummingbird), Lampornis
   clemenciae (Blue-throated Hummingbird), and Selasphorus platycercus
   (Broad-tailed Hummingbird). The latter two species were recorded
   frequently throughout the growing season (May-October), whereas C.
   latirostris was observed on one day in July, and H. leucotis on two days
   in April and May. Three of the four species were observed foraging from
   Castilleja tolucensis, an alpine Mexican endemic herb, at 4428 m above
   sea level, and all four species foraged from Penstemon gentianoides at
   the lower alpine sites 390(M 100. At the highest elevations, we observed
   hummingbirds hovering and perching on rocks while feeding from flowers
   at ground level. Both male and female of L. clemenciae and S.
   platycercus were present at patches of P. gentianoides; however, with S.
   platycercus, males accounted for more than 80\% of the individuals
   observed and more than 95\% of individuals observed at the highest
   elevations. Additionally, a survey of historical records from museum
   collections and bird sightings from e-databases revealed only three
   early records of hummingbirds in alpine sites, with only one observed
   earlier than 1987. This suggests that hummingbirds were not recorded
   earlier in alpine habitats because of a lack of sampling. Nevertheless,
   evidence from glacial retreats and plant distributions along an
   elevational gradient also indicate that hummingbirds have expanded their
   elevational range as new habitats have opened up for colonization
   associated with global climate change. The results reported here are the
   first records of the our hummingbird species in the Mexican alpine
   grassland and one of the highest altitudinal records for hummingbirds in
   North America. We discuss the importance and conservation implications
   of alpine ecosystems in Mexico as habitats for hummingbirds.},

Abstract = {Zoonotic pathogens can harm human health and well-being directly or by
   impacting livestock. Pathogens that spillover from wildlife can also
   impair conservation efforts if humans perceive wildlife as pests.
   Brucellosis, caused by the bacterium Brucella abortus, circulates in elk
   and bison herds of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and poses a risk to
   cattle and humans. Our goal was to understand the relative effects of
   climatic drivers, host demography and management control programmes on
   disease dynamics. Using >20 years of serologic, demographic and
   environmental data on brucellosis in elk, we built stochastic
   compartmental models to assess the influences of climate forcing, herd
   immunity, population turnover and management interventions on pathogen
   transmission. Data were collected at feedgrounds visited in winter by
   free-ranging elk in Wyoming, USA. Snowpack, hypothesized as a driver of
   elk aggregation and thus brucellosis transmission, was strongly
   correlated across feedgrounds. We expected this variable to drive
   synchronized disease dynamics across herds. Instead, we demonstrate
   asynchronous epizootics driven by variation in demographic rates. We
   evaluated the effectiveness of test-and-slaughter of seropositive female
   elk at two feedgrounds. Test-and-slaughter temporarily reduced
   herd-level seroprevalence but likely reduced herd immunity while
   removing few infectious individuals, resulting in subsequent outbreaks
   once the intervention ceased. We simulated an alternative strategy of
   removing seronegative female elk and found it would increase herd
   immunity, yielding fewer infections. We evaluated a second experimental
   treatment wherein feeding density was reduced at one feedground, but we
   found no evidence for an effect despite a decade of implementation.
   Synthesis and applications. Positive serostatus is often weakly
   correlated with infectiousness but is nevertheless used to make
   management decisions including lethal removal in wildlife disease
   systems. We show how this can have adverse consequences whereas efforts
   that maintain herd immunity can have longer-term protective effects.
   Climatic drivers may not result in synchronous disease dynamics across
   populations unless vital rates are also similar because demographic
   factors have a large influence on disease patterns.},

Title = {Short-term regeneration dynamics of Wyoming big sagebrush at two sites

Abstract = {Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) is a
   widespread shrub across the western United States, and there is great
   interest among scientists and land managers in its ecology and
   conservation, particularly with regard to maintaining structural
   heterogeneity of sagebrush stands for wildlife habitat and livestock
   forage. Yet little is known about its short-term regeneration dynamics
   and the implications of those dynamics for changes in stand structure.
   We examined changes among sagebrush size classes across 3 years, as well
   as emergence of sagebrush from seed bank and seed rain samples at 2
   sagebrush shrubland sites in northern Utah: a lower-density site (1.4
   plants/m(2), SE 0.11) with no recent history of manipulation and a
   higher-density site (1.9 plants/m(2), SE 0.21) that had recently been
   treated with herbicide to reduce sagebrush cover. On both sites, numbers
   of sagebrush plants in the largest size class decreased over the 3-year
   time period, while dead and medium-sized sagebrush plants increased. At
   the higher-density herbicide-treated site, this size class shift
   appeared to be driven by growth of small plants into the medium size
   class, likely associated with reductions in numbers of (and competition
   from) large plants. At the lower-density site, it appears that densities
   of large plants declined because the plants shrank in size, possibly due
   to herbivory. Sagebrush seed rain did not differ between fall and spring
   assessments. Forbs had the greatest representation in the seed bank,
   followed by grasses and then sagebrush, though the number of sagebrush
   seeds may be sufficient for seedling recruitment. These results
   illustrate that shifts among sagebrush size classes, especially
   transitions of small shrubs into the medium size class, may be a primary
   and immediate pathway of stand recovery, in addition to recruitment from
   seed. These findings underscore the importance of sagebrush stand
   structure to plant community health and may aid in anticipating
   responses to disturbances such as drought or herbivory.},

Title = {Using dietary metabarcoding analyses to characterise

Abstract = {Globally, the use of agricultural fields by waterbirds has increased,
   resulting in conflicts with farmers. Designing effective management
   strategies to resolve these conflicts requires understanding the
   species' resource use. Dietary analyses can shed light on the extent of
   consumption of agricultural crops and surrounding natural resources, as
   well as the potential relationship between diet and an individual's body
   condition and ultimately its fitness. We examined the dietary
   composition of the tropical magpie goose Anseranas semipalmata,
   seasonally utilising a mixed natural-agricultural landscape of northern
   Australia. We used DNA metabarcoding of intestinal contents from hunted
   geese to reconstruct individual diets and evaluated body condition from
   morphometric measurements. We compared the relative contribution of
   agricultural and natural foods to dietary composition, and investigated
   how this contribution varied spatially, temporally and among individuals
   that differed in body condition. We found that geese consumed both
   agricultural and naturally occurring plants assigned to at least 35
   taxa. The most frequent and abundant taxa belonged to three families:
   Poaceae (grasses), Cyperaceae (sedges) and Anacardiaceae (mangoes).
   Dietary composition varied substantially among sampling sites and over
   time but not with body condition of geese. Synthesis and applications.
   We used a novel approach to investigate the diet of a waterbird
   perceived as problematic across an agricultural landscape in tropical
   Australia. We showed that individuals forage opportunistically, and that
   agricultural crops, while eaten, may not represent an essential part of
   geese diet across the study region. The knowledge acquired provides new
   insights into the species' foraging ecology offering clear alternatives
   for mitigating goose-agriculture interactions. Providing
   disturbance-free alternative foraging areas or minimising the
   attractiveness of targeted agricultural fields (e.g. shorter grass,
   alternative ground cover) may alleviate crop consumption while
   benefiting the species' long-term conservation. While also highlighting
   the limitations of DNA metabarcoding, our dietary study emphasises the
   potential of this methodology to improve our understanding of crop
   damage by wildlife, allowing effective evaluation of management
   requirements.},

Title = {Integrating socioecological suitability with human-wildlife conflict
   risk: Case study for translocation of a large ungulate},

Abstract = {Translocations are essential for re-establishing wildlife populations.
   As they sometimes fail, it is critical to assess factors that influence
   their success pre-translocation. Socioecological suitability models
   (SESMs) integrate social acceptance and ecological suitability to enable
   identification of areas where wildlife populations will expand, which
   makes it likely that SESMs will also be useful for predicting
   translocation success. To inform site selection for potential elk Cervus
   canadensis reintroduction to north-eastern Minnesota, United States, we
   developed broadscale maps of social acceptance from surveys of local
   residents and landowners, animal use equivalence (AUE) from forage
   measured in the field and empirical conflict risk from geospatial data.
   Resulting SESMs integrated social acceptance favourability scores, AUE
   and conflict risk, and weighted SESMs showed the relative influences of
   acceptance and conflict. Social acceptance was positive for local
   residents and landowners (mean >= 5.4; scale of 1-7). AUE (scaled to an
   elk home range) ranged between 1 and 9 elk/16 km(2) during winter, and
   from 14 to 83 elk/16 km(2) during summer. Human-elk conflict risk was
   low (mean <= 0.10; scaled 0-1), increasing from north to south.
   Geographical distributions differed for social acceptance, AUE and
   conflict risk, and weighted SESMs revealed unsuitable areas that were
   otherwise obscured. Synthesis and applications. Integrating
   human-wildlife conflict risk into SESMs shows where social acceptance of
   translocated species is likely to erode, even where viewed favourably
   pre-translocation, to inform translocation planning by highlighting
   interactions between key factors. Such integrated models supplement
   existing reintroduction biology frameworks by supporting decision-making
   and knowledge development. In north-eastern Minnesota, natural resource
   managers who are considering elk reintroductions are using SESMs
   reported here to identify where human-elk conflict is unlikely to result
   in an isolated elk population and where addressing concerns for area
   residents about conflict risk is essential.},

Title = {Climate and anthropogenic factors determine site occupancy in Scotland's
   Northern-range badger population: implications of context-dependent
   responses under environmental change},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {AimIn the light of human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC),
   populations are exposed to ever-greater bioclimatic stress at the edge
   of a species' historic range. The distribution dynamics of European
   badgers (Meles meles) at their southern edge are linked tightly to
   climatic variability. We contribute critical data on how climatic
   context and local factors determine site occupancy in a northern-range
   population.
   LocationEleven study areas (averaging similar to 21.3km(2)) spread over
   similar to 50,000km(2) in Northern Scotland.
   MethodsWhile accounting for heterogeneous detectability, we applied
   single-season occupancy models to broad-scale camera-trapping data (168
   stations) to evaluate how Autumn-Winter weather conditions interact with
   land-cover type (including agricultural land) and human disturbance to
   determine badger occupancy.
   ResultsMean minimum daily winter temperature and elevation influenced
   inter-site occupancy. When clustering study areas into two distinct
   topo-climatic types, badger occupancy was associated with agriculture in
   areas with lower mean minimum winter temperatures (<0.3 degrees C) at
   higher elevation (>246m). In areas with higher mean minimum winter
   temperature (>1.2 degrees C) at lower elevation (<133m), badgers
   selected sites further away from human infrastructures (settlements and
   main roads). Climatic factors and human disturbance interact in
   intricate, context-dependent patterns to determine badger site
   occupancy.
   Main ConclusionsThe UKCP09 Medium Emissions Scenario projects a winter
   mean minimum temperature increase of between 1 and 3 degrees C (central
   estimate) for Northern Scotland by the 2050s. Although warmer weather
   should benefit badger occupancy, this may be counteracted by up to a
   predicted 5\% human population increase in the Scottish highlands, by
   2037, which is likely to disturb badgers. We show that even in instances
   where species' regional responses to climate change are positive, these
   effects can be neutralized by other anthropogenic pressures. Our
   findings add to the growing body of evidence advocating that interactive
   effects should be taken into account when planning conservation
   management.},

Abstract = {Across Europe, hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) appear to be in decline
   in both urban and rural landscapes. Current methods used to monitor
   urban populations are, however, associated with several potential
   limitations. In this study, we conducted hedgehog footprint-tunnel
   surveys in 219 residential gardens across Reading, UK between
   May-September in 2013 and/or 2014; gardens were surveyed for five
   continuous days. Single-species occupancy models were used to
   investigate factors influencing hedgehog occupancy and two-species
   occupancy models were used to estimate a species interaction factor
   (SIF) between hedgehogs and (a) badgers (Meles meles), (b) foxes (Vulpes
   vulpes) and (c) dogs (Canis familiaris). The five-day survey protocol
   was associated with a false-absence error rate of 0.1-0.4\%, indicating
   that it was a reliable method for determining hedgehog presence;
   conversely, 34.7\% of householders were not able to correctly predict
   hedgehog presence or absence. Hedgehogs were widely distributed across
   Reading, but detected in only 32-40\% of gardens. None of the
   within-garden or outside-garden factors investigated significantly
   affected hedgehog occupancy in the single-species models, but the
   two-species models indicated that badgers (SIF=0.471 +/- 0.188), but not
   foxes (SIF=0.954 +/- 0.048) or dogs (SIF=0.780 +/- 0.228), negatively
   affected the presence of hedgehogs in gardens, although not
   significantly. Overall, footprint-tunnels represent a viable field
   method for monitoring urban hedgehog populations, however, other
   approaches are required to identify factors that make gardens hedgehog
   friendly.},

Title = {Capture stress and post-release mortality of blacktip sharks in
   recreational charter fisheries of the Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {Understanding the stress responses of sharks to recreational catch and
   release fishing has important management and conservation implications.
   The blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus is a popular recreational
   species targeted throughout the western, central and eastern Gulf of
   Mexico (Gulf) yet it is unclear what levels of physiological stress
   result from catch-release fishing practices with hook and line gear and
   if the stress levels result in post-release mortality. This study
   correlates physiological response to stress through blood chemistry
   analysis and examines post-release behaviour of adult blacktip sharks
   caught to determine post-release mortality rates. Release behaviour was
   determined by pop-up satellite archival transmitting (PSAT) tags that
   record temperature, depth and light level data. To quantify
   physiological stress levels, blood samples were collected from 52
   blacktip sharks and a suite of metabolic and osmotic markers were
   measured. Thirty-six of those blacktip sharks were also outfitted with a
   PSAT tag yielding time-at-large from 3 to 180 days. Of the 36 tags, 22
   (61\%) provided sufficient data to confirm post-release fate and 11
   (31\%) were recovered providing high-resolution data. Tag data suggests
   a post-release morality rate of 22.7\% (95\% confidence interval
   7.8-45.4\%), with mortality occurring within minutes (immediate
   mortality) to over 12 h post-release (delayed mortality). Compared to
   survivors, immediate mortalities exhibited significantly higher lactate
   (median 2.8 mmol/L-survivor vs 5.9 mmol/(Limmediate mortality)) and
   significantly lower hematocrit (median 24.4\% (survivor) vs 14\%
   (immediate mortality)) levels, but no difference was detected between
   survivors and delayed mortalities. Higher mortality in the western
   (30\%) compared to the central (20\%) Gulf may be due to shark handling.
   All PSATs from mortalities (N = 5) were recovered, and archived data
   revealed evidence of tag ingestion by predators. Results suggest reduced
   fight time, decreased handling time and limited air exposure provide
   blacktip sharks the best survival chances after release by recreational
   anglers.},

Abstract = {Prunus serotina, with high wildlife value, is a tree with edible fruits
   that is native to North America. In this study, the complete chloroplast
   (cp) genome of Prunus serotina (Amygdaleae) was determined through
   Illumina sequencing method. The complete chloroplast genome of P.
   serotina was 158,788 bp in length and contained a pair of IR regions
   (26,294 bp) separated by a small single copy region (18,911 bp) and a
   large single copy region (82,048 bp). The cp genome of P. serotina
   encoded 130 genes including 84 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes and
   eight ribosomal RNA genes. The overall GC content of P. serotina cp
   genome is 36.6\%. By phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian method, P.
   serotina showed the closest relationship with Sohing (Prunus
   nepalensis). This complete chloroplast genomes can be subsequently used
   for population genomic studies of P. serotina and provide valuable
   insight into its in situ and ex situ conservation.},

Abstract = {Wildlife ranching is the fastest growing industry in South Africa, with
   most ranches having been converted from large-scale livestock farms.
   This article investigated perceptions and attitudes of rural communities
   located in wildlife-rich rural areas toward integrated
   wildlife/livestock land uses, and analyzed socio-demographic factors
   influencing household interest in these land uses. Data were collected
   from 130 households selected through stratified random sampling
   techniques from nine villages adjacent to the Kruger National Park.
   Results showed a general interest in pursuing wildlife land uses, but
   differences in attitudes toward wildlife between households with cattle
   and without. Multinomial regression results indicated that age,
   education level, monthly income, and cattle ownership significantly
   impacted the odds of a household being interested in participation or
   not. Addressing concerns about human-wildlife conflict and clarifying
   potential benefits to households and the community is necessary for
   increased interest in integrated land uses.},

Abstract = {Use of environmental DNA for wildlife species detection is a field of
   research that has seen rapid growth in recent years, however, the
   majority of research to date has been focused on aquatic species. Here,
   we propose and test a novel source for the detection of terrestrial
   species with environmental DNA: drinking water from watering holes and
   wildlife water developments. We hypothesized that when terrestrial
   animals drink from a water source, DNA from saliva and buccal cells is
   shed and can be isolated for species identification. We tested this
   hypothesis in a pilot study by filtering drinking water supplied to
   coyotes (Canis latrans) at a captive coyote research facility. DNA was
   successfully extracted from filters, amplified by the polymerase chain
   reaction, and sequenced, and sequences were positively identified as
   belonging to coyotes. We believe this environmental DNA based approach
   holds great promise for the detection of terrestrial species of
   conservation concern.},

Title = {Modelling the distribution and intraguild associations of an

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Aim Understanding the range-wide distribution and abundance of species
   is critical for their conservation and management. Grey foxes (Urocyon
   cinereoargenteus) are an understudied, low-density mesocarnivore with a
   broad geographic range. However, the factors that underlie this broad
   distribution are poorly understood and large-scale analyses of this
   species' range and ecological niche are lacking. Location We modelled
   the probability and intensity of site use for grey foxes at two spatial
   scales using a coordinated survey of 1485 camera traps across the
   contiguous United States in 2019. Methods We used Bayesian occupancy
   modelling and post hoc species interaction comparisons to evaluate
   factors hypothesized to affect grey fox site use, including habitat,
   anthropogenic effects, and intraguild interactions. Results Our results
   showed that the presence of bobcats (Lynx rufus) and striped skunks
   (Mephitis mephitis), as well as forest variables, had positive
   associations with grey fox site use. Surprisingly, we found no support
   for negative effects on grey fox space use from dominant competitors
   (coyotes, Canis latrans, or pumas, Puma concolor), and a complete lack
   of effects from urbanization metrics and gross primary productivity. We
   did, however, find a consistent negative association with red foxes
   (Vulpes vulpes), which is the most ecologically and morphologically
   similar competitor of grey foxes. Main conclusions Taken together, these
   results imply that grey fox distribution is not limited by dominant
   carnivores or anthropogenic pressure. Rather, this species seems to
   occupy a unique niche across its broad range by exploiting diverse
   forest habitats shared with less ecologically similar competitors
   (striped skunks and raccoons, Procyon lotor), while being somewhat
   limited by a competitor occupying a similar ecological niche (red
   foxes). Our study highlights the value of broad-scale approaches for
   evaluating factors influencing the distribution and abundance of
   understudied species, as local dynamics might fail to manifest across
   geographic ranges.},

Title = {Using molecular and observational techniques to estimate the number and
   raiding patterns of crop-raiding elephants},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {788-796},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {P>1. Conflict between humans and animals, generated by behaviours like
   crop raiding, can represent a major threat to the survival and
   conservation of protected species. Crop raiding is an example where the
   conflict is assumed to be attributable to a small number of habitually
   raiding animals. No studies have systematically tested this assumption
   on African elephants Loxodonta africana.
   2. In the greater Amboseli basin, in southern Kenya, we determined the
   number of elephants that come into conflict with humans through crop
   raiding, their gender, and their patterns of raiding. We tracked
   footprints, and observed elephants after they raided farms, and
   genotyped DNA extracted from faeces collected from raided farms. Using
   these data, we estimated the number of raiders with asymptotic
   regression and count models.
   3. We found that 241 elephants from several elephant populations in the
   Amboseli basin raided farms. Raiders were independent males; we detected
   no females raiding crops. Approximately 35\% of the raiders were from
   the Amboseli elephant population, representing about 1/3 of the
   independent males in that population. Approximately 12\% of raiders from
   the Amboseli elephant population were habitual and were responsible for
   56\% of elephant raiding events.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that targeted
   elimination of habitual raiders could in theory reduce crop raiding.
   However, the large pool of occasional raiders, the availability of
   palatable crops in areas of conflict, and the link between crop-raiding
   and natural male foraging tactics, indicates great potential for
   recruitment of habitual raiders from this pool of occasional raiders.
   Furthermore, shooting of raiders as a strategy for reducing crop raiding
   carries a high risk of misidentifying habitual raiders. We suggest
   instead an ethical management strategy that uses remote monitoring of
   raiders as an early warning system for crop protection, and longitudinal
   studies to evaluate the development of habitual raiding.},

   sequence of Zostera marina, of which the length is 143,877 bp. It
   contained a pair of IR regions (25,915 bp) separated by a small single
   copy region (8823 bp) and a large single copy region (83,224 bp). The
   overall GC contents of the chloroplast genome were 35.5\%. This circular
   genome contains 116 annotated genes, including 78 protein-coding genes,
   30 tRNAs and 8 rRNA. By phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood
   (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ) method, Z. marina showed the closest
   relationship with Elodea canadensis and Potamogeton perfoliatus. This
   complete chloroplast genomes can be subsequently used for population
   genomic studies of Z. marina and provide valuable insight into in situ
   and ex situ conservation for this valuable species.},

Title = {A spatially explicit analysis of Paysandisia archon attack on the
   endemic Mediterranean dwarf palm},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1719-1734},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Autochthonous plant species are heavily threatened by the increasing
   spread of invasive insects. The spatial distribution of invasive
   species' hosts is likely to play a pivotal role in the establishment and
   further expansion of the invading species; more specifically, distance
   and density dependent (DDD) processes linked to plant spatial
   arrangement are crucial in determining susceptibility to attack, but
   they have usually been overlooked in invasive research. We take a
   spatially explicit approach to evaluate potential DDD processes in the
   interaction between Paysandisia archon, a tropical lepidopteran recently
   introduced in Spain, and the endemic Mediterranean dwarf palm
   (Chamaerops humilis) in Mallorca (Balearic Islands). Specifically, we
   used spatial marked point pattern analyses, which allowed testing
   whether DDD processes affect attack probability and intensity on three
   dwarf palm populations corresponding to three different invasion phases
   (i.e., infestation core, early expansion, and expansion front). Our
   approach also allowed evaluation of whether and how intrinsic palm
   traits (size, sex) alter the proneness to P. archon attack over a range
   of spatial scales. The occurrence and nature of DDD effects on C.
   humilis performance varied largely among localities. At the infestation
   core, our analyses revealed positive density dependence, i.e., reduced
   damage at high densities or proximity to conspecific neighbors. By
   contrast, the early expansion locality showed negative density
   dependence of C. humilis performance, whereas at the expansion front,
   there was no evidence of DDD effects. Larger palms were consistently
   more prone to P. archon attack than small ones up to scales of 50 m. We
   found no evidence that palm sex altered the probability of attack by P.
   archon. Our results highlight the importance of spatially explicit
   analyses for assessing invasive events and point to the need of early
   interventions and prioritizing management efforts on larger palms in
   order to guarantee the conservation of autochthonous dwarf palm
   populations.},

Title = {Association between arthropod densities suggests dominance of top-down
   control of predator-prey food-webs on pear trees during winter},
Journal = {FOOD WEBS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although winter in the temperate zone is considered to be the period of
   arthropod quiescence, some pests and their natural enemies remain active
   and interact in simplified food-webs. Limited information exists about
   the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes regulating
   arthropod food-webs and their spatio-temporal dynamics during winter.
   This information is essential for the development of effective
   conservation biocontrol methods. We investigated how the pest management
   of pear orchards (integrated {[}IPM] vs organic) and tree location
   within orchards (margin vs centre) influence the association between
   densities of winter-active spiders, insect herbivores and
   winter-inactive predators (spiders, insects) from October to April. We
   installed carboard bands on trunks and branches of pear trees in four
   organic and four IPM orchards to collect bark -dwelling arthropods. We
   then modelled relationships between the densities of four functional
   arthropod groups, namely winter-active spiders, winter-inactive spiders,
   winter-inactive insect predators, and herbivores. In early winter, we
   found a hump-shaped relationship between the densities of winter-active
   spiders and her-bivores. This agrees with the top-down model of the
   ecosystem exploitation hypothesis, predicting that predators are first
   bottom-up limited, then accumulate with prey densities, and exert
   top-down control when they become sufficiently abundant. The densities
   of herbivores strongly declined during winter, a phenomenon which may be
   partly, along with other causes of natural mortality, attributable to
   predation by winter active spiders. The as-sociation between
   winter-active spiders and winter-inactive arthropod predators switched
   from positive to none in organic orchards or even to a negative
   association in IPM orchards. Negative intraguild interactions seem to be
   intensified due to the declining availability of alternative prey.
   Overall, the investigated food-webs seem to be mostly top-down regulated
   during winter, and IPM seems to intensify intraguild interactions.},

Title = {Niche Complementarity and Resistance to Grazing Promote the Invasion
   Success of Sargassum horneri in North America},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Invasive species are a growing threat to conservation in marine
   ecosystems, yet we lack a predictive understanding of ecological factors
   that influence the invasiveness of exotic marine species. We used
   surveys and manipulative experiments to investigate how an exotic
   seaweed, Sargassum horneri, interacts with native macroalgae and
   herbivores off the coast of California. We asked whether the invasion
   (i.e., the process by which an exotic species exhibits rapid population
   growth and spread in the novel environment) of S. horneri is influenced
   by three mechanisms known to affect the invasion of exotic plants on
   land: competition, niche complementarity and herbivory. We found that
   the removal of S. horneri over 3.5 years from experimental plots had
   little effect on the biomass or taxonomic richness of the native algal
   community. Differences between removal treatments were apparent only in
   spring at the end of the experiment when S. horneri biomass was
   substantially higher than in previous sampling periods. Surveys across a
   depth range of 0-30 m revealed inverse patterns in the biomass of S.
   horneri and native subcanopy-forming macroalgae, with S. horneri peaking
   at intermediate depths (5-20 m) while the aggregated biomass of native
   species was greatest at shallow (<5 m) and deeper (>20 m) depths. The
   biomass of S. horneri and native algae also displayed different seasonal
   trends, and removal of S. horneri from experimental plots indicated the
   seasonality of native algae was largely unaffected by fluctuations in S.
   horneri. Results from grazing assays and surveys showed that native
   herbivores favor native kelp over Sargassum as a food source, suggesting
   that reduced palatability may help promote the invasion of S. horneri.
   The complementary life histories of S. horneri and native algae suggest
   that competition between them is generally weak, and that niche
   complementarity and resistance to grazing are more important in
   promoting the invasion success of S. horneri.},

Volume = {26},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Ranchers living near large carnivores can adopt diverse practices to
   prevent livestock damage. Effective management interventions to help
   reduce damage must address the varied needs of ranchers by segmenting
   audiences for more targeted programs. We developed a typology that
   conceptualized six types of ranchers based on the theory of planned
   behavior. We posited that rancher types were driven by: attitudes;
   social norms; perceived control; emotional disposition; risk perception;
   and contextual factors. To test the typology throughout Costa Rica, we
   conducted a structured survey of a random sample of 93 ranchers affected
   by jaguar and puma predation and paired them with a sample of 69
   unaffected neighbors. Cluster analyses of survey results provided
   empirical support for a typology of four types of ranchers, two of which
   were predicted by the theory of planned behavior: preventive ranchers
   who take control to prevent felid damage; and helpless ranchers who lack
   control. We also identified a risk-neutral type who takes no action as
   they do not perceive the cats as a threat; and a cat-troubled type
   influenced mainly by negative emotions toward big cats. This last type
   supports the need to include emotional factors in theoretical frameworks
   when dealing with human-wildlife conflict. The typology is useful for
   designing improved policy and management interventions to reduce
   wildlife conflicts.},

Title = {Spatial density pattern of Himalayan Ibex (Capra sibirica) in Pakistan},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {39},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mountain ungulates perform a key role in maintaining the balance of
   ecosystems as they are the primary consumers of vegetation and prey for
   large predators. The mountain ranges of northern Pakistan are home to
   six species of mountain ungulates, and the Himalayan ibex (Capra
   sibirica), hereafter ibex, is the most abundant among them. This study
   was conducted in three adminis-trative regions of northern Pakistan,
   viz. Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Khyber
   Pakhtunkhwa (KP), to generate a range-wide density pattern map of ibex.
   A double -observer survey was conducted in 25 study sites during
   2018-2021 across the ibex distribution range, covering an area of about
   35,307 km2, by walking transects totaling 1647 km. Within the ibex range
   where the survey was not conducted due to financial and logistical
   constraints, we obtained species population information from local
   wildlife departments' most recent annual survey data. The aim was to
   generate a density map for the entire ibex range. Using the BBRe-capture
   package in program R, we estimated an ibex population of 7639 (95 \% CI)
   with a mean density of 0.21/km2 in the surveyed area. Combining with the
   secondary data from un-surveyed areas, the total population estimate for
   the country came to 10,242 ibex. The largest population densities were
   observed in four valleys (Shimshal, Gulkin-Hussaini, Khyber, and
   Khunjerab) of the Karakoram-Pamir range, followed by the Hindu Kush
   range (Chitral Wildlife Division {[}WD]). The central and eastern parts
   of the Karakoram range had moderate to low densities, while the
   Himalayan range (e.g., Astore Valley) supported a small population. The
   mean herd size was 15 individuals (range: 5-41), and the average
   detection probability of observers A and B was 0.69 and 0.48,
   respectively. The average male and young ratios per 100 females were
   estimated to be 75 and 81, respectively. The range-wide density map
   developed during the study provided an evidence for the impact of trophy
   hunting programs and an objective tool for range-wide con-servation
   planning of the species.},

Title = {Recruitment in a social carnivore before and after harvest},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Knowledge about recruitment in a population can be critical when making
   conservation decisions, particularly for harvested species. Harvest can
   affect population demography in complex ways and this may be
   particularly true for cooperatively breeding species whose successful
   reproduction is often linked with complex social dynamics. We currently
   have a poor understanding of how harvest affects recruitment in
   cooperatively breeding species. We used non-invasive genetic sampling
   and a natural experiment to estimate recruitment in a population of gray
   wolves Canis lupus before and after harvest in the northern Rocky
   Mountains, US (2008-2013). We hypothesized that recruitment would
   decline after hunting and trapping began and that the decline in
   recruitment would be attributable to the harvest of pups and not to the
   subtler mechanisms associated with group dynamics and reduced
   reproductive success. We collected fecal samples from wolves in 10 packs
   for 6 consecutive years, extracted DNA and genotyped 154 individual pups
   across 18 microsatellite loci. Population harvest rates averaged 23.8\%
   (sd=9.2). Our hypothesis that recruitment would decline was supported;
   survival from 3 to 15 months of age decreased from 0.60 {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 0.48-0.72] without harvest to 0.38 (95\% CI:
   0.28-0.48) with harvest and recruitment declined from 3.2 (95\% CI:
   2.1-4.3) to 1.6 (95\% CI: 1.1-2.1) pups per pack after harvest was
   initiated. We cannot unequivocally dismiss other factors that could have
   reduced recruitment, however, an increase in recruitment when harvest
   temporarily ceased lends support to our conclusion that harvest reduced
   recruitment. We attributed just 18-38\% of pup mortality directly to
   harvest and suggest that there are indirect effects of harvest on
   recruitment that may be associated with changes in group size and
   structure. Models that do not include both direct and indirect effects
   of harvest on recruitment may underestimate the potential impact of
   harvest on population growth in social species.},

Title = {Original Species diversity of woody vegetation along altitudinal
   gradient of the Western Himalayas},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The phytosociological attributes of woody species were investigated
   along an altitudinal gradient in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary. Detailed
   sampling was carried out in five altitudinal zones (from 1550 to 3550 m
   asl). A total of 81 woody species, including 33 trees (28 genera and 22
   families) and 48 shrub species (39 genera and 24 families) were
   reported. Density ranged from 150 +/- 19 trees/ha (Zone V, 3350-3550 m
   asl) to 530 +/- 36 trees ha(-1) (Zone I, 1550-1750 m asl) and 3.83 +/-
   0.31 shrubs 25 m(-2) (Zone-I 1550-1750 m) to 12.3 +/- 0.45 shrubs 25
   m(-2) (Zone-III 2900-3100 m). Total Basal Cover (TBC) fluctuated between
   2.91 +/- 0.74 m(2) ha(-1) (Zone-V) to 37.96 +/- 2.95 m(2) ha(-1)
   (Zone-I). The diversity index (H) of trees varied from 2.097 (Zone-V) to
   3.373 (Zone-I) and of shrubs ranged from 2.624 (Zone-V) to 4.209
   (Zone-I). The correlation (Carl Pearson) test indicated that species
   richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, b-diversity, and TBC declined
   sharply with increase in altitude. The average maturity index for trees
   varied from 16.36 to 33.57 and 11.59 to 32.67 for shrubs. The diversity
   of woody plants declined as altitude increased, indicating that
   environmental filtering acts as a key factor in shaping the woody
   vegetation at high altitudes. In lower altitudinal zones, most of the
   species exhibited a lognormal curve while species of higher altitudes
   followed geometric curves. The present study could prove beneficial for
   the foresters, policy-makers to understand the altitudinal behavior of
   species diversity and its degeneration patterns so that strategic
   conservation plan could be implemented in the coming future. Thus, the
   study is expected to provide information to understand the current
   status, ecology as well as conservational efforts required for this
   protected area. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Pet ownership affects engagement with animal-related activities and may
   be related to support of wildlife management. British participants (N =
   220) completed an online survey providing information on pet ownership,
   attitudes toward pets, and support for wildlife management strategies.
   Within this sample, pet owners and individuals with positive attitudes
   toward pets were less supportive of strategies that put human needs
   before the needs of wildlife, more supportive of strategies attempting
   to avoid species extinctions, and opposed to strategies requiring
   compromises of individual species. Pet owners' affectionate attitudes
   toward animals and opposition to their exploitation may be important in
   dictating attitudes toward wildlife. Conservation planners could apply
   these findings when seeking support for management strategies that
   constrain freedoms of pets and wildlife. Utilizing the sympathetic
   attitudes of pet owners toward animals by focusing on welfare and
   survival benefits for wildlife species may help foster support for
   management strategies.},

Abstract = {This article reports on the development and implementation of a

   to help with cross-cultural assessments of WVOs. Information provided by
   such assessments can assist conservation organizations in understanding
   and meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse population. The
   technique was administered to Latino and Chinese-American audiences in
   New York City. Focus group participants were shown a series of
   photographs depicting wildlife and human-wildlife interactions, and
   asked to individually evaluate each photograph and discuss their
   reactions. Results revealed this methodology to be effective in
   eliciting WVOs. Four WVO types recognized from previous literature were
   identified across the groups based on participant comments. This article
   concludes with suggestions on how to improve this methodology for future
   use and adapt it for applications in other settings.},

Title = {The role of social networks in partnership development with state
   wildlife agencies},
Journal = {HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE},
Abstract = {The emergence of partnerships between state wildlife agencies and public
   or private organizations has allowed for more efficient and effective
   strategies to address conservation concerns. Cultivating such
   partnerships can increase public engagement in decision-making processes
   and ensure better relationships with constituents. Grant programs are a
   proven method for many state wildlife agencies to create, improve, and
   maintain habitat with partners, and may also facilitate partnership
   development among constituents. This research evaluated the
   effectiveness of grant programs in building partnerships among
   grant-receiving organizations and others by using social network
   analysis to identify factors associated with establishing partnerships.
   Major factors in partnership selection were receiving a grant, receiving
   support prior to the grant, scale of partner organizations, and distance
   between organizations. Understanding elements that drive partnership
   development provides state wildlife agencies with the means to encourage
   more strategic partnerships and may facilitate state wildlife agencies

Title = {The lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol causes temporarymetabolic
   disturbances in juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens):
   implications for sea lamprey control and fish conservation},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {The pesticide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol ( TFM) is applied to
   rivers and streams draining into the Laurentian Great Lakes to control
   populations of invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), which are
   ongoing threats to fisheries during the lamprey's hematophagous,
   parasitic juvenile life stage. While TFM targets larval sea lamprey
   during treatments, threatened populations of juvenile lake sturgeon
   (Acipenser fulvescens), particularly young-of-the-year (<100 mm in
   length), may be adversely affected by TFM when their habitats overlap
   with larval sea lamprey. Exposure to TFM causes marked reductions in
   tissue glycogen and high energy phosphagens in lamprey and rainbow trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by interfering with oxidative ATP production in
   the mitochondria. To test that environmentally relevant concentrations
   of TFM would similarly affect juvenile lake sturgeon, we exposed them to
   the larval sea lamprey minimum lethal concentration (9-h LC99.9), which
   mimicked concentrations of a typical lampricide application and
   quantified energy stores and metabolites in the carcass, liver and
   brain. Exposure to TFM reduced brain ATP, PCr and glycogen by 50-60\%,
   while lactate increased by 45-50\% at 6 and 9 h. A rapid and sustained
   depletion of liver glucose and glycogen of more than 50\% was also
   observed, whereas the respective concentrations of ATP and glycogen were
   reduced by 60\% and 80\% after 9 h, along with higher lactate and a
   slight metabolic acidosis (similar to 0.1 pH unit). We conclude that
   exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TFMcauses
   metabolic disturbances in lake sturgeon that can lead to impaired
   physiological performance and, in some cases, mortality. Our
   observations support practices such as delaying TFMtreatments to late
   summer/fall or using alternative TFMapplication strategies to mitigate
   non-target effects in waters where lake sturgeon are present. These
   actions would help to conserve this historically and culturally
   significant species in the Great Lakes.},

Abstract = {Northern regions of Pakistan support a relatively large population of
   wild ungulates, the preferred prey of sympatric carnivores. The Asiatic
   ibex (Capra Ibex Sibirica) is one such an ungulate species which also
   serves as an important trophy animal. The maintenance of trophy hunting
   programs rely on estimates of harvestable population sizes derived from
   rigorous methods. The present study successfully used the double
   observer-based Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) method to produce a reliable
   and accurate estimate of the Asiatic ibex population in the Community
   Control Hunting Areas (CCHAs) of Socterabad, Gojal watershed and
   Khunjerab National Park (KNP). Surveys were conducted from February to
   March 2018 and from March to April 2019. The total ibex population was
   calculated to be 1075 individuals (95\%CI +/- 670) with a density of
   1.43 ibex/km(2) in Gojal watershed, followed by Socterabad with 856
   individuals (95\%CI +/- 680) and a density of 6.24ibex/km(2), and lastly
   KNP with 463 individuals (95\%CI +/- 93.5) and a density of
   0.14ibex/km(2). A total of 52 herds were sighted in Gojal watershed with
   mean size of 19 ibex/herd (SE +/- 3.2). In Socterabad, 28 herds were
   sighted with mean size of 16.07 ibex/herd (SE +/- 2.4) and in KNP 28
   herds were sighted with average recorded size of 16.5 ibex/herd (SE +/-
   3.4). In KNP Sex ratios of female to young, female to yearling and
   female to male were 1:0.7,1:0.4, and 1:0.5 respectively. The detection
   probability of observer two was less than observer one. Ibex biomass
   recorded is insufficient for current recorded snow leopard (Panthera
   uncia) and wolf (Canis lupus) population in the area. Our study
   validates the use of Capture Mark Recapture as a viable tool in
   discerning ungulate populations, and shows that the population of the
   Asiatic ibex is viable in the study area, making it suitable for trophy
   hunting programs but need to modify the hunting law. (C) 2020 Published

Title = {Using citizen-collected wildlife sightings to predict traffic strike hot
   spots for threatened species: a case study on the southern cassowary},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Assessing the causal factors underpinning the distribution and abundance
   of wildlife road-induced mortality can be challenging. This is
   particularly ubiquitous for rare or elusive species, because traffic
   strikes occur infrequently for these populations and information about
   localized abundance, distribution and movements are generally lacking.
   Here, we assessed whether citizen-collected sightings data may serve as
   a low cost and efficient means of gathering long-term animal roadside
   presence and road-crossing information, which could then be used to
   assess the causative factors and direct mitigation actions aimed at
   reducing wildlife traffic strike frequency. We explored this principle
   using two decades of traffic strike records and citizen-collected
   sightings of the southern cassowary Casuarius casuarius johnsonii. Roads
   have bisected the cassowaries' rain forest habitat and despite
   considerable investment into mitigation strategies for this species,
   road-induced mortality is considered one of the primary threatening
   processes affecting the population. Using a Bayesian approach and
   controlling for spatial autocorrelation with conditional autoregressive
   models, we demonstrate that traffic strikes are primarily a
   density-dependent process in the southern cassowary. That is, traffic
   strike clusters occurred along stretches of road where cassowaries were
   most frequently sighted. There were, however, road stretches where
   traffic strike frequency was greater than predicted by the number of
   roadside sightings, illustrating when and where density-independent
   processes increased the mortality potential for a road-crossing
   cassowary.Synthesis and applications. This is the first time that
   citizen-collected sightings data have been used to systematically inform
   upon the abundance and distribution of wildlife traffic strike. The
   technique not only predicts where incidents are likely to occur but also
   helps us to understand the factors responsible for strike clustering.
   While not a replacement for systematic surveys, we highlight
   citizen-collected sightings data as a low-cost option when assessing
   contributing factors to vehicle-induced mortality. Accounting for
   density-dependent and density-independent processes will ensure the most
   effective allocation of resources when implementing wildlife traffic
   strike mitigation.},

Title = {Track surveys do not provide accurate or precise lion density estimates
   in serengeti},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {More than 60\% of the world's large carnivore species are threatened
   with extinction. Enumerating species abundance is critical for assessing
   their conservation status in response to anthropogenic threats and
   environmental stochasticity. Track surveys are commonly used to estimate
   abundance and density of large carnivore species, including lions
   (Panthera leo), but their suitability for estimating species abundance
   has been challenged. Recently developed regression models for track
   surveys of African large carnivores offer improvements over previous
   density estimators but have not been independently validated. We
   conducted weekly track surveys for lions in southeastern Serengeti
   National Park during 2015-2016 and applied one of these recent
   regression models, comparing corresponding lion densities to an
   independent density estimate in 2015 derived from a repeated call-in
   survey conducted during the same season. We surveyed 3289 km for tracks
   in total with overall lion densities of 41.2 (95\% confidence limits
   {[}CL] = 31.9-57.9)/100 km(2) in 2015 and 34.6 (26.8-46.0)/100 km(2) in
   2016. Within year point estimates of lion density varied up to 56\%
   among weeks, though 95\% CLs overlapped. Overall annual CLs from the
   track survey in 2015 did not overlap with the 95\% credible interval
   from the estimate of lion density using a repeated call-in survey (14.36
   lions/100 km(2); 95\% Crl = 9.04-29.31), suggesting overestimation of
   lion densities using track surveys in 2015. High between-year and among
   week variation in density estimates from track surveys suggests that
   lion use of roads for movement varied over time and that other factors
   (e.g., prey distribution, luminosity) influenced lion movements
   independent of road distributions. We recommend caution when applying
   current track survey methods for estimating lion density and support
   application of survey designs that include direct observation of lions
   (e.g., call-in surveys), account for imperfect detection in a
   spatially-explicit framework, and incorporate environmental variables
   (e.g., prey, land cover) that can influence lion space use and
   movements. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Induced dispersal in wildlife management: experimental evaluation of the

Abstract = {Management practices often aim to increase the level of gene flow by
   either: introducing animals from captive breeding programs,
   translocating animals from abundant areas, or increasing the chance of
   animals dispersing between populations by creating habitat corridors.
   These practices provide opportunity for the hybrid offspring of
   introduced and resident animals to experience either increased fitness
   (hybrid vigor) or decreased fitness (hybrid breakdown). There is very
   little quantitative data available to adequately assess whether
   hybridization is likely to be beneficial or detrimental to populations
   managed in these ways. Using Drosophila melanogaster populations, we
   conducted two experiments that simulate the common management practices
   of translocation and wildlife habitat corridors. We monitored the
   frequency and magnitude of hybrid vigor and hybrid breakdown in F1
   hybrids to assess the relative risks and benefits to populations and
   also monitored net productivity (number of adults produced from
   controlled crosses) to assess whether the populations were stable or in
   decline. In the translocation experiment, we observed instances of both
   significant hybrid vigor and hybrid breakdown, both occurring at a
   frequency of 9\%. In the habitat corridor experiments, populations with
   moderate to high dispersal (1-4\% per generation) did not develop
   significant hybrid vigor or hybrid breakdown. However, of the
   populations experiencing low dispersal (0.25\% per generation) for 34
   generations, 6\% displayed significant hybrid vigor and 6\% displayed
   significant hybrid breakdown. These results suggest that in first
   generation hybrids there may be limited opportunity to utilize hybrid
   vigor as a tool to increase the short-term viability of populations
   because there is an equal likelihood of encountering hybrid breakdown
   that may drive the population into further decline. However, our results
   apply only to populations of moderate size (N = 50; N (e) = 14.3) in the
   absence of deliberate consanguineous mating. Lastly, we observed that
   net productivity was positively correlated with dispersal rate,
   suggesting that initial F1 declines in fitness may be temporary and that
   it is preferable to maintain high levels of selectable variation via
   induced dispersal to assist the long-term survival of vulnerable
   populations.},

Abstract = {Radio-collars and other radio-marking devices have been invaluable tools
   for wildlife managers for >40 years. These marking devices have improved
   our understanding of wildlife spatial ecology and demographic parameters
   and provided new data facilitating model development for species
   conservation and management. Although these tools have been used on
   virtually all North American ungulates, their deployment on feral horses
   (Equus ferus caballus) or burros (E. asinus) has been limited. To
   determine if radio-collars and radio-tags could be safely deployed on
   feral equids, we conducted a 1-year observational study in 2015 to
   investigate fit and wear of radio-collars on feral horses and burros
   kept in pastures/pens at the Bureau of Land Management contracted
   adoption facility in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, USA. We assessed the impact
   of radio-collars and transmitter tags on individual behavior, body
   condition, and evaluated neck surface for effects. We tested 2
   radio-collar shapes (teardrop and oval) and a radio-tag (i.e., avian
   backpack) braided into the mane and tail of horses. Behavior of mares
   did not differ between radio-collared (n = 12) and control (uncollared;
   n = 12) individuals. Despite the small sample size, collared burro
   jennies (n = 4) spent more time standing than controls (n = 4).
   Stallions wearing radio-collars (n = 9) fed less, moved less, and stood
   more than controls (n = 8). During the study, we did not detect injuries
   to the necks of mares or burro jennies, but stallions developed small
   sores (that healed while still wearing radio-collars and re-haired
   within 3 months). Two radio-collars occasionally flipped forward over
   the ears onto the foreheads of stallions. Although our study confirmed
   that radio-collars could be safely deployed on captive mares and
   jennies, stallions proved challenging for a variety of reasons. While
   our conclusions were optimistic, longer studies will be required to
   ensure radio-collar safety on free-ranging feral horses and burros.},

Title = {The invasiveness of Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) is characterized
   by habitat and differing herbivore assemblages in its native and invaded
   range},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},

Abstract = {A significant challenge of global change is the human-mediated movement
   of pasture grasses and their subsequent impact on ecosystem processes
   when they become invasive. We must understand invasive grass ecology and
   their natural enemies in native and introduced ranges to mitigate these
   impacts. Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) is a pantropically
   introduced pasture grass that escapes intended areas and invades native
   ecosystems - threatening biodiversity and ecosystem function. The
   success of invasive plants has of-ten been attributed to ecological
   release from stressors, including natural enemies and resource
   availability. Our objective was to assess Guinea grass functional traits
   across three different habitat types in native and invaded ranges by
   documenting ungulate and arthropod abundance, diversity, and feeding
   guilds. Guinea grass functional traits were assessed in three habitat
   types: grassland, riparian, and woody thickets around nitrogen-fixing
   Prosopis glandulosa in its introduced range in Texas, USA, and Senegalia
   mellifera in its native range in Kenya. We characterized Guinea grass
   functional traits by measuring plant height, cover, biomass,
   root-to-shoot ratios, and reproductive traits. We then examined the
   phytophagous arthropod and ungulate abundance and feeding guild
   diversity across the three habitat types. We hypothesized that
   functional trait expression related to invasiveness would be associated
   with Guinea grass in its introduced range. Also, we hypothesized that
   the abundance and diversity of phytophagous arthropods and ungulates
   would be lower in the invaded range. Finally, we hypothesized that
   Guinea grass functional traits would differ between the three habitat
   types, given the habitat types' innate differences in resource
   availability. We found that Guinea grass was 2.5 times taller and 3.3
   times more productive and covered 2.5 times more area in its invaded
   versus native ranges. Introduced Guinea grass had higher reproduction
   rates with 2.5 times more reproductive tillers, while habitat type drove
   vegetative reproduction with 15 times more stoloniferous establishment
   in wooded and riparian sites than grasslands. Texan ungulate communities
   were less species-rich, less functionally diverse, and less abundant
   than the Kenyan ungulate community. The phytophagous arthropod diversity
   on plants was twice as high on Kenyan Guinea grass than on Texan Guinea
   grass. Total arthropod family richness was nearly double, with 15
   families represented in Kenya and 8 in Texas. These results suggest that
   Guinea grass has escaped a rich assemblage of arthropods and ungulates
   and likely explains some of its spread in introduced ranges. This study
   demonstrates how the invasive success of Guinea grass can be understood
   in terms of its competitive ability and interaction with natural enemies
   in the introduced and native ranges and may inform future biological
   control.},

Title = {Tree cavity availability across forest, park, and residential habitats

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Tree cavities are used by a wide variety of species for nesting, food
   storage, and cover. Most studies on cavity availability have been
   conducted in forests, and little is known about urban areas. With
   urbanization, species that excavate cavities may be less abundant,
   natural tree-decay processes are managed, and tree densities are
   reduced, all of which may influence tree-cavity availability. We
   investigated three questions: 1) What is the prevalence of tree cavities
   in different habitats in the Chicago area? 2) How do the characteristics
   of natural and woodpecker-excavated cavities and cavity-trees differ
   across habitats? 3) How does the urban landscape influence the
   prevalence of tree cavities? We tested the capacity for large urban
   parks and residential areas to provide tree cavities at levels similar
   to forested areas. We surveyed 1,545 trees in these three habitats for
   excavated and natural (caused by decay) cavities. Cavities were most
   available in forests, where the density of trees was highest. We found
   that a similar proportion of trees in forests and parks had excavated
   cavities, but excavated cavities were rare in residential areas. Trees
   containing cavities were larger than control trees and had more decay,
   and excavated cavities were in larger trees with more decay than natural
   cavity trees. Canopy cover was the main landscape variable influencing
   excavated cavity availability. Our results suggest that the prevalence
   of tree cavities may not be a limiting factor for urban wildlife,
   however that is contingent on the levels of use of natural cavities,
   which is currently unknown.},

Abstract = {Large carnivore reintroductions have become commonplace in modern
   conservation. Despite the benefits of such initiatives, conflict with
   humans can jeopardize their success. Reintroductions of grey wolves
   (Canis lupus) in the American West are particularly polarizing, and
   opposing views are often popularized through visual media. We examined
   public billboards, both for and against wolves, in eastern Washington
   State. We used social science concepts-framing, affect, and the
   psychology of advertising-to assess the billboards' role in the wolf
   debate. We analyzed visual imagery, traced frames in newspaper articles,
   and conducted interviews with local stakeholders. Our results showed
   that the billboards attracted attention to the issue and increased
   tension within the debate. However, they were limited in their ability
   to stimulate engagement due to a discrepancy between their structure and
   intended impacts. Results suggested the necessity for careful selection
   of campaign techniques and focused alignment of imagery and frames.},

Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflicts have grown in Brazil over the past 10 years.
   There has been a dramatic increase in the number, diversity of species
   involved, and even in the severity of outcomes. This growth is
   attributed to several factors: expanding human settlement, growth of
   outdoor recreation, and increase in the number of species that have
   adapted to living in human dominated landscapes. Managing these species
   is complicated by the growing diversity of wildlife values among
   different publics. We describe conflicts involving jaguars, pumas,
   capybaras (associated with agricultural damage, vehicle collisions, and
   transmission of disease) and wild boars (a spreading exotic species
   involving issues of hunting/antihunting). Two critical needs are
   identified: (a) Move from a conservation to a management paradigm, where
   there is need to reduce populations, rather than the conventional
   situation where the population was expected to increase and (b) Apply
   interdisciplinary approaches with particular attention to bringing in
   the social sciences.},

Title = {Predicting spatial extent of invasive earthworms on an oceanic island},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1013-1023},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Aim Invasions of non-native earthworms into previously earthworm-free
   regions are a major conservation concern because they alter ecosystems
   and threaten biological diversity. Little information is available,
   however, about effects of earthworm invasions outside of temperate and
   boreal forests, particularly about invasions of islands. For San
   Clemente Island (SCI), California (USA) - an oceanic island with
   numerous endemic and endangered plant and vertebrate species - we
   assessed the spatial extent and drivers of earthworm invasion and
   examined relationships between earthworms and plant and soil microbial
   communities.
   Location San Clemente Island, southern California, USA.
   Methods Using a stratified random sampling approach, we sampled
   earthworms, vegetation, soils and microbial communities across SCI. We
   examined the relationship between the presence of invasive earthworms
   and soil and landscape variables using logistic regression models and
   implemented a spatial representation of the best model to represent
   potential site suitability for earthworms. We evaluated the relationship
   between invasive earthworms and vegetation and microbial variables using
   ANOVA.
   Results We found that the likelihood of encountering earthworms
   increased close to roads and streams and in high moisture conditions,
   which correspond to higher elevation and a north-eastern aspect on SCI.
   The presence of earthworms was positively associated with total ground
   vegetation cover, grass cover and non-native plant cover; however, there
   was no significant relationship between earthworms and microbial
   biomass. These results suggest that the earthworm invasion on SCI is at
   an early stage and closely tied to roads and high moisture conditions.
   Main conclusions Climatic variables and potential sources of earthworm
   introduction and dispersal (e.g. roads and streams) should be broadly
   useful for predicting current and future sites of earthworm invasions on
   both islands and continents. Furthermore, the significant positive
   relationship between non-native plant cover and invasive earthworm
   presence raises the possibility of an emerging invasional `meltdown' on
   SCI. Additional study of earthworm invasions on human-inhabited oceanic
   islands is necessary to identify additional invasions and their
   potential for negative impacts on unique insular biota.},

Title = {Understanding farmers' reasons behind mitigation decisions is key in
   supporting their coexistence with wildlife},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1305-1318},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Coexistence between wildlife and farmers can be challenging and can
   endanger the lives of both, prompting the provisioning of mitigation
   methods by governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
   However, provision of materials, demonstration of the effectiveness of
   methods or willingness to uptake a method do not predict uptake of
   methods. We used ethnographic decision models to understand how farmers'
   work through the decisions of uptake or non-uptake of methods to
   mitigate crop consumption by elephants, and how the government and NGOs
   can either enable or impede the ability of farmers to protect themselves
   and their crops. While farmers were motivated to use methods if they
   received or could afford to buy materials and they believed in the
   effectiveness of the methods, they still did not use them if they
   considered a method to be dangerous, or issues with elephants not to be
   severe enough, or when the supply of materials or income was not
   sufficient. Methods were not even considered by farmers if they lacked
   awareness or knowledge of the method. Government departments and NGOs
   enabled farmers to mitigate elephant crop consumption by providing
   opportunities for cash income, and providing materials and knowledge.
   Yet, there was disparity between the materials farmers received and
   methods they wished to adopt. One-off inputs of materials did not result
   in sustainable use of mitigation methods. We see an opportunity for
   governmental departments or NGOs to stimulate logistics (e.g. roads and
   retail) to increase availability of mitigation materials since this
   promoted farmer autonomy. We also highlight the importance of empowering
   farmers by facilitating within community sharing of mitigation ideas and
   increasing knowledge about the effectiveness of promising wildlife
   conscious farming, as despite promising farmer testimonies, only a few
   farmers used these techniques. Read the free Plain Language Summary for

Title = {Assessing wildfire vulnerability of vegetated serpentine soils in the
   Balkan peninsula},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The endemic vegetation on serpentine soils is remarkably diverse and
   usually of low productivity and recovers slowly after major disturbances
   like wildfires and subsequent runoff, erosion, and landslides. Climate
   change and anthropogenic factors may increase the vulnerability of these
   ecosystems to disturbances with social and ecological consequences. The
   assessment of wildfire risks of these habitats is crucial for a targeted
   management to protect ecological, agricultural, and urban systems. The
   major goal of this study is to highlight the importance and utility of
   wildfire risk assessment for sustainable management of serpentine soils
   and the related vegetation cover. In this paper we present an example
   from Albania where the coverage of serpentine soils (11.2\%) is about
   four times higher than the global average (3\%). We used the wildfire
   ignition probability index (WIPI) and wildfire spreading capacity index
   (WSCI) as wildfire risk indicators. WIPI values were more evenly
   distributed while higher WSCI values were mostly concentrated in remote,
   high-elevation areas. The inner areas within serpentine soils were at
   lower risk regarding wildfire ignition, while higher values were found
   at the borders of serpentine soils that are closer to urban and
   residential areas. The distribution of normalized wildfire risk indices
   by vegetation type showed that overall habitats covered by
   sclerophyllous vegetation had the highest risk for wildfire ignition,
   followed by forested areas, while moors and heathland had the lowest
   risk. On the other hand, the WSCI was higher for forested areas,
   especially broad-leaved, coniferous, and mixed forests. Higher WIPI and
   WSCI values were associated with municipalities with less resources to
   mitigate the consequences for wildlife and implement preventive
   measures. According to our study, considerable surfaces of vegetation
   covering the serpentine soils in Albania are exposed to significant
   wildfire ignition and spreading risks. We argue that these areas need to
   be considered for a special protection status. This would facilitate a
   proper management of this unique soil type and improve the conservation
   of these fragile ecosystems.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal dynamics in habitat suitability of a large Arctic
   herbivore: Environmental heterogeneity is key to a sedentary lifestyle},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {18},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Quantifying spatial and temporal variation in habitat suitability is
   crucial to understand changes in animal distribution and to inform
   conservation and management initiatives, especially for species
   occupying regions profoundly impacted by climatic and environmental
   change. A detailed understanding of the environmental conditions shaping
   seasonal habitat suitability of free-ranging muskoxen (Ovibos
   moschatus), a key species in the Arctic tundra ecosystem, is currently
   lacking. We applied the maximum entropy modelling algorithm (MaxEnt) to
   build seasonal species distribution models (SDMs) over four years to
   quantify variation in habitat suitability in time and space. Suitable
   habitat was predicted based on location data from 27 GPS-collared adult
   female muskoxen in northeast Greenland and the spatial distribution of
   topographic variables and landcover within the study area. Overall, our
   results highlight distinct seasonal differences in both the spatial
   extent and distribution of suitable muskox habitat. Suitable space was
   smallest and spatially most clustered during autumn, and increased in
   extent and dispersion throughout the snow-covered period until peaking
   in summer. Nonetheless, the importance of environmental variables
   influencing habitat suitability was consistent across inter-annual and
   seasonal scales as habitat suitability was consistently predicted to be
   highest in vegetated, flat to moderately rugged terrain at low to medium
   elevation (<500-600 m.a.s.l.) close to the coast (<5-10 km). One year
   with extraordinary large amounts of snow differed from the general
   pattern, exhibiting markedly smaller areas of suitable habitat and
   higher spatial clustering. The results support the notion that adult
   female muskoxen are able to lead a relatively sedentary lifestyle due to
   the close proximity of suitable habitats across all seasons. However,
   above-average snow depths appear to be a potential bottleneck limiting
   access to suitable habitat, with consequences even beyond the
   snow-covered season. Our study provides the foundation for assessing
   potential future changes in habitat suitability and distribution of this
   key Arctic herbivore. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Estimating Waterfowl Carrying Capacity at Local Scales: A Case Study
   from Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, New Jersey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The management of wintering North American waterfowl is based on the
   premise that the amount of foraging habitat can limit populations. To
   estimate carrying capacity of winter habitats, managers use bioenergetic
   models to quantify energy (food) availability and energy demand, and use
   results as planning tools to meet regional conservation objectives.
   Regional models provide only coarse estimates of carrying capacity
   because habitat area, habitat energy values, and temporal trends in
   population-level demand are difficult to quantify precisely at large
   scales. We took advantage of detailed data previously collected on
   wintering waterfowl at Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge and
   surrounding marsh, New Jersey, USA, and created a well-constrained local
   model of carrying capacity. We used 1,223 core samples collected between
   2006 and 2015 to estimate available food. We used species-specific 24-h
   timeactivity data collected between 2011 and 2013 to estimate daily
   energy expenditure, morphometrically corrected for site-and day-specific
   thermoregulatory costs. To estimate population-level energy demand, we
   used standardized monthly ground-surveys (2005-2014) to create a
   migration curve, and proportionally scaled that to fit aerial survey
   data (2005-2014). Crucially, we also explicitly incorporated estimates
   of variance in all of these parameters and conducted a sensitivity
   analysis to diagnose the most important sources of variation in the
   model. Our results indicated that at estimated mean levels of supply
   (2.34 x 10(9) kcal) and cumulative demand (3.4 x 10(9) kcal), refuge
   resources were depleted before the end of the wintering season. However,
   at one standard error greater in supply and one standard error less in
   demand, 1.33 x 10(9) kcal remained on the landscape at the end of
   winter. Variation in model output appeared to be driven primarily by
   uncertainty in food abundance in high marsh habitats. This model allows
   for relative assessment of biases and uncertainties in carrying capacity
   modeling, and serves as a framework identifying critical science needs
   to improve local and regional waterfowl management planning.},

Title = {Mapping watershed integrity for the conterminous United States},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {85},
Pages = {1133-1148},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Watershed integrity is the capacity of a watershed to support and
   maintain the full range of ecological processes and functions essential
   to sustainability. Using information from EPA's StreamCat dataset, we
   calculated and mapped an Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) for 2.6
   million watersheds in the conterminous US with first-order
   approximations of relationships between stressors and six watershed
   functions: hydrologic regulation, regulation of water chemistry,
   sediment regulation, hydrologic connectivity, temperature regulation,
   and habitat provision. Results show high integrity in the western US,
   intermediate integrity in the southern and eastern US, and the lowest
   integrity in the temperate plains and lower Mississippi Valley.
   Correlation between the six functional components was high (r =
   0.85-0.98). A related Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) was developed
   using local drainages of individual stream segments (i.e., excluding
   upstream information). We evaluated the ability of the IWI and ICI to
   predict six continuous site-level indicators with regression analyses
   three biological indicators and principal components derived from water
   quality, habitat, and combined water quality and habitat variables using
   data from EPA's National Rivers and Streams Assessment. Relationships
   were highly significant, but the IWI only accounted for 1-12\% of the
   variation in the four biological and habitat variables. The IWI
   accounted for over 25\% of the variation in the water quality and
   combined principal components nationally, and 32-39\% in the Northern
   and Southern Appalachians. We also used multinomial logistic regression
   to compare the IWI with the categorical forms of the three biological
   indicators. Results were consistent: we found positive associations but
   modest results. We compared how the IWI and ICI predicted the water
   quality PC relative to agricultural and urban land use. The IWI or ICI
   are the best predictors of the water quality PC for the CONUS and six of
   the nine ecoregions, but they only perform marginally better than
   agriculture in most instances. However, results suggest that agriculture
   would not be appropriate in all parts of the country, and the index is
   meant to be responsive to all stressors. The IWI in its present form
   (available through the StreamCat website;
   https://www.cpa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat) could
   be useful for management efforts at multiple scales, especially when
   combined with information on site condition. The IWI could be improved
   by incorporating empirical or literature-derived relationships between
   functional components and stressors. However, limitations concerning the
   absence of data for certain stressors should be considered.},

Title = {Abundance trends for river macroinvertebrates vary across taxa, trophic
   group and river typology},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Abstract = {There is mounting evidence that terrestrial arthropods are declining
   rapidly in many areas of the world. It is unclear whether freshwater
   invertebrates, which are key providers of ecosystem services, are also
   declining. We addressed this question by analysing a long-term dataset
   of macroinvertebrate abundance collected from 2002 to 2019 across 5009
   sampling sites in English rivers. Patterns varied markedly across
   taxonomic groups. Within trophic groups we detected increases in the
   abundance of carnivores by 19\% and herbivores by 14.8\%, while we
   estimated decomposers have declined by 21.7\% in abundance since 2002.
   We also found heterogeneity in trends across rivers belonging to
   different typologies based on geological dominance and catchment
   altitude, with organic lowland rivers having generally higher rates of
   increase in abundance across taxa and trophic groups, with siliceous
   lowland rivers having the most declines. Our results reveal a complex
   picture of change in freshwater macroinvertebrate abundance between
   taxonomic groups, trophic levels and river typologies. Our analysis
   helps with identifying priority regions for action on potential
   environmental stressors where we discover macroinvertebrate abundance
   declines.},

Abstract = {Military personnel and affiliates have significant buying power that can
   influence demand for wildlife products. Purchase and transport of
   certain wildlife products violates United States laws, military
   regulations, and national country laws where the items were purchased.
   We surveyed military bazaars (n = 4) in Kabul, Afghanistan from June
   2007 to March 2009 to observe which species were available to soldiers.
   In June 2008, we conducted a pilot survey of U.S. Army personnel (n =
   371) stationed at Fort Drum, New York, USA, who had been deployed or
   stationed overseas including in Afghanistan and Iraq. Soldiers reported
   skins of wild felids and gray wolf Canis lupus as most commonly observed
   wildlife products available for sale in Afghanistan. Forty percent of
   respondents said they had either purchased or seen other members of the
   military purchase or use wildlife products. The U.S. military was
   willing to assist in curtailing supply and demand for wildlife products
   in order to protect soldiers from unknowingly breaking the law and to
   conserve wildlife in the countries where they serve. Regular, focused
   training of military personnel should be considered an important step to
   reducing trade in wildlife products by addressing both demand and market
   supply.},

Title = {Trophic guild and forest type explain phyllostomid bat abundance
   variation from human habitat disturbance},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {25},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The loss of tropical forest cover caused by land-use change is causing
   changes in populations of animal trophic guilds, including those
   belonging to Phyllostomidae bat species. They fulfill important
   ecosystem functions such as pollination, seed dispersion, and
   regulations of vertebrate and invertebrate populations in Neotropical
   forests and human disturbed habitats. However, the effect of habitat
   disturbance on the abundance of phyllostomid bats is still
   controversial, and it is unknown if this effect presents a phylogenetic
   signal, or if this abundance is influenced by the type of forest where
   the disturbance occurs or by the distance between disturbed habitat and
   conserved forest. In order to answer these new questions, an exhaustive
   literature review was performed followed by a series of meta-analyzes.
   We found 26 studies from which 829 cases (i.e. species observations; k)
   were extracted. Each case reported the number of individuals captured in
   the disturbed habitat and in the conserved forest. As effect size, the
   bat proportion in disturbed habitats was used. We did not use
   phylogenetic correction in the meta-analysis because we did not find a
   phylogenetic signal in the bat proportion in disturbed habitats. We
   found that omnivorous, carnivorous, insectivorous and hematophagous bats
   were sensitive to habitat disturbance, while phytophagous were tolerant.
   In addition, the type of habitat disturbance and the type of forest
   where it occurs explain the differences of bat abundance within each
   trophic guild. Finally, there was no effect of the type of crop, the age
   of the secondary forest, and the distance to a conserved forest on
   trophic guild bat abundance in disturbed habitats. These results could
   focus the conservation efforts of phyllostomid bats and the ecosystem
   services they provide in both anthropogenic and conserved habitats. (c)

Title = {Pangolin trade in the Mong La wildlife market and the role of Myanmar in
   the smuggling of pangolins into China},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {118-126},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We report on the illegal trade in live pangolins, their meat, and their
   scales in the Special Development Zone of Mong La, Shan State, Myanmar,
   on the border with China, and present an analysis of the role of Myanmar
   in the trade of pangolins into China. Mong La caters exclusively for the
   Chinese market and is best described as a Chinese enclave in Myanmar. We
   surveyed the morning market, wildlife trophy shops and wild meat
   restaurants during four visits in 2006, 2009, 2013-2014, and 2015. We
   observed 42 bags of scales, 32 whole skins, 16 foetuses or pangolin
   parts in wine, and 27 whole pangolins for sale. Our observations suggest
   Mong La has emerged as a significant hub of the pangolin trade. The
   origin of the pangolins is unclear but it seems to comprise a mixture of
   pangolins from Myanmar and neighbouring countries, and potentially
   African countries. Myanmar, on the basis of its geographic position,
   size and weak government, has emerged as an important transit country
   for the smuggling of pangolins to China. Data from 29 seizures from
   Myanmar and 23 from neighbouring countries (Thailand, India, China)
   implicating Myanmar as a source of pangolins or as a transit point for
   pangolins sourced in other countries, in the period 2010-2014,
   illustrate the magnitude of this trade. Combined these seizures amount
   to 4339 kg of scales and 518 whole pangolins, with a retail value in
   Myanmar of US\$3.09 million. Trade in pangolins, their parts of their
   derivatives is illegal in Myanmar and CITES II listing with a zero-quota
   preclude international trade in them. We urge the Myanmar government to
   liaise with regional authorities to curb the trade in pangolins and
   recommend that the Myanmar and Chinese CITES authorities in particular
   come together urgently as to resolve the illicit trade of pangolins and
   their parts across their borders. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Population genetic structure in a rapidly expanding mesocarnivore:
   golden jackals in the Dinaric-Pannonian region},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Species range expansions and (re)colonization of landscapes variously
   dominated by humans occur on a global scale. Understanding such range
   enlargements and subsequent changes in the composition of ecological
   communities is important for conservation management, and the golden
   jackal (Canis aureus) can be considered a model species for regional and
   continental range expansion. Although this mesopredator has been known
   from the Adriatic Coast of southeastern Europe for over 500 years, the
   species is a recent arrival further north, including in Slovenia where
   jackals were first confirmed in the 1950s. Research from eastern Italy
   found jackals with ancestry from the Dalmatian region on the Adriatic
   Coast and the Pannonian region further east. We predicted similar
   ancestry for Slovenian jackals, and examined samples from Croatia,
   including Dalmatia and interior regions, Serbia, Hungary, and Slovenia
   with 25 microsatellite markers to determine population genetic
   structure. We detected two distinct genetic clusters, representing the
   Dalmatian and Balkan-Pannonian (Pannonian) jackal populations (F-ST =
   0.157, 95\% CI: 0.112-0.209). Contrary to expectations, only few
   individuals in Slovenia exhibited signs of Dalmatian ancestry, and none
   appeared to be direct immigrants. Some results suggested a third cluster
   centered in northern Hungary. These divergent profiles might indicate
   immigration from outside the study area, and samples from regions
   further east are required for additional resolution. Based on our
   results, we hypothesize that Dalmatia has not been a substantial source
   for recent range expansion of the species, which has likely occurred
   from the east. Further investigation can help resolve the ancestry and
   current distribution of the Dalmatian and Pannonian populations, and the
   ecological relationships resulting from progressively overlapping
   distributions of canid species. Finally, genomic research could
   illuminate whether genetic variants from eastern areas might have
   facilitated jackal expansion into regions characterized by a colder
   climate, the presence of snow, and extensive forest cover; habitats
   seemingly avoided by the jackals occupying the Adriatic Coast and
   surrounding areas in southeastern Europe.},

Title = {Trends in demography, genetics, and social structure of Przewalski's
   horses in the Hortobagy National Park, Hungary over the last 22 years},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {25},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The world population of Przewalski's horses has recovered from very few
   survivors, and is still categorized as ``Endangered{''} in the IUCN Red
   List of Threatened Species. For this reason, the maintenance of
   genetically valuable populations is highly important. The 3000 ha
   Pentezug Reserve in Hortobagy National Park, Hungary, was home to 270
   Przewalski's horses at the end of 2018, approximately 30\% of the total
   European population. In this study, we show the main changes in
   demographic, genetic, and social characteristics of the population since
   the establishment of the reserve in 1997. The first years clearly
   demonstrated that the steppe ecosystem and the wetlands in this area
   were ideal for the population. We observed that the growing number of
   individuals affected the total number of harems, but not the average
   size of the harems. Remarkably, a new phenomenon, herd formation, also
   appeared. The number of foals per year increased for 17 years (the
   zenith was in 2014, N = 60 per year) then started to decrease due to
   both non-human factors (e.g. delay in female fecundity and decreasing
   foaling rate) and human intervention (e.g. immunocontraception
   treatment). The total number of horses peaked in 2017 (N = 328) and in
   2018 decreased (N = 276) due to decreasing foaling rate, exports, and a
   population crash. The inbreeding coefficient increased slightly after
   2012, while gene diversity stabilized at a relatively high value. Today
   many individuals from this well-monitored population can be found in
   Russia and Mongolia. Collectively, understanding of the social structure
   and mechanisms of population self-control in Przewalski's horses is
   improved by our observations. From a population management point of
   view, our study highlights the importance of human interventions for
   birth-control and interactions between Przewalski's horse projects in
   different countries. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {During a period of 12 months in 2007 and 2008, a study of the parrot
   trade within Peru was carried out. In this study, 20 main wildlife
   markets were visited in eight cities in order to estimate the number of
   parrot species and individuals traded legally and illegally within a
   year. The study also gathered extra information from vendors and
   customers through informal interviews about the trade process.
   Additionally we contracted one person in two markets between February
   and May 2008 to monitor how many species and individuals entered the
   trade. During the study, four threatened species (the `Endangered'
   Gray-cheeked Parakeet Brotogeris pyrrhoptera, the `Vulnerable' Military
   Macaw Ara militaris, the `Vulnerable' Yellow-faced Parrotlet Forpus
   xanthops and the `Near Threatened' Red-masked Parakeet Aratinga
   erythrogenys) and one additional species listed in CITES Appendix 1
   (Scarlet Macaw Ara macao) were found being traded. Thirty-four species
   were recorded in total, 33 of which are native to Peru (representing
   63\% of the 52 known Peruvian parrot species) and one of which (Monk
   Parakeet Myiopsitta monachus) is native to Bolivia and Argentina. Our
   results show that even for the seven species which can be legally traded
   in Peru, the number of individuals being traded can greatly exceed the
   numbers that can officially be traded legally. We directly counted 4,722
   parrots for sale and using a measured detection rate of 3\% we estimate
   a total market size in the cities surveyed of between 80,000 and 90,000
   individuals. As our surveys sampled only 8 out of Peru's 24 departmental
   capitals and there are also other large cities, these numbers are likely
   to represent only a part of the total trade in Peru. To the best of our
   knowledge this is one of the first detailed studies of the internal
   trade in a source country for the international parrot trade. Our
   results suggest that such internal trade is likely to be a significant
   conservation issue that has previously been largely overlooked.},

Abstract = {Human-mediated changes in habitat structure may disturb predator-prey
   relationships. We investigated the influence of perimeter fences on the
   diet of a reintroduced population of African wild dogs Lycaon pictus
   Temminck 1820 in a 316 km(2), fenced reserve in South Africa, by
   tracking radio-collared individuals during hunting periods to determine
   dietary composition from observed kills. Nutritional status of impala
   Aepyceros melampus and kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros prey, as measured
   by the percentage of femur marrow fat, was significantly lower than that
   of unselectively culled individuals. This supports the hypothesis that
   wild dog predation is at least partially compensatory. Fence-impeded
   kills (those for which escape was deemed to be compromised by the fence)
   comprised 40.5\% of kills (n = 316), and 54.1\% of all edible biomass
   consumed. Compared with fence-unimpeded kills, fence-impeded kills
   comprised larger species (32.9 vs. 25.0 kg, W = 25667.0, P << 0.001),
   older age classes for one prey category (female kudu: Fisher's exact
   test, P = 0.02, n = 65) and animals in better condition for adult impala
   males (Mann-Whitney, W = 111.0, P = 0.012, n = 28). Fence-impeded kills
   also provided greater catch per unit hunting effort (27.3 vs. 12.2 kg
   km(-1); chi(2) = 7.89, P = 0.005), resulting in longer interkill
   intervals. Movement of the pack towards the fence at the start of each
   hunting period suggested a decision to exploit the advantage that fences
   conferred for capturing prey.Synthesis and applications. By enabling
   coursing predators to capture prey that would otherwise have escaped,
   fences may reduce the compensatory nature of predation, causing shifts
   in predator-prey dynamics that could influence the ability of small
   reserves to support such predators. The establishment of larger
   conservation areas to reduce perimeter-to-area ratios should be
   encouraged to limit the undesired effects of fences on predator-prey
   dynamics.},

Title = {Assessment of Cereal Grain Waste Densities to Aid Waterfowl Conservation

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Postharvest waste seed from cereal grains is a major dietary component
   of waterfowl in the Klamath Basin in northeastern California and
   southeastern Oregon, a region that plays host to over a million
   waterfowl annually. Understanding food abundance is critical to local
   waterfowl management; therefore, we conducted a study in 2008 to
   investigate waste grain densities in barley, oat, and wheat fields. We
   used hierarchal mixed effect models to assess several factors that may
   affect waste grain densities postharvest. We also compared the effects
   of residue management practices to measure the effect of these
   treatments. To understand the scope of postharvest practices, we
   conducted a weekly road survey to document treatments applied to fields
   in our study area. We found that region best explained the variance of
   postharvest waste grain in barley fields, where the Tule Lake region had
   89\% greater densities than Lower Klamath. Neither harvester age nor
   baling affected waste grain in oats fields. In wheat fields, the model
   containing region and lodging ranked highest, where the Tule Lake region
   had 66\% greater waste densities than Lower Klamath, and lodging
   increased waste grain by 70\%. Burning did not reduce waste grain in
   barley or oat fields. Chisel-disking reduced waste grain by 94\% in
   wheat fields compared with postharvest. Our field treatment survey found
   that 70\% of barley fields were untreated while 18\% were disked and
   13\% were burned and flooded. We estimated that 82\% of oat fields were
   burned postharvest, while 18\% were burned and flooded. In wheat, 61\%
   of fields were left untreated, while 16\% were disked, 8\% were
   chisel-plowed, and 7\% were flooded postharvest. Flooding and burning
   occurred primarily on National Wildlife Refuges, while disking,
   chisel-plowing, and postharvest irrigation occurred solely on private
   properties. Our results indicate that reducing tillage treatments would
   boost accessibility of cereal grain food resources to waterfowl in the
   Klamath Basin, and incentives to flood grain fields on private
   properties should be considered for the same purpose when and where
   possible.},

Title = {Forage quality in grazing lawns and tall grasslands in the subtropical
   region of Nepal and implications for wild herbivores},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Subtropical grasslands interspersed in forests often present mosaics of
   tall grasslands and grazing lawns with a high variation in structure,
   biomass and nutrient concentration. However, the impact of such
   variation on forage quality is still poorly known. We quantified
   physical and chemical properties of grasses of grazing lawns and tall
   grasslands, interspersed in the forested region of Bardia National Park,
   Nepal during the hot-dry season. This area falls within Cwaclimate (Ko
   center dot ppen-Geigen climate classification). We found that grasses in
   grazing lawns had an average bulk density of -5400 g.m-3 whereas tall
   grasslands had an average bulk density of -1000 g.m-3 only. Forage in
   grazing lawns was comprised of a higher percentage of green leaf (up to
   60\%) compared to tall grassland (up to 40\%). Phosphorus levels in
   green leaves were below maintenance requirements of wild herbivores
   (especially for grazers and mixed feeders) on both grazing lawns and
   tall grasslands. However, average crude protein levels in green leaves
   from both the grazing lawns and tall grasslands could meet the
   herbivores maintenance requirement (-7\%). Only green leaves on grazing
   lawns had crude protein levels sufficient enough (9.7\%) to meet the
   requirements of herbivores for maintenance and gestation, though not for
   lactation. We conclude that, during the hot-dry season, grazing lawns
   provide forage with a higher quantity and quality than tall grasslands.
   Consequently, grazing lawns can make a significant contribution to the
   maintenance or even growth of the grassland dependent wild ungulate
   population, such as chital (Axis axis), a primary prey species of the
   endangered tiger (Panthera tigris) in Bardia National Park. The insight
   of this study will provide a basis for restoring grazing lawns for
   quality forage, and aid in the conservation and management of wild
   grazers and mixed feeders.},

Title = {Monitoring in the presence of species misidentification: the case of the
   Eurasian lynx in the Alps},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {266-273},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Inferring the distribution and abundance of a species from field records
   must deal with false-negative and false-positive errors. False-negative
   errors occur if a species present goes undetected, while false-positive
   errors are typically a consequence of species misidentification.
   False-positive observations in studies of rare species may cause an
   overestimation of the distribution or abundance of the species and
   distort trend indices. We illustrate this issue with the monitoring of
   the Eurasian lynx in the Alps. We developed a three-level classification
   of field records according to their reliability as inferred from whether
   they were validated or not. The first category (C1) represents hard fact
   data (e.g. dead lynx); the second category (C2) includes confirmed data
   (e.g. tracks verified by an expert); and the third category (C3) are
   unconfirmed data (e.g. any kind of direct visual observation). For lynx,
   which is a comparatively well-known species in the Alps, we use
   site-occupancy modelling to estimate its distribution and show that the
   inferred lynx distribution is highly sensitive to presence sign
   category: it is larger if based on C3 records compared with the more
   reliable C1 and C2 records. We believe that the reason for this is a
   fairly high frequency of false-positive errors among C3 records. This
   suggests that distribution records for many lesser-known species may be
   similarly unreliable, because they are mostly or exclusively based on
   unconfirmed and thus soft data. Nevertheless, such soft data form a
   considerable part of species assessments as presented, for example in
   the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. However, C3
   records can often not be discarded because they may be the only
   information available. When inferring the distribution of rare
   carnivores, especially for species with an expanding or shrinking range,
   we recommend a rigorous discrimination between fully reliable and un- or
   only partly reliable data, in order to identify possible methodological
   problems in the distribution maps related to false-positive records.},

   been seen (the posterior probability). Here, I present a simple Bayesian
   equation that estimates posteriors. It uninterestingly assumes that the
   sampling probability equals the frequency of sightings within the range.
   It interestingly sets the prior probability of going extinct during any
   one time interval (E) by assuming that extinction is an exponential
   decay process and there is a 50\% chance a species has gone extinct by
   the end of its observed range. The range is first adjusted for
   undersampling by using a routine equation. Bayes' theorem is then used
   to compute the posterior for interval 1 (epsilon(1)), which becomes the
   prior for interval 2. The following posterior epsilon(2) again
   incorporates E because extinction might have happened instead during
   interval 2. The posteriors are called ``creeping-shadow-of-a-doubt
   values{''} to emphasize the uniquely iterative nature of the
   calculation. Simulations show that the method is highly accurate and
   precise given moderate to high sampling probabilities and otherwise
   conservative, robust to random variation in sampling, and able to detect
   extinction pulses after a short lag. Improving the method by having it
   consider clustering of sightings makes it highly resilient to trends in
   sampling. Example calculations involving recently extinct Costa Rican
   frogs and Maastrichtian ammonites show that the method helps to evaluate
   the status of critically endangered species and identify species likely
   to have gone extinct below some stratigraphic horizon.},

Title = {Prey and tigers on the forgotten trail: high prey occupancy and tiger
   habitat use reveal the importance of the understudied Churia habitat of
   Nepal},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {593-616},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Tigers are globally threatened and their conservation relies on intact
   habitat that supports key large prey. The Churia habitat is relatively
   unknown even though it occupies a significant portion of the forested
   landscape of the Terai Arc, which stretches over 1000 km in a narrow
   band across Nepal and India, parallel to the Himalayas. To address this
   lack of detailed information relevant to tiger conservation, we used
   sign surveys to estimate occupancy probability for 5 focal prey species
   of tigers (gaur, sambar, chital, wild pig, and barking deer), and assess
   tiger habitat use within 537 km(2) of the understudied Churia habitat in
   Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal. Multi-season occupancy models
   allowed us to make seasonal (winter vs. summer) inferences regarding
   changes in occupancy or habitat use based on covariates influencing
   occupancy and detection. We found that sambar had the largest spatial
   distribution occupying 431-437 km(2), while chital had the smallest at
   100-158 km(2) across both seasons. The gaur population showed the most
   seasonal variation occupying from 413 to 318 km(2), suggesting their
   migration out of the Churia in summer and moving in during winter. Wild
   pigs showed the opposite trend occupying from 444 to 383 km(2);
   suggesting moving into Churia in summer and out in winter. Barking deer
   were widespread in both seasons (329-349 km(2)). Tiger habitat use
   (psi(SE)) was higher in winter 0.63 (0.11) than in summer 0.54 (0.21),
   but confidence intervals overlapped and area used was similar across
   seasons, 337 km(2) (winter) to 291 km(2) (summer). Available habitat,
   distribution of water sources, and human disturbance were the most
   common variables influencing spatial distribution of prey and habitat
   use of tigers at different spatial scales. Overall, we found high prey
   occupancy and tiger habitat use, suggesting the Churia is valuable
   habitat for ungulates and tigers. Given that this habitat accounts for
   639 km(2) within CNP and 7642 km(2) across the entire Terai Arc, the
   Churia should no longer be neglected in global tiger conservation
   planning.},

Title = {Developing a systematic simulation-based approach for selecting
   indicators in strategic cumulative effects assessments with multiple
   environmental valued components},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {61},
Number = {2},
Pages = {512-525},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Indicator selection is a critical step in conducting effective strategic
   cumulative effects assessments. Selecting an appropriate set of
   indicators to represent multiple and sometimes disparate values is
   particularly challenging because the interpretation of impacts depends
   on indicator roles and relationships among indicators. However,
   systematic approaches for selection of indicators for strategic
   cumulative effects assessments (CEA) are unclear. For a 909,000 ha case
   study area involving 214 watersheds in coastal British Columbia, we
   defined a suite of twenty indicators linked to six Valued Components
   (VCs) that could be forecasted for forest, riparian and species at risk
   as three key values consistent with present land-use planning policies
   in British Columbia, Canada. We used spatio-temporal process-based
   models to project and integrate the stressor-response relationships
   between forest harvesting and run-of-river power resource management
   activities and the suite of selected indicators. For a likely
   development scenario, we assessed the correlative structure among
   projected indicator responses and, using a PCA-based analysis of
   outcomes, identified both patterns of potential redundancies and
   ecological processes linking indicators and dominant processes
   influencing VCs. Our results suggest that strategic CEAs will benefit if
   indicator selections are not made independently for each VC. Identifying
   the type of indicator, i.e., pressure or condition, and scale of its
   representation was important in determining if assessed impacts for
   individual indicators could be appropriately integrated to quantify
   overall impacts in the landscape. Consideration of indicator-indicator
   relationships both within and among VCs clarifies the influences of
   spatial scale, potential redundancies among indicators, and the role of
   underlying ecological processes in interpreting and aggregating
   indicator responses. Our case study demonstrates that relative scales of
   ecological processes, disturbances and management actions can limit how
   cohesive the interpretations of impacts may be across VCs in strategic
   CEA. Analysis of correlative structures among the twenty indicators
   suggested criteria-based statistical redundancies occurred between only
   two indicator pairs, however PCA suggested three ecological processes
   (road disturbance, Spotted Owl habitat state, retention and recruitment
   of old forest) were operating to relate behaviors of multiple
   indicators. Careful consideration of the interacting roles of ecological
   processes as they relate to values is required when determining
   appropriate indicators and designing how best to aggregate indicator
   results into an effective strategic CEA. A three step systematic and
   generalizable approach to forecasting present and future states of
   indicators will improve efficiencies and effectiveness of strategic CEA.

Title = {Potential distributions of invasive vertebrates in the Iberian Peninsula
   under projected changes in climate extreme events},

Abstract = {Aim Invasive alien species (IAS) can cause profound impacts on ecosystem
   function and diversity, human health, well-being and livelihoods.
   Climate change is an important driver of biological invasions, so it is
   critical to develop models and climate-driven scenarios of IAS range
   shifts to establish preventive measures. In this study, we analyse how
   projected changes in the frequency and magnitude of climate extreme
   events could affect the spread of the six most widely distributed
   invasive vertebrate species in the Iberian Peninsula. Location Iberian
   Peninsula. Taxa Red avadavat (Amandava amandava), common waxbill
   (Estrilda astrild), monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus), rose-ringed
   parakeet (Psittacula krameri), American mink (Neovison vison) and pond
   slider (Trachemys scripta). Methods We followed best-practice standards
   for species distribution models (SDMs) regarding handling of the
   response and predictor variables, model building and evaluation using
   metrics that assess different facets of model performance. We used an
   ensemble approach with four modelling methods of varying complexity,
   including both regression-based and tree-based machine-learning
   algorithms. We analysed five regional models for current (1971-2000) and
   future climate (2021-2050). We used principal components analysis to
   assess consensus among model outputs and positively weighed predictions
   from well-performing models. Results Selected models showed high
   consensus and good predictive capacity on block cross-validation areas.
   Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models scored highest
   in reliability (calibration), but Bayesian Additive Regression Trees
   provided the best balance between calibration and discrimination
   capacity. Forecasts include visible changes in environmental
   favourability, with losses generally outweighing the gains, but with
   some areas becoming more favourable for several species. Main
   conclusions Increased frequency and/or intensity of climate extreme
   events associated with ongoing climate change are projected to reduce
   overall invasion risk for the species examined although increases in
   favourability should be expected locally.},

Title = {Recent large-scale landscape changes, genetic drift and reintroductions
   characterize the genetic structure of Norwegian wild reindeer},
Journal = {CONSERVATION GENETICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1405-1419},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Landscape changes, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, subdivide
   wild populations, reduce their size, and limit gene flow. These changes
   may further lead to depletion of genetic variation within populations as
   well as accelerating differentiation among populations. As a migratory
   species requiring large living areas, wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)
   is highly vulnerable to human activity. The number and continued
   presence of wild reindeer have been significantly reduced due to
   accelerating anthropogenic habitat modifications, as well as
   displacement in benefit of domesticated herds of the species. As a basis
   for future management strategies we assess genetic structure and levels
   of genetic variation in Norwegian wild reindeer by analysing 12
   microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial control region in 21
   management units with varying population sizes. Overall, both markers
   showed highly varying levels of genetic variation, with reduced
   variation in the smaller and more isolated populations. The
   microsatellite data indicated a relationship between population size and
   genetic variation. This relationship was positive and linear until a
   threshold for population size was reached at approximately 1500
   reindeer. We found high levels of differentiation among most
   populations, indicating low levels of gene flow, but only a weak
   correlation between geographic and genetic distances. Our results imply
   that the genetic structure of Norwegian wild reindeer is mainly driven
   by recent colonization history, population size, as well as
   human-induced landscape fragmentation, restricting gene flow and leading
   to high levels of genetic drift. To sustain viable populations,
   conservation strategies should focus on genetic connectivity between
   populations.},

Title = {Continental threat: How many common carp (Cyprinus carpio) are there in
   Australia?},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {254},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) are one of the world's most destructive
   vertebrate pests. In Australia, they dominate many aquatic ecosystems
   causing a severe threat to aquatic plants, invertebrates, water quality,
   native fish and social amenity. The Australian Government is considering
   release of cyprinid herpesvirus-3 (CyHV-3) as a control measure and
   consequently a robust, continental-scale estimate of the carp population
   and biomass is essential to inform planning and risk management. Here,
   we pioneer a novel model-based approach to provide the first estimate of
   carp density (no/ha) and biomass density (kg/ha) at river
   reach/waterbody, basin and continental scales. We built a spatial layer
   of rivers and waterbodies, classified aquatic habitats and calculated
   the area of each throughout the range of carp in Australia. We then
   developed a database of fishery-independent electrofishing
   catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for habitat types, containing catch
   information for 574,145 carp caught at 4831 sites. Eastern Australia
   accounted for 96\% of carp biomass and 92\% of the total available
   wetted habitat area (16,686 km2) was occupied. To correct these data for
   variable detection efficiencies, we used existing electrofishing data
   and undertook additional field experiments to establish relationships
   between relative and absolute abundances. We then scaled-up site-based
   estimates to habitat types to generate continental estimates. The number
   of carp was estimated at 199.2 M (95\%Crl: 106 M to 357.6 M) for an
   `average' hydrological scenario and 357.5 M (95\%Crl: 178.9 M to 685.1
   M) for a `wet' hydrological scenario. In eastern Australia, these
   numbers correspond with biomasses of 205,774 t (95\%Crl: 117,532-356,482
   t) (average scenario) and 368,357 t (95\%Crl: 184,234-705,630 t) (wet
   scenario). At a continental scale the total biomass was estimated at
   215,456 t for an `average' hydrological scenario. Perennial lowland
   rivers had the highest CPUE and greatest biomass density (up to 826
   kg/ha) and the modelled biomass exceeded a density-impact threshold of
   80-100 kg/ha in 54\% of wetlands and 97\% of stream area in large
   lowland rivers. The continental-scale biomass estimates provide a
   baseline for focusing national conservation strategies to reduce carp
   populations below thresholds needed to restore aquatic ecosystems at a
   range of spatial scales.},

Title = {Habitat disturbance results in chronic stress and impaired health status
   in forest-dwelling paleotropical bats},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat disturbance is a major threat to biodiversity
   worldwide. Yet, before population declines are detectable, individuals
   may suffer from chronic stress and impaired immunity in disturbed
   habitats, making them more susceptible to pathogens and adverse weather
   conditions. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing
   logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the
   body mass and immunity of bats. We measured and compared body mass,
   chronic stress (indicated by neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios) and the
   number of circulating immune cells between several bat species with
   different roost types living in recovering areas, actively logged
   forests, and fragmented forests in Sabah, Malaysia. In a cave-roosting
   species, chronic stress levels were higher in individuals from
   fragmented habitats compared with conspecifics from actively logged
   areas. Foliage-roosting species showed a reduced body mass and decrease
   in total white blood cell counts in actively logged areas and fragmented
   forests compared with conspecifics living in recovering habitats. Our
   study highlights that habitat disturbance may have species-specific
   effects on chronic stress and immunity in bats that are potentially
   related to the roost type. We identified foliage-roosting species as
   particularly sensitive to forest habitat deterioration. These species
   may face a heightened extinction risk in the near future if
   anthropogenic habitat alterations continue.},

Title = {Ex situ versus in situ Eurasian lynx populations: implications for
   successful breeding and genetic rescue},
Journal = {CONSERVATION GENETICS},
Abstract = {The main aim of ex situ programmes in conservation is to provide a
   suitable source of individuals for future reintroductions or
   reinforcement of existing populations. A fundamental prerequisite is
   creating and maintaining healthy and sustainable captive populations
   that show high levels of phenotypic and genetic similarity to their wild
   counterparts. The Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) is a model of a locally
   extinct species that has been subject to long-term captive breeding and
   of past and ongoing reintroduction efforts. To test for genetic
   suitability of ex situ population, a comparative genetic evaluation
   including in situ populations was undertaken. The assignment analysis of
   97 captive lynx from 45 European zoos, wildlife parks and private breeds
   was performed using 124 lynx from different wild Eurasian populations
   belonging to three evolutionary lineages: the Carpathian, the Northern,
   and the Siberian lynx. The results showed a high proportion of Siberian
   lynx (51\%) in the European captive lynx population. Remaining captive
   animals were assigned to either the Carpathian (28\%), or the Northern
   lynx lineage (13\%). Admixture between lineages was rather low (8\%).
   Notably, no or very low difference in genetic diversity was detected
   between the wild and captive lynx populations. Our results support the
   potential of the captive population to provide genetically suitable
   individuals for genetic rescue programmes. The transfer of genes between
   isolated populations, including those in captivity, should become an
   important management tool to preserve genetic variability and prevent
   inbreeding depression in native and reintroduced populations of this
   iconic predator.},

Title = {Comparing community garden typologies of Baltimore, Chicago, and New

Abstract = {Urban community gardens offer unique social and ecological benefits in
   cities. However, given the dynamic nature of cities and the profound
   effects of variable land uses on green space provisioning for people and
   wildlife, investigating community gardens from a landscape perspective
   offers valuable insight into the functions of these spaces in terms of
   ecosystem services and sustainable development. In this study, we use
   garden locations provided by stakeholder groups and fine-scale spatial
   data to compare community gardens across three cities: New York City,
   NY, Chicago, IL, and Baltimore, MD (USA). In each city, we assess the
   spatial distribution of gardens and compare the natural vegetation and
   impervious surface cover within these gardens to the surrounding
   neighborhood and landscape. We then compared these cities to clarify the
   role of community gardens in metropolitan development. Our findings
   demonstrate that gardens cluster in neighborhoods in New York City and
   Chicago, but they are more spatially distributed across the landscape in
   Baltimore. The distribution of Baltimore's community gardens is more
   likely to be contributing to a greater network of ecosystem services
   across a broader urban landscape. Moreover, at the garden scale, gardens
   in NYC and Chicago have more canopy cover and built infrastructure than
   the more herbaceous gardens in Baltimore. This suggests that our case
   study cities exhibit different garden typologies, histories, and
   potential for ecosystem services. This work provides critical insight
   into the typology in and around community gardens in different cities,
   which is useful in understanding the potential ecosystem services and
   planning trajectories of these cities.},

Title = {Context-dependent variability in the predicted daily energetic costs of
   disturbance for blue whales},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Assessing the long-term consequences of sub-lethal anthropogenic
   disturbance on wildlife populations requires integrating data on
   fine-scale individual behavior and physiology into spatially and
   temporally broader, population-level inference. A typical behavioral
   response to disturbance is the cessation of foraging, which can be
   translated into a common metric of energetic cost. However, this
   necessitates detailed empirical information on baseline movements,
   activity budgets, feeding rates and energy intake, as well as the
   probability of an individual responding to the disturbance-inducing
   stressor within different exposure contexts. Here, we integrated data
   from blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) experimentally exposed to
   military active sonar signals with fine-scale measurements of baseline
   behavior over multiple days or weeks obtained from accelerometry
   loggers, telemetry tracking and prey sampling. Specifically, we
   developed daily simulations of movement, feeding behavior and exposure
   to localized sonar events of increasing duration and intensity and
   predicted the effects of this disturbance source on the daily energy
   intake of an individual. Activity budgets and movements were highly
   variable in space and time and among individuals, resulting in large
   variability in predicted energetic intake and costs. In half of our
   simulations, an individual's energy intake was unaffected by the
   simulated source. However, some individuals lost their entire daily
   energy intake under brief or weak exposure scenarios. Given this large
   variation, population-level models will have to assess the consequences
   of the entire distribution of energetic costs, rather than only consider
   single summary statistics. The shape of the exposure-response functions
   also strongly influenced predictions, reinforcing the need for
   contextually explicit experiments and improved mechanistic understanding
   of the processes driving behavioral and physiological responses to
   disturbance. This study presents a robust approach for integrating
   different types of empirical information to assess the effects of
   disturbance at spatio-temporal and ecological scales that are relevant
   to management and conservation.},

Title = {Ice matters: Life-history strategies of two Antarctic seals dictate

Abstract = {The impacts of climate change in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are
   not uniform and ice-obligate species with dissimilar life-history
   characteristics will likely respond differently to their changing
   ecosystems. We use a unique data set of Weddell Leptonychotes weddellii
   and crabeater seals' (CESs) Lobodon carcinophaga breeding season
   distribution in the Weddell Sea, determined from satellite imagery. We
   contrast the theoretical climate impacts on both ice-obligate predators
   who differ in life-history characteristics: CESs are highly specialized
   Antarctic krill Euphausia superba predators and breed in the seasonal
   pack ice; Weddell seals (WESs) are generalist predators and breed on
   comparatively stable fast ice. We used presence-absence data and a suite
   of remotely sensed environmental variables to build habitat models. Each
   of the environmental predictors is multiplied by a `climate change
   score' based on known responses to climate change to create a `change
   importance product'. Results show CESs are more sensitive to climate
   change than WESs. Crabeater seals prefer to breed close to krill, and
   the compounding effects of changing sea ice concentrations and sea
   surface temperatures, the proximity to krill and abundance of stable
   breeding ice, can influence their post-breeding foraging success and
   ultimately their future breeding success. But in contrast to the Ross
   Sea, here WESs prefer to breed closer to larger colonies of emperor
   penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri). This suggests that the Weddell Sea may
   currently be prey-abundant, allowing the only two air-breathing
   Antarctic silverfish predators (Pleuragramma antarctica) (WESs and
   emperor penguins) to breed closer to each other. This is the first
   basin-scale, region-specific comparison of breeding season habitat in
   these two key Antarctic predators based on real-world data to compare
   climate change responses. This work shows that broad-brush, basin-scale
   approaches to understanding species-specific responses to climate change
   are not always appropriate, and regional models are needed-especially
   when designing marine protected areas.},

Abstract = {Species are frequently responding to contemporary climate change by
   shifting to higher elevations and poleward to track suitable climate
   space. However, depending on local conditions and species' sensitivity,
   the nature of these shifts can be highly variable and difficult to
   predict. Here, we examine how the American pika (Ochotona princeps), a
   philopatric, montane lagomorph, responds to climatic gradients at three
   spatial scales. Using mixed-effects modeling in an information-theoretic
   approach, we evaluated a priori model suites regarding predictors of
   site occupancy, relative abundance, and elevational-range retraction
   across 760 talus patches, nested within 64 watersheds across the
   Northern Rocky Mountains of North America, during 2017-2020. The top
   environmental predictors differed across these response metrics. Warmer
   temperatures in summer and winter were associated with lower occupancy,
   lower relative abundances, and greater elevational retraction across
   watersheds. Occupancy was also strongly influenced by habitat patch
   size, but only when combined with climate metrics such as actual
   evapotranspiration. Using a second analytical approach, acute heat
   stress and summer precipitation best explained retraction residuals
   (i.e., the relative extent of retraction given the original elevational
   range of occupancy). Despite the study domain occurring near the
   species' geographic-range center, where populations might have higher
   abundances and be at lower risk of climate-related stress, 33.9\% of
   patches showed evidence of recent extirpations. Pika-extirpated sites
   averaged 1.44celcius warmer in summer than did occupied sites.
   Additionally, the minimum elevation of pika occupancy has retracted
   upslope in 69\% of watersheds (mean: 281 m). Our results emphasize the
   nuance associated with evaluating species' range dynamics in response to
   climate gradients, variability, and temperature exceedances, especially
   in regions where species occupy gradients of conditions that may
   constitute multiple range edges. Furthermore, this study highlights the
   importance of evaluating diverse drivers across response metrics to
   improve the predictive accuracy of widely used, correlative models.},

Abstract = {Adequate levels of genetic diversity are important for long term
   persistence of wildlife species, yet genetic principles have only been
   considered in the last few years when developing management plans for
   conservation purposes. We present here an example on how genetic
   management plans can be explicitly integrated into an adaptive
   management framework. This can be achieved by developing a predictive
   model to explore population responses to different management options,
   and by quantifying management targets that should be verified through
   monitoring programs. We apply this approach to the woylie or brush
   tailed bettong (Bettongia penicillata); an Australian macropod, listed
   as Critically Endangered. Results suggest that discrete small
   populations (e.g. < 1000-3000 individuals) will require active
   management. Ongoing supplementation programs were the most promising
   management option. However, the translocation of a 1-4/year woylies
   would not improve the genetic profile of relatively small populations (<
   1000 individuals). Overall, for supplementations to have a significant
   impact on genetic diversity, translocating > 30 woylies/year over the
   course of several years is recommended. Formal completion of the
   adaptive management approach would include, in addition to the stages
   presented here, a quantitative assessment of the outcome of management
   and continue refinement of the modelling framework on the basis of new
   data gained through ongoing monitoring. We encourage the formal
   inclusion of genetic management within the adaptive management framework
   as demonstrated in this study.},

Abstract = {Risk perceptions and attitudes toward animals often explain tolerance
   for wildlife and management preferences. However, little is understood
   about how these relationships vary across different geographic regions
   and stakeholder groups. To address this gap in knowledge, we compared
   differences in acceptance capacity, risk perceptions, perceived
   enjoyment from outdoor cats, and experiences with outdoor cats among 3
   groups (general public, conservation community, and animal-welfare
   community) in Hawaii and Florida, two states with large conservation
   challenges. We combined independently collected data from Florida and
   Hawaii, to determine how perception of the risks presented by outdoor
   cats, group membership, and state of residence influenced people's
   tolerance for outdoor cats. Florida respondents were significantly more
   tolerant of outdoor cats and less concerned about cat-related risks than
   Hawaii respondents (p < 0.05). In both states, animal-welfare group
   members reported greater enjoyment seeing cats and perceived a smaller
   increase in the cat population and lower levels of risk than other
   groups (p < 0.05). All groups exhibited similar relationships between
   acceptance capacity and enjoyment and the perceived increase in the cat
   population. Our results suggest public tolerance for cats varied due to
   the influence of local or geographical concerns, but that strongly held
   beliefs, risk perceptions, and feelings about cats explained more of the
   variance in stakeholder tolerance.},

Title = {Within-sample variation in snowshoe hare faecal glucocorticoid
   metabolite measurements},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {Faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations are used
   increasingly as a non-invasive measure to index physiological stress
   experienced by diverse taxa. However, FGM may not be evenly distributed
   throughout a faecal mass or faecal pellet group. Moreover, within-sample
   variation in FGM measurements associated with different sampling and/or
   processing techniques is rarely reported despite potentially having
   important implications for inferring stress levels in free-ranging
   wildlife. Using a captive collection of snowshoe hares (Lepus
   americanus), we (i) assessed repeatability of FGM measurements (i.e.
   precision) from two processing techniques (measurements derived from
   dividing whole pellet groups into equal proportions prior to processing
   {[}G1], measurements from subsamples derived from thoroughly homogenized
   whole pellet groups {[}G2]) and (ii) conducted a power analysis to
   estimate sample-size requirements for detecting statistically
   significant differences in FGM concentrations at a population level. Our
   results indicate that the mean percent coefficient of variation (\% CV)
   for within-sample FGM variation was slightly higher for G1 (\% CV = 35,
   range 13.45-65.37) than for G2 (\% CV = 23, range 7.26-47.94), though
   not statistically significant (two sample t-test, n = 8, t = 1.57, P =
   0.16). Thus, FGM is relatively evenly distributed within snowshoe hare
   faecal pellet groups. However, subsampling from homogenized whole pellet
   groups may be more appropriate when the sampling time frame is less
   controlled (e.g. multiple defecation events) because a subsample derived
   from a homogenized whole pellet group might be more representative of
   the animal's `average' physiological state compared to FGM
   concentrations derived from a few haphazardly selected faecal pellets.
   Power analysis results demonstrated the importance of a priori
   consideration of sample sizes. Relatively small effect sizes (e.g. <
   20\%) may require sampling that is logistically and/or cost prohibitive.
   Yet for many situations of ecological or conservation interest,
   treatment effects may be substantial (> 25\%) and thus moderate sample
   sizes may be sufficient for testing research hypotheses regarding
   changes FGM concentrations.},

Abstract = {There is growing evidence that changes in deep-sea benthic ecosystems
   are modulated by climate changes, but most evidence to date comes from
   the North Atlantic Ocean. Here we analyze new ostracod and published
   foraminiferal records for the last 250,000 years on Shatsky Rise in the
   North Pacific Ocean. Using linear models, we evaluate statistically the
   ability of environmental drivers (temperature, productivity, and
   seasonality of productivity) to predict changes in faunal diversity,
   abundance, and composition. These microfossil data show
   glacial-interglacial shifts in overall abundances and species
   diversities that are low during glacial intervals and high during
   interglacials. These patterns replicate those previously documented in
   the North Atlantic Ocean, suggesting that the climatic forcing of the
   deep-sea ecosystem is widespread, and possibly global in nature.
   However, these results also reveal differences with prior studies that
   probably reflect the isolated nature of Shatsky Rise as a remote oceanic
   plateau. Ostracod assemblages on Shatsky Rise are highly endemic but of
   low diversity, consistent with the limited dispersal potential of these
   animals. Benthic foraminifera, by contrast, have much greater dispersal
   ability and their assemblages at Shatsky Rise show diversities typical
   for deep-sea faunas in other regions.
   Statistical analyses also reveal ostracod-foraminferal differences in
   relationships between environmental drivers and biotic change. Rarefied
   diversity is best explained as a hump-shaped function of surface
   productivity in ostracods, but as having a weak and positive
   relationship with temperature in foraminifera. Abundance shows a
   positive relationship with both productivity and seasonality of
   productivity in foraminifera, and a hump-shaped relationship with
   productivity in ostracods. Finally, species composition in ostracods is
   influenced by both temperature and productivity, but only a temperature
   effect is evident in foraminifera. Though complex in detail, the
   global-scale link between deep-sea ecosystems and Quaternary climate
   changes underscores the importance of the interaction between the
   physical and biological components of paleoceanographical research for
   better understanding the history of the biosphere.},

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2029-2046},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Chikanda is a traditional dish made with wild-harvested ground orchid
   tubers belonging to three orchidioid genera, Disa, Satyrium and
   Habenaria, all of which are CITES appendix II-listed. Identification of
   collected orchid tubers is very difficult and documentation of
   constituent species in prepared chikanda has hitherto been impossible.
   Here amplicon metabarcoding was used in samples of six prepared chikanda
   cakes to study genetic sequence diversity and species diversity in this
   product. Molecular operational taxonomic unit identification using
   similarity-matching reveals that species of all three genera were
   present in the chikanda samples studied. Disa was present in all of the
   samples, Satyrium in five out of six and Habenaria in one of the
   samples, as well as a number of other plants. The fact that each sample
   contained orchids and the presence of a wide variety of species from all
   genera in this traditional dish raise serious concerns about the
   sustainability of this trade and the future of wild orchid populations
   in the main harvest areas. This proof-of-concept study shows that
   Ion-Torrent PGM is a cost-effective scalable platform for metabarcoding
   using the relatively long nrITS1 and nrITS2 regions. Furthermore, nrITS
   metabarcoding can be successfully used for the detection of specific
   ingredients in a highly-processed food product at genus level, and this
   makes it a useful tool in the detection of possible conservation issues
   arising from commercialized trade or processed plant products.},

Title = {COVID-19 pandemic impacts on conservation research, management, and
   public engagement in US national parks},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {257},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the timing and substance of
   conservation research, management, and public engagement in protected
   areas around the world. This disruption is evident in US national parks,
   which play a key role in protecting natural and cultural resources and
   providing outdoor experiences for the public. Collectively, US national
   parks protect 34 million ha, host more than 300 million visits annually,
   and serve as one of the world's largest informal education
   organizations. The pandemic has altered park conditions and operations
   in a variety of ways. Shifts in operational conditions related to safety
   issues, reduced staffing, and decreased park revenues have forced
   managers to make difficult trade-offs among competing priorities.
   Long-term research and monitoring of the health of ecosystems and
   wildlife populations have been interrupted. Time-sensitive management
   practices, such as control of invasive plants and restoration of
   degraded habitat, have been delayed. And public engagement has largely
   shifted from in-person experiences to virtual engagement through social
   media and other online interactions. These changes pose challenges for
   accomplishing important science, management, and public engagement
   goals, but they also create opportunities for developing more flexible
   monitoring programs and inclusive methods of public engagement. The
   COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the need for strategic science, management
   planning, flexible operations, and online public engagement to help
   managers address rapid and unpredictable challenges.},

Title = {Implications of African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) denning on the density

Abstract = {African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) are often the least popular large
   carnivore among game ranchers because of their perceived impact on prey
   populations. Landowner perceptions include that wild dogs greatly
   deplete prey during their three-month denning period, take prey that
   could otherwise be sold for hunting and cause prey to move away from the
   vicinity of their den sites. Landowners' tolerance towards African wild
   dogs could thus be improved with a more rigorous understanding of the
   actual impact of wild dogs on prey populations during the denning
   period. Using impala density data and wild dog denning records from
   Sango Ranch in the Sav, Valley Conservancy, Zimbabwe, we compared impala
   densities between pre-denning, denning and post-denning season and
   between inside and outside the denning home range. Our results indicate
   that wild dog denning does not cause a significant local reduction in
   prey around the den and does not cause prey to move away from denning
   areas. However prey species did occur in lower density inside the
   denning home ranges than outside, in all seasons. This result indicates
   that wild dogs select dens in areas of lower prey density, perhaps as an
   avoidance mechanism for lions. Accordingly, contrary to what landowners
   believe, wild dogs do not have a significant impact on prey populations
   during their denning season.},

Abstract = {Hedgerow plant communities, including herbaceous species growing in the
   hedge base, are important conservation indicators of hedgerow habitat
   condition. The effects of management have the potential to alter the
   species richness and composition of hedgerow plant communities, but this
   has not previously been tested experimentally. A novel field experiment
   was used to test the effects of hedgerow management on hedgerow basal
   flora. Hedgerow cutting treatments, including relaxed cutting regimes
   funded under agri-environment schemes, were applied in replicated blocks
   at four sites in lowland UK. After 6 years of experimental cutting
   treatments the hedgerow plant communities were surveyed, both directly
   under the woody hedgerow vegetation and immediately adjacent to the
   hedges. For hedgerow plots cut in autumn, a reduced intensity cutting
   regime (incremental cutting) resulted in an average reduction of one
   species and a small shift towards plants typical of less fertile
   conditions, compared to cutting back to a standard height and width.
   Hedgerow plots cut in late winter had a plant community typical of
   slightly shadier conditions, compared with those cut in autumn. Hedgerow
   cutting management can thus alter the richness and composition of plant
   communities, over relatively short timescales. These results are
   discussed in the context of longer term trends in hedgerow plant
   communities across northern Europe, and conservation management funded
   under agri-environment schemes.},

   and-gorillas in a forestry concession in northern Republic of Congo. We
   used generalized linear models to relate ape nest counts to a set of
   predictor variables, representing the impact of logging and controlled
   for variation in environmental conditions including food availability,
   habitat and rainfall. Commercial forest inventory data were used to
   assess the baseline influence of food availability and forest structure
   on ape distribution. Higher numbers of chimpanzees were found in
   proximity to their preferred tree foods, whereas gorillas were
   associated with more heterogeneous habitats. Chimpanzee nest encounter
   rates decreased with increasing intensity of human impacts. Gorillas
   also avoided areas with active timber exploitation and roads, but were
   attracted to recently logged areas with abundant terrestrial herbaceous
   vegetation. Species-specific responses were consistent with theoretical
   predictions of niche partitioning and cumulative human influence. Based
   on these findings, we provide recommendations to improve existing
   guidelines and forest certification standards aimed at safeguarding ape
   populations.},

Title = {A framework for understanding semi-permeable barrier effects on
   migratory ungulates},

Abstract = {Impermeable barriers to migration can greatly constrain the set of
   possible routes and ranges used by migrating animals. For ungulates,
   however, many forms of development are semi-permeable, and making
   informed management decisions about their potential impacts to the
   persistence of migration routes is difficult because our knowledge of
   how semi-permeable barriers affect migratory behaviour and function is
   limited. Here, we propose a general framework to advance the
   understanding of barrier effects on ungulate migration by emphasizing
   the need to (i) quantify potential barriers in terms that allow
   behavioural thresholds to be considered, (ii) identify and measure
   behavioural responses to semi-permeable barriers and (iii) consider the
   functional attributes of the migratory landscape (e.g. stopovers) and
   how the benefits of migration might be reduced by behavioural changes.
   We used global position system (GPS) data collected from two
   subpopulations of mule deer Odocoileus hemionus to evaluate how
   different levels of gas development influenced migratory behaviour,
   including movement rates and stopover use at the individual level, and
   intensity of use and width of migration route at the population level.
   We then characterized the functional landscape of migration routes as
   either stopover habitat or movement corridors and examined how the
   observed behavioural changes affected the functionality of the migration
   route in terms of stopover use. We found migratory behaviour to vary
   with development intensity. Our results suggest that mule deer can
   migrate through moderate levels of development without any noticeable
   effects on migratory behaviour. However, in areas with more intensive
   development, animals often detoured from established routes, increased
   their rate of movement and reduced stopover use, while the overall use
   and width of migration routes decreased. Synthesis and applications. In
   contrast to impermeable barriers that impede animal movement,
   semi-permeable barriers allow animals to maintain connectivity between
   their seasonal ranges. Our results identify the mechanisms (e.g.
   detouring, increased movement rates, reduced stopover use) by which
   semi-permeable barriers affect the functionality of ungulate migration
   routes and emphasize that the management of semi-permeable barriers may
   play a key role in the conservation of migratory ungulate populations.},

Title = {Auditory impairment from acoustic seal deterrents predicted for harbour
   porpoises in a marine protected area},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1631-1642},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1. Management interventions to reduce human-wildlife conflict can have
   unintended consequences for non-target species. Acoustic deterrent
   devices (ADDs) are used globally by the aquaculture sector. However, the
   potential for these sound emissions to impact non-target species, such
   as cetaceans, has not yet been quantified at population relevant spatial
   scales.
   2. To better understand the extent of potential impacts on cetaceans,
   such as harbour porpoises, we used acoustic modelling to investigate
   levels of ADD noise throughout the west coast of Scotland and across a
   Special Area of Conservation (SAC) for this species.
   3. Using an energy-flux acoustic propagation model and data on
   aquaculture sites known to be using ADDs, we predicted the spatial
   extent of ADD noise on the Scottish west coast from 1 February 2017 to
   31 January 2018. Noise maps were produced to determine the risk of
   auditory impairment for harbour porpoises under a range of scenarios
   which assumed single or multiple ADDs and simultaneous use across all
   sites.
   4. The acoustic propagation model performed well when tested against
   field measurements up to 5 km, with 98\% of sound exposure level (SEL)
   predictions within +/- 10\% of the measurements. Predictions of SELs
   over a 24-hr period suggested extensive temporary hearing loss zones
   (median radius: similar to 28 km) for harbour porpoises around
   aquaculture sites. Assuming a single device at each site, 23\% of the
   harbour porpoise SAC was predicted to be exposed to ADD noise sufficient
   to induce a temporary threshold shift, and under the worst-case scenario
   (multiple, continuously running devices per site with an aggregate duty
   cycle of 100\%), levels exceeding permanent threshold shift could reach
   0.9\% of the SAC.
   5. Policy implications. This study highlights the potential for
   `collateral damage' from interventions such as acoustic deterrent
   devices (ADDs) which are intended to reduce human-wildlife conflicts
   with pinnipeds but may affect the long-term health and habitat use of
   non-target species. This is especially true for harbour porpoises which
   are protected under the EU and UK Habitats Regulations. The aquaculture
   industry, policymakers and regulators in countries where ADDs are used
   should consider these findings when attempting to mitigate pinniped
   depredation.},

Title = {Declines in migrant shorebird populations from a winter-quarter
   perspective},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {877-887},

Abstract = {Many long-distance migrating shorebird (i.e., sandpipers, plovers,
   flamingos, oystercatchers) populations are declining. Although regular
   shorebird monitoring programs exist worldwide, most estimates of
   shorebird population trends and sizes are poor or nonexistent. We built
   a state-space model to estimate shorebird population trends. Compared
   with more commonly used methods of trend estimation, state-space models
   are more mechanistic, allow for the separation of observation and state
   process, and can easily accommodate multivariate time series and
   nonlinear trends. We fitted the model to count data collected from 1990
   to 2013 on 18 common shorebirds at the 2 largest coastal wetlands in
   southern Africa, Sandwich Harbour (a relatively pristine bay) and Walvis
   Bay (an international harbor), Namibia. Four of the 12 long-distance
   migrant species declined since 1990: Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria
   interpres), Little Stint (Calidris minuta), Common Ringed Plover
   (Charadrius hiaticula), and Red Knot (Calidris canutus). Populations of
   resident species and short-distance migrants increased or were stable.
   Similar patterns at a key South African wetland suggest that shorebird
   populations migrating to southern Africa are declining in line with the
   global decline, but local conditions in southern Africa's largest
   wetlands are not contributing to these declines. State-space models
   provide estimates of population levels and trends and could be used
   widely to improve the current state of water bird estimates.
   Declinaciones en las Poblaciones de Aves Costeras Migrantes a partir de
   una Perspectiva de Residencias Invernales Muchas poblaciones de aves de
   costa que migran grandes distancias (p. ej.: zarapitos, chorlitos,
   flamencos, ostreros) estan declinando. Aunque existen programas
   regulares de monitoreo de estas aves a nivel mundial, la mayoria de las
   estimaciones de sus tendencias y tamanos poblacionales son pobres o no
   existen. Construimos un modelo de estado-espacio para estimar las
   tendencias poblacionales de estas aves. Al compararlos con los metodos
   de estimacion de tendencias usados mas comunmente, los modelos de
   estado-espacio son mas mecanicos, permiten la separacion del proceso de
   observacion y de estado, y pueden acomodar facilmente series de tiempo
   multi-variadas y tendencias no-lineales. Ajustamos el modelo para que
   contara datos colectados de 1990 a 2013 sobre 18 aves de costa, comunes
   en dos de los humedales mas grandes del sur de africa: Puerto Sandwich
   (una bahia relativamente pristina) y Bahia Walvis (un puerto
   internacional), Namibia. Cuatro de las 12 especies que migran grandes
   distancias declinaron significativamente desde 1990: Arenaria interpres,
   Calidris minuta, Charadrius hiaticula y Calidris canutus. Las
   poblaciones de las especies residentes o que migran distancias cortas
   incrementaron o se mantuvieron estables. Los patrones similares en un
   humedal importante de Sudafrica sugieren que las poblaciones de aves de
   costa que migran al sur de africa estan declinando a la par con la
   declinacion global, pero que las condiciones locales en los humedales
   mas grandes del sur del continente no estan contribuyendo a estas
   declinaciones. Los modelos de estado-espacio proporcionan estimados de
   los niveles y las tendencias poblacionales y podrian usarse ampliamente
   para mejorar el estado actual de las estimaciones de las aves acuaticas.

Title = {Stress response to handling is short lived but may reflect personalities
   in a wild, Critically Endangered tortoise species},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {We investigated the acute stress response associated with animal
   personalities by measuring plasma glucocorticoids throughout handling
   and collected similar to 2 years of movement and behavioural data in a
   wild, Critically Endangered animal, Astrochelys radiata (radiated
   tortoise). To determine whether our standard, brief conscientious
   handling procedures induce a stress response in our target species, we
   applied a stressor by way of initial animal processing and deployment of
   telemetry equipment. During surveys and processing, we sampled animals
   immediately upon detection, again after completing transmitter
   attachment and processing, and a final time the following day. We then
   used radiotelemetry to follow a subset of the animals for 22 months
   while collecting behavioural, climatic and location data. We found that
   brief and conscientious handling did not illicit consistent changes in
   plasma concentrations of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) but
   did reveal tremendous individual variation in response. The CORT
   concentration ranged more than 200-fold after imposing the stressor and
   returned to near-baseline values by the following day. When we accounted
   for the wide variation by calculating the degree of each individual's
   stress response relative to its baseline over its processing time, we
   discovered two non-overlapping physiological response types; those in
   which CORT concentrations increased dramatically in response to handling
   (219 +/- 89.8 pg/ml/min) and those in which CORT varied only slightly
   (5.3 +/- 8.9 pg/ml/min). The response types (strong vs. mild) also
   predicted body condition, home range size, activity, and behavioural
   tendencies. The degree of the individual's stress response in this
   species may be one component of correlated physiological and behavioural
   traits (animal personalities), which have previously been obscured in
   other chelonian studies by the use of mean values and should be
   considered in future conservation management applications for chelonian
   species.},

Title = {Is the Yelkouan shearwater Puffinus yelkouan threatened by low adult
   survival probabilities?},

Abstract = {Many seabird species are experiencing population declines, with key
   factors being high adult mortality caused by fishery by-catch and
   predation by introduced predators on nesting islands. In the
   Mediterranean, both of these pressures are intensive and widespread. We
   studied the adult survival of an endemic Mediterranean seabird, the
   Yelkouan shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan), between 1969-1994 and 2007-2010
   in Malta and between 2004-2010 in France using mark-recapture methods.
   Mean annual survival probabilities for breeding adults were below 0.9
   for all colonies and periods. Between 1969-1994, annual survival for
   adults of unknown breeding status was on average 0.74 (95\% confidence
   interval: 0.69-0.80) in Malta, possibly as a result of various human
   disturbances (including illegal shooting), light pollution and fisheries
   by-catch. Over the period 2004-2010, we found strong support for
   variation in adult survival probabilities between breeders and
   non-breeders, and islands with and without introduced predators in
   France. Survival probabilities for non-breeders (0.95, 0.81-1.0)
   appeared to be higher than for breeders (0.82, 0.70-0.94), but were
   imprecise partly due to low recapture probabilities. In Malta, we found
   evidence for heterogeneity in survival probabilities between two unknown
   groups (probably breeders and non-breeders), and seasonal variation in
   survival probability. Birds were more likely to survive the period
   including the peak breeding season than an equally long period during
   which they roam widely at sea. Although annual adult survival
   probability was still low (0.85, 0.58-1.0), colony protection measures
   appear to have reduced mortality at nesting cliffs. A population model
   indicated that colonies in France and Malta would currently require
   continuous immigration of 5-12 pairs per year to maintain stable
   populations. Our estimates of adult survival probabilities over the past
   four decades are consistent with overall population declines. Threats to
   Yelkouan shearwaters require immediate management actions to avoid
   ongoing population declines in the western Mediterranean. (C) 2011

Title = {Comparative genomics of cetartiodactyla: energy metabolism underpins the
   transition to an aquatic lifestyle},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Foraging disruption caused by human activities is emerging as a key
   issue in cetacean conservation because it can affect nutrient levels and
   the amount of energy available to individuals to invest into
   reproduction. Our ability to predict how anthropogenic stressors affect
   these ecological processes and ultimately population trajectory depends
   crucially on our understanding of the complex physiological mechanisms
   that detect nutrient availability and regulate energy metabolism,
   foraging behavior and life-history decisions. These physiological
   mechanisms are likely to differ considerably from terrestrial mammalian
   model systems. Here, we examine nucleotide substitution rates in
   cetacean and other artiodactyl genomes to identify signatures of
   selection in genes associated with nutrient sensing pathways. We also
   estimated the likely physiological consequences of adaptive amino acid
   substitutions for pathway functions. Our results highlight that genes
   involved in the insulin, mTOR and NF-kB pathways are subject to
   significant positive selection in cetaceans compared to terrestrial
   artiodactyla. These genes may have been positively selected to enable
   cetaceans to adapt to a glucose-poor diet, to overcome deleterious
   effects caused by hypoxia during diving (e.g. oxidative stress and
   inflammation) and to modify fat-depot signaling functions in a manner
   different to terrestrial mammals. We thus show that adaptation in
   cetaceans to an aquatic lifestyle significantly affected functions in
   nutrient sensing pathways. The use of fat stores as a condition index in
   cetaceans may be confounded by the multiple and critical roles fat has
   in regulating cetacean metabolism, foraging behavior and diving
   physiology.},

Title = {Attract and reward: combining chemical ecology and habitat manipulation
   to enhance biological control in field crops},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {580-590},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {P>1. An increase in pesticide resistance in many pest species is
   promoting interest in biological control. Much remains to be learned
   about natural enemy immigration into and persistence within crops at
   specific times and how to maximize suppression of pest populations.
   Therefore this study was conducted to test a novel biological control
   approach, `attract and reward' which combines two aspects of applied
   insect ecology: synthetic herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to
   improve immigration of beneficial taxa into crops and nectar plants to
   maintain their populations.
   2. The `attract and reward' approach was tested in sweetcorn, broccoli
   and wine-grapes with several HIPV formulations at 1 center dot 0\% (v/v)
   as attractants and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) as reward.
   Abundance of insects was assessed with non-attractive sticky traps for
   up to 22 days after the HIPV spray application.
   3. In sweetcorn, Eulophidae were more numerous in the attract
   treatments: methyl anthranilate, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), methyl
   salicylate (MeSA) and HIPV mix. Encyrtidae were more abundant near
   MeJA-treated plants. In broccoli, Scelionidae were more abundant in MeSA
   treatments with reward and near cis-3-hexenyl acetate-treated plants
   without reward whilst Ceraphronidae were more numerous near MeSA and
   predators were more abundant near HIPV mix-treated plants. Nectar plant
   reward increased catches of parasitoids from several families in all
   three tested crop species and increased predators in sweet corn and
   broccoli.
   4. Increases in natural enemy numbers were correlated with effects at
   the first and second trophic levels. Significantly fewer larvae of the
   sweetcorn pest Helicoverpa spp. were found on sweetcorn plants from
   plots with reward and significantly less Helicoverpa spp. damage was
   evident to cobs for one of the HIPV treatments.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Results suggest that applications of
   synthetic HIPVs can enhance recruitment of natural enemies and buckwheat
   was a suitable resource subsidy plant for increasing abundance and
   residency. Whilst both of these approaches offer potential to enhance
   biological control, further work is required to realize fully
   synergistic effects from their combination as an `attract and reward'
   approach.},

Title = {Combining data from consumers and traditional medicine practitioners to
   provide a more complete picture of Chinese bear bile markets},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1064-1077},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1. Understanding wildlife consumption is essential for the design and
   evaluation of effective conservation interventions to reduce illegal
   trade. This requires understanding both the consumers themselves and
   those who influence their behaviour. For example, in markets for
   wildlife-based medicines, both consumers and medical practitioners have
   a role in which products are consumed.
   2. We used mixed methods to triangulate data on bear bile consumption
   from 3,646 members of the public, 80 pharmacy workers and 38 Traditional
   Chinese Medicine (TCM) doctors in four provincial capital cities across
   China. Bear bile can be sold legally in packaged TCM products made from
   farmed bile, or sold illegally, often as raw gallbladders from wild
   bears. We interviewed medical practitioners, and surveyed the public
   using both direct questions (DQ) and the Unmatched Count Technique
   (UCT), an indirect method used to improve reporting of sensitive
   behaviours. We applied a `combined' UCT-DQ analysis to produce a more
   robust consumption estimate.
   3. In all, 140 (3.8\%) survey respondents directly reported recent (<3
   years) bile consumption, but the combined UCT-DQ estimate was 11.2\%. In
   total, 14 survey respondents (0.4\% sample and 10\% recent consumers)
   self-reported recent wild bile consumption. Almost a quarter of doctors
   and half of pharmacy workers had ever prescribed bile.
   4. Around half of doctors and over a quarter of pharmacy workers said
   that bear bile was the best medicine in certain situations. More than
   half of doctors and over a third of pharmacy workers thought wild bile
   was more effective than farmed, although we found no evidence of wild
   bile being formally prescribed. Consumers could name specific treatment
   uses of bile but almost half of recent consumers did not know the source
   of bile they had consumed.
   5. We show that gathering perspectives from different wildlife market
   actors can generate a more complete picture of trade. In China, bile
   consumption may be limited by its specific TCM treatment uses, but
   whether practitioner views on the greater effectiveness of wild bile are
   passed to consumers must be investigated further. With potential overlap
   between farmed and wild consumption, any interventions to change these
   markets must carefully consider how both consumers and practitioners may
   react.},

Abstract = {On the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, Diphysa americana is one of the
   first species to colonize coastal dunes and it is very common to find
   this species as isolated trees in abandoned sites that were deforested
   for agricultural purposes. Different species of frugivorous birds perch
   in these trees, dropping fruit and seeds in their shade. This species,
   constantly exposed to intense winds from the north, favors and has a
   selective effect on the establishment of species from the seasonal dry
   forest beneath its canopy. In this study we evaluated the direction of
   prevailing wind and its relationship to canopy shape (thigmotropism). We
   also evaluated differences in the abundance and richness of the plants
   that establish in the shade of D. americana by comparing trees exposed
   and not exposed (control) to the prevailing winds. The results indicate
   that the prevailing winds come from the north and that D. americana is
   sensitive to both wind strength and direction (F(3)=13.43, P<0.001). Its
   canopy stretches towards the south, where we find greater plant cover
   (F(3)=29.61 P<0.001) and a different species composition compared with
   the cover to the north. Canopy asymmetry results in differences in the
   abundance and composition of the species below, and this may have
   consequences to the process of succession. D. americana trees contribute
   to the regeneration and conservation of seasonal forest on the coast of
   central Veracruz, Mexico.},

Abstract = {Meat production creates high greenhouse gas emissions while consumption
   of wild game meat presumably has lower greenhouse gas impacts. We
   estimated the amount of meat legally harvested in the United States for
   animals with state or federal harvest data and determined caloric value
   and the greenhouse gas impact (emissions savings) of these harvests.
   Hunting of reported game accounts for approximately 487 billion Kcal,
   about 3\% of U.S. annual meat consumption, although the total is
   probably higher if non-reported (small game) are included. Wild game
   consumption may equal more than two billion kg of avoided
   CO(2)emissions, equivalent to more than \$120 million USD in annual
   carbon avoidance societal benefits. Our results suggest that wild game
   harvests contribute a relatively small, but not irrelevant, greenhouse
   gas savings. Wildlife conservation organizations could use the positive
   climate attributes of wild game harvesting as a public relations tool to
   encourage hunting and subsequent emissions reductions.},

Title = {Does artificial feeding affect large carnivore behaviours? The case
   study of brown bears in a hunted and tourist exploited subpopulation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {254},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Artificial food supplementation of wildlife is an increasing practice
   for species conservation, as well as for hunting and viewing tourism.
   Yet, our understanding of the implications of wildlife supplementary
   feeding is still very limited. Concerns have been raised over the
   potential negative impact of artificial feeding, but the effects of this
   practice on animal movements and rhythms of activity are just beginning
   to be investigated. Here, with the aim of studying whether the
   artificial feeding of brown bears may affect their behaviour, we
   analysed (1) the probability and intensity of feeding site use at
   different temporal scales, (2) how the use of artificial feeding sites
   is related to the bear's age and sex, main periods of the bear's annual
   cycle (i.e. mating and hyperphagia) and characteristics of the feeding
   sites, and (3) how the use of artificial feeding may be affecting bear
   movement patterns. We analysed the movements of 71 radio-collared brown
   bears in southern-central Finland and western Russian Karelia.
   Artificial feeding sites had several effects on brown bears in boreal
   habitats. The probability of a feeding site being used was positively
   correlated to the stability of this food resource over time, whereas
   sexes and bear classes (subadults, adults and females with cubs) did not
   show significant differences in the use of feeding sites, which were
   visited predominantly at night and slightly more during hyperphagia. The
   probability of using an artificial feeding site affected the daily net
   distance only (bears using feeding sites: 3.5 +/- 4.5 km, range: 0-29
   km; bears not using feeding sites: 4.4 +/- 4.9 km, range: 0-47 km).
   Those brown bears using artificial feeding more intensively moved
   shorter distances at a lower speed within smaller home ranges compared
   to bears that used this food sources less. Highly predictable and
   continuously available anthropogenic food may therefore have substantial
   impacts on brown bear movement patterns, ecology and health. The
   recorded changes in movement patterns support the evidence that
   artificial feeding may have important implications for bear ecology and
   conservation.},

Journal = {HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},

Pages = {314-330},
Abstract = {We conducted 300 semi-structured interviews with local people adjacent
   to Tarangire National Park, northern Tanzania, to determine their
   attitudes and perceptions toward large carnivores. We analyzed the
   relationships between attitudes and age, gender, education, occupation,
   years at residence, income, distance from protected area, livestock
   owned, live-stock lost to predators and knowledge of carnivores.
   Three-quarters of respondents (79\%) held negative attitudes toward
   large carnivores, while 20\% were generally positive. Three variables
   were positively associated with attitudes towards different species:
   formal education (all carnivore species), years at residence (lions and
   cheetahs), and knowledge of carnivores (cheetahs). Attitudes toward
   large carnivores were not significantly related to distance from
   protected area, livestock owned. or livestock lost to predators.
   Findings suggested that interventions aimed at fostering positive
   attitudes toward large carnivores should focus on improving formal
   education and securing long-term residency for people in the region.},

Journal = {AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Restrictions in technology have limited past habitat selection studies
   for many species to the home-range level, as a finer-scale understanding
   was often not possible. Consequently, these studies may not identify the
   true mechanism driving habitat selection patterns, which may influence
   how such results are applied in conservation. We used GPS dataloggers
   with digital video recorders to identify foraging modes and locations in
   which endangered Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) captured prey. We
   measured the coarse and fine-scale characteristics of vegetation at
   locations in which owls searched for, versus where they caught,
   vertebrate prey. Most prey items were caught using hover-hunting.
   Burrowing Owls searched for, and caught, vertebrate prey in all cover
   types, but were more likely to kill prey in areas with sparse and less
   dense vegetative cover. Management strategies designed to increase
   Burrowing Owl foraging success in the Canadian prairies should try to
   ensure a mosaic of vegetation heights across cover types.},

Title = {Power to detect trends in abundance within a distance sampling framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Pages = {344-353},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ensuring that inferences from biological monitoring are reliable
   requires a level of sampling effort that is commensurate with
   programmatic objectives and reflects attributes of target populations.
   Consensus guidelines have emerged to guide allocation of sampling effort
   for programmes designed to detect trends in occupancy but not for
   abundance, despite its prevalence as a target parameter. We evaluated
   the influence of population attributes (density, availability, detection
   probability and magnitude of trend) and sampling design features (number
   of sites, number of repeat surveys, and survey-year interval) on a
   Bayesian analogue of statistical power to detect declines in abundance
   estimated using distance sampling methods. For a range of values common
   to terrestrial vertebrates, we simulated spatially and temporally
   replicated populations from which we generated survey data. We then
   analysed each dataset with a hierarchical open-population model that
   allowed for temporary emigration to estimate power for periods of 5-20
   years. For a given amount of sampling effort, power to detect trends was
   highest when effort was allocated to maximizing the number of sites by
   decreasing the number of repeat surveys within a year and increasing the
   interval between survey years. For example, to have an 80\% chance of
   detecting a 3\% annual decline required 40\% longer when 67 sites were
   surveyed three times per year compared to 600 sites surveyed once every
   three years despite both allocations requiring 4,000 surveys over 20
   years. Notably, these patterns were independent of density or
   detectability of the target species, which contrasts with occupancy
   studies where optimal allocation shifts from surveying more sites to
   more repeat surveys when detectability is low or occupancy is high.
   Synthesis and applications. Our findings provide guidance for allocating
   resources efficiently for distance sampling studies focused on
   terrestrial vertebrates. By comparing the approximate density and
   detectability of target populations to those we considered, monitoring
   programmes can balance the amount of survey effort allocated to sites,
   surveys per site, and annual revisits to help ensure sufficient power to
   meet objectives effectively and efficiently. These decisions are
   increasingly important as budgets for conservation decrease and
   consequences of inaction continue to increase.},

Title = {Extreme climatic events constrain space use and survival of a

Abstract = {Two fundamental issues in ecology are understanding what influences the
   distribution and abundance of organisms through space and time. While it
   is well established that broad-scale patterns of abiotic and biotic
   conditions affect organisms' distributions and population fluctuations,
   discrete events may be important drivers of space use, survival, and
   persistence. These discrete extreme climatic events can constrain
   populations and space use at fine scales beyond that which is typically
   measured in ecological studies. Recently, a growing body of literature
   has identified thermal stress as a potential mechanism in determining
   space use and survival. We sought to determine how ambient temperature
   at fine temporal scales affected survival and space use for a
   ground-nesting quail species (Colinus virginianus; northern bobwhite).
   We modeled space use across an ambient temperature gradient (ranging
   from similar to 20 to 38 degrees C) through a MAXENT algorithm. We also
   used Andersen-Gill proportional hazard models to assess the influence of
   ambient temperature-related variables on survival through time.
   Estimated available useable space ranged from 18.6\% to 57.1\% of the
   landscape depending on ambient temperature. The lowest and highest
   ambient temperature categories (< -15 degrees C and > 35 degrees C,
   respectively) were associated with the least amount of estimated useable
   space (18.6\% and 24.6\%, respectively). Range overlap analysis
   indicated dissimilarity in areas where Colinus virginianus were
   restricted during times of thermal extremes (range overlap = 0.38). This
   suggests that habitat under a given condition is not necessarily a
   habitat under alternative conditions. Further, we found survival was
   most influenced by weekly minimum ambient temperatures. Our results
   demonstrate that ecological constraints can occur along a thermal
   gradient and that understanding the effects of these discrete events and
   how they change over time may be more important to conservation of
   organisms than are average and broad-scale conditions as typically
   measured in ecological studies.},

Abstract = {Wolf management actions are seldom universally accepted and
   understanding diverse opinions is of value for conservation
   practitioners. Previous research has either investigated cognitions or
   emotions to understand public acceptability of wolf management actions.
   We investigated both concepts simultaneously to identify whether their
   predictive potentials are mutually exclusive. A survey measuring
   wildlife value orientations, valence (positive-negative emotions) toward
   wolves, and responses to wolf management actions (doing nothing, public
   education, lethal control) was completed by 597 Dutch and German
   university students. Valence predicted the acceptability of all wolf
   management actions. Wildlife value orientations predicted the
   acceptability of lethal control and partially public education but not
   of doing nothing. Emotions thus added predictive potential next to
   cognitions to understand responses to wolf management actions. For both
   research and practice, it is important to acknowledge that the
   acceptability of wolf management actions is not only guided by what
   people think, but also by what they feel.},

Title = {Panama's illegal rosewood logging boom from Dalbergia retusa},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, illegal rosewood logging has surged worldwide,
   with much attributable to an uptick in Chinese demand. For the last
   seventy-five years, Panama's main use of cocobolo rosewood (Dalbergia
   retusa) was in small pieces for artisanal carvings, its state of
   conservation favoring merchantable timber for recent exploitation with
   the surging market. Panama's cocobolo rosewood boom was from 2011 to
   2015 and, given regulations, was largely illicit. However, no data on
   cocobolo logging have been made public. Here, we assess Panama's
   cocobolo logging. We used a media analysis of Panamanian and
   international reports on cocobolo logging from January 2000 to February
   2018 coupled with long-term socio-environmental research to show how
   logging changed during the boom. We conducted a content analysis of
   articles to address four specific objectives: 1) to assess how cocobolo
   logging intensity changed over time; 2) to determine what topics related
   to logging were important for the press to relay to the public; 3) to
   show how logging changed geographically as the boom progressed; 4) to
   demonstrate how Panama and the international community responded to the
   global boom with new policies on rosewood governance. Media reports
   indicate how cocobolo logging changed over time and space, beginning
   with the initial logging intensification in 2011 and peaking with the
   height of global rosewood logging in 2014 and 2015. Media coverage of
   illegal logging ebbed during the dry season before the May 2014
   elections, facilitating illicit logging and subsequent media coverage
   under a new administration. As logging increased, it moved from
   selective logging on western private farms to eastern Panama's forests
   held by indigenous peoples, including those with insecure tenure.
   Panama's series of cocobolo rosewood regulations allowed logging in
   indigenous lands as well as auctions of seized logs. The removal of so
   many trees during Panama's cocobolo boom, ban on cocobolo logging
   permits, coupled with global restrictions on commercial rosewoods and a
   Chinese crackdown on corruption curtailed most logging. We conclude by
   highlighting the role of media for assessing illegal logging in the
   absence of other data and underscore the difficulties of forest
   governance and logging controls for rosewoods, especially given the
   recent loosening of CITES controls for musical instruments. (C) 2020 The

Abstract = {Wild geese are increasing in agricultural and urban settings across
   Europe, leading to widespread human - geese interactions. This study
   examined how the public's acceptance of geese (attitude and acceptance
   capacity) varied depending on place dimensions, interactions with geese
   in different settings (place-based experience), and psychological
   factors, including wildlife value orientations, beliefs about the
   ecosystem services and disservices geese provide, and emotions. A survey
   was conducted in two municipalities with large goose populations in
   Sweden; Kristianstad and orebro (n = 898). Results revealed a favorable
   view of the occurrence of geese, although a substantial share believed
   the number of geese was too high. Place-based experiences of geese were
   correlated with acceptance (e.g., more experience on beaches was
   associated with a negative attitude) and the importance of psychological
   factors for acceptance was confirmed. The study highlights the need to
   consider the public's experiences of geese for sustainable goose
   management.},

Title = {Accounting for false-positive acoustic detections of bats using
   occupancy models},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {51},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1460-1467},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1. Acoustic surveys have become a common survey method for bats and
   other vocal taxa. Previous work shows that bat echolocation may be
   misidentified, but common analytic methods, such as occupancy models,
   assume that misidentifications do not occur. Unless rare, such
   misidentifications could lead to incorrect inferences with significant
   management implications.
   2. We fit a false-positive occupancy model to data from paired bat
   detector and mist-net surveys to estimate probability of presence when
   survey data may include false positives. We compared estimated occupancy
   and detection rates to those obtained from a standard occupancy model.
   We also derived a formula to estimate the probability that bats were
   present at a site given its detection history. As an example, we
   analysed survey data for little brown bats Myotis lucifugus from 135
   sites in Washington and Oregon, USA.
   3. We estimated that at an unoccupied site, acoustic surveys had a 14\%
   chance per night of producing spurious M. lucifugus detections.
   Estimated detection rates were higher and occupancy rates were lower
   under the false-positive model, relative to a standard occupancy model.
   Un-modelled false positives also affected inferences about occupancy at
   individual sites. For example, probability of occupancy at individual
   sites with acoustic detections but no captures ranged from 2\% to 100\%
   under the false-positive occupancy model, but was always 100\% under a
   standard occupancy model.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that false positives
   sufficient to affect inferences may be common in acoustic surveys for
   bats. We demonstrate an approach that can estimate occupancy, regardless
   of the false-positive rate, when acoustic surveys are paired with
   capture surveys. Applications of this approach include monitoring the
   spread of White-Nose Syndrome, estimating the impact of climate change
   and informing conservation listing decisions. We calculate a
   site-specific probability of occupancy, conditional on survey results,
   which could inform local permitting decisions, such as for wind energy
   projects. More generally, the magnitude of false positives suggests that
   false-positive occupancy models can improve accuracy in research and
   monitoring of bats and provide wildlife managers with more reliable
   information.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Landowners and game reserve managers are often faced with the decision
   whether to undertake consumptive (such as hunting) and/or
   non-consumptive (such as tourism) use of wildlife resources on their
   properties. Here a theoretical model was used to examine cases where the
   game reserve management allocated the amount of land devoted to hunting
   (trophy hunting) and tourism, based on three scenarios: (1) hunting is
   separated from tourism but wildlife is shared; (2) hunting and tourism
   co-exist; and (3) hunting and tourism are separated by a fence. The
   consumptive and non-consumptive uses are not mutually exclusive; careful
   planning is needed to ensure that multiple management objectives can be
   met. Further, the analysis indicates that the two uses may be undertaken
   in the same area. Whether they are spatially, or temporally separated
   depends on the magnitude of the consumptive use. When consumptive use is
   not dominant, the two are compatible in the same shared area, provided
   the wildlife population is sufficiently large.},

Title = {Human conflict over wildlife: exploring social constructions of African
   wild dogs (Lycuon pictus) in Botswana},
Journal = {HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {341-358},
Abstract = {Researchers argue that human-wildlife conflict (HWC) can be understood
   better in terms of conflict between humans over wildlife. We explore
   human conflict over wildlife by using a social constructionist approach
   to examine meanings of African wild dogs in Botswana. In 2013 and 2015,
   we conducted a qualitative study in four study sites by completing: (a)
   113 semi-structured interviews with individuals in the agricultural,
   conservation, and tourism sectors; (b) participant observation; and (c)
   document analysis. Our results reveal that wild dogs are socially
   constructed as problem animals, as an endangered species, and as an
   economic resource, reflecting stakeholders' diverging agendas,
   priorities, and values. The social constructions are driven by and
   emblematic of politico-economic and sociocultural trends, and competing
   development trends in Botswana. We propose: (a) seeing HWC as human
   conflict over wildlife can increase communication between
   conservationists and affected communities, and (b) integrative
   management plans that increase collaboration among stakeholder groups.},

Title = {Optimal planning to mitigate the impacts of roads on multiple species},

Abstract = {Common worldwide and encroaching on even the most remote locations,
   roads negatively affects wildlife through habitat loss, fragmentation
   and direct mortality. Reducing these effects requires mitigation,
   including wildlife crossing structures and fencing. However, mitigation
   measures are expensive and vary in their success level, especially when
   constructed to meet the needs of several species. Moreover, mitigation
   planning rarely considers the needs of multiple species. As funds are
   limited, deciding where and how to act for the greatest return on
   investment is crucial. Combining decision theory with a metapopulation
   model, we determined the most cost-effective actions mitigating the
   effects of roads on multiple species. The model is illustrated with two
   sets of species with varying of life-history traits, from a diversity of
   taxonomic groups. We tested the cost-effectiveness of spatially explicit
   combinations of three management options for each road section: (a) no
   mitigation, (b) fences without wildlife crossings, and (c) fences
   combined with wildlife crossings. We explored the trade-offs between
   each population's probability of persistence and total mitigation cost,
   first on a per-species basis and then considering all species. We then
   tested the cost-effectiveness of different planning strategies: (a)
   single species, (b) two types of focal species based on different
   life-history traits, and (c) comprehensive multispecies planning.
   Planning for the needs of all species at the same time (multispecies
   strategy) maximizes the number of persisting species and provides the
   most robust and cost-effective planning strategy, while single-species
   strategies were found to be inefficient. However, basing decisions on
   the focal species with the largest home range can provide reasonably
   cost-effective results, but should be considered only when there is not
   enough time or money to collect the necessary information to perform a
   multispecies analysis. Synthesis and applications. Our model can be
   adapted to most road mitigation problems. It illustrates that the needs
   of multiple species should be considered to plan a cost-effective road
   mitigation system. However, when resources are limited to plan for all
   species, those with larger home ranges should be used as reasonable
   proxies for other species.},

Title = {Climate change alters the trophic niche of a declining apex marine
   predator},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Pages = {2100-2107},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Changes in the world's oceans have altered nutrient flow, and affected
   the viability of predator populations when prey species become
   unavailable. These changes are integrated into the tissues of apex
   predators over space and time and can be quantified using stable
   isotopes in the inert feathers of historical and contemporary avian
   specimens. We measured delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in Flesh-footed
   Shearwaters (Puffinus carneipes) from Western and South Australia from
   1936-2011. The Flesh-footed Shearwaters more than doubled their trophic
   niche (from 3.91 +/- 1.37 parts per thousand(2) to 10.00 +/- 1.79 parts
   per thousand(2)), and dropped an entire trophic level in 75 years
   (predicted delta N-15 decreased from +16.9 parts per thousand to + 13.5
   parts per thousand, and d 13 C from -16.9 parts per thousand to -17.9
   parts per thousand) - the largest change in delta N-15 yet reported in
   any marine bird, suggesting a relatively rapid shift in the composition
   of the Indian Ocean food web, or changes in baseline delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 values. A stronger El Nino-Southern Oscillation results in a
   weaker Leeuwin Current in Western Australia, and decreased Flesh-footed
   Shearwater delta C-13 and delta N-15. Current climate forecasts predict
   this trend to continue, leading to increased oceanic `tropicalization'
   and potentially competition between Flesh-footed Shearwaters and more
   tropical sympatric species with expanding ranges. Flesh-footed
   Shearwater populations are declining, and current conservation measures
   aimed primarily at bycatch mitigation are not restoring populations.
   Widespread shifts in foraging, as shown here, may explain some of the
   reported decline. An improved understanding and ability to mitigate the
   impacts of global climactic changes is therefore critical to the
   long-term sustainability of this declining species.},

Title = {Medicinal plants potential and use by pastoral and agro-pastoral
   communities in Erer Valley of Babile Wereda, Eastern Ethiopia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {Background: Ethiopian plants have shown remarkably effective medicinal
   values for many human and livestock ailments. Some research results are
   found on medicinal plants of the south, south west, central, north and
   north western parts of Ethiopia. However, there is lack of data that
   quantitatively assesses the resource potential and the indigenous
   knowledge on use and management of medicinal plants in eastern Ethiopia.
   The main thrust of the present ethnobotanical study centres around the
   potential and use of traditional medicinal plants by pastoral and
   agro-pastoral communities in Babile Wereda (district) of eastern
   Ethiopia. The results can be used for setting up of conservation
   priorities, preservation of local biocultural knowledge with sustainable
   use and development of the resource.
   Materials and methods: Fifty systematically selected informants
   including fifteen traditional herbalists (as key informants)
   participated in the study. Semi-structured interviews, discussions and
   guided field walk constituted the main data collection methods.
   Techniques of preference ranking, factor of informant consensus and
   Spearman rank correlation test were employed in data analysis. Medicinal
   plant specimens were collected, identified and kept at the National
   Herbarium (ETH) of Addis Ababa University and Haramaya University
   Herbarium.
   Results: Fifty-one traditional medicinal plant species in 39 genera and
   28 families were recorded, constituting 37\% shrubs, 29\% trees, 26\%
   herbs, 6\% climbers and 2\% root parasites. Leaves contributed to 35.3\%
   of the preparations, roots (18.8\%) and lower proportions for other
   parts. Formulations recorded added to 133 remedies for 54 human
   ailments, in addition to some used in vector control. The majority of
   remedies were the juice of single species, mixtures being generally
   infrequent. Aloe pirottae, Azadirachta indica and Hydnora johannis were
   the most cited and preferred species. Aloe pirottae, a species endemic
   to Ethiopia, is valued as a remedy for malaria, tropical ulcer,
   gastro-intestinal parasites, gallstone, eye diseases and snake bite. The
   jel extracted from dried and ground plant material, called SIBRI (Oromo
   language), was acclaimed as a cleaner of the human colon. Concoction
   made from leaf, seed and flower of Azadirachta indica was given for
   treatment of malaria, fungal infections and intestinal worms. Root
   preparations from Hydnora johannis were prescribed as remedy for
   diarrhoea, haemorrhage, wound and painful body swelling, locally called
   GOFLA (Oromo language).
   Conclusions: The study documented many well known and effective
   medicinal species of relevance for human healthcare, including for the
   treatment of malaria which is rampant in the area as it is in many parts
   of Ethiopia. This underscores the importance of the traditional
   medicinal plants for the people living in the area and the potential of
   the resource for development. Consequently, the study area deserves
   urgent conservation priority coupled with mechanisms for the protection
   of the associated indigenous medical lore as well as development and
   effective use of the medicinal plant resource.},

Abstract = {1. Life-history theory predicts energy allocation trade-offs between
   traits when resources are limited. If females reduce allocation to
   growth when they reproduce, annual growth could reveal past reproductive
   effort, which would be useful to assess population dynamics and harvest
   sustainability. The potential and accuracy of growth measures for
   predicting reproductive success have rarely been evaluated with
   individuals with known reproductive history.
   2. We used long-term monitoring of annual growth and reproduction of
   marked female bighorn sheep and mountain goats, two species in which
   primiparity normally occurs well before growth completion, to evaluate
   growth versus reproduction trade-offs and their potential for predicting
   reproductive history of young females using mixed models and 10-fold
   block cross-validation.
   3. We documented a significant reduction in mass gain and horn growth in
   young reproducing females of both species. This trade-off was affected
   by individual differences in energy acquisition and allocation because
   population density and previous allocation to growth affected the
   trade-off. We then parameterized models to predict individual
   reproductive history of young females based on the growth traits
   subjected to a reproductive trade-off.
   4. The accuracy of predictive models ranged from 85.2\% to 91.0\% across
   species and traits, indicating that growth is a good predictor of
   reproductive history. This method is especially useful for population
   management of species with traits that form permanent visible yearly
   annuli because they retain a record of annual growth that allows
   retrospective estimation of reproductive history over multiple years.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We show that because growth significantly
   decreased in years of allocation to reproduction, annual growth
   increments provide insights on reproductive history of young females.
   Population or temporal differences in reproduction of young females
   affect demographic rates and sustainable harvest. Growth measures of
   traits that form yearly annuli, such as teeth and horns, could be easily
   obtained at a low cost from animals harvested or found dead in multiple
   species. Thus, predictive models of reproductive history based on annual
   growth could assist conservation and management in a broad range of
   species.},

Title = {Optimizing the positioning of wildlife crossing structures using GPS

Abstract = {1. Development of transportation corridors has accelerated globally,
   with infrastructure projects being implemented across remote ecosystems,
   particularly in the tropics. Such developments can have negative impacts
   on wildlife and their ecosystems. The importance of wildlife crossing
   structures to mitigate adverse effects of such features is widely
   recognized, but the siting of and investment in crossing structures is
   contentious. Data on animal movement provide valuable, highly specific
   information for such processes, but can present analytical challenges
   and remain underutilized in planning mitigation efforts.
   2. We develop two algorithms based on Integer Linear Programming to
   prioritize crossing points based on frequency of use or breadth of
   coverage among tracked individuals. These scenarios represent metrics
   likely to guide the planning of crossing structures, where the former
   may relate to the objective of minimizing vehicle-animal collisions and
   the latter on maintaining ecosystem connectivity. We exemplify the
   algorithms through application on a tracking dataset from over 150
   African elephants living near the proposed Lamu Port-South
   Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport corridor. We explore the influence of sampling
   bias on outcomes and discuss considerations to guide the application
   process.
   3. Given the generally open, unfenced nature of this ecosystem, recorded
   movements occurred throughout the system and a third of the corridor
   length in the ecosystem was intersected by recorded elephant movements.
   The selection of crossing structure locations and their impacts on
   elephants varied whether we used a subsample of elephant representative
   of local population density or total sample of monitored individuals.
   The two algorithms also selected for different crossing structure
   locations.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our work shows some of the challenges of
   using Global Positioning System telemetry in deciding where to put
   crossing structures and demonstrates the need to identify the type of
   constraints in the system and desired crossing structure characteristics
   a priori. We recommend managers carefully evaluate the presence of
   potential biases in their data. High-resolution data combined with
   objective prioritization methods allow reasoned planning actions, but
   are often lacking during critical infrastructure planning stages. Given
   the limited budget already allocated to mitigation measures in most
   proposed developments, the tools developed and applied here can
   facilitate effective spatial planning.},

Abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an infectious disease caused by a prion
   that results in neurodegeneration and death in cervids. This study uses
   Q methodology to characterize stakeholder perspectives about CWD risk
   and management on the Canadian prairies, and to understand the potential
   for CWD management using an adaptive governance framework. Workshops and
   individual interviews were conducted with 16 stakeholders in
   Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Problem definitions framed CWD as a technical
   problem calling for technical solutions. All perspectives on solutions
   focused on the importance of education and the idea that management
   should fit within a national management strategy. A unique Aboriginal
   perspective also emerged and warrants further exploration. Results also
   indicated that although stakeholders wish to be involved with CWD
   management, they trust and expect government leadership, and are
   disinterested in adaptive governance. Challenges for stakeholder
   involvement in Canadian CWD management include a lack of sufficient
   leadership and general ambivalence.},

Abstract = {Natural systems can undergo critical transitions, leading to substantial
   socioeconomic and ecological outcomes. ``Ecological resilience{''} has
   been proposed to describe the capacity of natural systems to absorb
   external perturbation and reorganize while undergoing change so as to
   still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and
   feedbacks. However, the mere application of ecological resilience in
   theoretical research and the lack of quantitative approaches present
   considerable obstacles for predicting critical transitions and
   understanding their mechanisms. Large marine ecosystems (LMEs) in the
   Northwestern Pacific are characterized by great biodiversity and
   productivity, as well as remarkable warming in recent decades. However,
   no information is available on the critical transitions and ecological
   resilience of LMEs in response to warming. Therefore, we applied an
   integrated resilience assessment framework to fisheries catch data from
   seven LMEs covering a wide range of regions, from tropical to subarctic,
   in the Northwestern Pacific to identify critical transitions, assess
   ecological resilience, and reconstruct folded stability landscapes, with
   a specific focus on the effects of warming. The results provide evidence
   of the occurrence of critical transitions, with fold bifurcation and
   hysteresis in response to increasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in
   the seven LMEs. In addition, these LMEs show similarities and
   synchronies in structure variations and critical transitions forced by
   warming. Both dramatic increases in SST and small fluctuations at the
   corresponding thresholds may trigger critical transitions. Ecological
   resilience decreases when approaching the tipping points and is
   repainted as the LMEs shift to alternative stable states with different
   resilient dynamics. Folded stability landscapes indicate that the
   responses of LMEs to warming are discontinuous, which may be caused by
   the reorganization of LMEs as their sensitivity to warming changes. Our
   study clarifies the nonlinear responses of LMEs to anthropogenic warming
   and provides examples of quantifying ecological resilience in empirical
   systems at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales.},

Abstract = {Wild dogs are a widespread, established pest in Australia and have
   economic, environmental, and social impacts. Best practice management
   recommends coordinated community-led action as a key strategy to reduce
   this vertebrate pest. This research increased understanding of how
   citizens organize to collectively manage wild dogs in three case studies
   from Australia, with attention to the interaction of cultural,
   structural, and interactional domains of group action. Information
   asymmetry and changing demographic profiles emerge as challenges to
   effective group development. Visible community leaders and strong group
   identity are important, as is peer recognition of community efforts to
   develop collective action norms. This article complements and extends
   existing quantitative data sets with qualitative analysis and contextual
   understanding, while also reflecting on the implications of collective
   action for wild dog management more broadly. This research is relevant
   for those concerned with community action and complex issues of
   vertebrate pest management.},

Title = {An assessment of South China tiger reintroduction potential in
   Hupingshan and Houhe National Nature Reserves, China},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {182},
Pages = {72-86},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Human-caused biodiversity loss is a global problem, large carnivores are
   particularly threatened, and the tiger (Panthera tigris) is among the
   world's most endangered large carnivores. The South China tiger
   (Panthera tigris amoyensis) is the most critically endangered tiger
   subspecies and is considered functionally extinct in the wild. The
   government of China has expressed its intent to reintroduce a small
   population of South China tigers into a portion of their historic range
   as part of a larger goal to recover wild tiger populations in China.
   This would be the world's first major tiger reintroduction program. A
   free-ranging population of 15-20 tigers living in a minimum of 1000
   km(2) of habitat was identified as a target. We assessed summer and
   winter habitat suitability of two critical prey species, wild boar (Sus
   scrota) and Sika deer (Cervus nippon), using GIS spatial models to
   evaluate the potential for tiger reintroduction in one likely candidate
   site, the 1100 km(2) Hupingshan-Houhe National Nature Reserve complex in
   Hunan and Hubei Provinces, China. Our preliminary analysis estimates
   that for wild boar, potential summer and winter habitat availability is
   372-714 km(2) and 256-690 km(2), respectively, whereas for Sika deer,
   potential summer and winter habitat availability is 443-747 km(2) and
   257-734 km(2), respectively. Our model identifies potential priority
   areas for release and restoration of prey between 195 and 790 km(2) with
   a carrying capacity of 596-2409 wild boar and 468-1929 Sika deer. Our
   analysis suggests that Hupingshan-Houhe could support a small population
   of 2-9 tigers at a density of 1.1-1.2 tigers/100 km(2) following prey
   and habitat restorations. Thus, current habitat quality and area would
   fall short of the target recovery goal. We identify major challenges
   facing a potential tiger reintroduction project and conclude that
   restoring the habitat and prey base, addressing concerns of local
   people, and enhancing coordination across park boundaries are
   significant challenges to meeting the broader goals of supporting a
   reintroduced wild tiger population. Tiger range states have committed to
   doubling the world's wild tigers by 2022. The results of this study have
   implications for China's commitment to this goal and for the future of
   tiger and other large carnivore reintroduction efforts in Asia and
   globally. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Black, Grey and Watch Lists of alien species in the Czech Republic based
   on environmental impacts and management strategy},
Journal = {NEOBIOTA},
Year = {2016},
Number = {28},
Pages = {1-37},
Abstract = {As legislation, research and management of invasive alien species (IAS)
   are not fully coordinated across countries or different stakeholder
   groups, one approach leading to more or less standardized activities is
   based on producing lists of prominent IAS that attain high level of
   concern and are a subject of priority monitoring and management. These
   so-called Black, Grey and Watch (alert) Lists represent a convenient
   starting point for setting priorities in prevention, early warning and
   management systems. It is important that these lists be based on
   transparent and robust criteria so as to accommodate interests and
   perception of impacts by groups of concerned authorities and
   stakeholders representing sectors as diverse as, e.g. forestry,
   horticulture, aquaculture, hunting, and nature conservation, and to
   justify possible trade restrictions. The principles for blacklisting
   need to be general enough to accommodate differences among taxonomic
   groups (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates) and invaded environments
   (e.g. aquatic, terrestrial, urban, suburban, seminatural), and must take
   into account invasion dynamics, the impact the IAS pose, and management
   strategies suitable for each particular invader.
   With these assumptions in mind, we synthesize available information to
   present Black, Grey and Watch Lists of alien species for the Czech
   Republic, with recommended categorized management measures for land
   managers, policy makers and other stakeholders. We took into account
   differences in the listed species' distribution, invasion status, known
   or estimated environmental impact, as well as possible management
   options, and apply these criteria to both plants and animals. Species
   with lower impact, but for which some level of management and regulation
   is desirable, are included on the Grey List. Some potentially dangerous
   species occurring in European countries with comparable climatic
   conditions, as well as those introduced in the past but without
   presently known wild populations in the Czech Republic, are listed on
   the Watch list. In total, there are 78 plant and 39 animal species on
   the Black List, 47 and 16 on the Grey List, and 25 and 27, respectively,
   on the Watch List. The multilayered approach to the classification of
   alien species, combining their impacts, population status and relevant
   management, can serve as a model for other countries that are in process
   of developing their Black Lists.},

   particularly for species from warm native ranges introduced into areas
   currently marginal for temperature. Although conclusions from modelling
   approaches and experimental studies are generally similar, combining the
   two approaches has rarely occurred. The aim of this study was to
   validate species distribution models by conducting field trials in sites
   of differing suitability as predicted by the models, thus increasing
   confidence in their ability to assess invasion risk. Three recently
   naturalized alien plants in New Zealand were used as study species
   (Archontophoenix cunninghamiana, Psidium guajava and Schefflera
   actinophylla): they originate from warm native ranges, are woody
   bird-dispersed species and of concern as potential weeds. Seedlings were
   grown in six sites across the country, differing both in climate and
   suitability (as predicted by the species distribution models). Seedling
   growth and survival were recorded over two summers and one or two winter
   seasons, and temperature and precipitation were monitored hourly at each
   site. Additionally, alien seedling performances were compared to those
   of closely related native species (Rhopalostylis sapida, Lophomyrtus
   bullata and Schefflera digitata). Furthermore, half of the seedlings
   were sprayed with pesticide, to investigate whether enemy release may
   influence performance. The results showed large differences in growth
   and survival of the alien species among the six sites. In the more
   suitable sites, performance was frequently higher compared to the native
   species. Leaf damage from invertebrate herbivory was low for both alien
   and native seedlings, with little evidence that the alien species should
   have an advantage over the native species because of enemy release.
   Correlations between performance in the field and predicted suitability
   of species distribution models were generally high. The projected
   increase in minimum temperature and reduced frosts with climate change
   may provide more suitable habitats and enable the spread of these
   species.},

Abstract = {The caecilian Ichthyophis longicephalus was described in 1986 based on a
   single specimen. Only one specimen has been referred subsequently to
   this species, and the validity of that referral has been questioned.
   Seven specimens discovered in 20092010 at two new localities and two
   specimens collected in 1990 from a third locality are referred here to
   I. longicephalus. These specimens are described and compared with the
   poorly preserved holotype. Mitochondrial DNA data are consistent with
   the interpretation that the new specimens represent a single species
   distinct from (and most closely related to I. tricolor among) sampled
   congeners. The previously referred specimen, from c. 320 km south of the
   type locality, is not I. longicephalus and probably represents an
   undescribed species. The rediscovery of I. longicephalus in forests and
   disturbed habitats indicates that the species probably could be
   transferred from the Data Deficient to the Least Concern category of the

Abstract = {Grassland plant community structure and function are dependent on the
   type, timing, frequency and intensity of disturbance. Grazing systems
   employing dense herds of livestock for short periods of time (e.g.
   Adaptive Multi-paddock Grazing; AMP) are gaining popularity as a
   potentially sustainable practice. Effects of AMP systems on plant
   diversity and composition are unknown, though theory provides some
   expectations. Spatially homogeneous grazing used by AMP may be a uniform
   ecological filter, thereby lowering plant diversity; alternatively, the
   AMP practice of using multiple paddocks might enhance habitat
   heterogeneity. Maintaining plant diversity, particularly of native
   species, is a key aspect of sustainability. As such, an understanding of
   the real-world effects of AMP grazing is needed. We studied grasslands
   within 18 pairs of ranches across the northern Great Plains. Ranches
   managed under AMP were paired with a neighbouring ranch (N-AMP) using
   regionally representative grazing practices. We collected surveys of
   management practices and conducted 2 years of on-farm sampling to
   identify plant composition and diversity. Ranch management practices
   used by self-identified AMP ranchers differed significantly (p < 0.1)
   from those used on neighbouring ranches, with higher stocking densities
   (number of animals per area at a single time) but not stocking rates
   (total number of animals per unit time per area) on AMP relative to
   N-AMP ranches. There were fewer plant species in AMP grasslands at both
   the plot and landscape scales compared to N-AMP ranches despite no
   overall difference in plant community composition. Management type did
   not alter the variability of plant community composition (beta
   diversity) or plot-level species evenness. Although there were trends
   for lower diversity of native and introduced species at both spatial
   scales, a significant effect was found only for native species at the
   landscape scale. Synthesis and applications. The impacts of AMP grazing
   system management were limited to a minor reduction in plant diversity,
   with a modest decline in native species richness. We conclude that the
   benefits of AMP grazing in the northern Great Plains do not include the
   maintenance of plant diversity, and this system could hinder the
   conservation of remaining native plant species.},

Title = {Linking ecosystem services to a coastal bay ecosystem health assessment:
   A comparative case study between Jiaozhou Bay and Daya Bay, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {135},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coastal bays, situated within Earth's critical zone, play important
   ecological and socioeconomic roles. This study developed an integrated
   ecosystem health assessment framework based on ecosystem services
   specific to coastal bays, particularly exploring approaches to determine
   critical indicators and establish a reference benchmark. The framework
   was applied to two typical coastal bays (Jiaozhou Bay and Daya Bay) to
   ascertain significant health differences, subsequent challenges and
   prospective management. Comparatively, Daya Bay was healthier. Daya Bay
   received an overall comprehensive index ecosystem health score of 69.42
   (good); however, its ecosystem services scores differed significantly
   (supporting services = 71.34, regulating services = 87.29, provisioning
   services = 3.59, cultural services = 74.30), indicating severe
   degradation in its ecosystem food provisioning function. Jiaozhou Bay
   received corresponding score of 55.79 (moderate), and its ecosystem
   services scores were relatively lower (supporting services = 63.31,
   regulating service = 54.30, provisioning services = 6.18, and cultural
   services = 54.74), indicating widespread ecosystem degradation. The
   health status of coastal bays is closely associated with both natural
   characteristics and human interventions. The narrow bay mouth of
   Jiaozhou Bay, its limited enclosed seawater area, and the intensive land
   reclamation that has taken place since the 1950s have directly or
   indirectly led to the low score of most of its indicators, particularly
   regarding the significant reductions in its water area and shoreline.
   The geological advantages of Daya Bay is its large area of water and
   that it is open to the outer sea, which have contributed to its
   comparatively healthier status, wherein scores of only a few indicators
   were bad (i.e., biological indicators of sensitive organisms in the
   upper food chain). Results from this study provide important information
   for prospective bay management. For Jiaozhou Bay, more effort should be
   paid to improving ecosystem health in a comprehensive way, particularly
   fishing control, land reclamation control and habitat restoration. For
   Daya Bay, overfishing should be better controlled, while more emphasis
   should be paid to protecting and restoring certain moderately specific
   habitats and species. For effective management, we highlight that
   ecosystem management strategies needs to be differentiated among
   different bays based on their significant natural and social features.
   Our approach provides a practical ecosystem health assessment tool that
   can be applied to other coastal bays to better inform sustainable
   management and conservation initiatives.},

Abstract = {Understanding the role of different species in the transmission of
   multi-host pathogens, such as rabies virus, is vital for effective
   control strategies. Across most of sub-Saharan Africa domestic dogs
   Canis familiaris are considered the reservoir for rabies, but the role
   of wildlife has been long debated. Here we explore the multi-host
   transmission dynamics of rabies across south-east Tanzania. Between
   January 2011 and July 2019, data on probable rabies cases were collected
   in the regions of Lindi and Mtwara. Hospital records of animal-bite
   patients presenting to healthcare facilities were used as sentinels for
   animal contact tracing. The timing, location and species of probable
   rabid animals were used to reconstruct transmission trees to infer who
   infected whom and the relative frequencies of within- and
   between-species transmission. During the study, 688 probable human
   rabies exposures were identified, resulting in 47 deaths. Of these
   exposures, 389 were from domestic dogs (56.5\%) and 262 from jackals
   (38.1\%). Over the same period, 549 probable animal rabies cases were
   traced: 303 in domestic dogs (55.2\%) and 221 in jackals (40.3\%), with
   the remainder in domestic cats and other wildlife species. Although
   dog-to-dog transmission was most commonly inferred (40.5\% of
   transmission events), a third of inferred events involved
   wildlife-to-wildlife transmission (32.6\%), and evidence suggested some
   sustained transmission chains within jackal populations. A steady
   decline in probable rabies cases in both humans and animals coincided
   with the implementation of widespread domestic dog vaccination during
   the first 6 years of the study. Following the lapse of this program, dog
   rabies cases began to increase in one of the northernmost districts.
   Synthesis and applications. In south-east Tanzania, despite a relatively
   high incidence of rabies in wildlife and evidence of
   wildlife-to-wildlife transmission, domestic dogs remain essential to the
   reservoir of infection. Continued dog vaccination alongside improved
   surveillance would allow a fuller understanding of the role of wildlife
   in maintaining transmission in this area. Nonetheless, dog vaccination
   clearly suppressed rabies in both domestic dog and wildlife populations,
   reducing both public health and conservation risks and, if sustained,
   has potential to eliminate rabies from this region.},

Title = {Socioecological and environmental predictors of physiological stress
   markers in a threatened feline species},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {In recent years, ecological studies have shown that oxidative status can
   have a significant impact on fitness components in freeranging animals.
   This has raised awareness by conservation practitioners about the
   importance of identifying the factors associated with individual
   variation in markers of oxidative status because this might provide
   several potential benefits for conservation programmes. In this study,
   we measured five markers of oxidative status in the cheetah (Acinonyx
   jubatus), a carnivore species classified as vulnerable by the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature. We asked whether the
   five measures of oxidative damage and antioxidant blood-based markers
   are associated with a number of socioecological and environmental
   factors, including individual sex, age class, living condition
   (free-ranging vs. captive), restraint duration stress (i.e. capture
   duration stress), spatial tactic of males (territory holders vs.
   non-territory holders, i.e. floaters) and reproductive status of females
   (accompanied by offspring vs. solitary). Markers of oxidative damage
   were higher in those cheetahs that were physically restraint for a
   longer duration in the trap, indicating that oxidative stress may be
   increased by short-term unpredictable environmental stressors. Markers
   of oxidative damage were also higher in captive than free-ranging
   cheetahs, suggesting that oxidative stress might be a physiological
   mechanism underlying the detrimental effects of captivity on the health
   status of cheetahs. Variation of oxidative status markers was also
   significantly associated with individual age class, spatial tactic and
   reproductive status, opening new research avenues about the role of
   oxidative stress in influencing behavioural and life-history traits in
   cheetahs.},

Title = {Quantifying the impacts of Australian bushfires on native forests and
   gray-headed flying foxes},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfires in
   many regions of the world. Changing fire regimes have been shown to
   delay vegetation recovery and shift distribution of ecosystems,
   increasing the importance of understanding the short-and long-term
   impacts of these changes. The unusually severe 2019-2020 Australian
   bushfire season has been linked to climate change and the impacts on
   wildlife and ecosystems are still being studied. We use remotely sensed
   thermal data to assess the differences between annual fire seasons from
   2012 to 2019 in eastern Australia to understand the unique
   characteristics of the 2019-2020 anomalous fire season. We use spatial
   and temporal monitoring data of the vulnerable gray-headed flying fox
   (Pteropus poliocephalus) and its habitat to examine evidence for fire
   impacts on these important forest pollinators. We analyze roost
   occupancy in response to a previous fire season and use these results to
   identify roosts that are particularly affected by the 2019-2020 fires.
   During the 2019-2020 anomalous fire season, mega-fires, defined as
   contiguous fires over 10,000 hectares (ha) each, burned over 60\% of the
   total affected area and occurred mostly in forested areas. This is in
   contrast to previous fire seasons in which smaller, scattered fires
   burned mostly non-forested areas. While we found little evidence that
   gray-headed flying fox reacted directly to fires in a previous season,
   unburned winter habitat was a key predictor of roost occupancy. The
   2019-2020 anomalous fire season burned nearly ten times the amount of
   total habitat (33.7\%) across the gray-headed flying fox range compared
   to the previous season. Critical winter habitats, including a species in
   fire refugia, were also substantially more burned in the anomalous fire
   season. Much of the winter habitat that burned in the anomalous fire
   season was within high or extreme severity fires (41.7\%), causing
   substantial canopy consumption of these species. This work highlights
   the utility of remotely sensed thermal data for rapidly mapping fire
   impacts to wildlife and vegetation and highlights areas of habitat key
   for the conservation of these vulnerable populations.

Title = {Oxygen limitations on marine animal distributions and the collapse of
   epibenthic community structure during shoaling hypoxia},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2989-3004},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Deoxygenation in the global ocean is predicted to induce ecosystem-wide
   changes. Analysis of multidecadal oxygen time-series projects the
   northeast Pacific to be a current and future hot spot of oxygen loss.
   However, the response of marine communities to deoxygenation is
   unresolved due to the lack of applicable data on component species. We
   repeated the same benthic transect (n=10, between 45 and 190m depths)
   over 8years in a seasonally hypoxic fjord using remotely operated
   vehicles equipped with oxygen sensors to establish the lower oxygen
   levels at which 26 common epibenthic species can occur in the wild. By
   timing our surveys to shoaling hypoxia events, we show that fish and
   crustacean populations persist even in severe hypoxia (<0.5mLL(-1)) with
   no mortality effects but that migration of mobile species occurs.
   Consequently, the immediate response to hypoxia expansion is the
   collapse of community structure; normally partitioned distributions of
   resident species coalesced and localized densities increased. After
   oxygen renewal and formation of steep oxygen gradients, former ranges
   re-established. High frequency data from the nearby VENUS subsea
   observatory show the average oxygen level at our site declined by
   similar to 0.05mLL(-1)year(-1) over the period of our study. The
   increased annual duration of the hypoxic (<1.4mLL(-1)) and severely
   hypoxic periods appears to reflect the oxygen dynamics demonstrated in
   offshore source waters and the adjacent Strait of Georgia. Should the
   current trajectory of oxygen loss continue, community homogenization and
   reduced suitable habitat may become the dominant state of epibenthic
   systems in the northeast Pacific. In situ oxygen occurrences were not
   congruent with lethal and sublethal hypoxia thresholds calculated across
   the literature for major taxonomic groups indicating that research
   biases toward laboratory studies on Atlantic species are not globally
   applicable. Region-specific hypoxia thresholds are necessary to predict
   future impacts of deoxygenation on marine biodiversity.},

Title = {Large herbivore population performance and climate in a South African
   semi-arid savanna},
Journal = {KOEDOE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Long-term population performance trends of eight large herbivore species
   belonging to groups of disparate foraging styles were studied in the
   semi-arid savanna of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Over the
   past century the number of bulk feeders (buffalo, waterbuck, blue
   wildebeest and plains zebra) had increased towards comparatively high
   population densities, whereas population numbers of selectively feeding
   antelope species (sable antelope, roan antelope, tsessebe and eland)
   declined progressively. Detailed analyses revealed that population
   numbers of buffalo and waterbuck fluctuated in association with food
   quantity determined by rainfall. Population performance ratings
   (1944-2003) of the species for which forage quality was important (blue
   wildebeest, zebra and selective grazers) were correlated negatively with
   minimum temperature and positively with dry-season rainfall.
   Interpretation according to a climate-vegetation response model
   suggested that acclimation of forage plants to increasing temperature
   had resulted in temperature-enhanced plant productivity, initially
   increasing food availability and supporting transient synchronous
   increases in population abundance of both blue wildebeest and zebra, and
   selective grazers. As acclimation of plants to concurrently rising
   minimum (nocturnal) temperature (T-min) took effect, adjustments in
   metabolic functionality occurred involving accelerated growth activity
   at the cost of storage-based metabolism. Growth-linked nitrogen dilution
   and reduced carbon-nutrient quality of forage then resulted in phases of
   subsequently declining herbivore populations. Over the long term
   (1910-2010), progressive plant functionality shifts towards accelerated
   metabolic growth rather than storage priority occurred in response to
   Tmin rising faster than maximum temperature (T-max), thereby
   cumulatively compromising the carbonnutrient quality of forage, a key
   resource for selective grazers.
   The results of analyses thus revealed consistency between herbivore
   population trends and levels of forage quantity and quality congruent
   with expected plant metabolic responses to climate effects. Thus,
   according to the climate-vegetation response model, climate effects were
   implicated as the ultimate cause of large herbivore population
   performance in space and over time.
   Conservation implications: In its broadest sense, the objective of this
   study was to contribute towards the enhanced understanding of
   landscape-scale functioning of savanna systems with regard to the
   interplay between climate, vegetation and herbivore population dynamics.},

Abstract = {Common strategies to protect swimmers from unprovoked shark bite
   incidents on coastal beaches are controversial. We surveyed beach users
   on two Sydney beaches to gauge their knowledge and attitudes to current

   relatively strong (> 60\%) support for their use. In contrast, beach
   users were overwhelming against (> 80\%) the general culling of sharks,
   and also opposed (> 70\%) the strategy of catching and killing sharks
   following a shark bite incident. There was little difference between
   genders in their attitudes to each strategy, but the oldest age category
   (51+) surveyed was generally most supportive of the lethal strategies.
   The results demonstrated the dichotomies in public attitudes to the
   different mitigation strategies, particularly passive versus active
   culling, and highlighted the need for greater public education for the

Title = {Geographic range size and extinction risk assessment in nomadic species},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {865-876},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Geographic range size is often conceptualized as a fixed attribute of a
   species and treated as such for the purposes of quantification of
   extinction risk; species occupying smaller geographic ranges are assumed
   to have a higher risk of extinction, all else being equal. However many
   species are mobile, and their movements range from relatively
   predictable to-and-fro migrations to complex irregular movements shown
   by nomadic species. These movements can lead to substantial temporary
   expansion and contraction of geographic ranges, potentially to levels
   which may pose an extinction risk. By linking occurrence data with
   environmental conditions at the time of observations of nomadic species,
   we modeled the dynamic distributions of 43 arid-zone nomadic bird
   species across the Australian continent for each month over 11 years and
   calculated minimum range size and extent of fluctuation in geographic
   range size from these models. There was enormous variability in
   predicted spatial distribution over time; 10 species varied in estimated
   geographic range size by more than an order of magnitude, and 2 species
   varied by >2 orders of magnitude. During times of poor environmental
   conditions, several species not currently classified as globally
   threatened contracted their ranges to very small areas, despite their
   normally large geographic range size. This finding raises questions
   about the adequacy of conventional assessments of extinction risk based
   on static geographic range size (e.g., IUCN Red Listing). Climate change
   is predicted to affect the pattern of resource fluctuations across much
   of the southern hemisphere, where nomadism is the dominant form of
   animal movement, so it is critical we begin to understand the
   consequences of this for accurate threat assessment of nomadic species.
   Our approach provides a tool for discovering spatial dynamics in highly
   mobile species and can be used to unlock valuable information for
   improved extinction risk assessment and conservation planning.
   Tamano de Extension Geografica y Evaluacion de Riesgo de Extincion en
   Especies Nomadas El tamano de extension geografica se conceptualiza
   frecuentemente como un atributo fijo de las especies y se trata como tal
   para los propositos de cuantificacion de riesgo de extincion; se asume
   que las especies que ocupan extensiones geograficas mas pequenas tienen
   un riesgo de extincion mas alto, cuando todo lo demas es igual. Sin
   embargo, muchas especies son moviles y sus movimientos varian desde
   migraciones de ida y vuelta relativamente predecibles hasta movimientos
   irregulares complejos, como los que muestran las especies nomadas. Estos
   movimientos pueden llevar a expansiones sustanciales temporales y a una
   reduccion de las extensiones geograficas, todo esto con el potencial de
   llegar a niveles que pueden presentar un riesgo de extincion. Al enlazar
   los datos de presencia con las condiciones ambientales al momento de la
   observacion de las especies nomadas pudimos modelar las distribuciones
   dinamicas de 43 especies de aves de zonas aridas a lo largo de la isla
   de Australia durante cada mes a lo largo de once anos y calculamos el
   tamano de extension minima y el alcance de las fluctuaciones en el
   tamano de extension geografica a partir de estos modelos. Hubo una
   enorme variabilidad en la distribucion espacial pronosticada a lo largo
   del tiempo: diez especies variaron en el tamano de extension geografica
   por mas de una orden de magnitud y dos especies variaron por mas de dos
   ordenes de magnitud. Durante situaciones de condiciones ambientales
   pobres, varias especies que actualmente no se encuentran clasificadas
   como amenazadas a nivel global redujeron sus extensiones a areas muy
   pequenas, esto a pesar de su gran tamano de extension geografica normal.
   Este hallazgo genera preguntas sobre lo idoneo de las evaluaciones
   convencionales del riesgo de extincion con base en el tamano estatico de
   extension geografica (p. ej.: la Lista Roja de la UICN). Se pronostica
   que el cambio climatico afectara los patrones de las fluctuaciones de
   recursos en casi todo el hemisferio sur, donde el nomadismo es la forma
   dominante de movimiento de animales, asi que es critico que comencemos a
   entender las consecuencias de esto para tener una evaluacion certera del
   riesgo de extincion de especies nomadas. Nuestra estrategia proporciona

Abstract = {The fungal disease white-nose syndrome (WNS) has caused mass mortality
   in some species of North American bats during hibernation.
   We use population viability models to test if a hypothetical WNS
   treatment or management action could facilitate the recovery of
   WNS-affected little brown myotis Myotis lucifugus populations. We
   modelled scenarios altering three parameters: (a) WNS severity
   (population growth rate of WNS-affected populations; lambda(WNS)); (b)
   proportion of population treated; and (c) treatment improvement in
   winter survival (TIWS).
   Our models predict that a treatment or management action that targets an
   entire population with a TIWS of 40\% (the average TIWS in bat trials to
   date) will cause a population to stabilize or increase if WNS causes an
   annual decline of less than 70\% (i.e. lambda(WNS) > 0.30). However, for
   severe WNS (lambda(WNS) = 0.10), the TIWS must be at least 54\% to cause
   a population to stabilize or increase. Where only a proportion of a
   WNS-affected population is treated, population stability is much harder
   to achieve unless the impact of WNS attenuates over time.
   Our models suggest that a treatment or management action only
   facilitates the recovery of WNS-affected populations if WNS is mild,
   TIWS is high, and a large proportion of the population can be treated.
   If a small proportion of the population is treated, it is easier to
   facilitate recovery if WNS severity attenuates over time.
   Synthesis and applications. We modelled the predicted abundance
   trajectory of white-nose syndrome-affected little brown myotis Myotis
   lucifugus populations in response to a hypothetical treatment or
   management action. Our two types of models incorporate the complete
   range of possible scenarios varying three parameters: (a) population
   growth rate of the white-nose syndrome-affected population, (b) the
   improvement in winter survival associated with the treatment or
   management action, and (c) the proportion of the population treated. We
   suggest that our models, which can be explored using online Shiny
   applications, should be used in the planning phase of treatment or
   management action programmes for white-nose syndrome.},

Title = {Quantifying the attractiveness of garden flowers for pollinators},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {803-817},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There is great interest in planting urban areas to benefit pollinating
   insects, with the potential that urban areas and gardens could act as an
   extensive network of pollinator-friendly habitats. However, there are a
   great many different plant cultivars available to the gardener, and a
   paucity of evidence-based advice as to which plants are truly most
   attractive to flower-visiting insects. Here, we report insect visitation
   to metre square plots of 111 different ornamental plant cultivars at a
   site in central UK. Data were collected over 5 years, and comprise over
   9000 insect observations, which were identified to species (for
   honeybees and bumblebees) or as `solitary bees', Syrphidae, Lepidoptera
   and `others'. Unlike some previous studies, we found no difference in
   numbers of insects attracted to native or non-native species, or
   according to whether plants were annuals, biennials or perennials, but
   we did find that native plants attracted a significantly higher
   diversity of flower-visiting insects. Overall, the most-visited plants
   were Calamintha nepeta, Helenium autumnale and Geranium rozanne.
   However, patterns of visitation were quite different for every insect
   taxa examined. For example, different species of short-tongued
   bumblebees showed little overlap in their most-preferred plant
   cultivars. Interestingly, very similar plant cultivars often attracted
   different insect communities; for example, 72\% of visitors to Aster
   novi belgii were honeybees or bumblebees, while the related Anthemis
   tinctoria, which also has daisy-like flowers, did not attract a single
   honeybee or bumblebee but was popular with solitary bees, hoverflies,
   and `other' pollinators. Some plant cultivars such as Eryngium planum
   and Myosotis arvensis were attractive to a broad range of insects, while
   others attracted only a few species but sometimes in large numbers, such
   as Veronicastrum virginicum and Helenium autumnale which were both
   visited predominantly by honey bees. It is clear that we do not yet
   fully understand what factors drive insect flower preferences.
   Recommendations are made as to which flower cultivars could be combined
   to provide forage for a diversity of pollinator groups over the season
   from early spring to autumn, though it must be born in mind that some
   plants are likely to perform differently when grown in different
   environmental conditions.},

Title = {Habitat Selection by the Endangered New Mexico Meadow Jumping Mouse on

Abstract = {The New Mexico meadow jumping mouse Zapus hudsonius luteus is endemic to
   the American Southwest. It has undergone severe declines in distribution
   over the past century and it has been listed as endangered under the
   Endangered Species Act. The goal of this study was to determine current
   status and habitat selection by the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse at
   three spatial scales (landscape, macrohabitat, microhabitat) on a
   managed high-order floodplain. We hypothesized that the New Mexico
   meadow jumping mouse is a habitat specialist that might rely on specific
   habitat components at multiple spatial scales. The study occurred at
   Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico. In comparison
   with the status of the species 2 decades ago, the New Mexico meadow
   jumping mouse was rare, with only 29 individuals captured. Trapping
   results and radiotelemetry of 20 individuals revealed that the current
   population existed along 2.7 km of a single irrigation canal. At the
   landscape scale, the distribution of the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse
   was determined by selection of canals, water, foxtail barley Hordeum
   jubatum herbaceous temporarily flooded association, and narrowleaf
   willow Salix exigua mesic graminoids shrubland association. At the
   macrohabitat scale, jumping mice selected canals and Hordeum jubatum
   herbaceous temporarily flooded association. At the microhabitat scale,
   jumping mice selected areas that were near water and contained moist
   soils, dense herbaceous canopy cover, dogbane Apocynum cannabinum,
   foxtail barley, and common threesquare Schoenoplectus pungens; jumping
   mice avoided habitats represented by eight plant species, including
   mule-fat Baccharis salicifolia, kochia Bassia scoparia, and saltcedar
   Tamarix ramosissima. Jumping mice only occurred where there is an
   overlap of the required habitats at all three scales and this may be a
   key limiting factor for the New Mexico meadow jumping mice at Bosque del
   Apache National Wildlife Refuge. Habitats used by jumping mice during
   maternal nesting and hibernation contained more woody plants and woody
   debris than at other times of their life cycle. Information gained from
   this study can help land managers protect and create habitat conditions
   required by the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse.},

Title = {More losses than gains in ground-nesting bees over 60 years of
   urbanization},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Along with agricultural intensification, urbanization is often
   implicated in bee declines worldwide. While the vast majority of studies
   investigate how bee assemblages respond to urbanization across different
   spatial scales, very few attempts have used a temporal comparison to
   evaluate the impact of urbanization. The city of Curitiba in southern
   Brazil is unique for having long-term data of bees, and thus is a good
   model for studying urban temporal changes. The main goal of this study
   is to investigate how a ground-nesting assemblage responded to six
   decades of urban growth in Curitiba. In this time lapse the city
   population grew from 140 thousand to almost 2 million inhabitants. We
   demonstrate a 94\% decline in nest abundance, a 35\% decline in species
   richness, and a 24\% decline in phylogenetic diversity from 1955 (T1) to
   2018 (T2). Temporal beta diversity values between T1 and T2 were very
   high and most sampling sites were dominated by losses in nest abundance.
   All sampling sites changed similarly with losses in nesting substrates
   (i.e. exposed soil) and a substantial increase in surrounding impervious
   surface. This study exhibits how depletion of nesting substrates
   combined with increases in urban cover can affect pollinators, a
   concerning scenario as most bees nest in friable soil and thus are
   strongly susceptible to urbanization. We emphasize that urban planning
   policies to protect ground-nesting bees are essential to preserve the
   important ecological service of pollination in cities.},

Title = {Invasion of annual grasses following wildfire corresponds to maladaptive
   habitat selection by a sagebrush ecosystem indicator species},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Numerous wildlife species within semi-arid shrubland ecosystems across
   western North America are experiencing substantial habitat loss and
   fragmentation. These changes in habitat are often attributed to a
   diverse suite of factors including prolonged and increasingly severe
   droughts, conifer expansion, anthropogenic development, domestic and
   feral livestock grazing, and invasion of exotic annual grasses, which
   promotes increased wildfire frequency and severity. Greater sage-grouse
   (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter, sage-grouse) are considered an
   indicator of sagebrush ecosystem health and have experienced widespread
   population decline associated with habitat loss and degradation, as well
   as changes in predator communities. Our objectives were to model and map
   sage-grouse habitat selection and survival during the important
   brood-rearing life stage in relation to landscape-scale environmental
   predictors. Furthermore, we sought to understand impacts of wildfire and
   annual grass invasion on brood habitat, as these accelerated disturbance
   regimes are a primary cause of habitat loss within the Great Basin
   region of the USA. We used a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework to
   estimate resource selection functions and survival for early and late
   brood-rearing stages of sage-grouse in relation to a broad suite of
   habitat characteristics evaluated at multiple spatial scales within the
   Great Basin from 2009 to 2019. Sage-grouse selected for greater
   perennial grass cover, higher relative elevations, and areas closer to
   springs and wet meadows during both early and late brood-rearing.
   Terrain characteristics, including heat load and aspect, were important
   in survival models, as was variation in shrub height. We also found
   strong evidence for higher survival for both early and late broods
   within previously burned areas, but survival within burned areas
   decreased as annual grass cover (i.e. cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum)
   increased. This interaction effect demonstrates how invasion of annual
   grasses into burned areas, which has become prevalent in Great Basin
   sagebrush ecosystems, can lead to maladaptive habitat selection by
   brood-rearing greater sage-grouse. Understanding these complex
   relationships aids wildlife conservation and habitat management as
   wildfire and annual grass cycles continue to accelerate across western
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Using the Capitella complex to investigate the effects of sympatric
   cryptic species distinction on ecological and monitoring studies in
   coastal areas},
Journal = {MARINE BIODIVERSITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The polychaete Capitella capitata is historically one of the most
   commonly used indicators of organic enrichment in marine benthic
   environments. However, this taxon has been used to refer to several
   cryptic species with distinct environmental tolerances, which may
   compromise ecological assessment and monitoring programs. In this study,
   we aimed to (1) assess the overlap and patterns of dominance in the
   spatial and temporal distribution and response to environmental
   variability of different species of the C. capitata complex in an
   urbanized coastal area and (2) investigate how the taxonomic resolution
   (species vs genera) could affect the observed patterns (i.e., whether
   the acknowledgement of cryptic species may affect the outcome of
   ecological assessments). Eight sampling campaigns were carried out from
   September 2011 to September 2013 in a heavily anthropized tidal flat in
   Southeastern Brazil. Four species of the complex were identified.
   Capitella nonatoi was the most abundant (similar to 80\% of the total
   abundance). Overall, the four species of Capitella showed high overlap
   in spatial distribution, especially between the most abundant ones. At
   community level, taxonomic resolution did not influence the perceived
   relationships with environmental and spatial variables, a result likely
   driven by the dominance of C. nonatoi and relatively high spatial
   overlap among species. The assemblage was influenced mainly by
   chlorophyll a and hydrocarbons, corroborating the indicator status of
   the taxa. At species level, however, individual response to
   environmental variability differed, suggesting that species may have
   distinct requirements. Thus, the use of a particular taxonomic
   resolution in ecological studies depends on the questions to be
   addressed. The recognition of cryptic diversity may be important for
   biodiversity assessments and studies at the population level (i.e.,
   dynamics, behavior). Although further studies are needed to corroborate
   the observed patterns of dominance at larger scales, for community-level
   assessments, our results suggest that identifying Capitella to species
   level may not be needed for local ecological monitoring.},

Title = {Hemolytic parasites affect survival in migrating red-tailed hawks},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Migrating birds face a myriad of hazards, including higher exposure to
   parasites and numerous competing energy demands. It follows that
   migration may act as a selective filter and limit population growth.
   Understanding how individual-level physiological condition and disease
   status scale up to population dynamics through differential survival of
   individuals is necessary to identify threats and management
   interventions for migratory populations, many of which face increasing
   conservation challenges. However, linking individual physiological
   condition, parasite infection status and survival can be difficult. We
   examined the relationship among two measures of physiological condition
   {[}scaled-mass index and heterophil/leukocyte (H/L) ratio], hematozoa
   (i.e. hemoparasites) presence and abundance, and constitutive immunity
   in 353 autumn migrating red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis calurus)
   from 2004 to 2018. Hematazoa (i.e. Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon) were
   in the blood smears from 139 red-tailed hawks (39.4\%). H/L ratio
   decreased with scaled-mass index. Adults had a significantly higher H/L
   ratio than juveniles. Our two measures of immune defences,
   hemolytic-complement activity and bacteria-killing ability, were highly
   positively correlated. Our most notable finding was a negative
   relationship between Haemoproteus parasitemia and survival (i.e.
   documented individual mortality), indicating that haemosporidian
   parasites influence survival during a challenging life stage. The effect
   of haemosporidian parasites on individuals is often debated, and we
   provide evidence that parasitemia can affect individual survival. In
   contrast, we did not find evidence of trade-offs between survival and
   immune defences.},

Title = {Values, animal symbolism, and human-animal relationships associated to
   two threatened felids in Mapuche and Chilean local narratives},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 13},
Abstract = {Background: The Chilean temperate rainforest has been subjected to
   dramatic fragmentation for agriculture and forestry exploitation.
   Carnivore species are particularly affected by fragmentation and the
   resulting resource use conflicts with humans. This study aimed at
   understanding values and human-animal relationships with negatively
   perceived threatened carnivores through the disclosure of local stories
   and Mapuche traditional folktales.
   Methods: Our mixed approach comprised the qualitative analysis of 112
   stories on the kodkod cat (Leopardus guigna) and the puma (Puma
   concolor) collected by students (9-14 years) from 28 schools in the
   Araucania region within their family contexts, 10 qualitative in-depth
   interviews with indigenous Mapuche people, 35 traditional Mapuche
   legends, and the significance of naming found in ethnographic
   collections.
   Results: We revealed a quasi-extinction of traditional tales in the
   current knowledge pool about pumas and kodkods, local anecdotes,
   however, were present in significant numbers. Values associated to both
   felids were manifold, ranging from negativistic to positive values.
   While pumas played an important role in people's spirituality, negative
   mythological connotations persisted in kodkod stories. Four prominent
   relationships were derived: (1) Both felids represent threats to
   livestock, pumas even to life, (2) both felids are symbols for upcoming
   negative events, (3) pumas are spiritual creatures, and (4) kodkods are
   threatened by humans. Recommendations are provided for stimulating new
   ways of perceiving unpopular and threatened carnivores among those who
   live in vicinity to them.},

Title = {Who is abuzz about bees? Explaining residents' attitudes in Phoenix,

Abstract = {Many stressors plague bee populations including habitat fragmentation
   and degradation, as well as pathogens and pesticide exposure. With bee
   communities at risk, conservation efforts are imperative. Although
   recent research has examined bee communities across cities, few studies
   have analyzed variation in human attitudes toward and perceptions of
   bees, or how these perspectives might influence bee conservation. We
   therefore analyzed residents' attitudes toward and perceptions of bees,
   specifically in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Primarily drawing upon
   2017 survey data (n = 496, 39\% response rate), we posed the following
   questions: 1) What cognitive, environmental, and social factors explain
   whether people like or dislike bees? and 2) How do attitudes and
   perceptions about bees relate to land management practices, specifically
   landscaping choices, herbicide and pesticide use, and desert plantings?
   Overall, attitudes toward bees were mostly neutral with a slight trend
   toward dislike but most residents did not believe bees were problematic
   at their homes. Additional findings reveal that risk perceptions,
   ecological worldviews, and pet ownership significantly explained
   attitudes toward bees. Moreover, people who live closer to desert parks
   had relatively positive attitudes toward bees. Regarding yard management
   practices, both attitudes toward and perceptions of bees were positively
   correlated with adding desert plants to residential yards. Moreover,
   people who use pesticides had more negative attitudes toward bees. Our
   results indicate conservation potential for urban bee populations, for
   example, by planting native vegetation in residential areas near desert
   preserves. We hope this study will result in more attitudinal research
   on bee species and other understudied urban wildlife.},

Abstract = {Rabies virus (RV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) can cause significant
   mortality in wild carnivore populations, and RV threatens human lives.
   We investigated serological patterns of exposure to CDV and RV in
   domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus),
   black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas), spotted hyenas (Crocuta
   crocuta), striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) and African lions (Panthera
   leo), over a 10-year period, in a Kenyan rangeland to assess the role
   domestic dogs may play in the transmission dynamics of these two
   important canid pathogens. Observed patterns of RV exposure suggested
   that repeated introduction, rather than maintenance, occurred in the
   wild carnivore species studied. However, RV appeared to have been
   maintained in domestic dogs: exposure was more likely in domestic dogs
   than in the wild carnivores; was detected consistently over time without
   variation among years; and was detected in juveniles (a parts per
   thousand currency sign1-year-old) as well as adults (> 1-year-old). We
   conclude that this domestic dog population could be a RV reservoir. By
   contrast, the absence of evidence of CDV exposure for each carnivore
   species examined in the study area, for specific years, suggested
   repeated introduction, rather than maintenance, and that CDV may require
   a larger reservoir population than RV. This reservoir could be a larger
   domestic dog population; another wildlife species; or a
   ``metareservoir{''} consisting of multiple interconnected carnivore
   populations. Our findings suggest that RV risks to people and wild
   carnivores might be controlled by domestic dog vaccination, but that CDV
   control, if required, would need to target the species of concern.},

Title = {Indirect detection of genetic dispersal (movement and breeding events)
   through pedigree analysis of dugong populations in southern Queensland,
   Australia},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {91-101},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Understanding the patterns of movement and breeding within and between
   wildlife populations is important for the assessment of conservation
   status of endangered species, the development of conservation management
   strategies and priorities, and the prediction of population behaviour
   based on future threats. Methods for determining long term gene flow and
   dispersal are well researched, but analysis of recent movement is more
   difficult, typically relying on real-time tracking of individuals using
   telemetry, or through identification of marked individuals at multiple
   locations. These methods are limited by the considerable sampling effort
   required over time periods sufficient to recapture individuals in
   multiple locations. In contrast, we can infer recent movement from a
   reconstructed pedigree based on genetic and ancillary biological data,
   by identifying parent-offspring relationships in which the parent and
   offspring may be found in different locations. Hence, this method can
   use a single sampling period to identify movement and possibly
   associated breeding events over the last one or two generations. This
   study demonstrates the utility of reconstructed pedigrees in inferring
   recent movements in a dugongs distributed across a number of spatially
   distinct foraging locations in southern Queensland, Australia. Dugongs,
   which are classified as vulnerable to extinction, have long lifespans
   and protracted breeding cycles and give birth to single offspring at
   irregular intervals, implying a complex pedigree without distinct
   generational structure or large sibling groups. A pedigree was
   constructed for 1002 different dugongs across four locations in southern
   Queensland: Moreton Bay (n = 630), the Great Sandy Straits (n = 281),
   Hervey Bay (n = 59) and Shoalwater Bay (n = 27) using PR-genie software.
   PR-genie is a pedigree reconstruction system designed specifically for
   complex multigenerational wildlife pedigrees based on genetic identity
   (microsatellite DNA) and including ancillary biological data (sex and
   body size-class). Movements of genetically tagged individuals between
   locations were detected as parent-offspring links found across
   locations. Approximately 30\% of assigned parents had at least one
   offspring found in a different location, implying recent movement of the
   parent or offspring. Where multiple individuals in a family are present,
   parsimonious explanations of movement indicate that male dugongs move
   between populations more frequently than females. Markedly more movement
   between locations was found than has been previously possible to detect
   through repeated direct sampling of individuals or through telemetry.

Title = {Effect of habitat characteristics on mesocarnivore occurrence in urban
   environment in the Central Europe},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {893-909},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although urbanization is generally considered a major threat to local
   and global biodiversity, some recent studies have shown that urban
   environments provide suitable habitat for some wildlife species,
   including carnivores, yet little is known about the factors that
   determinate their occurrence and habitat preferences. The main aim of
   this study was to examine the relative importance of habitat
   characteristics in relation to carnivore occurrence along an urban-rural
   gradient in the Central Europe. Carnivore occurrence was monitored using
   scent stations (summer period) and snow tracking (winter period) in the
   regional city which was divided into the network of 154 quadrates (25
   ha/quadrate) for the purposes of this study. From a total of six
   recorded native carnivore species, the stone marten Martes foina and the
   least weasel Mustela nivalis were the most dominant and widespread
   species in both study periods. PCA analysis revealed the existence of
   two informative axes corresponding to (A) urban vs. non-urban habitat
   and (B) residential vs. industrial areas. Surprisingly, the only species
   exhibiting marked habitat selectivity and avoidance of highly urbanized
   areas was the red fox (i.e. negative correlation with the first PCA
   axis). The stone marten tends to avoid industrial areas and prefers
   residential areas; however its presence/absence was not associated with
   the first PCA axis. On the other hand, the ermine stoat and the least
   weasel were relatively unselective according to our results. In
   conclusion, our results demonstrate high adaptability of various species
   of carnivore mesopredators to urban environment; however their response
   to the level of urbanization and habitat characteristics exhibits
   interspecific variation.},

Abstract = {Although the banded murex (Hexaplex trunculus) is extensively exploited
   by hand harvesting in intertidal areas along the Gulf of GabSs (southern
   Tunisia), there is scarce information available on this fishing activity
   and on the population status of this muricid gastropod species. In this
   context, the present study aimed to characterise the harvesting activity
   and analyse the spatial distribution, abundance, biomass, population
   structure and mortality of H. trunculus. Sampling surveys were performed
   during March-August 2009 using quadrats (100 m(2)) in 721 sampling
   stations distributed along 157 transects perpendicular to the coastline.
   Overall, 6608 H. trunculus were collected with broad ranges in both
   shell length (13.6-78.5 mm) and total weight (0.2-63.8 g). GIS-produced
   maps were employed to illustrate the species spatial distribution, by
   extrapolating the estimated abundance, biomass and mortality to the
   total intertidal area surveyed in the Gulf of GabSs. This study provides
   baseline data on the local populations of H. trunculus, which
   constitutes valuable information for proposing conservation and
   management measures aiming ultimately to achieve the sustainable
   exploitation and long-term preservation of this coastal fishing resource
   from the Gulf of GabSs.},

Title = {The importance of herbivore density and management as determinants of
   the distribution of rare plant species},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {205},
Pages = {77-84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Herbivores are often drivers of ecosystem states and dynamics and in
   many situations are managed either as livestock or through controlled or
   exploitative hunting of wild populations. Changes in herbivore density
   can affect the composition of plant communities. Management of herbivore
   densities could therefore be regulated to benefit plant species of
   conservation concern. In this study we use a unique spatial dataset of
   large herbivores in Norway to test whether herbivore density affects the
   distribution of rare red-listed plant species in tundra ecosystems, and
   to identify regions where herbivore density is the most important factor
   in determining the habitat suitability for the plant species. For all
   selected species a climatic variable was the most important determinant
   of the distribution, but herbivore density was an important determinant
   of some species notably Primula scandinavica. Herbivore density was the
   most important factor determining habitat suitability for this species
   in 13\% of mainland Norway. Regions of Norway where the management of
   herbivore densities is most strongly linked to the habitat suitability
   of red-listed plant species are mapped. However, there was very low
   concordance in the localities of these areas; at any individual
   locality, habitat suitability was limited by herbivore density for only
   a small subset of the species. This suggests that management of
   herbivores for the benefit of rare plant species needs to be tailored
   for individual locations or species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Understanding unexpected reintroduction outcomes: Why aren't European
   bison colonizing suitable habitat in the Carpathians?},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {195},
Pages = {106-117},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Reintroductions are an important tool for re-establishing or reinforcing
   populations of threatened species, and thus to restore ecosystems.
   However, predicting how reintroduced populations will spread is
   difficult, and past reintroductions often lacked a thorough assessment
   of habitat availability and connectivity. Using the case of reintroduced
   European bison (Bison bonasus L.) in the northern Carpathians, we show
   how habitat suitability models in combination with connectivity
   assessments based on circuit theory can remedy such shortcomings, and
   identify potential habitat patches and corridors between these. European
   bison were reintroduced in our study area in the 1960s, and against
   prior expectation, have not spread along the Carpathian ridge, but
   instead expanded their range towards human settlements. Our analyses
   provide an explanation for this pattern. Although we identified a
   network of suitable habitat patches along the Carpathian ridge, the
   functional connections between them were limited due to a number of
   major barriers to movement. To avoid future conflicts between European
   bison and people, and to achieve the long-term goal of a viable bison
   metapopulation in this region, conservation action should focus on
   establishing connectivity between habitat patches through the creation
   and legal protection of corridors and wildlife passages, which would
   benefit Carpathian wildlife in general. Our study emphasizes the
   importance of landscape-scale connectivity analyses to guide restoration
   efforts, and of adaptive management to ensure the success of
   reintroduction projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In recent years lion bones have been legally traded internationally to
   Asian markets from captive-bred sources in South Africa. There are also
   indications of increasing instances of illegal international trade in
   wild lion bones. The existence of parallel captive and wild supplies of
   lion bone are a cause of law enforcement concern regarding the potential
   for the laundering of illegally sourced bones through legal trade, and
   present a problem for the assessment of the conservation impact of wild
   lion bone trade due to the difficulty of determining what market-share
   wild and captive-bred lion bones account for. Captive-bred and wild lion
   bone are visually indistinguishable and no reliable method currently
   exists for distinguishing them. We present a preliminary study that
   explores the use of DART mass spectrometry as a method to differentiate
   between captive-bred and wild lion bones. We find that DART is able to
   differentiate between a batch of captive-bred South African lion bone
   and a batch of wild lion bone and suggest that DART mass spectrometry
   shows strong potential as a tool for the regulation and investigation of
   lion bone trade. Further testing is needed to prove the suitability of
   this technique. Therefore, we suggest that further research focuses on
   testing the capability of DART to differentiate between contemporary
   wild and captive-bred lion bone originating from South Africa, and
   attempts to identify chemical markers in bone that can be used as
   indicators of captive-bred origin.},

Title = {Characteristics and determinants of human-carnivore conflict in South
   African farmland},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Reducing human-carnivore conflict may provide conservation, social and
   economic benefits, but designing suitable mitigation activities requires
   information regarding underlying anthropogenic and environmental
   determinants. To obtain those data, we interviewed game and livestock
   farmers in Limpopo province, South Africa from March to August 2011. We
   quantified (1) human-carnivore conflict characteristics; (2)
   determinants of perceived carnivore predation levels and; (3)
   determinants of retaliatory persecution of carnivores. Carnivores
   reportedly killed 1.4 \% of total game and domestic livestock holdings
   and the median annual rate of loss was ZAR 1.23 ha(-1), which is
   generally not sufficient to threaten farming livelihoods or the
   provincial economy. Farmers reportedly killed 303 carnivores in the year
   prior to the interview, 44 of which were threatened species. African
   wild dogs were the least tolerated species, followed by cheetahs,
   although these species were only blamed for 6 and 3 \% of reported kills
   respectively. The main determinants of human-carnivore conflict were
   high elevation, mixed purpose farming (i.e., stocking both game and
   livestock), dense vegetation cover and high perceived financial losses.
   The results suggest a number of potential conflict-mitigation strategies
   which include addressing predation problems in areas with a high
   proportion of vulnerable farms, improving tolerance of carnivores among
   low-tolerance social groups and correcting misconceptions about the
   provenance and financial impact of local carnivore populations. This
   information has already lead to the implementation of several suitably
   tailored mitigation activities.},

Title = {Roads influence movement and home ranges of a fragmentation-sensitive
   carnivore, the bobcat, in an urban landscape},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {180},
Pages = {224-232},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Roads in urbanized areas can impact carnivore populations by
   constraining their movements and increasing mortality. Bobcats (Lynx
   rufus) are felids capable of living in urban environments, but are
   sensitive to habitat fragmentation and, thus, useful indicators of
   landscape connectivity; in particular, bobcat habitat selection,
   movement, and mortality may be affected by roads. We analyzed movement
   patterns of 52 bobcats in southern California in three study sites and
   investigated: (1) how bobcats responded to two types of roads within
   their home ranges; (2) how they placed their home ranges with respect to
   roads within the study area; and (3) whether male and female bobcats
   differed in their behavioral responses to roads. Within home ranges,
   primary and secondary roads did not influence movements, but bobcats
   more frequently crossed secondary roads when road densities were higher
   within their home ranges, thus increasing mortality risk. However, road
   densities within each study site were several times higher than road
   densities within home ranges, suggesting bobcats selected against roaded
   areas in home-range placement. Male home ranges bordering roads were
   smaller than home ranges for other males, but male home ranges
   containing roads were larger than those without roads. Male bobcats also
   were more likely to cross roads than females, potentially reflecting
   larger male home range sizes. Our results suggest roads have important
   impacts on urban bobcats, with stronger effects on males than females,
   and continued efforts to mitigate the effects of roads on carnivores and
   other fragmentation-sensitive species would help promote connectivity
   conservation in urban systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Wildebeest migration drives tourism demand in the Serengeti},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {248},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We examine tourism demand for an iconic ecological resource - the
   migration of similar to 1.3 million wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus)
   in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. The wildebeest migration generates
   economic benefits through ecotourism, which we investigated by combining
   quantitative tools from spatial ecology and environmental economics with
   wildebeest GPS collar data and lodge use data from Serengeti National
   Park. We used GLMMs and random utility models to quantify the effect of
   the distance from lodges to wildebeest hotspots on two important aspects
   of demand: the number of tourists visiting lodges in the park
   (participation); and the tourists' choice of where to stay during their
   visit (site choice). We find that longer distances between lodges and
   wildebeest hotspots significantly reduced tourist participation (i.e.
   the total number of tourists visiting lodges) and site choice (the
   probability of tourist groups choosing a lodge). Lodge price had a
   positive effect on participation, but it did not affect site choice for
   international tourist groups. Whilst our results are specific to the
   Serengeti, the methods presented here can be applied to any system in
   which non-consumptive wildlife viewing is the foundation of local
   ecotourism. As such, this novel approach provides a new perspective on
   the economics of wildlife management and strengthens the case for the
   continued conservation of ecosystems that contain wildlife resources.
   Due to the high value of the wildebeest migration to tourism, we suggest
   that future expansion of tourist infrastructure in the Serengeti should
   proceed in ways that minimise disturbance to this living resource.},

Title = {Public attitudes towards ``pest{''} management: Perceptions on squirrel
   management strategies in the UK},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {222},
Pages = {52-63},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The impacts of non-native, invasive grey squirrels (Sciurus
   carolinensis) on broadleaf woodlands and red squirrel population
   (Sciurus vulgaris) are well recognised among wildlife professionals, yet
   efforts to control the species across its expanding range require
   substantial time and resources. Through collaboration, wildlife
   professionals and communities can more effectively implement the
   population monitoring and control programmes necessary to conserve
   native species under threat. However, for such collaboration to be
   successful, wildlife professionals must first understand public
   attitudes towards grey squirrels, and the control methods available.
   Through a national level survey (n = 3758) we examine the UK public's
   attitudes to red and grey squirrels, and the acceptability of seven
   control methods. Results show that much of the public have little
   knowledge of the grey squirrel's negative impacts. In fact, contrary to
   the notion of a pest species, the presence of grey squirrels is often
   desirable. Furthermore, those control methods recommended by wildlife
   professionals are regarded by the public as some of the least
   acceptable. Those most accepting of controls include males, older
   generations, those most knowledgeable about squirrels and people who are
   aware of squirrel management being practiced in their local area. To
   foster more fruitful collaboration, wildlife professionals should raise
   awareness of why particular control methods are preferred, highlight the
   damage grey squirrels cause to other valued species, and offer local
   communities a variety of roles which contribute to the wider goal of
   native species conservation.},

Title = {Emergy evaluation of a swamp dike-pond complex: A new ecological
   restoration mode of coal-mining subsidence areas in China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {107},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The swamp dike-pond complex (SDPC) is a mode of ecological restoration
   in coal-mining subsidence areas in China that consists of an engineered
   swamp and an engineered dike-pond. The aim of this study is to compare
   conventional reclamation and ecological restoration systems by
   performing emergy analysis. The analysed systems included an SDPC and
   contrasting fish ponds (CFP) in a stabilized subsidence area and an SDPC
   in a submergence area that can be used as a transition system during the
   course of the succession of coal-mining subsidence areas. Indices,
   ratios and ternary diagrams based on emergy can be used to assess the
   behaviours of the three systems. Emergy analysis was well suited for
   this task because it was capable of converting all energies, materials
   and information to a common unit of quality to allow for deep
   comparisons across the three systems.
   The results show that the SDPC was most dependent upon renewable
   resources, and efforts were made to maintain the natural mechanisms of
   energy and matter flow regulation as much as possible. Therefore, the
   SDPC has greater emergy efficiency in terms of biological energy use and
   the level of environmental loading. The CFP was more dependent on the
   fraction of purchased inputs and nonrenewable inputs from the outside.
   The sustainability index values for the three systems ranged from 0.82
   for the CFP in the stabilized subsidence area to 4.31 for the SDPC in
   the submergence area and 9.12 for the SDPC in the stabilized subsidence
   area. The results confirm that the SDPC is less stressful on the
   environment and more sustainable than the CFP in coal-mining subsidence
   areas. In addition, the respective ecosystem service values for each
   system were 1.52E + 17 sej/yr/ha for the SDPC in the stabilized
   subsidence area and 2.90E + 16 sej/yr/ha for the SDPC in the submergence
   area, which were 10.1 and 1.9 times higher than the value for the CFP,
   respectively. This research suggests that vegetation, faunal communities
   and functional hydrology, which support the entire ecosystem via the
   food web, can be restored in the SDPC, and restored wetlands can provide
   economic and ecological benefits via the return of their ecological
   services and functions. Endangered and rare species, such as Baer's
   pochard (Aythya baeri) and reed parrotbill (Paradoxornis heudei), were
   found in this area, and the prospects of such species depend on future
   restoration policies in coal-mining subsidence areas in China. To
   safeguard biodiversity, SDPCs should be preferred over other reclamation
   methods. This work will inform environmental policy making and be used
   to recommend better management practices to the government.},

Abstract = {Wildlife trade imposes direct and indirect negative impacts on the
   environment but particularly through the continual introduction of
   species beyond their native range. The high demand for various
   ornamental plant species at global scale, combined with modern and more
   efficient modes of trade (i.e., e-commerce) highlight the horticultural
   trade industry as a point of major conservation concern. Historically,
   ferns are well documented as being a popular ornamental plant group and
   recent studies have highlighted their high propensity towards invasion.
   Despite this, no studies have considered the role of trade as a driver
   of invasiveness in this large plant group. In this study we developed an
   inventory of traded terrestrial true ferns (Polypodiophyta) using
   catalogues from on-ground (i.e., brick and mortar) and e-commerce (i.e.,
   online) nurseries across 6 major trading countries: Australia, Canada,
   New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States of
   America. A total of 382 traded ferns including alien and native species
   were identified. Generalised linear models were used to determine which
   market and species traits influenced the probability of establishment
   success in the country of trade. The final model highlighted that
   various market traits positively affected the likelihood of
   establishment success in alien ferns, i.e., the number of varieties and
   cultivars available for a species (a proxy for the effects of
   horticultural manipulation and ecotypic variation), a high market
   presence, and trade via e-commerce. Species traits such as a broad
   native range and successful establishment elsewhere were also important
   predictors. Three families (Dryopteridaceae, Pteridaceae, and
   Polypodiaceae) were identified as the most popular fern families in
   trade. These families have also contributed a significant portion of
   alien and invasive ferns in this and previous studies and are commonly
   promoted by horticulturalists. Twenty-nine out of 261 traded alien fern
   species were identified as having successfully invaded regions other
   than the country of trade as well as having a high market presence, with
   Dryopteris erythrosora, Dryopteris cycadina, Polystichum polyblepharum,
   and Cyrtomium falcatum being of particular concern. This study
   emphasised the role of horticultural trade in invasion success in alien
   ferns and highlighted the value of early detection through screening
   horticultural catalogues to identify introduced and potentially invasive
   species that should be monitored in trade.},

Title = {Elk distribution and spatial overlap with livestock during the
   brucellosis transmission risk period},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {471-478},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {P>1. The presence of Brucella abortus within free-ranging wildlife
   populations is an important conservation and management issue because of
   the risk of brucellosis transmission between wildlife and livestock.
   Predicting wildlife distributions is necessary to forecast wildlife and
   livestock spatial overlap and the potential for brucellosis
   transmission.
   2. We used Global Positioning System data collected from
   telemetry-collared female elk Cervus elaphus to develop resource
   selection function (RSF) models during the brucellosis transmission risk
   period (the abortion and calving periods). We validated extrapolation of
   predictive models at two nearby elk ranges within the Greater
   Yellowstone Ecosystem. Additionally, we integrated extrapolated RSF maps
   and domestic livestock distributions to estimate the relative
   probability of elk and livestock commingling during the brucellosis
   transmission risk period.
   3. The top-ranked model predicted that areas selected by elk had a lower
   probability of wolf Canis lupus occupancy, were privately owned and
   south facing, and had steeper slopes, lower road densities and higher
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Elk selected forests and
   shrublands over grasslands; however, the strength of selection decreased
   as snowpack increased. Elk selection for privately owned lands may lead
   to spatial overlap with livestock and increase the risk of elk and
   livestock intermingling. Furthermore, if both elk and livestock
   concentrate in areas of higher NDVI, increased spatial overlap may occur
   in these areas.
   4. Predictive accuracy was highest in the study area where the model was
   developed. When compared to the model development area, predictive
   accuracy of extrapolated RSF maps was similar or better in one of the
   elk ranges and lower in the other elk range.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Extrapolated RSF and spatial overlap maps
   can provide a foundation for identifying the highest risk areas of elk
   and livestock spatial overlap during the brucellosis transmission risk
   period. However, the predictive accuracy of the models is limited when
   applied to different areas. Site-specific models of spatial overlap
   would therefore be needed to provide the most accurate estimates of elk
   and livestock spatial overlap during the transmission risk period. The
   degree to which spatial overlap may lead to actual transmission risk
   needs to be investigated as this is not yet known and could have
   important implications for managing transmission risk.},

Title = {Seasonal Foraging by Forest Mice Enhances Loss of Weed Seeds from
   Crop-Field Edges},
Journal = {NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {8},
Pages = {5-17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Native seed predators, such as mice (Peromyscus spp.) and ground beetles
   (Carabidae), consume weed seeds and waste grain within agricultural
   fields and thus provide a potentially important service to farmers. Most
   previous investigations of agricultural seed predation services have
   focused on within-field factors that affect rates of seed removal and
   consumption by field-resident seed predators. However, seasonal migrants
   from adjacent non-crop habitats may also contribute to removal of weed
   seed, particularly along field edges. We investigated whether rates of
   weed seed removal within fields increased during summer crop growth when
   Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis (White-Footed Mouse), a ubiquitous
   forest-dwelling rodent in the eastern US, seasonally migrates into crop
   fields from adjacent forested woodlots. We used exclosure experiments to
   quantify the relative number of Setaria faberi (Giant Foxtail) seeds
   removed from seed trays by vertebrate and invertebrate seed predators
   within 4 corn fields in central Indiana during 4 different stages of
   crop growth (emergence {[}May], vegetative {[}July], reproductive
   {[}August], post-harvest {[}November]). Seed-removal experiments were
   coupled with live trapping of rodents and pitfall sampling of
   invertebrates to identify seed predators. Vertebrates (mice) contributed
   nearly twice as much (similar to 50\%) to seed removal compared to
   invertebrates (similar to 25\%), irrespective of season. Rates of
   invertebrate consumption differed among seasons but were not affected by
   distance from forest-field edge. Rates of seed removal by mice
   significantly interacted with season and distance from field edge, with
   higher rates of seed loss near forest-field edges during July and August
   even though mouse abundance showed no strong association with distance.
   Increased seed loss near (within 90 m) forest-field edges was presumably
   due to consumption by seasonally field-resident White-footed Mice, which
   constituted the majority (>70\%) of mouse captures near field edges.
   Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii (Prairie Deer Mouse) is a year-round
   resident in crop fields and most likely contributed to seed loss nearer
   field interiors, where they comprised >90\% of the rodents caught.
   Although non-crop habitats are often overlooked as a source of seed
   predation services, our results indicate that forest-dwelling
   White-footed Mice likely supplement rates of in-field predation on weed
   seed. Future investigations of seed-predation services should consider
   the role of resident and seasonally opportunistic seed predators in
   regulation of weed populations in crop fields.},

Title = {Using landscape connectivity to predict human-wildlife conflict},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {248},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict has serious conservation consequences, both for
   populations of wildlife and for the people who live alongside them.
   Connectivity analyses can incorporate species-specific landscape
   resistance, and therefore have the potential to be used to understand
   where wildlife moves and causes conflict with people. We used circuit
   theory to develop connectivity models for the African savanna elephant
   in northwestern Botswana based on step-selection functions of movement
   data for 15 elephants and tested whether areas of high connectivity were
   correlated with occurrences of crop raiding. We used government records
   and field assessments of crop-raiding incidents between 2010 and 2016 to
   quantify conflict, which we predicted would correlate with landscape
   connectivity. The step-selection model revealed that linear boundaries
   such as rivers, fences, and dune crests were barriers to movement that
   impacted connectivity, while high vegetation index values and distance
   from villages were strong positive predictors of movement. Connectivity
   values were positively and significantly correlated with frequency of
   conflict incidents (p < 1.5e - 06) over a six-year time span. However,
   connectivity had no predictive value for whether fields were raided (p <
   .54) or how frequently a field was raided (p < .77) during a single
   growing season. This study shows that connectivity may be a useful
   metric for predicting patterns of conflict occurrence over broad
   temporal scales, but may have limited predictive power at shorter time
   scales. It is crucial that conservation and conflict mitigation efforts
   recognize that methods may be appropriate for different purposes at
   different scales.},

Title = {Substituting space for time: Empirical evaluation of spatial replication
   as a surrogate for temporal replication in occupancy modelling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},
Number = {2},
Pages = {754-765},

Abstract = {1. Occupancy models that account for detection probability are important
   analytical tools in conservation monitoring. Traditionally, occupancy
   models relied on detection/non-detection data generated from temporal
   replicates for estimating detectability. Due to logistical challenges
   and financial costs involved, many large-scale field studies instead use
   spatial replication as a surrogate. The efficacy of the two approaches
   and their statistical validity has generally sought support from
   simulation- based inferences rather than empirical data.
   2. Using the sloth bear Melursus ursinus as an example, we compared
   estimates of occupancy and detection probabilities obtained from
   temporal and spatial sampling designs. We carried out temporally
   replicated camera trap surveys and spatially replicated sign surveys
   across a 754-km(2) area around Bhadra Tiger Reserve in the Western Ghats
   of India.
   3. We sampled along forest/coffee plantation roads in 58 grid cells of
   13 km(2) each, treating these cells as independent sites. We used the
   standard single-season model for the camera trap survey data, and the
   single-season correlated detections model (with Markovian dependence)
   for the sign survey data, and incorporated ecological covariates that
   likely influenced occupancy and detection probabilities.
   4. Occupancy estimates from the two surveys and corresponding modelling
   approaches were similar {[}(psi) over cap (c)((SE) over cap) = 0.58
   (0.03) for camera trap surveys; (psi) over cap (s) ((SE) over cap) =
   0.56 (0.03) for sign surveys]. In both cases, the influence of
   covariates corroborated our a priori predictions. Site-level estimates
   of occupancy from the two methods were highly correlated (r =.78). We
   generated a combined estimate of sloth bear occupancy in the region as
   an inverse-variance weighted average of the two estimates {[}(psi) over
   cap((SE) over cap) = 0.57 (0.02)].
   5. Synthesis and applications. Studies that aim to evaluate occupancy
   models should account for spatial variation in occupancy/detection
   probabilities, particularly when making inferences on species-habitat
   relationships. We show that spatial replication can serve as a good
   surrogate for temporal replication in occupancy studies, which may be
   useful for distribution assessments of species when field resources are
   limited or logistical challenges preclude traditional survey approaches
   that yield temporally replicated data. Our results therefore provide a
   basis for efficient targeting of funds and field resources, particularly
   for practitioners involved in monitoring species at large landscape
   scales.},

Title = {Evaluating habitat suitability and connectivity for a recolonizing large
   carnivore},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {242},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The conservation of wide-ranging species presents challenges in a world
   of intensified human land use, forcing animals to occupy and recolonize
   human-modified landscapes. Although identifying suitable habitat and
   ensuring connectivity are important in supporting natural
   recolonization, these actions are rarely validated due to difficulties
   in monitoring such events. In Sweden, the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) is
   now recolonizing its former range, after centuries of persecution. We
   investigated resource selection based on telemetry data from 108 lynx
   monitored over 20 years. We assessed the differences between the
   established population in central Sweden and the recolonizing population
   in southern Sweden, and between established and dispersing individuals.
   We found that models based on central Sweden successfully identified
   core habitat patches for establishment in southern Sweden, validated
   after recolonization. We also found that lynx selected for higher
   habitat suitability during the recolonization phase, and that dispersing
   individuals were less selective than established lynx. Using
   cost-distance analysis, we assessed connectivity between central and
   southern Sweden, and found that landscape permeability was higher when
   based on dispersing lynx compared to established lynx. Altogether, our
   findings suggest that when landscapes are sufficiently similar between
   source and recolonization areas, resource selection information from an
   established population can be useful for managers seeking to facilitate
   recolonization of wide-ranging species. We recommend more frequent use
   of validation during and after recolonization events, to improve our
   common understanding of habitat suitability and connectivity modeling,
   and therefore to enable more active management of recolonization events.},

Title = {Shifting targets in the tundra: Protection of migratory caribou calving
   grounds must account for spatial changes over time},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {147},
Number = {1},
Pages = {163-173},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Industrial development, expansion of human populations and climate
   change increasingly affect habitats of migratory species. Effective
   protection of critical habitats is urgently required because several
   large migratory species have declined over the last decades. Protection
   of critical habitats, such as the calving grounds of migratory
   ungulates, may however require consideration of temporal shifts in
   spatial location. We assessed changes in the location of calving grounds
   used by migratory caribou over 35 years by the Riviere-George (RG) herd
   and 15 years by the Riviere-aux-Feuilles (RAF) herd, in Northern Quebec
   and Labrador, Canada. We also evaluated the proportion of annual calving
   ground within protected Wildlife Habitats established to protect caribou
   calving grounds. The annual size and location of calving grounds changed
   substantially over time: calving ground size remained relatively stable
   for the RAF but it declined over 85\% for the RG. Calving grounds moved
   300 km northward in the Ungava peninsula for the RAF and shifted over
   230 km back and forth to the Labrador coast for the RG. Despite recent
   modifications. legally designated Wildlife Habitats in Quebec protected
   less than 20\% of the RG and RAF calving grounds. Protection of calving
   grounds of migratory caribou must consider the dynamic use of space by
   adult females. We present recommendations on the use of available
   monitoring data to better protect calving grounds of migratory caribou
   and critical habitats of large migratory species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {We examined the development of coral reef science and the policies,
   institutions, and governance frameworks for management of coral reefs in
   China in order to highlight the wicked problem of preserving reefs while
   simultaneously promoting human development and nation building. China
   and other sovereign states in the region are experiencing unprecedented
   economic expansion, rapid population growth, mass migration, widespread
   coastal development, and loss of habitat. We analyzed a large,
   fragmented literature on the condition of coral reefs in China and the
   disputed territories of the South China Sea. We found that coral
   abundance has declined by at least 80\% over the past 30 years on
   coastal fringing reefs along the Chinese mainland and adjoining Hainan
   Island. On offshore atolls and archipelagos claimed by 6 countries in
   the South China Sea, coral cover has declined from an average of >60\%
   to around 20\% within the past 1015 years. Climate change has affected
   these reefs far less than coastal development, pollution, overfishing,
   and destructive fishing practices. Ironically, these widespread declines
   in the condition of reefs are unfolding as China's research and
   reef-management capacity are rapidly expanding. Before the loss of
   corals becomes irreversible, governance of China's coastal reefs could
   be improved by increasing public awareness of declining ecosystem
   services, by providing financial support for training of reef scientists
   and managers, by improving monitoring of coral reef dynamics and
   condition to better inform policy development, and by enforcing existing
   regulations that could protect coral reefs. In the South China Sea,
   changes in policy and legal frameworks, refinement of governance
   structures, and cooperation among neighboring countries are urgently
   needed to develop cooperative management of contested offshore reefs.},

Abstract = {High densities of wild African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana)
   combined with widespread human land-use have increased human-elephant
   conflict in northern Botswana. Visible impacts (e.g. crop/property

   documented in scholarly literature while hidden impacts (e.g. emotional
   stress, restricted mobility) are less so. This research uses qualitative
   methods to explore human experiences with elephants and perceived
   impacts of elephants on human well-being. Findings reveal participants
   are concerned about food insecurity and associated visible impacts of
   elephant crop raids. Findings also reveal participants are concerned
   about reduced safety and restricted mobility as hidden impacts
   threatening livelihoods and everyday life. Both visible and hidden
   impacts of elephants contribute to people's negative feelings towards
   elephants, as does the broader political context. This research
   emphasises the importance of investigating both visible and hidden

Title = {Capture and commercialization of blue land crabs ({''}guaiamum{''})
   Cardisoma guanhumi (Lattreille, 1825) along the coast of Bahia State,
   Brazil: an ethnoecological approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {Background: Blue Land Crab (Cardisoma guanhumi) is one of the most
   important crustacean species captured and commercialized in Brazil.
   Although this species is not considered to be threatened with
   extinction, populations of C. guanhumi are known to be rapidly
   diminishing due to heavy harvesting pressures and degradation of their
   natural habitats, highlighting the necessity of developing and
   implanting management and protection strategies for their populations.
   There have been no ethnozoological publications that have focused
   specifically on C. guanhumi, in spite of importance of this type of
   information for developing efficient management plans of resource
   utilization. So, the present work describes the ethnoecological aspects
   of the capture and commercialization of C. guanhumi by a fishing
   community in northeastern Brazil.
   Methods: Field work was carried out in the municipality of Mucuri, Bahia
   in Brazil, between the months of January and March/2011 through the use
   of open semi-structured interviews with all of the crustacean harvesters
   in city who acknowledged their work in capturing this species, totaling
   12 interviewees. The informants were identified through the use of the
   ``snowball{''} sampling technique. In addition to the interviews
   themselves, the ``guided tour{''} technique and direct observations was
   employed.
   Results: According all the interviewees, the C. guanhumi is popularly
   called ``guaiamum{''} and is collected in ``apicum{''} zones. They
   recognize sexual dimorphism in the species based on three morphological
   characteristics and the harvesters also pointed two stages in the
   reproductive cycle during the year and another phase mentioned by the
   interviewees was ecdysis. All of the interviewed affirmed that the size
   and the quantities C. guanhumi stocks in Mucuri have been diminishing.
   All of the interviewees agreed that the species and other mangrove
   resources constituted their principal source of income. The harvesters
   dedicated three to five days a week to collect Blue Land Crabs and the
   principal technique utilized for capturing is a trap called a
   ``ratoeira{''} (rat-trap).
   Conclusions: The results of the present work demonstrated that the
   community retains a vast and important volume of knowledge about C.
   guanhumi that could subsidize both scientific studies and the
   elaboration of viable management and conservation strategies for this
   species.},

Title = {Contrasting bottom-up effects of warming ocean on two king penguin
   populations},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Abstract = {Breeding success is often correlated with climate, but the underlying
   bottom-up mechanisms remain elusive-particularly in marine environments.
   Consequently, conservation plans of many species often consider climate
   change as a unilateral threat, ignoring that even nearby populations can
   show contradicting trends with climate. Better understanding the
   relationship between climate and environment at different scales can
   help us interpret local differences in population trends, ultimately
   providing better tools to evaluate the global response of a species to
   threats such as global warming. We studied a growing king penguin
   population nesting at Kerguelen island (Southern Indian Ocean), hosting
   one of the largest colonies in the world. We used a unique dataset of
   foraging, breeding success, and climate data spanning over 25 years to
   examine the links between climate, marine environment, and breeding
   success at this colony. The results were then compared to the
   neighboring population of Crozet, which experienced the steepest decline
   for this species over the past few decades. At Crozet, penguins
   experienced lower breeding success in warmer years due to productive
   currents shifting away from the colony, affecting foraging behavior
   during chick rearing. At Kerguelen, while chick mass and survival
   experienced extreme variation from year to year, the annual variation
   was not associated with the position of the currents, which varied very
   little compared to the situation in Crozet. Rather than being affected
   by prey distribution shifts, we found evidence that chick provisioning
   in Kerguelen might be influenced by prey abundance, which seem to rather
   increase in warmer conditions. Furthermore, warmer air temperature in
   winter increased chick survival rate, likely due to reduced
   thermoregulation cost. Investigating the mechanisms between climate and
   fitness allowed us to predict two different fates for these populations
   regarding ongoing global warming.},

Title = {Combined Effects of Climate Change and Bank Stabilization on Shallow
   Water Habitats of Chinook Salmon},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1201-1211},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Significant challenges remain in the ability to estimate habitat change
   under the combined effects of natural variability, climate change, and
   human activity. We examined anticipated effects on shallow water over
   low-sloped beaches to these combined effects in the lower Willamette
   River, Oregon, an area highly altered by development. A proposal to
   stabilize some shoreline with large rocks (riprap) would alter shallow
   water areas, an important habitat for threatened Chinook salmon
   (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and would be subject to U.S. Endangered
   Species Act-mandated oversight. In the mainstem, subyearling Chinook
   salmon appear to preferentially occupy these areas, which fluctuate with
   river stages. We estimated effects with a geospatial model and
   projections of future river flows. Recent (1999-2009) median river
   stages during peak subyearling occupancy (April-June) maximized beach
   shallow water area in the lower mainstem. Upstream shallow water area
   was maximized at lower river stages than have occurred recently. Higher
   river stages in April-June, resulting from increased flows predicted for
   the 2080s, decreased beach shallow water area 17-32\%. On the basis of
   projected 2080s flows, more than 15\% of beach shallow water area was
   displaced by the riprap. Beach shallow water area lost to riprap
   represented up to 1.6\% of the total from the mouth to 12.9 km upstream.
   Reductions in shallow water area could restrict salmon feeding, resting,
   and refuge from predators and potentially reduce opportunities for the
   expression of the full range of life-history strategies. Although
   climate change analyses provided useful information, detailed analyses
   are prohibitive at the project scale for the multitude of small projects
   reviewed annually. The benefits of our approach to resource managers
   include a wider geographic context for reviewing similar small projects
   in concert with climate change, an approach to analyze cumulative
   effects of similar actions, and estimation of the actions' long-term
   effects.},

Title = {Predicting the cumulative effect of multiple disturbances on seagrass
   connectivity},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7},
Pages = {3093-3104},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The rate of exchange, or connectivity, among populations effects their
   ability to recover after disturbance events. However, there is limited
   information on the extent to which populations are connected or how
   multiple disturbances affect connectivity, especially in coastal and
   marine ecosystems. We used network analysis and the outputs of a
   biophysical model to measure potential functional connectivity and
   predict the impact of multiple disturbances on seagrasses in the central
   Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), Australia. The seagrass
   networks were densely connected, indicating that seagrasses are
   resilient to the random loss of meadows. Our analysis identified
   discrete meadows that are important sources of seagrass propagules and
   that serve as stepping stones connecting various different parts of the
   network. Several of these meadows were close to urban areas or ports and
   likely to be at risk from coastal development. Deep water meadows were
   highly connected to coastal meadows and may function as a refuge, but
   only for non-foundation species. We evaluated changes to the structure
   and functioning of the seagrass networks when one or more discrete
   meadows were removed due to multiple disturbance events. The scale of
   disturbance required to disconnect the seagrass networks into two or
   more components was on average >245km, about half the length of the
   metapopulation. The densely connected seagrass meadows of the central
   GBRWHA are not limited by the supply of propagules; therefore,
   management should focus on improving environmental conditions that
   support natural seagrass recruitment and recovery processes. Our study
   provides a new framework for assessing the impact of global change on
   the connectivity and persistence of coastal and marine ecosystems.
   Without this knowledge, management actions, including coastal
   restoration, may prove unnecessary and be unsuccessful.},

Volume = {52},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Testing restoration methods is essential for the development of
   restoration ecology as a science. It is also important to monitor a
   range of taxa, not just plants which have been the traditional focus of
   restoration ecology. Here, we compare the effects on ground flora and
   leaf-miners, of two restoration practices used when restoring conifer
   plantations. Two methods of restoration were investigated: clearfelling
   of plantations and the gradual thinning of conifers over time.
   Unrestored plantations and native broadleaved woodlands were also
   surveyed, these representing the starting point of restoration and the
   reference community, respectively. The study sites consist of two forest
   types (acidic Quercus woodland and mesotrophic Fraxinus woodland)
   enabling us to compare the two restoration methods in different habitat
   types. We use a well-replicated, large-scale study system consisting of
   32 woodland plots, each 2ha in size. There were 179 plant species
   identified in the plots. Clearfelled plots had greater overall ground
   flora species richness than other management regimes (thinned,
   unrestored plantation and native woodland), but the richness of woodland
   plant species did not differ between clearfelled, thinned, native
   woodland and unrestored plantation plots. More than 10000 leaf-miners
   comprising 122 species were collected. Increased plant species richness
   was associated with increased leaf-miner species richness under all
   management regimes except clearfelled plots. Forest type did not affect
   the response to restoration method; that is, there was no interaction
   between management regime and forest type for any of the variables
   measured.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that both the
   clearfelling and gradual thinning approaches to plantation restoration
   maintain woodland ground flora species. Either method can be used
   without detriment to woodland ground flora species richness. However,
   these methods differed in their effects on the leaf-miner-plant species
   richness relationship. If increasing invertebrate herbivore species
   richness is a concern, the gradual thinning approach is more
   appropriate.

Abstract = {Factors that influence the composition and diversity of soil nematode
   communities on oceanic islands are poorly understood. In this study, we
   evaluated the soil nematode communities and associated biotic and
   abiotic factors on five oceanic islands in the north of the South China
   Sea. We detected 38 nematode genera and found that bacterivores and
   fungivores were the dominant trophic groups, representing 54.2-70.4\%
   and 15.1-35.3\%, respectively, of total soil nematode abundance. The
   abundances of total soil nematodes and of all trophic groups, maturity,
   structure indices and nematode diversity were positively correlated with
   island latitude and area, and were negatively correlated with soil total
   K and annual temperature. In addition, the abundances of total soil
   nematodes, bacterivores, herbivores and nematode dominance index were
   positively associated with soil available K. The abundances of total
   soil nematodes, fungivores, herbivores, predators and omnivores,
   maturity, structure, Shannon diversity indices were positively related
   to soil moisture. Variation partitioning analysis showed that the
   combination of soil properties and climatic-geographical factors
   explained more of the variation (26.8-61.5\%). The results suggest that
   larger island can maintain greater nematode diversity than smaller
   islands due to the greater diversity of habitats on larger island. The
   key climatic-geographical and edaphic factors affecting soil nematode
   communities were latitude, annual temperature, soil moisture and total
   K, respectively},

Abstract = {Understanding relationships between centrality to life and the Theory of
   Planned Behavior (TPB) may provide further insight on wildlife-related
   behaviors, as the literature suggests both have effects on behavioral
   intentions. Using a survey (n = 219) of participants at musk ox safaris
   in Dovrefjell Norway, we investigated relationships between centrality
   to life and TPB, as well as musk ox safari participation's perceived
   effects on intentions to perform three pro-environmental behaviors.
   Relationships were analyzed using three partial least squares structural
   equation models (PLS-SEM) that had R-2 values of .46, .49, and .47,
   indicating satisfactory predictive validity. Centrality to life was
   related to two of TPB's dimensions: attitudes and subjective norms.
   Furthermore, centrality was associated with intentions to perform all
   three pro-environmental behaviors. We concluded that short-duration
   wildlife watching activities based on a single species can be positively
   related to participants' intentions, and centrality can add further
   insight to the TPB.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Unsanctioned life is often categorised as `feral', a value-embedded term
   that orders non-humans in relation to various temporal-spatial, genetic
   or behavioural logics. Such labelling is frequently used to marginalise
   risky, undesirable life and allow space for strategies of control and
   regulation. Feral natures, however, might also be understood as an
   important, though frequently ignored, form of rewilding situated where
   strategies of conservation and biosecurity converge. Using the example
   of (re)introduced wild boar (Sus scrofa) in England as `feral rewilding'
   in action, this paper considers how the politics around their presence
   are contested by actors who hold different understandings of wild boar
   and human-nonhuman relations more broadly. After a multi-century
   absence, over the last three decades farmed wild boar have escaped and
   been deliberately released, occasionally establishing autonomous and
   self-sustaining populations. This is most visible in the Forest of Dean
   where their unfamiliar presence has increasingly reconfigured social
   relations. Being categorised as `feral' as a strategy of governance is a
   contributing factor to a fraught political landscape where wild boar
   belonging is constantly questioned.},

Title = {Apex predators decline after an influx of pastoralists in former Central
   African Republic hunting zones},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {241},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Pastoralism is spreading in Central Africa, where many protected areas
   are under consideration to be opened for grazing, in particular hunting
   zones. Here we document the loss of biodiversity followed by an influx
   of transhumant pastoralism into previously uninhabited and virtually
   pristine habitat in the Central African Republic. Our track count and
   camera trap surveys of 2012, 2016 and 2017 evidence a reduction of apex
   predators, particularly Northern lions (Panthera leo leo) and African
   wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), of which about 95\% and 80\% were lost,
   respectively. While some large herbivores such as Western African
   buffalo (Syncerus caller nanus) or Eastern giant eland (Tragelaphus
   derbianus gigas) were also strongly reduced, most herbivores remain at
   significant densities. Apex predator populations did thus not crash due
   to a lack of prey, but rather due to targeted killing by herders and
   accompanying merchants, as interviews confirmed. Our call-up survey
   suggests that lions were attracted by livestock outside of actively
   protected areas, were they got poisoned or shot. These findings
   exemplify the potential negative effects of pastoralism on wildlife even
   in large areas with intact habitat. We thus caution against the
   transformation of protected areas or hunting zones into pasture land,
   unless such a land-use change can be carefully managed and strictly
   controlled.},

Title = {Designing the landscape of coexistence: Integrating risk avoidance,
   habitat selection and functional connectivity to inform large carnivore
   conservation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {235},
Pages = {178-188},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Large carnivores often inhabit human-dominated landscapes, where
   avoidance of anthropogenic risks can constrain their use of space and
   time. Large carnivore conservation thus requires designing landscapes of
   coexistence, which should provide suitable habitats and dispersal
   opportunities in areas shared with humans. This study investigates the
   landscape of coexistence for the Iberian wolf, using movement data from
   15 individuals to model how human-related risks constrain the spatial
   distribution of habitats and functional connectivity in highly modified
   landscapes. Wolves avoided potential sources of human disturbance,
   particularly settlements, roads, trails and windfarms. Avoidance was
   generally stronger for residents than dispersers, and in daytime than in
   twilight and night. There was strong elevational segregation,
   particularly at night, with higher and lower elevations selected by
   residents and dispersers, respectively. Conductance surfaces indicated
   that resident wolves were largely restricted to fragmented mountainous
   areas less used by people, while they faced strong resistance to
   movement in more densely populated lowlands. Higher tolerance to humans
   facilitated the movement of dispersers through the landscape, though
   they had the additional constraint of avoiding resident wolves. There
   were well-defined dispersal corridors potentially connecting most wolf
   packs. Our results reinforce the need to prevent new sources of human
   disturbance such roads and wind farms in remnant areas used by resident
   wolves, and to preserve continuous dispersal corridors through areas
   heavily used by humans. More generally, designing landscapes of
   coexistence should target at facilitating the spatial and temporal
   segregation of human structures and activities from large carnivore
   breeding and dispersal habitats.},

Title = {Forest conversion to cattle ranching differentially affects taxonomic

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {210},
Number = {A},
Pages = {343-348},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Understanding the effects of land conversion for livestock grazing on
   species diversity and functional groups continues to be urgently needed
   to assess how ranching affects animal assemblages and provide guidelines
   for managing landscapes under this omnipresent type of land use. Given
   Neotropical bats' high diversity of feeding habits and flying abilities,
   and that they play multiple, important ecological roles in ecosystems,
   they are an ideal study system to address such a need. We investigated
   the effects of livestock ranching on Neotropical bat species and
   functional groups composition via meta-analyses of published
   information. We used the odds-ratio metric to compare the frequency of
   occurrence of bat species in old-growth forest vs. areas influenced by
   livestock. Our results show no effects when considering bats as a group.
   However, significant effects emerge when they are assessed separately,
   on the basis of taxonomic family, feeding habit, conservation status and
   flying ability, showing that considering bats as a black box mutes
   relevant patterns. Molossid and phyllostomid species with high movement
   ability or omnivorous habit showed an increased frequency in livestock
   areas. In contrast, frugivores and aerial insectivores with low movement
   ability, carnivores, gleaning insectivores, nectarivores, sanguivores
   and species considered under some degree of extinction risk were
   significantly more frequent in old growth forest. Overall, our results
   support that areas converted for livestock production retain only a
   subset of the Neotropical bat functional diversity while most of the
   functional groups are negatively impacted. Such heterogeneity of
   responses seems critical for our understanding of the effects of land
   use change on animal communities.},

Title = {Wolves can suppress goodwill for leopards: Patterns of human-predator
   coexistence in northeastern Iran},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {213},
Number = {A},
Pages = {210-217},

Abstract = {Mammalian carnivores often cause problems for people by preying on
   domestic stock. Exploring the factors that affect people's attitudes to
   predators, in particular the circumstances when some degree of loss is
   tolerated, is needed for developing predator management plans. When more
   than one species of predator is involved, there may be unexpected
   interactive effects in shaping people's tolerance. We addressed this
   hypothesis in a west Asian multi-predator montane landscape with high
   density of both wild ungulates and livestock harboring two large
   predators, Persian leopard and grey wolf. A semi-structured
   questionnaire survey of herders residing around Tandoureh, Salouk and
   Sarigol National Parks, northeastern Iran was carried out. The perceived
   role of leopards in depredation was negligible compared with that of
   wolves which were reported to be more frequent stock raiders and
   responsible for an average of 5.7 times more annual losses per herd by
   than were leopards. Non predatory causes of mortality, particularly
   diseases, were clearly the major threat to livestock. Interviewed
   herders showed different attitudes toward each predator. Regardless of
   any recent occurrence of stock raiding by wolves, they were
   predominantly considered negatively. Although people showed mainly
   positive attitudes toward leopards, respondents who reported more wolf
   attacks tended to have more negative attitudes toward leopards. Hence,
   in multiple predator ecosystems, peoples' attitudes toward each species
   may be affected by the perceived activity of other predators. Often
   neglected in conservation programs, this phenomenon is clearly important
   in sustaining people tolerance particularly if endangered large
   predators are involved.},

Abstract = {The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an iconic Australian species that
   is currently undergoing a number of threatening processes, including
   disease and habitat loss. A thorough understanding of population genetic
   structuring and genomic variability of this species is essential to
   effectively manage populations across the species range. Using a reduced
   representation genome sequencing method known as double digest
   restriction-associated sequencing, this study has provided the first
   genome-wide SNP marker panel in the koala. In this study, 33,019 loci
   were identified in the koala and a filtered panel of 3060 high-utility
   SNP markers, including 95 sex-linked markers, were used to provide key
   insights into population variability and genomic variation in 171 koalas
   from eight populations across their geographic range. Broad-scale
   genetic differentiation between geographically separated populations
   (including sub-species) was assessed and revealed significant
   differentiation between all populations (F-ST range = 0.01-0.28), with
   the largest divergence observed between the three geographically distant
   subgroups (QLD, NSW and VIC) along the east coast of Australia (average
   F-ST range = 0.17-0.23). Sub-group divergence appears to be a reflection
   of an isolation by distance effect and sampling strategy rather than
   true evidence of sub-speciation. This is further supported by low
   proportions of AMOVA variation between sub-species groups (11.19 \%).
   Fine-scale analysis using genome-wide SNP loci and the NETVIEW pipeline
   revealed cryptic genetic sub-structuring within localised geographic
   regions, which corresponded to the hierarchical mating system of the
   species. High levels of genome-wide SNP heterozygosity were observed
   amongst all populations (He = 0.25-0.35), and when evaluating across the
   species to other vertebrate taxa were amongst the highest values
   observed. This illustrates that the species as a whole still retains
   high levels of diversity which is comparable to other outbred vertebrate
   taxa for genome-wide SNPs. Insights into the potential for adaptive
   variation in the koala were also gained using outlier analysis of
   genome-wide SNPs. A total of 10 putative outlier SNPs were identified
   indicating the high likelihood of local adaptations within populations
   and regions. This is the first use of genome-wide markers to assess
   population differentiation at a broad-scale in the koala and the first
   time that sex-linked SNPs have been identified in this species. The
   application of this novel genomic resource to populations across the
   species range will provide in-depth information allowing informed
   conservation priorities and management plans for in situ koalas across
   Australia and ex situ around the world.},

Title = {Rapid condition monitoring of an endangered marine vertebrate using
   precise, non-invasive morphometrics},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {242},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding causes of population change is critical for conservation.
   Quantifying these causes can be difficult, especially for hard to sample
   animals like marine vertebrates (e.g. pinnipeds). One solution is to
   investigate spatiotemporal differences in a species' body condition by
   measuring body size and mass. Collecting traditional morphological
   measurements is risky and labour intensive, making less invasive and
   more efficient techniques desirable. Using Australian sea lions
   (Neophoca cinerea) of known size and mass as a case study, we tested the
   suitability of using drone-derived photogrammetry to estimate
   morphological measurements and assess body condition. Drone-derived
   measurements were precise and without bias. Animal mass was highly
   correlated with the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional measurements of
   simplified area and volume, explaining > 77\% and > 84\% (all P < .01)
   of the variation in mass, depending on the age-sex class. The juvenile
   class exhibited the strongest associations (both 2D and 3D R-2 > 0.99).
   Using each measurement as a proxy for mass, we calculated body condition
   indices for each class by standardising the variables by animal length.
   Photogrammetric indices ranked individuals comparably to those generated
   from ground-collected data (r(s) = 0.77-1, depending on age-sex class).
   Our technique provides a workflow for the non-invasive collection of
   morphometric data to quantify animal condition, which is transferrable
   to other pinniped species with species-specific calibration. It will
   also facilitate the efficient collection of morphometric data of
   vertebrates from remotely sensed imagery.},

Title = {Conservation of severely fragmented populations: lessons from the
   transformation of uncoordinated reintroductions of cheetahs (Acinonyx
   jubatus) into a managed metapopulation with self-sustained growth},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {13},
Pages = {3393-3423},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We document and evaluate the use of metapopulation management to
   conserve a declining population of 217 cheetahs in 40 subpopulations.
   Metapopulation management resembles a natural metapopulation, but
   dispersal success, demographic rescue effects and genetic viability are
   enhanced by moving suitable individuals to selected habitat fragments.
   Unfortunately, history and results of metapopulation management are
   rarely published. Cheetahs, extirpated from 85\% of South Africa, were
   reintroduced from Namibian and South African ranches into fenced
   reserves. During 1965-2009 343 cheetahs were reintroduced, yet reserves
   held only 289 in 2009. Then translocations of free-roaming cheetahs were
   halted, and numbers dropped to 217 on 40 reserves by 2012. A
   metapopulation project was launched, and key conservation problems
   indentified from interviews and records. Thirty-five percent of reserves
   had no breeding cheetahs, 13\% were inbreeding, fence quality was
   erratic, 3\% of cheetahs were sold into captivity annually, and 28\% of
   cheetah mortalities were anthropogenic. Lions accounted for 31\% of
   mortality, perhaps elevated by lion-inexperienced cheetahs and high lion
   densities. These problems were addressed, and cheetahs were translocated
   between reserves. Although the median reserve size was only 125km(2)
   holding four cheetahs, and 80\% of reserves were privately owned, in
   6years the metapopulation grew by 51\% to 328 cheetahs on 51 reserves,
   while genetic diversity was managed and monitored. Thus, using
   metapopulation management, low density species and associated key
   processes, including carnivory or mega-herbivory, can be conserved in
   relatively small reserves in regions withdensehuman populations
   precluding natural gene flow.},

Title = {Normalized difference vegetation index, temperature and age affect
   faecal thyroid hormone concentrations in free-ranging African elephants},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 4},
Abstract = {Conservation biologists can use hormone measurements to assess animals'
   welfare, reproductive state, susceptibility to stressors, as well as
   energy expenditure. Quantifying hormone concentrations from faecal
   samples is particularly advantageous as samples can be collected without
   disturbing animals' behaviour. In order for an endocrine marker to be
   useful for wildlife managers, we need to understand how extrinsic and
   intrinsic factors affect hormone concentrations in free-ranging animal
   populations. Thyroid hormones are linked to basal metabolic rate and
   energy expenditure. Previous research demonstrated that triiodothyronine
   (T3) can be measured successfully in faecal matter of African elephants,
   Loxodonta africana. However, to our knowledge, research into factors
   affecting changes in elephant T3 levels has only been carried out in
   captive elephants so far. Thus, we present the first study of faecal T3
   metabolite (mT3) concentrations of a large population of free-ranging
   African elephants. Over 15 months, we collected faecal samples from
   identified (n=43 samples) and unidentified (n=145 samples) individuals
   in Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa. We investigated whether
   vegetative productivity {[}normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI)] in interaction with mean monthly temperature, age and sex
   affected mT3 concentrations. We found a significant negative interaction
   effect of NDVI and temperature. Increasing NDVI was related to higher
   concentrations of mT3, but increasing temperature was related to a
   decrease in mT3 concentrations in individually identified and
   unidentified elephants. In unidentified individuals, juvenile elephants
   had significantly higher mT3 concentrations compared to adult elephants.
   Faecal T3 can successfully be quantified in samples from free-ranging
   elephant populations and thus provides insight into energy expenditure
   in large herbivores.},

Title = {Exploring the implications of recreational disturbance on an endangered

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {22},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1783-1798},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Site and wildlife managers globally are under increasing pressure to
   implement management strategies that address the negative implications
   of outdoor recreational activities on wildlife. For many rare and
   isolated species any anthropogenic activities that cause disturbance
   could potentially be detrimental to existing populations. Understanding
   how non-consumptive recreation can influence a species may therefore be
   critical to its preservation. We developed a novel approach to
   specifically address this need. Using a combination of field surveys and
   simulation modelling exercises, we (1) explored the responses of
   endangered Karner blue butterflies (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) to
   recreation, (2) assessed whether such responses influenced oviposition
   rate and/or host plant choice and (3) tested alternative management
   strategies that could alleviate the negative impacts of recreation. Our
   field surveys confirmed that Karner blues were sensitive to recreational
   disturbance. Butterflies flushed at similar speeds and distances from
   recreationists (2.2 m at 0.17 m/s), as they would from natural threats,
   such as predators (2.2 m at 0.19 m/s). Incorporating female response
   parameters into a simulation model revealed that regular disturbance
   could reduce egg laying potential and significantly restrict host plant
   choice, which in turn, could impact the butterfly's population dynamics.
   However, we established that it was possible to effectively offset the
   implications of recreational disturbance using our simulation modelling
   approach. For example, extending Karner blue breeding habitat from
   trails and other public rights of way has the potential to alleviate
   such disturbance. Our study demonstrates that the potential impact of
   recreation on species of conservation concern should not be overlooked.},

Abstract = {Collisions between traffic and wildlife can have population-level

   science-based discussion of mitigation measures to reduce lethal
   vessel-strikes in this region. To determine the viability of different
   mitigation actions we studied Bryde's whale behavior with suction-cup
   attached tags. Tagged whales (n = 7, 62.5 h) spent 91\% of their time at
   depths within the maximum draft of vessels transiting the Gulf,
   increasing the probability of vessel-strike. Whales are broadly
   distributed throughout the Gulf so re-routing traffic would not lessen
   the threat of vessel-strike. Monitoring whales visually is difficult and
   not applicable at night, when whales rested closer to the surface than
   during the day. Passive acoustic monitoring is unreliable due to the
   whales' low vocal activity and because low frequency calls are
   susceptible to masking from vessel noise. These findings resulted in a
   Transit Protocol for Shipping including voluntary speed restrictions and
   a monitoring plan, highlighting the value of scientific and social
   stakeholders working together for conservation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Applying the precautionary principle to the issue of impacts by pet cats
   on urban wildlife},

Abstract = {Despite evidence that pet cats prey on urban wildlife and may transmit
   disease, there is uncertainty over whether they cause declines in
   wildlife populations. The uncertainty fosters disagreement about whether
   and how pet cats should be managed, and hampers the implementation of
   regulations. We suggest that the precautionary principle could be used
   in this context. The principle mandates action to protect the
   environment when there is a scientifically plausible but unproven risk,
   and provides a rationale for immediate intervention to protect wildlife
   from pet cats while we await definitive studies. In applying a 4-step
   guide for implementing the precautionary principle, we argue that: (i)
   current data documenting wildlife mortality caused by pet cats satisfy
   the precautionary trigger of scientifically plausible risk; (ii) the
   risk of significant declines or local extinctions of threatened
   wildlife, coupled with uncertainty in establishing population declines
   in response to pet cats, argue for strong levels of precaution; (iii)
   precautionary measures that should be considered include, but are not
   limited to, restrictions on the maximum number of cats
   allowed/household, mandatory sterilisation and registration of pet cats,
   curfews, requiring pet cats roaming outdoors to wear collar-mounted
   predation-deterrents or compulsory confinement of cats to their owners'
   premises; and (iv) the principle's requirement for extensive
   consultation in implementing precautionary measures should encourage
   collaborations involving conservation biologists, veterinarians, animal
   welfare activists, concerned citizens and municipal officers. Adherence
   to these steps should assist in choosing actions that have broad support
   and are applicable to unique local circumstances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Understanding public perceptions and motivations around bear part use: A

   nationals},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {203},
Pages = {282-289},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The trade in bear bile and other bear parts in Southeast Asia and China
   is a leading driver in the decline of Asian bear populations, and is a
   serious conservation challenge. Currently consumption of bear parts is
   unsustainable, and could lead to the extinction of some bear species in
   the wild. Reducing demand for such products is at the core of strategies
   to conserve species involved in illegal wildlife trade. A better
   understanding of the attitudinal, cultural and economic mechanisms
   behind bear bile consumption behaviors would inform more effective
   education and awareness efforts towards changing these socioeconomic
   variables. Using surveys, we conducted a preliminary investigation in
   northern Laos of Chinese tourists in Laos (n = 401) and Lao (n = 887)
   respondents' use of bear bile and bear parts, as well as differences in
   attitudes, value orientations, and knowledge between these two groups.
   Our results indicate that the availability of the product leads to
   greater reliance, as seen in our survey results of the Chinese
   respondents. Lao respondents, though less reliant, were more likely to
   prefer wild bear bile. Chinese tourists appeared to be more
   knowledgeable about bear conservation, versus Lao respondents. In
   general, we note substantial differences in attitudes, behaviors, and
   knowledge of bear part consumption between Lao and Chinese respondents.
   Based on these results, we advise the integration of educational
   programs with other strategies throughout Southeast Asia to increase
   understanding of the linkage between the decline in bear populations and
   the use of bear bile and other bear parts, thereby reducing demand. (C)

Title = {Identifying potential gray wolf habitat and connectivity in the eastern
   USA},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {273},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Following federal protection in 1974, gray wolves (Canis lupus)
   partially recolonized former range in the western Great Lakes region,
   USA, yet remain absent from most of the eastern USA. Understanding
   potential for further recolonization requires quantifying remaining wolf
   habitat and habitat connectivity. We used recent snow tracking data from
   the western Great Lakes region to create an ensemble distribution model
   to estimate areas of habitat large enough to support gray wolf
   populations in the eastern USA. We then modeled cost-weighted distances
   between these areas and circuit connectivity to identify potential
   linkages. Our final distribution model had good performance (Receiver
   Operator Characteristic = 0.87) and suggests wolves selected against
   areas with greater human population densities and proportions of
   agricultural land. Gray wolves currently occupy about 4 \% of their
   historical range in the eastern USA, which represents 12 \% of the area
   estimated to remain suitable. We estimated 35 \% of former range is
   currently suitable for wolves, and 18 \% of these suitable areas are
   protected, mostly under state and federal jurisdictions. We identified
   five unoccupied areas where wolves could establish viable populations
   ranging from 18,110 to 725,488 km(2). Connectivity between these areas
   and current wolf range is limited primarily by the Great Lakes and
   extensive agriculture in the Midwest USA. Most core habitat areas and
   priority linkages cross state or country borders, highlighting the
   importance of interjurisdictional cooperation. Our estimates of
   remaining suitable range and the potential for recolonization provide a
   baseline for the development of policies on gray wolf conservation in
   the eastern USA.},

Title = {Corridor use and streaking behavior by African elephants in relation to
   physiological state},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {167},
Pages = {276-282},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Wildlife populations occur in increasingly fragmented landscapes, making
   corridor ecology important to conservation managers. Human disturbance
   has been identified as a proximate cause of limiting corridor use or
   increasing streaking behavior by wild elephants, but there are likely to
   be physiological triggers that directly initiate these risk averse
   behaviors. We simultaneously monitored elephant stress hormone
   concentrations and movement in two reserves to test whether elephants in
   an elevated physiological state restricted use of corridors, or, if they
   still used corridors, exhibited relatively rapid unidirectional
   movements indicative of streaking behavior. Contrary to predictions, the
   elephant population in an elevated physiological state did not reduce
   use of corridors between core areas. However, as predicted, when the
   population was in an elevated physiological state, elephant family
   groups exhibited less tortuosity, and moved 77\% faster when in
   corridors as opposed to core areas, compared to only a 20\% difference
   between corridor and core area speed when not in an elevated
   physiological state. Rapid movement along corridors by elephants in
   elevated physiological states is likely an adaptive behavioral response
   to avoid further exposure to stressors. Furthermore, because chronically
   stressed elephants can be more aggressive towards humans, understanding
   when and where elephants exhibit streaking behavior can guide
   human-elephant conflict mitigation. We demonstrate that corridor use can
   exist at relatively fine spatial scales within fenced reserves, and the
   persistent use of corridors regardless of physiological state suggests
   that they are likely an important, but neglected, component of animal
   spatial ecology within reserves. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Pathways to improve park-people relationships: Gendered attitude changes
   in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, Myanmar},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {216},
Pages = {78-85},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The relationships that local residents have with protected areas present
   many challenges for protected area management. The objective of this
   paper is to explore the gendered impact of a protected area management
   strategy on communities around Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary in central
   Myanmar. Based on a survey that captured local people's attitudes toward
   the sanctuary, the warden modified the management strategy to
   accommodate local needs and perceptions. When the survey was repeated
   four years later, people were significantly more likely to like the
   sanctuary, less likely to mention problems, and more likely to mention
   benefits. Disaggregating changes by gender revealed that women's and
   men's perceptions changed in different ways. Women's perceptions
   primarily improved through an increase in positive perceptions, such as
   conservation and ecosystem service benefits, while men's perceptions
   improved primarily through a decrease in negative perceptions, such as
   problems with extraction and protected area management. In other words,
   women's attitudes were improved through increasing their understanding
   of the positive benefits of conservation while men's attitudes improved
   through mitigating the conflict aspects. Our results align with research
   in other fields that has found that positive messaging has more impact
   on women while problem-solving resonates more with men. These results
   indicate that the promotion of protected area benefits and the
   mitigation of park-people conflicts can be distinct pathways for
   improving people's attitudes toward protected areas. More broadly, these
   results suggest that protected area managers should consider how
   management impact different groups and tailor outreach messages for
   different groups.},

Title = {Costs and Benefits of the Presence of Leopards to the Sport-Hunting
   Industry and Local Communities in Niassa National Reserve, Mozambique},

Abstract = {Sport hunting is often proposed as a tool to support the conservation of
   large carnivores. However, it is challenging to provide tangible
   economic benefits from this activity as an incentive for local people to
   conserve carnivores. We assessed economic gains from sport hunting and
   poaching of leopards (Panthera pardus), costs of leopard depredation of
   livestock, and attitudes of people toward leopards in Niassa National
   Reserve, Mozambique. We sent questionnaires to hunting concessionaires
   (n = 8) to investigate the economic value of and the relative importance
   of leopards relative to other key trophy-hunted species. We asked
   villagers (n = 158) the number of and prices for leopards poached in the
   reserve and the number of goats depredated by leopard. Leopards were the
   mainstay of the hunting industry; a single animal was worth
   approximately U.S.\$24,000. Most safari revenues are retained at
   national and international levels, but poached leopard are illegally
   traded locally for small amounts (\$83). Leopards depredated 11 goats
   over 2 years in 2 of 4 surveyed villages resulting in losses of \$440 to
   6 households. People in these households had negative attitudes toward
   leopards. Although leopard sport hunting generates larger gross revenues
   than poaching, illegal hunting provides higher economic benefits for
   households involved in the activity. Sport-hunting revenues did not
   compensate for the economic losses of livestock at the household level.
   On the basis of our results, we propose that poaching be reduced by
   increasing the costs of apprehension and that the economic benefits from
   leopard sport hunting be used to improve community livelihoods and
   provide incentives not to poach.},

Abstract = {The impact of hunting on wildlife is a complex phenomenon which varies
   in space and across time, and yet limited knowledge is available on it.
   This is especially the case of the indirect effects of hunting on the
   behaviour of target as well as non-target species. Here we analyze how
   hunting affected the spatial behaviour of 62 radiocollared roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus) in a protected area adjacent to areas where
   hunting with hounds (target species: wild boar and hares) and stalking
   with rifles from high seats without dogs (target species: roe deer) were
   permitted during the hunting season. Our results showed that hunting
   caused a significant increase in the home range size of monitored deer,
   as well as a ``reserve effect{''}, whereby roe deer used the protected
   area as a refuge from hunters. These behavioural responses were
   significant only at times when hunting with hounds was conducted, even
   though roe deer was not the target species of this technique. Reactions
   to the perceived risk of predation varied among age and sex classes,
   with yearling being more sensitive and using the protected area more
   than adults. As shown in our study, hunting harassment provoked by
   drives with hounds significantly affects the behaviour of non-target
   species. Therefore, the use of long-legged hounds represents a variable
   that should be carefully evaluated by wildlife managers in their
   management plans and conservation policies, especially when endangered
   or vulnerable species are present. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Prioritizing highway defragmentation locations for restoring landscape

Year = {2014},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {157-164},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Transport infrastructures are a major driver of global landscape change.
   In many areas, highways were built before environmental impact
   assessments required the implementation of wildlife crossing structures.
   A fundamental task in the development of ecological networks is
   identifying areas where dispersal pathways of vulnerable populations may
   be blocked or affected by high volume roads. Financial considerations
   may limit investment, thus it is vital to establish the relative
   contribution of each road defragmentation location to upholding habitat
   connectivity and availability. In this paper, recent methodological
   developments in habitat network analysis, derived from the probability
   of connectivity index, were refined and used to evaluate the role of
   each highway defragmentation location in restoring landscape
   connectivity. The forest protected area network in the Basque country
   (northern Spain) was selected as an illustrative case study. The
   proposed approach was able to quantify and effectively account for a
   combination of factors determining the contribution of each highway
   defragmentation location to upholding connectivity, which are rarely
   jointly considered in analyses oriented to support restoration decisions
   in landscapes affected by the barrier effect of transport
   infrastructures. The contribution to connectivity of each
   defragmentation location depended on its topological position in the
   landscape, on the relative decrease in the effective distance among
   habitat areas that results from the permeability restoration at that
   location, on the distance from the defragmentation location to other
   alternative wildlife crossing structures already existing in the
   landscape, on the amount of habitat in the areas connected by the
   linkages that run through the defragmentation location and on the
   dispersal abilities of the focal species.},

Title = {Effects of urbanisation and landscape heterogeneity mediated by feeding

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1063-1077},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although the impacts of urbanisation on biodiversity are well studied,
   the precise response of some invertebrate groups remains poorly known.
   Dung-associated beetles are little studied in an urban context,
   especially in temperate regions. We considered how landscape
   heterogeneity, assessed at three spatial scales (250, 500 and 1000 m
   radius), mediates the community composition of coprophilous beetles on a
   broad urban gradient. Beetles were sampled using simple dung-baited
   traps, placed at 48 sites stratified across three distance bands around
   a large urban centre in England. The most urban sites hosted the lowest
   abundance of saprophagous beetles, with a lower mean body length
   relative to the least urban sites. Predicted overall species richness
   and the richness of saprophagous species were also lowest at the most
   urban sites. Ordination analyses followed by variation partitioning
   revealed that landscape heterogeneity across the urban gradient
   explained a small but significant proportion of community composition.
   Heterogeneity data for a 500-m radius around each site provided the best
   fit with beetle community data. Larger saprophagous species were
   associated with lower amounts of manmade surface and improved grassland.
   Some individual species, particularly predators, appeared to be
   positively associated with urban or urban fringe sites. This study is
   probably the first to examine the response of the whole coprophilous
   beetle community to urbanisation. Our results suggest that the response
   of this community to urbanisation matches expectations based on other
   taxonomic groups, whilst emphasising the complex nature of this
   response, with some smaller-bodied species potentially benefitting from
   urbanisation.},

Title = {Continued decline in genetic diversity among wild cheetahs (Acinonyx
   jubatus) without further loss of semen quality},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {200},
Pages = {192-199},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As a well-studied felid with limited genetic diversity, the cheetah
   (Acinonyx jubatus) has shaped much of the scientific debate surrounding
   inbreeding depression. The species survived a population bottleneck
   similar to 12,000 years ago and was extirpated from >75\% of its
   historical range in the last century. Modem cheetahs produce
   poor-quality semen, a presumed manifestation of inbreeding depression.
   Within Felidae, a positive association between genetic diversity and
   semen quality is well supported by pedigree data and inter-species
   comparisons. However, this relationship has never been examined among
   individual cheetahs. Furthermore, whether ongoing population declines
   are exacerbating inbreeding depression in wild or captive cheetah
   populations is unknown. Using 12 microsatellite markers, we evaluated
   the relationship between heterozygosity and reproductive traits among
   wild (n = 54) and captive (n = 43) male cheetahs born from 1976-2007. We
   tested the hypotheses that genetic diversity has declined over the last
   similar to 30 years and is positively correlated with semen
   quality/breeding success in the cheetah. Findings revealed that genetic
   diversity has, decreased in the wild, but not captive, population.
   Unexpectedly, heterozygosity was lower in proven versus unproven
   breeders and did not correlate with semen quality. A small proportion of
   all males (<10\%) produced relatively high quality ejaculates, with
   sperm traits similar to those of non-inbred felid species. These data
   suggest a more complex relationship between inbreeding and male cheetah
   reproductive traits than previously appreciated. Intensive management of
   captive cheetahs appears to be minimizing inbreeding, whereas the
   continued erosion of genetic diversity in wild males is of conservation
   concern. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Using livestock to manage plant composition: A meta-analysis of grazing
   in California Mediterranean grasslands},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {300-308},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The use of livestock to manage vegetation composition has become a
   common element of conservation planning in many regions of the world.
   Similar to many arid and semi-arid grasslands throughout the world,
   California grasslands have a history of invasion by non-native grasses
   and forbs. Attempts to restore native plant populations using managed
   grazing are common, despite the lack of an overarching quantitative
   basis for assessing livestock effects on different plant groups. Given
   the wide range of soils, climate and topography over which grasslands
   are found, it is important to understand the context-dependency of
   grazing effects across a region. We performed a meta-analysis of
   livestock grazing within California grasslands to investigate the
   response of different plant groups to grazing relative to precipitation,
   grassland type, soil and grazing regime. We found that exotic forbs
   showed a dramatic, uniform increase in cover with grazing, but no
   increase in richness. By contrast, native forbs increased in richness
   yet their cover response was weak and variable depending on grazing
   regime and precipitation. Exotic grass cover was unaffected while
   richness was enhanced by grazing. Native grass cover generally increased
   with grazing, although the high variation among studies was not
   predicted by the explanatory variables we evaluated. These results lend
   support to the use of grazing to enhance native forb richness and native
   grass cover in some settings although this must be weighed against
   increases in the cover of exotic forbs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Assessing California's bar-built estuaries using the California Rapid
   Assessment Method},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {300-310},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Bar-built estuaries are generally found at the mouths of smaller
   watersheds with seasonal precipitation, episodic streamflow and seasonal
   swell dynamics. Low streamflows and constructive wave forces form a sand
   bar at the mouth isolating the stream from the ocean, creating a ponded
   lagoon, and inundating the surrounding marsh plain. Bar-built estuaries
   are wide spread in California comprising over 50 percent of California's
   more than 500 estuaries. By connecting terrestrial, freshwater, and
   marine realms bar-built estuaries are complex and dynamic providing
   great habitat and ecosystem services. California has suffered some of
   the highest losses of wetland habitats, and the wetland habitats of
   bar-built estuaries continue to be threatened by further development,
   pollution, and climate related changes including diminished streamflows
   and sea level rise. Given this loss and threat we developed a California
   Rapid Assessment Method (CRAM) to assess the condition of California's
   bar-built estuaries. CRAM uses visual indicators to accurately reflect
   current wetland condition with regards to buffer habitat, hydrology,
   physical complexity, plant diversity and structure, and landscape
   influences. Here we validate this method by comparing results of CRAM
   for bar-built estuaries to other accepted measures of wetland condition
   that we simultaneously collected with CRAM including vegetative surveys,
   water nutrient levels, and GIS landscape scale measures of stress for 32
   sites throughout California. CRAM correlated well with each of these
   three independent methods of assessing condition. Notably, the
   Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) number of natives
   metric significantly correlated with CRAM Index and all Attribute
   scores. The strong correlations of CRAM to nutrient levels is
   particularly important considering the documentation of the negative
   impact of nutrients on fish populations, the use of bar-built estuaries
   by juveniles of commercially important species, and the nursery role of
   bar-built estuaries for maintaining imperiled populations of species
   such as steelhead. GIS measured percent impervious, percent agriculture,
   and percent dams all correlated well with expected CRAM Attribute scores
   at appropriate watershed scales relative to the area of inference for
   each CRAM metric. Further, CRAM for bar-built estuaries works well
   throughout California's diversity of environmental conditions and
   regardless of geography, timing, or whether the bar was open or closed
   during the survey. We hope that the availability of CRAM combined with
   available data repositories will enable local, state, and federal
   decision makers to better manage, restore, and conserve valuable
   bar-built estuaries in the face of continual threats like development,
   drought, and sea level rise. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Linking habitat use to mortality and population viability to disarm an
   ecological trap},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {236},
Pages = {366-374},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Animal excursions out of protected areas are a source of human-wildlife
   conflict and can lead animals into ecological traps. These arise when
   animals prefer areas of their habitat conferring lower fitness than
   other available areas. Ecological traps should become increasingly
   common as humans continue to alter habitats, yet their impact on
   population viability has rarely been documented and there is limited
   knowledge on how to disarm them. Moreover, although spatial factors such
   as the proportion of trap habitat in the landscape are crucial in
   determining the probability of extinction, few studies have attempted to
   link animal use of space to demography to obtain insights into how to
   release trapped populations. Here we tackle these gaps using a
   stochastic, spatially explicit matrix model parametrized with empirical
   data. We show that a free-ranging population of plains bison (Bison
   bison bison) caught in an ecological trap caused by legal but
   unregulated hunting has a 66\% probability of extinction over the next
   50 years under current conditions. By linking the time bison spent in
   fields with hunting permission to survival and population persistence,
   we show that bison use of such fields must decrease by 70\% to ensure
   population viability. Our approach narrowed down the ecological trap to
   < 1\% of the population's range during the hunting period. Targeting
   this limited portion of the landscape would hence be a cost-effective
   strategy to disarm the trap. We show that a spatially explicit approach
   to demography can refine conservation strategies to avoid potentially
   onerous and ineffective interventions.},

Title = {Implications of flood disturbance for conservation and management of
   giant panda habitat in human-modified landscapes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {232},
Pages = {35-42},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As certain extreme weather events are becoming frequent and intense,
   conservationists must identify areas across species' ranges recurrently
   affected, especially with regard to threatened species. Focusing on the
   giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and historical flood frequency
   distribution, we determined overlaps between panda distribution affected
   by floods and nature reserves. We also examined the correspondence
   between areas subject to high flood exposure densities, areas with high
   panda habitat use, and areas that exhibit high human density. Of the 67
   reserves established for giant panda conservation 7 included areas with
   the highest flood exposure densities while having a mean exposure
   ranging between 20 and 75\%. In Sichuan province up to 32\% of areas of
   high habitat use were subject to low flood density, and 10\% overlapped
   with areas subject to high flood density. We also found that 40\% of the
   total area with high human density was subject to a high flood density.
   Our findings indicate that high frequency of flooding is affecting areas
   of nature reserves where people are rather than areas which pandas are
   using more intensively. In areas occupied by pandas, strategies should
   remain focus on mitigating habitat degradation and fragmentation caused
   by human activities that can also reduce habitat resilience to floods.
   Management aimed at reducing vulnerability and enhancing resilience in
   flood-prone areas is warranted if we are to prevent negative indirect
   impacts on panda habitat driven by human responses to increasingly
   frequent and intense extreme weather events in the coming decades.},

   Western Ghats protected areas},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {166},
Pages = {175-185},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Preventing and mitigating human-wildlife conflicts are a top
   conservation priority, particularly in India where wildlife and high
   densities of people co-occur. We surveyed 1972 households from 1371
   villages in a 7449-km(2) area surrounding five reserves in the Western
   Ghats. Our observational study modeled self-reported crop and livestock
   loss and compensation access by households. Crop loss was reported by
   64\% of households and associated with growing cotton, sugarcane, coffee
   and rice. Livestock loss was reported by 15\% of households, and
   associated with grazing animals inside reserves. Losses incurred by
   households varied across reserves, averaging INR Rs 23,010 for crop loss
   and Rs 5423 for livestock loss. Compensation receipt was reported by
   31\% of households, and associated with reporting loss to authorities
   and elephant related incidents. Overall, landscape estimated probability
   of crop loss was 0.91, livestock loss was 0.19 and compensation was
   0.29. Common mitigation measures for crop protection were night watching
   (46\%), fencing (34\%) and scare devices (34\%); and for livestock
   protection were closer watch on animals (7\%), guard animals (3\%) and
   fencing (2\%). Among 13 reported mitigation measures, no individual
   measure appeared to be associated with lowering crop or livestock loss.
   Unexpectedly, reported losses were similar across all reserves with
   higher losses incurred by households closer to the reserves. We
   identified conflict hot spots and influential factors across five
   reserves to improve current management efforts directed at conflict
   prevention and mitigation, and this approach is extendable to other
   human-dominated wildlife rich landscapes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Anthropogenic activity and structures have varying effects on the

Abstract = {While protected areas are often considered strongholds for wildlife
   populations, recent research in protected areas has highlighted that
   both human activity (i.e. presence) and footprint (i.e. structures) can
   influence wildlife. To determine how human activity and structures
   affect the spatiotemporal activity of wildlife on the Apostle Islands
   National Lakeshore, Wisconsin, United States, we monitored the carnivore
   community for 5 years (2014-2018) using camera traps. We found that
   lighthouses had a negative impact on carnivore community richness, while
   historical sites had a positive impact. Responses of individual
   carnivore species to anthropogenic structures varied depending on
   structure type, with most of the canids and mustelids exhibiting
   negative associations with campgrounds. When examining the seasonal
   effects of human activity and footprint (i.e., when park visitation is
   relatively high or low), we found that carnivore richness was lower
   during the high human activity season, suggesting that seasonal
   variation in human activity influences carnivore activity. We also
   compared carnivore nocturnality along a gradient of anthropogenic
   activity, but our results indicate that the carnivore community did not
   become more nocturnal with increasing anthropogenic activity as
   expected. However, the carnivore community did display spatial avoidance
   of current anthropogenic structures, especially campgrounds. Our study
   indicates that human footprint in the form of structures and seasonal
   variation in human activity can influence wildlife activity within
   protected areas. Based on this study, species-specific research that
   includes multiple representations of potential human effects (i.e.,
   including categories of human footprint and activity) will allow for a
   more nuanced and cohesive understanding of the impacts of humans on the
   spatial and temporal distributions of wildlife species.},

Title = {Dung beetle richness is positively affected by the density of wild

Abstract = {Dung beetles are a functionally important group of species, and the
   effects of large wild herbivores on these species are not well
   understood. Management of wild herbivores could, therefore, have
   considerable consequences for dung beetle assemblages and the ecosystem
   services they provide. Here, we analysed how species richness, biomass,
   abundance, and composition of dung beetle assemblages were affected by
   different dung availability as a consequence of different red deer
   (Cervus elaphus) densities under field conditions. This was done in
   spring and autumn over four independent study regions in Central Europe
   where red deer are the most important providers of dung in forests. Our
   results show that forest sites with high dung availability support
   higher species richness of dung beetles than sites with low
   availability. This effect is independent of season and could be
   explained by the different colonisation patterns of beetle species which
   vary in their competitiveness. As aggregated dung resources increase
   opportunities for low-competitive species, those species establish small
   populations and do not necessarily increase the abundance of the whole
   assemblage. Our results show that the current policies to limit deer
   populations also limit higher levels of species diversity of this
   functionally important arthropod taxon. We highlight the importance of
   hunting-free areas for the conservation of insect diversity associated
   with large herbivores. In strictly protected areas with low herbivore
   densities we suggest to reduce control of ungulate numbers to provide
   sufficient resources for maintaining dung beetle diversity.},

Title = {Models for the collaborative management of Africa's protected areas},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {218},
Pages = {73-82},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Africa's protected areas (PAs) are under severe and growing
   anthropogenic pressure. Resources for PA management are a small fraction
   of what is necessary in most countries, and many PM are failing to
   fulfil their ecological, economic or social potential as a result.
   Collaborative management partnerships (CMPs), where nonprofit
   organisations partner with state wildlife authorities, have the ability
   to improve PA management by facilitating long-term financial and
   technical support. While many have demonstrated success, there are
   barriers to setting up CMPs, including concern among some states that
   some partnerships may undermine sovereignty or appear an admission of
   failure. We interviewed 69 experts from state and non-profit partners
   about 43 PAs covering 473,861 km(2) in 16 African countries and analysed
   responses with principle component analysis to identify how partnerships
   differ, particularly in how they allocate governance and management
   responsibility. We identified three main CMP organisational structures:
   1) delegated management, where a non-profit shares governance
   responsibility with the state and is delegated full management
   authority; 2) co-management, where a non-profit shares governance and
   management responsibility with the state; and 3) financial and technical
   support (advisory or implementary), where a non-profit assists the state
   with aspects of management without formal decision-making authority.
   Delegated models were associated with higher funding than co-management
   and financial-technical support partnerships, but models did not differ
   in PA land area size. Our study identifies the strengths and weaknesses
   of each model and offers recommendations for implementing successful
   CMPs, many of which are already playing a significant, positive role in
   conservation.},

Title = {SAGEBRUSH, GREATER SAGE-GROUSE, AND THE OCCURRENCE AND IMPORTANCE OF
   FORBS},
Journal = {WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {76},
Number = {3},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) ecosystems provide habitat
   for sagebrush-obligate wildlife species such as the Greater Sage-Grouse
   (Centrocercus urophasianus). The understory of big sagebrush plant
   communities is composed of grasses and forbs that are important sources
   of cover and food for wildlife. The grass component is well described in
   the literature, but the composition, abundance, and habitat role of
   forbs in these communities is largely unknown. Our objective was to
   synthesize information about forbs and their importance to Greater
   Sage-Grouse diets and habitats, how rangeland management practices
   affect forbs, and how forbs respond to changes in temperature and
   precipitation. We also sought to identify research gaps and needs
   concerning forbs in big sagebrush plant communities. We searched for
   relevant literature including journal articles and state and federal
   agency reports. Our results indicated that in the spring and summer,
   Greater Sage-Grouse diets consist of forbs (particularly species in the
   Asteraceae family), arthropods, and lesser amounts of sagebrush. The
   diets transition to sagebrush in fall and winter. Forbs provide cover
   for Greater Sage-Grouse individuals at their lekking, nesting, and
   brood-rearing sites, and the species has a positive relationship with
   arthropod presence. The effect of grazing on native forbs may be
   compounded by invasion of nonnative species and differs depending on
   grazing intensity. The effect of fire on forbs varies greatly and may
   depend on time elapsed since burning. In addition, chemical and
   mechanical treatments affect annual and perennial forbs differently.
   Temperature and precipitation influence forb phenology, biomass, and
   abundance differently among species. Our review identified several
   uncertainties and research needs about forbs in big sagebrush
   ecosystems. First, in many cases the literature about forbs is reported
   only at the genus or functional type level. Second, information about
   forb composition and abundance near lekking sites is limited, despite
   the fact that lekking sites are an important center of Greater
   Sage-Grouse activity. Third, there is little published literature on the
   relationship between forbs and precipitation and between forbs and
   temperature, thereby limiting our ability to understand potential
   responses of forbs to climate change. While there is wide agreement
   among Greater Sage-Grouse biologists that forbs are an important habitat
   component, our knowledge about the distribution and environmental
   responses of forb species in big sagebrush plant communities is limited.
   Our work for the first time synthesizes the current knowledge regarding
   forbs in sagebrush ecosystems and their importance for Greater
   Sage-Grouse and identifies additional research needs for effective
   conservation and management.},

Title = {Orangutan killing and trade in Indonesia: Wildlife crime, enforcement,
   and deterrence patterns},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {276},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Wildlife poaching and illegal trade threaten the survival of many rare
   species. We assessed spatiotemporal patterns in illegal killing, injury,
   capture, possession, and sale of orangutans, as well as law enforcement
   efforts, and conservation interventions affecting Critically Endangered
   orangutans in Indonesia from 2007 to 2019 using data collected from
   published and unpublished sources. We found 2229 reported crimes during
   the study period, including killing and non-lethal crimes. Annual crime
   rates did not show a declining trend overall during the study period.
   Most crimes, 99.6 \% for Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), and 95.7
   \% for Sumatran (P. abelii) and Tapanuli (P. tapanuliensis) orangutans
   combined, involved local not international trade. A total of 22 court
   cases (0.9 \%) related to 2229 reported crimes; 20 of these cases led to
   convictions. At expected detection rates of less than 10 \%, average
   estimated species mortality from killing was 14.3 \% for Tapanuli and
   Sumatran orangutans combined, and 5.1 \% for Bornean orangutans. This
   exceeds the 1-2 \% orangutan hunting mortality threshold expected to
   drive populations to extinction. National parks with orangutans had
   0.28-2.11 enforce-ment officers per 100 km2, below the 3-11 officers per
   100 km2 considered global best practice to deter poaching. The most
   prevalent interventions to address orangutan crime-education and
   handovers of illegally held animals-have been conducted without an
   associated decline in crimes. These tactics alone are insufficient to
   address orangutan-related crimes. Substantial increases in patrols,
   investigations, arrests, and convictions, as well as community-focused
   solutions are urgently needed to halt orangutan killing and trade.},

Title = {Eurasian lynx habitat selection in human-modified landscape in Norway:
   Effects of different human habitat modifications and behavioral states},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {191},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Eurasian lynx are often regarded as being particularly sensitive to
   human land-use. However, in the European context where human influence
   is pervasive, the conservation of lynx requires that they be integrated
   into the human-dominated landscape. Although previous studies have
   looked at how lynx respond to human land-use in a broad sense, they have
   failed to examine the details of how different types of human induced
   impacts (forest fragmentation, human density, different types of
   transport infrastructure) influence distinct lynx behaviors.
   Furthermore, they have not examined the extent to which lynx modify
   their fine scaled avoidance behavior of anthropogenic landscape features
   according to the specific behaviors (resting sites, kill sites,
   movement) in which they are engaged and how these relationships are
   modified by prey density or the sex of the lynx. We used Resource
   Selection Functions to examine how 19 GPS-marked lynx in southeastern
   Norway responded to an index of cumulative human habitat modification
   while engaged in different activities. We found that lynx select for
   areas with medium levels of human modification, avoiding both the very
   highly modified and the areas with low degrees of modification. Females
   in general appear to be less tolerant of human modification than males,
   especially when it comes to resting sites. Terrain (ruggedness and
   elevation) appears to be important in permitting lynx to exploit heavily
   modified areas. Our study demonstrates that lynx show a nuanced response
   to human habitat modification, which offers hope for their conservation
   in Europe. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Insurance may encourage coexistence between farmers and wildlife by
   reimbursing farmers' losses. China introduced an insurance scheme to
   mitigate human-elephant conflict in Xishuangbanna Dai autonomous
   prefecture in Yunnan Province, where elephants cause damage to rubber
   plantations. However, recent experience has suggested that the present
   insurance system exhibits poor performance related to funding
   shortfalls, undervaluing of plantations and insufficient payouts, and by
   limiting community involvement. To address these shortcomings we
   conducted attitude surveys with farmers, and developed an actuarial
   (risk-based) insurance model for rubber loss that incorporated
   spatially-explicit risk of depredation and net present value of rubber
   at damage, in order to calculate fair payouts at village and town levels
   for the year 2011. Farmers were largely dissatisfied with the current
   insurance system, and their level of satisfaction was associated with
   the compensation ratio (percentage of lost rubber reimbursed by
   insurance). The illustrative results based on 2011 rubber loss data
   revealed high variability in risk and therefore payouts (and further,
   premiums) and that fair insurance payouts would be approximately five
   times the current levels. To improve compensation and support long-term
   program sustainability, we considered an insurance cost-sharing
   mechanism that incorporated shared payments from government, rubber
   farmers, and Chinese tourists. We found that multiple stakeholders were
   willing to pay for elephant conservation, which could make significant
   contributions to insurance premiums over the long term. Importantly,
   this proposed insurance model could be broadly applicable to livestock
   and long-lived cash crop compensation systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {An isolated population of the fisher (Martes pennanti) in the southern
   Sierra Nevada, California, is threatened by small size and habitat
   alteration from wildfires, fuels management, and other factors. We
   assessed the population's status and conservation options for its
   habitat using a spatially explicit population model coupled with a
   fisher probability of occurrence model. The fisher occurrence model was
   selected from a family of generalized additive models (GAM) generated
   using numerous environmental variables and fisher detection-nondetection
   data collected at 228 survey arrays sampled repeatedly during 2002-2006.
   The selected GAM accounted for 69\% of the Akaike weight using total
   above-ground biomass of trees, latitude-adjusted elevation, and annual
   precipitation averaged over a 5 km(2) moving window. We estimated
   equilibrium population sizes (or carrying capacities) within currently
   occupied areas, and identified likely population source, sink, and
   expansion areas, by simulating population processes for 20 years using
   different demographic rates, dispersal distances, and territory sizes.
   The population model assumed that demographic parameters of fishers
   scale in proportion to habitat quality as indexed by the calculated
   probability of fisher occurrence. Based on the most defensible range of
   parameter values, we estimate fisher carrying capacity at similar to
   125-250 adults in currently occupied areas. Population expansion into
   potential habitat in and north of Yosemite National Park has potential
   to increase population size, but this potential for expansion is
   predicted to be highly sensitive to mortality rates, which may be
   elevated in the northern portion of the occupied range by human
   influences, including roadkill and diseases carried by domestic cats and
   dogs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Wildlife tourism is a growing industry, with significant conservation
   and socio-economic benefits. Concerns have however been raised about the
   possible impacts of this industry on the long-term behaviour, health and
   fitness of the animal species tourists come to see (the target species),
   particularly when those species are regularly fed to improve the tourism
   experience. Information on the contribution of food rewards to the diet
   of the target species at feeding sites is critical to assess the
   dependency on handouts and to identify possible health/fitness problems
   that might be associated, if handouts become the main part of animals'
   diets. Here, we use stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to
   evaluate the importance of handouts for a marine predator, the bull
   shark (Carcharhinus leucas), at a feeding site (Fiji) where shark feeds
   occur 5 days/week and sharks (up to 75 individuals/dive) are fed similar
   to 200 kg of tuna heads/day. There was no evidence of incorporation of
   food provided, even for individuals that regularly consume food rewards.
   Results, when combined with those from previous studies on bull shark
   movements and feeding rates at our study site, show that current levels
   of provisioning likely have no long-term impacts on bull shark diet or
   behaviour. This study also demonstrates the applicability of stable
   isotope analysis to assess and monitor the contribution of food rewards
   to wildlife, and highlights the benefits of using multi-sources of
   information to gain a holistic understanding of the effects of
   provisioning predators.},

Title = {Genetic rescue: A critique of the evidence supports maximizing genetic
   diversity rather than minimizing the introduction of putatively harmful
   genetic variation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {251},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Genetic rescue - ameliorating inbreeding depression and restoring
   genetic diversity of inbred populations through gene flow - is valuable
   in wildlife conservation. Empirically validated recommendations for
   genetic rescue supported by evolutionary genetics theory advise
   maximizing genetic diversity in target populations. Instead, recent
   papers based on genomic studies of island foxes, Isle Royal wolves, and
   simulation modeling claim it would be preferable to minimize
   introduction of harmful variation by avoiding genetic rescue altogether
   or by selecting partially-inbred sources presumed to have fewer harmful
   alleles. We examined the assertions and evidence underlying these new
   recommendations. The claim that long-term persistence of a few small
   inbred populations invalidates the small population paradigm commits the
   survivorship fallacy by ignoring population extinctions through
   inbreeding. The claim that island foxes show no inbreeding depression
   conflicts with elevated levels of putatively harmful alleles, low
   fecundity, and island-specific disease susceptibilities. The claim that
   the history of Isle Royale wolves represents likely outcomes of genetic
   rescues using immigrants from larger source populations is invalid: the
   unplanned addition of a single male to an inbred population capped at
   similar to 25 individuals does not represent sound genetic rescue. The
   simulations in Robinson et al. (2018, 2019) and Kyriazis et al. (2019
   pre-print) apply several unrealistic assumptions and parameter
   distributions that disfavor large, outbred sources for genetic rescue.
   Accordingly, the simulations' conclusions conflict profoundly with those
   of > 120 meta-analysed real datasets, and do not overturn current
   empirically validated recommendations to maximize genetic diversity in
   the target population.},

Title = {Assessing the impact of climate change on the spatio-temporal
   distribution of foot-and-mouth disease risk for elephants},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and are important
   for maintaining regional ecosystem balance and community diversity.
   However, poaching, population growth, habitat fragmentation, and viruses
   are major threats to global elephant populations. Foot-and-mouth disease
   (FMD) is one of the major threats to the health of elephants. Global
   warming has a serious impact on wildlife and accelerates the spread of
   viruses. In this study, the effects of climate change on the risk of
   disease in elephants were evaluated based on 1833 sites with reported
   FMD cases. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) was used to model the current and
   future geographic distributions of FMD and to assess the risk of FMD in
   elephants under climate change. The results showed that the average
   annual temperature and annual precipitation were higher in elephant
   habitats than in the range of the FMD virus. The mean temperature in the
   driest quarter, temperature seasonality, annual mean temperature, and
   precipitation in the driest month had relatively large contributions to
   the risk of FMD, with a cumulative contribution rate of 82.8\%. Both
   Asian elephants and African elephants had high overlap with the FMD
   virus with respect to altitude, annual mean temperature, and annual
   precipitation. An overall high risk of disease was detected at a certain
   band, mainly concentrated from 10 degrees N to 50 degrees N in the
   northern hemisphere and from 10 degrees S to 35 degrees S in the
   southern hemisphere. The risk of FMD was higher for the Asian elephant
   than the African elephant. The FMD risk increased gradually from the
   southeast to northwest in habitats of the Asian elephant, and presented
   a pattern of high northesouth risk and low intermediate risk in the
   habitats of the African elephant. The area proportions of high risk,
   medium risk, and low risk in the distribution of both the Asian elephant
   and African elephant were all higher than the proportions of all risk
   types worldwide. Under global warming, the FMD risk was not expected to
   change significantly in most of the habitat areas of the Asian elephant
   or the African elephant in the 2050s and 2070s. Moreover, the areas and
   proportions of high risk, medium risk, and low risk were likely to
   change slightly. These results could benefit the conservation of
   elephants and provide relevant data for the prevention of FMD in
   high-risk areas under climate change. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published

Title = {Use of macrofaunal assemblage indices and biological trait analysis to
   assess the ecological impacts of coastal bivalve aquaculture},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {127},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Coastal bivalve aquaculture is considered to have large impacts on the
   structure and functions of macrofauna assemblages. In the present study,
   we evaluated the macrofauna assemblages from 12 bivalve farms along the
   China coast using 11 compositional and functional indices and 15
   biological traits within four major categories. Linear mixed models
   (LMMs) were used to identify the most influential variable on the
   selected indices. The RLQ and fourth-corner approaches were used to
   investigate the response of functional traits composition to the
   characteristics of bivalve farms. Our results suggest that the increased
   densities of cultured bivalve had a negative impact on the organisms
   sharing similar function traits but the ecosystem could still maintain
   the functional richness because those organisms were mainly on the
   redundant group, and their loss favored a more balanced distribution of
   taxa and biological traits. Additionally, biological trait compositions
   of macrofaunal assemblages were more similar within farms using the same
   culture method. Small-sized opportunistic deposit feeders were likely to
   appear in cage farms, and predators were more attracted by rope farms.
   In bottom-based bivalve farms, filter feeders dominated but carnivores
   and crawlers were significantly lower compared to the other culture
   methods. We conclude that functional redundancy is a critical indicator
   for identifying the suitable scale and intensity of bivalve aquaculture.
   From the perspective of maintaining biological traits, bottom-based
   culture causes less ecological impact compared to off-bottom culture,
   the latter is more suitable in areas with relatively deep water and
   strong current and water exchange rate.},

Title = {FRAGMATIC: in silico locus prediction and its utility in optimizing

Abstract = {Reduced-representation genomic methods are an invaluable data
   acquisition tool for conservation geneticists, yet a priori estimates of
   locus recovery are difficult for non-model organisms. We present a
   simple in silico approach (FRAGMATIC) that predicts locus recovery in
   ddRAD sequencing which utilizes genomic data for related organisms. Its
   applicability was tested by quantifying prediction accuracy versus
   genetic distances across five non-model organisms and reference genomes
   for related organisms of varying phylogenetic distance. We additionally
   examined sensitivity of the method using one organism (Danio rerio) with
   an available genome. FRAGMATIC supports population genomic projects in
   non-model species by providing a priori estimates of targeted ddRAD loci
   that, in turn, will curb wasted sequencing effort and optimize
   cost-efficiency. Validation shows that while predictive error is
   minimized when applied to a closely related reference genome, in silico
   estimates may also be robust to deeper (e.g. within-family)
   relationships, although weak correlation suggests that specific
   characteristics of genome architecture may be more predictive than
   genetic distance. This indicates that a more extensive exploration of
   genomes, including a broader taxonomic scope (e.g. beyond vertebrates),
   may be informative. All code is freely available at:

Journal = {CONSERVATION GENETICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {A certain level of genetic diversity and connectivity between
   populations is necessary to allow small populations to persist over
   time. In this study, we investigate the last two populations of the
   highly endangered Miami blue butterfly, one of which was extirpated in
   2010. We investigate whether an erosion of genetic diversity was the
   cause for the extirpation of the Bahia Honda State Park (BHSP)
   population. As the level of existing molecular diversity within and gene
   flow between the last two populations of the endangered Miami blue
   butterfly was unknown, we present data from twelve polymorphic
   microsatellite loci as an assessment. We show that greater genetic
   diversity (allelic richness and observed heterozygosity) than originally
   predicted existed in the BHSP population prior to its extirpation and
   values were even greater in the Key West National Wildlife Refuge
   population. Allelic frequencies show short-range gene flow between
   neighboring habitat patches and underline the importance of habitat
   connectivity. It does not appear that loss of genetic diversity was the
   cause for the loss of the BHSP population. Greater consideration of
   habitat connectivity should be considered for short and long-term
   conservation and management of this taxon.},

Title = {Using community-level metrics to monitor the effects of marine protected
   areas on biodiversity},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are used to protect species, communities,
   and their associated habitats, among other goals. Measuring MPA efficacy
   can be challenging, however, particularly when considering responses at
   the community level. We gathered 36 abundance and 14 biomass data sets
   on fish assemblages and used meta-analysis to evaluate the ability of 22
   distinct community diversity metrics to detect differences in community
   structure between MPAs and nearby control sites. We also considered the
   effects of 6 covariatesMPA size and age, MPA size and age interaction,
   latitude, total species richness, and level of protectionon each metric.
   Some common metrics, such as species richness and Shannon diversity, did
   not differ consistently between MPA and control sites, whereas other
   metrics, such as total abundance and biomass, were consistently
   different across studies. Metric responses derived from the biomass data
   sets were more consistent than those based on the abundance data sets,
   suggesting that community-level biomass differs more predictably than
   abundance between MPA and control sites. Covariate analyses indicated
   that level of protection, latitude, MPA size, and the interaction
   between MPA size and age affect metric performance. These results
   highlight a handful of metrics, several of which are little known, that
   could be used to meet the increasing demand for community-level
   indicators of MPA effectiveness.
   Uso de Medidas a Nivel de Comunidad para Monitorear los Efectos de las
   areas Marinas Protegidas sobre la Biodiversidad Las areas marinas
   protegidas (AMP) son usadas para proteger especies, comunidades y sus
   habitats asociados, ademas de tener otros objetivos. Sin embargo, medir
   la eficiencia de las AMP puede ser un reto, particularmente cuando se
   consideran las respuestas a nivel de comunidad. Reunimos conjuntos de
   datos sobre ensambles de peces, 36 conjuntos sobre abundancia y 14 sobre
   biomasa, y usamos un meta-analisis para evaluar la habilidad de
   deteccion de diferencias en la estructura de las comunidades entre las
   AMP y sitios cercanos de control de 22 medidas distintas de diversidad
   de comunidades. Tambien consideramos los efectos de seis covarianzas en
   cada medida - tamano y edad de la AMP, interaccion entre el tamano y la
   edad de la AMP, latitud, riqueza total de especies y nivel de
   proteccion. Algunas medidas comunes, como la riqueza de especies y la
   diversidad de Shannon, no difirieron consistentemente entre las AMP y
   los sitios de control, mientras que otras medidas, como la abundancia
   total y la biomasa, fueron diferentes de manera consistente en los
   estudios. Las respuestas de las medidas, derivadas de los conjuntos de
   datos sobre biomasa, fueron mas consistentes que aquellas basadas en los
   conjuntos de datos sobre abundancia, lo que sugiere que la biomasa a
   nivel de comunidad entre las AMP y los sitios de control difiere de
   manera mas predecible que la abundancia. Los analisis de covarianza
   indicaron que el nivel de proteccion, la latitud, el tamano de la AMP y
   la interaccion entre el tamano y la edad de la AMP afectan el desempeno
   de las medidas. Estos resultados resaltan a un punado de medidas, varias
   de las cuales son poco conocidas, que podrian usarse para satisfacer la
   demanda creciente de indicadores a nivel de comunidad de la efectividad
   de las AMP.

Abstract = {Shared values, public trust in an agency, and attitudes can influence
   support for successful conservation initiatives. To understand these
   relationships, this paper examines the role of social trust as a partial
   mediator between salient values similarity and attitudes toward wolves
   in south-western Alberta, Canada. Rural residents in this area face
   increasing wolf depredation on livestock. Data were obtained from a mail
   questionnaire (n = 566 respondents, response rate = 70\%) sent to rural
   residents in three municipal districts in south-western Alberta.
   Attitudes were predicted to directly influence behavioural intention to
   support or oppose wolf management. Most respondents held slightly
   similar values as the management agency and minimally trusted the agency
   to effectively manage wolves. As predicted, social trust in the agency
   served as a partial mediator between salient value similarity and
   attitudes toward wolves. Salient value similarity was also a strong
   predictor of attitudes toward wolves. Attitudes toward wolves predicted
   behavioural support. Thus, social trust of the management agency can
   influence attitudes and management preferences concerning a species.
   When dealing with human-wildlife conflict, social trust should be
   examined to understand the context of the problem.},

Abstract = {We describe use of Fort Collins, Colorado, and nearby areas by bats in
   2001-2005, and link patterns in bat ecology with concurrent public
   health surveillance for rabies. Our analyses are based on evaluation of
   summary statistics, and information-theoretic support for results of
   simple logistic regression. Based on captures in mist nets, the city bat
   fauna differed from that of the adjacent mountains, and was dominated by
   big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). Species, age, and sex composition of
   bats submitted for rabies testing locally and along the urbanizing Front
   Range Corridor were similar to those of the mist-net captures and
   reflected the annual cycle of reproduction and activity of big brown
   bats. Few submissions occurred November- March, when these bats
   hibernated elsewhere. In summer females roosted in buildings in colonies
   and dominated health samples; fledging of young corresponded to a summer
   peak in health submissions with no increase in rabies prevalence.
   Roosting ecology of big brown bats in buildings was similar to that
   reported for natural sites, including colony size, roost-switching
   behavior, fidelity to roosts in a small area, and attributes important
   for roost selection. Attrition in roosts occurred from structural
   modifications of buildings to exclude colonies by citizens, but without
   major effects on long-term bat reproduction or survival. Bats foraged in
   areas set aside for nature conservation. A pattern of lower diversity in
   urban bat communities with dominance by big brown bats may occur widely
   in the USA, and is consistent with national public health records for
   rabies surveillance.},

Title = {Positioning urban rivers within urban ecology},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {285-291},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Rivers are important components of many urban systems, and research into
   urban rivers is increasing internationally, both in scope and intensity.
   As an introduction to a special section on urban rivers, this short
   article briefly highlights some key trends in urban river research based
   on a survey of published articles from Web of Knowledge, before
   summarising the contributions made by the special section papers. In
   particular, there has been a general increase in work on urban rivers
   since the 1990s, with a more dramatic increase from 2001. Most published
   research has concentrated on water quality and its wider environmental
   implications; ecologically, many studies have focused on autecology,
   community ecology or river restoration/rehabilitation, with the main
   emphasis on macroinvertebrates or fish. Geographically, most studies
   have taken place in North America (mainly the US) and Asia (mainly
   China). In the large majority of cases research has been on relatively
   small rivers within urbanised catchments rather than large, heavily
   urbanised systems within major towns or cities. Given the wide range of
   topics and studies relating to urban river research, a detailed
   meta-analysis of the urban river ecology literature would be a useful
   endeavour. The six papers included in the special section of this issue
   provide a sample of some of key and emerging themes within recent urban
   river research, and originate from a session on the understanding and
   management of urban rivers held at the Royal Geographical Society (with
   IBG) Annual Meeting in 2010, at Imperial College London.},

Abstract = {Even in the presence of environmental safeguards, catastrophic accidents
   related to anthropogenic activities occur that can result in both
   immediate and chronic impacts on local biota. However, due to the
   unplanned nature of catastrophes, studies aimed to identify the effects
   of these accidents on an ecosystem and its inhabitants often have
   imperfect study designs that are reactive rather than proactive,
   resulting in methodological and analytical challenges. On 20 April 2010,
   following an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, a well blowout
   occurred on the seafloor approximately 80 km off the Louisiana coast in
   the Gulf of Mexico. This blowout resulted in the largest marine oil
   spill in United States history, which impacted critical migratory
   stopover and overwintering habitat for many seabird and shorebird
   species, including species of high conservation concern such as the
   piping plover (Charadrius melodus). Here, we assessed the potential
   longer-term demographic impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on
   piping plovers in a capture-mark-recapture framework. We examined
   whether a series of demographic processes, including probabilities of
   remaining at a specific wintering site, over-winter and annual apparent
   survival, winter stopover duration, and abundance varied among oiled and
   unoiled habitats. We found that the perceived amount of oiling on land,
   in water, and on individual birds, as well as numerous demographic
   processes, were spatially or temporally variable. However, we found
   little support that piping plover demography was negatively influenced
   by the magnitude of oil observed at an impacted area, or that
   demographic rates substantially varied between reference and oil
   impacted areas. Nor did we find that piping plovers that were observed
   to be oiled had lower survival probabilities following the DWH oil spill
   relative to non-oiled individuals from the same winter population.
   Although we did not find that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill
   substantially influenced piping plovers, our methods provide an
   analytical framework to more appropriately address both the near or
   long-term impacts of an anthropogenic disturbance on a species.},

Abstract = {Until about 20 years ago, sperm assessment in the laboratory was focused
   on motility, morphology and acrosomal integrity. Then came the gradual
   realisation that, because the main objective of a spermatozoon is to
   deliver an intact genetic payload of DNA to the egg, being able to check
   DNA quality of spermatozoa would be equally important, if not more so.
   Research over the last two decades has therefore led to the development
   of several techniques for reliably detecting DNA strand breaks, and the
   more recent focus has been directed towards understanding the fertility
   implications of DNA damage. It is now clear that evolutionary history
   has played an important role in determining the stability of sperm DNA
   under stressful conditions, and that the nature of the DNA-protein
   interactions also influence the extent to which fertility is affected by
   both technical procedures involved in sperm preservation and the basic
   biology of the species concerned. Here we present an overview of the
   principles involved in DNA assessment and also provide some cases
   studies that illustrate the influences of species diversity.},

Abstract = {Reliably identifying the species occupying an area is an essential part
   of any wildlife conservation study or sustainable management plan,
   especially when dealing with a harvested species such as deer.
   Traditional deer monitoring techniques such as faecal standing crop or
   faecal accumulation rate estimates cannot accurately identify deer
   species based on pellet morphology where more than one deer species is
   present. This study presents real-time PCR assays for the identification
   of fallow deer (Dama dama), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and sika deer
   (Cervus nippon) species from pellet samples, and real-time PCR sex
   determining assays to amplify the ZFX and SRY gene of all three deer
   species. These assays successfully identified tissue and faecal pellets
   of all three species with no cross species amplification. Sex
   determination was successful from both tissue and faecal pellets
   samples, with the assays amplifying as little as 4 pg of nDNA, making
   them suitable for use with the often poor quality and low quantity DNA
   found in noninvasive samples. Application of these assays will provide
   reliable species presence and distribution data not possible with
   traditional methods as well as valuable information on sex ratios which
   can inform sustainable wildlife management and harvest strategies.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Illegal hunters in Africa may be making rational decisions about the
   hunting activities they partake in. These decisions could be linked to
   their socioeconomic status and the livelihood opportunities available to
   them. In particular, poverty is widely considered the leading driver
   that causes a household's inhabitants to take up poaching in protected
   areas. Programs aiming to protect vulnerable wildlife populations by
   mitigating poaching have historically relied upon income-based poverty
   metrics in efforts to reduce regional poverty and incentivise local
   inhabitants to discontinue poaching activities. Because such data sets
   that deal with poachers directly are rare, assumptions about the role of
   poverty, and the extent of poverty, that drives poaching have been hard
   to test. This study uses a unique sample of 173 self-admitted poachers
   living in villages adjacent to Ruaha National Park in Tanzania to
   explore the influence of poverty on poaching. Results indicated high
   demographic and household economy heterogeneity among poaching
   households. Capability deprivation examined more subjective measures of
   poverty and revealed that poachers are strongly motivated by the need to
   improve their incomes, but are not necessarily the poorest of the poor.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Juema pig (Suina:Suidae), a rare, miniature and primitive species, has
   been living and razing on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau completely wild for
   thousands of years. Owing to the cold plateau climate, low energy, and
   low carbohydrate diet, Juema pig has some unique genetic characteristics
   that differentiate it from other pig breeds. If the species should not
   be protected in a timely manner, it would become extinct in the future.
   In June 2006, No. 662 announcement of the People's Republic ofChina has
   included the Tibetan pigs in the national protection list of poultry
   genetic resources. Developing reasonable conservation and utilization
   measures for Juema pig requires deeper understanding of molecular
   genetics. The complete mitochondrial genome of Juema pig was determined
   in this study. Similar to other vertebrate, the mitogenome is 16,690 bp
   in length and contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2
   ribosomal RNA genes and a D-loop region. The overall base composition of
   the H-strand is 34.76\% for A, 26.17\% for C, 13.24\% for G and 25.83\%
   for T. To ensure the sequence is reliable, phylogenetic tree was
   constructed using MEGA 6 with Neighbor-Joiningmethod (NJ) methods,
   demonstrating that Juema pig was clustered in subfamily Suina.},

Title = {Aquatic macroinvertebrates are poor indicators of agricultural activity
   in northern prairie pothole wetlands},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {81},
Pages = {333-339},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Northern Prairie Pothole Region (NPPR) of Alberta, Canada, contains
   numerous shallow marshes that serve as important habitat for wildlife
   and provide essential ecosystem services. Many of these wetlands have
   been destroyed or degraded by human activity and the majority of
   remaining wetlands occur in landscapes affected by crop and cattle
   production. Alberta has implemented a conservation policy which requires
   the creation of wetland assessment tools. Aquatic macroinvertebrates are
   frequently used as indicators of environmental condition in rivers, but
   their effectiveness as indicators in prairie pothole wetlands is not
   clear. To evaluate the capacity of aquatic macroinvertebrates identified
   to family-level resolution to serve as regional bioindicators of
   agricultural disturbance in NPPR wetlands, we sampled macroinvertebrates
   at 64 fishless wetlands. The wetlands spanned a gradient in the extent
   of agriculture from 0 to 100\% cover within a 500 m buffer around each
   wetland. We discovered that, contrary to our predictions,
   macroinvertebrate family richness and community composition could not
   predict agricultural disturbance (cropping or cattle grazing). We
   conclude that efforts to develop bioindicators for NPPR wetlands should
   be redirected to other taxa that are less costly to identify to species
   and that exhibit sensitivity to agricultural disturbance.},

Title = {Ethnomedicinal use of African pangolins by traditional medical
   practitioners in Sierra Leone},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Background: Pangolins (Manidae) have long been used for traditional
   medicinal purposes in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa. However, very
   little is known about the extent of this use, the body parts that are
   used and the ailments these practices are attempting to cure or
   alleviate. Pangolin body parts are used extensively and frequently by
   traditional medical practitioners in Sierra Leone.
   Methods: A total of 63 traditional medical practitioners consented and
   were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires on the traditional
   medicinal use of pangolin body parts. The use value, informant agreement
   ratio and use agreement value for each pangolin part was calculated to
   ascertain the most sought after body part, the level of knowledge
   dissemination among traditional medical practitioners about body parts
   and the most culturally significant body part.
   Results: It was found that 22 pangolin parts are used to treat various
   ailments and conditions under 17 international categories of diseases.
   The highest use value was recorded for scales while eyes had the highest
   level of consensus among the traditional medical practitioners. The
   highest use value and informant agreement ratio for scales were recorded
   for spiritual ailments. Scales were the most culturally significant body
   part according to the use agreement value.
   Conclusion: This study indicates a high importance value for pangolins
   as part of these communities' spiritual, cultural and medicinal beliefs.
   However, the numbers of individuals harvested from the wild remains
   unknown and unregulated even though pangolins have been listed under
   Schedule 2 of the Wildlife Conservation Act, 1972, of Sierra Leone,
   which prohibits any person from hunting or being in possession of
   pangolins. It is likely that this unregulated harvesting and poaching of
   this threatened species, for medicinal purposes, is unsustainable and
   there is an urgent need to determine pangolin population abundance
   within this region to ensure their sustainable harvesting for cultural
   use and conservation.},

Title = {A multi-state occupancy modelling framework for robust estimation of
   disease prevalence in multi-tissue disease systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Given the public health, economic and conservation implications of
   zoonotic diseases, their effective surveillance is of paramount
   importance. The traditional approach to estimating pathogen prevalence
   as the proportion of infected individuals in the population is biased
   because it fails to account for imperfect detection. A statistically
   robust way to reduce bias in prevalence estimates is to obtain repeated
   samples (or sample many tissues in multi-tissue disease systems) and to
   apply statistical methods that account for imperfect detection and
   permit the interdependence of the infection process across multiple
   tissues. We developed a multi-state occupancy modelling framework which
   considers two scenarios about the infection process, one where no
   assumptions about the dependencies among the tissues are made (general),
   and another where dependence among tissues is not permitted
   (constrained). We applied this framework to pseudorabies virus (PrV) DNA
   detection data obtained from whole blood; and oral, nasal and genital
   mucosa of 510 feral swineSus scrofaduring the years 2014-2016 in
   Florida, USA. The constrained model was better supported by data. PrV
   prevalence estimates varied among tissues and were higher than the naive
   estimates, ranging from to 0.06 (CI: 0.02-0.14) in genital to 0.54 (CI:
   0.14 - 0.82) in nasal tissue. Probability of PrV detection ranged from
   0.11 (CI: 0.06-0.18) in nasal to 0.51 (CI: 0.21-0.81) in genital tissue.
   PrV prevalence was not affected by the age or sex of the animal or the
   year of sampling, but prevalence increased as drought severity
   increased. The conditional probability of detecting PrV given infection
   in at least one tissue type within an individual was highest for nasal
   tissue, suggesting that nasal is the best tissue to sample for PrV
   surveillance if only one tissue can be sampled, at least for systems
   with tissue-specific prevalence and detection probabilities similar to
   ours. Synthesis and applications. We focused on inferences about
   pathogen prevalence in multi-tissue disease systems, dealing with both
   nondetection and potential dependencies among tissues in infection
   status. We found strong evidence of variation in both prevalence and
   detection probabilities among tissues. Our results emphasize the
   importance of sampling multiple tissues and of applying inference
   methods that account for imperfect detection in the surveillance of
   systemic diseases. The multi-state modelling framework is broadly
   applicable to the surveillance of pathogens that infect multiple tissues
   and can be used even when the infection status of the pathogen in one
   tissue may depend on the infection status of the pathogen in other
   tissue(s).},

Abstract = {Recent models indicate that coextinction events should be numerous but
   empirical support for coextinction is paradoxically scarce. I
   investigated whether the coextinction paradox is due to affiliates
   becoming extinct well ahead of their hosts, with the disjunction masking
   the coextinction event. Using psyllids (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) on
   acacias (Mimosaceae: Acacia) in southern Sydney as an example system, I
   compared the density of affiliate species and the proportion of
   specialists on threatened versus secure hosts. I observed reduced
   psyllid species densities on the threatened hosts Acacia pubescens and
   A. prominens relative to common, sympatric acacias, consistent with the
   loss of affiliates ahead of host plant extinction. However, contrary to
   predictions, I found no support for reduced affiliate specialisation on
   the threatened hosts. Rather, proximity to closely related hosts may be
   a stronger determinant of the proportion of specialised psyllid species
   on a host. In addition, generalists, as well as specialists, may be lost
   from declining plants due to loss of familiarity with rarely-encountered
   host plants.},

Title = {Group size mediates effects of intraspecific competition and forest
   structure on productivity in a recovering social woodpecker population},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},

Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {438-452},

Abstract = {Conservation of endangered social wildlife in disturbance-prone forests
   is challenging because direct and indirect effects of management
   strategies developed at the time of species' listing when population
   density is low may change under high-density conditions in locally
   recovered populations. Here, we used piecewise structural equation
   modeling to evaluate direct and indirect drivers of productivity in the
   federally endangered cooperatively breeding red-cockaded woodpecker
   Dryobates borealis (RCW) on Savannah River Site, South Carolina, USA. We
   estimated direct and indirect relationships among group size,
   neighboring group sizes, fledgling production, density of cavity tree
   clusters occupied by RCWs, area satisfying threshold criteria of >= 22
   stems ha(-1) of pines >= 35.6 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), <1.4
   m(2) ha(-1) basal area (BA) of hardwoods 7.6-22.9 cm dbh, and <6\%
   hardwood canopy cover, and area treated with prescribed fire, and tested
   whether group size mediated indirect effects of area satisfying
   threshold criteria on fledgling production. Increases in area with >= 22
   stems ha(-1) of pines >= 35.6 cm dbh and <1.4 m(2) ha(-1) BA of
   hardwoods 7.6-22.9 cm dbh, and area treated with prescribed fire, but
   not area with <6\% hardwood canopy cover, had direct positive effects on
   group size. Group size and area treated with prescribed fire, but not
   area satisfying threshold criteria, had direct positive effects on
   fledgling production. The direct effect of neighboring group sizes on
   fledgling production was negative and smaller relative to the direct
   positive effect of group size on fledgling production. Overall, our
   results indicate positive direct effects of group size on fledgling
   production outweighed negative direct effects of neighboring group
   sizes, and that group size mediated positive indirect effects of area
   satisfying structural threshold criteria on fledgling production. These
   findings indicate that ongoing forest management aimed to increase area
   with >= 22 pines ha(-1) >= 35.6 cm dbh and <1.4 m(2) ha(-1) BA of
   hardwoods 7.6-22.9 cm dbh will promote large group sizes, which in turn
   improve fledgling production and offset costs of heightened competition
   with neighboring groups under high-density conditions. Additionally,
   positive effects of area treated with prescribed fire on RCW group size
   and fledgling production indicate prescribed fire has unique
   contributions to woodpecker productivity, likely via direct effects on
   forest structure and potentially indirect effects on arthropod prey
   available to foraging RCWs. By simultaneously accounting for multiple
   drivers of productivity in social wildlife, our study contributes to the
   understanding of how increases in social wildlife population sizes can
   alter previously documented habitat-fitness relationships.},

Title = {Strategic Rat Control for Restoring Populations of Native Species in
   Forest Fragments},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {713-723},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Forest fragments have biodiversity value that may be enhanced through
   management such as control of non-native predators. However, such
   efforts may be ineffective, and research is needed to ensure that
   predator control is done strategically. We used Bayesian hierarchical
   modeling to estimate fragment-specific effects of experimental rat
   control on a native species targeted for recovery in a New Zealand
   pastoral landscape. The experiment was a modified BACI
   (before-after-control-impact) design conducted over 6 years in 19 forest
   fragments with low-density subpopulations of North Island Robins
   (Petroica longipes). The aim was to identify individual fragments that
   not only showed clear benefits of rat control, but also would have a
   high probability of subpopulation growth even if they were the only
   fragment managed. We collected data on fecundity, adult and juvenile
   survival, and juvenile emigration, and modeled the data in an integrated
   framework to estimate the expected annual growth rate () of each
   subpopulation with and without rat control. Without emigration,
   subpopulation growth was estimated as marginal ( = 0.95-1.05) or
   negative ( = 0.74-0.90) without rat control, but it was estimated as
   positive in all fragments ( = 1.4-2.1) if rats were controlled. This
   reflected a 150\% average increase in fecundity and 45\% average
   increase in adult female survival. The probability of a juvenile
   remaining in its natal fragment was 0.37 on average, but varied with
   fragment connectivity. With juvenile emigration added, 6 fragments were
   estimated to have a high (>0.8) probability of being self-sustaining ( >
   1) with rat control. The key factors affecting subpopulation growth
   rates under rat control were low connectivity and stock fencing because
   these factors were associated with lower juvenile emigration and higher
   fecundity, respectively. However, there was also substantial random
   variation in adult survival among fragments, illustrating the importance
   of hierarchical modeling for fragmentation studies. Control Estrategico
   de Ratas para Restaurar Poblaciones de Especies Nativas en Fragmentos de
   Bosque
   Resumen Los fragmentos de bosque tienen un valor de biodiversidad que
   puede mejorarse por medio del manejo, como el control de depredadores
   no-nativos. Sin embargo, dichos esfuerzos pueden no ser efectivos y se
   necesita investigar para asegurar que el control se realiza
   estrategicamente. Usamos modelos jerarquicos bayesianos para estimar los
   efectos especificos de fragmentos de un control de ratas sobre una
   especie nativa que se busca recuperar en un paisaje pastoral en Nueva
   Zelanda. El experimento fue un diseno ADCI
   (antes-despues-control-impacto) modificado conducido a lo largo de 6
   anos en 19 fragmentos de bosque con sub-poblaciones de baja densidad de
   petirrojos de North Island (Petroica longipes). El objetivo era
   identificar fragmentos individuales que no solo mostraran beneficios
   claros del control de ratas, sino tambien que tuvieran una alta
   probabilidad del crecimiento de sub-poblaciones aunque fuera el unico
   fragmento manejado. Recolectamos datos de fecundidad, supervivencia
   adulta y juvenil y emigracion juvenil, y modelamos los datos en un marco
   de trabajo integrado para estimar la tasa de crecimiento anual esperado
   () de cada sub-poblacion con y sin control de ratas. Sin emigracion, el
   crecimiento sub-poblacional se estimo como marginal ( = 0.95-1.05) o
   negativo ( = 0.74-0.90) sin control de ratas, pero se estimo como
   positivo en todos los fragmentos ( = 1.4-2.1) donde las ratas fueron
   controladas. Esto refleja un incremento promedio de 150\% en la
   fecundidad y de 45\% en la supervivencia de hembras adultas. La
   probabilidad de que un juvenil permanezca en su fragmento natal fue de
   0.37 en promedio, pero vario con la conectividad de los fragmentos. Al
   anadir la emigracion juvenil, se estimo que 6 fragmentos tenian una alta
   probabilidad (>0.8) de ser autosustentables ( > 1) con el control de
   ratas. Los factores clave que afectaron el crecimiento sub-poblacional
   bajo el control de ratas fueron la baja conectividad y el cercado, ya
   que estos factores se asociaron con una emigracion juvenil mas baja y
   una alta fecundidad respectivamente. Sin embargo, tambien hubo una
   variacion sustancial al azar en la supervivencia de adultos entre los
   fragmentos, ilustrando la importancia de los modelos jerarquicos para
   los estudios de fragmentacion.},

Title = {Is the raccoon (Procyon lotor) out of control in Europe?},

Abstract = {The northern raccoon (Procyon lotor) is an invasive species in Europe
   and poses a serious threat to indigenous biodiversity and human health.
   Raccoons can also cause important economic losses. Despite the risks, no
   comprehensive report on the raccoon status in Europe is available. In
   this article, I estimate the raccoon invaded range and population trends
   and evaluate the impacts on native ecosystems and wildlife to (1)
   determine the raccoon status and discuss the invasion process on a
   continental scale, (2) identify the threats, and (3) propose guidelines
   for designing management strategies for raccoon populations. Raccoons
   have been introduced in Europe since the late 1920s but raccoon
   population growth and range expansion rates have been increasing since
   1970s after a lag period. In addition, recent introductions through the
   pet trade have resulted in the establishment of new feral raccoon
   populations. Therefore, the raccoon spatial distribution is a result of
   multiple introductions and range expansion from the primary raccoon
   populations in central and eastern Europe over the last 40 years. First
   individuals escaped from fur farms or were released for hunting.
   Nowadays, the pet trade is the major introduction pathway. Raccoons have
   adapted to different environments, even urban and residential areas. In
   central Europe, the raccoon population has increased by over 300\% and
   grows at exponential rates since the 1990s. The raccoon is out of
   control in Europe because of increasing population trends, range
   expansion and no efficient management strategy. However, no impacts have
   still been reported through an evidence-based approach. There is a
   pressing need for a long-term management strategy of raccoon populations
   in Europe.},

Title = {Influence of a dynamic rearing environment on development of metabolic
   phenotypes in age-0 Lake Sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Environment-phenotype interactions are the most pronounced during early
   life stages and can strongly influence metabolism and ultimately
   ecological fitness. In the present study, we examined the effect of
   temperature {[}ambient river temperature (ART) vs ART+2 degrees C],
   dissolved oxygen (DO; 100\% vs 80\%) and substrate (presence vs absence)
   on standard metabolic rate, forced maximum metabolic rate and metabolic
   scope with Fulton's condition factor (K), energy density (ED) and
   critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in age-0 Lake Sturgeon, Acipenser
   fulvescens, before and after a simulated overwintering event. We found
   that all the environmental variables strongly influenced survival, K, ED
   and CT max. Fish reared in elevated temperature showed higher mortality
   and reduced K pre-winter at 127 days post-hatch (dph). Interestingly, we
   did not find any significant difference in terms of metabolic rate
   between treatments at both sampling points of pre- and post-winter.
   Long-term exposure to 80\% DO reduced ED in Lake Sturgeon post-winter at
   272 dph. Our data suggest that substrate should be removed at the onset
   of exogenous feeding to enhance the survival rate of age-0 Lake Sturgeon
   in the first year of life. Effects of early rearing environment during
   larval development on survival over winter are discussed with respect to
   successful recruitment of stock enhanced Lake Sturgeon, a species that
   is at risk throughout its natural range.},

Title = {Condition-dependent migratory behaviour of endangered Atlantic salmon
   smolts moving through an inland sea},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {The Bras d'Or Lake watershed of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada
   is a unique inland sea ecosystem, UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and home to a
   group of regionally distinct Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations.
   Recent population decreases in this region have raised concern about
   their long-term persistence. We used acoustic telemetry to track the
   migrations of juvenile salmon (smolts) from the Middle River into the
   Bras d'Or Lake and, subsequently, into the Atlantic Ocean. Roughly half
   of the tagged smolts transited the Bras d'Or Lakes to the Atlantic
   Ocean, using a migration route that took them through the Gulf of St
   Lawrence's northern exit at the Strait of Belle Isle (similar to 650 km
   from the home river) towards feeding areas in the Labrador Sea and
   Greenland. However, a significant fraction spent >70 days in the Lakes,
   suggesting that this population has an alternative resident form, in
   which smolts limit their migrations within the Bras d'Or. Smolts in good
   relative condition (as determined from length-to-mass relationships)
   tended to be residents, whereas fish in poorer condition were ocean
   migrants. We also found a covarying effect of river temperature that
   helped to predict residence vs. ocean migration. We discuss these
   results relative to their bioenergetic implications and provide
   suggestions for future studies aimed at the conservation of declining
   salmon populations in Canada.},

Title = {Patterns of herbivory-induced mortality of a dominant non-native
   tree/shrub (Tamarix spp.) in a southwestern US watershed},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1729-1742},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The capacity for plant species or populations to cope with herbivory
   depends in large part on the complex interactions between resource
   availability, life history and adaptive strategies to maximize defense
   and/or tolerance to herbivory. Given these complex interactions, the
   impacts of repeated herbivory on plant stress and subsequent mortality
   is often difficult to predict. To better understand relationships
   between herbivory and environmental condition, we studied the
   relationship between the non-native shrub/tree tamarisk (Tamarix spp.)
   and a specialist herbivore, the northern tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda
   carinulata) released as a biological control agent of Tamarix in the
   Virgin River watershed in the southwestern United States. The beetle
   feeds exclusively on Tamarix foliage resulting in complete stand foliage
   desiccation (i.e. defoliation) that lasts several weeks. Approximately
   900 Tamarix plants were surveyed over three consecutive growing seasons
   for canopy dieback and mortality across 10 sites varying in the number
   of defoliation events, tree height, soil salinity, soil texture and bulk
   leaf carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13). Canopy dieback increased from
   27\% by volume in the spring of 2012 to 41\% and 54\% in 2013 and 2014,
   respectively. Tree mortality increased from 0\% in 2012 to 6\% and 10\%
   in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Surprisingly, percent canopy dieback was
   not related to the number of defoliation events that ranged from 2 to 7
   across the 10 sites prior to the 2013 growing season. On the other hand,
   canopy dieback increased with soil salinity in both 2013 (R-2 = 0.39, F
   = 5.07, P = 0.055) and 2014 (R-2 = 0.56, F = 10.26, P = 0.015). Canopy
   dieback in 2013 increased with bulk leaf delta C-13 (R-2 = 0.38, F =
   4.08, P = 0.078), although delta C-13 also decreased with the number of
   defoliation events (R-2 = 0.64, F = 14.17, P = 0.0055), suggesting that
   photosynthetic rate or drought stress (as indicated by leaf delta C-13)
   may serve as a poor predictor for Tamarix canopy dieback in response to
   defoliation. Percent canopy dieback was correlated with shifts in NDVI
   measured from annual MODIS imagery (R-2 = 0.61, F = 12.32, P = 0.008),
   demonstrating that the tree surveys reflect site-scale changes in canopy
   cover. Results show that patterns of Tamarix canopy dieback and
   subsequent mortality following episodic defoliation by Diorhabda
   carinulata are likely to vary across broad gradients in soil salinity
   and other abiotic and biotic factors. Documented impacts of this
   biocontrol agent reported here will aid management efforts aimed at
   preserving riparian habitat in the short-term with conservation efforts
   targeting the removal and control of Tamarix over the long term.},

Title = {Physiological consequences of consuming low-energy foods: herbivory
   coincides with a stress response in Yellowstone bears},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Meat, fruit, seeds and other high-energy bear foods are often highly
   localized and briefly available and understanding which factors
   influence bear consumption of these foods is a common focus of bear
   conservation and ecology. However, the most common bear foods,
   graminoids and forbs, are more widespread but of lower quality. We
   poorly understand how herbage consumption impacts bear physiology, such
   as endocrine system function that regulates homeostasis and stress
   responses. Here, we described bear diets with a novel approach,
   measuring the concentration of chlorophyll in bear scats (faecal
   chlorophyll) to index the proportion of the recent diet that was
   composed of leaves fromgraminoids and forbs. We measured faecal
   chlorophyll and faecal cortisol in 351 grizzly (Ursus arctos, n = 255)
   and black bear (Ursus americanus, n = 96) scats from Yellowstone
   National Park in 2008-2009. We compared models of faecal chlorophyll and
   faecal cortisol concentrations considering the effects of spatial,
   dietary, scat and bear-specific factors including species. Faecal
   chlorophyll levels were the strongest predictor of faecal cortisol in a
   manner that suggested an endocrine response to a low-energy diet. Both
   compounds were highest during the spring and early summer months,
   overlapping the breeding season when higher energy foods were less
   available. Effects of scat composition, scat weathering, bear age, bear
   sex, species and other factors that have previously been shown to
   influence faecal cortisol in bears were not important unless faecal
   chlorophyll was excluded from models. The top models of faecal
   chlorophyll suggested grazing was primarily influenced by spatial
   attributes, with greater grazing closer to recreational trails, implying
   that elevated cortisol with grazing could be a response to anthropogenic
   activity. Our results confirm that higher stress hormone concentrations
   correspond with lower quality diets in bears, particularly grazing, and
   that faecal chlorophyll shows promise as a metric for studying grazing
   behaviour and its consequences.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Red deer have been subjected to anthropogenic interference for many
   centuries. Most populations are managed according to hunting schedules,
   some have been kept long-term in enclosures and other populations have
   been restocked with foreign deer. The red deer in the Brittany region of
   north-western France only occupy the largest forests in the region,
   reaching quite high densities in restricted areas. Here, we aimed to
   assess the extent of the genetic variability of the populations in four
   forest fragments and investigate their population genetic structure. We
   show that, despite relatively large expected heterozygosity values,
   these geographically isolated populations are genetically impoverished
   relative to individuals from large continuous forests in other parts of
   Western Europe. We provide evidence for population genetic structure
   with large genetic differentiation between geographically close
   populations, suggesting the absence of effective exchange between the
   forests. Using samples from the most likely source population, we show
   that at least two populations were non-indigenous. In order to limit
   further loss of genetic diversity, it should be a management objective
   to reduce isolation of the different forests, rather than further
   increase it by fences and hunting practices that could limit free
   movement of red deer.},

Abstract = {The modification of pristine wildlife habitats by land use is a
   worldwide cause of species extinction, as most native species cannot
   persist at high levels of human land use intensity. In this study, we
   gathered 90 lists of local interactions between herbivorous insects and
   their host plants to investigate the effects of land use intensity on
   the species richness and taxonomic diversity of insect herbivore
   assemblages. The effect of land use intensity on these insect herbivore
   assemblages was assessed using path analysis that controlled for
   differences in host plant richness, sampling effort, and the taxonomic
   range of plants and herbivores. We included the proportion of exotic
   host plant species in the path models to evaluate the extent to which
   the effect of land use intensity is mediated by the replacement of
   native with exotic host plants. Overall, we found negative effects of
   land use intensity on the species richness and taxonomic diversity of
   the insect herbivore assemblages, and these effects were mediated by an
   increase in the proportion of exotic host plant species. Since the
   effect of host plant richness was controlled for, our findings imply
   that the impoverishment of insect herbivore assemblages due to human
   land use is even greater than the loss of their host plant. A likely
   implication of such reduction in the species richness and taxonomic
   diversity of the insect herbivore assemblages is the accelerated loss of
   specialized plant-herbivore interactions, thus favoring interactions
   among generalist species and the biotic homogenization of species
   interactions across human-disturbed habitats.},

Abstract = {The Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS) model in Brazil provides legal
   context for monitoring wildlife with the involvement of local
   populations in gathering data and developing strategies for sustainable
   use. We present results of one year of self monitoring by hunters in
   five communities within the RDS-PP, discuss how the observed patterns
   reflect local hunting regulations, and suggest how this information
   could be incorporated into a formal management system. In addition to
   the offtake data, we interviewed hunters, inquiring about informal
   community hunting norms and agreements, and analysed the content of 19
   rules in the reserve's management plan. 509 hunting events were recorded
   by 37 of the 104 families present (35\%). Self monitoring permitted the
   evaluation of temporal and spatial fluctuations of hunting activities,
   notably regarding ease of canoe transport during the high-water season.
   Though communities have been apprehensive about developing regulations
   for subsistence hunting, one of the communities had developed a set of
   formal rules. Hunting for commercial sale to outsiders and restrictions
   on external hunters are concerns shared by the local population and the
   reserve management agencies. Such data and understanding are crucial to
   the management of protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon, where
   governance is often limited.},

Title = {From science to policy-a geostatistical approach to identifying
   potential areas for cetacean conservation: a case study of bottlenose
   dolphins in the Pelagos sanctuary (Mediterranean Sea)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {449-458},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Cetaceans are top-level predators that serve as sentinels of the health
   and status of lower trophic levels in the marine ecosystem. For this
   reason they attract significant attention in marine conservation
   planning and often have been used to promote designation of reserve
   areas in many countries (e.g., Ligurian Sea, Moray Firth, Hawaiian
   Islands, The Gully, Wadden Sea, Banks Peninsula, and Golfo San Jos,).
   Many policies are designed to protect cetaceans. For example, the
   Habitat Directive requires member states to select, designate, and
   protect sites that support certain natural habitats or species, such as
   the bottlenose dolphin, as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) that aim
   to create a network of protected areas across the European Union known
   as Natura 2000. The boundaries of protected areas for cetacean species
   must be defined for management purposes. In recent years, many
   techniques have been developed to define the distribution of cetaceans
   in relation to habitat preferences. Although these models can provide an
   understanding of the ecological processes that determine species
   distribution, their application requires prior knowledge of the
   variables that should be included in the model, the interactions among
   these variables, and their effects on species distribution. Thus, the
   lack of available data in understudied areas precludes the application
   of these types of models. As an alternative, we describe a
   geostatistical approach to identifying areas that potentially should be
   designated as marine protected areas for cetaceans. We illustrate the
   application of the kriging algorithm to the bottlenose dolphin
   population that resides in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The data
   derived from a 7-year survey were used. The encounter rate is the only
   variable required for this method, making it very easy to apply. The
   resulting georeferenced and high resolution map includes areas most
   visited by bottlenose dolphins, which are called core areas. Core areas
   are helpful for establishing the boundaries of marine reserves for the
   protection of the species. The approach described herein is accurate,
   precise, unbiased, replicable to all highly mobile species and easy to
   understand by both researchers and policy makers.},

Title = {Predation of wildlife by free-ranging domestic dogs in Polish hunting
   grounds and potential competition with the grey wolf},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {201},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Although the domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is a ubiquitous exotic
   predator that can detrimentally affect natural environments, studies on
   their ecological impact are relatively scarce, particularly at a
   national scale. We exploited data derived from Polish Hunting
   Association reports to provide a national evaluation of rural free
   ranging dogs in Poland. Our results demonstrate that free-ranging dogs
   are widespread and abundant, frequently killing wildlife and livestock
   in Poland and likely exerting intraguild competition with native
   carnivores such as grey wolves (Canis lupus). On average, hunting club
   records estimate that over 138,000 rural free-ranging dogs occurred
   annually in hunting grounds. In addition, nearly 3000 free-ranging
   greyhounds and their mixed breeds occurred annually on hunting grounds,
   although greyhound hunting has been banned in Poland and they are
   legally required to be restrained within fencing. On average, over
   33,000 wild animals and 280 livestock were killed by free-ranging dogs
   on Polish hunting grounds annually. The number of both wild animals and
   livestock killed by dogs were strongly and positively correlated with
   the numbers of rural free-ranging dogs recorded on hunting grounds,
   reflective of their predation pressure. Also, the number of wild animals
   killed by dogs was positively correlated with estimates of population
   sizes and harvest levels of wildlife, reflective of prey availability.
   Dog predation, in conjunction with harvest by humans, may cause
   unsustainable off-take rates of some game species. Grey wolves,
   documented within 39 of the 49 Hunting Districts, ate similar prey as
   dogs, including ungulates and livestock, and killed dogs on hunting
   grounds, suggesting both resource and interference competition between
   these sympatric canids. This comprehensive analysis provides important
   information about the ecological impact of free-ranging dogs and
   recommendations for alternative legislative and management measures to
   control their impacts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {182},
Pages = {1-7},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Trade in large cats (Panthera and Neofelis species), and indeed other
   wild cats, is a clear impediment to their conservation. Myanmar is an
   important country for cat conservation, both because of the presence of
   significant populations of threatened species but equally as it is
   positioned strategically between China, Thailand and India. Here we
   analyse data from large cat skins and other cat parts observed openly
   for sale at two border towns in Myanmar. Data from Tachilek on the
   Myanmar-Thailand border (19 surveys, 1991-2013) and Mong La on the
   Myanmar-China border (7 surveys, 2001-2014) show that the most common
   species in trade was the clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa (482
   individuals; observed in 22/24 surveys), followed by leopard cat
   Prionailurus bengalensis (458 individuals; 11/12 surveys), leopard
   Panthera pardus (344; 22/24 surveys), tiger P. tigris (207 individuals;
   21/24 surveys) and Asiatic golden cat Catopuma temmincki (135
   individuals; 10/12 surveys). Volumes of skins held no relationship with
   the number of other cat parts (e.g. skull, claws and canines) in trade.
   The number of small cat skins observed was positively related to the
   number of large cat skins. There were no indications that leopards or
   clouded leopards were used as replacement for tigers. While the number
   of shops selling cat parts increased in Mong La from 6 in 2006 to 21 in
   2014 there was no associated temporal increase in trade, whereas the
   number of shops decreased from 35 in 2000 to 6 in 2013 in Tachilek and
   this coincided with a decrease in available cat parts. These data show
   that in the last decades the trade of cat parts from Myanmar into
   Thailand has diminished and reaffirms the role of China in the trade of
   cats out of Myanmar. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The genetic diversity and population structure of a population of
   African lions in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, was studied using 17
   microsatellite loci. Spatial genetic analysis using Bayesian methods
   suggested a weak genetic structure within the population and high levels
   of gene flow across the study area. We were able to identify a few
   individuals with aberrant or admixed ancestry, which we interpreted as
   either immigrants or as descendants thereof. This, together with
   relatively high genetic diversity, suggests that immigrants from beyond
   the study area have influenced the genetic structure within the park. We
   suggest that the levels of genetic diversity and the observed weak
   structure are indicative of the large and viable Okavango-Hwange
   population of which our study population is a part. Genetic patterns can
   also be attributed to still existing high levels of habitat connectivity
   between protected areas. Given expected increases in human populations
   and anthropogenic impacts, efforts to identify and maintain existing
   movement corridors between regional lion populations will be important
   in retaining the high genetic diversity status of this population. Our
   results show that understanding existing levels of genetic diversity and
   genetic connectivity has implications, not only for this lion
   population, but also for managing large wild populations of carnivores.},

Title = {Genetic sexing of stock-raiding leopards: not only males to blame},
Journal = {CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1101-1105},

Abstract = {Lethal control of stock-raiding predators is generally assumed to have
   fewer consequences for the species' population dynamics if it involves
   males only. However, very little data are available that assess whether
   shot ``problem{''} animals indeed are essentially males. In this study,
   we used two independent genetic methods (four X-chromosomal polymorphic
   microsatellite loci and the sex-specific ZFXY marker) validated against
   known-sex samples to determine, from skin samples collected over a
   6-year period, the sex of 59 leopards (Panthera pardus) shot by farmers
   in Botswana. We found that out of 53 leopards that could be sexed
   genetically, 21 were females (39.6 \%); males were thus not
   significantly more often shot than females. Comparing the genetically
   determined sex of shot leopards to that reported by farmers showed that
   58.3 \% were mistaken for the opposite sex. Our genetic study revealed
   that more females than presumed are hunted in response to alleged
   livestock predation. With females frequently misidentified as males, the
   current practice of shooting ``problem{''} animals is likely to
   negatively affect the population dynamics of leopards. These genetic
   data may be used to guide the development of a revised management policy
   for large-carnivore hunting. Importantly, models of sustainable harvest
   need to include female off-take as a parameter.},

Title = {The ecological impact of humans and dogs on wildlife in protected areas
   in eastern North America},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {203},
Pages = {75-88},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The establishment of protected areas is a key strategy for preserving
   biodiversity. However, human use of protected areas can cause
   disturbance to wildlife, especially in areas that allow hunting and if
   humans are accompanied by dogs (Canis familiaris). We used
   citizen-science run camera traps to investigate how humans, dogs and
   coyotes (Canis latrans) used 33 protected areas and analyzed behavioral
   responses by three prey species: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and northern
   raccoon (Procyon lotor). We obtained 52,863 detections of native
   wildlife, 162,418 detections of humans and 23,332 detections of dogs
   over 42,874 camera nights. Most dogs (99\%) were on the trail, and 89\%
   of off-trail dogs were accompanied by humans. Prey avoided dogs, humans
   and coyotes temporally, but did not avoid them spatially, or greatly
   increase vigilance. Our results indicate that humans are perceived as a
   greater risk than coyotes, and this increases when dogs accompany their
   owners. The concentration of dogs on the trail with their owners, and
   relatively minor behavioral impacts on prey, contrasts the strong
   negative ecological effects found in studies of free ranging dogs. We
   found dog management to be effective: prohibiting dogs in protected
   areas reduced their use of an area by a factor of 10 and leash laws
   increased leashing rates by 21\%. Although millions of dogs use natural
   areas in North America each year, regulations enacted by protected areas
   combined with responsible management of dog behavior greatly reduce the
   ecological impact of man's best friend. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Assessing forest products usage and local residents' perception of
   environmental changes in peri-urban and rural mangroves of Cameroon,
   Central Africa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {Background: Deforestation is one of the most ubiquitous forms of land
   degradation worldwide. Although remote sensing and aerial photographs
   can supply valuable information on land/use cover changes, they may not
   regularly be available for some tropical coasts (e.g., Cameroon estuary)
   where cloud cover is frequent. With respect to mangroves, researchers
   are now employing local knowledge as an alternative means of
   understanding forest disturbances. This paper was primarily aimed at
   assessing the mangrove forest products usage, along with the local
   people's perceptions on environmental changes, between Littoral
   (Cameroon estuary) and Southern (mouth of the Nyong River and Mpalla
   village) regions of Cameroon.
   Methods: The data from both locations were obtained through conducting
   household interviews and field observations.
   Results: In the Cameroon estuary (Littoral region), 69.23\% of
   respondents (mostly elders) could distinguish two to four mangrove
   plants, whereas the informants (65.45\%) in the mouth of the Nyong River
   and Mpalla village (mostly young people interviewed from the Southern
   region) are familiar with only one or two commonly found mangroves.
   Also, more respondents from the Cameroon estuary are depending on
   mangroves for fuelwood (Rhizophora spp.) and housing (Rhizophora spp.,
   Avicennia germinans (L.) Stearn and Nypa fruticans (Thumb.) Wurmb.)
   purposes, in contrast to Nyong River mouth and Mpalla village. Although
   local people perceived wood extraction as a greater disruptive factor,
   there are several causes for mangrove depletion in the Cameroon estuary.
   Among others, over-harvesting, clear-felled corridors, sand extraction
   and housing were found important. Furthermore, a decline in mangrove
   fauna composition (in terms of fishery products) was recorded in the
   Littoral as well as Southern regions. However, the causes of such
   perceived negative changes were not similar in both cases.
   Conclusions: Findings of this study highlight the need to improve
   sustainable management of the mangrove ecosystems through afforestation
   (in large impacted areas), selective removal of senescent tree stems and
   branches (in little damage stands), regulating sand extraction and
   housing activities, and creating awareness and law enforcement.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY},

Abstract = {Data on the prehistoric biota of the Socotra Archipelago (Yemen) are
   scarce. We report on the first extinct vertebrate ever recorded from
   this western Indian Ocean island group. An exceptionally preserved adult
   specimen of Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus was found in a
   calcite flowstone in Hoq Cave on the NE coast of Socotra Island.
   Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating on bone fragments
   estimates the fossil at ca. 7600-7400 cal a BP (radiocarbon age 6669 +/-
   70 C-14 a BP) corresponding to an early Holocene wet period in southern
   Arabia and the Horn of Africa. Morphometric analysis of the skull
   compared to Recent specimens from the neighbouring mainlands finds the
   fossil morphologically most similar to Egyptian (Nile Valley and Libyan
   Desert), not to East African or Middle Eastern populations. The species
   is currently absent from the Horn of Africa (Somalia and Eastern
   Ethiopia). Although potentially a stray individual, we also discuss the
   palaeoenvironmental implications under the hypothetical scenario that
   the fruit bat is a remnant of an extinct resident population. If so, the
   extinction of an important pollinator and seed disperser may have
   impacted the Socotran terrestrial ecosystems.},

Title = {Beyond survival experiments: using biomarkers of oxidative stress and
   neurotoxicity to assess vulnerability of subterranean fauna to climate
   change},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Accurate assessments of species vulnerability to climate change need to
   consider the physiological capacity of organisms to deal with
   temperature changes and identify early signs of thermally induced
   stress. Oxidative stress biomarkers and acetylcholinesterase activity
   are useful proxies of stress at the cellular and nervous system level.
   Such responses are especially relevant for poor dispersal organisms with
   limited capacity for behavioural thermoregulation, like deep
   subterranean species. We combined experimental measurements of upper
   lethal thermal limits, acclimation capacity and biomarkers of oxidative
   stress and neurotoxicity to assess the impact of heat stress (20 degrees
   C) at different exposure times (2 and 7 days) on the Iberian endemic
   subterranean beetle Parvospeonomus canyellesi. Survival response (7 days
   of exposure) was similar to that reported for other subterranean
   specialist beetles (high survival up to 20 degrees C but no above 23
   degrees C). However, a low physiological plasticity (i.e. incapacity to
   increase heat tolerance via acclimation) and signs of impairment at the
   cellular and nervous system level were observed after 7 days of exposure
   at 20 degrees C. Such sublethal effects were identified by significant
   differences in total antioxidant capacity, glutathione S-transferase
   activity, the ratio of reduced to oxidized forms of glutathione and
   acetylcholinesterase activity between the control (cave temperature) and
   20 degrees C treatment. At 2 days of exposure, most biomarker values
   indicated some degree of oxidative stress in both the control and
   high-temperature treatment, likely reflecting an initial altered
   physiological status associated to factors other than temperature.
   Considering these integrated responses and the predicted increase in
   temperature in its unique locality, P. canyellesi would have a narrower
   thermal safety margin to face climate change than that obtained
   considering only survival experiments. Our results highlight the
   importance of exploring thermally sensitive processes at different
   levels of biological organization to obtain more accurate estimates of
   the species capacity to face climate change.},

Title = {Resource selection in an apex predator and variation in response to
   local landscape characteristics},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {228},
Pages = {233-240},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation represent major threats for the
   conservation of apex predators, such as the jaguar (Panthera onca).
   Investigating species' resource selection behavior in response to
   landscape alteration is critical for developing relevant conservation
   management plans. The jaguar is found across a variety of habitats with
   different gradients of human disturbance, making them a good candidate
   to study how apex predators respond to increasing intensity of human
   land use. We developed resource selection models to characterize
   patterns of jaguar resource selection at two different spatial scales,
   home range (coarse) and foraging scale (fine). This analysis was based
   on the largest existing GPS-location dataset for jaguars (n = 40
   individuals, n = 87,376 locations), spanning the species' geographic
   range in Brazil and Argentina. We found that both males and females
   jaguars exhibited an overall preference for forests and areas close to
   watercourses at both the home range and foraging scale. At the foraging
   scale, areas of high livestock density ``attracted{''} male jaguars. We
   also performed a follow-up analysis to test for context-dependent
   resource selection (i.e., functional responses) by relating individual
   behavior to local habitat characteristics. We found that jaguars in
   heavily-forested landscapes showed strong avoidance of non-forest.
   Furthermore, we found that only the individuals in closest proximity to
   watercourses showed positive selection for water. Our results highlight
   that jaguars display different patterns of resource selection in
   different areas, demonstrating a considerable ability to use or tolerate
   a wide variety of different conditions across the species geographic
   range. This plasticity may allow jaguars to adjust their behavior
   according to land use changes but also increases human-jaguar conflict
   and jaguar mortality, especially in areas with high livestock density.},

Abstract = {The first report of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) infected with
   a novel Hepatozoon species is presented. An intraleukocytic parasite was
   detected via routine blood smear from a zoo-housed giant panda at the
   National Zoological Park. Ribosomal DNA sequences indicated a previously
   undescribed Hepatozoon species. Phylogenetic and distance analyses of
   the sequences placed it within its own branch, clustered with Old World
   species with carnivore (primarily ursid and mustelid) hosts.
   Retrospective and opportunistic testing of other individuals produced
   additional positive detections (17/23, 73.9\%), demonstrating 100\%
   prevalence (14/14) across five institutions. All animals were
   asymptomatic at time of sampling, and health implications for giant
   pandas remain unknown.},

Title = {Overcoming extreme weather challenges: Successful but variable assisted

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {150},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-75},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Assisted colonization of endangered species to locations outside their
   native ranges in response to projected climate change has emerged as a
   potential, but highly controversial conservation tool. The debate has
   been largely philosophical and hypothetical as little biological data
   exist in the literature. In 2006, nearly 1000 endangered wild orchid
   plants belonging to 29 species were translocated to higher elevations in
   subtropical southwestern China in response to inundation threats from a
   hydropower project. We took advantage of this upward translocation to
   address one of the main biological concerns associated with assisted
   colonization, i.e. whether the target endangered species can survive in
   the novel environment that is projected to be suitable for them,
   sometime in the future. We assessed the impacts of two extreme weather
   events, translocation shock and herbivory, on survival of 20 of these
   species and 462 individuals that were translocated beyond their current
   range vs. within that range. A cold spell in 2008 on average caused 10\%
   mortality, less than the mortality rate from herbivores. However, the
   cold spell was the only force that extirpated an out-of-range
   population. No mortality resulted from a drought event in 2010. The
   5-year survival percentages were not different between low and wide
   elevation species (69.3\% mean +/- 36.3\% standard deviation vs. 67.3\%
   +/- 30.9\%). Orchids represent 10\% of flowering plant diversity and are
   among the most endangered group of organisms due to a combination of
   their often specialized ecological requirements, habitat destruction,
   and overexploitation. The demonstrated ability to survive extreme
   environmental challenges indicates that assisted colonization may be a
   viable conservation tool for the many endangered orchids worldwide due
   to climate change and/or other reasons. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Spatial modelling of non-target exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides
   can inform mitigation options in two boreal predators inhabiting areas
   with intensive oil and gas development},

Abstract = {Intensive industrial development occurs in the ecologically significant
   boreal forest, including oil and gas development in northern Alberta,
   Canada. This forest is home to many highly-valued animal species
   including fisher (Pekania pennanti; formerly Manes pennant and American
   marten (Marta americana). Second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides
   (SGARs) are commonly used near human infrastructure in developed areas
   to control and reduce damage from rodent pests. High body burdens of
   SGARs in rodent prey pose risks of secondary poisoning for fisher and
   marten that readily consume rodents. The objective of this research was
   to determine if fisher and marten living in anthropogenically-disturbed
   areas of northern Alberta showed evidence of SGAR exposure. Fisher and
   marten carcasses were collected from the region, aged, sexed, and liver
   samples were analysed for rodenticides using liquid-chromatography mass
   spectrometry (LCMS). SGARs were found in the livers of non-target fisher
   and marten. As SGARs were found in the livers of fisher with sufficient
   frequency for complete statistical analysis, analyses including ANOVA,
   linear regression, and spatial cluster analyses were used to assess
   spatial patterns exhibited by fisher exposure frequencies against
   potential explanatory variables such as boreal anthropogenic
   disturbances and land cover classes. Additionally, companies operating
   in the region were surveyed to identify their current rodent control
   measures in an effort to verify the results of the spatial analyses.
   This is the first study to demonstrate non-target SGAR exposure of
   fisher and marten in Canada. Exposure frequency in fisher exhibited
   clustering, which showed the strongest relationships to factors
   including total boreal disturbances, number of oil sands mines, and
   broadleaf forest cover. The spatial methods used in this paper provide
   tools to develop local interventions for mitigation and conservation
   efforts.},

Title = {Reduced Effect of Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumor Disease at the Disease
   Front},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {124-134},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Pathogen-driven declines in animal populations are increasingly regarded
   as a major conservation issue. The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus
   harrisii) is threatened with extinction by devil facial tumor disease, a
   unique transmissible cancer. The disease is transmitted through direct
   transfer of tumor cells, which is possible because the genetic diversity
   of Tasmanian devils is low, particularly in the major histocompatibility
   complex genes of the immune system. The far northwest of Tasmania now
   holds the last remaining disease-free wild devil populations. The recent
   discovery of unique major histocompatibility complex genotypes in the
   northwestern region of Tasmania has raised the possibility that some
   animals may be resilient to the disease. We examined the differences in
   the epidemiology and population effects of devil facial tumor disease at
   3 well-studied affected sites in eastern Tasmania and 1 in western
   Tasmania (West Pencil Pine). In contrast to the 3 eastern sites, there
   has been no rapid increase in disease prevalence or evidence of
   population decline at West Pencil Pine. Moreover, this is the only
   onsite at which the population age structure has remained unaltered 4
   years after the first detection of disease. The most plausible
   explanations for the substantial differences in population effects and
   epidemiology of the disease between eastern and western sites are
   geographic differences in genotypes or phenotypes of devils and
   functional differences between tumor strains in the 2 regions. We
   suggest that conservation efforts focus on identifying whether either or
   both these explanations are correct and then, if resistance alleles
   exist, to attempt to spread the resistant alleles into affected
   populations. Such assisted selection has rarely been attempted for the
   management of wildlife diseases, but it may be widely applicable.},

Title = {Defining practical and robust study designs for interventions targeted
   at terrestrial mammalian predators},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Conflicts between humans and mammalian predators are globally widespread
   and increasing, creating a long-lasting challenge for conservation and
   local livelihoods. Protection interventions, which are essential to
   conflict mitigation, should be based on solid evidence of effectiveness
   produced by robust study designs. Yet, it is unclear what study designs
   have been used in predator-targeted interventions and how they can be
   improved to provide best practices for replications. I examined how
   applications of five study designs (before-after,
   before-after-control-impact, control-impact, crossover {[}i.e., the same
   randomly assigned study units acting as treatments and controls during
   alternating trials], and randomized controlled trial) have changed over
   time and how these changes are related to authors, predator species,
   countries, and intervention types (aversion, husbandry, mixed
   interventions, invasive management, lethal control, and noninvasive
   management). I applied multinomial regression modeling to 434 cases (28
   predator species and 45 countries) from 244 studies published from 1955
   to 2020. Study design was related only to intervention type. Less
   reliable before-after and control-impact studies were the most common
   (47.7\% and 38.2\% of cases, respectively), and their use increased over
   years as did all interventions. The contribution of the most robust
   before-after-control-impact (7.4\%), randomized controlled trial
   (5.3\%), and crossover designs (1.4\%) remained minor over time.
   Crossover is suitable for aversion, most husbandry techniques, and a few
   other interventions, but crossover interventions also have the most
   limitations in terms of applicability. Randomized controlled trial is
   generally applicable, but impractical or inappropriate for some
   interventions, and before-after-control-impact appears to be the most
   widely applicable study design for predator-targeted interventions.},

Title = {Effects of human disturbance on postnatal growth and baseline
   corticosterone in a long-lived bird},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Prolonged or repeated episodes of environmental stress could be
   especially detrimental for developing young, via impaired growth or
   development. Despite this, most studies investigating the effects of
   human recreational and tourism activities have focused on adults. An
   increasing demand for nature-based tourism in remote locations means
   that many seabirds, which have evolved largely in the absence of
   predators and humans, are being exposed to novel pressures. The
   slow-growing semi-precocial nestlings of the European storm petrel
   Hydrobates pelagicus experience higher mortality rates in nests exposed
   to human recreational disturbance. Here, we examine whether surviving
   nestlings reared in disturbed areas are also affected via changes in
   growth trajectories and baseline circulating glucocorticoids. Nestlings
   reared in high-disturbance areas displayed delayed mass growth, and we
   found weak evidence for slower rates of mass gain and tarsus growth,
   compared with nestlings reared in undisturbed areas. There were no
   differences in wing growth, consistent with prioritization of long
   wings, important for post-fledging survival. A tendency for a less
   marked age-related decline in corticosterone (CORT) in disturbed
   nestlings offers limited evidence that changes in growth trajectories
   were mediated by baseline CORT. However, disturbed nestlings could have
   experienced overall higher GC exposure if the acute GC response was
   elevated. `Catch-up' growth enabled high-disturbance nestlings to
   overcome early constraints and achieve a similar, or even larger,
   asymptotic body size and mass as low-disturbance nestlings. While
   catch-up growth has been shown to carry costs for parents and offspring,
   the effects of disturbance were slight and considerably smaller than
   growth alterations driven by variation in environmental conditions
   between years. Nonetheless, effects of human recreational activities
   could be exacerbated under higher levels of human disturbance or in the
   presence of multiple pressures, as imposed by present rapid rates of
   environmental change.},

Volume = {46},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {205-210},

Abstract = {Although drones are becoming very common in the skies, most concerns
   about their use are not focused on their possible impact on wildlife. We
   used the information available from the scientific literature on the
   effects of drones on wildlife and complement it with Internet (YouTube)
   information to evaluate whether recreational activities using drones
   produce behavioural responses from wildlife. Scientific papers
   specifically evaluating the effects of drones on wildlife are scarce but
   increasing. Nonetheless, we found abundant videos in which many species
   from different taxonomic groups and multiple countries presented
   behavioural responses to drone overflights. Furthermore, 26\% of the
   species that were disturbed are included in one of the International
   Union for Conservation of Nature categories of threat. We found that
   wildlife that use aerial and terrestrial habitats are more likely to
   show a behavioural response than those occupying aquatic habitats. The
   Internet is becoming a source of evidence of disturbances to wildlife
   that should be considered, particularly for recreational activities. We
   advocate for the use of technology, but argue that funding and effort
   should be devoted to evaluating drone impacts on wildlife. We call for
   educational programmes for laypeople who use drones for recreation and
   for more research and regulations on their use in sensitive wildlife
   areas.},

Pages = {327-336},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Technological advancements in remote sensing and telemetry provide
   opportunities for assessing the effects of expanding extractive
   industries on animal populations. Here, we illustrate the applicability
   of resource selection functions (RSFs) for modelling wildlife habitat
   selection on industrially-disturbed landscapes. We used grizzly bears
   (Ursus arctos) from a threatened population in Canada and surface mining
   as a case study. RSF predictions based on GPS radiocollared bears
   (n(during) (mining) = 7; n(post mining) = 9) showed that males and
   solitary females selected areas primarily outside mineral surface leases
   (MSLs) during active mining, and conversely inside MSLs after mine
   closure. However, females with cubs selected areas within compared to
   outside MSLs irrespective of mining activity. Individual variability was
   pronounced, although some environmental and human-related variables were
   consistent across reproductive classes. For males and solitary females,
   regional-scale RSFs yielded comparable results to site-specific models,
   whereas for females with cubs, modelling the two scales produced
   divergent results. While mine reclamation may afford opportunities for
   bear persistence, managing public access will likely decrease the risk
   of human-caused bear mortality. RSFs are powerful tools that merit
   widespread use in quantitative and visual investigations of wildlife
   habitat selection on industrially-modified landscapes, using Geographic
   Information System layers that precisely characterize site-specific
   conditions.},

Title = {Psychological drivers of risk-reducing behaviors to limit human-wildlife

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1383-1392},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Conflicts between people and wild animals are increasing globally, often
   with serious consequences for both. Local regulations or ordinances are
   frequently used to promote human behaviors that minimize these conflicts
   (risk-reducing behaviors), but compliance with ordinances can be highly
   variable. While efforts to increase compliance could be improved through
   applications of conservation psychology, little is known about the
   relative influence of different factors motivating compliance. Using
   concepts from psychology and risk theory, we conducted a longitudinal
   study pairing data from mail surveys with direct observations of
   compliance with a wildlife ordinance requiring residents to secure
   residential garbage from black bears (Ursus americanus). We assessed the
   relative influence of beliefs and attitudes toward bears and bear
   proofing, perceived behavioral control, perceived risks and benefits
   assigned to bears, norms, trust in management, previous experience with
   conflicts, and demographics on compliance behavior (i.e., bear
   proofing). Data on previous experience were obtained through direct
   observation and survey reports. We found that higher compliance rates
   were associated with more observed conflicts on a respondent's block.
   Counter to expectations, however, residents were less compliant when
   they were more trusting of the management agency and perceived more
   benefits from bears. We suggest that messages have the potential to
   increase compliance when they empower residents by linking successful
   management of conflicts to individual actions and emphasize how reducing
   conflicts could maintain benefits provided by wildlife. Modifying

Title = {Use of Experimental Translocations of Allegheny Woodrat to Decipher
   Causal Agents of Decline},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {752-762},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Translocations are an important tool for wildlife conservation, although
   progress in the field of reintroduction biology has been hindered by the
   ad hoc and opportunistic nature of many translocations. We used an
   experimental translocation to elucidate the role of raccoon roundworm
   (Baylisascaris procyonis) and inbreeding depression in the decline of
   the Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister), an endangered species. We
   translocated woodrats from genetically diverse populations in the core
   of the species range to 4 previously occupied sites (reintroductions)
   and 2 sites supporting genetically depauperate populations
   (reinforcements) in Indiana (U.S.A.). In 2 reintroduction sites and 1
   reinforcement site, we distributed anthelmintic baits to passively
   deworm raccoons and reduce the risk of woodrat exposure to roundworms.
   The remaining sites served as controls. We used raccoon latrine surveys
   and fecal flotation to monitor temporal variability in roundworm
   prevalence and effect of treatment. We used live trapping and
   microsatellite genotyping to monitor the demographic and genetic
   response of translocated populations over the following 54 months. At
   the conclusion of the study, 4 of 6 translocations were successfully
   maintaining abundance through local recruitment. The distribution of
   anthelmintic baits reduced levels of roundworm contamination, but levels
   of contamination were also low in 2 of 3 control sites. Reintroductions
   failed at control sites, one of which was due to high roundworm
   exposure. The other failed control reintroduction was likely
   attributable to demographic stochasticity and limited reproductive
   potential following initial mortality within the first 4 months. In both
   control and treatment reinforcements, increases in both allelic richness
   and heterozygosity were accompanied by increases in abundance, which is
   suggestive of genetic rescue. Our results demonstrate that mitigation of
   roundworm exposure through the distribution of anthelmintic baits can
   facilitate woodrat recovery and that diversity within genetically
   depauperate populations can be restored through the introduction of a
   limited number of individuals.},

Title = {Land surface greening suggests vigorous woody regrowth throughout
   European semi-natural vegetation},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {12},
Pages = {5789-5801},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The satellite record has revealed substantial land surface
   ``greening{''} in the northern hemisphere over recent decades.
   Process-based Earth system models (ESMs) attribute enhanced vegetation
   productivity (greening) to CO2 fertilisation. However, the models poorly
   reproduce observed spatial patterns of greening, suggesting that they
   ignore crucial processes. Here, we explore whether fine-scale land cover
   dynamics, as modified by ecological and land-use processes, can explain
   the discrepancy between models and satellite-based estimates of
   greening. We used 500 m satellite-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) to
   quantify greening. We focus on semi-natural vegetation in Europe, and
   distinguish between conservation areas and unprotected land. Within
   these ecological and land-use categories, we then explored the
   relationships between vegetation change and major climatic gradients.
   Despite the relatively short time-series (15 years), we found a strong
   overall increase in LAI (i.e., greening) across all European
   semi-natural vegetation types. The spatial pattern of vegetation change
   identifies land-use change, particularly land abandonment, as a major
   initiator of vegetation change both in- and outside of protected areas.
   The strongest LAI increases were observed in mild climates, consistent
   with more vigorous woody regrowth after cessation of intensive
   management in these environments. Surprisingly, rates of vegetation
   change within protected areas did not differ significantly from
   unprotected semi-natural vegetation. Overall, the detected LAI increases
   are consistent with previous, coarser-scale, studies. The evidence
   indicates that woody regrowth following land abandonment is an important
   driver of land surface greening throughout Europe. The results offer an
   explanation for the large discrepancies between ESM-derived and
   satellite-derived greening estimates and thus generate new avenues for
   improving the ESMs on which we rely for crucial climate forecasts.},

Title = {Demographic and ecological correlates of a recovering tiger (Panthera
   tigris) population: Lessons learnt from 13-years of monitoring},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {252},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Efforts are on to recover tiger populations range-wide, but we lack
   suitable metrics to characterise and evaluate such recoveries.
   Identifying such metrics requires an understanding of tiger population
   dynamics and its ecological correlates in either recovering populations
   or those exposed to anthropogenic influences. We monitored a recovering
   tiger population from 2004 to 2017 in Rajaji National Park, India. Using
   photographic data and spatial capture-recapture models in an inviolate
   site vacated by pastoralists (zone 1), we identified demographic
   parameters of a recovering population. By contrasting it with a site
   that is presently occupied by pastoralists (zone 3) and one that is
   isolated (zone 3), we identified conditions facilitating recovery. In
   zone 1, connected to a large source population in Corbett Tiger Reserve,
   density increased from 2.08 tigers/100 km(2) to 7.07 tigers/100 km(2)
   corresponding to an annual growth rate of 4.5\%. Density also increased
   in zone 2 (2.6 tigers/100 km(2) to 6.22 tigers/100 km(2)), but estimated
   apparent survival was 0.47 against 0.81 in zone 1. Recovery in zone 1
   was accompanied by increased survival of females, while female tenure
   was shorter in zone 2. Due to the lack of functional connectivity,
   tigers in zone 3 are facing local extinction. Our results demonstrate
   that creating inviolate spaces to secure breeding populations and
   maintaining landscape-wide connectivity to expand breeding cores is
   critical for recovery. We highlight that relying solely on population
   increase may lead to unreliable inferences about population performance
   and instead suggest tracking survival and female land tenure to qualify
   recovery and success of conservation interventions.},

Title = {Using individual-based movement models to assess inter-patch
   connectivity for large carnivores in fragmented landscapes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {167},
Pages = {298-309},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Most rare and endangered large carnivores such as tiger (Panthera
   tigris) exist in human-dominated landscapes as small, fragmented and
   isolated populations across their range. Connectivity between the
   remaining populations in the habitat fragments is essential for their
   long-term persistence and focus of management initiatives. We describe
   an individual-based, spatially explicit model of tiger movement behavior
   based on previously developed habitat models to (i) quantify inter-patch
   connectivity among major (protected) habitat patches in the Terai Arc
   Landscape of India and Nepal and (ii) investigate the effect of
   potential management initiatives, e.g. restoring corridors, on enhancing
   connectivity among fragmented protected habitats. Connectivity was not
   solely a function of distance between patches, but an outcome of the
   interplay between movement behavior and landscape composition, with
   asymmetric connectivity explained by canalizing or diffusing effects of
   the landscape, and depending on the landscape context of the starting
   patch. Patch connectivity was mostly determined by autocorrelation in
   tiger movement, the daily movement capacity, landscape structure, and
   the amount of matrix habitat. Several habitat patches were likely to be
   island-like and already effectively isolated. However, simulating
   scenarios of corridor restoration showed that most habitat patches in
   India and between India and Nepal could recover connectivity, which may
   mitigate negative genetic consequences of small population size and
   effective isolation on tiger populations in this landscape. Combining
   habitat models with individual-based models is a powerful and robust
   approach that could be widely applied to delineate dispersal corridors
   of large carnivores and quantify patch connectivity even if data are
   scarce. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Cattle grazing mitigates the negative impacts of nitrogen addition on
   soil nematode communities},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Livestock grazing and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition have been
   reported as important factors affecting soil communities. However, how
   different large herbivore grazing and N addition may interact to affect
   soil biota in grassland ecosystems is unclear. Nematodes are the most
   abundant metazoan in soil ecosystems, play critical roles in regulating
   carbon and nutrient dynamics, and are valuable bioindicators. We
   examined the independent and interactive effects of grazing regimes (no
   grazing; sheep grazing; cattle grazing; mixed grazing of sheep and
   cattle) and N addition (ambient N; N addition) on soil nematodes in a
   meadow steppe. We found that grazing and N addition interacted to
   influence total nematode abundance, trophic group abundance, generic
   richness, diversity and several nematode-based indices (maturity index,
   channel ratio, enrichment index). In cattle grazing treatment, N
   addition significantly increased total nematode abundance, and the
   abundance of bacterial feeders, plant feeders, and omnivore-predators,
   and generic richness. By contrast, in the sheep and mixed grazing
   treatments, N addition had a negative effect on the same variables.
   Moreover, N addition reduced nematode maturity, enrichment and structure
   indices, and enhanced nematode channel ratio, in most grazing
   treatments, except mixed grazing where N addition had no effect on these
   variables. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that N addition
   indirectly reduced nematode abundance and richness through increased
   soil NO3-N content, whereas the effects of grazing were associated with
   increased relative biomass of grasses. Our results suggested that the
   response of soil nematodes to N addition strongly depended on herbivore
   assemblages. Nitrogen addition enhanced soil nematode diversity and
   maintained a relatively complex and mature soil food web in the presence
   of cattle rather than sheep grazing. Furthermore, our study highlighted
   that under N deposition, cattle grazing could benefit the soil nematode
   community.},

Title = {Ecological impacts of the invasive plant Xanthium strumarium and the
   impacts of three aboveground herbivores on the invader},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {131},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Exotic plant invasions are generally assumed to negatively impact
   biodiversity of recipient communities. However, experimental evidence
   for this assumption is little, especially in developing countries. In
   addition, there is hardly applicable method to control invasive plants.
   Enemy release is often hypothesized to facilitate exotic plant
   invasions, thus re-association with natural enemies of invasive ranges
   may inhibit invasions of exotic plants, and these enemies may have the
   potential to be used as biological control agents for these invaders. To
   address above problems, we determined abundance of the invasive plant
   Xanthium strumarium, its impacts on cooccurring native plants, and
   abundances of three herbivores and their impacts on the invader at five
   sites in the rice tract of Punjab, Pakistan. Relative abundance of the
   invader varied greatly among the study sites, ranging from 3.5\% to
   50.4\%. The invader significantly reduced abundance of co-occurring
   native plants at all study sites, and their richness and evenness at
   some sites with high abundances of the invader. The polyphagous insects
   Phenacoccus solenopsis, Podisus maculiventris and Spodoptera frugiperda
   were all found on the invader (not on crops) at all study sites, which
   significantly reduced growth of the invader. The abundance of P.
   solenopsis on the invader was much higher than those of P. maculiventris
   and S. frugiperda. The abundances of the herbivores were significantly
   higher at sites with high relative to low relative abundances of the
   invader. Our study indicates that natural enemies may accumulate on
   invasive plants with the increase of their abundance and/or invasion
   time, inhibiting further invasions, and provides evidence for enemy
   release hypothesis. More studies are needed to determine whether these
   herbivores, especially P. solenopsis, could be used as biological
   control agents for the invader.},

Title = {Climate change and larval transport in the ocean: fractional effects
   from physical and physiological factors},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1532-1547},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Changes in larval import, export, and self-seeding will affect the
   resilience of coral reef ecosystems. Climate change will alter the ocean
   currents that transport larvae and also increase sea surface
   temperatures (SST), hastening development, and shortening larval
   durations. Here, we use transport simulations to estimate future larval
   connectivity due to: (1) physical transport of larvae from altered
   circulation alone, and (2) the combined effects of altered currents plus
   physiological response to warming. Virtual larvae from islands
   throughout Micronesia were moved according to present-day and future
   ocean circulation models. The Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM)
   spanning 2004-2012 represented present-day currents. For future
   currents, we altered HYCOM using analysis from the National Center for
   Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model, version
   1-Biogeochemistry, Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 experiment.
   Based on the NCAR model, regional SST is estimated to rise 2.74 degrees
   C which corresponds to a similar to 17\% decline in larval duration for
   some taxa. This reduction was the basis for a separate set of
   simulations. Results predict an increase in self-seeding in 100years
   such that 62-76\% of islands experienced increased self-seeding, there
   was an average domainwide increase of similar to 1-3\% points in
   self-seeding, and increases of up to 25\% points for several individual
   islands. When changed currents alone were considered, approximately half
   (i.e., random) of all island pairs experienced decreased connectivity
   but when reduced PLD was added as an effect, similar to 65\% of
   connections were weakened. Orientation of archipelagos relative to
   currents determined the directional bias in connectivity changes. There
   was no universal relationship between climate change and connectivity
   applicable to all taxa and settings. Islands that presently export large
   numbers of larvae but that also maintain or enhance this role into the
   future should be the focus of conservation measures that promote
   long-term resilience of larval supply.},

Abstract = {Populations of large carnivores are declining globally, and analysis of
   public discourse about carnivores is useful for understanding public
   opinion and influences on management and policy. Portrayal of carnivores
   in the media affects public perceptions and support for their
   conservation. We conducted a content analysis of 513 articles about
   Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) published from 2003 to 2006 in
   newspapers with local circulation in core panther habitat in southwest
   Florida and papers with statewide circulation to compare the differences
   in the amount of coverage and portrayals of panther risks to people and
   property on the basis of proximity of human communities to panthers.
   Local papers published significantly more news articles and
   significantly longer news articles primarily about panthers. Articles in
   local and statewide papers used both episodic frames, which focus on
   specific occurrences (e.g., a panther sighting or predation) and
   thematic frames, which focus on general trends (e.g., abundance of
   panthers over time). Local articles more often emphasized risks that
   panthers might harm people, pets, or livestock than statewide papers.
   Our results are consistent with theory that proximity to humancarnivore
   conflict influences perceptions and salience of risks posed by large
   carnivores. Most articles mentioned panthers as a secondary topic, which
   we believe was a result of the relevance an endangered carnivore has in
   discussions of public land management, development, and regulations in
   Florida. Claims made by sources quoted in each article had a neutral to
   positive depiction of panthers, and most quotations were from federal
   and state agency scientists. We suggest continued use by the media of
   agency sources provides the opportunity for clear, concordant messages
   about panther management. Content analysis provides a way to monitor
   media portrayal of carnivores for consistency with agency outreach
   goals.},

Title = {Effects of climate on salmonid productivity: A global meta-analysis

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Salmonids are of immense socio-economic importance in much of the world,
   but are threatened by climate change. This has generated a substantial
   literature documenting the effects of climate variation on salmonid
   productivity in freshwater ecosystems, but there has been no global
   quantitative synthesis across studies. We conducted a systematic review
   and meta-analysis to gain quantitative insight into key factors shaping
   the effects of climate on salmonid productivity, ultimately collecting
   1321 correlations from 156 studies, representing 23 species across 24
   countries. Fisher's Z was used as the standardized effect size, and a
   series of weighted mixed-effects models were compared to identify
   covariates that best explained variation in effects. Patterns in climate
   effects were complex and were driven by spatial (latitude, elevation),
   temporal (time-period, age-class), and biological (range, habitat type,
   anadromy) variation within and among study populations. These trends
   were often consistent with predictions based on salmonid thermal
   tolerances. Namely, warming and decreased precipitation tended to reduce
   productivity when high temperatures challenged upper thermal limits,
   while opposite patterns were common when cold temperatures limited
   productivity. Overall, variable climate impacts on salmonids suggest
   that future declines in some locations may be counterbalanced by gains
   in others. In particular, we suggest that future warming should (1)
   increase salmonid productivity at high latitudes and elevations
   (especially >60 degrees and >1500 m), (2) reduce productivity in
   populations experiencing hotter and dryer growing season conditions, (3)
   favor non-native over native salmonids, and (4) impact lentic
   populations less negatively than lotic ones. These patterns should help
   conservation and management organizations identify populations most
   vulnerable to climate change, which can then be prioritized for
   protective measures. Our framework enables broad inferences about future
   productivity that can inform decision-making under climate change for
   salmonids and other taxa, but more widespread, standardized, and
   hypothesis-driven research is needed to expand current knowledge.},

Abstract = {A number of modeling approaches have been developed to predict the
   impacts of climate change on species distributions, performance, and
   abundance. The stronger the agreement from models that represent
   different processes and are based on distinct and independent sources of
   information, the greater the confidence we can have in their
   predictions. Evaluating the level of confidence is particularly
   important when predictions are used to guide conservation or restoration
   decisions. We used a multi-model approach to predict climate change
   impacts on big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), the dominant plant
   species on roughly 43 million hectares in the western United States and
   a key resource for many endemic wildlife species. To evaluate the
   climate sensitivity of A. tridentata, we developed four predictive
   models, two based on empirically derived spatial and temporal
   relationships, and two that applied mechanistic approaches to simulate
   sagebrush recruitment and growth. This approach enabled us to produce an
   aggregate index of climate change vulnerability and uncertainty based on
   the level of agreement between models. Despite large differences in
   model structure, predictions of sagebrush response to climate change
   were largely consistent. Performance, as measured by change in cover,
   growth, or recruitment, was predicted to decrease at the warmest sites,
   but increase throughout the cooler portions of sagebrush's range. A
   sensitivity analysis indicated that sagebrush performance responds more
   strongly to changes in temperature than precipitation. Most of the
   uncertainty in model predictions reflected variation among the
   ecological models, raising questions about the reliability of forecasts
   based on a single modeling approach. Our results highlight the value of
   a multimodel approach in forecasting climate change impacts and
   uncertainties and should help land managers to maximize the value of
   conservation investments.},

Title = {Domestic calf mortality and producer detection rates in the Mexican wolf
   recovery area: Implications for livestock management and carnivore
   compensation schemes},

Volume = {144},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Conserving large carnivores throughout the world will often require that
   they share the landscape with livestock. Minimizing depredations and
   increasing tolerance by livestock producers will be critical for
   conservation efforts. To investigate factors influencing calf mortality
   and producer detection rates (i.e., number of livestock killed by
   predators, found by producers, and correctly classified as to cause of
   death), we monitored radio-tagged domestic calves at two sites in the
   Mexican wolf recovery area (East Eagle {[}EE] and Adobe Ranch {[}AR]).
   Study areas differed in grazing practices, density of predators
   (mountain lions, black bears, coyotes, and Mexican wolves), and amount
   of effort spent monitoring cattle. We radiotagged 618 calves over 3.5
   years, and 312 calves over 2 years on the EE and AR, respectively. The
   overall proportion of radioed calves that died was higher on the EE
   (6.5\%) than on the AR (1.9\%). Predators (especially mountain lions)
   accounted for 85\% of mortality on the EE and 0\% on the AR. Calves
   selected by predators were on average 25 days younger than the surviving
   cohort. Our results indicate that year-round calving, especially in
   areas with high predator densities, are subject to higher losses
   primarily because calves are exposed to mortality agents for longer
   periods of time rather than having higher natural rates of mortality. We
   found a significant difference in producer detection rates between study
   sites, likely due to differences in the intensity of monitoring cattle
   between sites. On the EE, the producer detected 77.5\% of mortalities
   and on the AR, the producer detected 33\% of mortalities. Our results
   support changing husbandry practices to limit calving to a seasonal
   endeavor and that performance payment may be a better compensation
   strategy than ex post compensation schemes. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The geography of the Black Hills region of South Dakota and Wyoming may
   limit connectivity for many species. For species with large energetic
   demands and large home ranges or species at low densities this can
   create viability concerns. Carnivores in this region, such as cougars
   (Puma concolor), have the additive effect of natural and human-induced
   mortality; this may act to decrease long-term viability. In this study
   we set out to explore genetic diversity among cougar populations in the
   Black Hills and surrounding areas. Specifically, our objectives were to
   first compare genetic variation and effective number of breeders of
   cougars in the Black Hills during three harvest regimes: pre
   (2003-2006), moderate (2007-2010), and heavy (2011-2013), to determine
   if harvest impacted genetic variation. Second, we compared genetic
   structure of the Black Hills cougar population with cougar populations
   in neighboring eastern Wyoming and North Dakota. Using 20 microsatellite
   loci, we conducted genetic analysis on DNA samples from cougars in the
   Black Hills (n = 675), North Dakota (n = 113), and eastern Wyoming (n =
   62) collected from 2001-2013. Here we report that the Black Hills cougar
   population maintained genetic variation over the three time periods. Our
   substructure analysis suggests that the maintenance of genetic variation
   was due to immigration from eastern Wyoming and possibly North Dakota.},

Abstract = {Disease surveillance in wildlife is rapidly expanding in scope and
   methodology, emphasizing the need for formal evaluations of system
   performance. We examined a syndromic surveillance system for respiratory
   disease detection in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, from 2004 to 2012,
   with respect to data quality, disease trends, and respiratory disease
   detection. Data quality was assessed by examining community coverage,
   completeness, and consistency. The data were examined for baseline
   trends; signs of respiratory disease occurred at a mean frequency of
   less than 1 case per week, with most weeks containing zero observations
   of abnormalities. Seasonal and secular (i.e., over a period of years)
   trends in respiratory disease frequency were not identified. These
   baselines were used to develop algorithms for outbreak detection using
   both weekly counts and weekly prevalence thresholds and then compared
   retrospectively on the detection of 13 respiratory disease clusters from
   2005 to 2012. Prospective application of outbreak detection algorithms
   to real-time syndromic data would be useful in triggering a rapid
   outbreak response, such as targeted diagnostic sampling, enhanced
   surveillance, or mitigation.},

   numbers of infrastructural features may limit genetic exchange among
   wildlife populations. Yet, whether this results in genetic
   differentiation among individuals in different habitat fragments will
   depend on both the species studied and the composition of the landscape.
   European pine martens (Martes martes) show clear spatial structure at a
   Europe-wide scale, but whether gene flow among habitat patches can be
   maintained at a more local scale in intensively urbanized areas remained
   unclear. Here, we analysed genotypic data from 270 pine martens sampled
   from locations scattered across the Netherlands, one of the most densely
   populated areas in the world. Using Bayesian clustering models we show
   that most likely maximum two large subpopulations exist in the
   Netherlands. We observed relatively low levels of genetic
   differentiation and genetic evidence of regular long-distance dispersal
   by juveniles that must have crossed one or multiple major highways. Our
   results suggest that genetic exchange among Dutch pine martens has,
   until 2010, not been impacted severely by the countries' dense
   infrastructural network. Furthermore this species seems to have
   maintained its genetic diversity despite a recent demographic
   bottleneck. These conclusions support the idea that the effects of
   habitat fragmentation may strongly differ between (groups of) species,
   and that prioritization and optimization of management decisions thus
   requires direct study of the targeted species.},

Abstract = {Species reintroduction efforts can improve the recovery of imperiled
   species, but successful implementation of this conservation strategy
   requires a thorough understanding of the abiotic and biotic factors
   influencing species viability. Species interactions are especially
   understudied, in particular by omitting the effect of imperfect
   detection on negative, neutral, or positive associations within a
   community. Using repeat surveys from 5 southern Ontario, Canada, Great
   Lakes tributaries, we quantified species co-occurrence patterns with the
   eastern sand darter (ESD) (Ammocrypta pellucida), listed as federally
   threatened, and characterized how imperfect detection during sampling
   can influence inference regarding these relationships. We used a
   probabilistic framework that included 3 approaches of increasing
   complexity: probabilistic co-occurrence analysis ignoring imperfect
   detection; single-species occupancy models with subsequent co-occurrence
   analysis; and 2-species occupancy models. We then used our occupancy
   models to predict suitable sites for potential future reintroduction
   efforts while considering the influence of negative species
   interactions. Based on the observed data, ESD showed several positive
   associations with co-occurring species; however, species associations
   differed when imperfect detection was considered. Specifically, a
   negative association between ESD and rosyface shiner (Notropis rubellus)
   was observed only after accounting for imperfect detection in the Grand
   River. Alternatively, positive associations in the Grand River between
   ESD and northern hogsucker (Hypentelium nigricans) and silver shiner
   (Notropis photogenis) were observed regardless of whether imperfect
   detection was accounted for. Our models predicted several potential
   reintroduction sites for ESD in formerly occupied watersheds with high
   levels of certainty. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of
   investigating imperfect detection and species co-occurrence when
   planning reintroduction efforts.
   Article impact statement: Species co-occurrence patterns can be affected
   by imperfect detection and are an important consideration for species
   reintroduction.
   Caracterizacion de los Patrones de Coocurrencia de Especies de Peces de
   Arroyo Detectados Imperfectamente para Informar los Esfuerzos de
   Reintroduccion Los esfuerzos de reintroduccion pueden incrementar la
   recuperacion de las especies en peligro, pero la implementacion exitosa
   de esta estrategia de conservacion requiere de un entendimiento profundo
   de los factores bioticos y abioticos que influyen sobre la viabilidad de
   las especies. Las interacciones entre las especies estan especialmente
   sub-estudiadas, particularmente cuando se omite el efecto de la
   deteccion imperfecta sobre las asociaciones negativas, neutras o
   positivas dentro de una comunidad. Usamos censos repetidos tomados en
   cinco tributarios de los Grandes Lagos al sur de Ontario, Canada,
   cuantificamos los patrones de coocurrencia de especies con el pez
   Ammocrypta pellucida (eastern sand darter, ESD, en ingles), enlistado
   como amenazado a nivel federal, y caracterizamos como la deteccion
   imperfecta durante un muestreo puede influir sobre la inferencia con
   respecto a estas relaciones. Utilizamos un marco de trabajo
   probabilistico que incluia tres estrategias con una complejidad cada vez
   mayor: analisis probabilistico de coocurrencia ignorando la deteccion
   imperfecta; modelos de ocupacion de una sola especie con un analisis
   subsecuente de coocurrencia; y modelos de ocupacion de dos especies.
   Despues utilizamos nuestros modelos de ocupacion para predecir los
   sitios apropiados para futuros esfuerzos potenciales mientras
   consideramos la influencia de las interacciones negativas entre
   especies. Con base en los datos observados, los ESD mostraron varias
   asociaciones positivas con especies coocurrentes; sin embargo, las
   asociaciones entre especies difirieron cuando se considero la deteccion
   imperfecta. Especificamente, se observo una asociacion negativa entre
   los ESD y Notropis rubellus solo despues de considerar la deteccion
   imperfecta en el rio Grand. De manera alternativa, se observaron
   asociaciones positivas en el rio Grand entre los ESD y Hypentelium
   nigricans y Notropis photogenis sin importar si se considero o no la
   deteccion imperfecta. Nuestros modelos pronosticaron con altos niveles
   de certidumbre varios sitios potenciales de reintroduccion para los ESD
   en cuencas previamente ocupadas. En general, nuestros resultados
   demuestran la importancia de investigar la deteccion imperfecta y la
   coocurrencia de especies cuando se planean esfuerzos de reintroduccion.

Title = {Witnessing mass extinction: What?s invisible, what?s visible, what?s

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We are living in the time of the Sixth Mass Extinction. While many
   details elude us, we know that a mass extinction is underway from
   comparisons between background and current extinction rates, precipitous
   drops in wildlife populations, the shrinking of wild places, and the
   critical endangerment of biodiverse ecologies such as grasslands,
   tropical forests, wetlands, rivers and lakes, coral reefs, and
   continental shelves. This paper dissects the underpinnings of the Sixth
   Mass Extinction, with the intention of joining many other activists and
   thinkers to disrupt its seeming inevitability. First, I discuss what has
   been invisible about anthropogenic mass extinc-tion-the event itself-and
   the factors of silence, ignorance, and denial underlying its
   invisibility. Then I turn to the visible dimension of the Sixth Mass
   Extinction, namely, the action orientation of ``entitled
   instrumentalism{''} that is driving it; I describe entitled
   instrumentalism as the wholesale assimilation of the natural world into
   a human-owned domain. I end with considering the possibility of humanity
   charting an altogether different course. We must recognize mass
   extinction as the inevitable upshot of nature colonization and awaken to
   the need to restore and preserve Earth's cosmic wealth.},

Abstract = {Infectious diseases, in particular canine distemper virus (CDV), are an
   important threat to the viability of wild carnivore populations. CDV is
   thought to be transmitted by direct contact between individuals;
   therefore, the study of species interactions plays a pivotal role in
   understanding CDV transmission dynamics. However, CDV often appears to
   move between populations that are ecologically isolated, possibly
   through bridge hosts that interact with both species. This study
   investigated how an introduced species could alter multihost
   interactions and act as a bridge host in a novel carnivore assemblage of
   domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), invasive American mink (Neovison
   vison), and threatened river otters (Lontra provocax) in southern Chile.
   We found that rural dogs interact with mink near farms whereas in
   riparian habitats, minks and river otters shared the same latrines with
   both species visiting sites frequently within time intervals well within
   CDV environmental persistence. No interactions were observed between
   dogs and otters at either location. Both dog and mink populations were
   serologically positive for CDV, making the pathogen transfer risk to
   otters a conservation concern. Altogether, introduced mink in this
   ecosystem have the potential to act as bridge hosts between domestic
   dogs and endangered carnivores.},

Title = {FishResp: R package and GUI application for analysis of aquatic
   respirometry data},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {FishResp is a user-friendly tool for calculating oxygen uptake of
   aquatic organisms. The aim of the software is to improve the quality of
   metabolic rate estimates based on a straightforward pipeline: background
   respiration correction, detection of mechanical problems, conduction of
   QC tests, and filtration based on user-defined criteria.
   Abstract Intermittent-flow respirometry is widely used to measure oxygen
   uptake rates and subsequently estimate aerobic metabolic rates of
   aquatic animals. However, the lack of a standard quality-control
   software to detect technical problems represents a potential impediment
   to comparisons across studies in the field of evolutionary and
   conservation physiology. Here, we introduce FishResp', a versatile R
   package and its graphical implementation for quality-control and
   filtering of raw respirometry data. Our goal is to provide a
   straightforward, cross-platform and free software to help improve the
   quality and comparability of metabolic rate estimates for reducing
   methodological fragmentation in the field of aquatic respirometry.
   FishResp accepts data from various respirometry systems, allows users to
   detect potential mechanical problems which can occur during oxygen
   uptake measurements (e.g. chamber leaking, poor water circulation), and
   offers six options to correct raw data for microbial oxygen consumption.
   The software performs filtering of raw data based on user criteria, and
   produces accurate and unbiased estimates of absolute and mass-specific
   metabolic rates. Using data from three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus
   aculeatus) and Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), we demonstrate
   the virtues of FishResp, highlighting the importance of detecting
   mechanical problems and correcting measurements for background
   respiration.},

Abstract = {Fisheries provide livelihoods and income for many Indonesian communities
   and play a very important role in contributing to national economic
   development. However, excessive fishing effort, and destructive fishing
   methods can lead to less fish at sea, which in turn could adversely
   affect the life and livelihood of coastal communities. the role of
   coastal and marine ecosystem for human well-being tends to decrease
   every year. This is because of the weakness capacity of the country to
   manage retrieval of coral, sea sand mining, overfishing, pollution,
   urban development, conflict land uses and logging of mangrove. The
   coastal area is a main supporting the livelihood of fishermen. If
   coastal areas are degraded, then the fisherman's life is threatened.
   Therefore, It is very important to carry out conservation activities
   which address the issues of life of fishermen in the coastal region. The
   government of east java province has been trying to overcome the damage
   to coastal ecosystems with various package programs, such as
   rehabilitation mangrove, coral reef and sea grass. However, there have
   been no significant improvement progress in the coastal areas. The aim
   of this research is to formulate restoration strategies for integrated
   coastal ecosystem management to support the Indonesian policy called
   master plan for acceleration of economic development. It includes
   formulate restoration strategy based on restoration optimation. To
   formulate restoration optimation, an statistical approach is needed with
   assumption that restoration will consider the relationship between
   community participation and ecosystem restoration. PLS (Partial Least
   Square) is a method for constructing predictive models when the factors
   are many and highly collinear (Tobias 1995). In this research PLS was
   used to calculate the relationship between community participation and
   coastal ecosystem restoration. Whereas, to analyse the priority of which
   ecosystems should be prioritized to be solved, it is used AHP
   (Analytical Hierarchy Process). The results of this research finds that
   ecosystem restoration should involve community participation, government
   and private sector. To implement integrated coastal ecosystem
   restoration, a forum or institution is needed to realize such
   collaboration by considering the priority program should be prioritized
   begin from mangrove, coral reef, estuary to sea grass.},

   Olkiramatian and Shompole Group Ranches of Kenya's South Rift region,
   despite residence by pastoralist Maasai people and their sheep, goats,
   and cattle. We have previously found that these lions respond to
   seasonal movements of people by moving away from occupied settlements,
   shifting into denser habitats when people are nearby, and moving into a
   protected conservation area when people move into the adjacent buffer
   zone. Here, we examined lion stress responses to anthropogenic
   activities, using enzyme-linked immunoassay to measure the concentration
   of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in 136 samples collected from five
   lion groups over 2 years. Faecal glucocorticoid metabolite
   concentrations were significantly lower for lions in the conservation
   area than for lions in the human-settled buffer zone, and decreased
   significantly with increasing distance to the nearest occupied human
   settlement. Faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations were not
   detectably related to fine-scaled variation in prey or livestock
   density, and surprisingly, faecal glucocorticoid metabolite
   concentrations were higher in the wet season, when regional prey
   abundance was high. Lions coexist with people and livestock on this
   landscape by adjusting their movements, but they nonetheless mount an
   appreciable stress response when conditions do not allow them to
   maintain adequate separation. Thus, physiological data confirm
   inferences from prior data on lion movements and habitat use, showing
   that access to undisturbed and protected areas facilitates human-lion
   coexistence in a broader landscape that is used by people and livestock.},

Title = {An ethnobiological study in Kala Chitta hills of Pothwar region,
   Pakistan: multinomial logit specification},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Background: This paper constitutes an important ethnobiological survey
   in the context of utilizing biological resources by residents of Kala
   Chitta hills of Pothwar region, Pakistan. The fundamental aim of this
   research endeavour was to catalogue and analyse the indigenous knowledge
   of native community about plants and animals. The study is distinctive
   in the sense to explore both ethnobotanical and ethnozoological aspects
   of indigenous culture, and exhibits novelty, being based on empirical
   approach of Multinomial Logit Specifications (MLS) for examining
   ethnobotanical and ethnozoological uses of specific plants and animals.
   Methods: To document the ethnobiological knowledge, the survey was
   conducted during 2011-12 by employing a semi-structured questionnaire
   and thus 54 informants were interviewed. Plant and animal specimens were
   collected, photographed and properly identified. Distribution of plants
   and animals were explored by descriptive and graphical examination. MLS
   were further incorporated to identify the probability of occurrence of
   diversified utilization of plants and animals in multipurpose domains.
   Results: Traditional uses of 91 plant and 65 animal species were
   reported. Data analysis revealed more medicinal use of plants and
   animals than all other use categories. MLS findings are also in line
   with these proportional configurations. They reveal that medicinal and
   food consumption of underground and perennial plants was more as
   compared to aerial and annual categories of plants. Likewise, medicinal
   utilization of wild animals and domestic animals were more commonly
   observed as food items. However, invertebrates are more in the domain of
   medicinal and food utilization. Also carnivores are fairly common in the
   use of medicine while herbivores are in the category of food
   consumption.
   Conclusion: This study empirically scans a good chunk of ethnobiological
   knowledge and depicts its strong connection with indigenous traditions.
   It is important to make local residents beware of conservation status of
   species and authentication of this knowledge needs to be done in near
   future. Moreover, Statistically significant findings impart novelty in
   the existing literature in the field of ethnobiology. Future
   conservation, phytochemical and pharmacological studies are recommended
   on these identified plants and animals in order to use them in a more
   sustainable and effective way.},

Title = {Ecological status and traditional knowledge of medicinal plants in
   Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary of Garhwal Himalaya, India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Background: Himalayan forests are the most important source of medicinal
   plants and with useful species for the local people. Kedarnath Wildlife
   Sanctuary (KWLS) is situated in the interior part of the Garhwal
   Himalayan region. The presented study was carried out in Madhmeshwar
   area of KWLS for the ecological status of medicinal plants and further
   focused on the ethnomedicinal uses of these plants in the study area.
   Methods: Ecological information about ethnomedicinal plants were
   collected using random quadrats in a random sampling technique along an
   altitudinal gradient in the KWLS. Information on medicinal properties of
   plants encountered in the present study was generated by questionnaire
   survey and was also compared with relevant literature.
   Results: A total of 152 medicinally important plant species were
   reported, in which 103 were found herbs, 32 shrubs and 17 were tree
   species which represented 123 genera of 61 families. A total of 18 plant
   species fell into the rare, endangered (critically endangered) and
   vulnerable status categories.
   Conclusion: The present study documented the traditional uses of
   medicinal plants, their ecological status and importance of these plants
   in the largest protected area of Garhwal Himalaya. This study can serve
   as baseline information on medicinal plants and could be helpful to
   further strengthen the conservation of this important resource.},

Title = {How many sparrows are there in a city of million people? Understanding
   the population of sympatric sparrows in the urban gradient of a tropical

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {In cities, species have to endure severe biotic and abiotic changes in
   their surroundings, along with various anthropogenic pressures. In
   recent years, urban dwellers have declined throughout the world,
   including the most successful urban adapters- House Sparrow and Tree
   Sparrow. We studied how the population and habitat use of sparrows
   varied at different urban habitats (city outskirts, followed by
   residential and highly crowded commercial zones) of Guwahati, India. We
   carried out point counts using distance sampling to estimate the density
   of sparrows. We found that sparrows were largely associated with complex
   urban structures, and the density of sparrows significantly differed
   between species amongst the habitat. House Sparrow density was
   three-fold of Tree Sparrow, and the occurrence of both the species was
   highest at mid-level of urbanization. Tree sparrow had low density
   compared to House Sparrow in areas where urbanization peaked. Unlike
   Tree Sparrow, the habitat-specific detection for House Sparrow did not
   vary significantly. The detectability of Tree Sparrow was higher in
   residential buildings. The Manly Selectivity ratio for the preference
   and avoidance of different habitats showed that House Sparrows occupied
   commercial areas and a combination of commercial-residential sectors
   more than available and avoided areas with a low level of urbanization
   (city outskirts). Tree sparrows significantly preferred human habitation
   dominated by residential houses. We estimated around four hundred
   thousand sparrows (House Sparrow: 253,615-357,454; Tree Sparrow:
   32,882-163,533) in Guwahati. The present study creates a baseline
   information for the sparrow population and habitat use in Guwahati City,
   and provides emphasis for maintaining (mid-level urbanized) areas where
   both the species are abundant.},

Title = {Climate change impacts on the conservation outlook of populations on the
   poleward periphery of species ranges: A case study of Canadian
   black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus)},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {836-847},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Given climate change, species' climatically suitable habitats are
   increasingly expected to shift poleward. Some imperilled populations
   towards the poleward edge of their species' range might therefore
   conceivably benefit from climate change. Interactions between climate
   and population dynamics may be complex, however, with climate exerting
   effects both indirectly via influence over food availability and more
   directly, via effects on physiology and its implications for survival
   and reproduction. A thorough understanding of these interactions is
   critical for effective conservation management. We therefore examine the
   relationship between climate, survival and reproduction in Canadian
   black-tailed prairie dogs, a threatened keystone species in an
   imperilled ecosystem at the northern edge of the species' range. Our
   analyses considered 8 years of annual mark-recapture data (2007-2014) in
   relation to growing degree days, precipitation, drought status and
   winter severity, as well as year, sex, age and body mass. Survival was
   strongly influenced by the interaction of drought and body mass class,
   and winter temperature severity. Female reproductive status was
   associated with the interaction of growing degree days and growing
   season precipitation, with spring precipitation and with winter
   temperature severity. Results related to body mass suggested that
   climatic variables exerted their effects via regulation of food
   availability with potential linked effects of food quality,
   immunological and behavioural implications, and predation risk.
   Predictions of future increases in drought conditions in North America's
   grassland ecosystems have raised concerns for the outlook of Canadian
   black-tailed prairie dogs. Insights gained from the analyses, however,
   point to mitigating species management options targeted at decoupling
   the mechanisms by which climate exerts its negative influence. Our
   approach highlights the importance of understanding the interaction
   between climate and population dynamics in peripheral populations whose
   viability might ultimately determine their species' ability to track
   climatically suitable space.},

   whales to seek higher latitudes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate impacts affect marine ecosystems worldwide with island nations
   such as New Zealand being extremely vulnerable because of their
   socio-economic and cultural dependence on the marine and costal
   environment. Cetaceans are ideal indicator species of ecosystem change
   and ocean health given their extended life span and cosmopolitan
   distribution, but limited data availability prevents anticipating change
   in distribution under future climate changes. We projected the range
   shifts of a key odontocete and mysticete species (Physeter macrocephalus
   and Balaenoptera musculus) in 2100 relative to present day in New
   Zealand waters, using an ensemble modelling approach, under three
   climate change scenarios of different severity.The results show a
   latitudinal shift in suitable habitat for both whale species, increasing
   in magnitude with severity of sea surface temperature warming. The most
   severe climate change scenario tested generated 61\% and 42\% loss and
   decrease of currently suitable habitat for sperm and blue whales,
   respectively, mostly in New Zealand's northern waters. These predicted
   changes will have a strong impact on the ecosystem functioning and
   services in New Zealand's northern waters but also in coastal areas
   (critical for the species' foraging and sur-vival). Not only do these
   simulated range shifts help to identify future potential climate refugia
   to mitigate a global warming, they also generate a range of
   socioeconomic consequences for island nations relying on wildlife
   tourism, industry, and environmental protection.},

Abstract = {Dispersal is a key process for the maintenance of intraspecific genetic
   diversity by ensuring gene flow within and between populations. Despite
   the ongoing expansion of large carnivores in Europe, lynx populations
   remain fragmented, isolated, and threatened by inbreeding and loss of
   genetic diversity. In the course of large carnivore monitoring in the
   Czech Republic, several biological samples of Eurasian lynx were
   collected outside the permanent occurrence of this species. Using
   microsatellite genotyping we identified these as four dispersing lynx
   males and applied multiple methods (Bayesian clustering in STRUCTURE,
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA), frequency-based method in
   GENECLASS2, and machine-learning framework in assignPOP) to assign them
   to possible source populations. For this we used genotypes from five
   European lynx populations: the Bohemian-Bavarian-Austrian (N = 36),
   Carpathian (N = 43), Scandinavian (N = 20), Baltic (N = 15), and Harz (N
   = 23) population. All four dispersers were successfully assigned to
   different source populations within Europe and each was recorded at a
   distance of more than 98 km from the edge of the distribution of the
   source population identified. Such movements are among the longest
   described for lynx in Central Europe to this point. The findings
   indicate the ability of lynx males to disperse in human-dominated
   landscape thus facilitation of these movements via creation and/or
   protection of potential migratory corridors together with protection of
   dispersing individuals should be of high importance in conservation of
   this iconic predator in Central Europe.},

Title = {Tree growth indicates resource quality for foliage-feeding insects:
   Pattern and structure of herbivore diversity in response to productivity},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {249-259},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In forests, local site conditions can affect both trees and herbivores
   and hence site-related factors act indirectly on herbivores mediated by
   tree growth rates. Here, tree foliage represents a fundamental
   prerequisite for insect herbivore development providing energy in the
   form of plant tissue quality. Resource-based theories, on the other
   hand, assume that the synthesis of defensive compounds is a trade-off
   with growth and peaks at low resource availability. However, the extent
   to which plant tissue quality in response to site productivity is
   relevant in the species-energy relationship is unknown. Therefore, we
   aimed at a better understanding of the form and structure of the
   species-energy relationship in forest insects. We used census data of
   foliage-feeding insects along a productivity gradient of Scots pine
   forests defined by relative growth rates of trees (RGR). As a result,
   diversity monotonically increases with decreasing RGR (as a proxy for
   energy) during almost two decades of sampling. Herbivore assemblages
   become more similar with available energy as species turnover linearly
   decreases and proportions of sites occupied by individual species rise.
   The results suggest that tree growth rate influences herbivore dynamics
   in this system by altering the chemical composition of needles, without
   necessarily affecting the form in the relationship. The site-specific
   resource availability requires trees to adjust their allocation to
   synthesis of carbon-based secondary metabolites or growth, which then
   results in fundamental differences in herbivore dynamics at low vs.
   lowest RGR (regular cycles (dominance) vs. dampened cycles (evenness)).
   However, these differences inevitably demonstrate that species richness
   is not necessarily a result of more individuals and implicate that
   different mechanisms are involved (facilitation vs. competition/temporal
   heterogeneity). The resulting pattern and structure of foliage-feeding
   insects advance our understanding of herbivore dynamics in response to
   site quality and tree growth, which may ultimately improve our knowledge
   of plant-insect interactions in the face of environmental change.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances are a major concern for the welfare and
   conservation of wildlife. We recorded heart rate and body temperature of
   20 free-living greylag geese in response to a major regularly
   re-occurring anthropogenic disturbance-New Year's Eve fireworks. Heart
   rate and body temperature were significantly higher in the first and
   second hour of the new year, compared with the same hour on the 31st of
   December, the average during December and the average during January.
   Heart rate and body temperature was not significantly affected by sex or
   age. From 0200 to 0300 onwards, 1st of January heart rates did not
   significantly differ from the other periods; however, body temperatures
   were significantly increased until 0300-0400. From 0400 to 0500, heart
   rate was not affected by any of the investigated factors, whereas body
   temperature was significantly increased on the 1st of January compared
   with the 31st of December and the December average but not compared with
   the January average. To conclude, our results show that New Year's Eve
   fireworks cause a substantial physiological response, indicative of a
   stress response in greylag geese, which is costly in terms of energy
   expenditure.},

Abstract = {Societal Impact Statement
   Yosemite National Park, California, USA has hundreds of apple trees in
   orchards that were planted in the 1800s by local settlers. These
   orchards played a cultural role in the early history of the land that
   was to become a national park. Most of Yosemite's orchards are well over
   one hundred years old and have reached the end of their lifespan.
   Genetic data has facilitated the assignment of cultivar names to
   historic apple trees within Yosemite and this information will be used
   to develop an Orchard Management Plan. Yosemite will use this Plan to
   balance orchard conservation with other necessities such as reducing
   human-wildlife conflict from bears that enter developed areas to consume
   fruit from the trees.
   Summary
   Yosemite National Park, California, USA has hundreds of historic apple
   trees that were planted within orchards in the 1800s, prior to the
   establishment of the park. These apple trees have been a concern within
   Yosemite for decades because their fruit attracts bears and other
   wildlife into visitor recreation areas, causing undesirable
   wildlife-human interactions. Herein, 361 of Yosemite's apple trees were
   genotyped to determine cultivar identities. The cultivar names of 117
   apple trees were identified by matching genotypic data with genetic data
   available for an apple cultivar reference dataset for the United States
   Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS)
   National Plant Germplasm System as well as collections maintained by
   other sources. An additional 92 trees were determined to be likely
   cultivars because they matched genotypes in a reference set of trees
   whose identities are not known. A total of 152 trees had unique
   genotypes that did not match reference datasets. Cultivar information,
   made possible by having digital genetic information available, will
   allow for the preparation of a more comprehensive Orchard Management
   Plan. As such, park managers will be able use the Plan to more
   effectively make decisions about balancing orchard conservation with
   other park necessities, including eliminating the human-wildlife
   conflict that results from bears entering developed areas to feed on the
   fruit trees.},

Title = {Black widow spiders in an urban desert: Population variation in an
   arthropod pest across metropolitan Phoenix, AZ},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {599-609},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The effects of urban disturbance are critical to understand, as the
   majority of the world's population now resides in urban centers. For
   example, urbanization often leads to reduced species diversity at the
   expense of a few urban-adapted taxa. However, it remains unclear why
   some taxa thrive following human disturbance whereas others do poorly.
   The western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, thrives in
   disturbed, urban habitat-often forming dense aggregations (i.e.,
   infestations) relative to typical low-density, desert populations. We
   examined the population dynamics of ten black widow aggregations spread
   across metropolitan Phoenix, AZ, during the peak of the breeding season
   (June-August). Here we show that prey abundance, female mass, web volume
   and population density exhibit minimal temporal variation across the
   breeding season, but that prey abundance, female mass and population
   density show significant spatial variation across the ten urban
   aggregations. Our measure of prey abundance and foraging success, the
   number of prey carcasses found in black widow webs, shared a strong
   positive relationship with female mass and population density, but not
   with web volume. Surprisingly, female mass, web volume and population
   density were not correlated with each other. The abiotic variables we
   measured at each site did a poor job of explaining black widow
   population parameters, although we did find a marginal trend for more
   recent developments to harbor denser black widow aggregations. Our
   findings support the generalization that urbanization heightens spatial
   variation, and we suggest that local urban prey abundance is influential
   in promoting urban infestations full of heavy, fecund female black
   widows. Studies of the population ecology of urban pests are necessary
   to identify the mechanisms allowing some species to thrive following
   human disturbance while much native biodiversity is lost following
   urbanization.},

Abstract = {The golden jackal and red fox are among the wildlife species protected
   by Israeli law as enforced by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. In
   1964, as a part of a management program to control rabies in Israel, a
   poison eradication campaign was launched to exterminate golden jackals,
   considered to be the main reservoir of the disease. The program resulted
   in the near-complete extermination of jackals in Israel, while foxes
   were only mildly affected. Jackals have since regained their original
   numbers and have recolonized southern Israel. We here examined the
   population structure of the golden jackal and red fox in Israel, 48
   years after the poison eradication campaign. DNA from 88 golden jackals
   and 89 red foxes representing five different geographic regions was
   extracted and amplified at 13 microsatellite loci in order to
   characterize the populations on a genetic level. High genetic diversity
   was found among the jackal and fox populations. A possible migration
   route through the Jordan Rift Valley was suggested for both species by
   the genetic similarity of populations in northern and southern Israel.
   However, in both species, the animals from the center of Israel were
   distinctive from those north or south, indicating the relative isolation
   of central populations, likely due to fragmentation or a high abundance
   of food resources. Genetic profiles obtained for the golden jackal and
   the red fox in Israel may aid in their conservation management and in
   the study of zoonotic diseases.},

Title = {Could more efficient utilization of ecosystem services improve soil
   quality indicators to allow sustainable intensification of Amazonian
   family farming?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {127},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the Amazonian periphery, there are sources of numerous disservices,
   including deforestation, loss of wildlife habitat and biodiversity
   erosion. However, there are great opportunities to adopt appropriate
   agricultural management practices to take advantage of the benefits of
   ecosystem services for sustainable agricultural intensification. Thus,
   the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of certain ecosystem
   services provided by combined use of legumes with residue of low- and
   high-quality on soil quality indicators, nitrogen use efficiency and
   sustainability of maize grain yield in infertile tropical soil. The
   overarching objective is to determine how ecosystem services can
   contribute to the improvement of land-use policy to ensure the
   sustainability of cultivated lands, in such a way that forest can be
   preserved by avoiding deforestation of other new areas through shifting
   cultivation systems. Four leguminous tree species were used, two with
   high-quality residues Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) and Gliricidia
   sepium (gliricidia) and two with low-quality residues Clitoria
   fairchildiana (clitoria) and Acacia mangium (acacia). Maize grain yield
   was evaluated between 2011 and 2017 in these treatments. In 2018, to
   assess how ecosystem services affect crop performance, the treatments
   were divided into ten treatments with and without urea. We conclude that
   increased uptake of inorganic and organic N by maize resulting from
   improvement of the soil quality indicators may allow agricultural
   intensification. This improvement can help meet the challenges of
   sustainability and feasibility of agroecosystems of the Amazonian
   periphery by making the agroecosystem more productive year by year.
   Therefore, our results confirm that the utilization of an ecosystem
   services style approach can help meet the challenges of sustainability
   and feasibility in agrosystems of the Amazonian periphery. In addition,
   these results can contribute to the development of land-use policy in
   the Amazonian periphery, aiming for the intensification of agriculture
   in cropped areas to avoid deforestation of new areas from shifting
   cultivation systems.},

Title = {Effects of genomic homozygosity on total fitness in an invertebrate:
   lethal equivalent estimates for Drosophila melanogaster},
Journal = {CONSERVATION GENETICS},
Abstract = {Estimates of susceptibility to inbreeding depression for total fitness
   are needed for predicting the cost of inbreeding and for use in
   population viability analyses, but no such valid estimates are available
   for any wild invertebrate population. I estimated the number of lethals
   equivalents for total fitness in recently wild-caught populations of
   Drosophila melanogaster using published data on the total fitness of
   homozygosity versus heterozygosity for each of the major chromosomes
   (the X, second, and third) under competitive conditions. As there are no
   data for the fitness effects of homozygosity for the small fourth
   chromosome which represents 1.0\% of the euchromatic genome, this was
   accounted for by attributing the homozygosity for the three large
   chromosome to an inbreeding coefficient of 0.99 when computing lethal
   equivalents for total fitness. Total genomic homozygosity is predicted
   to be essentially lethal in D. melanogaster. The corresponding haploid
   lethal equivalents estimate for total fitness was 5.04. The lethal
   equivalent value lies within the range for vertebrates but tends to be
   higher than for most outbreeding plants which are often purged as they
   exhibit up to 20\% selfing (by definition). As D. melanogaster has its
   genome sequenced and annotated and has lethal equivalent estimates for
   total fitness for individual chromosomes as well as its total genome, it
   provides an excellent opportunity for evaluating genomic estimates of
   mutation load.},

Title = {Assessing genotyping errors in mammalian museum study skins using

Journal = {CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The use of museum specimens held in natural history repositories for
   population and conservation genetic research is increasing in tandem
   with the use of massively parallel sequencing technologies. Short Tandem
   Repeats (STRs), or microsatellite loci, are commonly used genetic
   markers in wildlife and population genetic studies. However, they
   traditionally suffered from a host of issues including length homoplasy,
   high costs, low throughput, and difficulties in reproducibility across
   laboratories. Massively parallel sequencing technologies can address
   these problems, but the incorporation of museum specimen derived DNA
   suffers from significant fragmentation and exogenous DNA contamination.
   Combatting these issues requires extra measures of stringency in the lab
   and during data analysis, yet there have not been any high-throughput
   sequencing studies evaluating microsatellite allelic dropout from museum
   specimen extracted DNA. In this study, we evaluate genotyping errors
   derived from mammalian museum skin DNA extracts for previously
   characterized microsatellites across PCR replicates utilizing
   high-throughput sequencing. We found it useful to classify samples based
   on DNA concentration, which determined the rate by which genotypes were
   accurately recovered. Longer microsatellites performed worse in all
   museum specimens. Allelic dropout rates across loci were dependent on
   sample quantity, with high concentration museum specimens performing as
   well and recovering quality metrics nearly as high as the frozen tissue
   sample. Based on our results, we provide a set of best practices for
   quality assurance and incorporation of reliable genotypes from museum
   specimens.},

Title = {Diurnal habitat selection of migrating Whooping Crane in the Great
   Plains},
Journal = {AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Available stopover habitats with quality foraging opportunities are
   essential for migrating waterbirds, including Whooping Crane (Grus
   americana). Several studies have evaluated habitats used by Whooping
   Crane for roosting throughout its migration corridor; however, habitats
   associated with foraging and other diurnal activities have received less
   attention. We used data collected from 42 Whooping Crane individuals
   that included 2169 diurnal use locations within 395 stopover sites
   evaluated during spring 2013 to fall 2015 to assess diurnal habitat
   selection throughout the U.S. portion of the migration corridor. We
   found that Whooping Crane selected wetland land-cover types (i.e., open
   water, riverine, and semipermanent wetlands) and lowland grasslands for
   diurnal activities over all other land-cover types that we evaluated,
   including croplands. Whooping Crane generally avoided roads, and
   avoidance varied based on land-cover class. There has been considerable
   alteration and destruction of natural wetlands and rivers that serve as
   roosting and foraging sites for migrating Whooping Crane. Given recent
   droughts and the likelihood of future landscape changes within the
   migration corridor, directing conservation efforts toward protecting and
   enhancing wetland stopover areas may prove critical for continued growth
   of the last remaining wild population of Whooping Crane. Future studies
   of this Whooping Crane population should focus on specific wetland
   complexes and riverine sites throughout the migration corridor to
   identify precise management actions that could be taken to enhance and
   protect these imperilled land-cover types.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Atlantic Forest is an intensely fragmented and globally important
   ecological hotspot. In this context, the objective of this study was to
   analyze the landscape ecology and submit proposals for creating
   ecological corridors (ECs) in a Brazilian Atlantic Forest region.
   Landscape ecology metrics, based on the forest fragments map, were used
   for the analysis. Suggested corridors were based on least-cost path
   analysis, considering land use, declivity, permanent preservation areas
   (PPM), and forest fragment sizes. Although the predominant class sizes
   in the study area are small fragments, landscape ecology analysis has
   shown good environmental quality for fragments larger than 100 ha that
   do not lose their central area, even for the largest edge distances.
   Four ECs were proposed, with an average length of 53.86 km, average
   width of 5.39 km, and average area of 28,786.32 ha. Land use conflicts
   showed that the fragments within the corridors were situated in a matrix
   dominated by grassland. PPM within the proposed corridors were dominated
   by misused land and did not comply with environmental legislation. The
   proposed corridors were efficient in using the largest fragments, which
   have the least edge effect and provide necessary support for most
   wildlife. However, we emphasize that other factors can influence the
   delimiting of ECs; additional studies are required to obtain more
   effective ECs to connect habitats. The proposed methodology can be
   applied to other Brazilian and global ecoregion.},

   habitat connectivity is one of the major factors influencing species'
   persistence in fragmented landscapes. We explore the consequences of
   recent habitat fragmentation on volcanoes across Isabela Island,
   Galapagos by analyzing genetic patterns of populations of endemic
   weevils whose host plants have been depleted by indiscriminate goat
   grazing. We predicted that if grazing on the weevils' host plants has
   caused habitat fragmentation on the weevils populations themselves, then
   the effects on the genetic architecture of populations should be more
   severe on Galapaganus conwayensis populations from volcanoes on Northern
   Isabela than on those from Santa Cruz or Pinta islands where vegetation
   destruction was not as extensive. We used mitochondrial sequences to
   reveal historical colonization patterns and microsatellite variation to
   understand more contemporary genetic changes. We found significantly
   lower microsatellite genetic diversity and population size within
   localities and increased genetic differentiation at a small geographic
   scale with a stronger isolation by distance pattern and larger numbers
   of genetic clusters on Isabela. In the absence of long-standing
   mitochondrial structure within each volcano, we interpret the
   microsatellite results as suggesting that recent host plant habitat
   fragmentation may indeed influence the genetic patterns of plant feeding
   insects and highlight the importance of controlling the spread of
   introduced herbivores in the Galapagos Islands.},

Abstract = {Increasing air temperatures are changing the arctic tundra biome.
   Permafrost is thawing, snow duration is decreasing, shrub vegetation is
   proliferating, and boreal wildlife is encroaching. Here we present
   evidence of the recent range expansion of North American beaver (Castor
   canadensis) into the Arctic, and consider how this ecosystem engineer
   might reshape the landscape, biodiversity, and ecosystem processes. We
   developed a remote sensing approach that maps formation and
   disappearance of ponds associated with beaver activity. Since 1999, 56
   new beaver pond complexes were identified, indicating that beavers are
   colonizing a predominantly tundra region (18,293km(2)) of northwest
   Alaska. It is unclear how improved tundra stream habitat, population
   rebound following overtrapping for furs, or other factors are
   contributing to beaver range expansion. We discuss rates and likely
   routes of tundra beaver colonization, as well as effects on permafrost,
   stream ice regimes, and freshwater and riparian habitat. Beaver ponds
   and associated hydrologic changes are thawing permafrost. Pond formation
   increases winter water temperatures in the pond and downstream, likely
   creating new and more varied aquatic habitat, but specific biological
   implications are unknown. Beavers create dynamic wetlands and are agents
   of disturbance that may enhance ecosystem responses to warming in the
   Arctic.},

Abstract = {Successful carnivore conservation depends on public attitudes and
   acceptance levels of carnivores, and these are likely to change as
   circumstances change. Attitude studies repeated in time that can
   demonstrate such change are rare. Our study surveyed Croatian rural
   inhabitants in 2002 and in 2008 and analyzed their responses to detect a
   change in attitudes toward brown bears (Ursus arctos) over time.
   Important developments occurring in Croatia at the time of our research
   included a more centralized and more clearly defined bear management
   strategy, and an increase in the bear population. We constructed models
   to explain respondent's value orientations, their level of perceived
   threat and their acceptance capacity for bears. Findings show that while
   value orientations and the overall level of perceived threat did not
   change over time, bear acceptance capacity was reduced. This suggests
   that the increase in the bear population and perhaps the more
   centralized bear management reduced respondents' willingness to accept a
   larger bear population. We conclude that continuous public involvement
   in bear management is essential in order to maintain a feeling of
   control over the bear among the local population. Furthermore we argue
   that hunting is an important form of public involvement in the region,
   serving to reinforce existence and bequest values of the bear and
   increase its public acceptance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {The role of psychology in determining human-predator conflict across

Abstract = {Conflict between people and carnivores can lead to the widespread
   killing of predators in retaliation for livestock loss and is a major
   threat to predator populations. In Kenya, a large, rural, pastoralist
   population comes into regular conflict with predators, which persist
   across southern Kenya. We explored the social and psychological backdrop
   to livestock management practices in this area in a process designed to
   be easy to use and suitable for use across large areas for the study of
   conflict and transboundary implementation of wildlife conflict reduction
   measures, focusing on community involvement and needs. We carried out
   fully structured interviews of livestock managers with a survey tool
   that examined how social and psychological factors may influence
   livestock management behavior. We compared survey responses on 3 sites
   across the study area, resulting in 723 usable responses. Efficacy of
   individuals' livestock management varied between and within communities.
   This variation was partially explained by normative and control beliefs
   regarding livestock management. Individual livestock managers'
   self-reported management issues were often an accurate reflection of
   their practical management difficulties. Psychological norms, control
   beliefs, and attitudes differed among sites, and these differences
   partially explained patterns associated with conflict (i.e., variation
   in livestock management behavior). Thus, we conclude that a
   one-size-fits-all approach to improving livestock management and
   reducing human-predator conflict is not suitable.},

Title = {Indigenous knowledge of zootherapeutic use among the Biate tribe of Dima
   Hasao District, Assam, Northeastern India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {Background: The present study addresses the use of zootherapy in the
   traditional healthcare system of the Biate tribe of Dima Hasao district,
   Assam, India. It sought to identify the different species used for
   zootherapeutic use with the detailed methods of usages to create
   awareness and contribute to the conservation and sustainable utilization
   of the resources.
   Method: 15 Biate villages within the district of Dima Hasao were
   surveyed through semi-structured questionnaires and informal interviews.
   Detailed information on the uses of each animal was recorded. Species
   were identified using standard literature. Fidelity level (FL) was
   calculated to demonstrate the percentage of respondents claiming the use
   of a certain animal for the same major purposes.
   Result: The study documents 34 species for the treatment of about 34
   different ailments. The largest number of species reported was mammals
   with17 species. Maximum number of species has been reported for the
   treatment of diabetes and its high fidelity levels warrants in-depth
   studies to establish its pharmacological activity. The usages documented
   herein are unique to the Biate tribe. Very often, these animals are
   hunted and sold openly at the local markets in the lure of quick money.
   A 300 gm live Gekko gecko may fetch a sum of 2,50,000 Indian Rupees
   (INR), and smoked meat of Hoolock hoolock cost approximately 250-300 INR
   per kg. Animals are also hunted for its hide. The unrestricted hunting
   of species like Capricornis sumatraensis has almost wiped out the
   population within the district. Some species are also reared as pets
   while some are used for display as a sign of expertise in hunting. The
   present study has documented the usage of at least 15 animals listed in
   the IUCN Red List.
   Conclusion: The study illustrates the in-depth knowledge of the Biate
   tribe on zootherapy. Systematic investigation to identify the active
   ingredient may lead to the development of new drugs, which would prompt
   protection of these valuable resources.},

Abstract = {Australia's natural temperate grasslands have diminished to 0.5 \% of
   their former area since European settlement and, as a consequence, are
   highly fragmented and modified. Many vertebrate species that live in
   temperate grasslands are habitat specialists and therefore are at risk
   of decline through habitat loss and fragmentation. The grassland earless
   dragon (Tympanocryptis pinguicolla) is one such species. Once
   widespread, T. pinguicolla is now restricted to two general locations;
   the first is near Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory
   (including some adjacent land near Queanbeyan), and the second is the
   Monaro Tablelands in New South Wales. Here, we use microsatellite DNA
   data collected from the largest remaining populations near Canberra to
   examine genetic structure in this species in the context of the rapidly
   expanding urban landscape in this region. Our study revealed that,
   despite separation by only relatively small distances (largest distance
   similar to 13 km), the T. pinguicolla populations are highly genetically
   structured with little admixture. Our analyses also revealed that the
   population with the largest census size, but which has recently crashed
   in population size, exhibited little detectable gene flow to other
   populations and is essentially isolated. Our data indicate that
   significant barriers to dispersal exist among the remaining T.
   pinguicolla populations and that management of this species cannot rely
   on natural dispersal to bolster declining populations. Many different
   agencies and landholders are responsible for the protection of these
   remnant populations and a co-ordinated effort is required to provide
   reasonable confidence that the species will persist.},

Title = {American Oystercatcher benefits from a heterogeneous landscape to breed

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-100},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Urbanization is a major form of landscape transformation that often
   results in habitat degradation and loss for birds. However, effects on
   avian populations are trait- and context-dependent, and persistence at
   urban patches is likely to be a function of habitat availability at the
   landscape scale. Here, we aimed to assess the breeding performance and
   foraging ecology of a widespread shorebird, the American Oystercatcher
   Haematopus palliatus, during the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 breeding
   seasons at a small urban beach surrounded by a heterogeneous landscape
   in southern Brazil. Twelve pairs were able to breed consistently and
   successfully fledge offspring in 20\% of nesting attempts at the urban
   site, with overall productivity of 0.37 fledglings per pair. Food
   remains collected within seven successful nesting territories and stable
   isotope analysis in blood samples of adults and chicks indicated that
   oystercatchers relied on invertebrates from both sandy beaches and rocky
   shores as food resources. Furthermore, eight out of 21 color-marked
   individuals from the urban beach were consistently recorded using an
   insular marine protected area 2 km offshore, revealing a connection
   between unprotected and protected habitat patches. Although
   oystercatchers had to perform multiple foraging trips in order to
   collect food, the ability to explore different environments in the
   landscape may be critical in the region, especially with human
   disturbance at its peak on beaches during the summer. Our findings
   suggest that shorebirds breeding in urban areas may rely on
   heterogeneous landscapes, where distinct and protected habitat patches
   can provide complementary resources that allow breeding successfully.},

Title = {College squirrels gone wild? Using Sciurus carolinensis behavior to
   assess the ecosystem value of urban green spaces},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Abstract = {Predicted rapid increases in urbanization in the face of accelerating
   biodiversity loss underscores the need for urban development that
   promotes, rather than displaces, native plants and animals. One approach
   for increasing urban biodiversity is through the development of ``green
   infrastructure{''}. Although research has explored urban-rural gradients
   and the overall value of urban green infrastructure, few studies have
   investigated the habitat value for wildlife of different types of urban
   greenspace. Here, we use a well-established metric in ecology, giving
   up-densities (GUDs), to compare foraging costs for a common urban
   wildlife species, the eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis),
   among three green infrastructure categories: municipal parks, college
   campuses, and residential yards. We found that GUDs for gray squirrels
   did not differ significantly among location categories after controlling
   for proximity to roads, but proximity to roads was associated with
   significantly higher GUDs in all locations. In an explicit test, we also
   found that both proximity to roads and traffic volume were associated
   with higher GUDs. We also found that maximum distance from roads was
   significantly higher for campuses and parks than for residential yards,
   indicating a greater proportion of the area of campuses and parks is
   ``away from roads{''} compared to residential yards. Our results
   indicate that vehicle traffic may contribute significantly to an ``urban
   landscape of fear{''} for gray squirrels and suggest that campus and
   park configurations that reduce road effects could improve habitat
   quality for squirrels and possibly other animals.},

Title = {`Man-eaters' in the Media: Representation of Human-leopard Interactions
   in India Across Local, National, and International Media},
Journal = {CONSERVATION \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Interactions between humans and wildlife are frequent in India,
   requiring stakeholders to devise mitigation strategies that benefit both
   humans and wildlife. Success of such initiatives can be impacted by
   stakeholders' perceptions of species and related issues, which may be
   unduly influenced by the media. This paper explores media representation
   of Human-Leopard Interactions (HLI) in India, focusing on detecting
   agenda-setting and framing in articles, and whether these differ with
   the level of association with HLI. To accomplish this, we coded articles
   (n=291) from three media-distribution levels with increasing detachment
   to HLI events: local news, Indian national news, and international news,
   and compared the types of agenda-setting and framing found across the
   three. Overall, international media had the most negative portrayal of
   leopards and HLI, while national had the most balanced. Local and
   international media included `man-eater' framing in the majority of
   their stories; whereas stories of leopards as victims were most
   prominent in local news, and victim framing was most frequent in
   national. These results suggest that agenda-setting and framing may vary
   with association with HLI. Despite differences between sources, our
   findings suggest that all media distributions focused primarily on
   stories of leopards causing trouble (e.g., attacks and incursions), or
   in ways viewed as troublesome (e.g. incursions) with few stories of
   leopards as victims or informational pieces. The largely negative
   depiction, and differences in representation between geographic
   locations, could hinder mitigation strategies and policy through
   presenting stakeholders with incomplete information.},

Title = {Using hydrologic suitability for native Everglades slough vegetation to
   assess Everglades restoration scenarios},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {294-304},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Simulating ecological indicator responses to alternate restoration
   strategies provides decision support tools for resource managers and
   restoration planners. Our case study provides a methodology for how to
   utilize hydrologic suitability for native vegetation to evaluate effects
   of modeled restoration scenarios. We propose that hydrologic suitability
   of white water lily. Nymphaea odorata, an indicator species of the
   native Florida Everglades slough vegetation community, be used to
   evaluate modeled restoration scenarios in the Everglades ridge and
   slough landscape. Based on experimentally derived mesocosm and field
   studies and historical evidence, we developed a predictive performance
   measure to assess hydrologic suitability for N. odorata. We applied the
   performance measure to predict the hydrologic suitability for slough
   vegetation in the Everglades ridge and slough landscape using
   model-simulated hydrology of existing conditions, future conditions with
   restoration, and the predrainage Everglades. Our results indicate that
   Everglades restoration will provide the greatest benefits to native
   slough vegetation in Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife
   National Refuge (LNWR), Water Conservation Area (WCA) 3B, and Everglades
   National Park, and may degrade slough conditions within portions of WCA
   2 and WCA 3A. Our analysis indicates that additional restoration efforts
   are needed to fully restore native slough vegetation communities
   throughout the Everglades ridge and slough landscape. Performance
   measure results for the predrainage scenario in the WCAs conflict with
   paleoecological data; these results indicate a need to improve the
   modeled predrainage topography as well as flow and evapotranspiration
   rates of the Natural System Model version 4.6.2 (hereinafter NSM).

Title = {Thermoregulatory costs in molting Antarctic Weddell seals: impacts of
   physiological and environmental conditions},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 4},
Abstract = {For polar marine mammals, the energetic cost of thermoregulation depends
   on ambient conditions in the highly variable surrounding environment.
   Heat conservation strategies used by pinnipeds to reduce total heat loss
   include small surface area to volume ratios, the ability to limit
   perfusion and thick subcutaneous blubber layers. There are limits to how
   cool the skin surface may remain without compromising function,
   especially during the annual pelage molt, when hair and skin are
   replaced. To determine if actively molting seals incur higher
   thermoregulatory costs, surface temperature (ST) and heat flux (HF) were
   measured in 93 adult female Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) both
   prior to and during the active molting period using direct sensors and
   infrared imaging. Linear mixed-effect models revealed that ST increased
   significantly with increased ambient temperature and decreased wind
   speed (contributing 44.6 and 41.7\% of the attributed variance,
   respectively). Seal STs were not impacted by molt status, but were
   maintained at 11.2 +/- 0.3 degrees C warmer than the ambient
   temperature. Infrared imaging results averaged 15.1 +/- 1.4 degrees C
   warmer than direct ST measurements. In contrast, HF was significantly
   higher in seals in early molting stages compared to the pre-molt season
   (P<0.001) and molt status accounted for 66.5\% of the variance in HF.
   Thermoregulatory costs calculated from estimated basal metabolic rate
   and measured HF were more than double for molting seals as compared to
   those in pre-molt. This suggests that perfusion is increased during molt
   to support follicle development, despite the increased energetic costs
   associated with higher HF rates. Because ST, HF and thermoregulatory
   costs are strongly influenced by ambient conditions, molt timing is
   likely under selective pressure to occur during the warmest period of
   the year. Shifts in environmental conditions that delay molt phenology
   or increase HF rates could negatively impact seal populations by further
   increasing thermoregulatory costs.},

Title = {Spatial-temporal pattern analysis of landscape ecological risk

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {It is necessary to improve the ecological environment and keep
   ecological balance of nature reserves that have particularly important
   function on precious and endangered wildlife species conservation. Human
   activities give rise to the remarkable changes in land use/land cover
   (LULC) and further have an effect on the landscape and eco-environment
   in nature reserves. This study evaluated the landscape ecological risk
   based on LULC changes in Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve according
   to different management zones from 1986 to 2015. Results showed that the
   significant change characteristics of LULC were the increase of forest
   and the decrease of cultivated land from 1986 to 2015. The major LULC
   changes took place in the experimental zone, and there was 85.61 km(2)
   cultivated land transferred to the forest. Generally, the ecological
   risk level was low, and the area percentages of the lowest and lower
   risk regions to the total area were all higher than 97\% from 1986 to
   2015. Moreover, the values of ecological risk were discrepant in
   different time, the order of that being 1986 < 2015 < 1995 < 2008.
   Combining the components of different ecological risk levels in every
   management zone, the ecological risk from low to high was the core zone,
   buffer zone, and experimental zone. The ecological risk tended to be
   aggregated in space during 1986-2008, and it was enhanced slightly from
   2008 to 2015. This study focuses on Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve
   to provide assessment for environmental protection and ecological
   management in hope that the method can be applied to other national
   nature reserves in China.},

Abstract = {The Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) historically ranged across the Arabian
   Peninsula and neighboring countries until its extirpation in 1972. In
   1963-1964 a captive breeding program for this species was started at the
   Phoenix Zoo (PHX); it ultimately consisted of 11 animals that became
   known as the `World Herd'. In 1978-1979 a wild population was
   established at the Shaumari Wildlife Reserve (SWR), Jordan, with eight
   descendants from the World Herd and three individuals from Qatar. We
   described the mtDNA and nuclear genetic diversity and structure of PHX
   and SWR. We also determined the long-term demographic and genetic
   viability of these populations under different reciprocal translocation
   scenarios. PHX displayed a greater number of mtDNA haplotypes (n = 4)
   than SWR (n = 2). Additionally, PHX and SWR presented nuclear genetic
   diversities of = 2.88 vs. 2.75, = 0.469 vs. 0.387, and = 0.501 vs.
   0.421, respectively. Although these populations showed no signs of
   inbreeding ( ae 0), they were highly differentiated ( = 0.580; P <
   0.001). Migration between PHX and SWR (Nm = 1, 4, and 8
   individuals/generation) increased their genetic diversity in the
   short-term and substantially reduced the probability of extinction in
   PHX during 25 generations. Under such scenarios, maximum genetic
   diversities were achieved in the first generations before the effects of
   genetic drift became predominant. Although captive populations can
   function as sources of genetic variation for reintroduction programs, we
   recommend promoting mutual and continuous gene flow with wild
   populations to ensure the long-term survival of this species.},

Abstract = {Asian wetlands are pivotal habitats for numerous globally declining
   migratory and resident waterbird species. Ironically 80\% of the
   wetlands in East and South East Asia are classified as threatened, with
   50\% under grave threat. In particular the mangrove wetlands are under
   serious threat due to large scale conversion for commercial shrimp ponds
   and sea level rise. So, the impoverishment of natural wetlands has
   forced waterbirds to find alternative habitats. On the other hand, some
   recent studies have highlighted the potential role of anthropogenic,
   artificial and restored habitats such as coastal grazing marshes,
   salinas and rice fields to be good habitats for waterbirds. The present
   study was mainly designed to investigate the role of abandoned shrimp
   ponds near the mangroves supporting the migratory and resident
   waterbirds in the Kodiyampalayam area of Pichavaram mangroves. The
   results show that the abandoned aqua ponds support 26 species of
   waterbirds. Among them, 16 were migrant and three were in the near
   threatened (NT) category of IUCN. Suggestions were made in order to
   improve the habitat to attract more number of waterbird species in the
   near future.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic influences such as hunting pressure and habitat
   fragmentation can alter the demographic and spatial patterns of wildlife
   populations. Understanding the consequences of these impacts is a
   challenge for natural resource managers, which can be overcome by
   investigations using spatial genetic techniques. We used spatial
   autocorrelation and landscape genetic analyses to compare the impacts of
   anthropogenic forces on the spatial genetic structure of two female
   black bear (Ursus americanus) populations in northern New Hampshire with
   similar bear densities but varying human densities, hunting pressure and
   sex ratios. We found evidence of an impact of hunting mortality on the
   spatial genetic structure of female black bears. The population with
   greater hunting pressure and a heavily male-biased sex ratio (Milan)
   exhibited greater spatial genetic structure represented by a pattern of
   isolation by distance, kin clustering, and reduced dispersal in
   comparison to the population with a balanced sex ratio (Pittsburg). We
   did not find a strong effect of fragmenting landscape features on female
   spatial structure. Major roads were correlated with spatial genetic
   structure, but only in the population with lower human density and
   development (Pittsburg). Slope and elevation were also correlated with
   spatial genetic structure, suggesting terrain plays a role in
   structuring seasonal female home range boundaries. Our study revealed
   the utility of using spatial genetic techniques to identify
   anthropogenic influences on female social organization. These findings
   highlight the importance of monitoring the impacts of harvest pressure
   not only on demographics but also the spatial genetic structure of
   animal populations.},

Title = {Pedigree reconstruction using molecular data reveals an early warning

Abstract = {Tasmanian devils have experienced an 85\% population decline since the
   emergence of an infectious cancer. In response, a captive insurance
   population was established in 2006 with a subpopulation later introduced
   onto Maria Island, Tasmania. We aimed to (1) examine the genetic
   parameters of the Maria Island population as a stand-alone site and
   within its broader metapopulation context, (2) assess the efficacy of
   assisted colonisations, and (3) inform future translocations. This study
   reconstructs the pedigree of 86 island-born devils using 31 polymorphic
   microsatellite loci. Combined molecular and pedigree analysis was used
   to monitor change in population genetic parameters in 4 years since
   colonisation. Molecular analysis alone revealed no significant change in
   genetic diversity, while DNA-reconstructed pedigree analysis revealed a
   statistically significant increase in inbreeding due to skewed founder
   representation. Pedigree modelling predicted that gene diversity would
   only be maintained above the threshold of 95\% for a further 2 years,
   dropping to 77.1\% after 40 years. Modelling alternative supplementation
   strategies revealed introducing eight new founders every 3 years will
   enable the population to retain 95\% gene diversity until 2056, provided
   the translocated animals breed; to ensure this we recommend introducing
   ten new females every 3 years. We highlight the value of combining
   pedigree analyses with molecular data, from both a single-site and
   metapopulation viewpoint, for analysing changes in genetic parameters
   within populations of conservation concern. The importance of
   post-release genetic monitoring in an established population is
   emphasised, given how quickly inbreeding can accumulate and gene
   diversity be lost.},

Title = {Using genetic analysis to estimate population size, sex ratio, and

   humans in Alur, southern India},
Journal = {CONSERVATION GENETICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {With growing human and, possibly, elephant populations and a drastic
   increase in anthropogenic activities, human-elephant conflict in Asia
   has been on the rise. The Alur area in Karnataka state, southern India,
   is one such case in point, which has witnessed increasing levels of
   human-elephant conflict over the last two decades. The tiny, moderately
   protected habitat available for elephants in this human-dominated
   landscape does not appear to be able to support elephants over the long
   term. Options to deal with the escalating conflict include translocation
   of elephants, bringing elephants into captivity, and culling. We carried
   out a molecular genetic study of elephants in the Alur area to estimate
   the minimum number of elephants using the area, the sex ratio, genetic
   relatedness between individuals, and genetic structure with regard to
   the larger population in the landscape, so that informed management
   decisions could be made. Fresh dung samples were collected from the
   field and genotyped using 12 microsatellite loci. We found 29 unique
   individuals in the population, comprising 17 females and 12 males of
   different age classes. Relatedness between females suggested independent
   colonisations by discrete, small groups rather than by one cohesive clan
   of related females. This obviates the need for a single solution for
   dealing with all the females in the area in order to maintain social
   integrity, and has implications in terms how these elephants can be
   dealt with. We demonstrate how social organization inferred through
   molecular data from non-invasive sampling can inform management
   decisions.},

Title = {The effects of red fox scent on winter activity patterns of suburban
   wildlife: evaluating predator-prey interactions and the importance of
   groundhog burrows in promoting biodiversity},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {During winter, prey species in suburban areas of the northeastern United
   States must consider trade-offs in maximizing survival while they are
   simultaneously constrained by predators and climatic conditions
   associated with winter such as snow and low temperatures. Many mammalian
   prey mitigate the physiological stress from the cold by taking refuge in
   burrows. Some have also developed olfactory sensitivity to predator
   scent cues as they attempt to avoid predation in the landscape of fear
   and co-evolutionary arms race between predators and prey. The Eastern
   cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) is one of these species that both
   uses burrows in winter and is sensitive to scents. However, despite the
   importance of cottontails in the diet of Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), one
   of their major predators, little is known about scent cues that
   cottontails use to detect foxes. Eastern cottontails and other suburban
   wildlife that occupied burrows dug by Groundhogs near Ithaca, New York,
   USA were exposed to scent wicks treated with Red fox urine during the
   winter of 2017-2018 to determine if the frequency of burrow use would
   decrease because of a perceived heightened risk of predation. We
   observed no response to the predator odor by cottontails and the other
   burrow-utilizing species. This lack of a behavioral response by prey may
   be due to the attenuation of fear in suburban environments. A surprising
   variety of mammalian and avian taxa (n = 22) were recorded at burrows,
   including Striped skunks, mice, Domestic cats, Virginia opossums,
   Bobcats, White-tailed deer, Weasels, a Coyote, and a Gray fox.
   Surprisingly we did not observe a single Red fox, for whom intraspecific
   scent cues are also important. We also documented daily patterns of
   activity around burrows of the five most commonly observed taxa. Our
   investigation reveals that Groundhogs are notable ecosystem engineers
   whose burrows function as important landscape features and local
   hotspots of biodiversity during the winter in a suburban ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Shorebirds use key migratory stopover habitats in spring and fall where
   body proteins are replenished and lipids stored as fuel for the
   remaining journey. The Fraser River estuary, British Columbia, Canada,
   is a critical spring stopover site for hundreds of thousands of
   migrating western sandpiper, Calidris mauri, and dunlin, Calidris
   alpina. Intertidal biofilm in spring is an important nutritional source
   for western sandpiper, with previous isotopic research predicting
   45-59\% of total diet and 50\% of total energy needs. However, these
   studies relied on isotopic mixing models that did not consider metabolic
   routing of key dietary macromolecules. Complexity arises due to the
   mixed macromolecular composition of biofilm that is difficult to
   characterize isotopically. We expanded on these earlier findings by
   considering a protein pathway from diet to the body protein pool
   represented by liver tissue, using a Bayesian mixing model based on
   delta C-13 and delta N-15. We used delta C-1(3) measurements of adipose
   tissue and breath CO2 to provide an estimate of the carbohydrate and
   protein delta C-1(3) values of microphytobenthos and used these derived
   values to better inform the isotopic mixing models. Our results
   reinforce earlier estimates of the importance of biofilm to staging
   shorebirds in predicting that assimilated nutrients from biofilm
   contribute similar to 35\% of the protein budgets for staging western
   sandpipers (n = 13) and dunlin (n = 11) and at least 41\% of the energy
   budget of western sandpiper (n = 69). Dunlin's ingestion of biofilm
   appeared higher than anticipated given their expected reliance on
   invertebrate prey compared to western sandpiper, a biofilm specialist.
   Isotopic analyses of bulk tissues that consider metabolic routing and
   that make use of breath CO 2 and adipose lipid assays can provide new
   insights into avian physiology. We advocate further isotopic research to
   better understand biofilm use by migratory shorebirds in general and as
   a critical requirement for more effective conservation.},

Abstract = {American mink Neovison vison is a semi-aquatic mustelid that has been
   introduced throughout Europe. Several attempts to eradicate this
   invasive species have been carried out since its spread. In the Iberian
   Peninsula, an eradication program has started since 2001, as part of the
   national action plan for the conservation of European mink Mustela
   lutreola. Proper detection is crucial for management, both for
   monitoring variation in mink abundance and prevent the recolonization of
   cleared areas. Mink scats can be confounded with those of several
   same-sized mustelids, and with the spraints of Eurasian otter Lutra
   lutra, which also occur along watercourses. However, these difficulties
   can be overcome by non-invasive genetic methods. With the aim of
   providing a cost-effective and reliable technique for differentiating
   mink scats from those of the largest possible number of species with
   morphologically similar scats, we tested the effectiveness of an already
   available faecal mtDNA-based PCR-RFLP method for distinguishing mink-
   and otter faeces. We then applied the method for analysing scats
   collected and identified in the field by trained surveyors for
   monitoring the success of mink control operations. The PCR-RFLP method
   clearly differentiated mink scats from those of otters, as restriction
   enzymes produced well-defined different patterns. Eighty-five percent of
   94 faecal samples could be assigned to a mustelid species. Only three
   out of seven putative mink samples were confirmed, suggesting that the
   accuracy of the visual identification of scats is questionable and
   genetic methods are needed for the reliable assessment of the success of
   eradication programs.},

Title = {Genetic signature of immigrants and their effect on genetic diversity in

Abstract = {Transboundary connectivity is a key component when conserving and
   managing animal species that require large areas to maintain viable
   population sizes. Wolves Canis lupus recolonized the Scandinavian
   Peninsula in the early 1980s. The population is geographically isolated
   and relies on immigration to not lose genetic diversity and to maintain
   long term viability. In this study we address (1) to what extent the
   genetic diversity among Scandinavian wolves has recovered during 30
   years since its foundation in relation to the source populations in
   Finland and Russia, (2) if immigration has occurred from both Finland
   and Russia, two countries with very different wolf management and
   legislative obligations to ensure long term viability of wolves, and (3)
   if immigrants can be assumed to be unrelated. Using 26 microsatellite
   loci we found that although the genetic diversity increased among
   Scandinavian wolves (n = 143), it has not reached the same levels found
   in Finland (n = 25) or in Russia (n = 19). Low genetic differentiation
   between Finnish and Russian wolves, complicated our ability to determine
   the origin of immigrant wolves (n = 20) with respect to nationality.
   Nevertheless, based on differences in allelic richness and private
   allelic richness between the two countries, results supported the
   occurrence of immigration from both countries. A priori assumptions that
   immigrants are unrelated is non-advisable, since 5.8\% of the pair-wise
   analyzed immigrants were closely related. To maintain long term
   viability of wolves in Northern Europe, this study highlights the
   potential and need for management actions that facilitate transboundary
   dispersal.},

Abstract = {After decades, even centuries of persecution, large carnivore
   populations are widely recovering in Europe. Considering the recent
   recovery of the wolverine (Gulo gulo) in Finland, our aim was to
   evaluate genetic variation using 14 microsatellites and mtDNA control
   region (579 bp) in order (1) to determine whether the species is
   represented by a single genetic population within Finland, (2) to
   quantify the genetic diversity, and (3) to estimate the effective
   population size. We found two major genetic clusters divided between
   eastern and northern Finland based on microsatellites (F-ST = 0.100) but
   also a significant pattern of isolation by distance. Wolverines in
   western Finland had a genetic signature similar to the northern cluster,
   which can be explained by former translocations of wolverines from
   northern to western Finland. For both main clusters, most estimates of
   the effective population size N-e were below 50. Nevertheless, the
   genetic diversity was higher in the eastern cluster (H-E = 0.57, A(R) =
   4.0, A(P) = 0.3) than in the northern cluster (H-E = 0.49, A(R) = 3.7,
   A(P) = 0.1). Migration between the clusters was low. Two mtDNA
   haplotypes were found: one common and identical to Scandinavian
   wolverines; the other rare and not previously detected. The rare
   haplotype was more prominent in the eastern genetic cluster. Combining
   all available data, we infer that the genetic population structure
   within Finland is shaped by a recent bottleneck, isolation by distance,
   human-aided translocations and postglacial recolonization routes.},

Abstract = {Large carnivore populations are declining worldwide due to direct and
   indirect conflicts with humans. Protected areas are critical for
   conserving large carnivores, but increasing human-wildlife conflict,
   tourism, and human population growth near these sanctuaries may have
   negative effects on the carnivores within sanctuary borders. Our goals
   were to investigate how anthropogenic disturbance along the edge of the
   Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, influences the demography and
   space-use of two large carnivore species that engage in intense
   interspecific competition. Here we document, in one disturbed region of
   the Reserve, a rapid increase in the population size of one large
   predator, the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), but a striking concurrent
   decline in numbers of another, the African lion (Panthera leo).
   Anthropogenic disturbances negatively affected lion populations, and
   decreasing lion numbers appear to have a positive effect on hyena
   populations, indicated here by an increase in juvenile survivorship. We
   also saw an increase in the number of livestock consumed by hyenas. Our
   results suggest human population growth and indirect effects of human
   activity along Reserve boundaries may be effecting a trophic cascade
   inside the Reserve itself. These results indicate both top-down and
   bottom-up processes are causing a shift in the carnivore community, and
   a major disruption of guild structure, inside the boundaries of one of
   the most spectacular protected areas in Africa.},

Title = {Effects of cumulated outdoor activity on wildlife habitat use},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {253},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Humans profoundly affect animal distributions by directly competing for
   space, not only transforming, but actively using their habitat.
   Anthropogenic disturbance is usually measured via structural proxies
   such as infrastructure and land use that overlook the impact of human
   presence, or functional disturbance. In this study, we propose a
   methodology unifying two paradigms, human mobility and animal movement,
   to fill this gap. We developed a novel spatially-explicit index of
   anthropic disturbance, the Cumulative Outdoor activity Index (COI), and
   validated it with ground truth observations derived from camera trapping
   (r = +0.63, p < 0.001). Building on previous work from Peters et al.
   (2015, Biol. Cons. 186, 123-133) on a Critically Endangered brown bear
   population in the Alps, we used Resource Selection Analysis to assess
   the influence of different forms of anthropogenic disturbance on the
   relative probability of habitat selection. The intensity of COI provided
   an effective measure of functional anthropogenic disturbance, and it
   outperformed all alternative and commonly-used proxies of structural
   disturbance in predicting bear habitat use. Our predictions suggest that
   brown bear shrinks its ecological niche as a consequence of intense
   human use of otherwise suitable habitat. These constraints may limit the
   potential range expansion of bears to establish a viable Alpine-Dinaric
   metapopulation. Conclusive conservation and future land use planning
   towards human-wildlife coexistence should account for the functional
   presence of humans on the landscape. The proposed COI could help
   determine where mitigation measures should be enforced.},

Abstract = {In some regions of the world, large carnivores, such as wolves, persist
   in landscapes with dense networks of paved roads. However, beyond the
   general impacts of roads on wildlife, we still lack information on
   carnivore responses to different types of roads and traffic volume
   levels. Using wolves in NW Spain as a case study, we show how wolves
   respond differently to paved road classes depending on road size, speed
   limit and traffic volume. All wolves evaluated (25 GPS collared wolves)
   crossed paved roads. Overall, during 3,915 sampling days, we recorded
   29,859 wolf crossings. Wolf crossings of all paved road classes were
   recorded at a mean rate of 0.022 crossings/day/km (95\% CI 0.016-0.027).
   Wolves crossed low speed and low traffic volume roads more frequently,
   and more often during the night, in order to lessen the chances of
   encountering traffic. We found mortality to be highest on roads with
   high speed and high traffic volume. How wolves interact with paved roads
   should be considered in landscape planning strategies in order to
   guarantee wolf long-term persistence in human-dominated landscapes. In
   our case, our results support an increasing focus on primary roads
   (class II) to identify segments of these roads where road mitigation
   efforts should be prioritised. Our study also highlights the importance
   of considering paved road classes when studying the impact of roads on
   wildlife.},

Abstract = {The native land snails of the Hawaiian Islands have suffered numerous
   extinctions and continue to decline rapidly. A leading cause of these
   extinctions has been the impact of non-native predators. Oxychilus
   alliarius is a European predatory snail that has been in Hawaii since at
   least 1937 and has become one of the most abundant invasive snails in
   the islands. It is a facultative carnivore and will also consume
   non-animal food. However, this species has been mostly ignored as a
   threat and the majority of conservation attention has been focused on
   Euglandina rosea, the Rosy Wolf Snail. Here we report predation by O.
   alliarius on two rare and endemic Hawaiian snail species: Kaala
   subrutila (Helicarionidae) and Pleuropoma cf. sandwichiensis
   (Helicinidae). The wide distribution of O. alliarius in Hawaii, its high
   abundance, and now compelling evidence that it preys on native (and
   probably endangered) snails, indicate that it could be a much greater
   threat than previously thought.},

Title = {Keep the wolf from the door: How to conserve wolves in Europe's

Abstract = {The recolonization of wolves in European human-dominated landscapes
   poses a conservation challenge to protect this species and manage
   conflicts. The question of how humans can co-exist with large carnivores
   often triggers strong emotions. Here we provide an objective,
   science-based discussion on possible management approaches. Using
   existing knowledge on large carnivore management from Europe and other
   parts of the globe, we develop four potential wolf management scenarios;
   1) population control, 2) protection and compensation, 3) fencing, 4)
   managing behaviour of wolf and man. For each scenario, we discuss its
   impact on wolf ecology, its prospects of reducing wolf-human conflicts
   and how it relates to current European legislation. Population control
   and fencing of local wolf populations are problematic because of their
   ecological impacts and conflicts with European legislation. In contrast,
   a no-interference approach does not have these problems but will likely
   increase human-wolf conflicts. Despite the large challenges in European,
   human-dominated landscapes, we argue that wolf management must focus on
   strengthening the separation between humans and wolves by influencing
   behaviour of wolves and humans on a fine spatio-temporal scale to
   prevent and reduce conflicts. As separation also demands a sufficiently
   large wild prey base, we urge restoring natural ungulate populations, to
   reduce human-wolf conflicts. Mutual avoidance provides the key to
   success, and is critical to avoid creating the conditions for
   reinstating wolf persecution as the default policy in Europe.},

Title = {A Reprieve from US wildlife mortality on roads during the COVID-19

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {256},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {High traffic volume is one of the main contributors to wildlife-vehicle
   collision (WVC) and wildlife mortality on roads. Government
   shelter-in-place (SIP) orders have been used to help mitigate the spread
   of COVID-19, resulting in unprecedented reductions in global traffic
   volumes. Using traffic and collision data from four US states
   (California, Idaho, Maine, and Washington), we investigated changes in
   total WVC, following the state and local SIP orders. From mid-March to
   mid-April 2020, these orders have resulted in up to 71\%, 63\%, 73\%,
   and 72\% reduction in driving, as measured by vehicle miles traveled
   (VMT), in CA, ID, ME, and WA respectively. The daily WVC rates from the
   4 weeks prior to SIP orders going into effect, to the 4 weeks after,
   declined 34\%, with 21, 36, 44, and 33\% declines for CA, ID, ME, and
   WA, respectively. For mountain lions (Puma concolor) in CA, there was a
   58\% decline in mortality during the traffic reduction. The changes in
   WVC from 1 month pre-SIP orders to 1 month post-order only occurred in
   2020 and not 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, or 2019, suggesting that the
   reductions were associated with the reductions in traffic. The measured
   declines in WVC reversed in ME and WA during May, June and July 2020,
   paralleling reversals in traffic volumes. A 34\% reduction in WVC would
   potentially equate to 10s of millions fewer vertebrates killed on US
   roadways during one month of traffic reduction, representing an
   unintentional conservation action unprecedented in modern times.},

Title = {Physiological mechanisms linking cold acclimation and the poleward
   distribution limit of a range-extending marine fish},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Extensions of species'geographical distributions, or range extensions,
   are among the primary ecological responses to climate change in the
   oceans. Considerable variation across the rates at which species' ranges
   change with temperature hinders our ability to forecast range extensions
   based on climate data alone. To better manage the consequences of
   ongoing and future range extensions for global marine biodiversity, more
   information is needed on the biological mechanisms that link
   temperatures to range limits. This is especially important at
   understudied, low relative temperatures relevant to poleward range
   extensions, which appear to outpace warm range edge contractions four
   times over. Here, we capitalized on the ongoing range extension of a
   teleost predator, the Australasian snapper Chrysophrys auratus, to
   examine multiple measures of ecologically relevant physiological
   performance at the population's poleward range extension front. Swim
   tunnel respirometry was used to determine how mid-range and poleward
   range edge winter acclimation temperatures affect metabolic rate,
   aerobic scope, swimming performance and efficiency and recovery from
   exercise. Relative to `optimal' mid-range temperature acclimation,
   subsequent range edge minimum temperature acclimation resulted in
   absolute aerobic scope decreasing while factorial aerobic scope
   increased; efficiency of swimming increased while maximum sustainable
   swimming speed decreased; and recovery from exercise required a longer
   duration despite lower oxygen payback. Cold-acclimated swimming faster
   than 0.9 body lengths sec(-1) required a greater proportion of aerobic
   scope despite decreased cost of transport. Reduced aerobic scope did not
   account for declines in recovery and lower maximum sustainable swimming
   speed. These results suggest that while performances decline at range
   edge minimum temperatures, cold-acclimated snapper are optimized for
   energy savings and range edge limitation may arise from suboptimal
   temperature exposure throughout the year rather than acute minimum
   temperature exposure. We propose incorporating performance data with in
   situ behaviour and environmental data in bioenergetic models to better
   understand how thermal tolerance determines range limits.},

Abstract = {Since the late Pleistocene, species in the order Carnivora have
   experienced a drastic reduction in their populations and distributions.
   However, the global genetic diversity patterns among terrestrial
   carnivores have not been investigated. Using felid species as model, we
   characterized the genetic variation within their populations among
   continents, between tropical and non-tropical regions, and in relation
   to human activities. We then evaluated how species traits influence the
   observed patterns of interspecific genetic diversity. Through data
   collected from 135 population genetic studies conducted on 28 wild felid
   species (70\% of the described species), data analyses using GLMM
   modelling showed that the populations in Africa and South America have
   significantly higher heterozygosity and allelic richness than those in
   other continents. The Asiatic lions have the least genetic diversity
   compared to other felids in the world. Threatened species have
   significantly lower genetic diversity compared to low-risk species as
   predicted. However, genetic diversity was not related to species body
   mass or geographic range. We found generation length to be an important
   variable explaining genetic diversity variation, in which species with
   short generation length have reduced genetic diversity. Furthemore, the
   combination of generation length, habitat and home range size captures
   the variation in heterozygosity significantly better. Species dependent
   on closed-habitat and with large home range size have reduced
   heterozygosity compared to their counterparts. Our results allow to
   identify priority felid species vulnerable to loss of genetic diversity
   for further conservation studies, and provide an insight into the
   possible genetic consequences of the late Pleistocene extinctions.},

Abstract = {Outbreaks of infectious disease represent serious threats to the
   viability of many vertebrate populations, but few studies have included
   quantitative evaluations of alternative approaches to the management of
   disease. The most prevalent management approach is monitoring for and
   rapid response to an epizootic. An alternative is vaccination of a
   subset of the free-living population (i.e., a vaccinated core) such that
   some individuals are partially or fully immune in the event of an
   epizootic. We developed a simulation model describing epizootic
   dynamics, which we then embedded in a demographic simulation to assess
   these alternative approaches to managing rabies epizootics in the island
   fox (Urocyon littoralis), a species composed of only 6 small populations
   on the California Channel Islands. Although the monitor and respond
   approach was superior to the vaccinated-core approach for some
   transmission models and parameter values, this type of reactive
   management did not protect the population from rabies under many
   disease-transmission assumptions. In contrast, a logistically feasible
   program of prophylactic vaccination for part of the wild population
   yielded low extinction probabilities across all likely
   disease-transmission scenarios, even with recurrent disease
   introductions. Our use of a single metric of successful
   managementprobability of extreme endangerment (i.e., quasi extinction)to
   compare very different management approaches allowed an objective
   assessment of alternative strategies for controlling the threats posed
   by infectious disease outbreaks.},

Title = {Effects of habitat suitability and minimum patch size thresholds on the
   assessment of landscape connectivity for jaguars in the Sierra Gorda,
   Mexico},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {204},

Abstract = {Maintaining habitat and its connectivity is a major conservation goal,
   especially for large carnivores. Assessments of habitat connectivity are
   typically based on the output of habitat suitability models to first map
   potential habitat, and then identify where corridors exist. This
   requires separating habitat from non-habitat, thus one must choose
   specific thresholds for both habitat suitability and the minimum patch
   size that can be occupied. The selection of these thresholds is often
   arbitrary, and the effects of threshold choice on assessments of
   connectivity are largely unknown. We sought to quantify how
   habitat-suitability and patch-size thresholds influence connectivity
   assessments for jaguars (Panthera onca) in the Sierra Gorda Biosphere
   Reserve in central Mexico. We modeled potential habitat for jaguars
   using the species distribution modeling algorithm Maxent, and assessed
   potential habitat connectivity with the landscape connectivity software
   Conefor Sensinode. We repeated these analyses for 45 combinations of
   habitat suitability based thresholds and minimum patch sizes. Our
   results indicated that the thresholds influenced connectivity
   assessments greatly, and different combinations of the two thresholds
   yielded vastly different map configurations of suitable habitat for
   jaguars. We developed an approach to identify the pair of thresholds
   that best matched the jaguar occurrence points based on the connectivity
   scores. Among the combinations that we tested, a threshold of 03 for
   habitat suitability and 2 km(2) for minimum patch size produced the best
   fit (area under the curve = 0.9). Surprisingly, we found low suitable
   habitat for jaguars in most of the core areas of the reserve according
   to our best potential habitat model, but highly suitable areas in the
   buffer zones and just outside of the reserve. We conclude that the best
   and most connected potential areas for jaguar habitat are in the central
   eastern part of the Sierra Gorda. More broadly, landscape connectivity
   analyses appears to be highly sensitive to the thresholds used to
   identify suitable habitat, and we recommend conducting sensitivity
   analyses as introduced here to identify the optimal combination of
   thresholds. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   Clarifications in numbers of tigers, available habitat and prey
   requirements indicate that more land and additional recovery of
   preferred prey species will be critical for a successful reintroduction.
   A focus on threat assessments and mitigations will be more important
   than a focus on site management tools. Local attitudes and levels of
   poaching require more attention than in the current assessment, as they
   are likely to be major obstacles to successful large carnivore
   reintroductions in Asia. Given the limited resources for rangewide tiger
   conservation, the value of such long-term initiatives must be weighed
   relative to the urgent need to recover and secure existing tiger
   populations before they also become extinct.},

Abstract = {Free-ranging domestic cats (Felis catus) cats kill billions of wild
   animals every year, spread parasites and diseases to both wildlife and
   humans, and are responsible for the extinction or extirpation of at
   least 63 species. While the ecology and conservation implications of
   free-ranging cats have been well studied in some locations, relatively
   little is known about cats inhabiting suburban nature preserves in the
   United States. To address this knowledge gap, we used camera traps to
   study the occupancy and activity patterns of free-ranging cats in 55
   suburban nature preserves in the Chicago, IL metropolitan area. From
   2010 to 2018 (4440 trap days), we recorded 355 photos of free-ranging
   cats at 41 randomly distributed monitoring points (psi(naive) = 0.18)
   within 26 preserves (psi(naive) = 0.45). Cats were detected every year,
   but rarely at the same point or preserve, and cats were active during
   day and night. Cat occupancy increased with building density and
   detectability was highest near preserve boundaries. Based on our
   top-ranked model, predicted occupancy within individual preserves ranged
   from 0.07 to 0.42 (psi(mean) = 0.12) depending on the year. Overall, our
   results suggest that free-ranging cats are rare within suburban
   preserves in our study area, and that these cats are most likely owned
   or heavily subsidized by people (which pose different risks and
   management challenges than feral cats). We discuss the conservation and
   management implications for suburban natural areas.},

Abstract = {Civil conflicts often affect the control of natural resources, altering
   their access and use. Using a combination of questionnaires, remote
   sensing, and a review of articles in the popular print media, we
   investigated the impact of a protracted armed conflict on forest loss,
   livelihoods, and forest use near two globally important tiger reserves
   in northeastern India. Over a 23 year period, we found evidence of
   large-scale forest loss in the vicinity of Nameri and Pakke Tiger
   Reserves. Nearly all (99 \%) interviewees opined that the ethno-civil
   strife was to blame for declining forest cover. Most interviewees
   identified 1990 as the year of onset of strife-mediated deforestation.
   This is partially supported by a review of print-media articles that
   reported conflict, violence, displacement, and the onset of large-scale
   migration in the previous year. According to respondents, ethno-civil
   strife has radically altered access to, and use of forests, by resident
   communities (causing economic hardship, increased costs, and reduced
   availability of essential timber products), and has also accelerated
   forest loss and increased poaching. We conclude that forests and
   wildlife in these protected areas are at immediate risk from ethno-civil
   strife. Urgent interventions are needed to reduce the environmental and
   societal impacts of civil strife in this biologically crucial region of
   India.},

Abstract = {Nectaries are structures that secrete a sugary solution and can occur on
   vegetative and/or reproductive parts of plants. The significance of
   floral nectaries to reward vertebrate and arthropod pollinators is well
   supported. The role of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) is more ambiguous,
   though research has been skewed to the ant-plant mutualism. Many other
   insects feed at EFNs, but these interactions are vastly understudied.
   This study addresses the hypothesis that EFNs may influence the
   occurrence and structure of Neotropical canopy beetle communities. Seven
   canopy trees (four families) exhibiting EFNs and their associated
   beetles were studied over a one-year period in southern Venezuela. In
   total, 6818 adult beetles identified to 868 species were recorded on 25
   investigated canopy tree species (\#47 individuals). Of the 868 beetle
   species, 150 species (517 individuals; 17.3\% species) from 20 families
   were observed drinking from foliar EFNs on seven EFN-bearing tree
   species. Dietary dependence on EF nectar varied, with 95 beetle species
   utilising this nectar within a broader diet and 55 species found feeding
   exclusively on EFNs. This study demonstrates unequivocally that EF
   nectar is a frequently utilised food resource of many beetle adults and
   beetles have been a significantly underestimated visitor group. A more
   detailed study was conducted on six individual canopy trees of two
   species of Chrysobalanaceae, Licania hebantha Mart. ex Hook. f. and
   Moquilea subarachnophylla (Cuatrec.) Sothers and Prance. In total, 115
   individual adults of 64 beetle species were collected on nectar secreted
   on newly-sprouted leaves. These beetle assemblages were dominated by
   species utilising EF nectar and were associated with distinct
   phenological phases of the host trees. Altogether, the beetle survey
   found support for the hypothesis that EFNs influence the occurrence and
   structure of beetle communities. These beetle-EFN relationships have
   implications for spatial arrangement, community assembly and evolution
   of both host plants and beetles. Like ant-EFN mutualism, EFN-bearing
   trees and beetles may also form mutualism. It is possible that the
   plants offer easier access to a nutritious resource that may deflect
   herbivory of vegetative parts.},

Title = {Potential distribution and connectivity for recolonizing cougars in the
   Great Lakes region, USA},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {257},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Cougars (Puma concolor) have lost substantial portions of their
   historical range yet increased sightings suggest potential for
   re-establishment in some regions; greater understanding of potential
   distribution and connectivity is necessary to make sound management and
   policy decisions. Specifically, the Great Lakes region of the USA will
   likely be an important area for cougar range expansion into the Midwest
   and Eastern USA. We used verified cougar observations to model and
   predict potential distribution and connectivity in the Great Lakes
   region. We compiled all confirmed observations of cougars from Michigan,
   Minnesota, and Wisconsin (2010-2020); which resulted in 180 reports (154
   images/videos, 20 signs, 6 mortalities). We developed an ensemble
   distribution model (1 km res) based on three machine learning methods.
   We used weighted cost-distances to identify linkages between core areas
   and circuit theory to model overall connectivity potential. We
   calculated selection ratios for land covers (30 m res) at fine and
   coarse scales. The ensemble distribution model had good performance (ROC
   of 0.94). Suitability was positively associated with increasing
   vegetation structure, lower distance to natural cover, and mid-high
   terrain ruggedness. Forest covers were always selected for regardless of
   scale, and human development was avoided only at the coarser scale. We
   identified 191 core patches and 362 linkages connecting them; only
   50.1\% of them were located within legally protected areas. We
   identified high regional connectivity in a generally west-east
   direction. Successful conservation of large carnivores like cougars will
   depend on conserving not only habitat patches and linkages but also
   efforts to facilitate long-term coexistence.},

Title = {Brown hyaenas on roads: Estimating carnivore occupancy and abundance
   using spatially auto-correlated sign survey replicates},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {144},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1799-1807},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Carnivore survey protocols that properly address spatial sampling and
   detectability issues are seldom feasible at a landscape-scale. This
   limits knowledge of large-scale patterns in distribution, abundance and
   their underlying determinants, hindering conservation of globally
   threatened carnivore populations. Occupancy analysis of data from
   logistically efficient sign surveys along consecutive road segments
   (spatially auto-correlated replicates) offers a potential solution. We
   adapted and applied this newly-developed method over 62,979 km(2) of
   human-modified land in South Africa. Our aims were to (1) generate
   unbiased estimates of brown hyaena occupancy and abundance (2)
   investigate two suspected determinants of occupancy using a combination
   of biological and socio-economic sampling techniques, and (3) use
   simulations to evaluate the effort required for abundance and occupancy
   estimates with acceptable bias, precision and power. Brown hyaena
   occupancy was estimated at 0.748 (+/- SE 0.1), and estimated overall
   density in agricultural land (0.15/100 km(2), +/- SE 0.08) was an order
   of magnitude lower than in protected areas. Positive attitudes to
   carnivores and presence of wildlife farms exerted strong positive
   effects on occupancy, so changes in these factors may well exert
   monotonic impacts on local metapopulation status. Producing reliable
   occupancy and abundance estimates would require >= 6 replicates and >=
   12 replicates per site respectively. Detecting 50\% and 30\% declines in
   brown hyaena occupancy with adequate power would require five annual
   surveys at >= 65 sites and >= 125 sites respectively. Our results
   suggest that protocols based on spatially auto-correlated sign survey
   replicates could be used to monitor carnivore populations at large, and
   possibly even country-wide spatial scales. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {First assessment of hoary fox (Lycalopex vetulus) seasonal ovarian
   cyclicity by non-invasive hormonal monitoring technique},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {Reproduction is key to species survival, and reproductive physiology
   represents a high priority investigative area for conservation biology,
   as it provides a basic understanding of critical life-history traits,
   information that is helpful for the establishment of management
   strategies. Here, we generated knowledge about the reproductive
   endocrinology of the hoary fox (Lycalopex vetulus), a small canid (2.5-4
   kg) endemic to open areas of the Brazilian Cerrado and listed in the
   Brazilian National List of Endangered species. Specifically, we utilized
   non-invasive hormone monitoring methods to assess oestrogen and
   progestagen metabolites from eight female hoary foxes housed in five
   zoological institutions in the state of Sao Paulo-Brazil. We observed
   the elevations of oestrogen and progestagen metabolites between July and
   September in six of the eight females. No significant evidence of
   ovarian activity was observed during other months. Two females, who
   shared the same enclosure, did not show a pattern of reproductive
   cyclicity. Based on these characteristics, we concluded that captive
   hoary foxes are seasonal monoestric, with the beginning of the oestrus
   cycle occurring mainly in July followed by 2 months of the luteal phase
   when conception does not occur. We suggest the dosage of faecal
   metabolites of estradiol and progesterone could be used to differentiate
   the reproductive period from a non-reproductive period in Lycalopex
   vetulus females, providing relevant information about their reproductive
   biology that may contribute to species conservation and management
   strategies, such as increased ex situ reproductive success.},

Title = {Human-carnivore coexistence in Qomolangma (Mt. Everest) Nature Reserve,
   China: Patterns and compensation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {197},
Pages = {18-26},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Livestock depredation by large carnivores is frequently reported in
   Qomolangma (Mt. Everest) National Nature Reserve, Tibet Autonomous
   Region of China. Seeking to minimize conflicts, we assessed depredation
   patterns and ways to upgrade the compensation program. We gathered 9193
   conflict records over 2011-2013 to determine the extent and
   tempo-spatial patterns of the depredation. We interviewed 22 local
   officials and 94 residents to learn their views on depredations and to
   assess the adequacy of compensation. Data showed that wolves (Canis
   lupus), lynx (Lynx lynx), and snow leopards (Panthera uncia) were the
   major livestock predators. Total livestock loss accounted for 1.2\% of
   the entire stockholding (n = 846,707) in the region. Wolves and lynx
   tended to take sheep and goats, whereas snow leopards favored yaks and
   cattle in relation to their proportional abundance. Predation mostly
   occurred in March through July. Livestock depredation by all predators
   when combined was best explained by terrain ruggedness and density of
   small- and large-bodied livestock. Temporal and spatial predation
   patterns varied among carnivores. Most respondents (74\%) attributed
   depredation causes to an increase in carnivore abundance. Only 7\%
   blamed lax livestock herding practice for predation losses. Five percent
   said that predation was the result of livestock population increases,
   while 11\% had no idea. The compensation scheme was found to be flawed
   in all aspects-predation verification, application procedure,
   compensation standard, operational resource allocation, making payment,
   and other problems. To enhance management for human-carnivore
   coexistence, we recommend a problem-oriented, integrated, adaptive
   approach that targets the complex social context of the conflict and
   addresses the interconnected functions of decision-making process. (C)

Title = {Spatial correlates of livestock depredation by Amur tigers in Hunchun,
   China: Relevance of prey density and implications for protected area
   management},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {117-127},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Livestock depredation by highly endangered Amur tigers is a major source
   of human-tiger conflict in Northeast China. We model livestock
   depredation risk to understand factors shaping the spatial distribution
   of depredation conflicts using Hunchun, China as a case study. Ungulate
   occupancy survey data, presence of ungulate snares and other landscape
   covariates (such as elevation, slope and tree cover) were first used to
   model ungulate prey densities using generalised least squares. Predicted
   densities were then incorporated together with landscape covariates as
   predictors for actual livestock depredation incidents in a zero-inflated
   negative binomial model for depredation risk. Lower overall prey
   densities were associated with proximity to snares, and other
   anthropogenic-related covariates like distances to villages and roads
   were also important predictors of prey densities. Depredation conflicts
   were associated with closer proximity to snares and rivers, greater
   distances from roads, greater tree cover, and deciduous forest habitats.
   High-risk areas were found to be concentrated in community-management
   zones in Hunchun National Nature Reserve (HNR). The results suggest that
   compensation payments for depredations within HNR provide an unwanted
   incentive for local people to continue to use the protected area
   (especially in community co-managed zones) as grazing lands, leading to
   increased conflict. Eliminating cattle and snaring from HNR and other
   tiger recovery zones within Northeast China may be essential to reduce
   conflicts and minimise detrimental impacts on tiger populations. (C)

Title = {Understanding and managing human tolerance for a large carnivore in a
   residential system},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {238},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Human tolerance for interactions with large carnivores is an important
   determinant of their persistence on the landscape, yet the relative
   importance of factors affecting tolerance is not fully understood.
   Further, the impact of management efforts to alter tolerance has not
   been adequately assessed. We developed a model containing a
   comprehensive set of predictors drawn from prior studies and tested it
   through a longitudinal survey measuring tolerance for black bears (Ursus
   americans) in the vicinity of Durango, Colorado, USA. Predictors
   included human-bear conflicts, outcomes of interactions with bears,
   perceptions of benefits and risks from bears, trust in managers,
   perceived similarity with the goals of managers, personal control over
   risks, value orientations toward wildlife, and demographic factors. In
   addition, we monitored changes in tolerance resulting from a
   bear-proofing experiment designed to reduced garbage-related conflicts
   in the community. Residents who perceived greater benefits associated
   with bears and more positive impacts from bear-related interactions had
   higher tolerance. Residents who perceived greater risks and more
   negative impacts and who had greater trust in managers, domination
   wildlife value orientations, and older age were less tolerant. Conflicts
   with bears were not an important predictor, supported by our finding
   that changes in conflicts resulting from our bear-proofing experiment
   did not affect tolerance. In contrast to conservation approaches that
   focus primarily on decreasing human-wildlife conflicts, our findings
   suggest that communication approaches aimed at increasing public
   tolerance for carnivores could be improved by emphasizing the benefits
   and positive impacts of living with these species.},

Title = {Building public trust in compensation programs through accuracy
   assessments of damage verification protocols},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {213},

Pages = {36-41},

Abstract = {Reliable verification of damage claims is fundamental to create public
   trust in the legitimacy of compensation programs, and avoid fraud and
   moral hazards. However, after decades of using this tool, transparency
   in verification processes and availability of quantitative information
   on the accuracy and misidentification rates are unresolved issues.
   Accurate rules overcome several challenges facing compensation programs
   worldwide, such as the difficulty of proving claims, lack of
   compensation or insufficiency of community support. Here, we tested the
   accuracy of the verification protocol of damage claims used in Sweden
   for large carnivore depredations on sheep. In Sweden, verifiers (who
   will determine if a livestock owner is compensated or not after a
   suspected attack) uses rules grounded on typical bite marks from each
   predator species on animal carcasses. Contrasted with DNA salivary
   analysis, verifiers correctly identified wolf and lynx as the culprit
   species in 86\% (n = 57) and 91\% (n = 11) of cases tested,
   respectively, and the overall accuracy in identifying a predation event
   was 94\%. We believe that rigorous tests of current damage verification
   protocols are essential to show people the frequency that predation
   results in compensation, as well as how often other causes of livestock
   death or injury are erroneously interpreted as being inflicted by large
   carnivores. The use of DNA salivary analysis to test the accuracy of
   damage verification protocols is transferable to any livestock-carnivore
   conflict scenario worldwide, as well as to other wildlife, such as
   ungulates browsing on forest plantations and crops.},

Title = {Large herbivore responses to surface water and land use in an East
   African savanna: implications for conservation and human-wildlife
   conflicts},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {573-596},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Water, forage and predation constrain ungulate distributions in
   savannas. To understand these constraints, we characterized
   distributions of 15 herbivore species from water, locations of peak
   density and degree of clustering around the peaks using zero-inflated
   count data models and mapping census data collected in the Mara reserve
   and the adjoining pastoral ranches in Kenya during a wet and dry year.
   Herbivores followed a humped pattern (n = 46), suggesting constrained
   foraging in which they balance the benefits of proximity to water with
   the costs of foraging where food is depleted near water and travelling
   to more abundant food distant from water; an exponentially decreasing
   pattern (n = 11), indicating strong attraction to water or vegetation
   near water; or a uniform (n = 3) pattern. The details rather than the
   types of these patterns varied between years. Herbivores concentrated
   farther from water and more tightly around locations of their peak
   densities in the ranches than the reserve. Herbivores were more abundant
   and widely distributed from water in the wet than the dry year, and
   segregated along the distance-to-water gradient, presumably to minimize
   interspecific competition for food. Pastoralism compressed herbivore
   distributions and partially excluded some species (warthog, hartebeest,
   topi, wildebeest, zebra, eland, buffalo and elephant) from, while
   attracting others (Grant's and Thomson's gazelles, impala, giraffe) to
   the ranches, relative to the reserve. Regulating cultivation, fencing,
   settlements and livestock stocking levels in the ranches would allow
   continued wildlife access to water, reduce competition with,
   displacement or harassment of wildlife by people, livestock and dogs
   near water.},

Title = {Livestock guarding dogs enable human-carnivore coexistence: First
   evidence of equivalent carnivore occupancy on guarded and unguarded
   farms},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {241},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Livestock guarding dogs (LGDs) are advocated to reduce livestock
   depredation on agricultural lands. However, LGDs have been proposed as
   excluding carnivores from guarded farms; this study is the first to test
   this hypothesis in an African ecosystem. We investigated carnivore
   occupancy (black-backed jackal, leopard and brown hyaena) from 1029
   camera-trap days (126 camera locations) in relation to the presence of
   LGDs and a range of habitat and land-use covariates across eight South
   African farms, five of which utilised an LGD. Models containing LGDs had
   little support in explaining leopard or black-backed jackal occupancy,
   although LGD presence had a positive relationship with brown hyaena
   occupancy (beta = 1.14, 95 \% CI = 0.05, 2.23). Leopard detection was
   positively related to the presence of black-backed jackals (beta = 1.47,
   95 \% CI = 0.18, 2.74) and sheep (beta = 1.13, 95 \% CI = 0.14, 2.12),
   whilst black-backed jackal detection was negatively related to lures
   (beta = -1.33, 95 \% CI = -2.00, -0.65) and positively related to the
   presence of brown hyaena (beta = 0.90, 95 \% CI = 0.43, 1.40). Previous
   research in this LGD population has demonstrated the cessation of
   livestock depredation in 91 \% of cases, making dog ineffectiveness
   unlikely to explain their lack of influence on carnivore occupancy. Our
   results provide the first empirical evidence based on ecological data of
   the capacity for LGDs to promote human-carnivore coexistence in an
   African agricultural context, further validating the use of specialist
   guarding dogs as a conservation tool of benefit to both human and
   wildlife populations.},

Title = {Timing of dietary switching by savannah elephants in relation to crop
   consumption},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {249},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Tree and grass quality on the African savannah shows seasonal variation,
   driving mixed-feeding herbivores to switch between browsing and grazing.
   During this switch, crop consumption could be an attractive alternative
   to browsing. We analysed elephant diet variability in the Okavango
   Delta, Botswana, using faecal stable isotope ratios of carbon
   (delta<\^{}>13C) and frequencies of elephant crop consumption, to
   determine the extent to which crop consumption relates to this potential
   switch. Although elephants did increase their relative grass consumption
   in the wet season, browse dominated the annual diet. After February, the
   proportion of grass in the diet dropped considerably, and continued
   decreasing through April when farmers reported most crop consumption.
   Generalized Linear Models revealed that the occurrence of elephant crop
   consumption increased with the proportion of grass consumed and with
   decreasing grass quality. The proportion of grass in elephant faeces
   increased with increasing crop consumption intensity. As crop
   consumption could also be related to nutrient deficiencies in elephant
   diet, we calculated the total dietary input of nutrients to reveal
   potential deficiencies. Elephant diet contained insufficient levels of
   sodium year-round, and insufficient phosphorus from February to July. As
   the latter coincides with the timing of crop consumption, we consider
   our results an indication that phosphorus -and potentially sodium
   deficiencies, could play a role in elephant dietary choices, including
   crop consuming behaviour. Further experimental research is required to
   show whether supplying elephants with supplementary phosphorus and
   sodium sources could reduce this micro-nutrient deficiency, and could
   play a role in reducing elephant crop consumption.},

Abstract = {Large-scale poisoning events are common to scavenging bird species that
   forage communally, many of which are in decline. To reduce the threat of
   poisoning and compensate for other persistent threats, management,
   including supplemental feeding, is ongoing for many reintroduced and
   endangered vulture populations. Through a longitudinal study of lead
   exposure in California condors (Gymnogyps californianus), we illustrate
   the conservation challenges inherent in reintroduction of an endangered
   species to the wild when pervasive threats have not been eliminated. We
   evaluated population-wide patterns in blood lead levels from 1997 to
   2011 and assessed a broad range of putative demographic, behavioral, and
   environmental risk factors for elevated lead exposure among reintroduced
   California condors in California (United States). We also assessed the
   effectiveness of lead ammunition regulations within the condor's range
   in California by comparing condor blood lead levels before and after
   implementation of the regulations. Lead exposure was a pervasive threat
   to California condors despite recent regulations limiting lead
   ammunition use. In addition, condor lead levels significantly increased
   as age and independence from intensive management increased, including
   increasing time spent away from managed release sites, and decreasing
   reliance on food provisions. Greater independence among an increasing
   number of reintroduced condors has therefore elevated the population's
   risk of lead exposure and limited the effectiveness of lead reduction
   efforts to date. Our findings highlight the challenges of restoring
   endangered vulture populations as they mature and become less reliant on
   management actions necessary to compensate for persistent threats.
   Patrones Espaciotemporales y Factores de Riesgo por Exposicion a Plomo
   en Condores de California Durante 15 Anos de Reintroduccion
   Resumen El envenenamiento a gran escala es comun en especies de aves
   carroneras que forrajean comunalmente, muchas de ellas en declinacion.
   Para reducir la amenaza del envenenamiento y compensar otras amenazas
   persistentes, se realizan acciones de manejo, incluyendo la
   suplementacion de alimento, con muchas poblaciones de buitres
   reintroducidas y en peligro. Mediante un estudio longitudinal del
   envenenamiento por plomo en condores de California (Gymnogyps
   californianus), mostramos los retos de conservacion inherentes a la
   reintroduccion de una especie en peligro cuando las amenazas principales
   no han sido eliminadas. Evaluamos patrones en los niveles de plomo en
   sangre de 1997 a 2011 y evaluamos un amplio rango factores putativos de
   riesgo demografico, conductual y ambiental por exposicion a niveles
   elevados de plomo en condores de California reintroducidos en California
   (E.U.A.). Tambien evaluamos la efectividad de las regulaciones para el
   uso de municiones de plomo en el rango de distribucion de Condores
   mediante la comparacion de niveles de plomo en la sangre antes y despues
   de la implementacion de las regulaciones. La exposicion a plomo fue una
   amenaza constante para los condores de California a pesar de las
   regulaciones que establecen el uso de municiones sin plomo.
   Adicionalmente. Los niveles de plomo incrementaron significativamente a
   medida que aumentaba la edad y la independencia de manejo intensivo,
   incluyendo el incremento del tiempo lejos de sitios de liberacion, y el
   decremento en la dependencia en el aprovisionamiento de alimento. Por lo
   tanto, una mayor independencia en un mayor numero de condores
   reintroducidos, a la fecha ha incrementado el riesgo de exposicion a
   plomo en la poblacion y limitado la efectividad de los esfuerzos para la
   reduccion de plomo. Nuestros resultados resaltan los retos para el
   restablecimiento de poblaciones de condores a medida que maduran y se
   vuelven menos dependientes de las acciones de manejo necesarias para
   compensar las amenazas persistentes.},

Title = {Identifying potential areas for an expanding wolf population in Sweden},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {220},
Pages = {170-181},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Large carnivores have historically been decreasing worldwide, often as a
   result of human-carnivore conflicts. However, large carnivores are
   recovering throughout Europe, and European management scenarios can
   provide important insights into broad issues related to human-large
   carnivore existence. After becoming almost extinct in Sweden during the
   mid-19th century the Swedish grey wolf (Canis lupus) population has now
   recovered. Current national wolf management aims to promote distribution
   shifts from the current areas in central Sweden, potentially also into a
   previously exempt reindeer husbandry area. Prior wolf re-introductions
   have highlighted the necessity of pro-active management for colonization
   success. Identification of likely range expansion areas could therefore
   be paramount for a successful Swedish wolf management. We characterized
   the demographic and spatial progression of Swedish wolves during
   2001-2015 and used a MaxEnt approach to species distribution models to
   identify potential range expansion areas. The Swedish wolf population
   had expanded from 10 to almost 60 reproductions or territorial pairs,
   and increased in both range size and density. Our distribution models
   suggested that Swedish wolf management may face trade-offs between costs
   of hosting wolves in densely populated areas in southern Sweden with
   cattle and sheep and the costs of allowing wolves to expand into
   reindeer husbandry areas with associated cultural and economic
   consequences. Spatially explicit data on the economic, social and
   cultural factors associated with wolf conflict and acceptance may be
   paramount for developing optimal management strategies in the face of
   such a trade-off.},

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1723-1743},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the last decades, populations of large carnivores have been making a
   spectacular return, especially in the USA and Western Europe. These
   population recoveries result partially from protective legislation and
   reintroduction programs, but possibly also from land use changes and
   from large carnivores adapting to human environments. Although public
   support for large carnivore protection seems to be growing, some
   stakeholders still have a negative perception of large carnivores
   because of their alleged negative impacts on livestock and humans.
   Perceptions of large carnivores are partly determined by underlying
   visions of nature which differ between stakeholder groups. We therefore
   examined the relationship between different stakeholder groups'
   perceptions of nature and the presence of the fox (Vulpes vulpes), and
   the possible establishment of the wolf (Canis lupus) and lynx (Lynx
   lynx) in a Dutch riverine landscape. Stakeholder groups comprised the
   general public, farmers, scientists and nature conservationists.
   Although perceptions of large carnivores differed significantly across
   the stakeholder groups, public support for large carnivores was
   generally higher than expected. Farmers show the most negative
   perception, especially regarding the wolf and lynx. This is related to
   their vision of nature, which is more strongly aligned with mastery over
   nature compared to other stakeholder groups. Scientists, prominent
   adherers of stewardship of nature, appear to have the most positive
   perception of large carnivores. Despite these differences in visions of
   nature, respondents generally adhere to the stewardship of nature
   relationship. This could be a good starting point to find common ground
   when disputes arise over large carnivores.},

Title = {Using spatial characteristics of apex carnivore communication and
   reproductive behaviors to predict responses to future human development},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2589-2603},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A growing body of evidence has documented how wildlife alter their
   behavior in response to human encroachment. For carnivores, behaviors
   related to reproduction and communication are particularly sensitive to
   human disturbance and can provide an early warning indicator of
   development's negative impacts. Despite the important role carnivores
   play in an ecosystem, few tools have been developed to anticipate how
   future human development impacts these behaviors. We developed a set of
   models to understand spatial relationships between anthropogenic
   development and puma (Puma concolor) habitat selection for two critical
   reproductive behaviors: nursery habitat for raising young, and sites for
   communication with mates. Using geospatial location data from the Santa
   Cruz Mountains in California, USA, we found that female pumas use small
   nursery home ranges (9 km(2) +/- 1.72 SE) of predominantly natural
   habitat, potentially with low levels of human development (< 1 housing
   unit per 40 acres), when supporting kittens < 8 weeks old. Areas
   immediately surrounding (<= 600 m) puma communication sites were also
   almost entirely composed of undeveloped habitat or low-density
   development. When modeling projected human development compared to
   current land use, we found that increases in human development may
   eliminate 20\% of current puma nursery habitat and nearly 50\% of
   current communication site habitat. Future development will also
   increase the patchiness of suitable habitat, intensifying the difficulty
   of locating and accessing suitable areas for nurseries and
   communication. Focusing on the habitat needed to support reproductive
   and communication behaviors may be an effective way to prioritize
   conservation planning for pumas and other apex carnivores.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Understanding how exposure and information affect public attitudes
   towards returning large carnivores in Europe is critical for
   human-carnivore coexistence, especially for developing efficient and
   de-escalating communication strategies. The ongoing recolonization of
   wolves (Canis lupus) in Germany provides a unique opportunity to test
   the role of different information sources and trust on people's
   attitudes towards wolves. We conducted a phone survey (n = 1250) and
   compared country-wide attitudes towards wolves with attitudes in a
   specific region where wolves initially recolonized and have been present
   since 2000. In particular, we investigate the relationship between
   information sources, trust and people's attitudes while accounting for
   factors like knowledge, exposure and socio-cultural determinants of
   respondents. We found significant differences in attitudes and knowledge
   about wolves as well as in the use and frequency of information sources
   between the two population samples. Higher knowledge, information from
   books and films, science-based information, and higher trust in
   information sources related positively with positive attitudes towards
   wolves. Comparatively, information from press or TV news was associated
   with more negative attitudes. Providing science-based information to the
   public and building trust in information is likely to be one measure,
   among others, to dampen extreme attitudes and improve people's
   appreciation of costs and benefits of human-carnivore coexistence.
   Management of conflictual situations emerging from large carnivore
   recolonization in Europe and beyond should consider incorporating
   assessments of people's use of and trust in information in addition to
   existing tools to pave new ways for constructive human-carnivore
   coexistence.},

Title = {Raging elephants: effects of human disturbance on physiological stress
   and reproductive potential in wild Asian elephants},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Human disturbance has become a widespread threat to wildlife viability.
   The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), an endangered and
   disturbance-prone species, is under severe threat from habitat loss and
   fragmentation, human-elephant conflict and poaching. Establishing
   connections between human disturbance, stress responses and reproduction
   is crucial for assessing the long-term survivability of a species and
   will provide critical information for conservation management. The
   current study investigated the effects of human disturbance on
   population-level stress responses and stress-related effects on
   reproductive potential of wild Asian elephants in Xishuangbanna Dai
   Autonomous Prefecture, China. We used a radioimmunoassay to measure the
   concentration of fecal cortisol and estradiol in 257 samples collected
   from five local populations at 15 sites over 4 years. Human disturbance
   in Xishuangbanna was quantified based on the Ecological-Niche Factor
   Analysis model. We found that fecal cortisol concentrations were
   strongly positively correlated with the degree of human disturbance and
   increased markedly with the expansion of tea plantations. Percentage of
   non-stressed individuals in a population was higher depending on the
   extend of undisturbed area in their home ranges. Fecal estradiol
   concentrations decreased significantly with increasing stress levels.
   Our results suggest that human disturbance poses environmental
   challenges to wild Asian elephant populations, and chronic exposure to
   human disturbance could lead to population decline. The study
   demonstrates the efficacy of non-invasive endocrine monitoring for
   further informing management decisions and developing conservation
   strategies.},

Title = {Wolf predation on cattle in Portugal: Assessing the effects of husbandry
   systems},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {207},
Pages = {17-26},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mitigating conflicts associated with predation on livestock is essential
   for conserving large carnivores in human dominated landscapes. This is
   generally addressed by targeting at individual management practices
   affecting predation risk, often disregarding that different livestock
   husbandry systems (i.e groups of farms sharing similar resource bases,
   production patterns and management practices) with different
   vulnerabilities to predation may coexist within predator ranges, each of
   which requiring tailored prescriptions to reduce predation. Here we
   evaluated the importance of considering both husbandry systems and
   individual management practices to mitigate conflicts due to cattle
   predation by wolves in Portugal, where attacks on cattle increased >3
   times in 1999-2013. Government records from 2012 to 2013 indicated that
   only <2\% of cattle farms suffered wolf attacks, of which <4\% had >10
   attacks per year. We found that attacks were concentrated in the
   free-ranging husbandry system, which was characterized by multi-owner
   herds, largely grazing communal land far from shelter, and seldom
   confined. Protecting these herds at night in winter was the most
   important factor reducing wolf attackS, which could be achieved by
   changing practices of approximate to 25\% of farmers in this system.
   Attacks Were much lower in the semi-confined system, probably because
   herds grazed pastures closer to shelter, and they were often confined
   with fences or in barns. Farms bringing calves <3 months old to pastures
   were associated with about 90\% of attacks, but changing this practice
   would involve approximate to 50\% of farmers in this system. Our results
   underline the importance of identifying livestock husbandry systems and
   to adjust mitigation strategies to each system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Wetlands are ecologically and economically important ecosystems with
   high conservation value. Although wetland vegetation is strongly
   determined by abiotic factors, grazing disturbance may also be an
   important influence on this community. We evaluated the effects of
   livestock grazing on wetland vegetation in marsh and wet meadow zones in
   intermountain depressional wetlands in the southern interior of British
   Columbia, Canada. We sampled marshes and wet meadows in 36 wetlands
   along a grazing intensity gradient ranging from fully fenced and
   ungrazed wetlands to unfenced wetlands heavily grazed by livestock. The
   amount of bare ground was used as a surrogate measure of the intensity
   of livestock grazing. Vegetation community structure and composition was
   strongly associated with grazing intensity. Increased livestock grazing
   favored shorter-lived and smaller plants: conversely, the frequency of
   tall and rhizomatous species, which constitute the dominant plant
   species in these systems, declined with higher livestock use. The
   effects of grazing were more pronounced in the marsh than in the wet
   meadow. Associations between species richness and grazing differed
   between zones: native and exotic species richness showed a unimodal
   response in the marsh while in the wet meadow exotic richness increased
   and native richness showed no response. The relationship between exotic
   frequency and grazing was also inconsistent between zones, with a
   negative association in the marsh and a positive but weak association in
   the wet meadow. Grazing-related changes in vegetation along the grazing
   intensity gradient were substantial and may affect the habitat value of
   these wetlands for dependent wildlife such as breeding waterfowl. (C)

Title = {Snow leopard predation in a livestock dominated landscape in Mongolia},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {184},
Pages = {251-258},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Livestock predation is an important cause of endangerment of the snow
   leopard (Panthera uncia) across its range. Yet, detailed information on
   individual and spatio-temporal variation in predation patterns of snow
   leopards and their kill rates of livestock and wild ungulates are
   lacking.
   We collared 19 snow leopards in the Tost Mountains, Mongolia, and
   searched clusters of GPS positions to identify prey remains and estimate
   kill rate and prey choice.
   Snow leopards killed, on average, one ungulate every 8 days, which
   included more wild prey (73\%) than livestock (27\%), despite livestock
   abundance being at least one order of magnitude higher. Predation on
   herded livestock occurred mainly on stragglers and in rugged areas where
   animals are out of sight of herders. The two wild ungulates, ibex (Capra
   ibex) and argali (Ovis ammon), were killed in proportion to their
   relative abundance. Predation patterns changed with spatial (wild
   ungulates) and seasonal (livestock) changes in prey abundance. Adult
   male snow leopards killed larger prey and 2-6 times more livestock
   compared to females and young males. Kill rates were considerably higher
   than previous scat-based estimates, and kill rates of females were
   higher than kill rates of males. We suggest that (i) snow leopards prey
   largely on wild ungulates and kill livestock opportunistically, (ii)
   retaliatory killing by livestock herders is likely to cause greater
   mortality of adult male snow leopards compared to females and young
   males, and (iii) total off-take of prey by a snow leopard population is
   likely to be much higher than previous estimates suggest. (C) 2015

Title = {Incorporating mortality into habitat selection to identify secure and
   risky habitats for savannah elephants},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {164},
Pages = {98-106},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Empirical models of habitat selection are increasingly used to guide and
   inform habitat-based management plans for wildlife species. However,
   habitat selection does not necessarily equate to habitat quality
   particularly if selection is maladaptive, so incorporating measures of
   fitness into estimations of occurrence is necessary to increase model
   robustness. Here, we incorporated spatially explicit mortality events
   with the habitat selection of elephants to predict secure and risky
   habitats in northern Botswana. Following a two-step approach, we first
   predict the relative probability of use and the relative probability of
   mortality based on landscape features using logistic regression models.
   Combining these two indices, we then identified low mortality and high
   use (primary habitat) and areas of high mortality and high use (primary
   risk). We found that mortalities of adult elephants were closely
   associated with anthropogenic features, with 80\% of mortalities
   occurring within 25 km of people. Conversely, elephant habitat selection
   was highest at distances of 30-50 km from people. Primary habitat for
   elephants occurred in the central portion of the study area and within
   the Okavango Delta; whereas risky areas occurred along the periphery
   near humans. The protected designation of an area had less influence on
   the proportion of prime habitat therein than did the locations of the
   area in relation to human development. Elephant management in southern
   Africa is moving towards a more self-sustaining, habitat-based approach,
   and information on selection and mortality could serve as a baseline to
   help identify demographic sources and sinks to stabilize elephant
   demography. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Predicting carnivore habitat use and livestock depredation risk with
   false-positive multi-state occupancy models},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {271},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The cycle of livestock depredation and retaliatory killing constitutes a
   major threat to large carnivores worldwide and imposes considerable
   hardships on human communities. Mitigation efforts are often undertaken
   with little knowledge of ecological underpinnings and patterns of
   depredation, limiting conservationists' ability to develop, prioritize,
   and evaluate solutions. Carnivore detection and depredation data from
   interviews in affected communities may help address this gap, but such
   data are often prone to false-positive uncertainty. To address these
   challenges in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan we collected snow
   leopard, lynx, wolf, and bear detection and depredation reports from
   local communities via semi-structured interviews. We used a novel
   hierarchical multispecies multi-state occupancy model that accounted for
   potential false-positives to investigate carnivore site use and
   depredation concurrently with respondents' apparent vulnerability to
   that risk. Estimated false-positive probabilities were small, but
   failure to account for them overstated site use probabilities and
   depredation risk for all species. Although individual vulnerability was
   low, depredation was nonetheless commonplace. Carnivore site use was
   driven by clear habitat associations, but we did not identify any
   clearly important large-scale spatial correlates of depredation risk
   despite considerable spatial variation in that risk. Respondents who
   sheltered livestock in household corrals reinforced with wire mesh were
   less likely to report snow leopard depredations. Reducing depredation
   and retaliation at adequately large scales in the Pamirs will likely
   require a portfolio of species-specific strategies, including widespread
   proactive corral improvements. Our approach expanded inference on the
   often-cryptic processes surrounding human-carnivore conflict even though

Title = {Seasonal herding practices influence predation on domestic stock by
   African lions along a protected area boundary},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {191},
Pages = {546-554},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Livestock depredation frequently results in retaliatory killing of
   carnivores by people. An understanding of the ecological and
   sociological factors that precipitate this conflict is essential to
   mitigation. We investigated the seasonality of lion (Panthera leo)
   depredation incidents in relation to cattle (Bos primigenius) herding
   patterns in Tsholotsho Communal Land and Ngamo Forest adjacent to Hwange
   National Park, Zimbabwe. Cattle from 14 villages along the protected
   area (PA) boundaries were fitted with GPS data loggers (2010-2012), and
   depredation incidents systematically recorded (2008-2012). More cattle
   were killed by lions during the wet season (October to May) than during
   the dry months (June to September). In the wetter months, corresponding
   to the growing season and the need to protect crops, cattle were herded
   further from their home enclosures, closer to PA boundaries and into
   more wooded habitats. By contrast, cattle remained closer to home,
   further from PM and were left to graze in fallow fields close to
   villages in the dry months. Seasonal use of wooded areas distant to
   villages and close to PA boundaries during the growing season increases
   vulnerability of cattle to lion depredation. In the dry months, cattle
   grazing close to villages benefit from the close proximity of people,
   resulting in a lower incidence of depredation. Approaches to mitigate
   livestock depredation should focus on improving herd protection during
   the wet season when cattle graze far from Villages. Strategies such as
   communal herding, more intensive livestock guarding and, where possible,
   avoidance of heavily wooded habitats close to PAs should be encouraged.

Title = {Human wildlife conflict involving large carnivores in Qilianshan, China
   and the minimal paw-print of snow leopards},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {187},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this paper, we assess local perceptions towards snow leopards in
   North West China using a framework depicting key conflict domains. We
   describe the perceived threats posed to humans by the snow leopard and
   set them within beliefs and attitudes towards other species within the
   large carnivore assemblage in this region. Surveys were conducted in
   seven villages within Qilianshan National Nature Reserve, Gansu
   Province, China, to document reports of snow leopard (Panthera uncia),
   grey wolf (Canis lupus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and brown bear (Ursus
   arctos) depredation of livestock, and local attitudes towards each
   species. Questionnaire-based interviews were held with 60 households and
   49 livestock herders. Herding of yak, sheep and goats was found to be a
   common livelihood activity among households in all villages. Herders
   reported losing livestock to all four carnivore species. Herders
   reported that depredation was the most common event affecting livestock,
   compared with natural disasters or disease, and represented a total loss
   of 3.6\% of the livestock population during the previous year. Most
   (53\%) depredation losses were attributed to lynx, while snow leopards
   were held responsible for only 7.8\% of depredation losses. The reported
   impact of snow leopards on herding activities was relatively small and
   the majority of both householders and herders expressed positive
   attitudes towards them and supported measures for their protection.
   Households and herders held negative attitudes towards lynx, wolves and
   bears, however, most likely due to their perceived threat to livestock
   and humans. Understanding community perceptions of threats posed by
   wildlife is vital for gaining community support for, and engagement in,
   conflict mitigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Shifting perceptions of risk and reward: Dynamic selection for human
   development by black bears in the western United States},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {187},
Pages = {164-172},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As landscapes across the globe experience increasing human development,
   it is critical to identify the behavioral responses of wildlife to this
   change given associated shifts in resource availability and risk from
   human activity. This is particularly important for large carnivores as
   their interactions with people are often a source of conflict, which can
   impede conservation efforts and require extensive management. To examine
   the adaptations of a large carnivore to benefits and risks associated
   with human development we investigated black bear behavior in three
   systems in the western United States. Our objectives were to (1)
   identify temporal patterns of selection for development within a year
   and across years based on natural food conditions, (2) compare spatial
   patterns of selection for development across systems, and (3) examine
   individual characteristics associated with increased selection for
   development. Using mixed effects resource selection models we found that
   bear selection for development was highly dynamic, varying as a function
   of changing environmental and physiological conditions. Bears increased
   their use of development in years when natural foods were scarce,
   throughout the summer-fall, as they aged, and as a function of gender,
   with males exhibiting greater use of development. While patterns were
   similar across systems, bears at sites with poorer quality habitat
   selected development more consistently than bears at sites with higher
   quality habitat. Black bears appear to use development largely for food
   subsidy, suggesting that conflicts with bears, and potentially other
   large carnivores, will increase when the physiological demand for
   resources outweighs risks associated with human activity. Published by

Title = {Urbanization decreases the extent and variety of leaf herbivory for
   native canopy tree species Quercus rubra, Quercus alba, and Acer
   saccharum},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5},
Pages = {907-916},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The extent to which urban trees can support associated biodiversity and
   provide ecosystem services depends on how urbanization affects the
   relationship between plants and the herbivorous arthropods that feed on
   them. Previous studies suggest that urbanization tends to increase the
   abundance, but decrease the diversity of herbivorous arthropods, but
   also reveal that this pattern may be an artifact of a narrow focus on
   pests and ornamental plants. We aimed to assess the effect of
   urbanization on whole leaf herbivore communities of three native canopy
   trees, red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Quercus alba), and sugar
   maple (Acer saccharum). For each species we compared the extent of
   herbivory (assessed as percent leaf loss) and diversity of herbivores
   (using the number of identifiable damage types as a proxy for feeding
   guild diversity) between sites in southeast Michigan that were more
   forested vs. more urbanized (with lower tree density and canopy coverage
   and higher percent hardscape and turf). We found that across all three
   species and sites compared, both the percent leaf area lost to herbivory
   and the number of different types of herbivory were consistently and
   significantly higher in forested than urbanized sites. While future
   studies are needed to confirm the mechanisms responsible, we conclude
   that at least for native canopy tree species, trees in more urbanized
   sites do not appear to experience higher herbivory, and instead support
   diminished herbivore communities compared to the same trees in a more
   forested setting.},

   of habitat suitability for common gartersnakes},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Measuring habitat suitability is important in conservation and in
   wildlife management. Measuring the abundance or presence-absence of a
   species in various habitats is not sufficient to measure habitat
   suitability because these metrics can be poor predictors of population
   success. Therefore, having some measure of population success is
   essential in assessing habitat suitability, but estimating population
   success is difficult. Identifying suitable proxies for population
   success could thus be beneficial. We examined whether faecal
   corticosterone metabolite (fCM) concentrations could be used as a proxy
   for habitat suitability in common gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis). We
   conducted a validation study and confirmed that fCM concentrations
   indeed reflect circulating corticosterone concentrations. We estimated
   abundance, reproductive output and growth rate of gartersnakes in field
   and in forest habitat and we also measured fCM concentrations of
   gartersnakes from these same habitats. Common gartersnakes were more
   abundant and had higher reproductive outputs and higher growth rates in
   field habitat than in forest habitat, but fCM concentrations did not
   differ between the same two habitats. Our results suggest either that
   fCM concentrations are not a useful metric of habitat suitability in
   common gartersnakes or that the difference in suitability between the
   two habitats was too small to induce changes in fCM concentrations.
   Incorporating fitness metrics in estimates of habitat suitability is
   important, but these metrics of fitness have to be sensitive enough to
   vary between habitats.},

Abstract = {The thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), one of Australia's most
   characteristic megafauna, was the largest marsupial carnivore until
   hunting, and potentially disease, drove it to extinction in 1936.
   Although thylacines were restricted to Tasmania for 2 millennia prior to
   their extinction, recent so-called plausible sightings on the Cape York
   Peninsula in northern Queensland have emerged, leading some to speculate
   the species may have persisted undetected. We compiled a data set that
   included physical evidence, expert-validated sightings, and unconfirmed
   sightings up to the present day and implemented a range of extinction
   models (focusing on a Bayesian approach that incorporates all 3 types of
   data by modeling valid and invalid sightings as independent processes)
   to evaluate the likelihood of the thylacine's persistence. Although the
   last captive individual died in September 1936, our results suggested
   that the most likely extinction date would be 1940. Our other extinction
   models estimated the thylacine's extinction date between 1936 and 1943,
   and the most optimistic scenario indicated that the species did not
   persist beyond 1956. The search for the thylacine, much like similar
   efforts to rediscover other recently extinct charismatic taxa, is likely
   to be fruitless, especially given that persistence on Tasmania would
   have been no guarantee the species could reappear in regions that had
   been unoccupied for millennia. The search for the thylacine may become a
   rallying point for conservation and wildlife biology and could
   indirectly help fund and support critical research in understudied areas
   such as Cape York. However, our results suggest that attempts to
   rediscover the thylacine will be unsuccessful and that the continued
   survival of the thylacine is entirely implausible based on most current
   mathematical theories of extinction.},

Title = {Factors determining the home ranges of pet cats: A meta-analysis},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {203},
Pages = {313-320},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Roaming pet cats Felis catus are a significant conservation issue
   because they may hunt, harass and compete with wildlife; spread disease,
   interbreed with cats in feral populations, and hybridise with wild
   native felids. Studies of the roaming behaviour of pet cats are often
   hampered by modest sample sizes and variability between cats, limiting
   statistical significance of the findings and their usefulness in
   recommending measures to discourage roaming. We resolved these
   difficulties through meta-analyses of 25 studies from 10 countries
   involving 469 pet cats to assess the influence of sex, whether a cat was
   desexed and housing density on roaming. A complementary linear mixed
   models approach used data on 311 individual animals from 22 studies and
   was also able to assess the influence of age and husbandry practices on
   roaming. This restricted sample gave greater statistical power than the
   meta-analyses.
   Meta-analyses found that: male pet cats had larger home ranges than
   females, desexing did not influence home range, and cats had larger home
   ranges when housing densities were low. The linear mixed models
   supported those results. They also indicated that animals years old had
   smaller home ranges than younger cats. Cats fed regularly, provided with
   veterinary care and socialised with humans had similar home ranges to
   cats living in association with households but not provided for in some
   of these ways. Short of confinement, there is no simple measure owners
   can adopt to reduce roaming by their cats and prevent the associated
   environmental problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Is anthropogenic cougar mortality compensated by changes in natural
   mortality in Utah? Insight from long-term studies},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {182},
Pages = {187-196},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding the interplay between exploitation and natural mortality
   is essential to guiding sustainable conservation of wildlife.
   Exploitation of carnivores by humans has long been thought to result in
   compensatory reductions of natural mortality among survivors. If rates
   of human exploitation exceed natural mortality, however, such actions
   will `add' to overall mortality and could imperil the sustainability of
   such actions. We applied competing risk analyses to >= 16 years of data
   for heavily harvested and semi-protected cougar populations in Utah to
   test the additive and compensatory mortality hypotheses, while
   accounting for parameter uncertainty. We additionally tested for
   presence of the two primary mechanisms by which compensatory mortality
   can arise: density dependence and individual heterogeneity in mortality
   risks. Despite an opportunity for compensation in the heavily harvested
   population, we could not reject the additive mortality hypothesis when
   uncertainty in parameter estimates was accounted for. In the
   semi-protected population, however, we detected evidence for partial
   compensation of increased anthropogenic exploitation via reductions in
   natural mortality. As may be common in carnivore studies, we found that
   ignoring uncertainty in estimates of cause-specific mortality
   systematically led to biased conclusions regarding additive and
   compensatory mortality hypotheses. Efforts should be made to address and
   minimize this uncertainty in demographic studies of carnivores in order
   to avoid flawed management recommendations. To attain the necessary
   sample sizes for making sound inference, this may require that the
   spatial extent of management units be extended for territorial species
   with large home-range requirements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Can supplemental food increase winter survival of a threatened
   cottontail rabbit?},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Populations of New England cottontails (Sylvilagus rransitionalis) have
   declined substantially in recent decades in response to habitat loss and
   fragmentation. Among some remnant populations, cottontails occupy small
   patches of thicket habitat where they experience high mortality rates as
   a consequence of limited food during winter. This limitation causes
   rabbits to forage away from cover where they are exposed to predators.
   Although conservation efforts are emerging to reverse the decline of New
   England cottontails, most are directed toward improving long-term
   viability by increasing the abundance of suitable habitats. Such efforts
   do little to improve the short-term survival of remaining cottontails.
   To address this immediate need, we evaluated the use of supplemental
   food as an approach to improve over-winter survival rates. We speculated
   that by positioning feeders in close proximity to escape cover, rabbits
   would be less vulnerable to predators. We evaluated this approach using
   eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus) as a research surrogate
   because this species is readily available and has similar habitat
   requirements to New England cottontails. Transmitter-equipped eastern
   cottontails were randomly assigned to either a fed or unfed group.
   Remotely-triggered cameras were also used to gauge use of feeders by
   cottontails and visits by other species. Winter survival rates were
   substantially greater for fed rabbits (70\%) than for unfed rabbits
   (32\%). Cameras revealed that rabbits were the most frequent consumer
   and that there was only limited carnivore activity near feeders. We
   conclude that supplemental feeding may improve survival of remaining New
   England cottontails as efforts to increase habitat availability continue
   to develop. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Community mapping of ecosystem services in tropical rainforest of
   Ecuador},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {460-471},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Tropical forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services (ES), and
   their continuous supply depends on efficient and effective management
   against deforestation and forest degradation. In Ecuador, indigenous
   communities are highly dependent on the forest and therefore on forest
   ES. However, there is a lack of knowledge about their demands concerning
   ES. In order to better understand how local and indigenous people use
   the forest and to facilitate its management, this study completed a
   spatially explicit assessment of ES using participatory mapping in the
   Sumaco Biosphere Reserve (Napo province, Central-Northern Ecuador). The
   Biosphere Reserve is suitable as a case study because it is a protected
   area with high land use and population pressure and therefore requires
   the development and monitoring of management plans.
   First, semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts (n= 15) in
   order to identify the most important ES used by the communities in the
   study area. In a second step, members (n = 208) of 24 communities were
   asked to indicate on a 3-D map where they utilize the different ES
   (food, wood, water, tourism, hunting). The highlighted localities were
   digitized and then analyzed with statistical and GIS techniques. The
   results showed that the ES locations were not randomly distributed, but
   were most abundant four kilometers or less from roads. Spatial pattern
   analysis identified hotspots of ES provision, and the evaluation
   according to administrative units allowed us to identify five
   municipalities where demand for all assessed ES was high. In conclusion,
   the combination of participatory mapping of ES and GIS-based analysis
   can facilitate the identification of priority protection areas, provide
   guidance for developing specific forest management strategies, and also
   support monitoring systems to detect forest degradation. (C) 2016

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {514-525},

Abstract = {Understanding the spatial dimensions of hunting and prey population
   dynamics is important in order to estimate the sustainability of hunting
   in tropical forests. We investigated how hunting offtake of vertebrates
   differed in mixed forest and monodominant forest (composed of
   Gilbertiodendron dewevrei) and over different spatial extents within the
   hunting catchment around the logging town of Kabo, Congo. In 9 months of
   recall surveys with hunters, we gathered information on over 1500
   hunting trips in which ungulates were 65\% of the species killed and
   82\% of harvested biomass. Hunters supplied information on animals
   killed and the hunting trip, including the area visited (i.e., hunting
   zone; 11 separate zones within a 506 km(2) catchment or commonly hunted
   area). Over 65\% of all animals were killed in monodominant forest,
   which made up 28\% of the hunting catchment, and zones with small
   amounts of monodominant forest were used most frequently by hunters.
   Given the large offtakes from monodominant forests, we suggest that
   animal dispersal may be maintaining high, localized harvests in these
   areas. We believe hunters preferred to hunt in monodominant forest
   because the understory was accessible and that areas with small amounts
   of monodominant forest and large amounts of mixed forest were more
   productive. The variation in hunting pressure we found between and
   within hunting zones differs from past examinations of spatial variation
   in hunting offtake, where entire hunting catchments were considered
   population sinks and areas with low to no hunting (no-take zones) were
   outside hunting catchments. Future use of no-take zones to manage
   hunting should incorporate variability in offtake within hunting
   catchments.},

   camera-trap monitoring coupled with capture-recapture analysis. Reliable
   regional density estimations of animal populations are required as a
   basis for management decisions. However, these estimations are affected
   by the session design, such as the length of the monitoring session,
   season, and number of trap sites. This method is regularly used to
   monitor Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) which mostly occupy the forested
   mountain ranges in Central Europe. Here we used intensive field sampling
   data of a major Central European lynx population to investigate (1) the
   optimal monitoring session length considering the trade-off between
   population closure and number of recaptures for density estimates, (2)
   the optimal time window within the year considering the stability of
   density estimates, detection probability, recapture number, and
   reproduction, and (3) the number of trap sites and trap spacing required
   to achieve robust density estimates. Using two closure tests, we found
   that 80 days are the minimum to ensure adequate data quality. A
   spatially explicit capture-recapture model revealed the best monitoring
   period to be late summer to early winter. Based on our results, we
   recommend for similar management units of comparable size (similar to
   300 km(2)) and similar recapture numbers to sample for at least 80 days
   in autumn with traps spaced about every 2.5-3 km. Our results also
   indicated that stable density estimates could still be maintained when
   the sampling area is enlarged to 760 km(2) with trap spacing every 5-6
   km if session lengths are increased.},

Abstract = {Tourist-induced behavioural changes in large vertebrates are of concern
   for protected area management as they trigger a trade-off: large
   vertebrates attract visitors, but induced behavioral changes can reduce
   animal fitness and cause animals to avoid tourist-frequented zones.
   Behavioural response of animals to tourists is often studied to ensure
   informed management decision-making, a task frequently supported by
   flight distance analysis. In this context, guanaco (Lama guanicoe)
   response to tourists was studied in a protected area using two
   complementary methods: flight distance and sighting frequency analyses.
   Flight response analyses show that guanacos develop a considerable
   tolerance to vehicles and pedestrians in tourist areas, a reaction that
   extends approximately 500 m around visited areas. Such analyses thus
   point to (i) few areas being underused as a consequence of human
   presence and (ii) a low risk of tame animals being poached outside the
   park, all potentially leading to the conclusion that tourist visits are
   sustainable. However, guanaco sighting frequencies during 107 fieldwork
   days along 3 years show a significant reduction in sightings on days
   with higher Park visitor numbers. Moreover we present a formal procedure
   for the definition of a threshold for this to happen (247 visitors/day
   in our case). This suggests the potential risk of negative effects on
   guanaco population and a lower probability of guanaco sightings if Park
   visitor numbers rise beyond current figures. Results allow to conclude
   that assessment of human disturbance to flagship species in protected
   areas requires further methods in addition to flight distance.},

Title = {Age structure as an indicator of poaching pressure: Insights from rapid

Abstract = {Detecting and monitoring illegal harvesting pressure on wild populations
   is challenging due to the cryptic nature of poaching activities.
   Although change in population age structure has been suggested as an
   indicator of harvesting pressure, few studies have tested its validity
   when based on short-term field surveys. Using data from rapid
   demographic assessment surveys carried out in 2009 at six sites in
   Tanzania, we examined whether African elephant populations experiencing
   contrasting levels of poaching pressure showed significant differences
   in their age structure, operational sex ratio (i.e. adult males to adult
   females), dependent individual to adult female ratio at the group level,
   and proportion of tuskless individuals. We also compared similar metrics
   between the population sampled in Ruaha National Park in 2009 and again
   in 2015 following a suspected increase in poaching. Elephant populations
   experiencing medium and high levels of poaching in 2009 were
   characterised by fewer calves and old individuals, a reduced number of
   adult males relative to adult females, and a lower ratio of calves to
   adult females within groups. We also found a higher proportion of
   tuskless individuals in poached populations ( > 6\%). Changes in age
   structure in the Ruaha population between 2009 and 15 were similar to
   those observed across sites in 2009. Our findings are consistent with
   previous work documenting how the loss of older individuals - targeted
   for their larger tusks - decreases recruitment and survival of elephant
   calves. Illegal killing for ivory is a huge threat to the survival of
   African elephants. In this context, the present study contributes
   towards validating the use of age structure as an indicator of poaching
   pressure in elephant populations, but also in other wildlife populations
   where illegal offtake is targeted at specific age classes.},

   Conservation planning},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Predation on livestock is one of the main factors that cause the felids
   hunting, in particular for puma and jaguar this conflict with humans is
   severe. Most studies have assessed the predation impacts on livestock
   production; however there is a spatial pattern in attacks occurrence
   that is feasible to analyze from ecological niche modeling. The
   objective of this research was to generate a risk model of livestock
   predation by puma and jaguar in Mexico based on environmental and
   livestock management variables, which allows identification of zones of
   risk in order to define mitigation strategies at national level. We
   produced a geographic ensemble model of risk of predation from three
   algorithms for jaguar and five for puma. The variables most positively
   related with predation risk by jaguar were vegetative cover percentage,
   percentage of free grazing animals, and altitude, whereas arid
   vegetation has a negative influence on predation risk. In the case of
   puma the variables with highest contribution were livestock density,
   which negatively influences on the predation risk, in addition to forest
   and altitude, both with a positive relation. The ensemble models are an
   accurate approach to delineating the zones of predation risk by felids;
   however at a regional scale the environmental characteristics that favor
   predation may be different. It is recommended that researchers carry out
   studies for each biogeographic province that facilitate the
   identification of specific patterns and the definition of mitigation
   strategies most suitable for each one. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {60-68},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Wide-ranging, landscape-level movements by terrestrial herbivores are
   increasingly threatened globally. Understanding the ecology of
   spatio-temporal movement patterns is critical for conservation of
   wide-ranging terrestrial species and the ecosystems on which they rely.
   The range of the Gourma elephant population inhabiting the Sahelian
   eco-region near Tombouctou (Timbuktu), Mali encompasses the largest
   areal extent in this species (29\% greater than range sizes reported in
   other populations). Over the course of a year, the Gourma elephants
   (Loxodonta africana) move in a coordinated north-south movement pattern
   that is relatively unique for the species. We apply two new approaches
   to this system to characterize space use patterns; a time-density
   algorithm that provides a probability surface of normalized time spent
   per unit grid cell of GPS tracked animals and a velocity-grid algorithm
   that summarizes linear movements (directions, speeds and directional
   similarity) in cartographic form. The derived movement vector raster was
   analyzed using standard clustering methods to categorize areas by
   movement properties. Using these techniques we inferred regions of
   relative ecological importance to the Gourma elephants, protection of
   which is essential for the preservation of this unique terrestrial
   movement system. Analysis suggests the observed spatio-temporal pattern
   is a complex function of availability of surface water, vegetation
   productivity (as measured using the Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index, NDVI) and possibly vegetation nutrient content. The approaches
   and applications demonstrated here can further our understanding of the
   movement ecology of other wildlife landscapes and facilitate the
   identification of crux points for their improved management. (C) 2012

Abstract = {Many animal populations that are endangered in mainland areas exist in
   stable island populations, which have the potential to act as an
   ``ark{''} in case of mainland population declines. Previous studies have
   found neutral genetic variation in such species to be up to an order of
   magnitude lower in island compared to mainland populations. If low
   genetic variation is prevalent across fitness-related loci, this would
   reduce the effectiveness of island populations as a source of
   individuals to supplement declining mainland populations or re-establish
   extinct mainland populations. One such species, the black-footed
   rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis lateralis), exists within fragmented
   mainland populations and small island populations off Western Australia.
   We examined sequence variation in this species within a fitness-related
   locus under positive selection, the MHC class II DAB beta 1 locus. The
   mainland populations displayed greater levels of allelic diversity (4-7
   alleles) than the island population, despite being small and isolated,
   and contained at least two DAB gene copies. The island population
   displayed low allelic diversity (2 alleles) and fewer alleles per
   individual in comparison to mainland populations, and probably possesses
   only one DAB gene copy. The patterns of DAB diversity suggested that the
   island population has a markedly lower level of genetic variation than
   the mainland populations, in concordance with results from
   microsatellites (genotyped in a previous study), but preserved unique
   alleles which were not found in mainland populations. Where possible,
   conservation actions should pool individuals from multiple populations,
   not only island populations, for translocation programs, and focus on
   preventing further declines in mainland populations.},

Abstract = {Coastal marshes are one of the world's most productive ecosystems.
   Consequently, they have been heavily used by humans for centuries,
   resulting in ecosystem loss. Direct human modifications such as road
   crossings and ditches and climatic stressors such as sea-level rise and
   extreme storm events have the potential to further degrade the quantity
   and quality of marsh along coastlines. We used an 18-year marsh-bird
   database to generate population trends for 5 avian species (Rallus
   crepitans, Tringa semipalmata semipalmata, Ammodramus nelsonii
   subvirgatus, Ammodramus caudacutus, and Ammodramus maritimus) that breed
   almost exclusively in tidal marshes, and are potentially vulnerable to
   marsh degradation and loss as a result of anthropogenic change. We
   generated community and species trends across 3 spatial scales and
   explored possible drivers of the changes we observed, including marsh
   ditching, tidal restriction through road crossings, local rates of
   sea-level rise, and potential for extreme flooding events. The
   specialist community showed negative trends in tidally restricted
   marshes (-2.4\% annually from 1998 to 2012) but was stable in
   unrestricted marshes across the same period. At the species level, we
   found negative population trends in 3 of the 5 specialist species,
   ranging from -4.2\% to 9.0\% annually. We suggest that tidal restriction
   may accelerate degradation of tidal marsh resilience to sea-level rise
   by limiting sediment supply necessary for marsh accretion, resulting in
   specialist habitat loss in tidally restricted marshes. Based on our
   findings, we predict a collapse of the global population of Saltmarsh
   Sparrows (A. caudacutus) within the next 50 years and suggest that
   immediate conservation action is needed to prevent extinction of this
   species. We also suggest mitigation actions to restore sediment supply
   to coastal marshes to help sustain this ecosystem into the future.
   Predictores de la Declinacion de Avifauna Especialista en Humedales
   Costeros Los humedales costeros son uno de los ecosistemas mas
   productivos en el mundo. Consecuentemente, han sido utilizados
   intensivamente por los humanos durante siglos, resultando en la perdida
   del ecosistema. Modificaciones humanas directas como caminos y zanjas,
   asi como agentes climaticos estresantes como el incremento del nivel del
   mar y eventos de tormentas extremas tienen el potencial de degradar aun
   mas la cantidad y calidad de humedales a lo largo de las costas.
   Utilizamos una base de datos de 18 anos de aves de humedal para generar
   tendencias poblaciones de especies de aves (Rallus crepitans, Tringa
   semipalmata semipalmata, Ammodramus nelsonii subvirgatus, A. caudacutus,
   y A. maritimus) que se reproducen casi exclusivamente en marismas y que
   son potencialmente vulnerables a la degradacion y perdida de humedales
   como resultado de cambios antropogenicos. Generamos tendencias de la
   comunidad y de especies en 3 escalas espaciales y exploramos los
   posibles factores de los cambios observados, incluyendo la construccion
   de canales, la restriccion de mareas por medio de caminos, tasas locales
   de incremento del nivel del mar y el potencial de eventos de inundacion
   extremos. La comunidad de especialistas mostro tendencias negativas en
   humedales restringidos por las mareas (-2.4\% anualmente de 1998 a
   2012), pero fue estable en humedales no restringidos. A nivel de
   especies, encontramos tendencias poblacionales negativas en 3 de las 5
   especies especialistas que variaron entre -4.2\% a 9\% anualmente.
   Sugerimos que la restriccion de mareas puede acelerar la degradacion de
   la resiliencia de marismas al incremento del nivel del mar al limitar el
   aporte de los sedimentos necesarios para la acrecion de marismas, lo
   cual resulta en la perdida de habitat en marismas restringidas por las
   mareas. Con base en nuestros resultados, pronosticamos un colapso de la
   poblacion global de A. caudacutus en los proximos 50 anos y sugerimos
   que se requieren acciones de conservacion inmediatas para prevenir la
   extincion de esta especie. Tambien sugerimos acciones de mitigacion para
   restaurar el aporte de sedimentos en los humedales costeros para ayudar
   a sostener este ecosistema en el futuro. Resumen},

Title = {First insights into the movements and vertical habitat use of blue
   marlin (Makaira nigricans) in the eastern North Atlantic},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {Background The blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) is a vulnerable migratory
   fish inhabiting tropical and subtropical pelagic waters of the Atlantic,
   Pacific and Indian Oceans. The biology and spatial ecology of the
   species in the eastern North Atlantic is poorly understood, despite
   being exploited in the region by recreational and commercial fisheries.
   Here, we present results of the first study to use pop-up satellite
   archival tags to track blue marlin off Madeira, Portugal (n = 3) and
   obtain insights into the movements and habitat use of the species within
   the eastern North Atlantic. Results Blue marlin were tracked for 24 to
   83 days, moving from Madeira to pelagic waters off the Canary Islands,
   Cape Verde Islands, as well as along the continental shelf brake of
   Europe and Africa. Blue marlin spent 71\% of their time in the upper 5 m
   and 89\% in the upper 50 m, though all individuals dived to depths over
   200 m (maximum: 336 m). Temperature at depth ranged from 12 to 28.6
   degrees C, but the greatest proportion of time was spent in waters
   between 20 and 26 degrees C. Detailed depth and temperature time-series
   data were obtained from a tag recovered eight years later. These data
   show clear diel differences in depth use, involving consistent use of
   the surface at night and deeper dive activity during the day,
   predominately to depths greater than 50 m. Conclusions The highly
   migratory patterns of this vulnerable species in the eastern North
   Atlantic highlights the need for both local and international
   conservation measures. Depth-use patterns, particularly the high usage
   of the upper 5 m of the water column, make them susceptible to surface
   longline fisheries.},

Title = {The number of shipments in the CITES Trade Database does not accurately
   reflect the volume of traded wildlife},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {253},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Volume estimation of the wildlife trade is crucial for effective
   biodiversity protection. Recently, Mair et al. (Biol. Conserv. 2019,
   239, 108260) used the number of shipments reported in the CITES Trade
   Database as an estimate of the total traded volume of species to rapidly
   assess the appropriateness of species listings in CITES Appendices. The
   aims of the present study were to (1) test the presumed relationship
   between the number of shipments and the volume of various traded terms
   converted to whole organism equivalents (WOEs) and (2) compare the
   distribution of species in defined trade volume categories based on
   different calculation methods. The number of shipments did not reflect
   traded volume in 15\% of species. Different calculation methods led to
   different categorisations for more than one-third of the species. In
   general, the number of shipments underestimates the volume of species
   traded in small-sized terms that allow trade in larger and less-frequent
   shipments and vice versa. In contrast, WOEs quantification does not
   consider the species that are traded in non-convertible terms (e. g.,
   meat) or units (e.g., kilograms). Due to the structure of the data in
   the CITES Trade Database, it is not possible to find the only objective
   method of trade quantification for the whole data set. However, we
   recommend to use shipments approach only to exclude species with zero
   trade, and evaluate the real volume using WOEs where possible.},

Title = {Global synthesis suggests that food web connectance correlates to
   invasion resistance},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {465-473},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Biological invasions are a key component of global change, and
   understanding the drivers of global invasion patterns will aid in
   assessing and mitigating the impact of invasive species. While invasive
   species are most often studied in the context of one or two trophic
   levels, in reality species invade communities comprised of complex food
   webs. The complexity and integrity of the native food web may be a more
   important determinant of invasion success than the strength of
   interactions between a small subset of species within a larger food web.
   Previous efforts to understand the relationship between food web
   properties and species invasions have been primarily theoretical and
   have yielded mixed results. Here, we present a synthesis of empirical
   information on food web connectance and species invasion success
   gathered from different sources (estimates of food web connectance from
   the primary literature and estimates of invasion success from the Global
   Invasive Species Database as well as the primary literature). Our
   results suggest that higher-connectance food webs tend to host fewer
   invaders and exert stronger biotic resistance compared to
   low-connectance webs. We argue that while these correlations cannot be
   used to infer a causal link between food web connectance and habitat
   invasibility, the promising findings beg for further empirical research
   that deliberately tests for relationships between food web connectance
   and invasion.},

Abstract = {The golden jackal, widely distributed in Europe, Asia and Africa, is one
   of the less studied carnivores in the world and the genetic structure of
   the European populations is unknown. In the last century jackals
   strongly declined mainly due to human persecution, but recently they
   expanded again in eastern Europe. With the aim to determine the genetic
   structure and the origin of expanding jackals, we analyzed population
   samples obtained from Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia (Dalmatia and Slavonia)
   and individuals sampled in north-eastern Italy. Samples were typed at
   the hypervariable part of the mitochondrial DNA control-region (mtDNA
   CR1) and at 15 canine autosomal microsatellite loci (STR), and analyzed
   using multivariate, Bayesian and landscape genetic methods. The mtDNA
   CR1 was monomorphic, showing a single haplotype shared among all the
   populations. The STR loci were variable, with 2-14 alleles and
   intermediate values of heterozygosity (Ho = 0.47; He = 0.51). Genetic
   diversity was significantly partitioned (theta(ST) = 0.07; P < 0.001)
   and the populations were partially distinct, perhaps in consequence of
   recent fragmentations. Jackals from Dalmatia were the most genetically
   differentiated. Assignment testing and gene flow analyses suggested that
   jackals colonizing Italy have admixed origins from Dalmatian and
   Slavonian populations. They are not first generation migrants,
   suggesting that dispersal towards northeastern Italy is a stepping-stone
   process. Golden jackal and wolf colonization patterns might be
   different, with prevalent short-distance dispersal in jackals versus
   prevalent long distance dispersal in wolves. The admixed origin of
   jackals in the Alps ensures abundant genetic variability, which may
   enhance adaptive fitness and expectancy of population growth. The
   intersections between Dinaric-Balkan and Eastern Alps are areas of
   population expansion and admixture, highlighting their conservation,
   ecological and evolutionary values.},

Title = {Perceptions of environmental changes and Lethargic crab disease among
   crab harvesters in a Brazilian coastal community},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Background: Lethargic Crab Disease (LCD) has caused significant
   mortalities in the population of Ucides cordatus crabs in the Mucuri
   estuary in Bahia State, Brazil, and has brought social and economic
   problems to many crab-harvesting communities that depend on this natural
   resource. The present work examined the perceptions of members of a
   Brazilian crab harvesting community concerning environmental changes and
   the Lethargic Crab Disease.
   Methods: Field work was undertaken during the period between January and
   April/2009, with weekly or biweekly field excursions during which open
   and semi-structured interviews were held with local residents in the
   municipality of Mucuri, Bahia State, Brazil. A total of 23 individuals
   were interviewed, all of whom had at least 20 years of crab-collecting
   experience in the study region. Key-informants (more experienced crab
   harvesters) were selected among the interviewees using the ``native
   specialist{''} criterion.
   Results: According to the collectors, LCD reached the Mucuri mangroves
   between 2004 and 2005, decimating almost all crab population in the
   area, and in 2007, 2008 and 2009 high mortalities of U. cordatus were
   again observed as a result of recurrences of this disease in the region.
   In addition to LCD, crabs were also suffering great stock reductions due
   to habitat degradation caused by deforestation, landfills, sewage
   effluents, domestic and industrial wastes and the introduction of exotic
   fish in the Mucuri River estuary. The harvesting community was found to
   have significant ecological knowledge about the functioning of mangrove
   swamp ecology, the biology of crabs, and the mass mortality that
   directly affected the economy of this community, and this information
   was largely in accordance with scientific knowledge.
   Conclusions: The study of traditional knowledge makes it possible to
   better understand human interactions with the environment and aids in
   the elaboration of appropriate strategies for natural resource
   conservation.},

Abstract = {The theory of planned behaviour was applied to study the attitude and
   intention of households towards participating in collective forest
   management (tree planting) activity. Households were randomly selected
   from 22 forest user groups. The results indicate that the success of
   planting activities in terms of survival rate of seedlings has a strong
   effect in motivating households to participate in planting. Although
   households in general show a positive attitude and intention to
   participate in tree planting, there were significant differences among
   households on the basis of socio-economic characteristics. Dependence on
   crop income, possession of bigger farmlands and better physical assets,
   and higher education level are positively related to intention to
   participate in planting activity. On the other hand, dependence on
   forest income is negatively related to attitude and intention. A
   continuous exchange of ideas and information between user groups and the
   government counterparts that provide technical support and advice is
   recommended.},

Title = {Maximum cardiac performance of Antarctic fishes that lack haemoglobin
   and myoglobin: exploring the effect of warming on nature's natural
   knockouts},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Antarctic notothenioids, some of which lack myoglobin (Mb) and/or
   haemoglobin (Hb), are considered extremely stenothermal, which raises
   conservation concerns since Polar regions are warming at unprecedented
   rates. Without reliable estimates of maximum cardiac output (((Q)over
   dot)), it is impossible to assess their physiological scope in response
   to warming seas. Therefore, we compared cardiac performance of two
   icefish species, Chionodraco rastrospinosus (Hb(-)Mb(+)) and
   Chaenocephalus aceratus (Hb(-)Mb(-)), with a related notothenioid,
   Notothenia coriiceps (Hb(+)Mb(+)) using an in situ perfused heart
   preparation. The maximum (Q)over dot, heart rate (f(H)), maximum cardiac
   work (WC) and relative ventricular mass of N. coriiceps at 1 degrees C
   were comparable to temperate-water teleosts, and acute warming to 4
   degrees C increased fH and WC, as expected. In contrast, icefish hearts
   accommodated a higher maximum stroke volume (VS) and maximum. Q at 1
   degrees C, but their unusually large hearts had a lower fH and maximum
   afterload tolerance than N. coriiceps at 1 degrees C. Furthermore,
   maximum VS, maximum. Q and fH were all significantly higher for the
   Hb(-)Mb(+) condition compared with the Hb(-)Mb(-) condition, a potential
   selective advantage when coping with environmental warming. Like N.
   coriiceps, both icefish species increased H-f at 4 degrees C. Acutely
   warming C. aceratus increased maximum (Q) over dot, while C.
   rastrospinosus (like N. coriiceps) held at 4 degrees C for 1 week
   maintained maximum. Q when tested at 4 degrees C. These experiments
   involving short-term warming should be followed up with long-term
   acclimation studies, since the maximum cardiac performance of these
   three Antarctic species studied seem to be tolerant of temperatures in
   excess of predictions associated with global warming.},

Title = {Camera-based occupancy monitoring at large scales: Power to detect
   trends in grizzly bears across the Canadian Rockies},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {201},
Pages = {192-200},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Monitoring carnivores is critical for conservation, yet challenging
   because they are rare and elusive. Few methods exist for monitoring
   wide-ranging species over large spatial and sufficiently long temporal
   scales to detect trends. Remote cameras are an emerging technology for
   monitoring large carnivores around the world because of their low cost,
   non-invasive methodology, and their ability to capture pictures of
   species of concern that are difficult to monitor. For species without
   uniquely identifiable spots, stripes, or other markings, cameras collect
   detection/non-detection data that are well suited for monitoring trends
   in occupancy as its own independent useful metric of species
   distribution, as well as an index for abundance. As with any new
   monitoring method, prospective power analysis is essential to ensure
   meaningful trends can be detected. Here we test camera-based occupancy
   models as a method to monitor changes in occupancy of a threatened
   species, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), at large landscape scales, across
   5 Canadian national parks (similar to 21,000 km(2)). With n = 183
   cameras, the top occupancy model estimated regional occupancy to be 0.79
   across all 5 parks. We evaluate the statistical power to detect
   simulated 5-40\% declines in occupancy between two sampling years and
   test applied questions of how power is affected by the spatial scale of
   interest (park level vs. regional level), the number of cameras
   deployed, and duration of camera deployment. We also explore several
   ecological mechanisms (i.e., spatial patterns) of decline in occupancy,
   and examine how power changes when focusing only on grizzly bears family
   groups. As hypothesized, statistical power increased with the number of
   cameras and with the number of days deployed. Power was unaffected,
   however, by the ecological mechanisms of decline, indicating that our
   systematic sampling design can detect a decline regardless of whether
   occupancy declined due to range edge attrition, ecological trap or other
   mechanisms. Despite their lower occupancy, power was similarly high for
   grizzly bear family groups compared to grizzly bears in general. We
   highlight which study design attributes contributed to high power and we
   provide advice for establishing cost-effective camera-based programs for
   monitoring large carnivore occupancy at large spatial scales. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Increasing risk of pathogen spillover coupled with overall declines in
   wildlife population abundance in the Anthropocene make infectious
   disease a relevant concern for species conservation worldwide. While
   emerging molecular tools could improve our diagnostic capabilities and
   give insight into mechanisms underlying wildlife disease risk, they have
   rarely been applied in practice. Here, employing a previously reported
   gene transcription panel of common immune markers to track physiological
   changes, we present a detailed analysis over the course of both acute
   and chronic infection in one wildlife species where disease plays a
   critical role in conservation, bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis).
   Differential gene transcription patterns distinguished between infection
   statuses over the course of acute infection and differential correlation
   (DC) analyses identified clear changes in gene co-transcription patterns
   over the early stages of infection, with transcription of four
   genes-TGFb, AHR, IL1b and MX1-continuing to increase even as
   transcription of other immune-associated genes waned. In a separate
   analysis, we considered the capacity of the same gene transcription
   panel to aid in differentiating between chronically infected animals and
   animals in other disease states outside of acute disease events (an
   immediate priority for wildlife management in this system). We found
   that this transcription panel was capable of accurately identifying
   chronically infected animals in the test dataset, though additional data
   will be required to determine how far this ability extends. Taken
   together, our results showcase the successful proof of concept and
   breadth of potential utilities that gene transcription might provide to
   wildlife disease management, from direct insight into mechanisms
   associated with differential disease response to improved diagnostic
   capacity in the field.},

   corresponding to the pathogenic species Leptospira interrogans was
   detected in 2/15 (13.3\%) of the samples tested. Sambar deer experience
   a high level of exposure to Leptospira spp. in our epidemiological

Title = {Ecosystem services from converted land: the importance of tree cover in
   Amazonian pastures},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {573-591},

Abstract = {Deforestation is responsible for a substantial fraction of global carbon
   emissions and changes in surface energy budgets that affect climate.
   Deforestation losses include wildlife and human habitat, and myriad
   forest products on which rural and urban societies depend for food,
   fiber, fuel, fresh water, medicine, and recreation. Ecosystem services
   gained in the transition from forests to pasture and croplands, however,
   are often ignored in assessments of the impact of land cover change. The
   role of converted lands in tropical areas in terms of carbon uptake and
   storage is largely unknown. Pastures represent the fastest-growing form
   of converted land use in the tropics, even in some areas of rapid urban
   expansion. Tree biomass stored in these areas spans a broad range,
   depending on tree cover. Trees in pasture increase carbon storage,
   provide shade for cattle, and increase productivity of forage material.
   As a result, increasing fractional tree cover can provide benefits land
   managers as well as important ecosystem services such as reducing
   conversion pressure on forests adjacent to pastures. This study presents
   an estimation of fractional tree cover in pasture in a dynamic region on
   the verge of large-scale land use change. An appropriate sampling
   interval is established for similar studies, one that balances the need
   for independent samples of sufficient number to characterize a pasture
   in terms of fractional tree cover. This information represents a useful
   policy tool for government organizations and NGOs interested in
   encouraging ecosystem services on converted lands. Using high spatial
   resolution remotely sensed imagery, fractional tree cover in pasture is
   quantified for the municipality of Rio Branco, Brazil. A semivariogram
   and devolving spatial resolution are employed to determine the coarsest
   sampling interval that may be used, minimizing effects of spatial
   autocorrelation. The coarsest sampling interval that minimizes spatial
   dependence was about 22 m. The area-weighted fractional tree cover for
   the study area was 1.85 \%, corrected for a slight bias associated with
   the coarser sampling resolution. The pastures sampled for fractional
   tree cover were divided between `high' and `low' tree cover, which may
   be the result of intentional incorporation of arboreal species in
   pasture. Further research involving those ranchers that have a higher
   fractional tree cover may indicate ways to promote the practice on a
   broader scale in the region.},

Abstract = {Urbanisation radically changes habitats and alters available resources.
   Populations of large, highly mobile species are often extirpated at the
   urban-wildland interface, while species like mesocarnivores may thrive
   by capitalising on changes in prey abundance. We investigated the diet
   of the caracal (Caracal caracal), a medium-sized felid inhabiting patchy
   natural habitat isolated within the dense urban matrix of South Africa's
   second largest city, Cape Town. We systematically integrated two classic
   dietary methods (scat and GPS clusters) by accounting for gut transit
   times. As part of a larger caracal ecology study, we GPS-collared 26
   individuals over a two-year period (2014-2016) to generate coarse
   (3-hour) and fine-scale (20-minute) GPS movement data. Using the
   movement data, we investigated 677 GPS-clusters for prey remains. We
   collected 654 scats, half of which were found at GPS-clusters and were
   linked with the individual sampled. By systematically correcting for a
   range of gut transit times, we determined whether scat at cluster sites
   was from the same or an earlier feeding event, thereby increasing the
   overall detection of feeding events by > 50\%. Avian prey dominated GPS
   cluster findings while micromammals were overwhelmingly represented in
   scat. Although > 40\% of feeding events occurred within 200 meters of
   the urban edge, caracals largely preyed on native species. Our findings
   have implications for understanding the ability of some species to
   persist in the face of rapid environmental change, human-wildlife
   conflict, pathogen transmission, and bioaccumulation of pesticides.
   Further, this approach could be incorporated into studies that estimate
   foraging-explicit resource selection and habitat preference.},

Title = {Ethnobotanical knowledge on indigenous fruits in Ohangwena and Oshikoto
   regions in Northern Namibia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Background: Indigenous communities in Namibia possess a rich indigenous
   knowledge expressed within many practices of these communities.
   Indigenous wild edible fruits are available along the Namibian 13
   regions of which it forms a rich source of vitamins, fibres, minerals
   and a heterogeneous collection of bioactive compounds referred to as
   phytochemicals for indigenous people's diet. The aim of this study was
   to record the different IKS practices on the indigenous fruit trees in
   Ohangwena and Oshikoto regions of Namibia.
   Methods: An ethnobotanical survey was undertaken to collect information
   from local communities from 23-29 October 2011. Data was collected
   through the use of questionnaires and personal interviews during field
   trips in the Ohangwena and Oshikoto regions. A total of 65 respondents
   were interviewed; 54\% women, 38\% men and 8\% both in group interviews.
   Results: The majority of the people interviewed were in their thirty's,
   with the youngest being 18 years old and the oldest being 98 years old.
   Forty three plant specimens were collected from the two regions; these
   specimens belong to 20 genera and 25 species. Regarding to the
   indigenous knowledge; 87\% of the respondents indicated that their
   knowledge on indigenous fruits was learnt mainly through their parent.
   Indigenous people's perception on declining indigenous fruits revealed
   that 56.3\% of the respondents reported that indigenous fruits were
   declining. Only a 42.2\% indicated that the indigenous fruits
   populations are increasing. Regarding to the management practices to
   improve the production of these indigenous fruit trees; 38.6\% reported
   that there are some efforts on management practices; on the other hand
   61.4\% reported there are no management practices on the indigenous
   fruit trees in their areas. Four species were found to be the most
   frequently used and mentioned fruits which need to be given high
   preference in terms of conservation are: Berchemia discolor, Hyphaene
   petersiana, Sclerocarya birrea and Diospyros mespiliformis. The
   following diseases and ailments have been reported to be treated by the
   indigenous fruit trees which include: toothache, diarrhoea, cough,
   tonsillitis, burns, skin allergy, stomach ache, snake bit, constipation,
   etc. 28\% of the respondents mentioned an ethno veterinary use(s) of
   these fruits, e. g. the use of the Ziziphus mucronata roots to treat
   diarrhoea in cattle, the bark of eembe (Berchemia discolor) to treat
   calf weakness.
   Conclusions: The local communities in Oshikoto and Ohangwena regions
   have relatively good knowledge and practices regarding the indigenous
   fruit. This study enhances our understanding on the indigenous fruit in
   Namibia and their uses by local communities.},

Abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems possess tangible and intangible economic benefits
   to human society that are still underestimated and not fully understood.
   This study aims: to determine 1) economic benefits and economic losses
   due to coral reef damage, 2) compensation values as replacement costs
   for damaged coral reefs as well as references to sustainable coral reef
   management. Based on the calculation, the TEV of coral reef ecosystems
   was estimated to be USD 11.96 billion or 2.82 million USD/ha. The
   economic losses due to coral reef destruction over the 20-year period
   from 1994 to 2014 were USD 1 billion or 50.18 million USD/yr. We
   anticipate that the economic loss of coral reefs will continue to rise
   due to the intensification of destructive fishing practices. Therefore,
   an effective management policy should be established to prevent further
   destruction of coral reefs in this area in the future. This study
   suggests that tangible procedures for compensation for coral damage and
   law enforcement for destroyers are required to be implemented to reduce
   the economic losses of coral reefs, and the economic values estimated in
   this study can be a quantitative reference for various stakeholders to
   build a concensus for designing coral reef recovery programs in the
   future.},

Abstract = {High levels of deer browsing can prevent canopy tree regeneration, but
   little is known about changes to forest size-structure following
   long-term deer herd reductions. We monitored changes in forest stand
   structure and composition in southwestern Ontario, Canada, over 28-years
   using permanent plots. Our study site was the largest remaining tract of
   Carolinian (deciduous) forest in Canada (11 km(2)), a habitat type that
   contains up to a fifth of Canada's species at risk and is under intense
   anthropogenic pressures. We recorded declines in all tree size classes
   between 1981 and 1996, during which densities of white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) reached a peak of 55 deer km(-2). Despite
   significant and sustained deer herd reductions between 1996 and 2009,
   which reduced deer densities to 7 deer km(-2), there was limited
   recruitment of small trees and declines in basal area of tree species
   that were sensitive to deer browsing. Our results suggest that recovery
   from herbivory is a protracted process during which canopy tree
   regeneration may continue to decline despite a reduction in browsing
   pressure due to deer culling. Large declines in canopy-tree densities in
   Carolinian forests may lead to forest size-structures and herbaceous
   plant communities that resemble rare oak savanna habitat, creating
   difficult decisions for conservation managers aiming to protect rare and
   endangered species within native ecosystems. We recommend that managers
   protect Carolinian forest stands and encourage canopy tree regeneration
   by increasing seed sources of native trees. While deer control is
   essential in reducing forest damage, our results highlight the need to
   explore other forms of active management to expedite otherwise slow
   increases in tree density. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   wet and dry seasons during 1977-2010. Species of different body sizes
   and feeding styles had different densities between landscapes and
   seasons. Small-sized herbivores, requiring short, nutritious grasses,
   and browsers were more abundant in the ranches than the reserve in both
   seasons. Medium-sized herbivores moved seasonally between landscapes.
   Larger-bodied herbivores, requiring bulk forage but less susceptible to
   predation, were more abundant in the reserve than the ranches. The
   proportions of newborn warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) and juvenile
   topi (Damaliscus korrigum) were higher in the ranches, with shorter
   grasses and lower predation risk than in the reserve. These results
   suggest that pastoral lands adjoining protected areas in African
   savannas are important as seasonal dispersal and breeding grounds for
   wild herbivores. However, human population growth and dramatic land use
   changes are progressively degrading wildlife habitats in pastoral areas,
   thus restricting the seasonal wildlife dispersal movements between the
   protected areas and adjoining pastoral lands. Conservation efforts
   should focus on (1) creating and maintaining functional heterogeneity in
   protected areas that mimic moderate pastoral grazing conditions to
   attract small and medium-bodied grazers and (2) securing dispersal
   areas, including corridors, to ensure continued seasonal large herbivore
   movements between protected and pastoral systems.},

Title = {Resting in risky environments: the importance of cover for wolves to
   cope with exposure risk in human-dominated landscapes},

Abstract = {Centuries of persecution have influenced the behaviour of large
   carnivores. For those populations persisting in human-dominated
   landscapes, complete spatial segregation from humans is not always
   possible, as they are in close contact with people even when they are
   resting. The selection of resting sites is expected to be critical for
   large carnivore persistence in human-dominated landscapes, where resting
   sites must offer protection to counteract exposure risk. Using wolves
   (Canis lupus) as a model species, we hypothesised that selection of
   resting sites by large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes will be
   not only influenced by human activities, but also strongly determined by
   cover providing concealment. We studied the fine-scale attributes of 546
   wolf resting sites and confronted them to 571 random points in NW
   Iberia. Half of resting sites (50.8 \%) were found in forests (mainly
   forest plantations, 73.1 \%), 43.4 \% in scrublands, and only 5.8 \% in
   croplands. Compared to random points, wolves located their resting sites
   far away from paved and large unpaved roads and from settlements,
   whereas they significantly selected areas with high availability of
   horizontal (refuge) and canopy cover. The importance of refuge was
   remarkably high, with its independent contribution alone being more
   important than the contribution of all the variables related to human
   pressure (distances) pooled (51.1 vs 42.8 \%, respectively). The
   strength of refuge selection allowed wolves even to rest relatively
   close to manmade structures, such as roads and settlements (sometimes
   less than 200 m). Maintaining high-quality refuge areas becomes an
   important element to favour the persistence of large carnivores in
   human-dominated landscapes as well as human-carnivore coexistence, which
   can easily be integrated in landscape planning.},

Title = {Dynamics of ungulates in relation to climatic and land use changes in an

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1033-1053},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Land use change and human population growth are accelerating the
   fragmentation and insularization of wildlife habitats worldwide. The
   conservation and management of wildlife in the resultant `island'
   ecosystems in the context of global warming is challenging due to the
   isolation and reduced size of the ecosystems and hence the scale over
   which ecosystem processes can operate. We analyzed trends in numbers of
   nine large herbivores in Kenya's Lake Nakuru National Park to understand
   how rainfall and temperature variability, surrounding land use changes,
   and boundary fencing affected wildlife population dynamics inside the
   park during 1970-2011. Buffalo, zebra and Thomson's gazelle numbers
   increased persistently. Grant's gazelle and impala increased initially
   then gradually declined. Waterbuck and warthog numbers progressively
   declined to levels that potentially threatened their local population
   persistence. The total biomass of ungulates tripled from 1970 to 2011,
   with buffalo replacing waterbuck as the predominant species in biomass.
   Increased competition from buffalo and zebra, heightened predation and
   illicit human harvests probably all contributed to the declines by
   waterbuck and warthog. Density-dependent limitation of population growth
   within the park confines was evident for buffalo, impala, eland,
   giraffe, Grant's and Thomson's gazelles. Fluctuations in the lake level
   related to varying rainfall affected changes in animal abundance through
   expansion of the lake area and flooding of grasslands bordering the
   lake. Unusually, the most stressful conditions were associated with high
   water levels following high rainfall. There was also evidence of
   carry-over effects from prior habitat conditions affecting all species.
   The relatively stable populations of all species except warthog and
   waterbuck demonstrate the remarkable capacity of this small, insularized
   park to retain viable populations of most of the large herbivores,
   without much management intervention.},

Title = {Changes in land use and management by farm type and the impact on soil
   cover in Canada, 1991?2011},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {116},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A suite of indicators have been developed in Canada to assess and report
   on the status and trends of agri-environmental performance as impacted
   by agricultural production activities. The indicators include models
   that focus on the impact of land management practices on soil erosion,
   water contamination, greenhouse gas emissions, soil organic carbon and
   wildlife habitat. Soil Cover is one of these indicators and relates to
   soil protection afforded by crop canopy, crop residue and snow. It is
   quantified by the equivalent number of days in a year in which the soil
   is not exposed, and is a function of the type of crop, biomass yield,
   tillage, residue management practices, and weather (snow) conditions.
   Higher soil cover indicates a lower risk of soil erosion, better
   maintenance of soil organic carbon, improved wildlife habitat and lower
   greenhouse gas emissions. The Soil Cover Indicator has been calculated
   and reported on a spatial basis over the entire country every five years
   since 1981. Currently, the agri-environmental indicators program is
   being re-oriented toward assessing the environmental sustainability of
   different production sectors (beef, hogs, dairy, grains, oilseeds, etc.)
   and commodities (milk, eggs, beef, pork, etc.) rather than
   geographic/areal units such as soil polygons or watersheds. As an
   initial effort in this direction, we have developed a farm types
   database on an ecostratification spatial framework, and have applied the
   Soil Cover Indicator to each farm type in order to assess its levels and
   changes pertaining to different farm types over the period from 1991 to
   2011. The database identified land use compositions and their
   spatio-temporal variability typical of different types of farms. Initial
   outputs indicate that Beef, Other Livestock and Other Crop farm types
   provide the highest soil cover, Dairy and Poultry/Egg farms provide
   moderate levels, and Field Crop, Hog and Fruit/Vegetable farms have the
   lowest levels. Temporal analysis indicates a general improvement in soil
   cover across most farm types from 1991 to 2011.},

Title = {Spatial analysis of aerial survey data reveals correlates of elephant
   carcasses within a heavily poached ecosystem},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {218},
Pages = {258-267},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Growth of the illegal wildlife trade is a key driver of biodiversity
   loss, with considerable research focussing on trafficking and trade, but
   rather less focussed on supply. Elephant poaching for ivory has driven a
   recent population decline in African elephants and is a typical example
   of illegal wildlife trade. Some of the heaviest poaching has been in
   Southern Tanzania's Ruaha-Rungwa ecosystem. Using data from three
   successive aerial surveys and modern spatial analysis techniques we
   identify the correlates of elephant carcasses within the ecosystem, from
   which important information about how poachers operate can be gleaned.
   Carcass density was highest close to wet-season (but not dry season)
   waterholes, at higher altitudes and at intermediate travel cost from
   villages. We found no evidence for an ecosystem-wide impact of ranger
   patrol locations on carcass abundance, but found strong evidence that
   different ranger posts showed contrasting patterns in relation to
   carcasses, some being significantly associated with clusters of
   carcasses, others showing the expected negative correlation and most
   showing no pattern at all. Despite a spatial change in elephant carcass
   locations between years, we find little evidence to suggest poachers
   have changed their behaviour in relation to key modelled covariates. Our
   maps of poaching activity can feed directly into anti-poaching control
   measures, but also provide general insights into how illegal harvest of
   high value wildlife products occurs in the field, and our spatiotemporal
   analysis provides a valuable analysis framework for aerial survey data
   from protected areas globally.},

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In peri-urban regions, the establishment of new forest patches can be
   affected by specific community assembly rules driving species extinction
   debts and colonization credits. This might result in species surpluses
   or deficits and shifts in species composition along forest
   establishment, whose association with human-driven landscape
   transformation remains largely unknown. We have compared plant
   assemblages in peri-urban Mediterranean forests of contrasting history
   (recent vs. preexisting; post- vs. pre-1956) according to species'
   habitat requirements (forest, scrub-grassland, synanthropic or other)
   and dispersal mode (vertebrate- vs. non-vertebrate), while considering
   site and landscape characteristics. Species richness and cover were
   mostly associated to site characteristics, but also to forest
   connectivity and history. Connectivity increased total species cover,
   forest species richness and both richness and cover of
   vertebrate-dispersed species, while reducing non-forest species richness
   and synanthropic species cover. Regarding forest history, recent stands
   showed higher total and non-forest species richness, higher
   scrub-grassland species cover and lower cover of vertebrate-dispersed
   species than preexisting forests. Thus, recent stands exhibit a species
   surplus due to the extinction debt of scrub-grassland species and the
   transient abundance of synanthropic species, despite the observed
   colonization credit of vertebrate-dispersed species. These results
   emphasize the importance of forest connectivity when managing plant
   species assemblage in peri-urban forest patches but also highlight the
   need to consider recent history of habitat patches to manage time lags
   in biodiversity change in human-transformed landscapes.},

Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflicts often spur retaliatory killing, which may be a
   major threat to some wildlife species. Asiatic black bears depredate
   crops and livestock and also attack humans. We investigated whether
   human-bear conflicts in Sichuan Province, southwestern China, resulted
   in increased bear poaching. We conducted semi-structured interviews
   within 429 15 x 15-km cells across the province, asking villagers about
   bear occurrence, population trends, attitudes toward bears, human-bear
   conflicts, responses to bear damage, and bear poaching. Bears raided
   crops (n = 174 cells), killed livestock (n = 114 cells), and attacked
   people (n = 49 cells). Fifty percent and 43\% of villagers held negative
   and neutral attitudes toward bears, respectively; attitudes were more
   negative among people who had previous interactions with bears or lived
   where bear encounters were more likely. Although killing bears was
   illegal, villagers in 117 cells (38\%) indicated that bear poaching
   occurred around their villages. However, killing bears was not
   significantly linked to damage: indeed, killing was more common in areas
   without human-bear conflicts. Poachers killed bears mainly for trade of
   their valuable parts (gall bladder and paws, 78.5\%). Tibetan people
   experienced bear damage and also had negative attitudes toward bears,
   but reported less poaching than Han or Yi people, due to their religious
   beliefs. Our study indicated that human-wildlife conflicts shaped
   people's attitudes toward bears, but strong economic incentives, not
   attitudes, prompted illegal killing. Whereas mitigation of human-bear
   conflicts could help foster more positive attitudes toward bears and the
   nature reserves that protect bears, this strategy will not remove the
   primary threat against this species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Size, shape and maintenance matter: A critical appraisal of a global
   carnivore conflict mitigation strategy - Livestock protection kraals in
   northern Botswana},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {225},
Pages = {88-97},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fortified kraals are predator-proof enclosures designed to protect
   livestock at night. Globally, they show great promise in reducing
   depredation by carnivores, thus promoting co-existence with people.
   Their efficacy depends on effectiveness, durability, regular use, owner
   satisfaction, cost-efficiency, and design. We monitored 32 fortified
   kraals for 18 months in a high conflict area in northern Botswana (n =
   427 kraal months) where lions (Panthera leo) frequently kill cattle.
   Monthly kraal use was 60\% and was significantly influenced by kraal
   type, age, and shape. When used and maintained, kraals stopped livestock
   depredation. Due to poor maintenance, however, kraal age had a
   significant, negative influence on kraal use and effectiveness,
   compromising sustainability and cost-effectiveness. Fortified kraals
   built by a non-governmental organisation cost US\$1322.36 per unit (n =
   20) and mitigated a mean annual loss of \$187.32. This suggests
   cost-recuperation after 7.0 years, or 2.3 times longer than observed
   kraal lifetime. Conversely, owner-built replicates cost \$579.90 per
   unit (n = 4), recuperating investment after 3.1 years. Owner
   satisfaction was significantly higher for fortified kraals when compared
   with traditional kraals. However, owners of fortified kraals did not
   kraal their cattle more frequently than owners of traditional kraals.
   Regionally, the mean annual kraaling rate for 29 GPS-monitored cattle
   herds (n = 3360 nights) was 40\%, leaving cattle vulnerable to
   depredation, and highlighting the importance of promoting vigilant
   herding together with kraaling to prevent losses. This combination could
   reduce regional livestock losses by 80\%, or > \$38,000 annually,
   however, kraal fortification alone does not provide a blanket solution
   to carnivore conflicts in Africa's agro-pastoral landscapes.},

Title = {Predicting potential habitat and population size for reintroduction of
   the Far Eastern leopards in the Russian Far East},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {144},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2403-2413},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Far Eastern Leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis; Schlegel, 1857) is
   perhaps the world's most endangered large felid subspecies occurring in
   a single population of,30 adults, and faces immediate risk of extinction
   unless additional populations can be established within its historical
   range in the Russian Far East. We used locations of leopard tracks (and
   their ungulate prey) collected from snow track surveys from 1997 to 2007
   to develop resource selection functions (RSF) to identify potential
   habitat for reintroduction. We compared models that include prey versus
   those based on landscape covariates. and also included covariates
   related to human-induced mortality. To estimate potential population
   size, we used a habitat-based population estimate based on the ratio of
   population size and RSF value of occupied range. Far Eastern leopards
   selected for areas with high ungulate density, lower-elevation Korean
   pine forests on southwest facing slopes, and in areas far from human
   activity. Using this RSF model, we identified a total of 10,648 km(2) in
   eight patches > 500 km(2) of potential Far Eastern leopard habitat that
   could harbor a potential population of 105.3 (57.9-147.2) adults. In
   combination with the existing population, successful reintroductions
   could result in a total of 139.2 (76.5-194.6) adult leopards, a 3-4-fold
   increase in population size. Our habitat models assist the
   reintroduction planning process by identifying factors that predict
   presence and potential suitable habitat. Identifying the highest
   quality, most connected patches, in combination with appropriate
   selection and training of released animals, is recommended for
   successfully reintroducing Far Eastern leopards, and potentially other
   endangered carnivores into the wild. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Do bats seek clean water? A perspective on biodiversity from the Namib
   Desert},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {248},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Water abundance, distribution, and quality are key elements affecting
   species distributions in arid environments, yet how their interactions
   structure specific animal communities is often unclear. To address this
   knowledge gap, we examined relationships between bodies of water and bat
   communities in the northern Namib Desert. We predicted that water
   quality would be poorer (i.e., higher indices of electrical conductivity
   and ion concentrations) during the dry season and a artificial pools,
   and that bat species richness and activity would consequently be lower a
   these sites. We conducted extensive fieldwork a the terminus of the hot,
   dry season from November 2016 to January 2017 and a the conclusion of
   the following we season from March to May 2017, collecting water samples
   and acoustic recordings of bat activity a both natural springs (n = 18)
   and artificial pools (n = 5). Overall activity (but not species
   richness) was greater during the we season and at artificial pools, but
   we did not find systematic differences in water quality driven by
   seasonality or water body type. Although individual artificial pools
   harbored significantly greater bat activity, > 35\% of the species that
   we recorded were present only at natural springs. While bat species
   richness was reduced at saline sites, only the activity of the Zulu
   serotine also related to water quality. In general, water surface area
   was more often associated with bat activity in the Namib Desert than was
   water quality.},

Abstract = {Planet Earth is entering the age of megafire, pushing ecosystems to
   their limits and beyond. While fire causes mortality of animals across
   vast portions of the globe, scientists are only beginning to consider
   fire as an evolutionary force in animal ecology. Here, we generate a
   series of hypotheses regarding animal responses to fire by adopting
   insights from the predator-prey literature. Fire is a lethal threat;
   thus, there is likely strong selection for animals to recognize the
   olfactory, auditory, and visual cues of fire, and deploy fire avoidance
   behaviours that maximize survival probability. If fire defences are
   costly, it follows that intraspecific variation in fire avoidance
   behaviours should correspond with variation in fire behaviour and
   regimes. Species and populations inhabiting ecosystems that rarely
   experience fire may lack these traits, placing `fire naive' populations
   and species at enhanced extinction risk as the distribution of fire
   extends into new ecosystem types. We outline a research agenda to
   understand behavioural responses to fire and to identify conservation
   interventions that could be used to overcome fire naivety.},

Abstract = {Most of Earth's terrestrial carbon is stored in the soil and can be
   released as carbon dioxide (CO2) when disturbed. Although humans are
   known to exacerbate soil CO2 emissions through land-use change, we know
   little about the global carbon footprint of invasive species. We predict
   the soil area disturbed and resulting CO2 emissions from wild pigs (Sus
   scrofa), a pervasive human-spread vertebrate that uproots soil. We do
   this using models of wild pig population density, soil damage, and their
   effect on soil carbon emissions. Our models suggest that wild pigs are
   uprooting a median area of 36,214 km(2) (mean of 123,517 km(2)) in their
   non-native range, with a 95\% prediction interval (PI) of 14,208
   km(2)-634,238 km(2). This soil disturbance results in median emissions
   of 4.9 million metric tonnes (MMT) CO2 per year (equivalent to 1.1
   million passenger vehicles or 0.4\% of annual emissions from land use,
   land-use change, and forestry; mean of 16.7 MMT) but that it is highly
   uncertain (95\% PI, 0.3-94 MMT CO2) due to variability in wild pig
   density and soil dynamics. This uncertainty points to an urgent need for
   more research on the contribution of wild pigs to soil damage, not only
   for the reduction of anthropogenically related carbon emissions, but
   also for co-benefits to biodiversity and food security that are crucial
   for sustainable development.},

Title = {Tracking a half century of media reporting on gray wolves},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {645-654},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Natural resource and wildlife managers must balance the disparate
   priorities of a diversity of stakeholders. To manage these priorities, a
   firm understanding of topics salient to the public is needed. The media
   often report on issues of importance to the public; therefore, these
   reports may be a useful measure of public interest. However, efficient
   methods for distinguishing diverse topics related to a wildlife
   management issue reported in the media and changes in the salience of
   those topics have been lacking. We used latent Dirichlet allocation, a
   Bayesian mixture model, to quantitatively assess the salience of topics
   surrounding the gray wolf (Canis lupus), which was reintroduced to Idaho
   (U.S.A.) in 1995. We analyzed articles published from 1960 to 2015 in an
   Idaho newspaper. We identified 6 distinct topics associated with gray
   wolves: policy, hunting, biological status, implementation of
   management, recovery, and human-wolf conflict. The salience of topics
   pre- and postreintroduction of wolves (1995) and pre- and postdelisting
   of wolves from the U.S. Endangered Species Act (2009) differed
   significantly, underscoring that these events were turning points in how
   issues were being publicly discussed and framed. Articles written by the
   local reporters were more likely to report on topics regarding conflict
   between humans and wolves, whereas articles sourced from a national
   outlet reported more on topics pertaining to wolf policy and biological
   status. In the context of managing a contentious, far-ranging, and
   long-lived wildlife species, our methods can help guide the location and
   timing of a suite of management strategies (e.g., media relation plans
   and stakeholder engagement) that promote human-wildlife coexistence
   across different landscapes.},

Title = {Changes and interactions between forest landscape connectivity and burnt

Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The spatial structure, functionality and dynamics of forest landscapes
   in peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands were compared over the last
   five decades. Two particular features were studied in the sample sites:
   forest connectivity for wildlife and areas burnt by wildfires. 191
   Squares, each 4km x 4 km, were selected from the SISPARES (the
   monitoring framework designed to evaluate the trends in the structure of
   Spanish rural landscapes) environmental strata. Aerial photographs from
   1956, 1984, 1998 and 2008 were interpreted and 11 land cover categories
   mapped and checked in the field, using a minimum mapping area of one
   hectare. The Equivalent Connected Area Index was used to assess forest
   connectivity over the sampling period. Social and economical factors
   were assessed using indicators of farm intensiveness. The Spanish forest
   connectivity has improved in the last five decades although two
   different trends can be identified: the first 40 years are characterized
   by positive rates of growth whereas the 10 last years are characterized
   by their stability. Nevertheless the area of burnt land was higher along
   the first 25 studied years and decreased significantly over the last
   decade.
   Our results show the climate is the main driver in the evolution of
   forest connectivity and burnt area in the forest landscapes, playing a
   direct role on forest biomass production and wildfire ignition and
   propagation, as well as an indirect role by keeping vertical and
   horizontal forest continuity through the landscape spatial pattern.
   Social and economic factors are very important drivers as well: Rural
   population density and farm size average have been tested as good
   indicators of landscape artificiality, highly correlated to wildfire
   hazard and forest connectivity.
   Finally, we have pointed out the evolutionary path followed by SISPARES
   framework as a tool for monitoring rural landscapes. It emphasises on
   the requirement of a 30 years time window for building-up reliable
   dynamic multifunctional model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Wildlife inhabiting human-dominated landscapes is at risk of pathogen
   spill-over from domestic species. With the aim of gaining knowledge in
   the dynamics of viral infections in Iberian wolves (Canis lupus) living
   in anthropized landscapes of northern Spain, we analysed between 2010
   and 2013 the samples of 54 wolves by serology and polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) for exposure to four pathogenic canine viruses: canine
   distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus-2 (CPV), canine adenovirus 1
   and 2 (CAV-1 and CAV-2) and canine herpesvirus. Overall, 76\% of the
   studied wolves presented evidence of exposure to CPV (96\% by HI, 66\%
   by PCR) and 75\% to CAV (75\% by virus neutralization (VN), 76\% by PCR,
   of which 70\% CAV-1 and 6\% CAV-2). This represents the first detection
   of CAV-2 infection in a wild carnivore. CPV/CAV-1 co-infection occurred
   in 51\% of the wolves. The probability of wolf exposure to CPV was
   positively and significantly correlated with farm density in a buffer
   zone around the place where the wolf was found, indicating that rural
   dogs might be the origin of CPV infecting wolves. CPV and CAV-1 appear
   to be enzootic in the Iberian wolf population, which is supported by the
   absence of seasonal and inter-annual variations in the proportion of
   positive samples detected. However, while CPV may depend on periodical
   introductions by dogs, CAV-1 may be maintained within the wolf
   population. All wolves were negative for exposure to CDV (by VN and PCR)
   and CHV (by PCR). The absence of acquired immunity against CDV in this
   population may predispose it to an elevated rate of mortality in the
   event of a distemper spill-over via dogs.},

Title = {Wolf depredation hotspots in France: Clustering analyses adjusting for
   livestock availability},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {267},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Areas exhibiting high levels of predations on livestock generate
   conflicts between humans and large carnivores. Managers generally seek
   to identify these hotspots, in order to diagnose the causes that lead to
   hotspot forma-tions and to provide financial or technical support to the
   involved livestock owners. When locating depredation hotspots, previous
   studies have not adjusted for livestock availability, making it
   difficult for managers to discriminate hotspots resulting from
   underlying livestock clusters from those due to other factors such as
   environmental factors. We studied hotspots of wolf depredation on sheep
   in France from the beginning of the natural wolf recolonisation in 1994
   up to 2018. For each year, we applied the Ripley's K-function and
   Ripley's K-inhom to determine the general depredation spatial pattern
   and the Kulldorff statistic to locate depredation hotspots. We showed
   that omitting livestock availability in these analyses led to flawed
   inference about the depredation pattern, and resulted in a substantial
   number of unidentified hotspots, including pastoral surfaces with low
   sheep availability. Our methodology provides reliable information for
   managers to understand the depredation pattern over space and time and
   to allocate resources.},

Abstract = {Contemporary climate change has complex effects on animal populations
   caused by the (non-linear) combination of multiple direct and indirect
   effects on individuals. These interactions make predictions of the
   ecological response to climate change challenging; however, predictive
   models are required to effectively manage wildlife populations and
   conserve biodiversity. Here, we demonstrate how agent-based models
   (ABMs) can be used to predict population responses under multiple
   effects of climate change. We consider the case of northern common
   eiders (Somateria mollissima borealis), a culturally and ecologically
   important seaduck which is experiencing dramatic environmental change
   due to losses in Arctic sea ice. Our model shows that losses in Arctic
   sea ice will lead to increases in nest predation by polar bears in areas
   where these species are sympatric. However, climate mediated increases
   in breeding propensity and clutch size could have a large positive
   effect on eider population size. When considered together, these effects
   are predicted to result in a relatively stable eider population size
   over a 50-year period. Additionally, assuming eider populations are
   influenced by climate change in the manner proposed in this study, our
   model suggests that future eider populations will not be more
   susceptible to extrinsic perturbations (e.g. severe weather events,
   disease outbreaks) than were historical populations. As a result, our
   study demonstrates increasing climatic suitability and increasing nest
   predation will not lead to major changes in population size in northern
   common eiders, and emphasizes the importance of considering multiple,
   interacting effects on wildlife populations experiencing climate change.},

Abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are considered a major threat to
   global health. Most EIDs appear to result from increased contact between
   wildlife and humans, especially when humans encroach into formerly
   pristine habitats. Habitat deterioration may also negatively affect the
   physiology and health of wildlife species, which may eventually lead to
   a higher susceptibility to infectious agents and/or increased shedding
   of the pathogens causing EIDs. Bats are known to host viruses closely
   related to important EIDs. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest
   with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance
   influences the occurrence of astro- and coronaviruses in eight bat
   species. In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat
   disturbance was not associated with corona- and astrovirus detection
   rates in fecal samples. However, we found that bats infected with either
   astro- or coronaviruses were likely to be coinfected with the respective
   other virus. Additionally, we identified two more risk factors
   influencing astrovirus shedding. First, the detection rate of
   astroviruses was higher at the beginning of the rainy compared to the
   dry season. Second, there was a trend that individuals with a poor body
   condition had a higher probability of shedding astroviruses in their
   feces. The identification of risk factors for increased viral shedding
   that may potentially result in increased interspecies transmission is
   important to prevent viral spillovers from bats to other animals,
   including humans.},

Abstract = {Illegal wildlife trade represents a major threat to biodiversity. Recent
   wildlife consumption trends across Asia have shown shifts in preference
   towards new species, such as Sunda pangolin, and increased volumes of
   consumption for longer-traded species, such as tiger. These trends are
   widely thought to be a result of the higher levels of wealth generated
   from the impressive economic growth experienced across Asia. This raises
   important questions regarding the role that economic growth plays as a
   driver of poaching on source populations of highly prized species. As a
   first step to answering these, we investigate trade dynamics related to
   the poaching of tigers and their principal prey using a long-term
   biological and economic data set. The fluctuating poaching patterns
   recorded for tiger prey, which are locally consumed for their meat,
   showed no association with rising domestic beef prices, the most likely
   substitutable protein source. However for tiger, annual poaching rates
   were positively and significantly correlated with changes in local tiger
   skin prices that, in turn, were closely correlated with annual GDP
   changes in the key consumer countries. Our preliminary analysis raises
   further questions around the causal pathways through which rising
   affluence and extinction risk are linked; a question that should be
   posed for a wide set of species. Thus, the strong regional leadership
   that has enabled high economic growth across Asia and lifted hundreds of
   millions of people out of poverty should now be urgently directed to
   tackling illegal wildlife trade and, as a priority, to closing domestic
   and international trafficking routes.},

Abstract = {Background The consumption of bear gallbladders and bear bile in
   Southeast Asia is a persistent threat to bear populations. As part of a
   larger effort to understand the characteristics of bear part consumption
   in Cambodia, we uncovered a consumer base of women seeking treatment for
   post-partum and uterine ailments. Methods To better understand this
   aspect of consumption, we interviewed 122 women in seven different
   provinces in Cambodia, probing into the motivations and influences for
   using bear bile, as well as what types of ailments Cambodian women use
   it for. Results We found that it is generally used by young or expecting
   mothers, and for such issues as post-partum ``fatigue{''} (toas in
   Khmer), which could encompass post-partum depression. A desire to be
   supported by kin networks seems to facilitate the continued use of bear
   gallbladder and bile for these purposes. Conclusions We suggest that
   efforts to reduce consumption should focus on encouraging older kin to
   change their means of support to Western/biomedical and by extension
   non-wildlife alternatives.},

Abstract = {Respiratory illness (RI) accounts for a large proportion of mortalities
   in mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), and fatal outbreaks,
   including disease caused by human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infections,
   have heightened concern about the risk of human pathogen transmission to
   this endangered species, which is not only critically important to the
   biodiversity of its ecosystem but also to the economies of the
   surrounding human communities. Our goal was to conduct a molecular
   epidemiologic study to detect the presence of HRSV and HMPV in fecal
   samples from wild human-habituated free-ranging mountain gorillas in
   Rwanda and to evaluate the role of these viruses in RI outbreaks. Fecal
   samples were collected from gorillas with clinical signs of RI between
   June 2012 and February 2013 and tested by real-time and conventional
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays; comparison fecal samples were
   obtained from gorillas without clinical signs of RI sampled during the
   2010 Virunga gorilla population census. PCR assays detected HMPV and
   HRSV first in spiked samples; subsequently, HRSV-A, the
   worldwide-circulating ON1 genotype, was detected in 12 of 20 mountain
   gorilla fecal samples collected from gorillas with RI during outbreaks,
   but not in samples from animals without respiratory illness. Our
   findings confirmed that pathogenic human respiratory viruses are
   transmitted to gorillas and that they are repeatedly introduced into
   mountain gorilla populations from people, attesting to the need for
   stringent biosecurity measures for the protection of gorilla health.},

Abstract = {The persistence of the coat color polymorphism melanism has been
   reported for several tropical felids, but its evolutionary advantages
   remain an active area of research. Few publications have explored
   melanism in the elusive species, oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus) within the
   Neotropical part of their range in Costa Rica. Herein, I present the
   first record of a melanistic oncilla within the montane cloud forest of
   Monteverde, Costa Rica. Recent studies have found support for theories
   (e.g. Temporal Segregation Hypothesis and Gloger's Rule) explaining the
   ecological advantages driving melanism in oncilla and tropical felid
   populations. However, it is unclear what is driving melanism in this
   Monteverde oncilla population due to the singular observation. Further
   research investigating whether melanism is occurring at a higher
   frequency in other individuals in the region is critical to better
   understanding the occurrence of melanism in local populations of this
   cryptic species. The montane cloud forest in Monteverde provides
   critical habitat to this vulnerable species within the small Neotropical
   part of their range. Melanistic individuals may be particularly
   threatened by land-use change and increasing human pressure if theories
   for the evolutionary advantages and ecological conditions motivating
   melanism are supported.},

Title = {Spatial distribution of wild boar population abundance: Basic
   information for spatial epidemiology and wildlife management},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {594-600},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrota) is growing in numbers and has been
   expanding its distribution in Europe from some decades ago. This
   increasing trend, in some circumstances, leads to conflicts involving
   several sectors, among others, agriculture damages, conservation
   problems and health risks. The disease-related conflicts are especially
   relevant; wild boar was raised as a potential host for numerous
   pathogens provoking economic losses to the livestock industry. In a
   wildlife management context, reliable indicators of wild boar abundance
   at large spatial scales are highly demanded. Thus, our main aim was to
   handle hunting bag data available for the 2006-2007 to 2009-2010 hunting
   seasons in order to develop a predictive model able to account for wild
   boar abundance in overall mainland Spain. For modelling, the response
   variable was the number of wild boars annually hunted per 100 km(2) in
   each hunting estate, as a well-established wild boar abundance index.
   Using data for 6280 hunting estates (similar to 44\% of the study area),
   and 21 ecogeographical predictors (geography, climate and land cover),
   we modelled the species abundance by means of generalized linear models
   with a negative binomial distribution. Three analytical approaches were
   comparatively assessed, which differed in how the five bioregions
   considered in the Spanish Wildlife Disease Surveillance Scheme were
   considered in modelling. In terms of predictive performance on
   independent datasets, the approach in which five independent models were
   adjusted (one per bioregion) achieved the highest scores. These models
   were used to predict wild boar abundance in overall mainland Spain by
   using UTM 10 x 10 km squares (n=5245) and municipalities (n = 8050) as
   territorial units, in order to enhance the representativeness of the
   model at national scale and their usefulness in epidemiological studies,
   respectively. The pattern for wild boar abundance obtained in this study
   enlarges the knowledge of this species in mainland Spain. The analytical
   procedure developed here is valuable in itself, and it can be considered
   to model the spatial patterns of wild boar - or other relevant species -
   elsewhere, which is information highly demanded for wildlife managers in
   general and epidemiologists in particular. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Temperate grasslands have suffered from severe habitat loss and
   degradation worldwide. In Russia, vast areas of forest-steppe grasslands
   have been converted to cropland during Soviet times, whilst remaining
   grasslands were often intensively grazed. Contrastingly, the collapse of
   the Soviet Union have resulted in a massive reduction in livestock
   numbers and cessation of management. Albeit relatively large natural
   grassland areas remained in the Western Siberian Plain, their present
   condition is poorly studied. We analysed plant species composition,
   functional structure and richness of grassland communities and tested
   for the effect of local factors (management, abiotic site conditions)
   and landscape factors (patch size, proportion of land cover types) on
   diversity patterns. Abiotic site conditions, mainly soil moisture and
   salinity, differentiated distinct community types. Overall, species
   richness was highest in meadow steppe communities with lower soil
   moisture and salinity. Grazing intensity and litter accumulation due to
   cessation of management were significant negative related to species
   richness and shaped the functional structure. At the landscape scale,
   diversity in meadow steppe grasslands was higher in forest-grassland
   mosaics and in small remnants isolated in a matrix of cropland. Our
   findings highlight that meadow steppes suffered massively under the
   historical habitat loss and high grazing pressure. Small species-rich
   remnants are evidence of the former extent of meadow steppe habitats in
   agricultural landscape, but are likely threatened by an extinction debt.
   Low intense, irregular mowing maintained species-rich meadow steppe in
   forest- grassland mosaics, but currently such practices are declining.},

Title = {Effects of planting method and seed mix richness on the early stages of

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {144},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3127-3139},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tallgrass prairie restoration has been practiced for more than 75 years,
   yet few studies have systematically tested restoration methods over
   large geographic regions with the intent of refining methodology. In
   this study, we used three planting methods (dormant-season broadcast,
   growing-season broadcast and growing-season drill) fully crossed with
   three levels of seed species richness (10, 20, and 34 spp). We
   replicated the study on nine former agricultural fields located from
   east-central Iowa (Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge) to northwestern
   Minnesota (Litchfield, Fergus Falls and Morris Wetland Management
   Districts), USA, within the northern tallgrass prairie biome. Objectives
   were to evaluate the relative influences of planting method, seed mix
   richness, and their interactions, on (1) planted cover (both total and
   by guild) and richness, (2) exotic species cover, and (3) non-planted
   native species cover. Optimal techniques varied between the two study
   areas: the dormant broadcast method produced greater cover of planted
   species at the Minnesota sites and the growing-season drill method
   produced greater cover of planted species at Iowa sites. The dormant
   broadcast method strongly favored establishment of perennial forbs while
   the growing-season drill favored warm-season grasses. Although
   increasing richness of the seed mix produced greater planted species
   richness, this did not result in greater resistance to exotic invasion.
   We conclude that, if planting during the growing season, drilling seed
   is preferable to broadcasting, but if the choice is between broadcasting
   seed in the dormant or growing season, the dormant season is preferred.

Title = {Impacts of alien grass invasion in coastal seed banks vary amongst
   native growth forms and dispersal strategies},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {171},
Pages = {114-126},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Alien plant invaders frequently reduce biodiversity of native
   communities, but the mechanisms of impact remain poorly understood. We
   used the seedling emergence method to assess impacts of invasion by an
   alien, clonal grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum) on endangered coastal
   swamp forest seed banks of eastern Australia. We asked: do impacts vary
   amongst native plant growth forms and dispersal strategies, and are
   impacts driven by propagule or recruitment limitation? Invasion was
   associated with significant reductions in seed bank species richness and
   increased dissimilarity between the seed bank and standing vegetation.
   The rate of species loss was more than two times greater within the
   standing vegetation than seed bank, however, indicating that the primary
   mechanism of community change is limited recruitment from the seed bank
   rather than a reduction in the arrival and storage of propagules to
   invaded sites. Overall, species losses were observed for herbs,
   graminoids and vertebrate-dispersed species, whilst wind and water
   dispersed and woody species were unaffected by invasion. Overall, seed
   banks were substantially richer than the standing vegetation across both
   invaded and non-invaded sites, indicating a high potential for
   unassisted reestablishment of a species-rich standing vegetation from
   the seed bank following S. secundatum removal, although one unlikely to
   resemble the original community in structure, function and identity of
   species. Differential impacts across functional groups may result in
   regenerating communities relatively dominated by woody species, which
   may prevent subsequent recolonisation by herbs and graminoids.
   Monitoring will be required to identify whether these and other species
   require assisted reintroduction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Insects perform many ecosystem functions, yet their responses to
   disturbance can be unpredictable. Changes in climate may interact with
   land use disturbances, and given that arthropod species diversity,
   abundance, and traits within assemblages vary with habitat structure and
   climatic variables, ecological function may be impaired. Here, we
   assessed how dung beetle species richness, abundance, functional
   diversity, mean body size and body size inequality (which can signal
   assemblage stress responses) varied with climatic, management and
   habitat variables on livestock farms and protected areas across a
   rainfall gradient (138-381 mm/year) in arid/semi-arid shrubland (Karoo,
   South Africa, an area for which entomological biodiversity is relatively
   poorly known), during a prolonged drought. Species richness was similar
   between farms and protected areas, but abundance was greater in
   protected areas. Farms tend to be dominated by sheep in this region, and
   the type of dung and paucity of dung diversity, along with use of
   anthelmintics may explain this reduced abundance. Species richness and
   abundance increased with mammalian herbivore stocking rates and
   rainfall. Most recent rainfall best predicted species richness, but
   abundance was best explained by the long-term measure of rainfall (Mean
   Annual Precipitation). Functional diversity showed no patterns with the
   environmental or management variables we measured. Mean body length and
   size variation did not differ between protected areas and farms, but the
   spread of beetle sizes was more even as vegetation cover increased and
   soil clay content decreased. Future climate projections indicate extreme
   declines in rainfall in this area, and our results suggest that this
   would dramatically impact dung beetle communities. Maintaining
   vegetation cover may help mitigate effects of climate change.},

Abstract = {Sea urchins of the genus Diadema, key herbivores in coral reef
   ecosystems, also provide habitat for other organisms. Our research
   extended Diadema biogeography in seaways east and west of Sulawesi and
   identified Diadema species associated with the endemic Banggai
   cardinalfish (Pterapogon kauderni) using field surveys and molecular DNA
   barcoding methods. Field observations (20 sites, n = 11,223) found
   urchins with morphological phenotypes typical of Diadema setosum
   (approximate to 74\%, all sites), D. savignyi (approximate to 24\%, 19
   sites) and atypical or mixed traits (approximate to 2\%, 19 sites).
   Distribution of these phenotype groups across the three main habitat
   types (i.e. coral reef, reef flat and seagrass beds) differed
   significantly (chi(2) = 533.03, p < 2.2e(-16)), indicating overlapping
   but non-equivalent ecological niches. Pterapogon kauderni associated
   with all urchin morphological phenotypes present. Diadema mtDNA CO1
   sequences were obtained from tissue samples collected (4 sites, n = 62)
   from specimens with typical D. savignyi and D. setosum phenotypes.
   Phylogenetic tree analysis resolved the sequences into four clades.
   Three clades from our analysis were identified as D. savignyi, D.
   setosum and D. clarki based on additional sequences obtained from
   GenBank. This unexpected first record of D. clarki mtDNA in the Coral
   Triangle implies a substantial extension of the known range of this
   recently resurrected species. Our findings indicate the occurrence
   and/or introgression of D. clarki may be widespread, and
   misidentification of Diadema urchins based on external morphology may be
   relatively common. Further research is required to determine the
   distribution and functional roles of Indo-Pacific Diadema species,
   contributing to our understanding of processes underpinning
   biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Forecasting impacts of future climate change is an important challenge
   to biologists, both for understanding the consequences of different
   emissions trajectories and for developing adaptation measures that will
   minimize biodiversity loss. Existing variation provides a window into
   the effects of climate on species and ecosystems, but in many places
   does not encompass the levels or timeframes of forcing expected under
   directional climatic change. Experiments help us to fill in these
   uncertainties, simulating directional shifts to examine outcomes of new
   levels and sustained changes in conditions. Here, we explore the
   translation between short-term responses to climate variability and
   longer-term trajectories that emerge under directional climatic change.
   In a decade-long experiment, we compare effects of short-term and
   long-term forcings across three trophic levels in grassland plots
   subjected to natural and experimental variation in precipitation. For
   some biological responses (plant productivity), responses to long-term
   extension of the rainy season were consistent with short-term responses,
   while for others (plant species richness, abundance of invertebrate
   herbivores and predators), there was pronounced divergence of long-term
   trajectories from short-term responses. These differences between
   biological responses mean that sustained directional changes in climate
   can restructure ecological relationships characterizing a system.
   Importantly, a positive relationship between plant diversity and
   productivity turned negative under one scenario of climate change, with
   a similar change in the relationship between plant productivity and
   consumer biomass. Inferences from experiments such as this form an
   important part of wider efforts to understand the complexities of
   climate change responses.},

Title = {Patterns of herbivory and fluctuating asymmetry in Solanum lycocarpum
   St. Hill (Solanaceae) along an urban gradient in Brazil},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {557-561},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The urbanization of the natural landscape has spread along the major
   axis of all large towns worldwide, what has resulted in an unprecedented
   increase in habitat fragmentation and ultimately in a mosaic of patches
   of native vegetation. These changes have a continuum of impacts on the
   processes and mechanisms that shape habitat diversity and species
   interactions. An important and overlooked aspect that may aid in the
   understanding of the effects of urbanization on species interactions is
   herbivory. Herbivores and leaf removal can signalize the effects of the
   habitat via their host plants. Another potentially useful measure for
   evaluating the effects of environmental stress on particular species is
   fluctuating asymmetry. We studied the herbivory levels and leaf
   fluctuating asymmetry on Solanum lycocarpum (Solanaceae) along an urban
   gradient in Brazil. The leaf area removed by folivores differed among
   sites and was significantly greater in the site with the higher level of
   urbanization. Also, the area removed varied significantly among
   individuals within urbanization sites. Similarly, the frequency of
   leaves with folivore damage was greater in the site with higher
   urbanization, although the area removed by them did not differ between
   shorter and larger plants. FA was significantly greater in the more
   urbanized sites in comparison with the other sites in the urbanization
   gradient and varied among individuals within site. Finally, we found a
   positive relationship between leaf area removed and FA values in the
   urbanization gradient. These results indicate that increased
   urbanization causes a reduction in habitat suitability for S.
   lycocarpum, which is reflected on higher FA levels. The leaf herbivores
   may benefit from the stress levels of hosts on more urbanized sites,
   which may have been caused by several factors acting in combination such
   as lower defenses, higher susceptibility and natural enemy pressures via
   habitat fragmentation/urbanization. This study exemplifies the variety
   of effects that urbanization exerts on remnant native populations and
   that fluctuating asymmetry could be a useful measure of the effects of
   these challenges on plant populations. and might also be used to assist
   management and conservation practices of natural areas within cities.

Title = {Integrating physiological stress into the movement ecology of migratory
   ungulates: a spatial analysis with mule deer},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Rapid climate and human land-use change may limit the ability of
   long-distance migratory herbivores to optimally track or `surf'
   high-quality forage during spring green-up. Understanding how
   anthropogenic and environmental stressors influence migratory movements
   is of critical importance because of their potential to cause a mismatch
   between the timing of animal movements and the emergence of high-quality
   forage. We measured stress hormones (fecal glucocorticoid metabolites;
   FGMs) to test hypotheses about the effects of high-quality forage
   tracking, human land-use and use of stopover sites on the physiological
   state of individuals along a migratory route. We collected and analysed
   FGM concentrations from 399 mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) samples
   obtained along a 241-km migratory route in western Wyoming, USA, during
   spring 2015 and 2016. In support of a fitness benefit hypothesis,
   individuals occupying areas closer to peak forage quality had decreased
   FGM levels. Specifically, for every 10-day interval closer to peak
   forage quality, we observed a 7\% decrease in FGMs. Additionally, we
   observed support for both an additive anthropogenic stress hypothesis
   and a hypothesis that stopovers act as physiological refugia, wherein
   individuals sampled far from stopover sites exhibited 341\% higher FGM
   levels if in areas of low landscape integrity compared to areas of high
   landscape integrity. Overall, our findings indicate that the
   physiological state of mule deer during migration is influenced by both
   anthropogenic disturbances and their ability to track high-quality
   forage. The availability of stopovers, however, modulates physiological
   responses to those stressors. Thus, our results support a recent call
   for the prioritization of stopover locations and connectivity between
   those locations in conservation planning for migratory large herbivores.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In September 2003, Hurricane Isabel created an inlet over 500 m wide and
   10 m deep that connected the Atlantic Ocean and Pamlico Sound. This
   breach was subsequently filled with sediments dredged from the adjacent
   sound. The purpose of this study was to determine if the barrier island
   terrestrial plant communities were naturally re-establishing through
   primary succession. In 2006-2008, we compared plant communities, soil
   carbon and nitrogen, and Aeolian transport of sediments in undisturbed
   back-dunes, undisturbed shrub thickets, putative back-dunes, and
   putative shrub thickets. We found that species richness and evenness
   were low on the filled area relative to adjacent plant communities that
   had persisted through the storm. Plants on the filled area were almost
   entirely limited to a band of primarily Spartina patens found at the
   margin of the sound and there were no signs of establishing the typical
   zonation of back dune grasses, shrubs, and salt marsh. Evaluation of
   soil quality suggests that nutrients and organic material are not
   limiting recovery. Aeolian transport, however, was demonstrably higher
   across the filled area, where no dense stands of taller plants buffered
   the airflow. Plant re-establishment is suppressed by wind erosion
   inhibiting deposition of seeds. Recovery of the site will likely depend
   on the rhizomatous spread of S. patens from the sound shore. S. patens
   can then potentially facilitate the colonization of other species by
   buffering the wind and trapping seeds of other plants. Ironically, this
   slow recovery may benefit federally threatened bird species that require
   sparse vegetation for nesting success.},

Title = {Building a potential wetland restoration indicator for the contiguous
   United States},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {463-473},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Wetlands provide key functions in the landscape from improving water
   quality, to regulating flows, to providing wildlife habitat. Over half
   of the wetlands in the contiguous United States (CONUS) have been
   converted to agricultural and urban land uses. However, over the last
   several decades, research has shown the benefits of wetlands to
   hydrologic, chemical, biological processes, spurring the. creation of
   government programs and private initiatives to restore wetlands.
   Initiatives tend to focus on individual wetland creation, yet the
   greatest benefits are achieved when strategic restoration planning
   occurs across a watershed or multiple watersheds. For watershed-level
   wetland restoration planning to occur, informative data layers on
   potential wetland areas are needed. We created an indicator of potential
   wetland areas (PWA), using nationally available datasets to identify
   characteristics that could support wetland ecosystems, including: poorly
   drained soils and low-relief landscape positions as indicated by a
   derived topographic data layer. We compared our PWA with the National
   Wetlands Inventory (NWI) from 11 states throughout the CONUS to evaluate
   their alignment. The state-level percentage of NWI-designated wetlands
   directly overlapping the PWA ranged from 39 to 95\%. When we included
   NWI that was immediately adjacent to the overlapping NWI, our range of
   correspondence to NWI ranged from 60 to 99\%. Wetland restoration is
   more likely on certain landscapes (e.g., agriculture) than others due to
   the lack of substantive infrastructure and the potential for the
   restoration of hydrology; therefore, we combined the National Land Cover
   Dataset (NLCD) with the PWA to identify potentially restorable wetlands
   on agricultural land (PRW-Ag). The PRW-Ag identified a total of over 46
   million ha with the potential to support wetlands. The largest
   concentrations of PRW-Ag occurred in the glaciated corn belt of the
   upper Mississippi River from Ohio to the Dakotas and in the Mississippi
   Alluvial Valley. The PRW-Ag layer could assist land managers in
   identifying sites that may qualify for enrollment in conservation
   programs, where planners can coordinate restoration efforts, or where
   decision makers can target resources to optimize the services provided
   across a watershed or multiple watersheds.},

Title = {Fatalities at wind turbines may threaten population viability of a
   migratory bat},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {209},
Pages = {172-177},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Large numbers of migratory bats are killed every year at wind energy
   facilities. However, population-level impacts are unknown as we lack
   basic demographic information about these species. We investigated
   whether fatalities at wind turbines could impact population viability of
   migratory bats, focusing on the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), the
   species most frequently killed by turbines in North America. Using
   expert elicitation and population projection models, we show that
   mortality from wind turbines may drastically reduce population size and
   increase the risk of extinction. For example, the hoary bat population
   could decline by as much as 90\% in the next 50 years if the initial
   population size is near 2.5 million bats and annual population growth
   rate is similar to rates estimated for other bat species (lambda =
   1.01). Our results suggest that wind energy development may pose a
   substantial threat to migratory bats in North America. If viable
   populations are to be sustained, conservation measures to reduce
   mortality from turbine collisions likely need to be initiated soon. Our
   findings inform policy decisions regarding preventing or mitigating
   impacts of energy infrastructure development on wildlife. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Many ecosystems are grazed by livestock or large, wild herbivores and
   exist as mosaics of different vegetation communities. Changing grazing
   could have an impact on heterogeneity as well as on composition. A
   long-term, large-scale grazing experiment that maintained existing
   low-intensity sheep grazing, tripled it, removed it and partially
   substituted sheep grazing by cattle grazing was set up on a mosaic of
   upland vegetation types. The impact of changing grazing regimes was
   assessed in terms of changes in temporal and spatial species and
   functional beta diversity. Removal of grazing had the highest impact on
   species replacement, whilst increased grazing was closest to maintaining
   the original species complement. Wet heath and Molina mire had the
   lowest turnover, but wet heath showed the highest changes in
   unidirectional abundance as it contained species capable of increasing
   in abundance in response to changing grazing intensity. Agrostis-Festuca
   and Nardus grasslands displayed the highest level of balanced species
   replacement reflecting their more dynamic vegetation. In functional
   terms, there was no clear separation of communities based on their
   grazing preference, all were relatively resistant to change but Nardus
   grassland was the most resistant to the removal of grazing. The
   increased offtake associated with increased grazing led to a degree of
   homogenisation as grazing tolerant species associated with preferred
   communities increased in the unpreferred ones. Decisions about grazing
   management of the uplands involve many trade-offs, and this study
   identified potential trade-offs between stability and homogenisation to
   add to existing ones on the biodiversity of different groups of species
   and on ecosystem services.},

Title = {No evidence for an elephant-termite feedback loop in Sand Forest, South
   Africa},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {203},
Pages = {125-133},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Termites and mammalian herbivores might derive mutual benefit from each
   other through positive feedback loops, but empirical evidence is
   lacking. One suggested positive feedback loop is between termites and
   elephant, both ecosystem engineers. Termites, as decomposer organisms,
   contribute to nutrient cycling and soil enrichment, creating hotspots
   with increased forage quality. Elephant are known to select these high
   quality vegetation patches, depositing woody debris when foraging, but
   it is unknown whether elephant presence might affect termites, and if a
   feedback loop between these two taxa exists. We tested this hypothesis
   by measuring termite diversity and activity over three months in the
   summer wet season, inside and outside a long-term (eight years) elephant
   exclosure experiment in Sand Forest at Phinda Private Game Reserve,
   South Africa. Termites were sampled using cellulose baits and woody
   debris was quantified using line transects. Termite activity was not
   affected by eight years of elephant absence, despite a greater volume of
   woody debris where elephant were present. Termite assemblages were
   similarly unaffected by elephant absence. Apart from Schedorhinotermes,
   all other termite genera were sampled in both treatments. Therefore, the
   postulated positive feedback loop between termites and elephant is not
   supported in Sand Forest. However, this does not contradict findings
   that areas with high termite activity positively influence herbivore
   foraging, only that elephant foraging does not affect termite activity.
   This suggests that elephant disturbance (and elephant management
   policies) has little to no effect on termites and the fundamental roles
   they play in ecosystems over at least the short-term. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {Preventing wildlife roadkill can offset mitigation investments in
   short-medium term},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {253},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Wildlife vehicle collisions (WVC) are a threat to wildlife and humans,
   killing millions of animals of numerous species, as well as causing
   significant damage to vehicles, drivers and passengers. Road fencing is
   a highly effective mitigation measure at reducing WVC, however its
   large-scale implementation requires a high investment. We questioned how
   long it would take for savings from avoided collisions to offset the
   investments in road fencing mitigation, focusing on vehicle damage
   costs. Using the information of a 3-year systematic roadkill monitoring
   of 1158 km in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, we estimated the real number
   of casualties accounting for bias in roadkill counting. We obtained
   information on the material costs on cars and trucks due to WVC and,
   considering the road traffic volume characteristics, estimated the total
   material costs resulting from collisions with larger animals.
   Cost-benefit analyses allowed estimating the time required to amortize
   the investment in fencing, considering its application along the full
   surveyed roads or only in hotspots of mortality. We recorded over 10,000
   WVC, 40\% of which involved animals that can cause significant material
   damage to vehicles, namely the endangered lowland tapir (Tapirus
   terrestris, n = 267) and giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla, n =
   608). The average material cost per accident was US\$ 885 +/- 1575 (mean
   +/- SD). We show that investments are likely to pay off in 16-40 years
   for the mitigation of the full roads, and in 9-25 years for hotspots of
   mortality. Thus, road mitigation is a win-win solution for increasing
   traffic safety for humans and reduces road-related negative effects on
   biodiversity.},

Abstract = {A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of
   Brucella spp. and Leptospira spp. and risk factors of exposure in cattle
   in three zones with varying land use types and wildlife-livestock
   interactions. Five villages were selected purposively; two in areas with
   intensive livestock-wildlife interactions (zone 1), another two in areas
   with moderate livestock-wildlife interactions (zone 2) and one in areas
   where wildlife-livestock interactions are rarer (zone 3). Sera samples
   were collected from 1170 cattle belonging to 390 herds in all the zones
   and tested for antibodies against Brucella abortus and Leptospira
   interrogans serovar hardjo using ELISA kits. Data on putative risk
   factors for seropositivity of these pathogens in cattle were collected
   using a questionnaire. The overall apparent animal-level seroprevalence
   of brucellosis and leptospirosis was, respectively, 36.9\% (95\% CI
   34.1-39.8) and 23.5\% (95\% CI 21.1-26.0). Brucella spp. seroprevalence
   was higher in zone 1 than in zones 2 and 3 (chi(2) = 25.1, df = 2, P <
   0.001). Zones 1 and 2 had significantly higher Leptospira spp.
   seroprevalence than zone 3 (chi(2) = 7.0, df = 2, P = 0.029). Results of
   multivariable analyses identified animal sex (female) and zones (high
   interface area) as significant predictors (P < 0.05) of animal-level
   seropositivity of Brucella spp. For Leptospira spp., important
   predictors of animal-level seropositivity were animal sex (female),
   zones (moderate interface area) and herds utilizing a communal grazing
   reserve. The seroprevalences of Brucella spp. and Leptospira spp. in
   cattle were higher in areas with moderate to high wildlife-livestock
   interactions than those with rare interactions.},

Abstract = {After several pandemics over the last two millennia, the wildlife
   reservoirs of plague (Yersinia pestis) now persist around the world,
   including in the western United States. Routine surveillance in this
   region has generated comprehensive records of human cases and animal
   seroprevalence, creating a unique opportunity to test how plague
   reservoirs are responding to environmental change. Here, we test whether
   animal and human data suggest that plague reservoirs and spillover risk
   have shifted since 1950. To do so, we develop a new method for detecting
   the impact of climate change on infectious disease distributions,
   capable of disentangling long-term trends (signal) and interannual
   variation in both weather and sampling (noise). We find that plague foci
   are associated with high-elevation rodent communities, and soil
   biochemistry may play a key role in the geography of long-term
   persistence. In addition, we find that human cases are concentrated only
   in a small subset of endemic areas, and that spillover events are driven
   by higher rodent species richness (the amplification hypothesis) and
   climatic anomalies (the trophic cascade hypothesis). Using our detection
   model, we find that due to the changing climate, rodent communities at
   high elevations have become more conducive to the establishment of
   plague reservoirs-with suitability increasing up to 40\% in some
   places-and that spillover risk to humans at mid-elevations has increased
   as well, although more gradually. These results highlight opportunities
   for deeper investigation of plague ecology, the value of integrative
   surveillance for infectious disease geography, and the need for further
   research into ongoing climate change impacts.},

Title = {Environmental Change and Zoonotic Disease Risk at Human-Macaque
   Interfaces in Bangladesh},
Journal = {ECOHEALTH},

Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {487-499},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic land-use changes increase the frequency of interactions
   and habitat overlap between humans and macaques which play an important
   role in zoonotic disease transmission. This exploratory qualitative
   study aimed to examine connections between land-use change and
   macaque-human interactions and assess the chance of zoonotic disease
   transmission. We conducted ethnographic interviews and focus group
   discussions in Old Dhaka, Madaripur, and Chandpur, Bangladesh.
   Participants reported significant anthropogenic landscape
   transformations leading to increased human-macaque contact in the study
   areas. Participants also reported that all three sites underwent
   substantial landscape alteration from natural or agricultural land to a
   human-altered environment with roads, commercial, and residential
   buildings. Participants noted that the disappearance of forestland
   appeared to increase the macaque dependence on backyard fruit trees.
   Where rivers and ponds were filled to support local construction,
   macaques were also observed as becoming more dependent upon human water
   sources. These changed may help expanding the macaques' foraging areas,
   and they appear to be invading new areas where people are not culturally
   habituated to living with them. In response, many residents reported
   reacting aggressively toward the macaques, which they believed led to
   more bites and scratches. However, other respondents accepted the
   presence of macaques around their homes. Few participants considered
   macaques to be a source of disease transmission. This study revealed
   that local environmental changes, deforestation, urban expansion,
   construction, and water bodies' disappearance are linked to increasing
   human-macaque interactions. Understanding these interactions is critical
   to develop successful mitigation interventions at interfaces with a high
   risk for viral disease spillover.},

Title = {Best practice guidelines for rat eradication on tropical islands},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {185},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {17-26},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Invasive vertebrates are a leading cause of extinction on islands and
   rats (Rattus spp.) are one of the most damaging to island ecosystems.
   Methods to eradicate rats from islands are well established and there
   have been over 580 successful eradications to date. Increasingly, rat
   eradications are being implemented on tropical islands, a reflection of
   the need to protect the threatened biodiversity in the tropics. Yet rat
   eradications on tropical islands fail more frequently than those in
   temperate climates. In an effort to identify the main reasons for the
   lower success rate on tropical islands and possible solutions, a
   workshop was convened with 34 experts in rat eradication, tropical
   rodent and island ecology and toxicology. The workshop focused on
   projects using aerial broadcast of brodifacoum, a 2nd generation
   anticoagulant, because this approach has provided the highest success
   rate for eradicating rodents from islands. The workshop participants
   reviewed previously identified challenges to successful rat eradications
   on tropical islands including increased insect and crab densities
   resulting in competition for bait, year round or unpredictable timing of
   breeding rats and increased or unpredictable availability of
   alternative, natural foods. They also identified a number of new, likely
   reasons for the lower success rate on tropical islands and provided
   recommendations for how to address these risks in the planning and
   implementation of rat eradications. While the success rate of aerial
   broadcast rat eradications in tropical environments is quite high at
   89\% (n = 47), it is hoped that by following the recommended best
   practices provided in this paper, future success rates will be closer to
   the 96.5\% (n = 116) demonstrated for aerial broadcast rat eradications
   on temperate islands. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Wound-healing capabilities of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) and
   implications for conservation management},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {Wound healing is important for marine taxa such as elasmobranchs, which
   can incur a range of natural and anthropogenic wounds throughout their
   life history. There is evidence that this group shows a high capacity
   for external wound healing. However, anthropogenic wounds may become
   more frequent due to increasing commercial and recreational marine
   activities. Whale sharks are particularly at risk of attaining injuries
   given their use of surface waters and wildlife tourism interest. There
   is limited understanding as to how whale sharks recover from injuries,
   and often insights are confined to singular opportunistic observations.
   The present study makes use of a unique and valuable photographic data
   source from two whale shark aggregation sites in the Indian Ocean.
   Successional injury-healing progression cases were reviewed to
   investigate the characteristics of injuries and quantify a coarse
   healing timeframe. Wounds were measured over time using an image
   standardization method. This work shows that by Day 25 major injury
   surface area decreased by an average of 56\% and the most rapid healing
   case showed a surface area reduction of 50\% in 4 days. All wounds
   reached a point of 90\% surface area closure by Day 35. There were
   differences in healing rate based on wound type, with lacerations and
   abrasions taking 50 and 22 days to reach 90\% healing, respectively.
   This study provides baseline information for wound healing in whale
   sharks and the methods proposed could act as a foundation for future
   research. Use of a detailed classification system, as presented here,
   may also assist in ocean scale injury comparisons between research
   groups and aid reliable descriptive data. Such findings can contribute
   to discussions regarding appropriate management in aggregation areas
   with an aim to reduce the likelihood of injuries, such as those
   resulting from vessel collisions, in these regions or during movements
   between coastal waters.},

Abstract = {Wildlife species are often treated with anti-parasitic drugs prior to
   translocation, despite the effects of this treatment being relatively
   unknown. Disruption of normal host-parasite relationships is inevitable
   during translocation, and targeted anti-parasitic drug treatment may
   exacerbate this phenomenon with inadvertent impacts on both target and
   non-target parasite species. Here, we investigate the effects of
   ivermectin treatment on communities of gastrointestinal parasites in
   translocated woylies (Bettongia penicillata). Faecal samples were
   collected at three time points (at the time of translocation, and 1 and
   3 months posttranslocation) and examined for nematode eggs and coccidian
   oocysts. Parasite prevalence and (for nematodes) abundance were
   estimated in both treated and untreated hosts. In our study, a single
   subcutaneous injection of ivermectin significantly reduced
   Strongyloides-like egg counts 1 month post-translocation. Strongyle egg
   counts and coccidia prevalence were not reduced by ivermectin treatment,
   but were strongly influenced by site. Likewise, month of sampling rather
   than ivermectin treatment positively influenced body condition in
   woylies post-translocation. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of
   ivermectin in temporarily reducing Strongyloides-like nematode abundance
   in woylies. We also highlight the possibility that translocation-induced
   changes to host density may influence coinfecting parasite abundance and
   host body condition post-translocation.},

Abstract = {A fundamental gap in climate change vulnerability research is an
   understanding of the relative thermal sensitivity of ectotherms. Aquatic
   insects are vital to stream ecosystem function and biodiversity but
   insufficiently studied with respect to their thermal physiology. With
   global temperatures rising at an unprecedented rate, it is imperative
   that we know how aquatic insects respond to increasing temperature and
   whether these responses vary among taxa, latitudes, and elevations. We
   evaluated the thermal sensitivity of standard metabolic rate in
   stream-dwelling baetid mayflies and perlid stoneflies across a similar
   to 2,000 m elevation gradient in the temperate Rocky Mountains in
   Colorado, USA, and the tropical Andes in Napo, Ecuador. We used
   temperature-controlled water baths and microrespirometry to estimate
   changes in oxygen consumption. Tropical mayflies generally exhibited
   greater thermal sensitivity in metabolism compared to temperate
   mayflies; tropical mayfly metabolic rates increased more rapidly with
   temperature and the insects more frequently exhibited behavioral signs
   of thermal stress. By contrast, temperate and tropical stoneflies did
   not clearly differ. Varied responses to temperature among baetid
   mayflies and perlid stoneflies may reflect differences in evolutionary
   history or ecological roles as herbivores and predators, respectively.
   Our results show that there is physiological variation across elevations
   and species and that low-elevation tropical mayflies may be especially
   imperiled by climate warming. Given such variation among species, broad
   generalizations about the vulnerability of tropical ectotherms should be
   made more cautiously.},

Title = {Reduced salinity tolerance in the Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus)
   is associated with rapid development of a gill interlamellar cell mass:
   implications of high-saline spills on native freshwater salmonids},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) are salmonids that have a strict
   freshwater existence in post-glacial North America. Oil and gas
   development is associated with production of high volumes of hypersaline
   water. With planned industrial expansion into northern areas of Canada
   and the USA that directly overlap grayling habitat, the threat of
   accidental saline water release poses a significant risk. Despite this,
   we understand little about the responses of grayling to hypersaline
   waters. We compared the physiological responses and survivability of
   Arctic grayling and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to tolerate an
   acute transfer to higher saline waters. Arctic grayling and rainbow
   trout were placed directly into 17 ppt salinity and sampled at 24 and 96
   h along with control animals in freshwater at 24 h. Serum sodium,
   chloride and osmolality levels increased significantly in grayling at
   both 24 and 96 h time points, whereas trout were able to compensate for
   the osmoregulatory disturbance by 96 h. Sodium-potassium ATPase mRNA
   expression responses to salinity were also compared, demonstrating the
   inability of the grayling to up-regulate the seawater isoform nka alpha
   1b. Our results demonstrated a substantially lower salinity tolerance in
   grayling. We also found a significant salinity-induced morphological
   gill remodelling by Arctic grayling, as demonstrated by the rapid growth
   of an interlamellar cell mass by 24 h that persisted at 96 h. We
   visualized and quantified the appearance of the interlamellar cell mass
   as a response to high salinity, although the functional significance
   remains to be understood fully. Compared with rainbow trout, which are
   used as an environmental regulatory species, Arctic grayling are unable
   to compensate for the osmotic stressors that would result from a highly
   saline produced water spill. Given these new data, collaboration between
   fisheries and the oil and gas industry will be vital in the long-term
   conservation strategies with regard to the Arctic grayling in their
   native habitat.},

Abstract = {Disease plays a major role in shaping wildlife populations worldwide,
   and changes in landscape conditions can significantly influence risk of
   pathogen exposure, a threat to vulnerable wild species. Three viruses
   that cause hemorrhagic disease affect cervid populations in the USA
   (Odocoileus hemionus adenovirus, bluetongue virus, and epizootic
   hemorrhagic disease virus), but little is known of their distribution
   and prevalence in wild populations. We explored the distribution and
   co-occurrence of seroprevalence of these three pathogens in southern
   mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus fuliginatus), a subspecies of
   conservation concern and a harvested species native to southern
   California, to evaluate the distribution of exposure to these pathogens
   relative to landscape attributes. We found that habitat type, level of
   development, and proximity to livestock may affect hemorrhagic disease
   seroprevalence in southern mule deer. Continued monitoring of
   hemorrhagic disease-causing viruses in areas where deer are in proximity
   to cattle and human development is needed to better understand the
   implications of future outbreaks in wild populations and to identify
   opportunities to mitigate disease impacts in southern mule deer and
   other cervid species.},

Title = {Grow or go? Energetic constraints on shark pup dispersal frompupping
   areas},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Many sharks and other marine taxa use natal areas to maximize survival
   of young, meaning such areas are often attributed conservation value.
   The use of natal areas is often linked to predator avoidance or food
   resources. However, energetic constraints that may influence dispersal
   of young and their use of natal areas are poorly understood. We combined
   swim-tunnel respirometry, calorimetry, lipid class analysis and a
   bioenergetics model to investigate howenergy demands influence dispersal
   of young in a globally distributed shark. The school shark (a.k.a.
   soupfin, tope), Galeorhinus galeus, is Critically Endangered due to
   overfishing and is one of many sharks that use protected natal areas in
   Australia. Energy storage in neonate pups was limited by small livers,
   low overall lipid content and low levels of energy storage lipids (e.g.
   triacylglycerols) relative to adults, with energy stores sufficient to
   sustain routine demands for 1.3-4 days (mean +/- SD: 2.4 +/- 0.8 days).
   High levels of growth-associated structural lipids (e.g. phospholipids)
   and high energetic cost of growth suggested large investment in growth
   during residency in natal areas. Rapid growth (similar to 40\% in
   length) between birth in summer and dispersal in late autumn-winter
   likely increased survival by reducing predation and improving foraging
   ability. Delaying dispersal may allow prioritization of growth and may
   also provide energy savings through improved swimming efficiency and
   cooler ambient temperatures (daily ration was predicted to fall by
   around a third in winter). Neonate school sharks are therefore
   ill-equipped for large-scale dispersal and neonates recorded in the
   northwest of their Australian distribution are likely born locally, not
   at known south-eastern pupping areas. This suggests the existence of
   previously unrecorded school shark pupping areas. Integrated
   bioenergetic approaches as applied here may help to understand dispersal
   from natal areas in other taxa, such as teleost fishes, elasmobranchs
   and invertebrates.},

Abstract = {Where hunting pressure is high, anti-poaching efforts are often crucial
   for protecting native wildlife populations in nature reserves. However,
   many reserves suffer from inadequate support and provisioning of staff,
   especially in developing nations. In Pakke Tiger Reserve in northeastern
   India, we found that malarial infection is a serious hindrance for
   front-line patrolling staff that limits the time they can spend in the
   field. We assessed the consequences of malaria both for local people and
   park staff in the general region and its indirect effects on wildlife
   protection. To accomplish this we compiled data from annual
   epidemiological records of malaria, the number of malaria cases and
   associated mortality, financial costs, and loss of time spent
   patrolling. Over a 4-year period (2006-2009), the majority (71\%) of
   forest department staff in Pakke Tiger Reserve suffered from malaria.
   Malaria treatments cost park managers nearly 3\% of their total budget
   and caused a net loss of 44,160 man hours of anti-poaching effort. The
   government forest and health departments involved in the employment and
   health of park staff have separate missions and responsibilities, yet
   our findings show that a multi-disciplinary approach to conservation is
   essential to avoid overall systemic failure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Burgeoning global demand for products derived from seaweeds is driving
   the increased removal of wild coastal seaweed biomass, an emerging low
   trophic level industry. These products are marketed as organic and
   ``sustainable.{''} Brown macroalgae, such as kelps (Laminariales) and
   rockweeds (Fucales), are foundational species that form underwater
   forests and thus support a diverse vertebrate, invertebrate, and algal
   community-including important commercial species-and deliver organic
   matter to coastal ecosystems. The measure of sustainability used by the
   rockweed (Ascophyllum nodosum (L.) LeJolis) industry, maximum
   sustainable yield, accounts for neither rockweed's role as habitat for
   150+ species, including species of commercial or conservation
   significance, nor its role in coastal and estuarine ecosystems. To
   determine whether rockweed cutting is ``sustainable{''} will require
   data on the long-term and ecosystem-wide impacts of cutting rockweed.
   Once a sustainable level of cutting is determined, strict regulation by
   resource managers will be required to protect rockweed habitat. Until
   sustainable levels of cutting and appropriate regulations are
   identified, commercial-scale rockweed cutting presents a risk to coastal
   ecosystems and the human communities that depend on those ecosystems.},

Title = {The effects of shifting vegetation mosaics on habitat suitability for
   coastal dune fauna-a case study on sand lizards (Lacerta agilis)},

Abstract = {Encroachment of tall grasses and shrubs in coastal dunes has resulted in
   loss of vegetation heterogeneity. This is expected to have negative
   effects on animal diversity. To counteract encroachment and develop
   structural heterogeneity grazing is a widely used management practice.
   Here, we aim to functionally interpret changes in vegetation composition
   and configuration following grazing management on habitat suitability
   for sand lizards. Aerial photographs taken over a period of 16 years
   were used to quantify changes in vegetation composition. A GIS-based
   method was developed to calculate habitat suitability for sand lizards
   in a spatially explicit manner, encompassing differences in vegetation
   structure and patch size. From 1987 to 2003 dune vegetation shifted from
   small patches of moss and sand to larger patches covered by shrubs and
   grasses. Grazing management did not have any significant effect on the
   overall level of heterogeneity, measured as habitat suitability for sand
   lizards. However, on a more local scale highly suitable patches in 1987
   were deteriorating whereas unsuitable patches became more suitable in
   2003. This inversion results from a broad shift with shrubs being a
   limiting habitat element in 1987 to sandy patches being the limiting
   element in 2003. Future changes are believed to negatively impact sand
   lizards. The habitat suitability model has proven to be a useful tool to
   functionally interpret changes in coastal dune vegetation heterogeneity
   from an animal's perspective. Further research should aim to include
   multiple species operating on different scale levels to fully capture
   the natural landscape dynamics.},

Title = {Estimating badger social-group abundance in the Republic of Ireland
   using cross-validated species distribution modelling},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {94-102},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The badger (Meles metes) is an important wildlife host for bovine
   tuberculosis (bTB), and is a reservoir of infection to cattle. Reliable
   indicators of badger abundance at large spatial scales are important for
   informing epidemiological investigation. Thus, we aimed to estimate
   badger social group abundance from a large-scale dataset to provide
   useful information for the management of bTB in the Republic of Ireland
   (ROI). Robust estimates of species abundance require planned systematic
   surveying. This is often unfeasible at large spatial scales, resulting
   in inadequate (biased) data collection. We employed species
   distributional modelling (SDM) using 7724 badger main-sett (burrow)
   locations across the ROI at a I ha scale. This dataset was potentially
   biased as surveying was directed towards areas with cattle
   bTB-breakdowns. In order to manage sampling bias, we developed a model
   where the environment was sampled using pseudoabsences geographically
   constrained to the potential survey area only (constrained model), in
   addition to a model where all of the ROI was sampled (non-constrained
   model). Models predictive performance was assessed using internal
   (splitting the national-scale dataset) and external validation on
   independent datasets; the latter included 278 main setts from a
   local-scale unbiased intensive survey (755 km(2)). Finally, the
   relationship between predicted probability and observed abundance at
   local-scale was used to infer number of social-groups at the national
   level. The geographically constrained model showed moderate
   discriminatory power, but good calibration in both the internal and
   external validations. The non-constrained model resulted in higher
   discrimination but poorer calibration in the internal validation,
   indicating a limitation for national-scale predictions. Interestingly,
   there was a strong cubic relationship between predicted
   probability-classes and observed sett density in the local-area (R-2 =
   0.85 and 0.96; for the non-constrained and the constrained models,
   respectively). At the national-scale, the preferred model predicted a
   total of 19,200 (95\% Confidence Interval: 12,200-27,900) social groups.
   Our analyses demonstrated that under a critical perspective large-scale
   potentially biased datasets can be used to estimate variations in
   species abundance. The abundance predictions are in keeping with recent
   independent estimations of the badger population, and will be a valuable
   index of species abundance for epidemiology (e.g. risk mapping), species
   management (e.g. informing vaccine strategies) and conservation planning
   (e.g. assessing population viability). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The wide-ranging behaviour of large carnivores and low densities at
   which they occur make direct population surveys of these species
   expensive and time consuming, and consequently indirect methods are
   widely used. We compared the accuracy, precision and cost of two methods
   commonly used to survey African lions, namely call-up surveys and
   track-count surveys. Surveys were performed in the 11,000 km(2) northern
   sector of Zambia's Kafue National Park (Kafue), an area for which no
   previous empirical lion population data are available. We estimate lion
   abundance of 200 individuals over 1 year of age in northern Kafue, at a
   density of 1.83 lions 100 km(-2). We used GPS collars and regular
   observations of lions to establish a reference population in an
   Intensive Study Site for comparison with survey results. Both survey
   methods produced accurate results, though precision was higher for
   call-up surveys, despite lower costs. Stratification of the study area
   did not improve the survey estimates. We recommend call-up surveys as
   the most appropriate method for surveying lions in Kafue and similar
   large protected areas, and suggest standardisation of survey equipment
   and protocols.},

Title = {Rangers and modellers collaborate to build and evaluate spatial models
   of African elephant poaching},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {243},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Globally, tens of thousands of wildlife rangers patrol wide areas and
   record evidence of poaching activity such as elephant carcasses and
   snares. Such data have significant potential to inform conservation, but
   patrols are non-random in space and time, so conclusions from raw patrol
   data may be biased. Here we model spatial patterns of elephant poaching
   based on detections of carcasses by ranger patrols in the Zambezi
   Valley, Zimbabwe (201 carcasses, 2000-2017), using different
   methodological scenarios to correct for patrol bias. We follow a
   participatory modelling framework, using interviews with practitioners
   (rangers and managers) to help build and evaluate these models. We found
   that poaching patterns in the bias-corrected scenarios differed among
   themselves and from the uncorrected scenario. Practitioners interrogated
   the credibility of the predictions in each scenario and thus helped
   discern true poaching patterns from those explained by patrol bias. We
   uncovered proximity to water as the strongest driver of poaching, likely
   reflecting both poacher and elephant behaviour. Our results show that it
   is essential to account for observer bias before developing management
   actions (such as ranger patrol strategies) from raw observational data.
   We further demonstrate the value of combining multiple lines of evidence
   (statistical models and interview responses) for more robust inference
   in the face of uncertainty.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper presents an approach that allows production of benthic
   substrate and habitat maps in fjord environments. This approach is used
   to support the management of the Gilbert Bay Marine Protected Area (MPA)
   in southeastern Labrador, Atlantic Canada. Multibeam sonar-derived
   bathymetry, seabed slope, and acoustic reflectance (backscatter) were
   combined using supervised classification methods and GIS with
   ground-truthed benthic sampling in order to derive maps of the
   substrates and main benthic habitats. Six acoustically distinct
   substrate types were identified in the fjord, and three additional
   substrate types without a unique acoustic signature were recognized.
   Ordination by multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity
   generalized these to four acoustically distinct habitat types. Greatest
   within-habitat (alpha) diversity was found in the coralline-algae
   encrusted gravel habitat. Greatest between-habitat (beta) diversity was
   found in the management Zones 1 and 2, which have the highest level of
   protection. The study confirmed that the zoning plan for the MPA, which
   was designed to protect spawning and juvenile fish habitat for a local
   genetically distinct population of Atlantic cod, afforded highest levels
   of protection to areas with highest habitat diversity.},

   citizen scientists},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Observations made by citizen-scientists are highly regarded in many
   fields of biology. Public participation in research leads to increased
   environmental stewardship, greater data-acquisition, and
   multi-disciplinary ad-vances. However, to date, there is a paucity of
   literature that acknowledges the professional benefits we, as
   scientists, gain through open consultation and two-way collaboration
   with interested parties. Citizen scientists often have specialised
   interests in particular taxa or habitats. They spend much time observing
   their subjects/s of interest, becoming accustomed to subtle nuances in
   appearance, behaviour, or dynamics that are challenging to detect
   without a high level of familiarity. In a world where professional
   researchers must increasingly balance competing demands on their time,
   and demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of their research, we stand to
   benefit by acknowledging the specific expertise of amateurs and the
   value their experience brings to observations. We use marine ornithology
   as an exemplar of this discussion - reasoning that data quality can be
   greatly improved by collaboration with expert amateurs, concomitantly
   improving the outcomes from research for conservation and management. We
   encourage researchers surveying wildlife, plant life, and other
   organisms to consider where their information and skills may come from,
   and close the loop between citizens and science to make the most of what
   amateur naturalism has to offer.},

Title = {Sex-Biased Inbreeding Effects on Reproductive Success and Home Range
   Size of the Critically Endangered Black Rhinoceros},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {594-603},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A central premise of conservation biology is that small populations
   suffer reduced viability through loss of genetic diversity and
   inbreeding. However, there is little evidence that variation in
   inbreeding impacts individual reproductive success within remnant
   populations of threatened taxa, largely due to problems associated with
   obtaining comprehensive pedigree information to estimate inbreeding. In
   the critically endangered black rhinoceros, a species that experienced
   severe demographic reductions, we used model selection to identify
   factors associated with variation in reproductive success (number of
   offspring). Factors examined as predictors of reproductive success were
   age, home range size, number of nearby mates, reserve location, and
   multilocus heterozygosity (a proxy for inbreeding). Multilocus
   heterozygosity predicted male reproductive success (p< 0.001, explained
   deviance >58\%) and correlated with male home range size (p < 0.01, r(2)
   > 44\%). Such effects were not apparent in females, where reproductive
   success was determined by age (p < 0.01, explained deviance 34\%) as
   females raise calves alone and choose between, rather than compete for,
   mates. This first report of a 3-way association between an individual
   male's heterozygosity, reproductive output, and territory size in a
   large vertebrate is consistent with an asymmetry in the level of
   intrasexual competition and highlights the relevance of sex-biased
   inbreeding for the management of many conservation-priority species. Our
   results contrast with the idea that wild populations of threatened taxa
   may possess some inherent difference from most nonthreatened populations
   that necessitates the use of detailed pedigrees to study inbreeding
   effects. Despite substantial variance in male reproductive success, the
   increased fitness of more heterozygous males limits the loss of
   heterozygosity. Understanding how individual differences in genetic
   diversity mediate the outcome of intrasexual competition will be
   essential for effective management, particularly in enclosed
   populations, where individuals have restricted choice about home range
   location and where the reproductive impact of translocated animals will
   depend upon the background distribution in individual heterozygosity.
   Efectos de la Endogamia Sesgada por el Sexo sobre el Exito Reproductivo
   y el Rango del Tamano de Habitat del Rinoceronte Negro, Especie en
   Peligro Critico
   Resumen Una premisa central de la biologia de la conservacion es que las
   poblaciones pequenas padecen de viabilidad reducida por medio de la
   perdida de la diversidad genetica y la endogamia. Sin embargo hay poca
   evidencia de que la variacion en la endogamia impacta el exito
   reproductivo individual dentro de las poblaciones remanentes de un taxon
   amenazado, principalmente debido a los problemas asociados con la
   obtencion de informacion integral del linaje para estimar la endogamia.
   Con el rinoceronte negro, especie en peligro critico que sufrio
   reducciones demograficas severas, usamos un modelo de seleccion para
   identificar factores asociados con el exito reproductivo (numero de
   descendientes). Los factores que se examinaron como indicadores del
   exito reproductivo fueron la edad, el tamano del habitat, el numero de
   parejas cercanas, ubicacion en la reserva y heterocigocidad multilocus
   (un indicador de endogamia). La heterocigocidad multilocus predijo el
   exito reproductivo de los machos (p < 0.01, desviacion explicada >58\%)
   y tuvo correlacion con el tamano de habitat de los machos (p < 0.01,
   r(2) > 44\%). Tales efectos no fueron aparentes con las hembras, donde
   el exito reproductivo estuvo determinado por la edad (p < 0.01,
   desviacion explicada 34\%), ya que las hembras crian solas a los
   becerros y escogen a su pareja, en lugar de luchar por ella. El primer
   reporte de una asociacion de tres vias entre la heterocigocidad de un
   macho individual, la salida reproductiva y el tamano del territorio en
   un vertebrado de gran tamano es consistente con una asimetria en el
   nivel de competencia intrasexual y resalta la relevancia de la endogamia
   con sesgo de sexo para el manejo de muchas especies con prioridad de
   conservacion. Nuestros resultados contrastan con la idea de que las
   poblaciones silvestres de un taxon amenazado pueden poseer alguna
   diferencia inherente de la mayoria de las poblaciones no amenazadas que
   exige el uso de linajes detallados para estudiar los efectos de la
   endogamia. A pesar de la varianza sustancial en el exito reproductivo de
   los machos, la aptitud incrementada de mas machos heterocigotos limita
   la perdida de la heterocigocidad. Entender como las diferencias
   individuales en la diversidad genetica moderan el resultado de la
   competencia intrasexual sera esencial para un manejo efectivo,
   particularmente en poblaciones adjuntas, donde los individuos tienen
   opciones restringidas de tamano de habitat y donde el impacto
   reproductivo de animales translocados dependera del trasfondo de la
   distribucion en la heterocigocidad individual.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The One Health approach has gained support across a range of
   disciplines; however, training opportunities for professionals seeking
   to operationalize the interdisciplinary approach are limited. Academic
   institutions, through the development of high-quality, experiential
   training programs that focus on the application of professional
   competencies, can increase accessibility to One Health education. TheRx
   One Health Summer Institute, jointly led by US and East African
   partners, provides a model for such a program. In 2017, 21 participants
   representing five countries completed theRx One Healthprogram in East
   Africa. Participants worked collaboratively with communities neighboring
   wildlife areas to better understand issues impacting human and animal
   health and welfare, livelihoods, and conservation. One Health topics
   were explored through community engagement and role-playing exercises,
   field-based health surveillance activities, laboratories, and
   discussions with local experts. Educational assessments reflected
   improvements in participants' ability to apply the One Health approach
   to health and disease problem solving, as well as anticipate
   cross-sectoral challenges to its implementation. The experiential
   learning method, specifically the opportunity to engage with local
   communities, proved to be impactful on participants' cultural awareness.
   TheRx One Health Summer Institutetraining model may provide an effective
   and implementable strategy by which to contribute to the development of
   a global One Health workforce.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {242},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is an iconic species of
   conservation. However, long-term monitoring of wild giant pandas has
   been a challenge, largely due to the lack of appropriate method for the
   identification of target panda individuals. Although there are some
   traditional methods, such as distance-bamboo stem fragments methods,
   molecular biological method, and manual visual identification, they all
   have some limitations that can restrict their application. Therefore, it
   is urgent to explore a reliable and efficient approach to identify giant
   panda individuals. Here, we applied the deep learning technology and
   developed a novel face-identification model based on convolutional
   neural network to identify giant panda individuals. The model was able
   to identify 95\% of giant panda individuals in the validation dataset.
   In all simulated field situations where the quality of photo data was
   degraded, the model still accurately identified more than 90\% of panda
   individuals. The identification accuracy of our model is robust to
   brightness, small rotation, and cleanness of photos, although large
   rotation angle (> 20 degrees) of photos has significant influence on the
   identification accuracy of the model (P < 0.01). Our model can be
   applied in future studies of giant panda such as long-term monitoring,
   big data analysis for behavior and be adapted for individual
   identification of other wildlife species.},

Title = {The political economy of human-wildlife conflict and coexistence},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {260},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Researchers have highlighted a conspicuous dearth of analysis focused on
   political-economic structures and processes in the rapidly expanding
   literature exploring human-wildlife conflict and coexistence. In this
   paper, we respond by highlighting the importance of attending to the
   influence of such dynamics in understanding and addressing both conflict
   and coexistence in human-wildlife interactions in particular locations
   and well as across levels and scales. We describe how analysis from the
   perspective of the capitalist political economy and the ``uneven
   geographical development{''} (UGD) it produces can help to shed light on
   how different forms of such interaction arise in specific places and
   times. We illustrate this mode of analysis through comparative
   discussion of two contrasting case studies of human-wildlife interaction
   in Costa Rica and Bulgaria. We demonstrate how the particular
   positioning of our research sites within the overarching societies - as
   well as each society's positioning within an evolving capitalist
   world-system - encourages either conflict or coexistence between people
   and wildlife depending on this positioning. We conclude by calling for
   more researchers to also explore the overarching political-economic
   structures shaping human-wildlife interaction in their own contexts of
   study in order to more effectively address this important formative
   factor in patterns of conflict as well as coexistence.},

Abstract = {Current wildlife trade practices in China lead to significant
   interactions between humans and animals and drive the emergence of
   zoonotic diseases. The at-risk behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes that
   influence health-related behaviors in relation to animal contact and
   safety measures in the trade remain poorly understood. A
   self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted among 947 adult
   Internet users in three provinces in southern China to assess knowledge,
   perceived disease risks, at-risk behaviors, and the association of these
   factors with other demographic factors among the target population. Few
   of the participants possessed sufficient knowledge of zoonotic diseases.
   Although most participants were opposed to the use of wild animal
   resources, many reported keeping wild animals as pets (30.7\%) and
   eating wild animals (30.5\%). The majority of participants (76.3\%)
   believed the disease transmission via wildlife trade, but few connected
   contact with animals to sickness (18.5\%) and only slightly more than
   half sought post-exposure treatment (54.4\%). These results reveal low
   levels of knowledge and perceived risk regarding disease emergence from
   the animal-human interactions in wildlife trade and uncover the gaps in
   knowledge and attitudes as key challenges to the development of health
   behavior change interventions pertaining to wildlife trade.},

Title = {Network analysis of a stakeholder community combatting illegal wildlife
   trade},

Abstract = {The illegal wildlife trade has emerged as a growing and urgent
   environmental issue. Stakeholders involved in the efforts to curb
   wildlife trafficking include nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),
   academia, and state government and enforcement bodies. The extent to
   which these stakeholders work and communicate among each other is
   fundamental to effectively combatting illicit trade. Using the United
   Kingdom as a case study, we used a social network analysis and
   semistructured interviews of stakeholders to assess communication
   relationships in the counter wildlife trafficking community. The NGOs
   consistently occupied 4 of the 5 most central positions in the generated
   networks, whereas academic institutions routinely occupied 4 of the 5
   most peripheral positions. However, NGOs were the least diverse in their
   communication practices compared with the other stakeholder groups.
   Stakeholders identified personal relationships as the most important
   aspect of functioning communication. Participant insights also showed
   that stakeholder-specific variables (e.g., ethical and confidentiality
   concerns), competition, and fundraising can have a confounding effect on
   intercommunication. Evaluating communication networks and
   intrastakeholder communication trends is essential to creating cohesive,
   productive, and efficient responses to the challenges of combatting
   illegal wildlife trade. Article impact statement: Communication among
   those combatting illegal wildlife trade is confounded by stakeholder
   variables (ethics, confidentiality), competition, and fundraising.},

Title = {How anthropogenic noise affects foraging},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3278-3289},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The influence of human activity on the biosphere is increasing. While
   direct damage (e.g. habitat destruction) is relatively well understood,
   many activities affect wildlife in less apparent ways. Here, we
   investigate how anthropogenic noise impairs foraging, which has direct
   consequences for animal survival and reproductive success. Noise can
   disturb foraging via several mechanisms that may operate simultaneously,
   and thus, their effects could not be disentangled hitherto. We developed
   a diagnostic framework that can be applied to identify the potential
   mechanisms of disturbance in any species capable of detecting the noise.
   We tested this framework using Daubenton's bats, which find prey by
   echolocation. We found that traffic noise reduced foraging efficiency in
   most bats. Unexpectedly, this effect was present even if the playback
   noise did not overlap in frequency with the prey echoes. Neither
   overlapping noise nor nonoverlapping noise influenced the search effort
   required for a successful prey capture. Hence, noise did not mask prey
   echoes or reduce the attention of bats. Instead, noise acted as an
   aversive stimulus that caused avoidance response, thereby reducing
   foraging efficiency. We conclude that conservation policies may
   seriously underestimate numbers of species affected and the multilevel
   effects on animal fitness, if the mechanisms of disturbance are not
   considered.},

Title = {Assessing the Potential to Restore Historic Grazing Ecosystems with
   Tortoise Ecological Replacements},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {690-700},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The extinction of large herbivores, often keystone species, can
   dramatically modify plant communities and impose key biotic thresholds
   that may prevent an ecosystem returning to its previous state and
   threaten native biodiversity. A potentially innovative, yet
   controversial, landscape-based long-term restoration approach is to
   replace missing plant-herbivore interactions with non-native herbivores.
   Aldabran giant (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and Madagascan radiated
   (Astrochelys radiata) tortoises, taxonomically and functionally similar
   to the extinct Mauritian giant tortoises (Cylindraspis spp.), were
   introduced to Round Island, Mauritius, in 2007 to control the non-native
   plants that were threatening persistence of native species. We monitored
   the response of the plant community to tortoise grazing for 11 months in
   enclosures before the tortoises were released and, compared the cost of
   using tortoises as weeders with the cost of using manual labor. At the
   end of this period, plant biomass; vegetation height and cover; and
   adult, seedling, flower, and seed abundance were 3-136 times greater in
   adjacent control plots than in the tortoise enclosures. After their
   release, the free-roaming tortoises grazed on most non-native plants and
   significantly reduced vegetation cover, height, and seed production,
   reflecting findings from the enclosure study. The tortoises generally
   did not eat native species, although they consumed those native species
   that increased in abundance following the eradication of mammalian
   herbivores. Our results suggest that introduced non-native tortoises are
   a more cost-effective approach to control non-native vegetation than
   manual weeding. Numerous long-term outcomes (e.g., change in species
   composition and soil seed bank) are possible following tortoise
   releases. Monitoring and adaptive management are needed to ensure that
   the replacement herbivores promote the recovery of native plants.},

Title = {Urofaecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations in African penguin
   (Spheniscus demersus) chick populations experiencing different levels of
   human disturbance},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Despite the importance of ecotourism in species conservation, little is
   known about the industry's effects on wildlife. In South Africa, some
   African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) colonies have become tourist
   attractions. The species is globally endangered, with population sizes
   decreasing over the past 40 years. AsAfrican penguin chicks are
   altricial and unable tomove away fromanthropogenic stressors, it is
   important to evaluate the effect of tourist activities on baseline
   glucocorticoid levels as a measure of potential disturbance. Chicks at
   three study sites within two breeding colonies (Robben Island, Stony
   Point), with varying levels of exposure to tourism (low/moderate/high)
   were monitored. Urofaecal samples were collected to determine urofaecal
   glucocorticoid metabolite (ufGCM) concentrations as an indication of
   baseline stress physiology. Morphometric measurements were taken to
   compare body condition between sites. Penguin chicks experiencing low,
   infrequent human presence had significantly higher mean (+/- standard
   deviation) ufGCM levels {[}1.34 +/- 1.70 mu g/g dry weight (DW)]
   compared to chicks experiencing both medium (0.50 +/- 0.40 mu g/g DW, P=
   0.001) and high levels of human presence (0.57 +/- 0.47 mu g/g DW, P=
   0.003). There was no difference in chick body condition across sites.
   These results suggest that exposure to frequent human activity may
   induce habituation/desensitization in African penguin chicks. Acute,
   infrequent human presence was likely an important driver for
   comparatively higher ufGCM levels in chicks, though several other
   environmental stressors may also play an important role in driving
   adrenocortical activity. Nevertheless, as unhabituated chicks
   experiencing infrequent anthropogenic presence showed significantly
   higher ufGCM levels, managers and legislation should attempt to minimize
   all forms of activity around important breeding colonies that are not
   already exposed to regular tourism. Although the results of this study
   are crucial for developing enhanced conservation and management
   protocols, additional research on the long-term effect of anthropogenic
   activities on African penguin physiology is required.},

Abstract = {Scavenging is an important function within ecosystems where scavengers
   remove organic matter, reduce disease, stabilize food webs, and
   generally make ecosystems more resilient to environmental changes.
   Global change (i.e., changing climate and increasing human impact) is
   currently influencing scavenger communities. Thus, understanding what
   promotes species richness in scavenger communities can help prioritize
   management actions. Using a long-term dataset from camera traps deployed
   with animal carcasses as bait along a 1881 km latitudinal gradient in
   the Appalachian Mountains of eastern USA, we investigated the relative
   impact of climate and humans on the species richness and diversity of
   vertebrate scavengers. Our most supported models for both mammalian and
   avian scavengers included climatic, but not human, variables. The
   richness of mammalian and avian scavengers detected was highest during
   relatively warm (5-10 degrees C) and dry (100-150 mm precipitation)
   winters, when food was likely limited and both reliance on and detection
   of carrion was high. The diversity of mammalian and avian scavengers
   detected was highest under drier conditions. We then used these results
   to project the future species richness of scavengers that would be
   detected within our sampling area and under the climate scenario of 2070
   (emissions level RCP8.5). Our predictions suggest up to 80\% and 67\%
   reductions, respectively, in the richness of avian and mammalian
   scavengers that would be detected at baited sites. Climate-induced
   shifts in behavior (i.e., reduction in scavenging, even if present) at
   this scale could have cascading implications for ecosystem function,
   resilience, and human health. Further, our study highlights the
   importance of conducting studies of scavenger community dynamics within
   ecosystems across wide spatial gradients within temperate environments.
   More broadly, these findings build upon our understanding of the impacts
   of climate-induced adjustments in behavior that can likely have negative
   impacts on systems at a large scale.},

Title = {On the relationships among diversity, productivity and climate from an

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5, SI},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The relationships among diversity, productivity and climate are complex,
   especially in tropical ecosystems; and are less studied. We studied here
   the bi- and tri-partite relationships between and among the plant
   diversity, productivity and climate variables (i.e., temperature,
   precipitation and moisture) in a tropical ecosystem in India by
   analyzing three forest types for the year 2010. Comparison of
   productivity (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model derived-net primary
   productivity, NPP) and climate condition with respect to 2001 showed
   significant increase in NPP and temperature and overall decrease in
   precipitation and moisture condition in last decade. The NPP for sal
   forest ranged from 579.4 to 1,142 for the year 2001 and 557.2 to 1231.6
   g Cm-2 year(-1) for the year 2010. The mean monthly temperature varied
   from 18 to 21.8A degrees C and 26 to 27A degrees C; and the annual
   precipitation varied from 15 to 45 and 32 to 76 cm/year for the year
   2001 and 2010 respectively. Strong correlation was observed between
   monthly mean temperature and productivity during 2001, while a decrease
   was observed during the year 2010. The ecosystem has shown a trend of
   rapid drying in last decade, triggering more detail studies for
   understanding of the eco-climatology. In general, sal forest, a natural
   forest sowed higher diversity and productivity followed by mixed
   deciduous (MD) forest and teak plantation. Though, areas with higher NPP
   are well correlated with higher temperature, precipitation and moisture;
   they seem to be related to species density rather than diversity.
   However, there is a need to have year-on-year assessments in order to
   ascertain if this difference represents a real phenomenon rather than an
   artefact of sampling. The pilot study helps in understanding the complex
   relationships and is very useful in the fast changing climate.},

Title = {Increased tree densities in South African savannas: > 50 years of data
   suggests CO2 as a driver},

Abstract = {For the past century, woody plants have increased in grasslands and
   savannas worldwide. Woody encroachment may significantly alter ecosystem
   functioning including fire regimes, herbivore carrying capacity,
   biodiversity and carbon storage capacity. Traditionally, increases in
   woody cover and density have been ascribed to changes in the disturbance
   regime (fire and herbivores) or rainfall. Increased atmospheric CO2
   concentrations may also contribute, by increasing growth rates of trees
   relative to grasses. This hypothesis is still heavily debated because
   usually potential CO2 effects are confounded by changes in land use
   (disturbance regime). Here we analyse changes in woody density in fire
   experiments at three sites in South African savannas where the
   disturbance regime (fire and herbivores) was kept constant for 30 and 50
   years. If global drivers had significant effects on woody plants, we
   would expect significant increases in tree densities and biomass over
   time under the constant disturbance regime. Woody density remained
   constant in a semiarid savanna but tripled in a mesic savanna between
   the 1970s and 1990s. At the third site, a semiarid savanna near the
   southern limits of the biome, tree density doubled from the mid 1990s to
   2010. Interpretation of the causes is confounded by population recovery
   after clearing, but aerial photograph analysis on adjacent non-cleared
   areas showed an accompanying 48\% increase in woody cover. Increased CO2
   concentrations are consistent with increased woody density while other
   global drivers (rainfall) remained constant over the duration of the
   experiments. The absence of a response in one semiarid savanna could be
   explained by a smaller carbon sink capacity of the dominant species,
   which would therefore benefit less from increased CO2. Understanding how
   savannas and grasslands respond to increased CO2 and identifying the
   causes of woody encroachment are essential for the successful management
   of these systems.},

Title = {An evidence-based approach to specifying survey effort in ecological
   assessments of bat activity},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {231},
Pages = {98-102},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Robust ecological assessments are fundamental for effective wildlife
   conservation. Owing to the high legal protection of bats, surveys are
   frequently required as part of ecological assessments. Yet there is
   uncertainty about the amount of survey effort that should be deployed to
   facilitate bat protection. Bat activity can be extremely variable, and
   capturing periods of high activity can be as important as estimating
   parameters such as the median activity level. However the frequency and
   intensity of surveys required to capture the required information is
   unknown. Here we assessed the probability that acoustic surveys of
   differing durations would detect periods of high activity within a focal
   site and the importance of a site relative to others in a regional or
   national context. We randomly subsampled from 660 nights of activity
   data collected from 33 wind farm sites across Britain. The minimum
   surveying effort required to classify bat activity accurately varied
   between species and was dependent on weather conditions. We found that
   the survey periods required to give reasonable certainty in assessing
   risk exceeded those currently recommended in Europe. The approach of
   using bat activity accumulation curves, as described here, is
   transferrable to other situations where determining surveying effort and
   risk is necessary to ensure that ecological assessments provide a robust
   evidence base, whilst minimising the time and expense of surveys.},

Journal = {ECOHEALTH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {518-529},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Wild populations of the critically endangered woylie (Bettongia
   penicillata) recently declined by 90\% in southwest Western Australia.
   Increased predation is the leading hypothesis for decline, but disease
   may be playing a role increasing susceptibility to predation. To explore
   this possibility, we surveyed woylie populations in the wild, in
   captivity and in a predator-free sanctuary for exposure to, and
   infection with, four known pathogens of macropods: herpesviruses, Wallal
   and Warrego orbiviruses, and Toxoplasma gondii. Our study found two of
   68 individuals positive for neutralizing antibodies against known
   macropodid alphaherpesviruses. Three of 45 individuals were PCR positive
   for a herpesvirus that was shown to be a novel gammaherpesvirus or a new
   strain/variant of Potoroid Herpesvirus 1. Further sequence information
   is required to definitively determine its correct classification. There
   was no evidence of antibodies to orbivirus Wallal and Warrego
   serogroups, and all serological samples tested for T. gondii were
   negative. This is the first report of PCR and serological detection of
   herpesviruses in the woylie. Positive individuals did not demonstrate
   clinical signs of herpesviral diseases; therefore, the clinical
   significance of herpesviruses to wild woylie populations remains
   unclear. Further monitoring for herpesvirus infections will be important
   to inform disease risk analysis for this virus and determine temporal
   trends in herpesvirus activity that may relate to population health and
   conservation outcomes.},

   caused by presence of infrastructure, not noise},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {218},
Pages = {124-133},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that explain why oil infrastructure has an
   effect on wildlife, and comparing effects of different types of
   infrastructure, is necessary for determining how we may minimize or
   mitigate those effects. We compared the abundances of five grassland
   songbird species at oil well sites with different pump mechanisms and
   power sources, and determined the effects of exotic vegetation, perch
   sites, and road densities. We compared effects of wells that were active
   with effects of wells that were turned off to evaluate whether effects
   of wells were caused by noise or human activity at wells. We conducted
   800-m abundance transects at 42 sites twice per year in 2013 and 2014 in
   Alberta, Canada. Two species at risk, Baird's sparrows (Ammodramus
   bairdii) and Sprague's pipits (Anthus spragueii), had significantly
   lower abundances at all sites that contained oil infrastructure.
   However, there was little evidence that noise, human activity, or
   traffic explained these effects. Effects of active and inactive wells
   were the same, and grid-powered wells had a greater effect than did
   generator-powered wells, although generator-powered wells are louder.
   Our research suggests that reducing noise, human activity or traffic
   would not reduce the effects of wells on grassland songbirds, and,
   therefore, mitigation must focus on minimizing the extent of
   above-ground infrastructure.},

Number = {5},

Abstract = {The relatively low population size and long adult lifespan of
   dragonflies (Odonata, Anisoptera) makes them one of the few
   non-vertebrate groups likely to be impacted by direct roadway mortality.
   We studied adult dragonfly mortality and behavior associated with
   roadways for a number of species. Daily mortality rates for dragonflies
   were estimated from standardized surveys along predetermined lengths of
   roads. Relative abundance and flight behavior around and across
   roadways, a potentially important mortality factor, was determined from
   timed roadside observations. Observed flight behavior provided no
   evidence that roads act as significant barriers to dispersal for adult
   dragonflies. Estimated mean number killed ranged from 2 to 35
   dragonflies/km/day. Species varied greatly in their susceptibility to
   motor vehicles. Two species (Plathemis lydia and Libellula luctuosa)
   made up more than 70\% of the dead dragonflies collected, but only
   represented 14\% and 31\% of live dragonflies observed, respectively.
   The relatively low flight heights of these two species over roads
   (typically under 2 m) may explain their susceptibility; however, another
   common species (Tramea lacerata) also exhibited low flight height but
   did not experience high mortality, possibly because of its increased
   flight agility. Large numbers of adult dragonflies were killed over the
   entire flight season by motor vehicle collisions, exhibiting the need
   for assessing the long-term impact of roadway mortality on dragonfly
   population dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Five selected forms (claws, skins, skulls, teeth, and trophies) of
   American black bear (Ursus americanus) were used to demonstrate how
   variable the volume of total international trade can be based on
   different approaches. Records from the comparative tabulations of the
   CITES Trade Database were presented in three ways: (1) identical data
   from both the exporter and the importer (4\%), (2) traded volume
   reported by the exporter and importer differed (21\%), and (3) traded
   volume reported either by exporter or importer only (75\%). Six types of
   calculations were used to assess the total trade volume of selected
   American black bear forms. Proportional deviances of alternatively
   calculated traded volumes from their respective maxima significantly
   differed between individual calculations. However, these deviances were
   consistent between forms. The average difference between maximum and
   minimum calculated traded volume was 63 +/- 23\%. The most striking
   difference was found in trophies, where this difference represented
   108,269 trophies in absolute terms. Specific changes to improve the
   usability of the CITES Trade Database are recommended and include the
   following: (1) combining the permit number with export and import
   reports to allow unmistakable identification of the entire trade flow,
   (2) unambiguous specification of the method of calculating volumes of
   both gross and net trade tabulations in the database guide, (3) better
   specification and avoidance of possible confusion of terms (forms), and
   (4) prohibition of automatically assigning value to empty fields.},

Title = {Erosion status of a sea cliff promontory bounding an ecologically
   important beach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {The study attempts to assess the retreat of a section of a bounding sea
   cliff promontory, exposed to wave forcing from both sides, of an
   important Mediterranean sea-turtle nesting beach, within a Mediterranean
   marine protected area (Gerakas, Zakynthos Island, Greece). Morphological
   changes were monitored within a 2-year period using a terrestrial laser
   scanner and the findings were compared with those from historical
   ortho-photographs to estimate sea cliff erosion the last 20 years. An
   advanced wave model supplemented by a model for cliff notch evolution,
   as well as an analytical model were also used to estimate cliff erosion
   due to wave attack. Comparisons of sea cliff profiles and calculations
   of volumetric changes using the collected and historical topographic
   data showed an average annual recession of about 0.16 m for the period
   1997-2016. By comparison, coastal modeling estimated a retreat of about
   0.23 m/yr, whereas a 0.14-0.3 m/y recession was assessed by the
   analytical approach; this reasonable discrepancy with the empirical
   results, is probably caused, amongst others, by the fact that the models
   does not account for the protection of cliff toes by a constant supply
   of erosion debris from above. The wave model was also used to estimate
   sea cliff retreat rates under a 0.5 m sea level rise and showed a
   fourfold increase compared with the current recession rate. On the basis
   of these results, as well as considerations related to the seismicity of
   the study area, it appears that the factors responsible for the sea
   cliff retreat are wave action, precipitation-induced surface flows, and
   earthquake-related instabilities that may cause rapid, large-scale
   erosion. The outcomes of this study are highlighting the critical
   interplay of several natural factors and climatic change effect on
   driving coastal erosion, which consequently results in the loss of
   ecologically critical habitats, thereby challenging conservation goals
   and management effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Understanding individual attitudes and how these predict overt
   opposition to predator conservation or direct, covert action against
   predators will help to recover and maintain them. Studies of attitudes
   toward wild animals rely primarily on samples of individuals at a single
   time point. We examined longitudinal change in individuals' attitudes
   toward gray wolves (Canis lupus). In the contiguous United States,
   amidst persistent controversy and opposition, abundances of gray wolves
   are at their highest in 60 years. We used mailed surveys to sample 1892
   residents of Wisconsin in 2001 or 2004 and then resampled 656 of these
   individuals who resided in wolf range in 2009. Our study spanned a
   period of policy shifts and increasing wolf abundance. Over time, the
   656 respondents increased agreement with statements reflecting fear of
   wolves, the belief that wolves compete with hunters for deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus), and inclination to poach a wolf. Endorsement of lethal
   control of wolves by the state and public hunting of wolves also
   increased. Neither the time span over which respondents reported
   exposure to wolves locally nor self-reported losses of domestic animals
   to wolves correlated with changes in attitude. We predict future
   increases in legal and illegal killing of wolves that may reduce their
   abundance in Wisconsin unless interventions are implemented to improve
   attitudes and behavior toward wolves. To assess whether interventions
   change attitudes, longitudinal studies like ours are needed.},

Abstract = {Upsurge of antibiotic resistance in wildlife poses unprecedented threat
   to wildlife conservation. Surveillance of antibiotic resistance at the
   human-wildlife interface is therefore needed. We evaluated differences
   in antibiotic resistance of Escherichia coli isolates from human and the
   endangered black rhinoceros in Lambwe Valley, Kenya. We used standard
   microbiological techniques to carry out susceptibility assays using
   eight antibiotics of clinical and veterinary importance. Standard PCR
   method was used to characterize antibiotic resistance genes. There was
   no difference in resistance between E. coli isolates from human and
   those from rhinoceros (U = 25, p = 0.462). However, higher resistance in
   isolates from humans was noted for cotrimoxazole (p = 0.000, OR =
   0.101), ceftriaxone (p = 0.005, OR = 0.113) and amoxicillin/clavulanic
   acid (p = 0.017, OR = 0.258), whereas isolates from rhinoceros showed
   higher gentamicin resistance (p = 0.001, OR = 10.154). Multi-drug
   resistance phenotype was 69.0\% in humans and 43.3\% in rhinoceros.
   Isolates from both species contained bla(TEM), tetA, tetB, dfrA1 and
   sul1 genes. Resistance profiles in the two species suggest potential for
   cross-transfer of resistance genes or exposure to comparable selective
   pressure and call for a multi-sectorial action plan on surveillance of
   antibiotic resistance at the human-wildlife interface. Genome-wide
   studies are needed to explicate the direction of transfer of genes that
   confer antibiotic resistance at the human-wildlife interface.},

Abstract = {For some wildlife commodities, rare species are especially sought after.
   The tendency for rare commodities to be of higher value can fuel their
   exploitation and as numbers dwindle, the demand can increase.
   Consequently, this can precipitate these rare species into an
   overexploitation vortex where they become increasingly rare, valued and
   exploited until eventual extinction. We focus here on the hobby of
   collecting stag beetles, to ascertain if the market value of these items
   is driven by rarity and if, consequently, these species are vulnerable
   to this overexploitation vortex. Stag beetle collections fuel a large
   and lucrative market in Japan, involving more than 700 species from all
   over the world, with over 15 million specimens imported a year. Some
   particularly valued species fetch more than US\$5,000 a piece. We
   assessed the importance of species rarity as an acquisition criterion in
   this market using two methods: an Internet online questionnaire
   responded to by 509 participants and through examining the quantities
   imported in Japan and prices paid by collectors. We discovered that
   species rarity is one of the main choice criteria for acquisition by
   collectors: rare stag beetles are valued more than the common species
   and, consequently, stag beetles are vulnerable to the anthropogenic
   Allee effect in this market. Because of the sheer size of the market and
   the pervasive nature of this rarity paradox, the attraction to rarity
   equates to a potential extinction threat for many rare stag beetles
   species.},

Title = {First descriptions of the seasonal habitat use and residency of
   scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and Galapagos sharks (Carcharhinus
   galapagensis) at a coastal seamount off Japan},

Abstract = {Background The Northwestern Pacific is a data-poor region for studies
   into the movements and habitat use of open ocean and pelagic sharks.
   However, this region experiences considerable pressure from commercial
   fishing. Therefore, shark movement data from this region carry
   significant implications for conservation and management, particularly
   for threatened species. Here, we provide the first data on seasonal
   residency and movements of scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and
   Galapagos sharks (Carcharhinus galapagensis), using acoustic and
   satellite telemetry, and dive logbooks, off Japan. Results Eight female
   sharks, four of each species, were tagged around a coastal seamount off
   southeastern Japan (Mikomoto Island) in August 2015, and monitored for a
   period of up to 363 days using an array of six receivers around the
   island. Analyses of the more abundant scalloped hammerhead acoustic data
   suggest high seasonal residency predominantly from August to November
   associated with lower chlorophyll-a concentrations, before sharks then
   leave the island and return the following summer. Residency for
   scalloped hammerhead sharks were highest among those receivers closest
   to the Kuroshio Current, which produces strong coastal upwelling,
   however SST was not found to be predictive of occurrence at Mikomoto.
   Shark presence was corroborated by analysis of dive-log data from a
   local ecotourism operator. We also produced two unique satellite tracks,
   whereby a scalloped hammerhead exhibited a 200-km dispersal into a
   coastal embayment west of the tagging location and a Galapagos shark
   migrated over 800 km offshore into the high seas. Conclusion This study
   provided some of the first behavioral and movement data for scalloped
   hammerhead and Galapagos sharks in Japan. Our findings suggest varying
   spatial and temporal visitation of two shark species to a coastal
   seamount, underscored by some degree of seasonal residency and site
   fidelity and linked, for scalloped hammerhead sharks at least, to
   varying productivity. Furthermore, we provided preliminary evidence for
   long-distance dispersal of these species, and some site fidelity to
   seamounts in the region. This study highlights the importance of
   describing shark movements to aid in filling critical data gaps for
   poorly understood, endemic populations of threatened species.},

Title = {Indicators of ecosystem service potential at European scales: Mapping
   marginal changes and trade-offs},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},

Pages = {39-53},

Abstract = {This study develops an approach to mapping indicators of the potential
   of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services, and the impact of changes in
   land cover and use upon them. The study focuses on the EU-25 plus
   Switzerland and Norway, and develops the methodology proposed by Kienast
   et al. (2009), which uses expert-and literature-driven modelling
   methods. The methods are explored in relation to mapping and assessing
   four of the ecosystem services: ``Crop-based production{''}; ``Wildlife
   products{''}; ``Habitat diversity{''}; and ``Recreation{''}. The
   potential to deliver services is assumed to be influenced by (a)
   land-use, (b) net primary production, and (c) bioclimatic and landscape
   properties such as mountainous terrain, adjacency to coastal and wetland
   ecosystems, as well as adjacency to landscape and nature protection
   zones.
   The novel aspect of this work is an analysis of whether the historical
   and the projected land use changes for the periods 1990-2000,2000-2006,
   and 2000-2030 are likely to be supportive or degenerative in the
   capacity of ecosystems to deliver ecosystem services; we refer to these
   as `marginal' or incremental changes. The latter are assessed by using
   land account data for 1990-2000 and 2000-2006 (LEAC, EEA, 2006) and
   EURURALIS 2.0 land use scenarios for 2000-2030. The results are reported
   at three spatial reporting units, i.e. (1) the NUTS-X regions, (2) the
   bioclimatic regions, and (3) the dominant landscape types. All mapped
   output has been compared with independently generated continent-wide
   assessments (maps of ecosystem services or environmental
   parameters/indicators), which revealed that the straightforward binary
   links work satisfactorily and generate plausible geographical patterns.
   This conclusion mainly holds for provisioning services. At the
   continental scale, the selected input parameters are thus valid proxies
   which can be used to assess the medium-term potential of landscapes to
   provide ecosystem services.
   For a subset of NUTS-x regions for which change trajectories for
   1990-2000,2000-2006 and 2000-2030 are available, trade-offs between the
   four services have been analyzed using cluster analyses. The latter
   allowed us to simultaneously analyze the state of the four services in
   year 2000 and the individual trajectories of each service over three
   time periods. As a result we obtained seven regions with distinct
   trade-off patterns. To our knowledge this is one of the first
   continental-wide analyses where and use trajectories are taken into
   account to construct an indicator to estimate the balance between a set
   or bundle of ecosystem services. The relationship between the outputs of
   this work and the development of rapid assessment and accounting
   frameworks is discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {The unrivaled growth in e-commerce of animals and plants presents an
   unprecedented opportunity to monitor wildlife trade to inform
   conservation, biosecurity, and law enforcement. Using the internet to
   quantify the scale of the wildlife trade (volume and frequency) is a
   relatively recent and rapidly developing approach that lacks an
   accessible framework for locating relevant websites and collecting data.
   We produced an accessible guide for internet-based wildlife trade
   surveillance. We detailed a repeatable method involving a systematic
   internet search, with search engines, to locate relevant websites and
   content. For data collection, we highlight web-scraping technology as an
   efficient way to collect data in an automated fashion at regularly timed
   intervals. Our guide is applicable to the multitude of trade-based
   contexts because researchers can tailor search keywords for specific
   taxa or derived products and locations of interest. We provide
   information for working with the diversity of websites used in wildlife
   trade. For example, to locate relevant content on social media (e.g.,
   posts or groups), each social media platform should be examined
   individually via the site's internal search engine. A key advantage of
   using the internet to study wildlife trade is the relative ease of
   access to an increasing amount of trade-related data. However, not all
   wildlife trade occurs online and it may occur on unobservable sections
   of the internet.},

Title = {Tree species diversity facilitates conservation efforts of European yew},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {791-810},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {European yew (Taxus baccata) is an endangered long-lived tree species.
   The species is facing a regeneration failure in a large part of its
   natural distribution, likely due to interplay of climate change and
   browsing by herbivores. Forest management approaches that support
   inter-specific complementarity can help the species mitigate these
   negative effects. However, a lack of long-term records has prevented an
   adequate answer to the facilitation hypothesis. Therefore, we compiled
   unique data from eleven long-term plots established on three sites in
   the western Carpathian Mountains in 1972, 1989 and 1995. During the past
   30-50years, forest stands were treated by various management
   alternatives, and the development of stands and regeneration were
   monitored in 5-12-year intervals. In this study, we tested the
   hypothesis that an increase in tree species diversity positively
   correlates with abundance of yew regeneration. Additionally, we compared
   the relationships between management and no-management alternatives. Our
   results revealed the positive correlation of tree species diversity and
   the quantity of yew regeneration. Moreover, an increase in the
   proportion of maple seedling at the expense of beech supported the
   establishment of yew seedlings at increased abundance. However, recently
   (since 1982) the growth of yew saplings did not exceed 20cm in height,
   mostly because of heavy damage caused by deer browsing. We conclude that
   forest managers and conservationists can support the regeneration of yew
   using the treatments that increase tree species diversity.},

Abstract = {Management of communities in fragmented systems requires application of
   models for predicting and understanding patterns of diversity at
   relevant scales. Metacommunity models may help explain patterns of
   beta-diversity, but more empirical investigations are needed to
   determine the generality of these models and the importance of matrix
   identity as a mediator of metacommunity processes. We studied patterns
   of beta diversity among cypress domes in a landscape composed of two
   different matrix types within Big Cypress National Preserve to determine
   whether community composition differed by matrix type and to evaluate
   predictions of metacommunity models. We sampled fully-aquatic
   vertebrates in 16 cypress domes. A causal modeling framework was used to
   assess the relative importance of space and environmental variables
   measured in the domes and in the nearby matrix in explaining variation
   in community similarities. Our results show that community composition
   was influenced by matrix type, which violates the common metacommunity
   assumption that matrix identity has negligible effect on patch patterns.
   We found different drivers of beta-diversity patterns between matrix
   types; similarities among dome communities within cypress-prairie matrix
   were influenced by local environmental conditions and matrix
   characteristics, while communities in pine-rockland domes were most
   influenced by conditions in the matrix. Our results have implications
   for use of metacommunity models in conservation planning and we suggest
   that future research should focus on the importance of matrix identity
   and complexity in mediating community patterns in patchy landscapes.},

Abstract = {Tanzania holds most of the remaining large populations of African lions
   (Panthera leo) and has extensive areas of leopard habitat (Panthera
   pardus), and both species are subjected to sizable harvests by sport
   hunters. As a first step toward establishing sustainable management
   strategies, we analyzed harvest trends for lions and leopards across
   Tanzania's 300,000 km2 of hunting blocks. We summarize lion population
   trends in protected areas where lion abundance has been directly
   measured and data on the frequency of lion attacks on humans in
   high-conflict agricultural areas. We place these findings in context of
   the rapidly growing human population in rural Tanzania and the
   concomitant effects of habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and
   cultural practices. Lion harvests declined by 50\% across Tanzania
   between 1996 and 2008, and hunting areas with the highest initial
   harvests suffered the steepest declines. Although each part of the
   country is subject to some form of anthropogenic impact from local
   people, the intensity of trophy hunting was the only significant factor
   in a statistical analysis of lion harvest trends. Although leopard
   harvests were more stable, regions outside the Selous Game Reserve with
   the highest initial leopard harvests again showed the steepest declines.
   Our quantitative analyses suggest that annual hunting quotas be limited
   to 0.5 lions and 1.0 leopard/1000 km2 of hunting area, except hunting
   blocks in the Selous Game Reserve, where harvests should be limited to
   1.0 lion and 3.0 leopards/1000 km2.},

Abstract = {Fostering human-wildlife coexistence requires transdisciplinary
   approaches that integrate multiple sectors, account for complexity and
   uncertainty, and ensure stakeholder participation. One such approach is
   participatory scenario planning, but to date, this approach has not been
   used in human-wildlife contexts. We devised a template for how
   participatory scenario planning can be applied to identify potential
   avenues for improving human-wildlife coexistence. We drew on 3
   conceptual building blocks, namely the SEEDS framework, the notion of
   critical uncertainties, and the three-horizons technique. To illustrate
   the application of the proposed template, we conducted a case study in
   the Zambezi region of Namibia. We held 5 multistakeholder workshops that
   involved local people as well as numerous nongovernment and government
   stakeholders. We identified 14 important wildlife species that generated
   multiple services and disservices. The subsequent benefits and burdens,
   in turn, were inequitably distributed among stakeholders. Government
   actors played particularly influential roles in shaping
   social-ecological outcomes. We identified 2 critical uncertainties for
   the future: the nature of governance (fragmented vs. collaborative) and
   the type of wildlife economy (hunting vs. photography based).
   Considering these uncertainties resulted in 4 plausible scenarios
   describing future human-wildlife coexistence. Stakeholders did not agree
   on a single preferred scenario, but nevertheless agreed on several
   high-priority strategies. Bridging the remaining gaps among actors will
   require ongoing deliberation among stakeholders. Navigating the complex
   challenges posed by living with wildlife requires moving beyond
   disciplinary approaches. To that end, our template could prove useful in
   many landscapes around the world.},

Title = {Spatial risk assessment of eastern monarch butterfly road mortality
   during autumn migration within the southern corridor},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {231},
Pages = {150-160},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Road mortality may contribute to the population decline of eastern
   monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.). We estimated autumn monarch
   roadkill rates within the primary Oklahoma to Mexico southern migration
   corridor (i.e., Central Funnel). Dead monarchs were surveyed along Texas
   roadsides during four weeks of autumn migration in 2016 and 2017.
   Roadkill averaged 3.4 monarchs per 100 m transect, reaching 66 per 100 m
   in a roadkill hotspot in southwestern Texas. Extrapolations of Central
   Funnel roadkill based on survey data and road types were 3.6 and 1.1
   million in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Spatial distribution of roadkill
   across the Central Funnel was projected from Texas survey data using 30
   m resolution MaxEnt niche models. Highest roadkill probability was
   linked to arid climate and low human population density. The latter
   variables may not be directly related to roadkill, but instead represent
   indirect correlates of increased densities of monarchs where the
   migration corridor narrows southwards. The higher roadkill projected in
   southwest Texas and Mexico by MaxEnt models agrees with previously
   reported monarch roadkill hotspots. MaxEnt-based 2016-2017 projections
   for annual roadkill rates throughout the Central Funnel averaged 2.1
   million. This figure is similar to the result by simple extrapolation,
   and represents about 3\% of the overwintering monarch population for
   these years. Mitigation at roadkill hotspots in the Central Funnel could
   reduce monarch roadkill mortality during migration and contribute
   towards conservation efforts for the monarch butterfly.},

Title = {Beyond masking: Endangered Stephen's kangaroo rats respond to traffic
   noise with footdrumming},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {150},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-58},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {On-road vehicles have become a pervasive source of low frequency noise
   in both urban environments and natural protected areas. Because many
   species rely on low-frequency signals to communicate with conspecifics,
   they are likely to be especially vulnerable to signal masking and the
   concomitant biological effects associated with exposure to traffic
   noise. Here, we show that the spectral characteristics of traffic noise
   overlap extensively with footdrumming signals of the endangered
   Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi; SKR). Playbacks of
   footdrumming overlaid with experimental and control background noises
   indicate that traffic noise masks and may mimic footdrumming signals.
   SKR showed no response to footdrumming playbacks overlaid with traffic
   noise. Yet, traffic noise itself may mimic footdrumming and prompt a
   false response in SKR - playbacks of traffic noise alone and
   footdrumming overlaid with control sounds elicited similar behavioral
   responses. These results provide the first evidence that anthropogenic
   noise may function as a deceptive signal to wildlife, causing animals to
   engage in false responses that may be energetically and biologically
   costly. More broadly, these results indicate that anthropogenic noise
   can have multiple, concurrent effects. For SKR, the combined effects of
   communication disruption and signal deception may further tax already
   endangered populations. Roads and road margins on and off reserves serve
   as dispersal corridors and refugia for SKR and other semifossorial taxa:
   these areas may therefore function as ecological traps if anthropogenic
   roadway noise negatively affects population persistence. (C) 2012

Title = {Allee Effect and the Uncertainty of Population Recovery},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {790-798},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recovery of depleted populations is fundamentally important for
   conservation biology and sustainable resource harvesting. At low
   abundance, population growth rate, a primary determinant of population
   recovery, is generally assumed to be relatively fast because competition
   is low (i.e., negative density dependence). But population growth can be
   limited in small populations by an Allee effect. This is particularly
   relevant for collapsed populations or species that have not recovered
   despite large reductions in, or elimination of, threats. We investigated
   how an Allee effect can influence the dynamics of recovery. We used
   Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) as the study organism and an empirically
   quantified Allee effect for the species to parameterize our simulations.
   We simulated recovery through an individual-based mechanistic simulation
   model and then compared recovery among scenarios incorporating an Allee
   effect, negative density dependence, and an intermediate scenario.
   Although an Allee effect significantly slowed recovery, such that
   population increase could be negligible even after 100 years or more, it
   also made the time required for biomass rebuilding much less
   predictable. Our finding that an Allee effect greatly increased the
   uncertainty in recovery time frames provides an empirically based
   explanation for why the removal of threat does not always result in the
   recovery of depleted populations or species. El Efecto Allee y la
   Incertidumbre de la Recuperacion de Poblaciones
   Resumen La recuperacion de las poblaciones disminuidas es
   fundamentalmente importante para la biologia de la conservacion y la
   cosecha sustentable de recursos. Con poca abundancia, generalmente se
   asume que la tasa de crecimiento poblacional, un determinante primario
   de la recuperacion de poblaciones, es relativamente rapida porque la
   competencia es baja (p. ej.: dependencia de densidad negativa) pero el
   crecimiento poblacional puede estar limitado por el efecto Allee en
   poblaciones pequenas. Esto es particularmente relevante para las
   poblaciones o especies colapsadas que no se han recuperado a pesar de
   grandes reducciones en, o la eliminacion de, las amenazas. Investigamos
   como el efecto Allee puede influenciar las dinamicas de recuperacion.
   Usamos al bacalao del Atlantico (Gadus morhua) como organismo de estudio
   y un efecto Allee para las especies cuantificado empiricamente para
   hacer parametros en nuestras simulaciones. Simulamos la recuperacion por
   medio de un modelo de simulacion mecanicista basado en un individuo y
   despues comparamos la recuperacion entre escenarios incorporando un
   efecto Allee, dependencia de densidad negativa y un escenario
   intermedio. Aunque el efecto Allee hizo significativamente mas lenta la
   recuperacion, tal incremento en la poblacion puede ser despreciable
   incluso despues de 100 anos o mas; tambien hizo que el tiempo requerido
   para la reconstruccion de la biomasa fuera mucho menos predecible.
   Nuestro descubrimiento de que el efecto Allee incrementa mucho la
   incertidumbre en los marcos de tiempo de la recuperacion proporciona una
   explicacion con base empirica de por que la remocion de la amenaza no
   siempre resulta en la recuperacion de poblaciones o especies
   empobrecidas.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},

Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Coatis (Nasua narica) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) potentially play an
   important role in zoonotic diseases because they may carry pathogens and
   can transmit them to humans. To date, our understanding of the immune
   function of these two carnivores is deficient. The aim of this study was
   to compare the number of leucocyte subtypes and the phagocytic capacity
   between the coati and the raccoon. Blood samples were collected, and
   leucocyte subtypes were characterized and counted by flow cytometry and
   microscopy, respectively. Phagocytosis was analysed by kinetic assay.
   Differences in leucocytes between these two species were found; the
   total count of neutrophils was higher in raccoons than in coatis, but
   lymphocytes and eosinophils were higher in coatis than in raccoons.
   Antigen reduction was more rapid for the coatis. However, raccoons had a
   higher efficient endocytic process than coatis. This study provides the
   basis for understanding the procyonid immune system, which informs
   conservation, particularly since some procyonids are imperilled.},

Title = {New social trails made during the pandemic increase fragmentation of an
   urban protected area},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {255},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Urban protected areas are an important resource to people and wildlife,
   providing many ecosystem services. During the initial phase of the
   COVID-19 pandemic lockdown during March?June 2020, there was a major
   increase in the number of hikers and bicyclists in urban protected
   areas, including the Webster Woods in Newton, Massachusetts (USA), an
   82.5-ha protected area. The Webster Woods is one of the largest
   protected areas near the center of Boston and is widely used in
   conservation textbooks as an example of the effects of habitat
   fragmentation on the amount of undisturbed habitat. Prior to the
   pandemic, the Webster Woods had been extensively fragmented by paved
   roads, dirt roads, and trails, with little interior habitat remaining.
   During the first four months of the pandemic, hikers and bicyclists made
   4.9 km of new social (or informal) trails, an increase of 36\%. This
   recent fragmentation represents a dramatic increase in the level of
   human impact on the area, reducing the amount of interior habitat from
   3.2 to 2.1 ha. Levels of human activity returned to pre-pandemic levels
   in autumn 2020 and city officials have started closing access to some of
   the new trails, allowing vegetation to regrow. It is possible that
   similar increases in social trails and associated fragmentation have
   occurred in other protected areas (especially those in urban areas)
   around the world due to the pandemic, and these disturbances should be
   evaluated for their effects on plant and animal populations.},

Abstract = {Indian Himalayan basins are earmarked for widespread dam building, but
   aggregate effects of these dams on terrestrial ecosystems are unknown.
   We mapped distribution of 292 dams (under construction and proposed) and
   projected effects of these dams on terrestrial ecosystems under
   different scenarios of land-cover loss. We analyzed land-cover data of
   the Himalayan valleys, where dams are located. We estimated dam density
   on fifth-through seventh-order rivers and compared these estimates with
   current global figures. We used a species-area relation model (SAR) to
   predict short-and long-term species extinctions driven by deforestation.
   We used scatter plots and correlation studies to analyze distribution
   patterns of species and dams and to reveal potential overlap between
   species-rich areas and dam sites. We investigated effects of disturbance
   on community structure of undisturbed forests. Nearly 90\% of Indian
   Himalayan valleys would be affected by dam building and 27\% of these
   dams would affect dense forests. Our model projected that 54,117 ha of
   forests would be submerged and 114,361 ha would be damaged by
   dam-related activities. A dam density of 0.3247/1000 km(2) would be
   nearly 62 times greater than current average global figures; the average
   of 1 dam for every 32 km of river channel would be 1.5 times higher than
   figures reported for U. S. rivers. Our results show that most dams would
   be located in species-rich areas of the Himalaya. The SAR model
   projected that by 2025, deforestation due to dam building would likely
   result in extinction of 22 angiosperm and 7 vertebrate taxa. Disturbance
   due to dam building would likely reduce tree species richness by 35\%,
   tree density by 42\%, and tree basal cover by 30\% in dense forests.
   These results, combined with relatively weak national environmental
   impact assessment and implementation, point toward significant loss of
   species if all proposed dams in the Indian Himalaya are constructed.},

Title = {To catch or to sight? A comparison of demographic parameter estimates
   obtained from mark-recapture and mark-resight models},

Abstract = {Accurate assessments of population parameters, such as survival and
   abundance, are critical for effective wildlife conservation. In order
   for wildlife managers to undertake long-term monitoring of populations,
   the data collection must be as cost-effective as possible. Two
   demographic modelling techniques commonly used are mark-recapture and
   mark-resight. Mark-resight can be used in conjunction with biotelemetry
   methods and offers a more cost effective alternative to the traditional
   mark-recapture models. However, there has been no empirical comparison
   of the demographic parameters obtained from the two modelling
   techniques. This study used photographs of natural markings to
   individually identify wobbegong sharks (Orectolobus maculatus) sighted
   during underwater surveys over a 2 year period, during eight distinct
   sampling periods, and analysed with Pollock's robust design
   mark-recapture models. These estimates were then compared, using z
   tests, with Poisson-lognormal mark-resight models that used resightings
   of sharks previously tagged with telemetry transmitters, and the
   telemetry data to calculate the number of marked animals present in each
   sampling period. Sharks were categorised into four groups according to
   their sex and age-class (adult/juvenile). The results indicated that
   there was a high degree of transience in the population, with 62 \% of
   sharks only being sighted in one sampling period. Based on normalized
   Akaike weights, there was no single `best' model for either type of
   modelling technique and model averaging was used to determine the
   demographic estimates. Both models showed higher abundance of wobbegongs
   in the austral spring and summer seasons, however, the models produced
   statistically different results for five of the eight sampling periods.
   The mark-recapture model estimated apparent survival between 78 and 95
   \%, whereas the mark-resight models estimated it between 48 and 97 \%.
   Crucially, there was no statistical difference between the survival
   estimates from corresponding sex/age-class. The temporary emigration
   parameters differed substantially between the model types. The
   mark-recapture model showed support for Markovian movement, whereas the
   mark-resight supported random emigration. The timing of the tagging
   events likely biased the abundance and temporary emigration parameters
   estimated by mark-resight models and must be taken into consideration
   when designing a mark-resight study. Despite this, this study shows that
   robust demographic estimates, that are comparable to labour intensive
   mark-recapture estimates, can still be obtained using mark-resight
   methods. Given the substantial increase in biotelemetry studies of
   medium and large sized vertebrates, mark-resight models may play an
   important future role in estimating demographic parameters.},

Abstract = {Decisions concerning the appropriate listing status of species under the
   U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) can be controversial even among
   conservationists. These decisions may determine whether a species
   persists in the near term and have long-lasting social and political
   ramifications. Given the ESA's mandate that such decisions be based on
   the best available science, it is important to examine what factors
   contribute to experts' judgments concerning the listing of species. We
   examined how a variety of factors (such as risk perception, value
   orientations, and norms) influenced experts' judgments concerning the
   appropriate listing status of the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis)
   population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Experts were invited to
   complete an online survey examining their perceptions of the threats
   grizzly bears face and their listing recommendation. Although experts'
   assessments of the threats to this species were strongly correlated with
   their recommendations for listing status, this relationship did not
   exist when other cognitive factors were included in the model.
   Specifically, values related to human use of wildlife and norms (i.e., a
   respondent's expectation of peers' assessments) were most influential in
   listing status recommendations. These results suggest that experts'
   decisions about listing, like all human decisions, are subject to the
   use of heuristics (i.e., decision shortcuts). An understanding of how
   heuristics and related biases affect decisions under uncertainty can
   help inform decision making about threatened and endangered species and
   may be useful in designing effective processes for protection of
   imperiled species.},

Volume = {166},

Abstract = {In order to reverse the decline of imperilled species, we need to know
   what is threatening their survival. Canada's Species at Risk Act (SARA)
   is intended to provide for the protection and recovery of species listed
   under the Act. Threats to SARA-listed species must be documented in
   recovery strategies, which also define recovery goals and critical
   habitat. We reviewed finalized recovery strategies for 146 species to
   determine the major threats to these species and whether designation of
   critical habitat or the relative ambition of recovery goals is
   associated with the nature of threats. We then compared our findings to
   the threats described in reports prepared by the Committee on the Status
   of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), the independent body which
   prepares status reports for all imperilled species (including those not
   listed under SARA). Human disturbance, in particular due to recreation,
   was the most frequently listed threat in recovery strategies, followed
   by invasive species and residential and commercial development. Threats
   differed among taxonomic groups and broad habitat types, but there was
   no evidence that low ambition of recovery goals or failure to designate
   critical habitat were correlated with particular threats. However,
   species with certain threats, including biological resource use, were
   less likely either to be listed under SARA and/or to have a finalized
   recovery strategy once listed. Documenting threat-based differences in
   the recovery process is an important first step toward ensuring that
   SARA results in timely and effective measures to recover all listed
   species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Disease induced changes in gene flow patterns among Tasmanian devil
   populations},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {165},
Pages = {69-78},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Infectious diseases of wildlife reduce population size and may erode
   genetic diversity, constituting an extinction threat. The Tasmanian
   devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is threatened with extinction by an
   infectious cancer, the devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). In less than
   two decades, DFTD has caused a more than 85\% overall population
   decline. We used ten polymorphic microsatellite loci to quantify the
   effects of this decline on genetic diversity, population
   differentiation, effective population size, and gene flow. Samples from
   1999 and 2006 at five locations were analysed, three of which had been
   affected by DFTD during this time interval. Significant increases in
   inbreeding coefficient (f) and non-significant reductions in effective
   population size were observed for both diseased and non-diseased
   populations, and therefore there was no consistent effect of DFTD. There
   was significant but stable structuring of genetic variation among
   locations through time, although a dynamic ``source-sink{''}
   relationship was evident for gene flow associated with disease-mediated
   changes in population densities. These changes in gene flow may have
   contributed to the maintenance of genetic diversity in disease-affected
   areas. Simulations suggest that the estimated population declines,
   although severe, have been insufficient to yield significant changes in
   genetic variation; this may have been exacerbated by disequilibrium
   between population sizes and genetic diversity at the time of DFTD
   emergence, owing to elevated devil abundances following the extinction
   of the previous apex predator-the thylacine-approximately 80 years ago.

Title = {Compensation payments, procedures and policies towards human-wildlife
   conflict management: Insights from India},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {227},
Pages = {383-389},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The effectiveness of compensation payments in mitigating and resolving
   human-wildlife conflict is globally debated. We examined procedures,
   types, and payments made for incidents reported in India from 2010 to
   2015. Among India's 29 states, 22 (76\%) compensated for crop loss, 18
   (62\%) for property damage, 26 (90\%) for livestock depredation, and 28
   (97\%) for human injury or death. In 2012-2013, a total of 78,656
   conflict incidents were reported from 18 states with complete data. Of
   these incidents, 73.4\% were crop loss and property damage, 20\%
   livestock predation, 6.2\% human injury, and 0.4\% human death. In
   2012-2013, payments totalled \$5,332,762 (ranging from \$0 for no
   reported incidents in Tripura to \$1,956,115 for 36,091 incidents in
   Karnataka). The average expenditures per incident were \$47 for crop and
   property damage, \$74 for livestock, \$103 for human injury and \$3224
   for human death. These numbers underestimate the total extent of
   conflict because of low reporting rates and unavailability of complete
   records from all states. We found a lack of policies in some states,
   while others have low payment amounts along with high transaction costs.
   Despite a significant Indian government mandate supporting compensation
   payments in India, there exist inconsistencies in eligibility,
   application, assessment, implementation, and payment procedures across
   states. Ensuring that compensation reaches all affected people requires
   standardizing these processes in a transparent and efficient manner,
   while also monitoring its perceived benefits to wildlife conservation.},

Title = {The problem of estimating recent genetic connectivity in a changing

Abstract = {Accurate understanding of population connectivity is important to
   conservation because dispersal can play an important role in population
   dynamics, microevolution, and assessments of extirpation risk and
   population rescue. Genetic methods are increasingly used to infer
   population connectivity because advances in technology have made them
   more advantageous (e.g., cost effective) relative to ecological methods.
   Given the reductions in wildlife population connectivity since the
   Industrial Revolution and more recent drastic reductions from habitat
   loss, it is important to know the accuracy of and biases in genetic
   connectivity estimators when connectivity has declined recently. Using
   simulated data, we investigated the accuracy and bias of 2 common
   estimators of migration (movement of individuals among populations)
   rate. We focused on the timing of the connectivity change and the
   magnitude of that change on the estimates of migration by using a
   coalescent-based method (Migrate-n) and a disequilibrium-based method
   (BayesAss). Contrary to expectations, when historically high
   connectivity had declined recently: (i) both methods over-estimated
   recent migration rates; (ii) the coalescent-based method (Migrate-n)
   provided better estimates of recent migration rate than the
   disequilibrium-based method (BayesAss); (iii) the coalescent-based
   method did not accurately reflect long-term genetic connectivity.
   Overall, our results highlight the problems with comparing coalescent
   and disequilibrium estimates to make inferences about the effects of
   recent landscape change on genetic connectivity among populations. We
   found that contrasting these 2 estimates to make inferences about
   genetic-connectivity changes over time could lead to inaccurate
   conclusions.},

Title = {When good animals love restored habitat in bad neighborhoods: ecological
   traps for eastern cottontails in agricultural landscapes},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {953-973},

Abstract = {Large-scale restoration programs have been implemented worldwide to
   counteract habitat loss and fragmentation from expansion and
   intensification of agriculture. These agri-environment programs create
   habitat patches imbedded in an agricultural matrix. The assumption is
   these patches benefit wildlife and that individuals either avoid
   agricultural fields or use them to increase their fitness. We selected
   eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus) as a focal species on
   restored grasslands in Illinois, USA to assess survival and to determine
   if maladaptive habitat selection for agricultural fields could create an
   ecological trap. We also investigated whether a mismatch between real
   and perceived predation risk could explain their habitat selection. We
   radiotracked 95 cottontails and estimated habitat-specific survival
   using known-fate models, and measured habitat selection using Manly's
   standardized selection ratios. We also assessed perceived predation risk
   with giving-up density experiments. Survival of cottontails was higher
   in restored grasslands relative to agricultural and developed areas.
   Habitat selection did not reflect this spatial variation in mortality
   risk, however, when crops were present on the landscape. Agricultural
   lands created an equal-preference trap. Cottontails did not accurately
   assess predation risk; they did not recognize that agricultural fields
   were risky. This mismatch could be due to cottontails' emphasis on
   protecting themselves from avian predators rather than from coyotes
   (Canis latrans), which currently are their main predator. Our novel
   study demonstrates how dynamic landscape context can create ecological
   traps. Such unexpected outcomes can reduce the conservation benefits of
   restoration programs.},

Title = {Ecological tradeoffs in non-native plant management},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {159},
Pages = {292-302},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Controlling non-native plants in natural areas should, ideally, not only
   reduce target species' abundance, but also benefit broader management
   objectives such as conserving native species, improving wildlife
   habitat, and maintaining ecosystem function. In this context, the
   effectiveness and non-target impacts of control strategies, such as
   broadleaf herbicides, must be weighed against the impacts of non-native
   plants themselves. We undertook this relative assessment for Centaurea
   stoebe, one of the most widespread and heavily managed non-native plant
   species in the Intermountain West, USA. While effectiveness and plant
   community impacts of herbicide treatment for C. stoebe have been
   assessed, field-based experiments quantifying community-level impacts of
   C stoebe are rare. In a three-year experiment in sagebrush-grassland
   communities of southwest Montana, USA, we found that the broadleaf
   herbicide, picloram, was highly effective at reducing C stoebe, but also
   caused a significant loss of native forb cover and a significant
   increase in non-native grass cover, primarily Bromus tectorum. There was
   a significant increase in native forb cover in response to manual
   removal of C stoebe, which would seem to indicate C stoebe had been
   suppressing native forbs. However, there was an equivalent increase in
   native forb cover with no treatment. In some communities, C stoebe
   appears to have a negligible effect on native forb and grass cover and
   richness. Depending on management objectives, the loss of native forb
   cover and potential secondary invasion may outweigh the benefits of
   reduced target non-native plant abundance; thus, highlighting an
   ecological tradeoff of non-native plant management in natural areas. (C)

Title = {Prolonged drought results in starvation of African elephant (Loxodonta
   africana)},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {203},
Pages = {89-96},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Elephant inhabiting arid and semi-arid savannas often experience periods
   of drought, which, if prolonged, may cause mortality. During dry
   periods, elephant aggregate around water sources and deplete local
   forage availability. However, the relationships between adult elephant
   mortality and both high local elephant density and forage availability
   close to water during dry periods remain unexplored. We hypothesized
   that elephant mortality is higher: a) when dry periods are longer, b)
   closer to water points, and c) in areas with higher local elephant
   density. Using nine years of elephant carcass data from Tsavo
   Conservation Area in Kenya, we analysed the probability of adult
   elephant mortality using maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt). We found
   that elephant carcasses were aggregated and elephant mortality was
   negatively correlated with four months cumulative precipitation prior to
   death (which contributed 41\% to the model), Normalised Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) (19\%) and distance to water (6\%), while local
   elephant density (19\%) showed a positive correlation. Three seasons
   (long dry, short dry and short wet seasons) showed high probability of
   elephant mortality, whereas low probability was found during long wet
   seasons. Our results strongly suggest that elephants starve to death in
   prolonged drought. Artificial water holes may lead to lower mortality,
   but also to larger populations with subsequent high browsing pressure on
   the vegetation. Our results suggest that elephant populations in arid
   and semi-arid savannas appear to be regulated by drought-induced
   mortalities, which may be the best way of controlling elephant numbers
   without having to cull. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Evaluating the effectiveness of road mitigation measures},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {425-448},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The last 20 years have seen a dramatic increase in efforts to mitigate
   the negative effects of roads and traffic on wildlife, including fencing
   to prevent wildlife-vehicle collisions and wildlife crossing structures
   to facilitate landscape connectivity. While not necessarily explicitly
   articulated, the fundamental drivers behind road mitigation are human
   safety, animal welfare, and/or wildlife conservation. Concomitant with
   the increased effort to mitigate has been a focus on evaluating road
   mitigation. So far, research has mainly focussed on assessing the use of
   wildlife crossing structures, demonstrating that a broad range of
   species use them. However, this research has done little to address the
   question of the effectiveness of crossing structures, because use of a
   wildlife crossing structure does not necessarily equate to its
   effectiveness. The paucity of studies directly examining the
   effectiveness of crossing structures is exacerbated by the fact that
   such studies are often poorly designed, which limits the level of
   inference that can be made. Without well performed evaluations of the
   effectiveness of road mitigation measures, we may endanger the viability
   of wildlife populations and inefficiently use financial resources by
   installing structures that are not as effective as we think they are. In
   this paper we outline the essential elements of a good experimental
   design for such assessments and prioritize the parameters to be
   measured. The framework we propose will facilitate collaboration between
   road agencies and scientists to undertake research programs that fully
   evaluate effectiveness of road mitigation measures. We discuss the added
   value of road mitigation evaluations for policy makers and
   transportation agencies and provide recommendations on how to
   incorporate such evaluations in road planning practices.},

Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflicts like wildlife-vehicle collisions pose major
   challenges for the management and conservation of mobile wildlife in
   human-dominated landscapes, particularly when large species are
   involved. Mitigation measures to reduce risk of collisions may be based
   on information given by wildlife movement and collision data. To test
   whether movement and collision data indicate different spatiotemporal
   risk zones, we predicted year-around probabilities of road-crossings of
   GPS-marked female moose (Alces alces) (n = 102), and compared them with
   spatiotemporal patterns of police recorded moose-vehicle collisions (n =
   1158). Probability of moose road-crossings peaked in May, June, and
   between mid November and the beginning of January, i.e. during moose
   migration. Moose-vehicle collisions were more likely during autumn and
   winter. Comparing environmental attributes of crossing and collision
   sites showed significant differences. The likelihood of collisions
   increased with the abundance of human-modified areas and higher allowed
   speed, and was lower on forest roads. We found that animal movement data
   alone are insufficient to predict collision risk zones, while analyses
   of collision data alone overestimate the collision risk in certain
   habitats. Our findings suggest that higher collision risk is largely due
   to low light and poor road surface conditions rather than to more animal
   road-crossings. This suggests that efforts to reduce wildlife collisions
   should focus on driver attitudes and road conditions rather than animal
   movement, and any efforts to model the collision risk will require
   actual collision data, and not just movement data. (c) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {Habitat selection of a large carnivore, the red wolf, in a human-altered
   landscape},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {324-330},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Large carnivores, with their expansive home range and resource
   requirements, are a good model for understanding how animal populations
   alter habitat selection and use as human densities and development
   increase. We examined the habitat selection of red wolves (Canis rufus)
   in North Carolina, USA, where the population of red wolves resides in a
   mosaic of naturally occurring and human-associated land cover. We used
   locations from 20 GPS-collared red wolves, monitored over 3 years, to
   develop resource selection functions at the landscape level. Red wolves
   selected for human-associated land-cover over other land-cover types.
   Red wolves also selected areas near secondary roads. However, red wolves
   avoided areas with high human density, and avoidance of natural
   land-cover types decreased as human density increased; this interaction
   was strong enough that red wolves selected for natural land-cover types
   over human-associated land-cover types at relatively high human density.
   Similarly, avoidance of natural land-cover types decreased when they
   were near secondary roads. These results suggest that red wolves will
   use human-associated landscapes, but modify their habitat selection
   patterns with increased human presence. Such findings suggest that large
   carnivores such as the red wolf may not strictly require habitats devoid
   of humans. In a world with rapid human-alteration of habitat,
   understanding how increasing human density and development impact
   habitat selection is vital to managing for population persistence of
   large carnivores and maintaining top-down ecological processes. (C) 2012

Title = {Streamlining Disease Risk Analysis for Wildlife Using the Shark Bay
   Bandicoot as a Model},
Journal = {ECOHEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-30},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Disease risk analysis (DRA) is a process for identifying significant
   disease risks and proposing measures to mitigate those risks. Although
   numerous methodologies for DRA exist, the IUCN Disease Risk Analysis
   Manual Jakob-Hoff et al. (World Organisation for Animal Health, Paris,
   pp 160, 2014) remains the gold standard for wild animal translocations.
   In some cases, however, constraints of time or resources demand
   compromises on the ideal methodology, and a cost-benefit assessment is
   required to determine the best approach. We propose a methodology
   modified from Jakob-Hoff et al. (World Organisation for Animal Health,
   Paris, pp 160, 2014) and Sainsbury and Vaughan-Higgins (Conserv Biol
   26:442-452, 2012), using translocations of the Shark Bay bandicoot (SBB)
   (Perameles bougainville) as an example. In this study, 44 hazards were
   identified and described for Peramelidae species. We used hazard
   prioritization and ``scoping{''} to develop a shortlist of hazards for
   detailed risk assessment, which excluded 35 of these hazards from
   further assessment. This approach enabled timely, efficient and
   cost-effective completion of the DRA while maintaining transparent
   evaluation of all disease risks. We developed a disease risk management
   strategy for SBB based on structured, evidence-based analysis of current
   information and established biosecurity practices and disease screening
   recommendations for future translocations. Our approach demonstrates a
   practical process for DRA and risk mitigation, which delivered
   management outcomes despite limited resources, variable knowledge of
   disease epidemiology and uncertain translocation pathways for the target
   species. Limitations are acknowledged, and further research will aim to
   objectively test this methodology compared to other available methods.},

Title = {Ecological consequences of forest elephant declines for Afrotropical
   forests},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {559-567},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Poaching is rapidly extirpating African forest elephants (Loxodonta
   cyclotis) from most of their historical range, leaving vast areas of
   elephant-free tropical forest. Elephants are ecological engineers that
   create and maintain forest habitat; thus, their loss will have large
   consequences for the composition and structure of Afrotropical forests.
   Through a comprehensive literature review, we evaluated the roles of
   forest elephants in seed dispersal, nutrient recycling, and herbivory
   and physical damage to predict the cascading ecological effects of their
   population declines. Loss of seed dispersal by elephants will favor tree
   species dispersed abiotically and by smaller dispersal agents, and tree
   species composition will depend on the downstream effects of changes in
   elephant nutrient cycling and browsing. Loss of trampling and herbivory
   of seedlings and saplings will result in high tree density with release
   from browsing pressures. Diminished seed dispersal by elephants and high
   stem density are likely to reduce the recruitment of large trees and
   thus increase homogeneity of forest structure and decrease carbon
   stocks. The loss of ecological services by forest elephants likely means
   Central African forests will be more like Neotropical forests, from
   which megafauna were extirpated thousands of years ago. Without
   intervention, as much as 96\% of Central African forests will have
   modified species composition and structure as elephants are compressed
   into remaining protected areas. Stopping elephant poaching is an urgent
   first step to mitigating these effects, but long-term conservation will
   require land-use planning that incorporates elephant habitat into
   forested landscapes that are being rapidly transformed by industrial
   agriculture and logging.},

Title = {Quantifying microbe transmission networks for wild and domestic
   ungulates in Kenya},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {136-146},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Multi-host wildlife pathogens are an increasing concern for both
   wildlife conservation and livestock husbandry. Here, we combined social
   network theory with microbial genetics to assess patterns of
   interspecific pathogen transmission among ten species of wild and
   domestic ungulates in Kenya. If two individuals shared the same genetic
   subtype of a genetically diverse microbe, Escherichia coli, then we
   inferred that these individuals were part of the same transmission
   chain. Individuals in the same transmission chain were interlinked to
   create a transmission network. Given interspecific variation in
   physiology and behavior, some species may function as
   ``super-spreaders{''} if individuals of that species are consistently
   central in the transmission network. Pathogen management strategies
   targeted at key super-spreader species are theoretically more effective
   at limiting pathogen spread than conventional strategies, and our
   approach provides a means to identify candidate super-spreaders in wild
   populations. We found that Grant's gazelle (Gazella granti) typically
   occupied central network positions and were connected to a large number
   of other individuals in the network. Zebra (Equus burchelli), in
   contrast, seemed to function as bridges between regions of the network
   that would otherwise be poorly connected, and interventions targeted at
   zebra significantly increased the level of fragmentation in the network.
   Although not usually pathogenic, E. coli transmission pathways provide
   insight into transmission dynamics by demonstrating where contact
   between species is sufficient for transmission to occur and identifying
   species that are potential super-spreaders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Why did the elephant cross the road? The complex response of wild
   elephants to a major road in Peninsular Malaysia},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {218},
Pages = {91-98},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Roads cause negative impacts on wildlife by directly and indirectly
   facilitating habitat destruction and wildlife mortality. We used GPS
   telemetry to study the movements of 17 wild Asian elephants (Elephas
   maximus) and a mechanistic modelling framework to analyse elephant
   response to a road bisecting their habitat in Belum-Temengor, northern
   Peninsular Malaysia. Our objectives were to (1) describe patterns of
   road crossing, (2) quantify road effects on movement patterns and
   habitat preference, and (3) quantify individual variation in elephant
   responses to the road. Elephants crossed the road on average 3.9 +/- 0.6
   times a month, mostly (81\% of times) at night, and crossing was not
   evenly distributed in space. The road caused a strong and consistent
   barrier effect for elephants, reducing permeability an average of
   79.5\%. Elephants, however, were attracted to the proximity to the road,
   where secondary forest and open habitats are more abundant and contain
   more food resources for elephants. Although the road acts as a strong
   barrier to movement (a direct effect), local changes to vegetation
   communities near roads attract elephants (an indirect effect). Given
   that risk of mortality (from poaching and vehicle collisions) increases
   near roads, roads may, therefore, create attractive sinks for elephants.
   To mitigate the impact of this road we recommend avoiding further road
   expansion, reducing and enforcing speed limits, limiting traffic volume
   at night, managing habitat near the road and, importantly, enhancing
   patrolling and other anti-poaching efforts. Our results are relevant for
   landscapes throughout Asia and Africa, where existing or planned roads
   fragment elephant habitats.},

Title = {Effects of roads and roadside fencing on movements, space use, and
   carapace temperatures of a threatened tortoise},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {214},
Pages = {13-22},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Roads are widespread features of many landscapes that can negatively
   affect wildlife, most notably through animal-vehicle collisions.
   Roadside fencing has increasingly been installed to help eliminate this
   source of mortality. While fencing may reduce road mortality, other
   types of wildlife responses to this novel barrier are not well
   understood. Here, we examined the movement behavior, space use, and
   carapace temperatures of Mojave Desert Tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) as
   they interacted with a roadside fence and an unfenced road. Using GPS
   loggers, we tracked tortoise movements for two years at 15-min
   intervals. We found that carapace temperatures were greater near
   structures (fence or unfenced road) than away from structures; tortoises
   near the unfenced road had higher mean carapace temperatures, but
   tortoises along the fence experienced more extreme upper temperatures
   that approached the species' thermal limit. Movement speeds were also
   higher along the structures than away from them. Tortoise home range
   sizes decreased with proximity to the fence or road; fragmentation of
   home ranges and road-crossing avoidance may have contributed to smaller
   home ranges along the fenced and unfenced road, respectively. While
   tortoises crossed the road significantly less than expected by chance,
   they did so primarily in May and July and in areas with washes,
   indicating that placement of roadside fencing and animal underpasses
   could be optimized by targeting areas where roads intersect washes.
   Taken together, our results suggest that roadside fencing can affect
   behavior, space use, and thermal ecology of tortoises, which may require
   refinements to future conservation strategies involving roadside
   fencing.},

Title = {Integrating harvest and camera trap data in species distribution models},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {258},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Wildlife managers need reliable information on species distributions
   (i.e. patterns of occurrence and abundance) to make effective decisions.
   Historically, managers have relied on harvest records (collected at
   broad spatial extents but coarse resolution) to monitor wildlife
   populations. However, emerging citizen-science datastreams can
   potentially supplement harvest-based monitoring by providing
   fine-resolution data that permit identification of species-environment
   relationships needed to predict occurrence and abundance. We combined
   harvest records and citizen-science camera-trap data in integrated
   species distribution models (iSDMs) to estimate speciesenvironment
   relationships and distribution patterns of six wildlife species in
   Wisconsin, USA. We expected that iSDMs would more precisely estimate
   species-environment relationships and predict spatial abundance patterns
   intermediate between camera- and harvest-only SDMs. We also conducted
   simulations to explore the consequences of incomplete knowledge of
   harvest effort for estimates of abundance and species-environment
   relationships. Integrated models produced more precise
   species-environment relationships than camera-only models in 53\% of the
   relationships we tested; all harvest-only models failed to converge.
   Moreover, integrated and camera-only models showed low agreement (mean:
   19.67\%) in identifying abundance ``hotspots{''} but considerably higher
   agreement (mean: 45.17\%) in identifying abundance ``cold spots{''}. Our
   simulations showed that abundance patterns estimated by iSDMs may suffer
   from imprecision if harvest effort is poorly measured. We recommend that
   harvest records be collected at finer spatial resolutions and be paired
   with in-depth effort reporting. Our work demonstrates the potential for
   integrating an existing datastream (harvest records) with an emerging
   one (citizen-science camera-trap monitoring) for modeling species
   distributions and providing support for wildlife management decisions.},

Title = {Human-snow leopard conflict in the Chang Tang region of Tibet, China},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {237},
Pages = {504-513},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In April 2006, the authors conducted a preliminary human-wildlife
   conflict survey of 300 livestock herders in Shainza, Nyima, and Tsonyi
   Counties in northern Tibet's sparsely-populated Chang Tang region. This
   survey revealed a widespread but previously undocumented problem of snow
   leopard predation on livestock. In June and July 2007, an exploratory
   human-snow leopard conflict survey of 234 herders in the above counties
   found that 65.8\% of respondents had experienced conflict with snow
   leopards in the form of livestock kills, with 77.3\% of the most recent
   incidents occurring in the previous five years. These incidents were
   concentrated in winter and spring and a surprising 39.6\% of incidents
   occurred during the day, often with herders present. Fifteen exploratory
   snow leopard sign transects totaling 14.85 km were conducted. Abundant
   snow leopard scrapes as well as pug marks were found, confirming the
   presence of these secretive cats. A total of 521 blue sheep were counted
   on and off sign transects indicating widespread availability of wild
   snow leopard prey. The recent surge in reported snow leopard conflict is
   likely due to increasing human and livestock populations, establishment
   of two multiple-use nature reserves accompanied by improved enforcement
   of wildlife protection laws, and a regional gun and trap ban launched in
   2001. However, retaliatory killing of snow leopards in the survey area
   continues to be a potential threat. Therefore, measures are needed to
   reduce livestock kills by snow leopards, including corral improvements,
   improved guarding, establishment of livestock compensation schemes, and
   educating herders about snow leopard behavior.},

Title = {Detecting declines of apex carnivores and evaluating their causes: An
   example with Zambian lions},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {180},
Pages = {176-186},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Large carnivores are in rapid global decline, with a broad array of
   consequences for the ecosystems they inhabit. To efficiently detect and
   address these declines requires unbiased and precise demographic data.
   Unfortunately, the characteristics that make large carnivores
   extinction-prone also pose serious challenges to obtaining these data.
   Rapid survey methods exist, but provide only relative measures of
   abundance, cannot detect declines before they become large, and provide
   little or no information about the causes of decline. African lions
   (Panthera leo) are declining throughout their range, making accurate
   monitoring of remaining populations urgent. We provide statistically
   rigorous estimates of population size, trends, survival rate and age-sex
   structure from Zambia's South Luangwa lion population from 2008 to 2012,
   just prior to cessation of hunting in 2013. Mark-recapture models fit to
   data from intensive monitoring of 210 individual lions in 18 prides and
   14 male coalitions indicated a declining population, low recruitment,
   low sub-adult and adult male survival, depletion of adult males, and a
   senescing adult female population. Trophy hunting was the leading cause
   of death, with 46 males harvested. Based on these data we recommend
   continuing the hunting ban at least to 2016 to allow recovery, with
   substantially reduced quotas, age-limits, and effective trophy
   monitoring mandated thereafter should hunting resume. Similar data from
   intensive monitoring of key Zambian lion populations is required to
   evaluate effects of the hunting ban and provide management guidance.
   Effectively integrating intensive long-term monitoring and rapid survey
   methods should be a priority for future management and monitoring of
   carnivore species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Predation risk for boreal woodland caribou in human-modified landscapes:
   Evidence of wolf spatial responses independent of apparent competition},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {228},
Pages = {215-223},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Management of wildlife often relies upon understanding mechanisms
   linking anthropogenic disturbance to population declines. The most-cited
   mechanism by which disturbance threatens boreal caribou (Rangifer
   tarandus caribou) is the exacerbation of apparent competition via
   increases in early successional forage, and subsequent changes in the
   densities and distributions of other prey species and gray wolves (Canis
   lupus). An alternative mechanism is the direct alteration of wolf
   distribution via positive responses by wolves to anthropogenic features.
   We conducted a mechanistic evaluation of hypotheses explaining
   human-mediated increases in boreal caribou mortality across northeast
   British Columbia. We evaluated support for (i) numeric apparent
   competition (increased prey densities) by evaluating relationships
   between disturbances, moose (Alces aloes) density, and caribou survival.
   To evaluate (ii) spatial apparent competition (altered prey
   distribution) and (iii) wolf spatial responses (altered wolf
   distribution independent of prey), we modeled the relationships between
   disturbances and indices of caribou-moose and caribou-wolf co-occurrence
   and then examined predation risk for caribou as a function of
   co-occurrence. We did not detect any relationships between anthropogenic
   disturbances, moose density, and caribou survival. Although
   caribou-moose co-occurrence increased predation risk, we observed both
   positive and negative relationships between disturbances and
   caribou-moose co-occurrence. In contrast, caribou-wolf co-occurrence
   increased predation risk and was positively correlated with
   anthropogenic linear features. Contrary to other boreal caribou
   populations, our analyses demonstrate stronger support for the direct
   effects of anthropogenic linear features on caribou-wolf spatial
   overlap, leading to greater risk for caribou. Our research highlights
   the need for region-specific management actions to conserve and recover
   widely distributed species.},

Title = {A generalized approach for producing, quantifying, and validating
   citizen science data from wildlife images},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Citizen science has the potential to expand the scope and scale of
   research in ecology and conservation, but many professional researchers
   remain skeptical of data produced by nonexperts. We devised an approach
   for producing accurate, reliable data from untrained, nonexpert
   volunteers. On the citizen science website www.snapshotserengeti.org,
   more than 28,000 volunteers classified 1.51 million images taken in a
   large-scale camera-trap survey in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania.
   Each image was circulated to, on average, 27 volunteers, and their
   classifications were aggregated using a simple plurality algorithm. We
   validated the aggregated answers against a data set of 3829 images
   verified by experts and calculated 3 certainty metrics-level of
   agreement among classifications (evenness), fraction of classifications
   supporting the aggregated answer (fraction support), and fraction of
   classifiers who reported ``nothing here{''} for an image that was
   ultimately classified as containing an animal (fraction blank)-to
   measure confidence that an aggregated answer was correct. Overall,
   aggregated volunteer answers agreed with the expert-verified data on
   98\% of images, but accuracy differed by species commonness such that
   rare species had higher rates of false positives and false negatives.
   Easily calculated analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukey tests
   indicated that the certainty metrics were significant indicators of
   whether each image was correctly classified or classifiable. Thus, the
   certainty metrics can be used to identify images for expert review.
   Bootstrapping analyses further indicated that 90\% of images were
   correctly classified with just 5 volunteers per image. Species
   classifications based on the plurality vote of multiple citizen
   scientists can provide a reliable foundation for large-scale monitoring
   of African wildlife.},

Title = {Geophysical-laboratory data integration for estimation of groundwater
   volumetric reserve of a coastal hinterland through optimized
   interpolation of interconnected geo-pore architecture},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Ground based geophysical survey involving forty five 1-D geo-sounding
   resistivity procedures was integrated with ten geological rock samples
   (ground truths) to estimate the volumetric quantity of water in probable
   and economically sustainable shallow aquifer system in interconnected
   geo-pore architecture. The volume of usable water in the probable and
   economically accessible depths in the study area was assessed in order
   to estimate the degree of sustainability of groundwater in the face of
   its increasing demand in the coastal region of Akwa Ibom State.
   Integration of vertical electrical sounding (VES) analysis, porosity
   determination from cored aquifer samples and optimization of the
   numerically interpolated volume of aquifer geo-pore architecture were
   deployed to achieve the objective of this research. The VES
   interpretative results furnished geologic layers that are ranging from
   three to four. The resistivity in the first layer ranged from 21.0 to
   1685.1 Omega m with an average of 553.3 Omega m. Layers 2, 3 and 4 have
   their respective ranges of resistivities as 26.3-3688.7 Omega m,
   45.2-3792.5 Omega m and 61.7-1562 Omega m, while their mean values were
   also obtained as 882.8 Omega m, 1192.2 Omega m and 633.0 Omega m
   respectively. The thicknesses of the geologic units for layers 1-3 were
   marked by ranges of 0.4-40.0 m, 5.2-262.6 m and 42.8-237.3 m
   respectively with estimated respective mean values of 8.4 m, 75.1 m and
   102.0 m. The ranges and mean values for the depths of investigation for
   layers 1-3 were 0.4-40.0 m, 6.9-265.0 m and 55.5-290.1 m and 8.2 m, 83.8
   m and 122.5 m respectively. The range of net volume of water in the
   probable and economic aquifer system was estimated to be as (3.76178 +/-
   0.41380) x 10(10) m(3). The optimized volume of water from the aquifer
   system geo-pore architecture is viewed through numerical interpolation
   to be sufficiently inexhaustible in serving the domestic, agricultural
   and industrial purposes for all-season conservation and sustainability
   of ecological make up of the study area. With the estimated groundwater
   reserve, the coastal conservation of flora and fauna as well as
   effective planning for sustainable water supply by stakeholders can be
   guaranteed during the reoccurring, challenging, daring and harsh
   climatic conditions in the coast surveyed.},

Title = {Measuring the spectral signature of polar bears from a drone to improve
   their detection from space},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {237},
Pages = {125-132},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The increasing spatial resolution of earth observation satellites is
   creating new opportunities to survey wildlife. Satellites could be
   particularly valuable for surveying polar bears (Ursus maritimus)
   because of their remote circumpolar distribution and status of concern
   in the face of Arctic warming. However, the white coloration of bears
   does not contrast well with sea ice or snow in panchromatic imagery. We
   took advantage of the close-range observation capabilities of a drone to
   determine the spectral signature of polar bears as they would appear in
   multispectral satellite imagery, capturing low-altitude ( <= 100 m)
   multispectral images of bears in natural landscapes in Churchill,
   Manitoba, Canada. The bears' spectral curves were similar to those
   previously measured from pelts, with reflectance increasing with
   wavelength through the visible spectrum, although live bears had higher
   reflectance than pelts in the red-edge and near-infrared region. Bears
   had sufficiently consistent reflectance across the overhead surface of
   their body that >= 50\% of pixels comprising each subject could be
   confidently matched to its core spectral signature, boding well for
   detection in coarser satellite imagery. Bears were clearly
   distinguishable from snow by their much lower reflectance in the blue
   and green region, but could potentially be confounded with large bright
   boulders. Currently available multispectral satellite imagery may still
   be too coarse (1.2 m/pixel) to reliably detect polar bears on sea ice,
   but resolution will likely continue to increase in future systems.
   Drones are a useful tool to resolve the spectral signature of wildlife
   species that could potentially be detected in satellite imagery.},

Title = {Combining camera-trapping and noninvasive genetic data in a spatial

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {167},
Pages = {242-247},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Abundance and density are key pieces of information for questions
   related to ecology and conservation. These quantities, however, are
   difficult to obtain for rare and elusive species, where even intensive
   sampling effort can yield sparse data. Here, we combine data from
   camera-trapping and noninvasive genetic sampling (scat surveys) of a
   jaguar population in the Caatinga of northeastern Brazil, where the
   species is threatened and little studied. We analyze data of both survey
   types separately and jointly in the framework of spatial capture
   recapture. Density estimates were 1.45 (+/- 0.46) for the camera-trap
   data alone, 2.03 (+/- 0.77) for the genetic data alone, and 1.57 (+/-
   0.43) and 2.45 (+/- 0.70) for the two methods, respectively, in the
   joint analysis. Density and other parameters were estimated more
   precisely in the joint model. Particularly the differences in movement
   between males and females were estimated much more precisely when
   combining both data sources, especially compared to the genetic data set
   alone. When compared to a previous non-spatial capture recapture
   approach, present density estimates were more precise, demonstrating the
   superior statistical performance of spatial over non-spatial capture
   recapture models. The ability to combine different surveys into a single
   analysis with shared parameter allows for more precise population
   estimates, while at the same time enabling researchers to employ
   complementary survey techniques in the study of little known species.

Title = {Impacts of culling and exclusion of browsers on vegetation recovery
   across New Zealand forests},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {64-71},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Introduced browsing animals negatively impact New Zealand's indigenous
   ecosystems. Eradicating introduced browsers is currently unfeasible at
   large scales, but culling since the 1960s has successfully reduced
   populations to a fraction of their earlier sizes. Here we ask whether
   culling of ungulates has allowed populations of woody plant species to
   recover across New Zealand forests. Using 73 pairs of permanent fenced
   exclosure and unfenced control plots, we found rapid increases in
   sapling densities within exclosures located in disturbed forests,
   particularly if a seedling bank was already present. Recovery was slower
   in thinning stands and hampered by dense fern cover. We inferred
   ungulate diet preference from species recovery rates inside exclosures
   to test whether culling increased abundance of preferred species across
   a national network of 574 unfenced permanent forest plots. Across this
   network, saplings were observed irrespective of their preference to
   ungulates in the 1970s, but preferred species were rarer within
   disturbed sites in the 1990s after long-term culling and despite
   nationwide increases in sapling densities. This indicates that preferred
   species are relatively heavily affected by browsing after culling,
   presumably because remaining animals will increase consumption of
   preferred species as competition is reduced. Our results clearly suggest
   that culling will not return preferred plants to the landscape
   immediately, even given suitable conditions for regeneration. Complete
   removal of ungulates rather than simply reducing their densities may be
   required for recovery in heavily browsed temperate forests, but since
   this is only feasible at small spatial scales, management efforts must
   target sites of high conservation value. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {211},

Abstract = {As the invasive grey squirrel continues to spread, red squirrels are
   dying out. The result may be isolated populations in managed parks,
   where access can be controlled. However, recreation can often have a
   negative effect on wildlife, reducing the conservation potential of
   parks. Fota Wildlife Park receives over 300,000 visitors each year and
   is located on an island that is currently free of grey squirrels. We
   examined the effect of visitors on the existing red squirrel population.
   Sampling was conducted in the presence and absence of the public. Ten
   trapping sessions took place from March 2013 to 2014 and faeces were
   collected to examine stress levels. Squirrels were observed to
   concentrate their activity in non-public areas and move into public
   areas when the park was closed. Radio tracked squirrels, from the
   adjacent gardens (intermediate disturbance), also used habitats in the
   wildlife park (high disturbance) when it was closed but returned when
   the park had opened. When squirrels were observed in public areas,
   visitors were only visible on 15\% of occasions. Levels of faecal
   cortisol metabolites (FCM) were highest in areas where human disturbance
   was greatest. However, there was no correlation between visitor numbers
   and the stress levels of squirrels. FCM levels were however, positively
   correlated with density of squirrels. The fact that high numbers of
   squirrels continued to utilise the wildlife park demonstrates that
   managed parks could provide an important reserve for the maintenance of
   the species, as long as non-public areas are accessible.},

Title = {Changing seasonal, temporal and spatial crop-raiding trends over 15
   years in a human-elephant conflict hotspot},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {254},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict is increasing due to rapid natural vegetation
   loss and fragmentation. We investigated seasonal, temporal and spatial
   trends of elephant crop-raiding in the Trans Mara, Kenya during
   2014-2015 and compared our results with a previous study from 1999 to
   2000. Our results show extensive changes in crop raiding patterns. There
   was a 49\% increase in incidents between 1999-2000 and 2014-2015 but an
   83\% decline in the amount of damage per farm. Crop-raiding went from
   highly seasonal during 1999-2000 to yearround during 2014-2015, with
   crops being damaged at all growth stages. Additionally, we identified a
   new elephant group type involved in crop-raiding, comprising of mixed
   groups. Spatial patterns of crop-raiding also changed, with more
   incidents during 2014-2015 neighbouring the protected area, especially
   by bull groups. Crop-raiding intensity during 2014-15 increased with
   farmland area until a threshold of 0.4 km(2) within a 1 km(2) grid
   square, and farms within 1 km from the forest boundary, 5 km from the
   protected area boundary and 2 km from village centres were most at risk
   of crop-raiding. In the last 20 years the Mara Ecosystem has been
   impacted by climate change, agricultural expansion and increased cattle
   grazing within protected areas. Elephants seem to have responded by
   crop-raiding closer to refuges, more frequently and throughout the year
   but cause less damage overall. While this means the direct economic
   impact has dropped, more farmers must spend more time protecting their
   fields, further reducing support for conservation in communities who
   currently receive few benefits from living with wildlife.},

Title = {Every case is different: Cautionary insights about generalisations in
   human-wildlife conflict from a range-wide study of people and jaguars},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {260},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Throughout their range, jaguars (Panthera onca) are persecuted for
   killing livestock, posing a widespread and serious threat to their
   survival. Human-jaguar conflict occurs across a very large variety of
   geographic, agronomic and socio-economic contexts and across
   heterogeneous communities. We conducted seventeen case studies across
   seven countries in central and south America to search for patterns in
   socio-economic predictors of human-jaguar conflict that could help
   up-scale management of this range-wide jaguar conservation challenge.
   Our study revealed that within and across case studies there were
   considerable differences in farmers' education levels, economic
   dependence on livestock, personal experience with livestock losses, as
   well as tolerance of and attitudes and social norms towards jaguars.
   Among this diversity, we sought common predictors of tolerance of
   jaguars, but found that no quantifiable single contextual factor could
   be used to predict how farmers perceive jaguars and deal with
   depredation. While patterns did exist within individual case studies,
   none of these were consistent across a majority of cases. We conclude
   that observations of patterns in human-wildlife conflict are valid only
   for informing action at a local scale, and even if a small number of
   case studies appear to show similar patterns this does not make the
   observation universally true. It is important to remember not to
   generalise from case studies. Nevertheless, although each case is likely
   to require individual solutions, insights from aggregate or wide-range
   studies can provide insights into the range of possible scenarios,
   adding breadth of information to depth of local knowledge.},

Title = {To bait or not to bait: A comparison of camera-trapping methods for
   estimating leopard Panthera pardus density},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {176},
Pages = {153-161},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Leopards have the largest natural distribution of felids, but have lost
   a third of their historical range, and their current CITES status is
   `Near Threatened'. Leopards are a highly sought after trophy species in
   Africa, although their populations are not monitored in most areas.
   Zimbabwe sets the highest leopard quota in Africa, but actual offtake
   does not reflect this, and the number of successful hunts has steadily
   declined in recent years. Accurate data on leopard populations is
   urgently needed, particularly where they are harvested.
   Camera-trapping is a powerful tool for non-invasively researching
   populations of rare and elusive felids, allowing accurate calculation of
   population density, and monitoring trends. However, unbaited
   camera-trapping is plagued by low capture rates, affecting the accuracy
   of the resultant density calculations. In addition, dependent cubs are
   underrepresented in the data, precluding an accurate description of
   demographic structure.
   We compared baited and unbaited camera-trapping methods and resultant
   data quality from two survey areas within our study site. Baited
   camera-trapping significantly increased leopard capture rates, as well
   as recording dependent cubs, which the unbaited method failed to detect.
   In addition, the baited method was more cost effective. Using baits to
   increase capture rates of leopards is more efficient than the unbaited
   method, and has the potential to accurately survey unmonitored
   populations; including where their density is too low to determine
   accurately via other means. These data are required for management of
   leopard populations, especially where harvested, and may be applied to
   improve monitoring efforts of other big cat species. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Physical footprint of oil and gas infrastructure, not anthropogenic
   noise, reduces nesting success of some grassland songbirds},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {204},
Number = {B},
Pages = {434-441},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Western North America's grasslands have undergone a rapid expansion of
   conventional oil and natural gas development, the effects of which are
   largely unknown for nesting songbirds. Understanding mechanisms that
   drive ecological responses to infrastructure is essential for our
   ability to identify and minimize potential negative effects on wildlife.
   Our study sought to distinguish between effects driven by physical
   structures and those driven by associated anthropogenic noise. Further,
   we evaluated whether some structure types have smaller ecological
   footprints than others. We monitored 747 grassland songbird nests, of
   five species, in Alberta's mixed-grass prairie to determine if, and why,
   the presence of infrastructure affects nesting success.
   Nesting success was significantly lower at infrastructure sites relative
   to controls for both Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and
   vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus), as well as at screwpump relative
   to pumpjack oil wells. There was no correlation between nesting success
   and noise intensity, and nesting success was not significantly lower
   near roads. However, nesting success was lower at electric grid-powered
   sites relative to generator-powered sites, suggesting that power
   distribution lines may benefit some nest predators. Vesper sparrow nest
   density increased with proximity to oil wells and compressor stations,
   so it is possible that these sites are ecological traps for this
   species. Management strategies focusing only on reduction of
   anthropogenic noise and disturbance may be ineffectual for conservation
   of grassland songbirds. Managers should Also seek to reduce the physical
   footprint of infrastructure on the landscape, replace screwpumps with
   pumpjacks, and replace grid powered with generator-powered wells. (C)

Title = {Factors associated with co-occurrence of large carnivores in a

Volume = {28},
Number = {6},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We investigated the factors facilitating co-occurrence of two large
   carnivores, tigers (Panthera tigris) and common leopards (Panthera
   pardus), within a human-dominated landscape. We estimated their density
   and population size using camera-trap photographs and examined spatial
   segregation of habitats, temporal activity pattern, and diets in Chitwan
   National Park, Nepal. A Bayesian spatially-explicit capture-recapture
   model estimated densities of 3.2-4.6 (3.94 +/- 0.37) tigers and 2.6-4.1
   (3.31 +/- 0.4) leopards per 100 km(2) with abundance of 70-102 tigers
   and 66-105 leopards. Tigers occupied the prime habitats (grasslands and
   riverine forests) in alluvial floodplains of the Park whereas leopards
   appeared in Sal forests and marginal areas where livestock are present.
   Both tigers and leopards showed crepuscular activity patterns with a
   high overlap but tigers were less active during the day compared to
   leopards. Leopards' activity in the day increased in the presence of
   tigers. Tiger and leopard diet overlapped considerably (90\%). Compared
   to leopards, tigers consumed a higher proportion of the large prey and a
   smaller proportion of livestock. Our study demonstrates that sympatric
   large carnivores can coexist in high densities in prey rich areas that
   contain a mosaics of habitats. To increase the resilience and size of
   the Chitwan carnivore population, strategies are needed to increase prey
   biomass and prevent livestock depredation in adjacent forests. Long-term
   monitoring is also required to obtain a detailed understanding of the
   interaction between the large carnivores and their effects on local
   communities living in forest fringes within the landscape.},

Abstract = {Accurate field identification of illegally traded wildlife and wildlife
   products is critically important in the detection and suppression of
   wildlife crimes. Yet many law enforcement officers and concerned
   citizens lack access to resources for identifying species and products;
   this is particularly true for those with no formal expertise in biology,
   zoology or wildlife training. Emerging digital technologies such as
   mobile applications may provide important easy-to-use decision-tree
   style tools for in situ identification. With local government and civil
   society partners, we are piloting such tools in China and Vietnam to
   identify whole animals and ivory products; and in the United States
   developing tools that will be used at U.S. military bases in Afghanistan
   to identify species from wildlife products. We are coordinating these
   efforts to minimize redundancy and overhead; we benefit from shared
   backend support for a photo database and species ID keys that can be
   translated easily to ensure enough flexibility for targeting needs of
   the specific country and audience. Planned inclusion of `ask the expert'
   and geolocation functions will increase accuracy in identification and
   aid monitoring and research of supply chains. For these emerging
   technologies to be successful, deployment must be accompanied with
   on-the-ground trainings to recruit and retain enforcement personnel. The
   establishment of a supporting network of experts and a user community
   will be critical for long-term implementation and evaluation of success.
   Preliminary response from users of a pilot app in China demonstrates
   high potential for employing these technologies as routine tools to help
   fight wildlife crimes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Drivers of support for citizen science across state wildlife management
   agencies in the United States},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Abstract = {Citizen science (CS) is gaining recognition as a valuable approach to
   meet data needs for environmental projects while fostering collaboration
   between scientists and members of the public. Despite increasing
   implementation of CS by natural resource entities, organizations'
   motivations for engaging in CS remain poorly understood. We examined the
   utility of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and social exchange
   theory (SET) in identifying factors influencing support of CS by
   scientific organizations. To test predictions of the TPB and SET
   theories, we surveyed (quantitative, web based) state wildlife agency
   staff in the United States on their perceptions of organizational
   engagement in CS. We divided questions that measured TPB items into
   individual and organizational components to address the influence of
   personal- and organization-level decision-making on staff perceptions
   and attitudes. We used structural equation modeling to identify key
   constructs that influence staff support of CS in state wildlife
   agencies. The survey yielded 627 responses across 44 states. Both TPB
   and SET constructs accurately predicted staff support of CS; however,
   measures from SET (e.g., public engagement benefits and costs of CS to
   scientific credibility) were most influential (i.e., TPB constructs had
   less impact). Our findings indicate that organizational support for CS
   is primarily influenced by assessment of trade-offs among perceived
   costs and benefits. Indicators of support for CS were further elucidated
   by including measures from the TPB model. Based on our results, we
   suggest that natural resource entities give careful consideration to CS
   project design, develop thorough communication and data management
   plans, and practice iterative evaluation of CS project productivity.},

   wildlife counts from drone-mounted thermal camera surveys},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},

Volume = {31},
Number = {13-14},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The payload size and commercial availability of thermal infrared cameras
   mounted on drones has initiated a new wave in the potential for
   conservationists and researchers to survey, count and detect wildlife,
   even the most complex of habitats such as forest canopies. However,
   several fundamental design and methodological questions remain to be
   tested before standardized monitoring approaches can be broadly adopted.
   We test the impact of both the speed of drone flights and diel flight
   period on tropical rainforest canopy wildlife detections. Detection and
   identification rates differ between both flight speeds and diel time.
   Overall similar to 36\% more detections were made during slower flight
   speeds, along with a greater ability to categorize taxonomic groups.
   Flights conducted at 3am resulted in similar to 67\% more detections
   compared to flights conducted at 7am (the diel period with the lowest
   detection rate). However, 112\% more detections could be identified to
   taxonomic group in 7am flights compared with 3am flights - due to the
   types of wildlife being identified and the assistance of the RGB camera.
   Although, this technology holds great promise for carrying out surveys
   in structurally complex and poorly known ecosystems like forest
   canopies, there is more to do in further methodological testing, and
   building automated post-processing systems. Our results suggest that
   drone studies in the same habitat types, with the same animal densities,
   could be off by multiples if flown during different times and/or at
   different speeds. The difference could be an alarming 5-6x variation in
   animal detections or identification depending on changes in these two
   factors alone.},

Abstract = {Given the rapid pace of renewable energy development, there is need to
   assess impacts of mitigation-driven translocations on sensitive species,
   including federally protected Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus
   agassizii) distributed widely across a global solar energy hotspot. We
   monitored 215 tortoises over 3 years to evaluate trans location effects
   on temperature, condition, growth, and mortality of tortoises adjacent
   to the world's largest solar thermal plant located in southern
   California. On the basis of generalized estimating equation mixed
   models, maximum daily tortoise temperature increased with environmental
   temperature then leveled off at highest environmental temperatures for
   all three groups (translocated, resident, and control) likely due to
   behavioral thermotegulation. This pattern was consistent among groups,
   but translocated tortoises had higher average maximum daily temperature
   and durations above 35 degrees C than resident and control tortoises in
   the first month post-translocation, with smaller effects in the second
   and fourth months, and no differences in subsequent years. During the
   first year, adult translocated males had higher temperatures than
   females. Average percent changes in body condition and carapace length
   increased post-translocation for all groups and there were no
   differences in mortality probability among groups or years. Based on the
   relatively short-term thermal effects, and lack of negative effects on
   condition, growth, or mortality, our study suggests relatively minimal
   impacts following short-distance translocation releases in spring. Our
   study also serves as a unique example and first step for science-based,
   mitigation-driven translocations implemented to evaluate and reduce
   effects of translocation from solar energy development on sensitive
   species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Trophic interactions mediate the response of predator populations to
   habitat change},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {238},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Identifying the mechanisms by which globally pervasive changes in
   habitat affect predators is a central, yet challenging, endeavor in
   applied ecology. Cryptic shifts in trophic interactions are potentially
   important but widely underappreciated mechanisms shaping predator
   population response to habitat change. Here, we assessed the extent to
   which variation in trophic interactions explained differences in
   predator populations at both local and landscape scales. We integrated
   stable isotope analyses, GPS tagging, and long-term territory occupancy
   information to characterize the trophic ecology of spotted owls in the
   Sierra Nevada, California, USA where population trends and densities
   vary among forest landscapes with contrasting land uses and disturbance
   regimes. Trophic interactions appeared to influence spotted owl space
   use and territory occupancy rates with emergent consequences for
   landscape-scale patterns in population abundance and trends.
   Specifically, consumption of woodrats and pocket gophers, which varied
   with habitat conditions, was associated with smaller home ranges and
   lower territory extinction probabilities. Moreover, spotted owls
   consumed significantly more woodrats and pocket gophers in landscapes
   with stable (national parks) and high-occupancy (private lands)
   populations than in landscapes with declining owl populations (national
   forests). Collectively, our results suggest that trophic responses to
   local habitat conditions can affect predators at multiple spatial scales
   and that managing for important prey species habitat may benefit
   predator populations. Because trophic interactions mediate species'
   responses to anthropogenic pressures in many ecological systems, our
   approach to integrating stable isotopes with behavioral, fitness,
   occupancy, and demographic data offers a tractable avenue for
   researchers elsewhere to quantify such relationships.},

Title = {Forests buffer the climate-induced decline of body mass in a mountain
   herbivore},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {16},
Pages = {3741-3752},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change is known to affect key life-history traits, such as body
   mass, reproduction, and survival in many species. Animal populations
   inhabiting mountain habitats are adapted to extreme seasonal
   environmental conditions but are also expected to be especially
   vulnerable to climate change. Studies on mountain ungulates typically
   focus on populations or sections of populations living above the tree
   line, whereas populations inhabiting forested habitats are largely
   understudied. Here, we investigate whether forested areas can mitigate
   the impact of climatic change on life-history traits by evaluating the
   interactive effects of temperature and habitat characteristics on body
   mass variation in the Alpine chamois Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra. We
   examined data of 20,573 yearling chamois collected from 1993 to 2019 in
   28 mountain ranges in the Austrian Eastern Alps, characterized by
   different proportion of forest cover. Our results show that the temporal
   decline of chamois body mass is less pronounced in areas with greater
   proportion of forest cover. For chamois living in forest habitats only,
   no significant temporal change in body mass was detected. Variation in
   body mass was affected by the interaction between density and snow
   cover, as well as by the interaction between spring temperatures and
   forest cover, supporting the role of forests as thermal buffer against
   the effects of increasing temperatures on life-history traits in a
   mountain ungulate. In turn, this study suggests a buffering effect of
   forests against climate change impacts. Assessments of the consequences
   of climate change on the life-history traits and population dynamics of
   mountain-dwelling species should thus consider the plasticity of the
   species with respect to the use and availability of different habitat
   types.},

Title = {Local knowledge to enhance wildlife population health surveillance:
   Conserving muskoxen and caribou in the Canadian Arctic},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {217},
Pages = {337-348},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Monitoring and surveillance of wildlife populations, including
   demographics and health, is often challenging, particularly in
   resource-constrained and remote settings. However, in areas
   characterized by subsistence oriented societies, the users of renewable
   resources hold a vast and holistic ecological knowledge about the
   natural environment. This knowledge can be instrumental for
   understanding and early detection of changes in wildlife populations.
   Using qualitative research methods and participatory epidemiology
   techniques we documented the local knowledge from resource users of the
   community of Iqaluktutiaq (Nunavut, Canada) to assess the health and
   population status and trends for muskoxen and caribou in the area.
   Semi-structured individual interviews, followed by group interviews,
   were implemented with 38 participants, and research findings were
   summarized and then verified with 31 interviewees. Local knowledge
   identified major declines in the number of muskoxen and caribou in the
   study area that were corroborated by subsequent aerial population
   estimates for both species. Observations made by participants allowed
   inference of possible mechanisms for the recent population declines,
   including poor recruitment, poor body condition, and increased morbidity
   and mortality (including endemic and emerging diseases). Engaging
   resource users in the process of knowledge generation was useful to
   identify further research priorities and fostered trust among parties
   that facilitated the subsequent collaborative development of management
   plans for these species. We use our experience to illustrate that local
   knowledge contributes to a holistic understanding of wildlife health and
   can serve as an early warning system to detect changes in wildlife
   populations. These participatory approaches are portable to other
   species and settings and can enhance conservation and co-management
   efforts for wildlife species worldwide.},

Title = {Investigating parasite dynamics of migratory ungulates for sustaining
   healthy populations: Application to critically-endangered saiga
   antelopes Saiga tatarica},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {266},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Contact between wild and domestic ungulates is increasing across
   rangelands, enabling disease co-transmission. Disease management is
   difficult given uncertainties in complex system behavior, limited
   empirical data, and logistical obstacles to interventions. We studied
   gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) transmission in a rangeland shared by
   both livestock and the critically-endangered migratory saiga antelope,
   Saiga tatarica, in order to model infection dynamics under current and
   plausible future scenarios of increasing livestock numbers, climate
   change and anti-helminth treatments. Our model was parameterised for
   trichostrongylid GIN - a cause of mortality and morbidity in ungulates
   globally -using data on observed faecal nematode egg output and host
   numbers and distribution. Results showed that seasonal saiga migration
   leads to asymmetry in parasite transmission, with the majority of GIN
   acquired by saigas in their autumn and winter range through prior
   pasture contamination from livestock. Consequently, reducing parasite
   burdens in livestock early in the season in these areas could
   dispro-portionately reduce cross-transmission to saigas. Early-season
   GIN suppression in livestock in the saiga's spring and summer range was
   predicted to have weaker effect on parasite transmission to saigas but
   reduces infections during the calving period, potentially increasing
   population health and resilience at this critical time. Optimally timed
   treatments could offset the effects of increasing livestock numbers on
   GIN infection pressure, while climate warming had only marginal impacts
   on GIN transmission under all scenarios. Our findings could support
   better understanding and mitigation of factors affecting saiga health
   and rural livelihoods. Our approach is transferable to other systems,
   particularly those with migratory hosts.},

Title = {To protect or neglect? Design, monitoring, and evaluation of a law
   enforcement strategy to recover small populations of wild tigers and
   their prey},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {202},
Pages = {99-109},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Many remaining wild tiger populations persist in small numbers at sites
   where densities are less than half of their estimated carrying capacity
   and will continue to decline if not protected from poaching. Although
   law enforcement is frequently used to protect tigers and their prey, the
   conditions under which enforcement is likely to be effective in
   recovering small populations of wild tigers are not well understood. We
   evaluated the effectiveness of a law enforcement strategy to recover
   tigers and their prey in Lao PDR where extensive habitat provided
   favorable conditions for large increases in tiger numbers if protected
   from poaching. Over a seven-year period, we monitored along a theory of
   change to evaluate assumptions about the causal linkages between
   intermediate results and biological outcomes. Although we found a strong
   positive correlation between funding for enforcement and days patrolled
   (rs = 0.786, n = 7, p = 0.05) and a significant negative correlation
   between days patrolled and overall hunting catch per unit effort (rs =
   -0.893,n = 7, p < 0.05), ultimately a proliferation in snaring was
   associated with decline in several indices of tiger abundance. We
   conclude that actions were sufficient to reduce poaching and increase
   prey populations, but insufficient to curtail extirpation of tigers.
   Recovering small populations of high-value wildlife such as tigers in
   promising source sites is dependent on establishing a complete
   enforcement regime, complimentary strategies that build support for the
   enforcement regime, and a nimble monitoring and evaluation system for
   agile adaptive management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Microhabitat selection by giant pandas},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {247},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Understanding habitat selection is important for effective habitat
   management and recovery of species. However, many habitat selection
   studies are based on presence and absence data and do not differentiate
   the intensity of use and its association with fine-scale habitat
   characteristics. Such information is critical for improving our
   understanding of habitat suitability to inform conservation planning and
   practices, particularly for vulnerable species such as the giant panda
   (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in China. We integrated Global Positioning
   Systems (GPS) tracking data of 5 giant pandas in Wolong Nature Reserve,
   China with detailed vegetation surveys to understand habitat selection
   by giant pandas. We compared microhabitat characteristics between the
   core and secondary home range areas of giant pandas and determined their
   relative importance using a resource selection function (RSF). We found
   that giant panda core areas had higher elevations, shorter distance to
   animal paths, shorter trees, and higher density of bamboo than the
   secondary area. Our findings shed new light on the importance of
   microhabitat characteristics that are generally overlooked in
   coarse-scale models in influencing giant panda habitat selection within
   the home range, such as bamboo density and accessibility to habitat that
   play important roles in the determination of core areas. We suggest
   prioritizing dense bamboo forests and areas with animal paths to improve
   giant pandas' habitat management, restoration, and corridor
   construction. The methods we used here regarding combining GPS-tracking
   derived intensity of use data and detailed habitat surveys could also be
   applied to better understand habitat selection strategies of a variety
   of other wildlife species.},

Title = {Responses of a wild ungulate assemblage to anthropogenic influences in
   Manas National Park, India},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {243},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Large carnivores have experienced significant global range contractions
   and recovering their populations is often contingent on increasing prey
   abundances. In Manas National Park (MNP), following nearly two decades
   of ethnopolitical conflict, studies document that populations of both
   prey and predators were depressed. Here we assess the status of wild
   ungulates in a section of MNP (Bansbari-Bhuyanpara) that has remained
   conflict-free for over a decade. For seven ungulate species, we estimate
   species-specific densities using distance-based sampling, assess
   species-specific space-use patterns in relation to habitat variables
   within an occupancy framework and examine patterns of temporal activity
   in relation to times when people access the park for resources. Further,
   by comparing temporal activity patterns of ungulates between MNP, a site
   where local communities access the park for resources, and Kaziranga
   National Park, where human use of the park is minimal, we examine if
   species activity is altered in response to human presence. We estimate
   that currently Bansbari-Bhuyanpara ranges of MNP support 42.66
   (34.16-51.16) individual ungulates/km(2). Our results highlight that
   current patterns of human access within the park affect both spatial and
   temporal behaviour of these species. Although we estimate a relatively
   high recovery potential for tigers in MNP given current prey densities,
   we suggest that further ungulate population recoveries could be
   supported in the park. With several ungulate species experiencing
   range-wide declines, efforts to minimize non-lethal human disturbances
   on these species also need to be considered to ensure that predator-prey
   systems remain intact.},

Title = {Survey-based assessment of the frequency and potential impacts of
   recreation on polar bears},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {227},
Pages = {121-132},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Conservation plans for polar bears (Ursus maritanus) typically cannot
   prescribe management actions to address their primary threat: sea ice
   loss associated with climate warming. However, there may be other
   stressors that compound the negative effects of sea ice loss which can
   be mitigated. For example, Arctic tourism has increased concurrent with
   polar bears increasingly using terrestrial habitats, which creates the
   potential for increased human-bear interactions. Little is known about
   the types, frequency, or potential impacts of recreation. We conducted a
   Delphi survey among experts who live and work in polar bear habitats,
   followed by an internet-based survey to which 47 managers, tour
   operators, community members, and scientists contributed. Participants
   identified viewing-based recreation as increasing and affecting the
   largest proportion of bears within subpopulations that come ashore
   during the ice-free season. Survey respondents suggested that negative
   effects of viewing, including displacement and habituation, could be
   reduced by restricting human use areas and distances between bears and
   people. Killing of bears in defense was associated more with camping or
   hunting for other species than other recreations, and may be mitigated
   with deterrents. Snowmobiling was the most common recreation across the
   polar bears' range, and reportedly caused some den abandonment and
   displacement. However, respondents estimated that < 10\% of polar bears
   are exposed to most types of recreation and < 50\% surmised any negative
   impacts. Nevertheless, mitigating some of the negative impacts
   identified in this study may become increasingly important as polar
   bears cope with sea ice loss.},

Title = {Genetic and environmental influences on pup mortality risk for wolves
   and coyotes within a Canis hybrid zone},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {166},
Pages = {133-141},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Eastern wolves (Canis lycaon) are a species of special concern federally
   in Canada that have hybridized extensively with coyotes (Canis la trans)
   and gray wolves (Canis lupus) in and adjacent to Algonquin Provincial
   Park (APP), Ontario. A comprehensive understanding of eastern wolf
   demography and wolf-coyote hybridization dynamics is needed for informed
   management, yet no studies have investigated the influence of genetic
   ancestry and environmental heterogeneity on survival of wolf, coyote,
   and hybrid pups. We used telemetry, genetic, and environmental data to
   model and estimate genotype-specific survival and cause-specific
   mortality of Canis pups (n = 159) in eastern and western APP (2002-2011)
   and the adjacent Wildlife Management Unit 49 (WMU49; 2008-2011). Pup
   survival was higher in eastern APP ((s) over cap= 0.75) and WMU49
   (<(s)over cap = 0.61) than in western APP (<(s)over cap = 0.25). In APP,
   mortality risk of pups was primarily influenced by prey availability as
   lower beaver density in western APP negatively influenced survival and
   increased starvation risk. Genetic ancestry only influenced pup
   mortality risk outside of APP with eastern wolf x coyote hybrids
   surviving poorly relative to other Canis types in WMU49. Poor survival
   of pups in western APP reduces dispersal from the protected area and
   decreases the likelihood of expansion of this genetically distinct
   eastern wolf population beyond APP. Our results advance understanding of
   wolf and coyote demography as no previous studies have investigated
   genetic and environmental factors influencing mortality of wolf and
   coyote pups <4-5 months of age with telemetry data. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Thirsty peaks: Drought events drive keystone shrub decline in an oceanic
   island mountain},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {215},
Pages = {99-106},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Oceanic islands ecosystems are among the most endangered in the world,
   as the effects of ongoing climate change may potentially combine with
   other pre-existing drivers of plant population decline. In the Canary
   Islands, nitrogen-fixing Teide broom (Spartocytisus supranubius) is a
   keystone species in the Teide National Park high mountain ecosystem.
   However, recruitment failure due to introduced herbivores and dieback
   episodes are decimating its populations. We explored the role of climate
   as a potential driver of Teide broom mortality. We analyzed annual rings
   of Teide broom to reconstruct the impact of climate on secondary growth,
   intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) and mortality, and to explore the
   potential for growth rates and levels of resilience to act as indicators
   of mortality risk. We found that higher precipitation from October to
   February improved Teide broom secondary growth, whereas iWUE increased
   with high July August temperatures. Extreme drought events in 2001 and
   2012 strongly reduced secondary growth and resulted in subsequent plant
   death. Individuals that subsequently died had lower growth rates, poorer
   capacity for growth recovery after drought events and marginally higher
   iWUE than those which survived. More frequent recurrence of extreme
   drought events in the future would increase the frequency of dieback
   episodes, and the combination of a decline in mature individuals and
   lower recruitment rates due to exotic herbivore pressure would mean an
   uncertain future for the Teide broom. Our results indicate how global
   change may impact keystone species in protected areas and highlight the
   need for urgent implementation of proactive conservation policies.},

Title = {Flexible habitat selection by cougars in response to anthropogenic
   development},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {178},
Pages = {136-145},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Large carnivore populations are imperiled worldwide through habitat
   loss, insufficient prey, and intolerance by people, promoting concerns
   that their populations will persist only in protected areas and remote
   regions. This assumption is challenged by recent colonization of areas
   with high human use in the former ranges of several carnivore species,
   including cougars (Puma concolor). We hypothesized that cougars adjust
   their behavior to accommodate anthropogenic development, facilitating
   successful use of modified habitats. We tested this hypothesis using
   resource selection functions for 42 individual cougars maintaining home
   ranges across a gradient of anthropogenic development. We evaluated
   variation in selection among individual cougars by time of day,
   home-range location (i.e., rural vs. wilderness cougars), and using
   functional response curves. Cougars stayed further away from both roads
   and buildings during the day than they did at night, and wilderness
   cougars showed stronger avoidance of anthropogenic features than did
   their rural counterparts. Selection patterns of individual cougars
   varied greatly, and some of this variation was explained by the
   functional response. For example, cougars decreased their avoidance of
   some anthropogenic features as those features became more prevalent on
   the landscape. Failure to account for potential functional responses in
   habitat selection could lead to overestimation of negative impacts of
   development for adaptable large carnivores. Given high adaptability to
   anthropogenic habitat modification displayed by cougars, cougar
   persistence in increasingly developed landscapes may depend more on
   human tolerance than on maintaining large tracts of pristine wilderness.

Abstract = {Environmental change is multidimensional, with local anthropogenic
   stressors and global climate change interacting to differentially impact
   populations throughout a species' geographic range. Within species, the
   spatial distribution of phenotypic variation and its causes (i.e., local
   adaptation or plasticity) will determine species' adaptive capacity to
   respond to a changing environment. However, comparatively less is known
   about the spatial scale of adaptive differentiation among populations
   and how patterns of local adaptation might drive vulnerability to global
   change stressors. To test whether fine-scale (2-12 km) mosaics of
   environmental stress can cause adaptive differentiation in a marine
   foundation species, eelgrass (Zostera marina), we conducted a three-way
   reciprocal transplant experiment spanning the length of Tomales Bay, CA.
   Our results revealed strong home-site advantage in growth and survival
   for all three populations. In subsequent common garden experiments and
   feeding assays, we showed that countergradients in temperature, light
   availability, and grazing pressure from an introduced herbivore
   contribute to differential performance among populations consistent with
   local adaptation. Our findings highlight how local-scale mosaics in
   environmental stressors can increase phenotypic variation among
   neighboring populations, potentially increasing species resilience to
   future global change. More specifically, we identified a range-center
   eelgrass population that is pre-adapted to extremely warm temperatures
   similar to those experienced by low-latitude range-edge populations of
   eelgrass, demonstrating how reservoirs of heat-tolerant phenotypes may
   already exist throughout a species range. Future work on predicting
   species resilience to global change should incorporate potential
   buffering effects of local-scale population differentiation and promote
   a phenotypic management approach to species conservation.},

Abstract = {Societal Impact Statement
   People tend to see plants as the background to life on Earth, but they
   are essential to our very existence in many ways. In 1999 two
   botanist-educators from the United States coined the term ``plant
   blindness{''} to describe this condition, and to draw attention to the
   decreasing focus on plants in education. Here I argue that disregard for
   any organism that is not a vertebrate (like us) is the more pervasive
   problem, but that combatting plant blindness is a good place to start to
   improve education, awareness, and care for the other organisms with
   which we share planet Earth.
   SummaryThe concept of ``plant blindness{''} was coined in 1999 to
   highlight the phenomenon seen in American (United States) education in
   which animals are perceived as more important than plants. Symptoms were
   lack of recognition of plants as important components of ecosystems,
   lack of understanding of how plants affect our everyday lives,
   anthropocentric ratings of animals as more worthy of care than plants,
   and inability to ``see{''} that plants are more than background. I argue
   here that the deeper problem is not with animals versus plants, but with
   ``animals with eyes like ours and backbones{''} versus everything else.
   Cockroaches, worms, and spiders are animals too, and without them the
   planet would be as barren as if there were no plants. So combatting the
   more pervasive issue needs to be at the background of our thinking as we
   move forward in combatting plant blindness. I here review the symptoms
   of plant blindness and relate this to ways in which we might begin to
   think about using recognition of plant blindness as a way to increase
   awareness and care for all of life on Earth.},

Title = {Natural coastal dunes on Wadden Sea islands as a refuge for an
   endangered wader species},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Europe holds globally important populations of breeding waders. However,
   most of the species are in steep decline, including the Eurasian Curlew
   (Numenius arquata). Here, we studied the breeding-territory and
   nest-site preferences of a Curlew subpopulation that has, in contrast to
   the overall trend, been increasing, on the East Frisian Islands (Wadden
   Sea National Park of Lower Saxony, N Germany). The islands are mostly
   free from ground predators and intensive agriculture and thus offer the
   opportunity to examine habitat preferences in largely undisturbed
   habitats. Our study revealed that Curlews preferred breeding in habitat
   mosaics dominated by high marshes and dune grasslands, far from areas
   with human disturbance. For nest-building, heterogeneous microhabitats
   with intermediate vegetation cover and height and some bare ground were
   preferred. This reflects a trade-off between (i) sufficient shelter for
   nests and fledglings, (ii) early recognition of predators and (iii)
   readily available and accessible invertebrate prey. Such heterogeneous
   habitats, without mammalian predators, are largely missing in the
   intensively used agricultural landscapes of the European mainland.
   Consequently, Curlew populations on the mainland are mostly declining.
   In contrast, those on the East-Frisian Islands are stable and,
   therefore, of prime importance for the protection of the species. Thus,
   the study highlights the importance of isolated islands providing
   natural habitats like coastal dunes, which are free from ground
   predators and extensive human disturbance for the long-term survival of
   Curlew populations. Based on the results of this study we make
   suggestions to improve future conservation measures for degraded
   habitats to boost curlew populations.},

Title = {Prioritizing restoration of fragmented landscapes for wildlife
   conservation: A graph-theoretic approach},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {232},
Pages = {173-186},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances fragmenting wildlife habitat greatly
   contribute to extinction risk for many species. In western Canada, four
   decades of oil and gas exploration have created a network of seismic
   lines, which are linear disturbances where seismic equipment operates.
   Seismic lines cause habitat fragmentation and increase predator access
   to intact forest, leading to declines of some wildlife populations,
   particularly the threatened woodland caribou, Rangifer tarandus caribou.
   Restoration of forests within seismic lines is an important activity to
   reduce habitat fragmentation and recovery caribou. We present an
   optimization model with the objective of guiding landscape restoration
   strategies that maximize the area of connected habitat for a caribou
   population in a fragmented landscape. We use our model to find optimal
   strategies for seismic line restoration in the Cold Lake Area of
   Alberta, Canada, a 6726-km(2) expanse of boreal forest that represents
   prime caribou habitat. We formulate mixed integer programming models
   that depict the landscape as a network of interconnected habitat
   patches. We develop and compare formulations that emphasize the
   population's local or long-distance access to habitat. Optimal
   restoration involves a mix of two strategies: the first establishes
   short-distance connections between forest patches with large areas of
   intact habitat and the second establishes corridors between areas with
   known species locations and large amounts of suitable habitat. Our
   approach reveals the trade-offs between these strategies and finds the
   optimal restoration solutions under a limited budget. The approach is
   generalizable and applicable to other regions and species sensitive to
   changes in landscape-level habitat connectivity.},

Title = {Land sharing is essential for snow leopard conservation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {203},
Pages = {1-7},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Conserving large carnivores in an increasingly crowded planet raises
   difficult challenges. A recurring debate is whether large carnivores can
   be conserved in human used landscapes (land sharing) or whether they
   require specially designated areas (land sparing). Here we show that
   40\% of the 170 protected areas in the global range of the snow leopard
   (Panthera uncia) are smaller than the home range of a single adult male
   and only 4-13\% are large enough for a 90\% probability of containing 15
   or more adult females. We used data from 16 snow leopards equipped with
   GPS collars in the Tost Mountains of South Gobi, Mongolia, to calculate
   home range size and overlap using three different estimators: minimum
   convex polygons (MCP), kernel utility distributions (Kernel), and local
   convex hulls (LoCoH). Local convex hull home ranges were smaller and
   included lower proportions of unused habitats compared to home ranges
   based on minimum convex polygons and Kernels. Intra-sexual home range
   overlap was low, especially for adult males, suggesting that snow
   leopards are territorial. Mean home range size based on the LoCoH
   estimates was 207 km(2) +/- 63 SD for adult males and 124 km(2) +/- 41
   SD for adult females. Our estimates were 6-44 times larger than earlier
   estimates based on VHF technology when comparing similar estimators,
   i.e. MCP. Our study illustrates that protected areas alone will not be
   able to conserve predators with large home ranges and conservationists
   and managers should not restrict their efforts to land sparing. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Climate change is a major challenge for managers of protected areas
   world-wide, and managers need information about future climate
   conditions within protected areas. Prior studies of climate change
   effects in protected areas have largely focused on average climatic
   conditions. However, extreme weather may have stronger effects on
   wildlife populations and habitats than changes in averages. Our goal was
   to quantify future changes in the frequency of extreme heat, drought,
   and false springs, during the avian breeding season, in 415 National
   Wildlife Refuges in the conterminous United States. We analyzed
   spatially detailed data on extreme weather frequencies during the
   historical period (1950-2005) and under different scenarios of future
   climate change by mid- and late-21st century. We found that all wildlife
   refuges will likely experience substantial changes in the frequencies of
   extreme weather, but the types of projected changes differed among
   refuges. Extreme heat is projected to increase dramatically in all
   wildlife refuges, whereas changes in droughts and false springs are
   projected to increase or decrease on a regional basis. Half of all
   wildlife refuges are projected to see increases in frequency (>20\%
   higher than the current rate) in at least two types of weather extremes
   by mid-century. Wildlife refuges in the Southwest and Pacific Southwest
   are projected to exhibit the fastest rates of change, and may deserve
   extra attention. Climate change adaptation strategies in protected
   areas, such as the U.S. wildlife refuges, may need to seriously consider
   future changes in extreme weather, including the considerable spatial
   variation of these changes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Independence and juvenile dispersal distances in wild and reintroduced
   Spanish imperial eagles},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {191},
Pages = {300-305},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Reintroductions have been increasingly used for species restoration and
   it seems that this conservation tool is going to be more used in the
   future. Consequently a better knowledge of consequences of this kind of
   management is needed. Several authors have found differences in
   dispersal distances among wild and reintroduced individuals; although no
   common explanation for this general trend (Le. released animals moving
   farther than wild ones) has been proposed. Here we compared the dates of
   dispersal and the distribution of maximum distances during juvenile
   dispersal between a natural high density population and an alternative
   situation where young Spanish imperial eagles (Aquila adalberti) were
   reintroduced in a new area with a very low intra-specific density, and
   ad libitum feeding until the onset of dispersal. Results showed that
   maximum dispersal distances were longer in translocated (mean = 205 km)
   than in control juvenile eagles (mean = 119.70 km), and the shape of the
   distribution changed from leptokurtic right-skewed to quasi-normal.
   According to our results, for reintroduced young fed ad libitum, we can
   predict that effective dispersal distances will be longer in
   reintroduced young during juvenile dispersal than in natural
   populations. But dispersal distances might also depend on the distance
   from the release area to the nearest breeding population of the species.
   For reintroductions close to other existing populations, immigration of
   released young into existing populations would be greater than expected.

Title = {Optimal design of compact and connected nature reserves for multiple
   species},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {413-424},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {When designing a conservation reserve system for multiple species,
   spatial attributes of the reserves must be taken into account at species
   level. The existing optimal reserve design literature considers either
   one spatial attribute or when multiple attributes are considered the
   analysis is restricted only to one species. We built a linear integer
   programing model that incorporates compactness and connectivity of the
   landscape reserved for multiple species. The model identifies multiple
   reserves that each serve a subset of target species with a specified
   coverage probability threshold to ensure the species' long-term survival
   in the reserve, and each target species is covered (protected) with
   another probability threshold at the reserve system level. We modeled
   compactness by minimizing the total distance between selected sites and
   central sites, and we modeled connectivity of a selected site to its
   designated central site by selecting at least one of its adjacent sites
   that has a nearer distance to the central site. We considered structural
   distance and functional distances that incorporated site quality between
   sites. We tested the model using randomly generated data on 2 species,
   one ground species that required structural connectivity and the other
   an avian species that required functional connectivity. We applied the
   model to 10 bird species listed as endangered by the state of Illinois
   (U.S.A.). Spatial coherence and selection cost of the reserves differed
   substantially depending on the weights assigned to these 2 criteria. The
   model can be used to design a reserve system for multiple species,
   especially species whose habitats are far apart in which case multiple
   disjunct but compact and connected reserves are advantageous. The model
   can be modified to increase or decrease the distance between reserves to
   reduce or promote population connectivity.
   El Diseno ptimo de Reservas Naturales Compactas y Conectadas para
   Multiples Especies Cuando se disena un sistema de reservas de
   conservacion para multiples especies, los atributos espaciales de las
   reservas deben considerarse al nivel de especie. La bibliografia
   existente sobre el diseno optimo de reservas considera a un atributo
   espacial o, cuando se consideran multiples atributos, el analisis esta
   limitado a una especie. Construimos un modelo de programacion entera
   lineal que incorpora la compactibilidad y la conectividad del paisaje
   reservado para multiples especies. El modelo identifica a varias
   reservas, de las cuales cada una sirve a un subconjunto de especies
   objetivo con un umbral de probabilidad de cobertura especifica para
   asegurar la supervivencia de la especie a largo plazo dentro de la
   reserva, y cada especie objetivo esta protegida por otro umbral de
   probabilidad a nivel de sistema de reservas. Modelamos la
   compactibilidad al minimizar la distancia total entre los sitios
   seleccionados y los sitios centrales, y la conectividad de un sitio
   seleccionado con su sitio central designado fue modelada al elegir por
   lo menos uno de sus sitios adyacentes que tuviera una distancia mas
   cercana al sitio central. Consideramos la distancia estructural y las
   distancias funcionales que incorporaran la calidad de sitio entre los
   sitios. Evaluamos el modelo usando datos de dos especies generados al
   azar, una especie terrestre que requeria conectividad estructural y una
   especie de ave que requeria de conectividad funcional. Aplicamos el
   modelo a 10 especies de aves categorizadas como en peligro por el estado
   de Illinois (EUA). La coherencia espacial y el costo de seleccion de las
   reservas difirieron sustancialmente dependiendo del peso asignado a
   estos dos criterios. El modelo puede usarse para disenar un sistema de
   reservas para multiples especies, especialmente aquellas cuyos habitats
   estan distanciados y en cuyo caso es ventajoso tener multiples reservas
   disyuntas pero compactas y conectadas. El modelo puede modificarse para
   incrementar o disminuir la distancia entre las reservas para reducir o
   promover la conectividad del habitat.

Title = {Coevolution as an engine of biodiversity and a cornucopia of ecosystem
   services},

Abstract = {Societal Impact Statement Coevolutionary processes, which have governed
   interactions between organisms throughout the history of life, also
   serve as an engine of ecosystem services for humans. The escalating arms
   races between plants and herbivores, flowers and pollinators, have
   generated a cornucopia of foods, raw materials, perfumes, spices,
   ornamentals, medicines, and drugs. Human history is replete with
   aesthetic as well as economic inspiration drawn from such plants. Our
   future may depend on similar inspiration, as we confront novel health,
   agricultural, and environmental challenges in the face of global change.
   Summary
   ``Coevolution{''} was coined to conceptualize escalating arms races
   between plants and herbivores in evolutionary time, often mediated by
   natural products. Our current view embraces broader coevolutionary
   relationships between obligate mutualists, symbionts, parasites, and
   enemies, which frequently increase rates of diversification in
   coevolving lineages. Because humans benefit from the foods, materials,
   and drugs produced by plants in response to reciprocal selective
   pressures, coevolutionary ``escape and radiate{''} diversification may
   amplify ecosystem services along with species richness, with humans as
   beneficiaries. For example, coevolutionary escalation of defenses
   between Burseraceae and their herbivores resulted in hundreds of
   resinous tree species, anchoring the trade of copal, frankincense, and
   myrrh across the ancient world. Examination of three diverse angiosperm
   orders (Asparagales, Malpighiales, and Gentianales), reveals ecosystem
   services in the form of alkaloids and hallucinogens, perfumes, spices,
   coffee, and rubber. Pollinator-mediated selection by hawk moths and bats
   gave rise to heavily perfumed ``moonflowers{''} (gardenias and jasmines)
   with aesthetic appeal to humans, and to immense blooming displays by
   agave plants, co-opted by humans as a source of tequila and mezcal. Even
   when pollinator-mediated diversification does not arise through
   coevolution, the resulting biotic richness provides evolutionary
   insights as well as ecosystem services. The convergent evolution of
   ``kettle-trap{''} flowers in species-rich plant lineages (Aristolochia
   and Ceropegia) reveals the surprising value of small flies as
   pollinators and the opportunity to develop biocontrol that leverages
   floral features attractive to agricultural pests and disease vectors.
   This article highlights coevolution as a source of ecosystem services
   and potential solutions to the emerging challenges of global change.},

Abstract = {Background: Since ancient times, invertebrates have played an important
   role in the traditional medicine in many parts of the world. In
   south-eastern Benin, more specifically in the Plateau Department,
   invertebrates are widely used in folk medicine. However, studies on
   their therapeutic use has been neglected and their magical-religious
   purposes are poorly understood. The present study aims to document
   traditional knowledge related to the use of invertebrates for medicinal
   and magical-religious purposes by traditional healers and indigenous
   people of Plateau Department.
   Methods: An ethno-sociological survey was conducted with 145 informants
   (80 traditional healers, 12 merchants of medicinal animals and 53
   households) belonging to six ethnic groups, in 20 villages located in
   Plateau of Benin. Data were collected through the participatory rural
   appraisal method involving individual interviews and direct observations
   with semi-structured questionnaires. The collected data regarding
   various medicinal and magical-religious uses of invertebrates were
   analysed through informant consensus factor (ICF), use value (UV) and,
   fidelity level (FL).
   Results: A total of 20 families and 38 species of invertebrates,
   distributed among 6 taxonomic categories, were found to be used to treat
   50 different ailments. Insects occupied 64.7\% of the total
   invertebrates listed. The African earthworm Eudrilus eugeniae K. and
   African giant snail Achatina achatina L. had the highest use values. The
   highest ICF value (1.0) was cited for diseases of the blood or
   blood-forming organs. A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the
   influence of ethnic groups in the diseases treated with invertebrates.
   The highest FL (100\%) was recorded for 12 invertebrate species treating
   various ailments. Most of invertebrate-based remedies were associated
   with plant species. The mode of administration was mainly oral and
   topical. Most of the invertebrate drugs were traditionally collected in
   nature or imported, mainly from Nigeria. In addition, 7
   magical-religious practices are documented.
   Conclusions: Our results reveal that several invertebrate species play
   an important role in healing practices and magical-religious rituals in
   the Plateau Department. We suggest further studies to confirm the
   presence of any bioactive compounds on invertebrate species use in
   traditional medicine. In addition, this study highlights the need for
   ecological investigations of these species, in order to develop
   strategies for their conservation and sustainable use.},

Title = {Does livestock benefit or harm snow leopards?},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {190},
Pages = {8-13},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Large carnivores commonly prey on livestock when their ranges overlap.
   Pastoralism is the dominant land use type across the distributional
   range of the endangered snow leopard Panthera uncia. Snow leopards are
   often killed in retaliation against livestock depredation. Whether
   livestock, by forming an alternative prey, could potentially benefit
   snow leopards, or, whether livestock use of an area is detrimental to
   snow leopards is poorly understood. We examined snow leopard habitat use
   in a multiple use landscape that was comprised of sites varying in
   livestock abundance, wild prey abundance and human population size. We
   photographically sampled ten sites (average size 70 sq. km) using ten
   camera traps in each site, deployed for a period of 60 days. Snow
   leopard habitat use was computed as a Relative Use Index based on the
   total independent photographic captures and the number of snow leopard
   individuals captured at each site. We quantified livestock abundance,
   wild prey abundance, human population size and terrain ruggedness in
   each of the sites. Key variables influencing snow leopard habitat use
   were identified using Information Theory based model selection approach.
   Snow leopard habitat use was best explained by wild prey density, and
   showed a positive linear relationship with the abundance of wild
   ungulates. We found a hump-shaped relationship between snow leopard
   habitat use and livestock stocking density, with an initial increase in
   habitat use followed by a decline beyond a threshold of livestock
   density. Our results suggest that in the absence of direct persecution
   of snow leopards, livestock grazing and snow leopard habitat use are
   potentially compatible up to a certain threshold of livestock density,
   beyond which habitat use declines, presumably due to depressed wild
   ungulate abundance and associated anthropogenic disturbance. (C) 2015

Title = {Predicting invasion in grassland ecosystems: is exotic dominance the

Abstract = {Invasions have increased the size of regional species pools, but are
   typically assumed to reduce native diversity. However, global-scale
   tests of this assumption have been elusive because of the focus on
   exotic species richness, rather than relative abundance. This is
   problematic because low invader richness can indicate invasion
   resistance by the native community or, alternatively, dominance by a
   single exotic species. Here, we used a globally replicated study to
   quantify relationships between exotic richness and abundance in
   grass-dominated ecosystems in 13 countries on six continents, ranging
   from salt marshes to alpine tundra. We tested effects of human land use,
   native community diversity, herbivore pressure, and nutrient limitation
   on exotic plant dominance. Despite its widespread use, exotic richness
   was a poor proxy for exotic dominance at low exotic richness, because
   sites that contained few exotic species ranged from relatively pristine
   (low exotic richness and cover) to almost completely exotic-dominated
   ones (low exotic richness but high exotic cover). Both exotic cover and
   richness were predicted by native plant diversity (native grass
   richness) and land use (distance to cultivation). Although climate was
   important for predicting both exotic cover and richness, climatic
   factors predicting cover (precipitation variability) differed from those
   predicting richness (maximum temperature and mean temperature in the
   wettest quarter). Herbivory and nutrient limitation did not predict
   exotic richness or cover. Exotic dominance was greatest in areas with
   low native grass richness at the site- or regional-scale. Although this
   could reflect native grass displacement, a lack of biotic resistance is
   a more likely explanation, given that grasses comprise the most
   aggressive invaders. These findings underscore the need to move beyond
   richness as a surrogate for the extent of invasion, because this metric
   confounds monodominance with invasion resistance. Monitoring species'
   relative abundance will more rapidly advance our understanding of
   invasions.},

Abstract = {Species listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (i.e., listed
   species) have declined to the point that the probability of their
   extinction is high. The decline of these species, however, may manifest
   itself in different ways, including reductions in geographic range,
   number of populations, or overall abundance. Understanding the pattern
   of decline can help managers assess extinction probability and define
   recovery objectives. Although quantitative data on changes in geographic
   range, number of populations, and abundance usually do not exist for
   listed species, more often qualitative data can be obtained. We used
   qualitative data in recovery plans for federally listed species to
   determine whether each listed species declined in range size, number of
   populations, or abundance relative to historical levels. We calculated
   the proportion of listed species in each state (or equivalent) that
   declined in each of those ways. Nearly all listed species declined in
   abundance, and range size or number of populations declined in
   approximately 80\% of species for which those data were available.
   Patterns of decline, however, differed taxonomically and geographically.
   Declines in range were more common among vertebrates than plants,
   whereas population extirpations were more common among plants.
   Invertebrates had high incidence of range and population declines.
   Narrowly distributed plants and invertebrates may be subject to acute
   threats that may result in population extirpations, whereas vertebrates
   may be affected by chronic threats that reduce the extent and size of
   populations. Additionally, in the eastern United States and U.S. coastal
   areas, where the level of land conversion is high, a greater percentage
   of species' ranges declined and more populations were extirpated than in
   other areas. Species in the Southwest, especially plants, had fewer
   range and population declines than other areas. Such relations may help
   in the selection of species' recovery criteria.},

Title = {Potential of a national monitoring program for forests to assess change

Abstract = {Broad-scale monitoring in Alaska has become of increasing interest due
   to uncertainty about the potential impacts of changing climate on
   high-latitude ecosystems. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)
   program is a national monitoring program for all public and private
   forestlands in the US, but the program is not currently implemented in
   the boreal region of Alaska. We provide an overview of the strengths and
   weaknesses of the FIA system for monitoring the potential impact of
   climate change on Alaska's species, communities, and ecosystems. The
   primary strength of the system is a scientifically rigorous design-based
   statistical estimation method that produces estimates of forest
   attributes with known sampling error and quantifiable measurement error.
   The weaknesses of the system include low power for small area estimates,
   lack of spatial context and contiguity, and difficulty in inferring
   causality of factors when changes in monitored attributes are detected.
   Climate change is expected to impact many components of boreal
   ecosystems, but for most indicators the direction and magnitude of
   change are difficult to predict because of complex interactions among
   system components. Status and trend information provided by FIA
   monitoring that could be helpful to conservation decisions includes
   abundance and rarity of vascular plants, invasive species, biomass and
   carbon content of vegetation, shifting vegetation species distribution,
   disturbance frequency, type, and impact, and wildlife habitat
   characteristics. Because of unique factors such as the low level of
   infrastructure, modifications to the HA monitoring system used in the
   conterminous US have been proposed for Alaska. Remote sensing data would
   play a greater role in meeting monitoring objectives, and sampling

Title = {Species composition of the international shark fin trade assessed

Abstract = {The shark fin trade is a major driver of shark exploitation in fisheries
   all over the world, most of which are not managed on a species-specific
   basis. Species-specific trade information highlights taxa of particular
   concern and can be used to assess the efficacy of management measures
   and anticipate emerging threats. The species composition of the Hong
   Kong Special Administrative Region of China, one of the world's largest
   fin trading hubs, was partially assessed in 1999-2001. We randomly
   selected and genetically identified fin trimmings (n = 4800), produced
   during fin processing, from the retail market of Hong Kong in 2014-2015
   to assess contemporary species composition of the fin trade. We used
   nonparametric species estimators to determine that at least 76 species
   of sharks, batoids, and chimaeras supplied the fin trade and a Bayesian
   model to determine their relative proportion in the market. The
   diversity of traded species suggests species substitution could mask
   depletion of vulnerable species; one-third of identified species are
   threatened with extinction. The Bayesian model suggested that 8 species
   each comprised >1\% of the fin trimmings (34.1-64.2\% for blue
   {[}Prionace glauca], 0.2-1.2\% for bull {[}Carcharhinus leucas] and
   shortfin mako {[}Isurus oxyrinchus]); thus, trade was skewed to a few
   globally distributed species. Several other coastal sharks, batoids, and
   chimaeras are in the trade but poorly managed. Fewer than 10 of the
   species we modeled have sustainably managed fisheries anywhere in their
   range, and the most common species in trade, the blue shark, was not
   among them. Our study and approach serve as a baseline to track changes
   in composition of species in the fin trade over time to better
   understand patterns of exploitation and assess the effects of emerging
   management actions for these animals.},

Title = {Mesopredator spatial and temporal responses to large predators and human
   development in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {190},
Pages = {23-33},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Human-driven declines of apex predators can trigger widespread impacts
   throughout ecological communities. Reduced apex predator occupancy or
   activity can release mesopredators from intraguild competition, with
   unknown repercussions on the ecological community. As exurban
   development continues to expand worldwide, it is important to document
   how mesopredators are impacted by the combined influences of apex
   predators and humans. We used motion-detecting camera traps to examine
   spatial and temporal patterns of meso- and apex predator occupancy and
   activity in a fragmented landscape in California. We hypothesized that
   both spatial and temporal partitioning among the carnivore guild would
   be affected by varied levels of human influence. We found that higher
   residential development reduced puma occupancy but was not related to
   the occupancy of mesopredators. Bobcats, grey foxes, and Virginia
   opossums were detected more often at sites occupied by pumas, whereas
   coyotes and raccoons were detected less often. The detection
   probabilities of smaller mesopredators were related to coyotes, a
   dominant mesopredator, but the magnitude and direction of these
   correlations differed depending upon puma occupancy. We also found that
   species altered their activities temporally in locations with higher
   human use, with pumas, bobcats and coyotes reducing diurnal activities
   and increasing nocturnal ones. These activity shifts were reflected in
   reduced temporal partitioning between intraguild competitors, with
   unknown effects on species interactions and repercussions to the prey
   community. Our results suggest that human development and activity
   alters predator community structure through both direct and indirect
   pathways. Therefore effective carnivore conservation requires an
   understanding of how mesopredators respond to varying levels of apex
   predator and anthropogenic influences. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Title = {Monitoring, imperfect detection, and risk optimization of a Tasmanian
   devil insurance population},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {267-275},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Most species are imperfectly detected during biological surveys, which
   creates uncertainty around their abundance or presence at a given
   location. Decision makers managing threatened or pest species are
   regularly faced with this uncertainty. Wildlife diseases can drive
   species to extinction; thus, managing species with disease is an
   important part of conservation. Devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) is one
   such disease that led to the listing of the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus
   harrisii) as endangered. Managers aim to maintain devils in the wild by
   establishing disease-free insurance populations at isolated sites. Often
   a resident DFTD-affected population must first be removed. In a
   successful collaboration between decision scientists and wildlife
   managers, we used an accessible population model to inform monitoring
   decisions and facilitate the establishment of an insurance population of
   devils on Forestier Peninsula. We used a Bayesian catch-effort model to
   estimate population size of a diseased population from removal and
   camera trap data. We also analyzed the costs and benefits of declaring
   the area disease-free prior to reintroduction and establishment of a
   healthy insurance population. After the monitoring session in May-June
   2015, the probability that all devils had been successfully removed was
   close to 1, even when we accounted for a possible introduction of a
   devil to the site. Given this high probability and the baseline cost of
   declaring population absence prematurely, we found it was not
   cost-effective to carry out any additional monitoring before introducing
   the insurance population. Considering these results within the broader
   context of Tasmanian devil management, managers ultimately decided to
   implement an additional monitoring session before the introduction. This
   was a conservative decision that accounted for uncertainty in model
   estimates and for the broader nonmonetary costs of mistakenly declaring
   the area disease-free.},

Title = {Equivalency of Galapagos Giant Tortoises Used as Ecological Replacement
   Species to Restore Ecosystem Functions},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {701-709},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Loss of key plant-animal interactions (e.g., disturbance, seed
   dispersal, and herbivory) due to extinctions of large herbivores has
   diminished ecosystem functioning nearly worldwide. Mitigating for the
   ecological consequences of large herbivore losses through the use of
   ecological replacements to fill extinct species' niches and thereby
   replicate missing ecological functions has been proposed. It is unknown
   how different morphologically and ecologically a replacement can be from
   the extinct species and still provide similar functions. We studied
   niche equivalency between 2 phenotypes of Galapagos giant tortoises
   (domed and saddlebacked) that were translocated to Pinta Island in the
   Galapagos Archipelago as ecological replacements for the extinct
   saddlebacked giant tortoise (Chelonoidis abingdonii). Thirty-nine adult,
   nonreproductive tortoises were introduced to Pinta Island in May 2010,
   and we observed tortoise resource use in relation to phenotype during
   the first year following release. Domed tortoises settled in higher,
   moister elevations than saddlebacked tortoises, which favored lower
   elevation arid zones. The areas where the tortoises settled are
   consistent with the ecological conditions each phenotype occupies in its
   native range. Saddlebacked tortoises selected areas with high densities
   of the arboreal prickly pear cactus (Opuntia galapageia) and mostly
   foraged on the cactus, which likely relied on the extinct saddlebacked
   Pinta tortoise for seed dispersal. In contrast, domed tortoises did not
   select areas with cactus and therefore would not provide the same
   seed-dispersal functions for the cactus as the introduced or the
   original, now extinct, saddlebacked tortoises. Interchangeability of
   extant megaherbivores as replacements for extinct forms therefore should
   be scrutinized given the lack of equivalency we observed in closely
   related forms of giant tortoises. Our results also demonstrate the value
   of trial introductions of sterilized individuals to test niche
   equivalency among candidate analog species.},

Title = {Occupancy patterns and niche partitioning within a diverse carnivore
   community exposed to anthropogenic pressures},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {301-312},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Although carnivores are in global decline, diverse carnivore communities
   are common in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 20 species may
   co-occur. Though intraguild competition and predation can limit the set
   of species that coexist, most carnivores have traits that decrease the
   impacts of interspecific competition on fitness, a pattern that promotes
   coexistence. An increasing human population and demand for natural
   resources (e.g. farming) has fragmented landscapes, reduced available
   prey, and elevated rates of conflict. These anthropogenic pressures tend
   to eliminate large carnivores first, which can have cascading effects on
   ecosystem function (e.g. mesopredator release). Anthropogenic pressures
   might also affect mesocarnivores directly, but this hypothesis has
   received little research attention to date. Here, we used camera surveys
   to describe spatial and temporal patterns of carnivore occupancy in a
   mixed-use landscape in Kenya. This landscape included a community
   conservation area and seasonally occupied human settlement and livestock
   grazing areas. We detected 21 carnivore species and examined occupancy
   patterns for the 12 most frequently detected. Differences among species
   in responses to environmental conditions supported a hypothesis of
   spatial niche partitioning. Differences in the temporal activity
   patterns of the apex predators and mesocarnivores supported a hypothesis
   of temporal niche partitioning. Human land use altered occupancy
   patterns in 10 of 12 species. Apex predator occupancies were lower in
   more anthropogenically disturbed areas, but mesocarnivore occupancies
   were not inversely related to apex predators, contrary to the
   mesopredator release hypothesis. Our results suggest that a diverse
   carnivore community persists in this mixed use landscape because of
   seasonal variation in human land use. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Source-sink dynamics promote wolf persistence in human-modified
   landscapes: Insights from long-term monitoring},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {256},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Long-term monitoring studies assessing wolf population dynamics are
   scarce, particularly in human-dominated landscapes of southern Europe.
   In this work, we estimate wolf demographic parameters in northwest
   Portugal based on a multi-methodological approach over 20 years split
   into two periods (period A: 1996?2005; period B: 2007?2016). Period B
   takes advantage of methodological upgrades in wolf surveys, as GPS
   telemetry and the use of genetic noninvasive samples, to report
   dispersal events and identify core and sink packs. The average annual
   population size was 27.0 ? 2.1 (SE; range 13?43) individuals, with 2 to
   6 annual packs and an average density of 1.7 ? 0.1 wolves/100km2. The
   population showed a growth rate of 4.2 ? 7.6\%, with a decreasing trend
   (period A, -8 ? 9\%) followed by a recovery (period B, 16 ? 11\%),
   mainly due to local extinction and reestablishment of sink packs. The
   average pack size was 6.2 ? 0.3 individuals, with a maximum of 16
   individuals, the highest reported value for Iberian wolves. During
   period B, the percentage of dispersers detected in this population was
   11\% and the average dispersal distance was 24.8 ? 1.2 km. Core packs
   showed higher group persistence, breeding success, and average pack
   sizes compared with sink packs. Results suggest a source-sink dynamics
   in this population, with few core packs promoting the maintenance and
   recovery of sink packs through a steppingstone process. Our findings
   provide a comprehensive overview of wolf population dynamics in
   human-dominated landscapes and reinforce that wolf management and
   conservation planning should take into consideration population trends
   based on long-term studies, and spatial dynamics of demographic traits
   across packs.},

Abstract = {As large carnivores recover throughout Europe, their distribution needs
   to be studied to determine their conservation status and assess the
   potential for human-carnivore conflicts. However, efficient monitoring
   of many large carnivore species is challenging due to their rarity,
   elusive behavior, and large home ranges. Their monitoring can include
   opportunistic sightings from citizens in addition to designed surveys.
   Two types of detection errors may occur in such monitoring schemes:
   false negatives and false positives. False-negative detections can be
   accounted for in species distribution models (SDMs) that deal with
   imperfect detection. False-positive detections, due to species
   misidentification, have rarely been accounted for in SDMs. Generally,
   researchers use ad hoc data-filtering methods to discard ambiguous
   observations prior to analysis. These practices may discard valuable
   ecological information on the distribution of a species. We investigated
   the costs and benefits of including data types that may include false
   positives rather than discarding them for SDMs of large carnivores. We
   used a dynamic occupancy model that simultaneously accounts for false
   negatives and positives to jointly analyze data that included both
   unambiguous detections and ambiguous detections. We used simulations to
   compare the performances of our model with a model fitted on unambiguous
   data only. We tested the 2 models in 4 scenarios in which parameters
   that control false-positive detections and true detections varied. We
   applied our model to data from the monitoring of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx
   lynx) in the European Alps. The addition of ambiguous detections
   increased the precision of parameter estimates. For the Eurasian lynx,
   incorporating ambiguous detections produced more precise estimates of
   the ecological parameters and revealed additional occupied sites in
   areas where the species is likely expanding. Overall, we found that
   ambiguous data should be considered when studying the distribution of
   large carnivores through the use of dynamic occupancy models that
   account for misidentification.},

Title = {Sea ice loss increases genetic isolation in a high Arctic ungulate
   metapopulation},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Sea ice loss may have dramatic consequences for population connectivity,
   extinction-colonization dynamics, and even the persistence of Arctic
   species subject to climate change. This is of particular concern in face
   of additional anthropogenic stressors, such as overexploitation. In this
   study, we assess the population-genetic implications of diminishing sea
   ice cover in the endemic, high Arctic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer
   tarandus platyrhynchus) by analyzing the interactive effects of
   landscape barriers and reintroductions (following harvest-induced
   extirpations) on their metapopulation genetic structure. We genotyped
   411 wild reindeer from 25 sampling sites throughout the entire
   subspecies' range at 19 microsatellite loci. Bayesian clustering
   analysis showed a genetic structure composed of eight populations, of
   which two were admixed. Overall population genetic differentiation was
   high (mean F-ST = 0.21). Genetic diversity was low (allelic richness
   {[}AR] = 2.07-2.58; observed heterozygosity = 0.23-0.43) and declined
   toward the outer distribution range, where populations showed
   significant levels of inbreeding. Coalescent estimates of effective
   population sizes and migration rates revealed strong evolutionary
   source-sink dynamics with the central population as the main source. The
   population genetic structure was best explained by a landscape genetics
   model combining strong isolation by glaciers and open water, and high
   connectivity by dispersal across winter sea ice. However, the observed
   patterns of natural isolation were strongly modified by the signature of
   past harvest-induced extirpations, subsequent reintroductions, and
   recent lack of sea ice. These results suggest that past and current
   anthropogenic drivers of metapopulation dynamics may have interactive
   effects on large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes. Continued
   loss of sea ice as a dispersal corridor within and between island
   systems is expected to increase the genetic isolation of populations,
   and thus threaten the evolutionary potential and persistence of Arctic
   wildlife.},

Title = {Assessing the relative importance of landscape and husbandry factors in
   determining large carnivore depredation risk in Tanzania's Ruaha
   landscape},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {180},
Pages = {241-248},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tanzania's Ruaha landscape, centred around Ruaha National Park (RNP), is
   an international priority area for large carnivores, supporting >10\% of
   the world's lions (Panthera leo) and globally significant populations of
   leopards (Panthera pardus), spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) and other
   carnivores. However, Ruaha's carnivore populations cause intense
   conflict with local people, mainly due to livestock depredation, and are
   exposed to alarming rates of retaliatory killing, especially on village
   land adjacent to RNP. Depredation risk is likely to be influenced by
   both habitat features and livestock husbandry, but the specific
   environmental risk factors, and relative importance of habitat and
   husbandry, have never been assessed in this landscape. Here, we assessed
   which ecogeographic variables (EGVs) were associated with depredation
   risk for grazing livestock on village land, and generated a predictive
   map of large carnivore predation risk, based on species distribution
   modelling algorithms (SDMs). Secondly, we investigated the relative
   influence of husbandry and EGVs on depredation risk of enclosed stock,
   based on a generalized linear model. Grazing livestock predation risk
   was higher closer to rivers, and in areas of lower elevation and low
   percentage of tree cover, with 41\% of the area mapped as high-risk. For
   enclosed stock, predation risk was mostly influenced by low percentage
   of tree cover and increased rainfall, with no discernible influence of
   current husbandry, which suggests that traditional husbandry was
   insufficient to outweigh the innate predation risks associated with
   high-risk landscape areas. Adopting new husbandry methods, such as
   specialised guarding dogs and fortified livestock enclosures, could be
   valuable for reducing depredation and carnivore killing in the Ruaha
   landscape. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Analyzing Disease Risks Associated with Translocations},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {442-452},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Translocations of species are expected to be used increasingly to
   counter the undesirable effects of anthropogenic changes to ecosystems,
   including loss of species. Methods to assess the risk of disease
   associated with translocations have been compiled in a comprehensive
   manual of disease-risk analysis for movement of domestic animals. We
   used this manual to devise a qualitative method for assessing the
   probability of the occurrence of disease in wild animals associated with
   translocations. We adapted the method such that we considered a parasite
   (any agent of infectious or noninfectious disease) a hazard if it or the
   host had crossed an ecological or geographical barrier and was novel to
   the host. We included in our analyses hazards present throughout the
   translocation pathway derived from the interactions between host
   immunity and the parasite, the effect of parasites on populations, the
   effect of noninfectious disease agents, and the effect of stressors on
   hostparasite interactions. We used the reintroduction of Eurasian Cranes
   (Grus grus) to England to demonstrate our method. Of the 24 hazards
   identified, 1 was classified as high risk (coccidia) and 5 were medium
   risk (highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, Mycobacterium avium,
   Aspergillus fumigatus, tracheal worms {[}Syngamus sp. and Cyathostoma
   sp.], and Tetrameres spp.). Seventeen other hazards were considered low
   or very low risk. In the absence of better information on the number,
   identity, distribution, and pathogenicity of parasites of wild animals,
   there is uncertainty in the risk of disease to translocated animals and
   recipient populations. Surveys of parasites in source and destination
   populations and detailed health monitoring after release will improve
   the information available for future analyses of disease risk. We
   believe our method can be adapted to assess the risks of disease in
   other translocated populations.},

Abstract = {Although the role of livestock in future food systems is debated, animal
   proteins are unlikely to completely disappear from our diet. Grasslands
   are a key source of primary productivity for livestock, and feed-food
   competition is often limited on such land. Previous research on the
   potential for sustainable grazing has focused on restricted geographical
   areas or does not consider inter-annual changes in grazing
   opportunities. Here, we developed a robust method to estimate trends and
   interannual variability (IV) in global livestock carrying capacity
   (number of grazing animals a piece of land can support) over 2001-2015,
   as well as relative stocking density (the reported livestock
   distribution relative to the estimated carrying capacity {[}CC]) in
   2010. We first estimated the aboveground biomass that is available for
   grazers on global grasslands based on the MODIS Net Primary Production
   product. This was then used to calculate livestock carrying capacities
   using slopes, forest cover, and animal forage requirements as
   restrictions. We found that globally, CC decreased on 27\% of total
   grasslands area, mostly in Europe and southeastern Brazil, while it
   increased on 15\% of grasslands, particularly in Sudano-Sahel and some
   parts of South America. In 2010, livestock forage requirements exceeded
   forage availability in northwestern Europe, and southern and eastern
   Asia. Although our findings imply some opportunities to increase grazing
   pressures in cold regions, Central Africa, and Australia, the high IV or
   low biomass supply might prevent considerable increases in stocking
   densities. The approach and derived open access data sets can feed into
   global food system modelling, support conservation efforts to reduce
   land degradation associated with overgrazing, and help identify
   undergrazed areas for targeted sustainable intensification efforts or
   rewilding purposes.},

Title = {Projecting demographic responses to climate change: adult and juvenile
   survival respond differently to direct and indirect effects of weather
   in a passerine population},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},

Volume = {19},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Few studies have quantitatively projected changes in demography in
   response to climate change, yet doing so can provide important insights
   into the processes that may lead to population declines and changes in
   species distributions. Using a long-term mark-recapture data set, we
   examined the influence of multiple direct and indirect effects of
   weather on adult and juvenile survival for a population of Song Sparrows
   (Melospiza melodia) in California. We found evidence for a positive,
   direct effect of winter temperature on adult survival, and a positive,
   indirect effect of prior rainy season precipitation on juvenile
   survival, which was consistent with an effect of precipitation on food
   availability during the breeding season. We used these relationships,
   and climate projections of significantly warmer and slightly drier
   winter weather by the year 2100, to project a significant increase in
   mean adult survival (12-17\%) and a slight decrease in mean juvenile
   survival (4-6\%) under the B1 and A2 climate change scenarios. Together
   with results from previous studies on seasonal fecundity and
   postfledging survival in this population, we integrated these results in
   a population model and projected increases in the population growth rate
   under both climate change scenarios. Our results underscore the
   importance of considering multiple, direct, and indirect effects of
   weather throughout the annual cycle, as well as differences in the
   responses of each life stage to climate change. Projecting demographic
   responses to climate change can identify not only how populations will
   be affected by climate change but also indicate the demographic
   process(es) and specific mechanisms that may be responsible. This
   information can, in turn, inform climate change adaptation plans, help
   prioritize future research, and identify where limited conservation
   resources will be most effectively and efficiently spent.},

Title = {Efficacy of road removal for restoring wildlife habitat: Black bear in
   the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA},

Abstract = {Forest roads reduce habitat quality for wildlife, in part by increasing
   susceptibility to hunting and poaching. Road removal is an increasingly
   common strategy for restoring habitat; however, little is known about
   responses of wildlife to road removal versus other methods of road
   closure. We assessed effects of different types of road closure (gated,
   barriered, and recontoured) on black bear (Ursus americanus) frequency
   and habitat on 18 open and closed road pairs in the western USA. Over 4
   years, 44 bears were photographed during 3545 camera-trap days. Bear
   frequency was significantly higher (2.4 versus 0.6/100 days,
   respectively) and human frequency was significantly lower (2.4 versus
   361.6/100 days, respectively) on closed than on open roads.
   Additionally, abundance of fall foods was higher (23.9\% and 12.8\%,
   respectively) and line-of-sight (a measure of habitat security) shorter
   (54.9 versus 69.4 m, respectively) on closed compared to open roads.
   Bears were detected on closed but not on open roads during daytime,
   suggesting avoidance of humans. Among-road-treatment differences
   included significantly higher frequency of bears on recontoured than on
   gated or barriered roads (4.6, 1.6, and 0.5/100 days, respectively), and
   significantly higher cover of fall bear foods on recontoured than on
   gated or barriered roads (39.3\%, 12.1\% and 16.4\%, respectively).
   Frequency of bears was negatively correlated with frequency of humans
   and line-of-sight distance and positively correlated with abundance of
   fall foods and hiding cover. Results suggest that while all types of
   road closure benefit sensitive wildlife, removal by recontour may be the
   most effective strategy for restoring habitat. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Non-native plants rarely provide suitable habitat for native
   gall-inducing species},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2797-2805},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {For insect herbivores, a critical niche requirement-possibly the
   critical niche requirement-is the presence of suitable host plants.
   Current research suggests that non-native plants are not as suitable as
   native plants for native herbivores, resulting in decreases in insect
   abundance and richness on non-native plants. Like herbivores,
   gall-forming insects engage in complex, species-specific interactions
   with host plants. Galls are plant tissue tumors (including bulbous or
   spindle-shaped protrusions on leaves, stems and other plant organs) that
   are induced by insects through physical or chemical damage (prompting
   plants to grow a protective tissue shell around the insect eggs and
   larvae). As such, we hypothesized that gall-inducing insect species
   richness would be higher on native than non-native plants. We also
   predicted higher gall-inducing insect species richness on woody than
   herbaceous plants. We used an extensive literature review in which we
   compiled gall host plant species by genus, and we assigned native or
   non-native (or mixed) status to each genus. We found that native plants
   host far more gall-inducing insect species than non-native plants; woody
   plants host more gall-inducing species than herbaceous plants; and
   native woody plants host the most gall-inducing species of all.
   Gall-inducing species generally are a very cryptic group, even for
   experts, and hence do not elicit the conservation efforts of more
   charismatic insects such as plant pollinators. Our results suggest that
   non-native plants, particularly non-native woody species, diminish
   suitable habitat for gall-inducing species in parallel with similar
   results found for other herbivores, such as Lepidopterans. Hence, the
   landscape-level replacement of native with non-native species,
   particularly woody ones, degrades taxonomically diverse gall-inducing
   species (and their inquilines and parasitoids), removing multiple layers
   of diversity from forest ecosystems.},

Title = {Regional-scale modelling of the cumulative impact of wind farms on bats},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {22},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1821-1835},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Wind farms are steadily growing across Europe, with potentially
   detrimental effects on wildlife. Indeed, cumulative impacts in addition
   to local effects should be considered when planning wind farm
   development at a regional scale, and mapping the potential risk to bats
   at this scale would help in the large-scale planning of wind turbines
   and focus field surveys on vulnerable areas. Although modelling offers a
   powerful approach to tackle this goal, its application has been thus far
   neglected. We developed a simple regional-scale analysis in an area of
   central Italy (Molise region) that is undergoing considerable wind farm
   development. We implemented species distribution models (SDMs) for two
   bat species vulnerable to wind farm impact, Nyctalus leisleri and
   Pipistrellus pipistrellus. We developed risk maps by overlaying SDMs for
   the two species with turbine locations, assessed the alteration of the
   landscape patterns of foraging habitat patches determined by the wind
   turbines, and identified highly vulnerable areas where wind farm
   construction would be particularly risky. SDMs were statistically robust
   (AUC a parts per thousand yen0.8 for both species) and revealed that 41
   \% of the region offers suitable foraging habitat for both species.
   These areas host over 50 \% of the existing or planned wind farms, with
   21 \% of the turbines located within 150 m of forest edges, suggesting
   an increase in fatality risk. The alterations in suitable foraging
   patches consisted of a 7.7 \% increase in the number of patches, a 10.7
   \% increase in the shape index, and a 8.1 \% decrease in the mean patch
   area. The region's western portion, which is most suitable to both
   species, requires careful consideration with regard to future wind farm
   planning.},

   such as habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and illegal trade,
   others have adapted to human-dominated landscapes. Information about
   Neotropical carnivore communities in particular is limited, especially
   in disturbed landscapes. We conducted a camera trap survey at 38 sites
   across the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor in Costa Rica to assess
   occupancy and detection probabilities of the carnivore community. We
   developed hypotheses within a likelihood-based framework in order to
   determine the landscape features and species traits (diet and size) that
   influenced their occupancy. We detected nine of the 13 native carnivores
   predicted to occur in the corridor. When modeled separately, each
   species responded to land cover changes differently, suggesting no
   strong community-wide predictors of occupancy. We then modeled three
   separate guilds within the carnivore community: omnivorous
   mesopredators, obligate carnivorous mesopredators, and apex predators.
   These community guild models revealed a negative relationship between
   omnivorous mesopredators and increasing forest and tree plantation
   cover, suggesting omnivores utilize forest fragments and edge habitats
   in agricultural landscapes. Obligate carnivorous mesopredator models did
   not reveal any strong habitat relationships, but landscape effects
   tended to contradict our a priori predictions. Apex predators were
   positively associated with increasing forest and tree plantation cover,
   protected areas, and increasing distances to villages. Alarmingly, apex
   predators and obligate carnivorous mesopredators were generally rare
   within the biological corridor. A lack of top-down control alone might
   result in heightened occupancy for all mesopredators, but because the
   community is dominated by omnivorous species, bottom-up release from
   human-induced land cover changes and resource provision may better
   explain their high occupancy.},

Title = {Predicting shifts in parasite distribution with climate change: a

Abstract = {Climate change likely will lead to increasingly favourable environmental
   conditions for many parasites. However, predictions regarding
   parasitism's impacts often fail to account for the likely variability in
   host distribution and how this may alter parasite occurrence. Here, we
   investigate potential distributional shifts in the meningeal worm,
   Parelaphostrongylosis tenuis, a protostrongylid nematode commonly found
   in white-tailed deer in North America, whose life cycle also involves a
   free-living stage and a gastropod intermediate host. We modelled the
   distribution of the hosts and free-living larva as a complete assemblage
   to assess whether a complex trophic system will lead to an overall
   increase in parasite distribution with climate change, or whether
   divergent environmental niches may promote an ecological mismatch. Using
   an ensemble approach to climate modelling under two different carbon
   emission scenarios, we show that whereas the overall trend is for an
   increase in niche breadth for each species, mismatches arise in habitat
   suitability of the free-living larva vs. the definitive and intermediate
   hosts. By incorporating these projected mismatches into a combined
   model, we project a shift in parasite distribution accounting for all
   steps in the transmission cycle, and identify that overall habitat
   suitability of the parasite will decline in the Great Plains and
   southeastern USA, but will increase in the Boreal Forest ecoregion,
   particularly in Alberta. These results have important implications for
   wildlife conservation and management due to the known pathogenicity of
   parelaphostrongylosis to alternate hosts including moose, caribou and
   elk. Our results suggest that disease risk forecasts which fail to
   consider biotic interactions may be overly simplistic, and that
   accounting for each of the parasite's life stages is key to refining
   predicted responses to climate change.},

Title = {Using Parasitic Trematode Larvae to Quantify an Elusive Vertebrate Host},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-93},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Digenean trematode parasites require multiple host species to complete
   their life cycles, and their abundance can often be strongly correlated
   with the abundance of their host species. Species richness and abundance
   of parasites in easily sampled host species may yield an accurate
   estimate of the species richness and abundance of other hosts in a
   parasite's life cycle that are difficult to survey directly.
   Accordingly, we investigated whether prevalence and mean abundance of
   trematodes could be used to estimate the abundance of one of their host
   species, diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin), which are
   difficult to sample and are designated as near threatened (by the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature {[}IUCN Red List]) along
   some U.S. coasts. As an adult the trematode Pleurogonius malaclemys is
   specific to terrapins. Its larval stages live first inside mud snails
   (Ilyanassa obsoleta) and are subsequently shed into the environment
   where they form external metacercarial cysts on hard surfaces such as
   snail opercula. The life cycle of P. malaclemys is completed when
   terrapins ingest these cysts. At 12 sites along the coast of Georgia
   (U.S.A.), we determined the prevalence of internal P. malaclemys larvae
   in mud snails (proportion of infected snails in a population) and the
   prevalence and mean abundance of external trematode cysts. We examined
   whether these data were correlated with terrapin abundance, which we
   estimated with mark-recapture methods. The abundance of external cysts
   and salinity explained >= 59\% of the variability in terrapin abundance.
   We suggest that dependent linkages between the life stages of multihost
   parasites make them reliable predictors of host species' abundance,
   including hosts with abundances that are challenging to quantify
   directly.},

Abstract = {The influence of climate change on wildlife disease dynamics is a
   burgeoning conservation and human health issue, but few long-term
   studies empirically link climate to pathogen prevalence. Polar bears
   (Ursus maritimus) are vulnerable to the negative impacts of sea ice loss
   as a result of accelerated Arctic warming. While studies have associated
   changes in polar bear body condition, reproductive output, survival, and
   abundance to reductions in sea ice, no long-term studies have documented
   the impact of climate change on pathogen exposure. We examined 425 serum
   samples from 381 adult polar bears, collected in western Hudson Bay
   (WH), Canada, for antibodies to selected pathogens across three time
   periods: 1986-1989 (n = 157), 1995-1998 (n = 159) and 2015-2017 (n =
   109). We ran serological assays for antibodies to seven pathogens:
   Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Trichinella spp., Francisella
   tularensis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine morbillivirus (CDV) and
   canine parvovirus (CPV). Seroprevalence of zoonotic parasites (T.
   gondii, Trichinella spp.) and bacterial pathogens (F. tularensis, B.
   bronchiseptica) increased significantly between 1986-1989 and 1995-1998,
   ranging from +6.2\% to +20.8\%, with T. gondii continuing to increase
   into 2015-2017 (+25.8\% overall). Seroprevalence of viral pathogens
   (CDV, CPV) and N. caninum did not change with time. Toxoplasma gondii
   seroprevalence was higher following wetter summers, while
   seroprevalences of Trichinella spp. and B. bronchiseptica were
   positively correlated with hotter summers. Seroprevalence of antibodies
   to F. tularensis increased following years polar bears spent more days
   on land, and polar bears previously captured in human settlements were
   more likely to be seropositive for Trichinella spp. As the Arctic has
   warmed due to climate change, zoonotic pathogen exposure in WH polar
   bears has increased, driven by numerous altered ecosystem pathways.},

Abstract = {Species conservation in a rapidly changing world requires an improved
   understanding of how individuals and populations respond to changes in
   their environment across temporal scales. Increased warming in the
   Arctic puts this region at particular risk for rapid environmental
   change, with potentially devastating impacts on resident populations.
   Here, we make use of a parameterized full life cycle, individual-based
   energy budget model for wild muskoxen, coupling year-round environmental
   data with detailed ontogenic metabolic physiology. We show how winter
   food accessibility, summer food availability, and density dependence
   drive seasonal dynamics of energy storage and thus life history and
   population dynamics. Winter forage accessibility defined by snow depth,
   more than summer forage availability, was the primary determinant of
   muskox population dynamics through impacts on calf recruitment and
   longer term carryover effects of maternal investment. Simulations of
   various seasonal snow depth and plant biomass and quality profiles
   revealed that timing of and improved/limited winter forage accessibility
   had marked influence on calf recruitment (+/- 10-80\%). Impacts on
   recruitment were the cumulative result of condition-driven reproductive
   performance at multiple time points across the reproductive period
   (ovulation to calf weaning) as a trade-off between survival and
   reproduction. Seasonal and generational condition effects of snow-rich
   winters interacted with age structure and density to cause pronounced
   long-term consequences on population growth and structure, with
   predicted population recovery times from even moderate disturbances of
   10 years or more. Our results show how alteration in winter forage
   accessibility, mediated by snow depth, impacts the dynamics of northern
   herbivore populations. Further, we present here a mechanistic and
   state-based model framework to assess future scenarios of environmental
   change, such as increased or decreased snowfall or plant biomass and
   quality to impact winter and summer forage availability across the
   Arctic.},

   plantation forest. C. tuberculatus roost within the oldest stands in
   plantation forest so it was likely roost availability would decrease as
   harvest operations occurred. We predicted that post-harvest: (1)
   roosting range sizes would be smaller, (2) fewer roosts would be used,
   and (3) colony size would be smaller. We captured and radiotracked C.
   tuberculatus to day-roosts in Kinleith Forest, an exotic plantation
   forest, over three southern hemisphere summers (Season 1 October
   2006-March 2007; Season 2 November 2007-March 2008; and Season 3
   November 2008-March 2009). Individual roosting ranges (100\% MCPs) post
   harvest were smaller than those in areas that had not been harvested,
   and declined in area during the 3 years. Following harvest, bats used
   fewer roosts than those in areas that had not been harvested. Over 3
   years 20.7\% of known roosts were lost: 14.5\% due to forestry
   operations and 6.2\% due to natural tree fall. Median colony size was
   4.0 bats (IQR = 2.0-8.0) and declined during the study, probably because
   of locally high levels of roost loss. Post harvest colonies were smaller
   than colonies in areas that had not been harvested. Together, these
   results suggest the impact of clear-fell harvest on long-tailed bat
   populations is negative.},

Title = {Depredation of domestic herds by pumas based on farmer's information in
   Southern Brazil},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Background: Large carnivores such as pumas are frequently killed due to
   conflicts with human populations involving predation on domestic herds.
   In Southern Brazil, traditional pasture systems, where animals feed
   without specific husbandry practices is typical, becoming the herds
   vulnerable to puma attacks. The aim of this study was to examine the
   conflict between local people and pumas in a Protected Areas mosaic in
   southern Brazil.
   Methods: Forty-five face-to-face interviews with local people were
   performed during the year of 2011, using a structured questionnaire with
   open and closed questions about puma attack episodes in some farms.
   Based on responses, the conflict and puma attacks were described, and
   the characteristics of attacked farms and estimated financial losses
   were evaluated. The first respondents were indicated by the Local
   Environmental Agency, and the others were indicated by the first one and
   so on, which is known as ``snow-ball{''} method.
   Results: Our data suggested that pumas used to attack in unfavorable
   conditions of visibility (foggy days) and on easier prey (e.g. sheep).
   Most of the attacks reported were close to forested areas and were
   focused on free herds during feeding activities. Some farmers said they
   gave up their sheep breeding activity due to losses caused by puma
   attacks. However, some farmers could over estimate their losses.
   Moreover, pumas were considered a threat to domestic herds and
   respondents mentioned cases of illegal puma hunting in the area. The
   results of questionnaires suggested that puma attack episodes were
   related to fragmentation of their habitat associated to incorrect
   management of herds in the farms studied. The diagnosis of this type of
   conflict and the characterization of most attacked sites are extremely
   important to create strategies to prevent and control attacks by wild
   carnivores.
   Conclusions: Deep changes in husbandry practices added to educational
   programs should be implemented, in order to maintain the sustainability
   of rural activities as well as the survival of pumas in southern Brazil.},

Title = {Development and validation of protein biomarkers of health in grizzly
   bears},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Large carnivores play critical roles in the maintenance and function of
   natural ecosystems; however, the populations of many of these species
   are in decline across the globe. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
   develop novel techniques that can be used as sensitive conservation
   tools to detect new threats to the health of individual animals well in
   advance of population-level effects. Our study aimed to determine the
   expression of proteins related to energetics, reproduction and stress in
   the skin of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) using a liquid chromatography
   and multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry assay. We
   hypothesized that a suite of target proteins could be measured using
   this technique and that the expression of these proteins would be
   associated with biological (sex, age, sample location on body) and
   environmental (geographic area, season, sample year) variables. Small
   skin biopsies were collected from free-ranging grizzly bears in Alberta,
   Canada, from 2013 to 2019 (n = 136 samples from 111 individuals). Over
   700 proteins were detected in the skin of grizzly bears, 19 of which
   were chosen as targets because of their established roles in
   physiological function. Generalized linear mixed model analysis was used
   for each target protein. Results indicate that sample year influenced
   the majority of proteins, suggesting that physiological changes may be
   driven in part by responses to changes in the environment. Season
   influenced the expression of proteins related to energetics,
   reproduction and stress, all of which were lower during fall compared to
   early spring. The expression of proteins related to energetics and
   stress varied by geographic area, while the majority of proteins that
   were affected by biological attributes (age class, sex and age class by
   sex interaction) were related to reproduction and stress. This study
   provides a novel method by which scientists and managers can further
   assess and monitor physiological function in wildlife.},

Title = {Emergence of Mong La on the Myanmar-China border as a global hub for the
   international trade in ivory and elephant parts},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {179},
Pages = {17-22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We report on the illegal trade in ivory and elephant parts in the
   Special Development Zone of Mong La, Shan State, Myanmar, on the border
   with China. Mong La caters exclusively for the Chinese market and is
   best described as a Chinese enclave in Myanmar. We surveyed the morning
   market, shops and hotels in February 2006, February 2009 and December
   2013-January 2014. Trade in body parts primarily concerned dried
   elephant skin (4 pieces in 2006, 278 in 2009 and 1238 in 2013-2014), and
   to a lesser extent molars and bones. We found 3494 pieces of carved
   ivory (none in 2006, 200 in 2009 and 3294 in 20132014) and 49 whole
   tusks (all in 2013-2014) openly for sale, suggesting Mong La has
   recently emerged as a significant hub of the ivory trade. The origin of
   the ivory may constitute a combination of Asian elephant ivory from
   Myanmar and African ivory imported via China. According to local sources
   the carving was done by Chinese craftsmen, in Mong La as well as across
   the border in China, and was largely, if not exclusively, intended for
   the internal Chinese market. Based on asking prices of the most commonly
   offered items the retail value of the ivory on display in Mong La during
   the 2013-2014 survey totals an estimated US\$1.2 million. Trade in
   elephant parts and elephant ivory is illegal in Myanmar and CITES I
   listing of elephants preclude international trade in therm Mong La is
   governed largely autonomously by an overlord and policed by an Eastern
   Shan State army. We urge both the Myanmar and Chinese governments to
   liaise with the Mong La rulers to curb the trade in ivory (and other
   high profile species), and recommend that the Myanmar and Chinese CITES
   authorities come together urgently as to resolve the illicit trade of
   ivory and elephant parts across their borders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {329-338},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Corridors are intended to increase species survival by abating landscape
   fragmentation resulting from the conversion of natural habitats into
   human-dominated matrices. Conservation scientists often rely on 1 type
   of corridor model, typically the least-cost model or current-flow model,
   to construct a linkage design, and their choice is not usually based on
   theory or empirical evidence. We developed a method to empirically
   confirm whether corridors produced by these 2 models are used by target
   species under current landscape conditions. We applied this method in
   the Gamba landscape between 2 national parks in southwestern Gabon. We
   collected signs of presence of African forest elephant (Loxodonta
   cyclotis), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), and 2 apes, western
   lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and central chimpanzee (Pan
   troglodytes troglodytes), on transects. We used patch-occupancy models
   to identify least-cost and current-flow corridors for these 4 species.
   On average, 28.7\% of current-flow corridors overlapped with least-cost
   corridors, confirming that the choice of corridor model can affect the
   location of the resulting linkage design. We validated these corridors
   by monitoring signs and examining camera detections on new transects
   within and outside modeled corridors. Current-flow corridors performed
   better than least-cost corridors for elephants, whereas the opposite was
   found for buffalo and apes. Locations of the highest priority corridors
   for the 3 taxa did not overlap, and only 18.3\% of their combined
   surface was common among 2 species. We used centrality metrics to
   calculate the average contribution of corridor pixels to landscape
   connectivity and derived an index that can be used to prioritize
   corridors. As a result, we recommend protecting at least 17.4\% of the
   land surface area around Gamba town to preserve the preferred travel
   routes of the target species.},

Title = {Factors affecting Eurasian lynx kill rates on semi-domestic reindeer in
   northern Scandinavia: Can ecological research contribute to the
   development of a fair compensation system?},

Abstract = {Semi-domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) are the main prey for lynx
   (Lynx lynx) in northern Scandinavia. This causes large, but poorly
   documented, losses of reindeer. Although the compensation schemes differ
   between Norway and Sweden, there is a legal requirement in both
   Scandinavian countries that losses of semi-domestic reindeer to large
   carnivores should be fully compensated. The current level of
   compensation payment is based on limited data on lynx kill rates on
   reindeer. The main goal of this study was to quantify lynx kill rates on
   reindeer across a range of ecological conditions in northern
   Scandinavia. A total of 35 lynx were monitored during 3667 days. All
   lynx individuals killed reindeer. However, we observed a high variation
   in individual kill rates. Kill rates were strongly affected by sex and
   social status (i.e. females with and without kittens), as well as season
   and reindeer availability. The highest kill rates were observed in
   summer for male lynx, and the lowest were observed during winter for
   solitary lynx at low reindeer density. In summer, several female lynx
   switched completely to small prey species even at high densities of
   reindeer. The present political goals for lynx conservation in
   Scandinavia require that lynx occur in the reindeer husbandry area where
   reindeer are the only suitable ungulate prey available. Accordingly, it
   is therefore impossible to have the total prevention of depredation as a
   management goal. Rather depredation levels must be limited such that
   they are considered acceptable, and fair compensation payments should be
   paid. Our study is the first empirical quantification of the magnitude
   of lynx depredation on semi-domestic reindeer. This is an important step
   necessary to enable the setting of fair compensation levels and will
   hopefully lead to a reduction in conflict level concerning the potential
   impacts that lynx have on reindeer. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Reliable monitoring of elephant populations in the forests of India:
   Analytical and practical considerations},

Abstract = {Reliable estimation of elephant population abundance and density assumes
   great importance in the context of massive threats from illegal hunting
   and habitat loss. However, available estimates of elephant populations,
   particularly in Asia, are often unreliable and misleading. We evaluate
   sources of bias and Imprecision in commonly used estimation approaches,
   and demonstrate that if correctly applied, line transect sampling based
   on visual detections of elephant clusters can address these issues. We
   compare our own early transect surveys on foot that relied on purposive
   line placement, to subsequent surveys in 2011, which employed rigorous
   survey designs. Estimated elephant density ((D) over cap (95\%C (I) over
   cap((D) over cap)) in our study sites in India, ranged between
   0.25(0.12-0.53) and 3.29(1.74-6.21) elephants/km(2) in the earlier
   surveys and between 0.32(0.14-0.75) and 2.24(1.41-3.56) elephants/km(2)
   in the 2011 survey. Although coefficients of variation of estimated
   detection probability ((p) over cap) and cluster size ((E) over cap (S))
   were higher at low sample sizes, they dropped to <15\% with n > 40
   detections. Variance of encounter rate (n/l) was the largest contributor
   to the variance of density estimates. We recommend that rigorous line
   transect surveys must ensure: random transect placement with systematic
   and sufficient spatial replication to ensure adequate spatial coverage;
   coverage of sufficiently large areas in a short duration to ensure
   population closure; and investment of adequate effort to ensure
   reasonable number of detections. Field and analytical protocols
   presented here can enable reliable estimation of density and abundance
   of other wildlife species that can be visually detected in forests. They
   can lead to improved animal monitoring programs that are central to
   rigorously evaluating the effectiveness of widely employed, expensive
   conservation interventions meant to counter massive anthropogenic
   threats facing elephants and other large, diurnal species. (C) 2015

Title = {Responses of seagrass to anthropogenic and natural disturbances do not

Abstract = {Coastal communities are under threat from many and often co-occurring
   local (e.g., pollution, eutrophication) and global stressors (e.g.,
   climate change), yet understanding the interactive and cumulative
   impacts of multiple stressors in ecosystem function is far from being
   accomplished. Ecological redundancy may be key for ecosystem resilience,
   but there are still many gaps in our understanding of interspecific
   differences within a functional group, particularly regarding response
   diversity, that is, whether members of a functional group respond
   equally or differently to anthropogenic stressors. Herbivores are
   critical in determining plant community structure and the transfer of
   energy up the food web. Human disturbances may alter the ecological role
   of herbivory by modifying the defense strategies of plants and thus the
   feeding patterns and performance of herbivores. We conducted a suite of
   experiments to examine the independent and interactive effects of
   anthropogenic (nutrient and CO2 additions) and natural (simulated
   herbivory) disturbances on a seagrass and its interaction with two
   common generalist consumers to understand how multiple disturbances can
   impact both a foundation species and a key ecological function
   (herbivory) and to assess the potential existence of response diversity
   to anthropogenic and natural changes in these systems. While all three
   disturbances modified seagrass defense traits, there were contrasting
   responses of herbivores to such plant changes. Both CO2 and nutrient
   additions influenced herbivore feeding behavior, yet while sea urchins
   preferred nutrient-enriched seagrass tissue (regardless of other
   experimental treatments), isopods were deterred by these same plant
   tissues. In contrast, carbon enrichment deterred sea urchins and
   attracted isopods, while simulated herbivory only influenced isopod
   feeding choice. These contrasting responses of herbivores to
   disturbance-induced changes in seagrass help to better understand the
   ecological functioning of seagrass ecosystems in the face of human
   disturbances and may have important implications regarding the
   resilience and conservation of these threatened ecosystems.},

Title = {Genetic divergence along a climate gradient shapes chemical plasticity
   of a foundation tree species to both changing climate and herbivore
   damage},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {15},
Pages = {4684-4700},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change is threatening the persistence of many tree species via
   independent and interactive effects on abiotic and biotic conditions. In
   addition, changes in temperature, precipitation, and insect attacks can
   alter the traits of these trees, disrupting communities and ecosystems.
   For foundation species such as Populus, phytochemical traits are key
   mechanisms linking trees with their environment and are likely jointly
   determined by interactive effects of genetic divergence and variable
   environments throughout their geographic range. Using reciprocal Fremont
   cottonwood (Populus fremontii) common gardens along a steep climatic
   gradient, we explored how environment (garden climate and simulated
   herbivore damage) and genetics (tree provenance and genotype) affect
   both foliar chemical traits and the plasticity of these traits. We found
   that (1) Constitutive and plastic chemical responses to changes in
   garden climate and damage varied among defense compounds, structural
   compounds, and leaf nitrogen. (2) For both defense and structural
   compounds, plastic responses to different garden climates depended on
   the climate in which a population or genotype originated. Specifically,
   trees originating from cool provenances showed higher defense plasticity
   in response to climate changes than trees from warmer provenances. (3)
   Trees from cool provenances growing in cool garden conditions expressed
   the lowest constitutive defense levels but the strongest induced
   (plastic) defenses in response to damage. (4) The combination of hot
   garden conditions and simulated herbivory switched the strategy used by
   these genotypes, increasing constitutive defenses but erasing the
   capacity for induction after damage. Because Fremont cottonwood
   chemistry plays a major role in shaping riparian communities and
   ecosystems, the effects of changes in phytochemical traits can be wide
   reaching. As the southwestern US is confronted with warming temperatures
   and insect outbreaks, these results improve our capacity to predict
   ecosystem consequences of climate change and inform selection of tree
   genotypes for conservation and restoration purposes.},

Title = {Contrasting responses of large carnivores to land use management across

Abstract = {Land-use change has led to substantial range contractions for many
   species. Such contractions are particularly acute for wide-ranging large
   carnivores in Asia's high altitude areas, which are marked by high
   spatiotemporal variability in resources. Current conservation planning
   for human-dominated landscapes often takes one of two main approaches: a
   ``coexistence{''} (land sharing) approach or a ``separation{''} (land
   sparing) approach. In this study, we evaluated the effects of land-use
   management on a guild of large carnivores in a montane ecosystem located
   in northeastern Iran. We used interview surveys to collect data on
   Persian leopard Panthera pardus saxicolor and grey wolf Canis lupus and
   modeled the areas occupied by these species in a Bayesian framework.
   After accounting for imperfect detection, we found that wolves had a
   higher probability of occupying the study area than leopards (82\%; 95\%
   CI 73-90\% vs. 63\%; 95\% CI 53-73\%). Importantly, each predator showed
   contrasting response to land-use management. National Parks (i.e.
   human-free areas) had a positive association with leopard occupancy
   (alpha(National Park) = 2.56, 95\% CI 0.22-5.77), in contrast to wolves,
   which displayed a negative association with National Parks
   (alpha(National Park) = - 1.62, 95\% CI - 2.29 to 0.31). An opposite
   pattern was observed for human-dominated areas (i.e. Protected Areas and
   Communal Lands), where occupancy was higher for wolves but lower for
   leopards. Our study suggests that to protect these large carnivores, a
   combination of land sharing and land sparing approaches is desirable
   within Iran montane landscapes. Any recovery program for big cats in
   Iranian mountains, and likely similar mountainous landscapes in west
   Asia, should take into account other sympatric carnivores and how they
   can affect adjacent human communities. For example, conflict mitigation
   and compensation efforts are required to include the guild of large
   carnivores, instead of solely targeting the charismatic big cats.},

Title = {Demographic Connectivity for Ursid Populations at Wildlife Crossing
   Structures in Banff National Park},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {721-730},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Wildlife crossing structures are one solution to mitigating the
   fragmentation of wildlife populations caused by roads, but their
   effectiveness in providing connectivity has only been superficially
   evaluated. Hundreds of grizzly (Ursus arctos) and black bear (Ursus
   americanus) passages through under and overpasses have been recorded in
   Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. However, the ability of crossing
   structures to allow individual and population-level movements across
   road networks remains unknown. In April 2006, we initiated a 3-year
   investigation into whether crossing structures provide demographic
   connectivity for grizzly and black bears in Banff National Park. We
   collected hair with multiple noninvasive methods to obtain genetic
   samples from grizzly and black bears around the Bow Valley. Our
   objectives were to determine the number of male and female grizzly and
   black bears that use crossing structures; examine spatial and temporal
   patterns of crossings; and estimate the proportions of grizzly and black
   bear populations in the Bow Valley that use crossing structures. Fifteen
   grizzly (7 female, 8 male) and 17 black bears (8 female, 9 male) used
   wildlife crossing structures. The number of individuals detected at
   wildlife crossing structures was highly correlated with the number of
   passages in space and time. Grizzly bears used open crossing structures
   (e.g., overpasses) more often than constricted crossings (e.g.,
   culverts). Peak use of crossing structures for both bear species
   occurred in July, when high rates of foraging activity coincide with
   mating season. We compared the number of bears that used crossings with
   estimates of population abundance from a related study and determined
   that substantial percentages of grizzly (15.0\% in 2006, 19.8\% in 2008)
   and black bear (17.6\% in 2006, 11.0\% in 2008) populations used
   crossing structures. On the basis of our results, we concluded wildlife
   crossing structures provide demographic connectivity for bear
   populations in Banff National Park.},

Title = {Impacts of heterogeneous host densities and contact rates on pathogen
   transmission in the Channel Island fox (Urocyon littoralis)},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {236},
Pages = {593-603},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Diseases threaten wildlife populations worldwide and have caused severe
   declines resulting in host species being listed as threatened or
   endangered. The risk of a widespread epidemic is especially high when
   pathogens are introduced to naive host populations, often leading to
   high morbidity and mortality. Prevention and control of these epidemics
   is based on knowledge of what drives pathogen transmission among hosts.
   Previous disease outbreaks suggest the spread of directly transmitted
   pathogens is determined by host contact rates and local host density.
   While theoretical models of disease spread typically assume a constant
   host density, most wildlife populations occur at a variety of densities
   across the landscape. We explored how spatial heterogeneity in host
   density influences pathogen spread by simulating the introduction and
   spread of rabies and canine distemper in a spatially heterogeneous
   population of Channel Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis), coupling fox
   density and contact rates with probabilities of viral transmission. For
   both diseases, the outcome of pathogen introductions varied widely among
   simulation iterations and depended on the density of hosts at the site
   of pathogen introduction. Introductions into areas of higher fox
   densities resulted in more rapid pathogen transmission and greater
   impact on the host population than if the pathogen was introduced at
   lower densities. Both pathogens were extirpated in a substantial
   fraction of iterations. Rabies was over five times more likely to go
   locally extinct when introduced at low host density sites than at high
   host-density sites, leaving an average of > 99\% of foxes uninfected.
   Canine distemper went extinct in > 98\% of iterations regardless of
   introduction site, but only after > 90\% of foxes had become infected.
   Our results highlight the difficulty in predicting the course of an
   epidemic, in part due to complex interactions between pathogen biology
   and host behavior, exacerbated by the spatial variation of most host
   populations.},

   wildlife telemetry},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Telemetry has revolutionized studies in wildlife biology, ecology,
   physiology, and conservation. With the increased demand for telemetry,
   new technology has made great strides to enable long studies in harsh
   and remote areas on a wide variety of study species. As the climate
   crisis continues to impact animals, temperature-sensing telemetry has
   become a helpful technique for understanding the effects of climate
   change and how to protect wildlife from them. However,
   temperature-sensing telemetry and telemetry in general still pose
   technological challenges and accessibility issues for the researchers
   who use it. Currently available telemetry technology is expensive, too
   large and heavy for many study species, and cannot measure all variables
   researchers want to study. These technological improvements have
   especially been neglected for temperature-sensing telemetry, which may
   be underutilized given the current climate crisis. To understand why
   innovation has stalled, and where it should be directed going forward,
   we gathered opinions from researchers who use telemetry and from
   manufacturers that create and supply telemetry equipment. Our goal was
   to broadly describe the current technological landscape, compare it to
   what we envision for the future, and make suggestions for how to reach
   that future.},

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1797-1803},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Human settlements, including cities, may provide wildlife with new
   ecological niches, in terms of habitat types and food availability, thus
   requiring plasticity for adaptation. The crested porcupine Hystrix
   cristata is a habitat-generalist, large-sized rodent, also recorded in
   some suburban areas, but no information is available on its habitat use
   in metropolitan landscapes. Here, we assessed the land-use factors
   influencing the presence of crested porcupines in a metropolitan area of
   Central Italy. We collected data on the occurrence of crested porcupines
   from the metropolitan area of Rome, following an observer-oriented
   approach to record occurrences and retreive pseudo-absences. We then
   related the presence/absence of H. cristata to landscape composition.
   Occupancy models showed that cultivations and scrubland were positively
   related to porcupine presence, most likely as they provide food
   resources and shelter sites, respectively. Although the crested
   porcupine has been confirmed as a ``generalist{''} species in terms of
   habitat selection, a strong preference for areas limiting the risk of
   being killed and providing enough food and shelter was observed. We
   therefore suggest that the crested porcupine may adapt to deeply
   modified landscapes such as large cities by selecting specific
   favourable land-use types.},

Title = {Identifying key habitats to conserve the threatened brown bear in the
   Himalaya},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {170},
Pages = {198-206},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The threatened Himalayan brown bear has a fragmented range in the
   Himalayas. However, its habitat has never been documented, which hinders
   conservation efforts. The Deosai Plateau in northern Pakistan has long
   been recognized as the core area for this subspecies in the country. To
   provide knowledge to help conserve the remnant populations in the
   Himalayan region, and especially in protected areas, we investigated
   habitat selection of brown bears and the influence of human presence on
   brown bear distribution in Deosai National Park, Pakistan.
   We used an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis to assess brown bear habitat
   selection, using scats sampled along transect routes throughout the park
   as location data. Habitat use based on 137 observations of brown bears
   during monitoring confirmed that differential scat detectability did not
   bias our results. Only 65\% of the park area had productive vegetation.
   Our analyses indicated that brown bears avoided higher elevations and
   steeper slopes and selected more productive parts of the park (marshy,
   grassy, and stony vegetation types). The marshy vegetation was the most
   preferred habitat, probably because it had the highest forage production
   and density of golden marmots. Brown bears tolerated human
   infrastructures, like roads and camps, but strongly avoided grazing
   areas with high livestock density. The habitat suitability map generally
   followed the biomass productivity patterns of the park. It indicated the
   central part as suitable, and classified half of the park, mainly
   peripheral areas, as unsuitable for brown bears.
   The vegetation and habitat suitability maps also provide an objective
   criterion for evaluating present and future developments in the park.
   Until recently, communities seem to have used the park's resources
   without significantly affecting the brown bear population. However, in
   recent years a large influx of nomadic communities with their livestock
   has become a challenge, which needs urgent attention to continue the
   present brown bear population recovery and to secure its habitat. We
   recommend monitoring the livestock and conducting a detailed inventory
   of the rangeland to understand grazing dynamics in the park and to
   maintain sustainable stocking rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Endemism in Wyoming plant and insect herbivore communities during the
   early Eocene hothouse},
Journal = {PALEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {421-439},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The warm, equable, and ice-free early Eocene Epoch permits investigation
   of ecosystem function and macro-ecological patterns during a very
   different climate regime than exists today. It also provides insight
   into what the future may entail, as anthropogenic CO2 release drives
   Earth toward a comparable hothouse condition. Studying plant-insect
   herbivore food webs during hothouse intervals is warranted, because
   these account for the majority of nonmicrobial terrestrial biodiversity.
   Here, we report new plant and insect herbivore damage census data from
   two floodplain sites in the Wind River Basin of central Wyoming, one in
   the Aycross Formation (50-48.25 Ma) at the basin edge (WRE) and the
   second in the Wind River Formation in the interior of the basin (WRI).
   The WRI site is in stratigraphic proximity to a volcanic ash that is
   newly dated to 52.416 +/- 0.016/0.028/0.063 (2 sigma). We compare the
   Wind River Basin assemblages to published data from a 52.65 Ma
   floodplain flora in the neighboring Bighorn (BH) Basin and find that
   only 5.6\% of plant taxa occur at all three sites and approximately 10\%
   occur in both basins. The dissimilar floras support distinct suites of
   insect herbivores, as recorded by leaf damage. The relatively
   low-diversity BH flora has the highest diversity of insect damage,
   contrary to hypotheses that insect herbivore diversity tracks floral
   diversity. The distinctiveness of the WRE flora is likely due to its
   younger age and cooler reconstructed paleotemperature, but these factors
   are nearly identical for the WRI and BH floras. Site-specific
   microenvironmental factors that cannot be measured easily in deep time
   may account for these differences. Alternatively, the Owl Creek
   Mountains between the two basins may have provided a formidable barrier
   to the thermophilic organisms that inhabited the basin interiors,
   supporting Janzen's hypothesis that mountain passes appear higher in
   tropical environments.},

Abstract = {There is a need to study the effects of urbanization on wildlife in
   order to understand the ecological implications of increasing
   urbanization and find out how to reduce its threats to biodiversity. The
   blue tit evolved as a forest species and prefers deciduous and mixed
   forests, whereas its nesting in urban habitats is a more recent
   phenomenon. Our long-term study of blue tit populations has been
   conducted in two habitats: an urban parkland (frequently visited by
   people) and a deciduous forest outside of the city. Using linear mixed
   modeling, we revealed that a relationship of blue tit breeding success
   (and the number of fledglings) with thermal conditions in May differed
   between the urban parkland and the forest. While the relationship was
   positive in the forest, it was negative in the parkland. In addition,
   breeding success in the parkland increased with increasing number of
   rainy days in May. We argue that the main possible reason for such
   patterns is human activity in the parkland, which interferes with tit
   parental care, especially the regular feeding of nestlings, whereas it
   is evidently associated with weather conditions. Human disturbance in
   the forest is likely to be negligible.},

Abstract = {US Corn Belt landscapes are heavily anthropogenic, consisting of a vast
   agricultural matrix with embedded urban areas. Little non-agricultural
   vegetated land remains in this region. Vegetation and vegetated areas in
   urban settings may thus be key to supporting this region's wildlife. We
   sought to assess relationships between mesopredator (mid-sized mammalian
   omnivores and carnivores) distributions and landscape structure and
   composition in a Corn Belt city, Iowa City, Iowa, USA. Using data from a
   network of motion-triggered cameras, we constructed multi-season
   occupancy models for five mesopredator species to identify occupancy
   patterns and their relationship to vegetated and built land cover and
   landscape structure within species-specific home range buffers. Species
   with larger home ranges, red fox and coyote, were more likely to
   colonize sites with greater amounts of forested land cover, more
   streams, and more cohesive patches of non-agricultural vegetation, and
   less likely to colonize sites with more impervious surfaces. Once
   established at sites, opossum and coyote were unlikely to disappear from
   sites regardless of landscape composition and structure. However, red
   fox was less likely to go extinct from sites with more impervious land
   cover while domestic cats were more likely to go extinct from sites with
   greater extents of and more cohesive natural land covers. These
   findings, by highlighting key landscape aspects driving occupancy
   dynamics for these species, could support mesopredator conservation in
   cities in agricultural landscapes.},

Title = {Beehive fences as a multidimensional conflict-mitigation tool for

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Increasing habitat fragmentation and human population growth in Africa
   has resulted in an escalation in human-elephant conflict between
   small-scale farmers and free-ranging African elephants (Lox-odonta
   Africana). In 2012 Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) implemented the national
   10-year Conservation and Management Strategy for the Elephant in Kenya,
   which includes an action aimed at testing whether beehive fences can be
   used to mitigate human-elephant conflict. From 2012 to 2015, we
   field-tested the efficacy of beehive fences to protect 10 0.4-ha farms
   next to Tsavo East National Park from elephants. We hung a series of
   beehives every 10 m around the boundary of each farm plot. The hives
   were linked with strong wire. After an initial pilot test with 2 farms,
   the remaining 8 of 10 beehive fences also contained 2-dimensional dummy
   hives between real beehives to help reduce the cost of the fence. Each
   trial plot had a neighboring control plot of the same size within the
   same farm. Of the 131 beehives deployed 88\% were occupied at least once
   during the 3.5-year trial. Two hundred and fifty-three elephants,
   predominantly 20-45 years old entered the community farming area,
   typically during the crop-ripening season. Eighty percent of the
   elephants that approached the trial farms were kept out of the areas
   protected by the beehive fences, and elephants that broke a fence were
   in smaller than average groups. Beehive fences not only kept large
   groups of elephants from invading the farmland plots but the farmers
   also benefited socially and financially from the sale of 228 kg of
   elephant-friendly honey. As news of the success of the trial spread, a
   further 12 farmers requested to join the project, bringing the number of
   beehive fence protected farms to 22 and beehives to 297. This
   demonstrates positive adoption of beehive fences as a community
   mitigation tool. Understanding the response of elephants to the beehive
   fences, the seasonality of crop raiding and fence breaking, and the
   willingness of the community to engage with the mitigation method will
   help contribute to future management strategies for this high
   human-elephant conflict hotspot and other similar areas in Kenya.},

Title = {Size matters: Scale mismatch between space use patterns of tigers and
   protected area size in a Tropical Dry Forest},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {197},
Pages = {146-153},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {India harbours the largest wild tiger population in the world and
   Tropical Dry Forest areas constitute the largest habitat for them.
   Recent extinctions, however, from two high profile tiger reserves,
   highlight the vulnerability of tiger in this habitat Our examination of
   historic range areas for tigers shows that populations are disappearing
   at a faster rate in Tropical Dry Forest (64\% sites suffering local
   extinction in 100 years) than in any other suitable habitat in India.
   Focusing on data from the Tropical Dry Forest of Panna Tiger Reserve in
   central India, we examine the spatial ecology of the tiger population
   prior to its local extinction. We analyse home range sizes, overlaps and
   shifts, as well as the range expansion and contraction of radio-collared
   tigers between 1996 and 2005. In this reserve, the average annual home
   range sizes for both males (n = 2) and females (n = 4) were three to
   four times larger than those reported so far from other tropical
   habitats in India male: mean 179.3 +/- 11.8 km(2) (95\% Fixed kernel; n
   = 7); female: mean 46.6 +/- 3.7 km(2); (95\% Fixed kernel; n = 16).
   Adult female home ranges were exclusive and overlapped little with
   neighbouring female ranges (3 +/- 1.46\%, n = 6). Male home ranges were
   not exclusive: resident floater males shared space with territorial
   males and mated with resident females. Home ranges of all breeding
   radio-collared tigers extended beyond the protected area boundary and
   were exposed to edge effects that exist at the periphery and outside.
   With such spatial use patterns, security and management measures
   provided within the boundary are unlikely to be very successful in
   protecting the population. Protected Areas in Tropical Dry Forest across
   India are relatively small (366.92 +/- 422.12 km(2) SD) and historical
   trends point towards a scale-mismatch that exists between the size of
   Protected Areas and the space use requirements of tigers. This scale
   mismatch adds to the vulnerability of existing small populations and
   perhaps explains why tiger populations in Tropical Dry Forest have
   disappeared at a faster rate than in any other tiger habitat of the
   sub-continent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Urethral catheterization as an alternative method for collecting sperm
   in the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes)},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {The endangered black-footed ferret (BFF; Mustela nigripes) is an
   important example of the benefits of assisted reproduction in species
   conservation with both semen evaluation and artificial insemination
   using fresh and frozen sperm being successfully incorporated into the
   breeding program. Currently, electroejaculation (EE) is routinely
   utilized for semen collection in BFFs, a technique that requires custom
   equipment and experienced operators, and does not consistently yield
   viable samples in this species. In this case study, we evaluated the
   feasibility of urethral catheterization (UC) for semen collection, a
   method predominately tested in domestic and non-domestic felids, on four
   occasions (three BFF males). After general anesthesia with a combination
   of ketamine, midazolam and alpha 2-agonist dexmedetomidine (thought to
   promote semen release into the urethra), a lightly lubricated, flexible
   feeding tube was passed into the urethral opening and advanced similar
   to 7-8 cm into the urethra. A syringe attached to the feeding tube was
   used to apply mild negative pressure to collect sperm. Semen samples

Title = {Coming in like a wrecking-ball: are native Eurasian red squirrels
   displacing invasive Siberian chipmunks? A study from an urban park},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},

Abstract = {Alien squirrels may seriously threaten native species by means of
   interspecific competition. In our work, we analysed whether the
   distribution of alien Siberian chipmunks within the Sigurta Garden urban
   park (north-eastern Italy) changed after the natural spread of native
   Eurasian red squirrels in a 20-year period. Distribution of both
   squirrels was estimated through a citizen-science approach, in the first
   10-year after red squirrel arrival 1 (i.e. Decade 1: 1997-2006) and in
   the second 10-year interval (i.e. Decade 2: 2007-2017). We compared
   habitat use of both species and we assessed whether a vertical
   segregation occurred through a dissimilarity index. Woodlands were
   selected by both species in both decades. Red squirrels also selected
   tree lines in Decade 1. A vertical segregation was apparent in Decade 1,
   whereas in Decade 2 both squirrel species were observed on the lowest
   branches or on the ground, where they are fed by humans. This was also
   confirmed by the habitat niche-overlap index, which increased in Decade
   2. The extent of occurrence of Sciurus vulgaris increased throughout the
   park, whereas those of Eutamias sibiricus decreased. Differently from
   what is usually observed with alien squirrels, the spread of the native
   species appears to be halting and reversing the expansion of the
   non-native one.},

Title = {Physiological effects of tourism and associated food provisioning in an
   endangered iguana},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Deliberately feeding wildlife is an increasingly popular tourism-related
   activity despite a limited understanding of long-term impacts on the
   species being fed. As a result, tourist behaviours that may have adverse
   impacts on imperiled species have often been encouraged without the
   necessary evaluation or oversight. Here, we report the responses of
   Northern Bahamian Rock Iguanas (Cyclura cychlura) to human-visitation
   pressure and associated food provisioning. We compared a variety of
   blood chemistry parameters of iguanas subjected to supplemental feeding
   at popular tourist destinations with iguanas occurring on islands where
   supplemental feeding does not take place. We demonstrate that male and
   female iguanas inhabiting tourist-visited islands where supplemental
   feeding occurs do not differ in body condition or baseline stress and
   stress response (determined by corticosterone levels) compared with
   iguanas from non-visited islands. Both males and females from
   tourist-visited sites experienced a greater incidence of endoparasitic
   infection and atypical loose faeces. Indicators of dietary nutrition,
   including glucose, potassium, and uric acid values, also differed for
   both sexes from tourist-visited and unvisited islands. Male iguanas from
   visited islands differed significantly from those on non-visited islands
   in calcium, cholesterol, cobalt, copper, magnesium, packed cell volume,
   selenium, and triglyceride concentrations, whereas female iguanas from
   visited islands differed significantly in ionized calcium. Although the
   interpretation of these differences is challenging, chronic biochemical
   stressors could compromise individual health over time or decrease
   survivorship during periods of environmental stress. We suggest
   protocols that can be adopted throughout the region to ensure that
   supplemental feeding has fewer impacts on these long-lived iguanas.},

Title = {Fecal stress, nutrition and reproductive hormones for monitoring
   environmental impacts on tigers (Panthera tigris)},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {Non-invasive stress and nutritional hormone analysis in relation to
   ecological and other biological indices have tremendous potential to
   address environmental disturbance impacts on wildlife health. To this
   end, we examined the relation between glucocorticoid (GC) and thyroid
   (T3) hormone indices of disturbance and nutritional stress in response
   to ACTH and TSH challenges in captive tigers, as well as how
   reproductive hormones vary by sex and reproductive condition.
   Glucocorticoid, thyroid, progesterone and androgen assays conducted on
   high-performance liquid chromatography separated fractions of
   biologically relevant fecal extracts revealed high cross-reactivity of
   these assays for their respective biologically relevant fecal hormone
   metabolites. Both adrenal and thyroid hormone metabolites were elevated
   in response to ACTH and TSH challenges. However, the adrenal and thyroid
   hormone responses to ACTH challenge were concurrent, whereas the adrenal
   response to TSH challenge was delayed relative to thyroid hormone
   elevation in both males and females. The concurrently elevated T3 in
   response to ACTH may serve to raise metabolic rate to maximize use of
   GC-mobilized glucose, whereas the relatively delayed GC rise following
   TSH challenge may be a response to glucose depletion due to increased
   metabolic rate associated with elevated T3. Progesterone, testosterone
   and androstenedione hormone metabolites were significantly elevated
   during gestation compared to lactation in a female monitored from
   conception through early lactation. Results suggest that the
   glucocorticoid, thyroid and reproductive hormone assays we tested can
   accurately measure the stress, nutrition and reproductive response from
   tiger feces, providing useful non-invasive tools to assess physiological
   responses to environmental stressors and their reproductive consequences
   in the wild.},

Title = {Point-of-care testing for measuring haemolymph glucose in invertebrates
   is not a valid method},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {Blood glucose is widely used as a physiological parameter for
   vertebrates and invertebrates. However, its measurement in the field is
   often difficult due to the need for expensive and non-portable
   equipment. Point-of-care (POC) devices, originally intended for human
   use, are increasingly being used for measuring blood parameters of
   animals in the field. In this regard, POC glucose meters are becoming
   valuable tools for conservation physiologists, as glucose can be a
   useful indicator of stress response. In invertebrates, the use of POC
   glucose meters is still scarce, and no study yet has evaluated their
   usability in crustaceans and molluscs. We tested if a POC device can be
   used to measure haemolymph glucose in two widely used models, Leptuca
   thayeri and Perna perna, compared with a standard laboratory method. The
   device was unable to measure glucose in P. perna haemolymph due to
   equipment inaccuracy and low glucose concentration in this species
   (10.13 +/- 6.25 mg/dL). Additionally, despite the device being capable
   of measuring glucose in L. thayeri haemolymph, Bland-Altman plots showed
   a strong bias and wide limits of agreement, and Lin's concordance
   correlation coefficient showed a weak concordance between methods. When
   simulating experimental conditions, POC results differed from those
   found using the standard method. We conclude that POC glucose meters are
   unsuitable for assessing glucose in mussels and should not be used in
   crabs as results are inaccurate.},

Title = {Zinc concentrations in teeth of female walruses reflect the onset of
   reproductive maturity},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 13},
Abstract = {Age at maturity is an important parameter in many demographic models
   and, for some species, can be difficult to obtain using traditional
   methods. Incremental growth structures act as biological archives,
   recording information throughout an organism's life and possibly
   allowing for the reconstruction of life history events. Concentrations
   of zinc (Zn) in animal tissues are known to be linked to life history,
   physiology and reproduction and may be retained in incremental growth
   structures. This study reconstructed lifetime Zn concentrations in teeth
   (n= 93) of female Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens)
   collected from1932-2016. Zn displayed a characteristic pattern of
   accumulation, with a change point marking the beginning of a lifelong,
   linear increase in Zn concentrations. We hypothesized that this change
   point marks the onset of reproductive maturity. The age at which the
   change point occurred (age(cp)) was estimated by counting tooth cementum
   growth layers. These estimates closely matched literature values of
   timing of first ovulation in female walruses. Total number of ovulations
   (estimated from ovary corpora counts from paired tooth/ovary specimens)
   was closely related to reproductive lifespan (total lifespan - age(cp);
   R-2 = 0.70). Further, age(cp) tracked changes in Pacific walrus
   population size as a proportion of carrying capacity, decreasing when
   the population was depleted by commercial hunting and peaking when
   carrying capacity was exceeded. This novel approach will aid walrus
   management, and is likely applicable to other species, offering a
   potentially powerful tool for research, management and conservation of
   wildlife populations.},

Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {199-213},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Urban residents and nature have often beneficial interactions, but there
   can also be conflict. We investigated the relationship between human
   wellbeing and nature in the two most-populous cities of both Australia
   and New Zealand. An online survey measured nature value orientations,
   and a selection of respondents who agreed to be contacted again were
   chosen based on their nature value orientation to invite to a focus
   group. This ensured that focus group participants represented a
   continuum of value orientations. Regardless of their nature value
   orientation, focus group participants were clear about needing nature in
   their city. They expressed strong opinions about how nature should be
   incorporated into the urban matrix to improve their lives. All focus
   groups described the integrated design of urban and natural elements
   when discussing positive experiences of nature in cities and had
   persistent concerns about how natural spaces are managed. While
   participants in different cities did discuss different landscape
   attributes and nature-related challenges, such as flooding, these
   differences did not affect the overall desire for nature in cities. We
   argue that urban design has the potential to ensure that residents
   engage with and experience nature in cities, and that design practices
   and policies could support the successful human-nature integration.
   Further research in other locations would determine how this work scales
   to either smaller towns and developed areas with smaller populations, or
   to mega-cities and other countries around the world.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in three districts of the southern lowveld of
   Zimbabwe to assess the economic impact of CAMPFIRE among rural
   households in the area. Data were collected through surveys from
   households (n = 569) and key informant interviews from ward councillors
   from 10 communities, and historical data from the district offices
   between September and November 2014. Results showed that households were
   incentivised through direct and indirect economic benefits. The direct
   economic benefits were small but the households appreciated the
   infrastructural facilities from CAMPFIRE. About 3\% of surveyed
   households felt that CAMPFIRE contributed to a reduction in
   human-wildlife conflicts. Both direct and indirect benefits deteriorated
   after donor withdrawal beginning 2003, as evidenced by a sharp decline
   in household dividends, and an increase in human-wildlife conflicts and
   incidences of illegal hunting. However, given that households still
   benefit from CAMPFIRE, more than a decade after donor withdrawal is an
   indication of its resilience. Revitalising the CAMPFIRE model is crucial
   given its benefits for households at the grassroots and its contribution
   to conservation. Improving transparency and providing tenure security
   for the hunting area in CAMPFIRE would increase effective ownership of
   the programme at the household level and promote its sustainability.},

Abstract = {Protected areas are the core of efforts to conserve biological diversity
   and zoning uses, and they are used as a tool for their management.
   Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS)
   have been used to evaluate conflicts between approved uses and actual
   uses in La Restinga Lagoon National Park in Venezuela (LRLNP). The park
   (188.6 km(2)), covers various ecosystems such as coastal lagoons, marine
   waters and xerophytic vegetation, it is visited by up to 260,000 people
   visit per year. A GIS, using a base map compiled from 1:25,000 maps was
   developed. Natural cover was mapped from LANDSAT VII TM images,
   orthophotomaps and aerial photographs. Spatial use data was collected by
   field GPS location of any use inside the park during 2 years. Thematic
   vector maps for each land cover, zoning area, and observed use were
   created. Maps of zoning and uses were overlapped and new maps for each
   use-zoning crossing were created. The park contain nine different zoning
   areas wherein 28 different uses were identified, 18 of them were direct
   consumptive and non-consumptive uses, occurring on 54\% of the park.
   Tourism transit areas were the most used zones. More than 5,000 people
   use the park during a high season day. Superimposition of zoning maps
   with actual use data produced 13 uses taking place in not allowed areas
   (46\% of park area). Most common prohibited use was commercial net
   fishing, occurring in nearly 40\% of the park area. Therefore,
   identifying human use conflicts and its geographical distribution is a
   key issue to improve Management Plans as well as identifying hot sites.
   The GPS-GIS methodology presented here allows Park Rangers to select
   those areas which could benefit from enhanced supervision with the
   limited budget available.},

Title = {What's in a yardscape? A case study of emergent ecosystem services and

Abstract = {Residential yardscapes are at the forefront of human interaction with
   nature for those living in urban areas across Europe and North America.
   In recent years a significant amount of research has investigated urban
   green spaces using the ecosystem services framework (ES) along with
   ecosystem disservices (ED) and how such spaces deliver urban ecosystem
   services (UES). However, a gap exists in understanding how ES and ED
   manifest themselves in the more specific context of residential
   yardscapes. Specifically, do homeowners conceptualize ES and ED when
   talking about their yards without specific prompts to reflect services
   and disservices? The current work presents a case study of homeowners in
   the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota, United States.
   We used two associated surveys to elicit responses related to
   homeowners' yards. Without prompting, homeowner conceptualizations of
   their yardscapes reflected all ES categories with cultural (CES) (e.g.,
   family recreation) and provisioning (PES) (e.g., vegetable cultivation)
   services cited most often. Homeowners also mentioned ED associated with
   their own or a neighbor's yard (e.g., attraction of nuisance wildlife).
   Their plans for yardscapes indicated largely incremental changes (e.g.,
   putting in a new planting bed) vs. drastic shifts (e.g., complete
   replacement of turfgrass with alternative vegetation). This case study
   illustrates that the homeowners' conceptualizations of their yards do
   indeed reflect current ES \& ED frameworks without specific prompting.
   The ES framework, combined with the identified leverage points, can be a
   fruitful approach for enhancing UES and minimizing ED within residential
   yardscapes.},

Title = {The effects of urbanization on carnivores in the New York metropolitan
   area},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},

Volume = {23},

Pages = {215-225},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The presence of human activity and development affects the distribution
   and behavior of carnivore species in various ways. It is necessary to
   examine the effects of urbanization and associated habitat fragmentation
   on the spatial ecology of predators, in order to develop a comprehensive
   understanding and formulate a proactive approach towards biodiversity
   protection in such areas. In this study, we observed patterns of
   occurrence and activity of carnivores in four preserves in metropolitan
   the New York and New Jersey region. Over the course of a ten-month trail
   camera study, 104 randomly positioned camera stations (5642 trap nights)
   yielded 793 total captures of 7 species: black bear (Ursus americanus),
   bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), opossum (Didelphis
   virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and
   striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). We found correlations between
   captures and level of human development, preserve size, and time of day
   of capture. Further, we found that the relative abundance of carnivores
   was higher in preserves with a higher level of surrounding development,
   suggesting the use of these habitat fragments as refuges. Coyotes and
   raccoons were more likely to be observed in areas with higher
   development. All carnivores combined were more likely to be observed at
   night in areas wither higher development, indicating a temporal response
   of carnivores to human activity. Our results emphasize the value of
   preserving intact habitat fragments in urban and suburban areas, and
   strongly suggest that carnivore use of parkland and greenspace should be
   monitored continuously to measure impacts on these species as conversion
   of surrounding land persists.},

Title = {BIOTAS: BIOTelemetry Analysis Software, for the semi-automated removal
   of false positives from radio telemetry data},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Introduction: Radio telemetry, one of the most widely used techniques
   for tracking wildlife and fisheries populations, has a false-positive
   problem. Bias from false-positive detections can affect many important
   derived metrics, such as home range estimation, site occupation,
   survival, and migration timing. False-positive removal processes have
   relied upon simple filters and personal opinion. To overcome these
   shortcomings, we have developed BIOTAS (BIOTelemetry Analysis Software)
   to assist with false-positive identification, removal, and data
   management for large-scale radio telemetry projects.
   Methods: BIOTAS uses a naive Bayes classifier to identify and remove
   false-positive detections from radio telemetry data. The semi-supervised
   classifier uses spurious detections from unknown tags and study tags as
   training data. We tested BIOTAS on four scenarios: wide-band receiver
   with a single Yagi antenna, wide-band receiver that switched between two
   Yagi antennas, wide-band receiver with a single dipole antenna, and
   single-band receiver that switched between five frequencies. BIOTAS has
   a built in a k-fold cross-validation and assesses model quality with
   sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value,
   false-positive rate, and precision-recall area under the curve. BIOTAS
   also assesses concordance with a traditional consecutive detection
   filter using Cohen's kappa.
   Results: Overall BIOTAS performed equally well in all scenarios and was
   able to discriminate between known false-positive detections and valid
   study tag detections with low false-positive rates (< 0.001) as
   determined through crossvalidation, even as receivers switched between
   antennas and frequencies. BIOTAS classified between 94 and 99\% of study
   tag detections as valid.
   Conclusion: As part of a robust data management plan, BIOTAS is able to
   discriminate between detections from study tags and known false
   positives. BIOTAS works with multiple manufacturers and accounts for
   receivers that switch between antennas and frequencies. BIOTAS provides
   the framework for transparent, objective, and repeatable telemetry
   projects for wildlife conservation surveys, and increases the efficiency
   of data processing.},

Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {459-466},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Invasive species have been causing important and irreversible impacts to
   native species and communities of ecosystems. They distort ecosystem
   functions by degrading forest lands, wetlands, and agricultural habitats
   and replace the native vegetation and reduce biodiversity, forest
   productivity, and suitable wildlife habitat. To address disturbances
   caused by invasive species occurrence, further information is needed
   regarding the occurrence, extent, and dispersal of invasive species and
   how land use may increase the spread of these species. The objective of
   this study was to find the frequency and dominance of three invasive
   species common to riparian areas of east Alabama: Ligustrum sinense
   (Chinese privet), Elaeagnus pungens (silverthorn), and Triadica sebifera
   (Chinese tallow tree). Surveys of these species in riparian forests in
   and around Auburn, Alabama were conducted to show the relative extent of
   these shrubs and their relation to urban land use. It was expected to
   see the highest levels of invasive species in the city center with
   decreasing levels radiating outward into rural areas. Another objective
   was how urban land use may affect the presence-absence and prevalence of
   these non-native plant species within study sites. The results showed
   that around the city center and suburban lands, cover of both Chinese
   privet and silverthorn tended to increase. In contrast, Chinese tallow
   tree density percent cover showed an opposite trend with landscapes
   close to city center often having slightly less cover. This study shows
   that urban land use may be an important association with distribution of
   invasive plant species.},

Abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation have been leading jaguars to constant
   conflicts with humans, and as a result, jaguar populations have been
   declining over the last decades. Captive breeding is often a tool for
   species conservation, and it is not different for jaguars. However,
   success is far from optimal due to the lack of basic knowledge about
   species' reproductive biology. In the present study, we assessed gonadal
   hormonal profiles of natural oestral cycles and puberty and compared our
   data to those of other wild felids. We collected faecal samples from two
   to seven times per week for 18 months from two adults and three
   pre-pubertal females. We defined baseline levels for progestins and
   oestrogens in order to estimate oestrous cycle length and age at
   puberty. We compared our data with 16 other species through generalized
   linear model, using weight and genus as two explanatory variables. Cycle
   length was 38.28 +/- 2.52 days, ranging from 25 to 44 days, while sexual
   maturity was attained within 22 months. Due to our analysis of both
   hormonal and behavioural data, there is a variation between this
   research from other studies that employed only behavioural observations.
   Such difference may be caused by the absence of behavioural oestrous at
   the peri-pubertal period. When compared to wild felids of similar size,
   puberty and oestral cycle durations of the jaguar females fell within
   the same range. Our modelling showed that age at maturity was influenced
   mostly by size and only Leopardus partially explained the observed
   variation. Conversely, oestral cycle length did not differ among genera
   or size categories. Our study adds to the body literature in the
   reproductive endocrinology of wild felids, and because female gametes
   are more challenging to collect and preserve, a strong understanding on
   the female reproductive physiology is essential to assisted reproduction
   and wild population viability assessment.},

Abstract = {Many recent studies have suggested that cities are spatially
   heterogeneous. Only limited research has investigated whether urban
   heterogeneity influences the distribution of bats in a city. Between
   2010 and 2012, we acoustically surveyed bats in Waco, Texas, a
   medium-sized city in the United States. Seven species were detected,
   five in adequate quantity for analyses. Three distinct distribution
   patterns were evident (Mexican free-tailed bats; red bats and evening
   bats; big brown bats and cave myotis), reflecting the distinct
   functional guilds of these species. Bayesian conditional autoregressive
   models indicated that tree-dwelling red bats and evening bats were
   influenced by variables describing heterogeneity of urban vegetation.
   Big brown bats and cave myotis were associated with variables related to
   water sources. Mexican free-tailed bat distribution could be explained
   well by variables related to urban buildings and other constructions.
   Our modeling also suggested that urban socioeconomic heterogeneity
   influenced bat distributions. Distributions of tree-dwelling bats
   corresponded to income level. Distributions of Mexican free-tailed bats,
   big brown bats, and cave myotis related to human density. These results
   support the idea that a city comprises a mosaic of habitats as perceived
   by various species of bats and likely by other species of wildlife in
   urban settings.},

Title = {Energetic benefits of enhanced summer roosting habitat for little brown
   bats (Myotis lucifugus) recovering from white-nose syndrome},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Habitat modification can improve outcomes for imperilled wildlife.
   Insectivorous bats in North America face a range of conservation
   threats, including habitat loss and white-nose syndrome (WNS). Even
   healthy bats face energetic constraints during spring, but enhancement
   of roosting habitat could reduce energetic costs, increase survival and
   enhance recovery from WNS. We tested the potential of artificial heating
   of bat roosts as a management tool for threatened bat populations. We
   predicted that: (i) after hibernation, captive bats would be more likely
   to select a roost maintained at a temperature near their thermoneutral
   zone; (ii) bats recovering from WNS at the end of hibernation would show
   a stronger preference for heated roosts compared with healthy bats; and
   (iii) heated roosts would result in biologically significant energy
   savings. We housed two groups of bats (WNS-positive and control) in
   separate flight cages following hibernation. Over 7.5 weeks, we
   quantified the presence of individuals in heated vs. unheated bat houses
   within each cage. We then used a series of bioenergetic models to
   quantify thermoregulatory costs in each type of roost under a number of
   scenarios. Bats preferentially selected heated bat houses, but
   WNS-affected bats were much more likely to use the heated bat house
   compared with control animals. Our model predicted energy savings of up
   to 81.2\% for bats in artificially heated roosts if roost temperature
   was allowed to cool at night to facilitate short bouts of torpor. Our
   results are consistent with research highlighting the importance of
   roost microclimate and suggest that protection and enhancement of
   high-quality, natural roosting environments should be a priority
   response to a range of threats, including WNS. Our findings also suggest
   the potential of artificially heated bat houses to help populations
   recover from WNS, but more work is needed before these might be
   implemented on a large scale.},

Title = {The apparency hypothesis applied to a local pharmacopoeia in the
   Brazilian northeast},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Background: Data from an ethnobotanical study were analyzed to see if
   they were in agreement with the biochemical basis of the apparency
   hypothesis based on an analysis of a pharmacopeia in a rural community
   adjacent to the Araripe National Forest (Floresta Nacional do Araripe -
   FLONA) in northeastern Brazil. The apparency hypothesis considers two
   groups of plants, apparent and non-apparent, that are characterized by
   conspicuity for herbivores (humans) and their chemical defenses.
   Methods: This study involved 153 interviewees and used semi-structured
   interviews. The plants were grouped by habit and lignification to
   evaluate the behavior of these categories in terms of ethnospecies
   richness, use value and practical and commercial importance. Information
   about sites for collecting medicinal plants was also obtained. The
   salience of the ethnospecies was calculated. G-tests were used to test
   for differences in ethnospecies richness among collection sites and the
   Kruskal-Wallis test to identify differences in the use values of plants
   depending on habit and lignifications (e.g. plants were classes as woody
   or non-woody, the first group comprising trees, shrubs, and lignified
   climbers (vines) and the latter group comprising herbs and non-lignified
   climbers). Spearman's correlation test was performed to relate salience
   to use value and these two factors with the commercial value of the
   plants.
   Results: A total of 222 medicinal plants were cited. Herbaceous and
   woody plants exhibited the highest ethnospecies richness, the non-woody
   and herbaceous plants had the most practical value (current use), and
   anthropogenic areas were the main sources of woody and non-woody
   medicinal plants; herbs and trees were equally versatile in treating
   diseases and did not differ with regard to use value. Trees were
   highlighted as the most commercially important growth habit.
   Conclusions: From the perspective of its biochemical fundamentals, the
   apparency hypothesis does not have predictive potential to explain the
   use value and commercial value of medicinal plants. In other hand, the
   herbaceous habit showed the highest ethnospecies richness in the
   community pharmacopeia, which is an expected prediction, corroborating
   the apparency hypothesis.},

Title = {Qiviut cortisol is associated with metrics of health and other intrinsic

Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Glucocorticoid (GC) levels are increasingly and widely used as
   biomarkers of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity to
   study the effects of environmental changes and other perturbations on
   wildlife individuals and populations. However, identifying the intrinsic
   and extrinsic factors that influence GC levels is a key step in
   endocrinology studies to ensure accurate interpretation of GC responses.
   In muskoxen, qiviut (fine woolly undercoat hair) cortisol concentration
   is an integrative biomarker of HPA axis activity over the course of the
   hair's growth. We gathered data from 219 wild muskoxen harvested in the
   Canadian Arctic between October 2015 and May 2019. We examined the
   relationship between qiviut cortisol and various intrinsic (sex, age,
   body condition and incisor breakage) and extrinsic biotic factors
   (lungworm and gastrointestinal parasite infections and exposure to
   bacteria), as well as broader non-specific landscape and temporal
   features (geographical location, season and year). A Bayesian approach,
   which allows for the joint estimation of missing values in the data and
   model parameters estimates, was applied for the statistical analyses.
   The main findings include the following: (i) higher qiviut cortisol
   levels in males than in females; (ii) inter-annual variations; (iii)
   higher qiviut cortisol levels in a declining population compared to a
   stable population; (iv) a negative association between qiviut cortisol
   and marrow fat percentage; (v) a relationship between qiviut cortisol
   and the infection intensity of the lungworm Umingmakstrongylus
   pallikuukensis, which varied depending on the geographical location; and
   (vi) no association between qiviut cortisol and other pathogen
   exposure/infection intensity metrics. This study confirmed and further
   identified important sources of variability in qiviut cortisol levels,
   while providing important insights on the relationship between GC levels
   and pathogen exposure/infection intensity. Results support the use of
   qiviut cortisol as a tool to monitor temporal changes in HPA axis
   activity at a population level and to inform management and conservation
   actions.},

Abstract = {Despite the accelerating global urbanization and its associated
   implications for wildlife and humans, we know little about the biology
   of urban ecosystems. Here, we investigated colonization and habitat
   selection of the European hare (Lepus europaeus), a declining farmland
   species, in urban areas in Denmark, using a combination of citizen
   science data and transect counts. Further, we estimated the population
   density of urban hares in Aarhus, Denmark's second largest city. Our
   results provide the first evidence that hares have established
   populations in urban areas, potentially in response to decreasing
   habitat quality in rural areas due to agricultural intensification. The
   hare density in Aarhus was ca. 8 hares per km(2), which is comparable to
   or slightly higher than hare abundance estimates from various pastural
   areas in Europe, suggesting that urban areas provide suitable habitat
   for hares. Hare habitat selection was generally associated with areas
   consisting of large lawns, such as high buildings and parks, which
   potentially provide high-quality forage throughout the year. Considering

Title = {Factors affecting energy expenditure in a declining fur seal population},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 26},
Abstract = {Quantifying metabolic rates and the factors that influence them is key
   to wildlife conservation efforts because anthropogenic activities and
   habitat alteration can disrupt energy balance, which is critical for
   reproduction and survival. We investigated the effect of diving
   behaviour, diet and season on field metabolic rates (FMR) and foraging
   success of lactating northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) from the
   Pribil of Islands during a period of population decline. Variation in
   at-sea FMR was in part explained by season and trip duration, with
   values that ranged from 5.18 to 9.68 W kg(-1) (n = 48). Fur seals
   experienced a 7.2\% increase in at-sea FMR from summer to fall and a
   1.9\% decrease in at-sea FMR for each additional day spent at sea. There
   was no effect of foraging effort, dive depth or diet on at-sea FMR. Mass
   gains increased with trip duration and were greater in the fall compared
   with summer, but were unrelated to at-sea FMR, diving behaviour and
   diet. Seasonal increases in at-sea FMR may have been due to costs
   associated with the annual molt but did not appear to adversely impact
   the ability of females to gain mass on foraging trips. The overall high
   metabolic rates in conjunction with the lack of any diet-related effects
   on atsea FMR suggests that northern fur seals may have reached a
   metabolic ceiling early in the population decline. This provides
   indirect evidence that food limitation may be contributing to the low
   pup growth rates observed in the Pribilof Islands, as a high metabolic
   overhead likely results in less available energy for lactation. The
   limited ability of female fur seals to cope with changes in prey
   availability through physiological mechanisms is particularly concerning
   given the recent and unprecedented environmental changes in the Bering
   Sea that are predicted to have ecosystem-level impacts.},

Title = {Indigenous plant protection practices of Tripura, India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 13},
Abstract = {Background Traditional plant protection strategies have an integral part
   of food production system in North Eastern state Tripura, India, which
   has bestowed with rich heritage and biodiversity. However, there is no
   comprehensive report on the indigenous plant protection practices
   (IPPPs) specific to insect and vertebrate pest management, being
   followed by the inhabitants of the region for centuries. The present
   study was conducted to investigate, collect, and document the vulnerable
   IPPP practices followed by the native people from far flung locations of
   the Tripura. Methods The study aimed to document the IPPP following
   semi-structured questionnaires, participatory interaction, and direct
   observations with a total of 200 informants. We have calculated the
   relative frequencies of citation (RFC) for IPPP and estimated principal
   component analysis to link the status of IPPP with socio-demographic
   factors of the informants. The relationship between the field of IPPP
   used and different covariates (age, education, occupation, gender,
   location, and house type) was assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and
   Chi-square test. The relationship between adoption level and the
   respondents' characteristics was analyzed using count regression
   analysis. Results The study found that the status of the IPPP has
   increased for mitigating pest issues. A total of 39 indigenous practices
   were recorded specifically to pest management from the ethnic people of
   Tripura, India. People acquired pretty knowledge about IPPP, and these
   were inherited from ancestors. The respondents in the study developed
   notable innovations for the management of many pest issues using locally
   available resources that warrant cost-effective and eco-friendly. Seed
   drying before storage to protect grain commodities was the most cited
   IPPP with a frequency of citation 0.675. In the field of IPPP used, the
   people primarily practiced agriculture + horticulture + storage
   category. An important implication from the study is the identification
   of two IPPP strategies in this region for the first time. Furthermore,
   the recorded IPPP used field was significantly associated with age,
   education, occupation, gender, locality, and house type. Likewise, the
   respondents' socio-demographic variables were coupled considerably with
   the adoption of specific IPPP. Conclusion The reported IPPP for
   alleviating pest problems reflects the wisdom and generosity of the
   ethnic growers of Tripura, India. The study suggests the IPPP has strong
   potential in an integrated pest management approach passed down from
   generation to generation. The vulnerable practices largely remained
   unexplored due to inadequate scientific scrutiny and authenticity, yet
   in danger of being lost if not documented systematically. This study
   provides the first step toward accessing the valuable technology of
   untapped Tripura in IPPP and could be viable in paving action paradigm
   for their preservation, diffusion, and application with advanced pest
   management options.},

Abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict is increasing as urbanization expands and
   wildlife species adjust to living near people. Translocation is often
   used to manage human-wildlife conflict because it is considered to be
   humane, yet fates of translocated animals are largely unknown. As an
   urban adapter, woodchucks (Marmota monax) are a common source of
   human-wildlife conflict due to their burrowing, foraging, and
   scent-marking behavior. We examined survival and movements of 27
   nuisance woodchucks captured by a nuisance wildlife operator in the
   Chicago metropolitan area, radiomarked with internal transmitters, and
   translocated to exurban release sites mimicking typical practices. We
   also captured and radiomarked 16 resident woodchucks from the release
   landscape for comparison. Translocated woodchucks moved farther than
   residents immediately post release with no evidence of homing and most
   left the release site. Annual survival did not differ between
   translocated and resident woodchucks. However, survival was extremely
   low (0.18) compared to previous estimates for woodchucks, primarily due
   to high predation by coyotes (Canis latrans). Translocation should be
   used only when other nonlethal methods are ineffective (e.g., exclusion,
   removing food sources, selecting unpalatable plants for gardens). When
   necessary, the practice of translocation could be improved by reducing
   predation risk for translocated animals, either by selecting release
   sites with low predation risk, or by using soft-release methods, such as
   acclimation enclosures or artificial burrows.},

Volume = {21},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {European hamster (Cricetus cricetus) holds the status of a strictly
   protected species with the necessity to be active protected. The decline
   in its population and limitations in the native habitats in Europe is
   probably closely related to the loss of their habitats among others due
   to development of infrastructure and urbanization. On the other side
   urban areas can be an alternative habitat for hamsters. This study
   compared the functioning of local population of hamsters inhabiting two
   areas of high and low level and different kind of human activity. Few
   key aspects that determine the functioning of the population were
   considered: the dynamics of the number of burrows in a season of
   activity, threats resulting from different environmental conditions, and
   elements of hamsters' activities and behaviour which can tell us about
   the level of their adaptation to human presence. Hamsters inhabiting
   areas located in the periphery of city have been adapted to living near
   humans by adjustment of their activities to the rhythm of human activity
   and a slightly higher caution, shown in increased locomotor activity.
   Compared with rural locality, the locality with a higher level of human
   activity shows a lower species diversification, number and pressure of
   wild species of predators. In periurban areas the preying pressure of
   domesticated cats is greater, while in rural areas - by both feral
   unattended dogs.},

Title = {Legal ivory trade in a corrupt world and its impact on African elephant
   populations},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-60},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Illegal hunting of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) for ivory is
   causing rapid declines in their populations. Since 2007, illegal ivory
   trade has more than doubled. African elephants are facing the most
   serious conservation crisis since 1989, when international trade was
   banned. One solution proposed is establishment of a controlled legal
   trade in ivory. High prices for ivory mean that the incentives to obtain
   large quantities are high, but the quantity of tusks available for trade
   are biologically constrained. Within that context, effective management
   of a legal ivory trade would require robust systems to be in place to
   ensure that ivory from illegally killed elephants cannot be laundered
   into a legal market. At present, that is not feasible due to corruption
   among government officials charged with implementing wildlife-related
   legislation. With organized criminal enterprises involved along the
   whole commodity chain, corruption enables the laundering of illegal
   ivory into legal or potentially legal markets. Poachers and traffickers
   can rapidly pay their way out of trouble, so the financial incentives to
   break the law heavily outweigh those of abiding by it. Maintaining
   reliable permitting systems and leak-proof chains of custody in this
   context is challenging, and effective management breaks down. Once
   illegal ivory has entered the legal trade, it is difficult or impossible
   for enforcement officers to know what is legal and illegal. Addressing
   corruption throughout a trade network that permeates countries across
   the globe will take decades, if it can ever be achieved. That will be
   too late for wild African elephants at current rates of loss. If we are
   to conserve remaining wild populations, we must close all markets
   because, under current levels of corruption, they cannot be controlled
   in a way that does not provide opportunities for illegal ivory being
   laundered into legal markets. Comercio Legal de Marfil en un Mundo
   Corrupto y su Imapacto sobre Poblaciones de Elefantes
   Resumen La caceria ilegal de elefantes africanos (Loxodonta africana)
   por su marfil esta provocando declinaciones rapidas en sus poblaciones.
   Desde 2007, el comercio ilegal de marfil ha incrementado mas del doble.
   Los elefantes africanos estan enfrentando la crisis de conservacion mas
   seria desde 1989, cuando se prohibio el comercio internacional de
   marfil. Una solucion que se propone es el establecimiento de un comercio
   legal controlado de marfil. Los altos precios del marfil significan que
   los incentivos para obtener grandes cantidades son altos, pero la
   cantidad de colmillos disponibles para el comercio esta limitada
   biologicamente. En ese contexto, el manejo efectivo de un comercio legal
   de marfil requeriria del funcionamiento de sistemas robustos para
   asegurar que el marfil obtenido de elefantes cazados ilegalmente no sea
   lavado hacia el mercado legal. Actualmente, eso no es factible debido a
   la corrupcion de oficiales de gobierno encargados de implementar la
   legislacion relacionada con vida silvestre. Con la presencia de empresas
   del crimen organizado a lo largo de la cadena, la corrupcion permite el
   lavado de marfil ilegal hacia mercados legales o potencialmente legales.
   Los cazadores y traficantes ilegales pagan por evitar problemas, asi que
   los incentivos financieros para quebrantar la ley son mucho mas fuertes
   que los incentivos para cumplirla. En este contexto, el mantenimiento de
   sistemas confiables para emitir permisos y para cadenas de custodia
   hermeticas es un reto, y el manejo efectivo se descompone. Una vez que
   el marfil ilegal ha entrado al comercio legal, es dificil o imposible
   que los oficiales sepan que es legal e ilegal. Evitar la corrupcion en
   la red de comercio que permea en el mundo llevara decadas, si alguna vez
   puede lograrse. Entonces sera muy tarde para los elefantes africanos
   silvestres considerando las tasas actuales de declinacion. Si hemos de
   conservar poblaciones silvestres remanentes, debemos cerrar todos los
   mercados porque, con los niveles de corrupcion actuales, no pueden ser
   controlados de manera que no proporcionen oportunidades para que el
   marfil ilegal sea lavado hacia mercados legales.},

Abstract = {The conservation of wild fisheries resources in the face of an
   ever-increasing world demand for seafood requires the use of a number of
   management tools, including no-take zones, and gear, species, and
   temporal restrictions. One way of enforcing some of these regulations is
   through the use of Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data that provides
   enforcement officers with the position of fishing vessels in the
   management area. The increasing volume of movement data collected using
   VMS calls for new methods that could help analysts extract useful
   knowledge from these large data sets. Various approaches have been
   proposed for visualizing and exploring movement data and detecting
   patterns within these data, but those approaches have generally not been
   tested in a real-world context or compared together, making their actual
   usability and utility unclear. This paper describes, compares, and
   assesses three such approaches in the context of fisheries enforcement:
   an existing system used for fisheries enforcement operations in Canada
   (VUE), a novel Hybrid Spatio-temporal Filtering (HSF) system developed
   by the authors, and an automated Behavioural Change Point Analysis
   (BCPA) system. A field trial was conducted with experienced fisheries
   enforcement officers to compare and contrast the benefits and drawbacks
   of the three approaches. While all three presented advantages and
   disadvantages, the interactivity of VUE and HSF were identified as
   desirable features, as they provide analysts with more control over the
   data, while allowing flexible data exploration. BCPA, while providing an
   automated approach to the data analysis, was pointed out as being too
   much of a ``black box{''}, causing unease among the experts who require
   a level of transparency similar to that of legally admissible evidence.
   In the end, the experts suggested that the best approach would be to
   merge the analytical power of their existing VUE system with the
   exploratory power of the HSF system. This study provides insight into
   the value of using interactive mapping and filtering approaches in
   support of data analysis in the context of fisheries enforcement.},

Title = {Can a habitat specialist survive urbanization? the case of the viscacha
   (Lagidium viscacia, Chinchillidae)},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Urban growth is a strong driver of habitat degradation and loss. In
   spite of that, a surprising diversity of native species may survive in
   urban areas. In the La Paz, Bolivia metropolitan area and surroundings,
   local populations of ``viscachas{''} (Lagidium viscacia) currently
   survive in small, isolated habitat patches. We assessed 13 study sites
   in 1999, 2003, and 2007 to document the effects of urban growth on L.
   viscacia habitats. Degree of disturbance at the study sites increased
   more between 1999 and 2003 than it did between 2003 and 2007 due to
   patterns of urban expansion. Using satellite imagery we determined that
   the urban area increased 566 ha (from 1987 to 2001) mostly due to
   southward urban area expansion down the valley where the best viscacha
   habitats were located. Occupied patch area decreased 74 \% between 1999
   and 2007, accompanied by significant increases in patch edge-to-area
   ratios. Currently L. viscacia populations in La Paz are experiencing a
   habitat attrition process. If a current urban expansion plan for La Paz
   is approved, about 75 \% of the remaining habitat may be lost to urban
   development in a short time, compromising the future viability of this
   species in the metropolitan area and surroundings. Environmental
   regulations to control urban growth of the La Paz metropolitan area are
   urgently required and constitute the only hope for the survival of L.
   viscacia in the city.},

Title = {The challenges of estimating the distribution of flight heights from
   telemetry or altimetry data},
Journal = {ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {BackgroundGlobal positioning systems (GPS) and altimeters are
   increasingly used to monitor vertical space use by aerial species, a key
   aspect of their ecological niche, that we need to know to manage our own
   use of the airspace, and to protect those species. However, there are
   various sources of error in flight height data ({''}height{''} above
   ground, as opposed to ``altitude{''} above a reference like the sea
   level). First the altitude is measured with a vertical error from the
   devices themselves. Then there is error in the ground elevation below
   the tracked animals, which translates into error in flight height
   computed as the difference between altitude and ground elevation.
   Finally, there is error in the horizontal position of the animals, which
   translates into error in the predicted ground elevation below the
   animals. We used controlled field trials, simulations, and the
   reanalysis of raptor case studies with state-space models to illustrate
   the effect of improper error management.ResultsErrors of a magnitude of
   20 m appear in benign conditions for barometric altimeters and GPS
   vertical positioning (expected to be larger in more challenging
   context). These errors distort the shape of the distribution of flight
   heights, inflate the variance in flight height, bias behavioural state
   assignments, correlations with environmental covariates, and airspace
   management recommendations. Improper data filters such as removing all
   negative flight height records introduce several biases in the remaining
   dataset, and preclude the opportunity to leverage unambiguous errors to
   help with model fitting. Analyses that ignore the variance around the
   mean flight height, e.g., those based on linear models of flight height,
   and those that ignore the variance inflation caused by telemetry errors,
   lead to incorrect inferences.ConclusionThe state-space modelling
   framework, now in widespread use by ecologists and increasingly often
   automatically implemented within on-board GPS data processing
   algorithms, makes it possible to fit flight models directly to the
   output of GPS devices, with minimal data pre-selection, and to analyse
   the full distribution of flight heights, not just the mean. In addition
   to basic research about aerial niches, behaviour quantification, and
   environmental interactions, we highlight the applied relevance of our
   recommendations for airspace management and the conservation of aerial
   wildlife.},

Title = {Effects of white-nose syndrome on regional population patterns of 3
   hibernating bat species},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1048-1059},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Hibernating bats have undergone severe recent declines across the
   eastern United States, but the cause of these regional-scale declines
   has not been systematically evaluated. We assessed the influence of
   white-nose syndrome (an emerging bat disease caused by the fungus
   Pseudogymnoascus destructans, formerly Geomyces destructans) on
   large-scale, long-term population patterns in the little brown myotis
   (Myotis lucifugus), the northern myotis (Myotis septentrionalis), and
   the tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus). We modeled population
   trajectories for each species on the basis of an extensive data set of
   winter hibernacula counts of more than 1 million individual bats from a
   4-state region over 13 years and with data on locations of hibernacula
   and first detections of white-nose syndrome at each hibernaculum. We
   used generalized additive mixed models to determine population change
   relative to expectations, that is, how population trajectories differed
   with a colony's infection status, how trajectories differed with
   distance from the point of introduction of white-nose syndrome, and
   whether declines were concordant with first local observation of the
   disease. Population trajectories in all species met at least one of the
   3 expectations, but none met all 3. Our results suggest, therefore, that
   white-nose syndrome has affected regional populations differently than
   was previously understood and has not been the sole cause of declines.
   Specifically, our results suggest that in some areas and species,
   threats other than white-nose syndrome are also contributing to
   population declines, declines linked to white-nose syndrome have spread
   across large geographic areas with unexpected speed, and the disease or
   other threats led to declines in bat populations for years prior to
   disease detection. Effective conservation will require further research
   to mitigate impacts of white-nose syndrome, renewed attention to other
   threats to bats, and improved surveillance efforts to ensure early
   detection of white-nose syndrome.
   Los Efectos del Si-ndrome de Nariz Blanca sobre los Patrones Regionales
   de Poblacin de Tres Especies de Murcielagos que Hibernan Los murcielagos
   que hibernan han experimentado declinaciones severas recientes a lo
   largo del este de los Estados Unidos pero la causa de estas
   declinaciones a escala regional no ha sido evaluada sistematicamente.
   Valoramos la influencia del sindrome de nariz blanca (una enfermedad
   emergente de los murcielagos causada por el hongo Pseudogymnoascus
   destructans, antes Geomyces destructans) en el myotis cafe (Myotis
   lucifugs), el myotis del norte (M. septentrionalis) y el murcielago
   tricolor (Perimyotis subflavus). Modelamos las trayectorias
   poblacionales para cada especie con base en un conjunto extenso de datos
   de conteos de sitios de hibernacion de mas de un millon de murcielagos
   individuales en una region de cuatro estados durante mas de 13 anos y
   con datos sobre las localidades de los sitios de hibernacion y las
   primeras detecciones del sindrome de nariz blanca en cada sitio de
   hibernacion. Usamos modelos aditivos mixtos generalizados para
   determinar el cambio poblacional en relacion a las expectativas, es
   decir, como las trayectorias poblacionales difirieron con el estado de
   infeccion de una colonia, como difirieron con la distancia desde el
   punto de introduccion del sindrome de nariz blanca y si las
   declinaciones fueron concordantes con la primera observacion local de la
   enfermedad. Las trayectorias poblacionales de todas las especies
   cumplieron con al menos una de las tres expectativas, pero ninguna
   cumplio con las tres. Nuestros resultados sugieren que el sindrome de
   nariz blanca ha afectado a las poblaciones regionales de maneras
   diferentes a como se entendia previamente y no ha sido la causa unica de
   las declinaciones. Especificamente, nuestros resultados sugieren que en
   algunas areas y en algunas especies, otras amenazas ademas del sindrome
   de nariz blanca tambien estan contribuyendo a las declinaciones
   poblacionales, que las declinaciones conectadas al sindrome de nariz
   blanca se han esparcido en extensas areas geograficas con una velocidad
   inesperada, y que la enfermedad y otras amenazas resultaron en
   declinaciones de la poblacion de murcielagos durante anos previos a la
   deteccion. La conservacion efectiva requerira de una investigacion mas
   profunda para mitigar los impactos del sindrome de nariz blanca, de una
   atencion renovada a las otras amenazas y de esfuerzos mejorados de
   vigilancia para asegurar la deteccion temprana del sindrome de nariz
   blanca. Resumen},

Title = {Plant-derived utility products: knowledge comparison across gender, age

Abstract = {Background: Plant-derived utility products (PDPs) play an important role
   in sustaining humans, especially tribal communities. Despite this,
   knowledge on PDPs is declining.
   Methods: The present study was therefore carried to document the PDPs
   used by Bhangalis, a tribal community of western Himalaya, through
   door-to-door surveys (n=420) and detailed questionnaire recordings
   (n=240). In addition to taxonomic richness, frequency of species used;
   use value (UV), use diversity (UD), and cultural importance index (CI)
   were also analysed. Knowledge comparison between genders, four
   identified age groups (group 1: 16-32 years, group 2: 33-49 years, group
   3: 50-66 years, group 4: >66 years), and level of education of the
   respondents was also carried out using multiple regression in SPSS.
   Results: Bhangalis reported 55 PDPs under five use categories namely
   tools (34), artefacts (7), construction and storage (6 each), and
   miscellaneous (2). For making these PDPs, 20 plant species representing
   12 families were used. Picea smithiana (16.54\%), Cedrus deodara
   (14.96\%), Cotoneaster bacillaris (12.60\%) and Quercus semecarpifolia
   (11.02\%) reported the highest use frequency. On an average 15.13 +/-
   0.25 PDPs per respondent was noted. Similarly, Picea smithiana
   (UV=0.088) and Cedrus deodara (UV=0.079) reported the highest UV when
   compared to other species. Amongst all the species, maximum UD was
   revealed for Juglans regia in the tool category (0.91). On the other
   hand, maximum CI was also recorded for Picea smithiana (CITotal=2.91).
   With respect to gender, males were found to be more knowledgeable than
   females (B=6.370, p=0.001). Amongst the four age groups, respondents in
   group 1 (B=-13.302, p=0.001) and group 2 (B=-5.867, p=0.001) were less
   knowledgeable in comparison to respondents in the third and fourth age
   groups. Similarly, education also had a significant negative coefficient
   (B=0.275, p=0.037), with educated respondents having lesser knowledge.
   It was observed that alternates available in the market seem to be
   limiting the use of PDPs.
   Conclusions: Bhangalis still use PDPs that have a crucial role in their
   lifestyle. However, their use is declining. A multipronged strategy that
   not only focusses on socio-economic characteristics but also on
   awareness especially at school levels is desired.},

Title = {Network Analysis of Translocated Takahe Populations to Identify Disease
   Surveillance Targets},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Social network analysis is being increasingly used in epidemiology and
   disease modeling in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. We
   investigated this tool in describing a translocation network (area that
   allows movement of animals between geographically isolated locations)
   used for the conservation of an endangered flightless rail, the Takahe
   (Porphyrio hochstetteri). We collated records of Takahe translocations
   within New Zealand and used social network principles to describe the
   connectivity of the translocation network. That is, networks were
   constructed and analyzed using adjacency matrices with values based on
   the tie weights between nodes. Five annual network matrices were created
   using the Takahe data set, each incremental year included records of
   previous years. Weights of movements between connected locations were
   assigned by the number of Takahe moved. We calculated the number of
   nodes (i(total)) and the number of ties (t(total)) between the nodes. To
   quantify the small-world character of the networks, we compared the real
   networks to random graphs of the equivalent size, weighting, and node
   strength. Descriptive analysis of cumulative annual Takahe movement
   networks involved determination of node-level characteristics, including
   centrality descriptors of relevance to disease modeling such as weighted
   measures of in degree (k(i)(in)), out degree (k(i)(out)), and
   betweenness (B-i). Key players were assigned according to the highest
   node measure of k(i)(in), k(i)(out), and B-i per network. Networks
   increased in size throughout the time frame considered. The network had
   some degree small-world characteristics. Nodes with the highest
   cumulative tie weights connecting them were the captive breeding center,
   the Murchison Mountains and 2 offshore islands. The key player
   fluctuated between the captive breeding center and the Murchison
   Mountains. The cumulative networks identified the captive breeding
   center every year as the hub of the network until the final network in
   2011. Likewise, the wild Murchison Mountains population was consistently
   the sink of the network. Other nodes, such as the offshore islands and
   the wildlife hospital, varied in importance over time. Common network
   descriptors and measures of centrality identified key locations for
   targeting disease surveillance. The visual representation of movements
   of animals in a population that this technique provides can aid decision
   makers when they evaluate translocation proposals or attempt to control
   a disease outbreak. Analisis de Redes de Poblaciones de Takahe
   Translocadas para Identificar Objetivos de Supervivencia a Enfermedades
   Resumen El analisis de redes sociales actualmente se usa cada vez mas en
   la epidemiologia y el modelado de enfermedades en humanos, animales
   domesticos y vida silvestre. Investigamos esta herramienta en la
   descripcion de una red de translocacion (un area que permite el
   movimiento de animales entre localidades aisladas geograficamente) usada
   para la conservacion de un calamon no volador en peligro de extincion,
   el Takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri). Cotejamos registros de
   translocaciones de Takahe dentro de Nueva Zelanda y usamos los
   principios de las redes sociales para describir la conectividad de la
   red de translocacion. Esto quiere decir que las redes se construyeron y
   analizaron usando matrices de proximidad con valores basados en los
   pesos de union entre nodos. Se crearon cinco matrices de redes anuales
   usando el juego de datos del Takahe, cada ano incremental incluyo
   registros de anos previos. Se asigno el peso de los movimientos entre
   localidades conectadas dependiendo del numero de Takahe que se movian.
   Calculamos el numero total de nodos (i(total)) y el numero de uniones
   (t(total)) entre los nodos. Para cuantificar la caracteristica de
   pequeno mundo de las redes, comparamos al azar a las redes verdaderas
   con graficas de tamano equivalente, peso y fuerza de nodo. El analisis
   descriptivo del movimiento acumulativo anual de Takake involucro la
   determinacion de las caracteristicas del nivel del nodo, incluyendo
   descriptores de centralidad de relevancia para el modelado de
   enfermedades como medidas valoradas de grado interno (k(i)(in)), grado
   externo (k(i)(out)) y entre-distancia (B-i). Los factores determinantes
   se asignaron de acuerdo a la medida mas alta de nodo de Key k(i)(in),
   k(i)(out) y B-i por red. Las redes incrementaron en tamano a lo largo
   del marco de tiempo que se considero. La red tuvo cierto grado de
   caracteristicas de pequeno mundo. Los nodos conectados por los pesos de
   union acumulativos mas altos fueron los del centro de reproduccion en
   cautiverio, y las Montanas Murchison y dos islas. La parte determinante
   fluctuo entre el centro de reproduccion en cautiverio y las Montanas
   Murchison. Las redes acumulativas identificaron al centro de
   reproduccion en cautiverio cada ano como el centro de la red hasta la
   red final en 2011. La poblacion silvestre de las Montanas Murchison fue
   constantemente el vertedero de la red. Otros nodos, como las islas y el
   hospital de vida silvestre, variaron en importancia con respecto al
   tiempo. Los descriptores comunes de red y las medidas de centralidad
   identificaron localidades claves para enfocarse en la supervivencia a la
   enfermedad. La representacion visual de los movimientos de los animales
   en una poblacion que esta tecnica proporciona puede ayudar a los
   tomadores de decisiones cuando tengan que evaluar propuestas de
   translocacion o intenten controlar un brote de enfermedad.},

Abstract = {The study analyzes the coastline oscillations and land use and land
   cover (LULC) change due to the impact of the cyclone Fani in
   Balukhand-Konark Wildlife Sanctuary (BKWS), located in East India. In
   this study, two Landsat 8 images in the pre- and post-cyclone periods in
   2019 were used. The transition zone discriminating land and water was
   calculated using normalized difference water index (NDWI) and desktop
   digitization. The digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS), an extension
   of ArcGIS, was used to model changes in the shorelines, and the net
   shoreline movement (NSM) was used to extract the change statistics. The
   vegetation damage was analyzed using the soil-adjusted vegetation index
   (SAVI) and the LULC changes were assessed using geospatial techniques.
   Then, LULC degradation maps were produced. The results highlight the
   dynamic character of the studied coastline with erosion in the flat
   sandy forests, and show that some areas had accretion in the northern
   portion. The results show that SAVI has decreased along with patches
   close to critical erosion points, regardless of climate trends. It was
   observed that the severe cyclonic storm Fani had created both ecological
   and physical disturbances in the sandy flat BKWS area. In the future,
   this study can provide important information on ecological and physical
   changes induced by cyclonic storms and be beneficial for restoring the
   biodiversity niche of this unique fragile coastal forest on the east
   coast of India.},

Title = {Room to move? Threatened shorebird habitat in the path of sea level
   rise-dynamic beaches, multiple users, and mixed ownership: a case study
   from Rhode Island, USA},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {17},

Pages = {339-350},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Accelerated sea level rise (slr) is expected to transform vulnerable
   Atlantic coastal habitats in the United States during this century.
   Low-elevation sandy beaches, important nesting habitat for the continued
   recovery of the federally threatened piping plover (Charadrius melodus)
   in Rhode Island, are especially vulnerable. These beaches, under a mix
   of private and public ownership, exist in a heterogeneous landscape of
   dunes, rocky headlands, salt ponds, and heavily developed areas.
   Understanding the extent to which piping plover nesting beaches can
   retreat landward under projected slr is important for prioritizing
   future conservation actions across multiple jurisdictions. This research
   examines habitat change in response to slr (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 m) under
   stationary and migration beach responses and whether development blocks
   habitat migration for five productive piping plover nesting beaches. We
   found that under the stationary habitat model, all beaches lose area
   under all slr scenarios. For the habitat migration model, future habitat
   availability differs by beach depending on elevation, landward
   topography, and presence of development. However, across the majority of
   beach area, piping plover habitat will be able to migrate landward if
   unconstrained by future development. A coalition of public and private
   stakeholders already supports management efforts to help ensure plover
   population recovery in the area. With emerging habitat change prediction
   tools, these stakeholders and other partners can engage in innovative,
   local-level planning needed to protect wildlife habitat and commercial,
   residential, and infrastructure assets from sea level rise.},

Title = {The potential relative resilience of coral reefs in Wakatobi as a

Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {995-1004},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The main objectives of this study are to determine the potential for
   relative resilience, identify the drivers of potential resilience and
   priority locations for resilience-based coral reef management in
   Wakatobi. Data collection locations are spread across four major
   Wakatobi islands: Wangi Wangi, Kaledupa, Tomia, and Binongko at 5 m
   depth respectively. Coral reefs resilience assessment in Wakatobi
   consists of several stages: selecting indicators, collecting and
   compiling data, analyzing data, and identifying management targets. The
   highest potential for relative resilience in Wakatobi are station 15
   with a value of 1.00 and the lowest is station 8 with a value of 0.69.
   Relative resilience in high category is 2 stations, med-high 7 stations,
   med-low 2 stations, and low 4 stations. Relative resilience in high
   category is able to be distinguished by the high values of bleaching
   resistant, herbivore biomass, coral cover, and supported by a high
   diversity of coral. The mid-high category is grouped by the contribution
   of indicator values coming from coral recruitment and coral diversity,
   as well as followed by two other indicators such as coral cover and alga
   cover. Last, the mid-low category and low category tend to be pushed by
   the low values of coral disease and followed by some other indicators
   like algae cover. Resilience approach to identify prioritizing stations
   for management actions is conservation (2 station), fishery management
   and enforcement (5 station), bleaching monitoring and supporting
   recovery (3 station), coral reef restoration (2 tation), tourism
   structuring (10 station), and Land-based sources of pollution reduction
   (5 station).},

Title = {Public perceptions of marine environmental issues: A case study of
   coastal recreational users in Italy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Marine environments provide ecosystem services jeopardised by human
   activities, resulting in impacts requiring urgent attention. In Europe
   and southern Mediterranean countries like Italy, marine environmental
   problems of note include marine litter, overfishing and climate change,
   among others. Public engagement is essential in mitigating these
   problems. In this context, investigating public perceptions and what
   influences these perceptions is necessary to design the right public
   engagement strategies. This study evaluated perceptions of marine
   environmental issues among coastal recreational users along the Conero
   Riviera in the Adriatic Sea. This is a location used for many coastal
   activities, affected by several human impacts and considered to become a
   marine protected area. A total of 202 coastal recreational users were
   interviewed regarding their perceptions of marine environmental issues
   including awareness, concern, observed changes in the local coast, and
   pro-environmental behaviours to combat marine environmental issues.
   Regression analysis was used to determine influential variables in
   perceptions. The participants were mainly aware of and concerned about
   issues including pollution, litter and overfishing. They had observed
   changes in the local coast primarily encompassing wildlife reduction,
   toxic algal growth and mucilage. They engaged in pro-environmental
   behaviours principally including recycling, litter collection and
   pollution reduction. Awareness of marine environmental issues influenced
   concern, while the observation of coastal changes and pro-environmental
   behaviours were mainly influenced by demographic variables like water
   use and gender. The results of this study were used to make
   recommendations concerning the design of communication and education
   campaigns and strategies to stimulate pro-environmental behaviours to
   support marine conservation.},
