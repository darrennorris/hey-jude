AN IMPORTANT CORNERSTONE OF NATURA 2000 IS THE HABITATS DIRECTIVE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED ACROSS EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES. HOWEVER, STRAIGHTFORWARD IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT OBVIOUS SINCE THE FAVOURABLE CONSERVATION STATUS OF HABITATS AND SPECIES NEEDS TO BE ACHIEVED AT THE MEMBER STATE LEVEL, WHILE CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES NEED TO BE FORMULATED AT THE PROTECTED SITE LEVEL. TO BRIDGE THIS GAP, WE PROPOSE TO START FROM REGIONAL CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES BEFORE SITE LEVEL OBJECTIVES ARE FORMULATED. THESE REGIONAL CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK ACCORDING TO WHICH CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES CAN BE ALLOCATED BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE PROTECTED SITES OF THE NATURA 2000 NETWORK. ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL OR REGIONAL CONSERVATION STATUS. RECENTLY, FLANDERS (NORTHERN BELGIUM) HAS ADOPTED THIS APPROACH AND HAS QUANTIFIED CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES AT THE REGIONAL SCALE. AS THE CURRENT REGIONAL CONSERVATION STATUS OF HABITATS AND SPECIES IS MOSTLY UNFAVOURABLE, REGIONAL CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES ENTAIL A DRASTIC INCREASE IN AREA (42\%) FOR HABITATS, AND ACTIVE CONSERVATION MEASURES FOR 78\% OF THE SPECIES. WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THE METHOD OUTLINED HERE, MAY SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO A HELPFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT IMPLEMENTING AND STREAMLINING NATURA 2000 ACROSS EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES.

THUS, PRESERVING WILDLIFE HABITATS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES REPRESENTS A CHALLENGING MISSION. AS A MEASURE TO PROMOTE CONSERVATION, IN RECENT YEARS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ISSUED VERY STRICT LAWS AND REGULATIONS TOGETHER WITH EXTENSIVE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND PROPAGANDA DIRECTIVES. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH PARTICULAR APPROACH, AN ASSESSMENT OF MISHMI TAKIN (BUDORCAS TAXICOLOR) IN MT. GAOLIGONG NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE WAS CARRIED OUT. USING DATA COLLECTED BY INTERVIEWING LOCAL RESIDENTS, LITERATURE REVIEW AND FIELD SURVEY, WE ANALYZED THE DYNAMIC PROFILES OF POPULATION SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION ALTERATION OF THIS ENDANGERED SPECIES IN CHINA. THE TEMPORAL COMPARISON OF THE PROFILES WAS ORGANIZED IN 3 PERIODS: PRE-1980S (BEFORE THE SETTING UP OF THE RESERVE), 1980-2000 AND AFTER THE 2000S. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT, AFTER THE CREATION OF THE PARK, TAKIN INDIVIDUALS WERE SIGHTED MORE FREQUENTLY WITHIN THE RESERVE AREAS AND THE DISTRIBUTION RANGE INCREASED. MAIN ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES CAME FROM HUNTING, WHICH WAS BANNED IN 1980, AS WELL AS FROM THE DEPLETION AND COLLECTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. THESE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE A REPRESENTATIVE CASE OF SUCCESSFUL CONSERVATION POLICY IN THE PARTICULAR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT OF CHINA, IMPLEMENTED WITH AUTHORITATIVE LEGISLATION COUPLED WITH EDUCATION AND AWARENESS PLANS, UNDER VERY CONSTRAINED FINANCIAL AND MANPOWER RESOURCES SUPPORT. MOREOVER, THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS AN ECONOMIC AND CONVENIENT, YET EFFECTIVE SURVEY METHOD IDEAL FOR RESEARCH IN REMOTE REGIONS CHARACTERIZED BY ACCESS DIFFICULTIES DUE TO HIGH MOUNTAINS, DEEP VALLEYS, AND HARSH ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS THE QINGHAI-TIBET PLATEAU AND THE HENGDUAN MOUNTAINS.

THIRD, WE COMPARED THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES BETWEEN OFFSPRING BORN IN CAPTIVITY AND THEIR MOTHERS. WE FOUND THAT THE DIETARY SPECIALIST, N. STEPHENSI, LOST A GREATER PROPORTION OF ITS NATIVE GUT MICROBIOTA AND OVERALL DIVERSITY IN RESPONSE TO CAPTIVITY COMPARED WITH N. ALBIGULA. ADDITION OF THE NATURAL DIET INCREASED THE PROPORTION OF THE ORIGINAL MICROBIOTA BUT DID NOT RESTORE OVERALL DIVERSITY IN N. STEPHENSI. OFFSPRING OF N. ALBIGULA MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLED THEIR MOTHERS COMPARED WITH OFFSPRING-MOTHER PAIRS OF N. STEPHENSI. THIS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE MICROBIOTA OF DIETARY SPECIALISTS MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CAPTIVITY. FURTHERMORE, THIS WORK HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR FURTHER STUDIES INVESTIGATING THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING HOW LOSS OF MICROBIAL DIVERSITY MAY VARY BETWEEN HOSTS AND WHAT AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF DIVERSITY LOSS MAY BE TO A HOST. THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL AID CONSERVATION BIOLOGISTS IN DESIGNING CAPTIVE BREEDING PROGRAMMES EFFECTIVE AT MAINTAINING MICROBIAL DIVERSITY.

WE USED A LARGE-SCALE SPATIOTEMPORAL STUDY COMBINED WITH AN EXTENSIVE RED FOX REMOVAL INTERVENTION TO TEST THESE TWO HYPOTHESES BY EVALUATING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE RECOLONIZATION OF ARCTIC FOXES IN NORTHERN NORWAY. ARCTIC FOXES WERE NEVER OBSERVED AT SITES WHERE JUST A FEW DAILY OBSERVATIONS OF RED FOXES WERE RECORDED, AND THE PROBABILITY OF RECOLONIZATION WAS ZERO AT SITES WHERE NO RED FOX WAS REMOVED. THE PROBABILITY OF RECOLONIZATION INCREASED WHEN LEMMING ABUNDANCE WAS VERY HIGH, BUT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THIS VARIABLE WAS HALF THAT OF RED FOXES. THUS, OUR RESULTS LEND SUPPORT TO BOTH HYPOTHESES, BUT THEY CLEARLY HIGHLIGHT THE PRESENCE OF RED FOXES AS THE FACTOR MOST LIMITING ARCTIC FOX RECOLONIZATION IN THIS PART OF ITS DISTRIBUTION. AS THE ABUNDANCE OF ARCTIC FOXES HAS REMAINED EXTREMELY LOW EVEN AFTER MORE THAN 70 YEARS OF FULL PROTECTION, DIRECT CONSERVATION ACTIONS SEEM TO BE NEEDED TO PROMOTE THE RECOVERY OF ARCTIC FOX POPULATIONS.

TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF MOUNTAIN GOAT AND RECREATIONAL USE, VEGETATION MONITORING WAS INITIATED BY THE USDA FOREST SERVICE IN 2016. WE USED 5 Y MONITORING DATA (2016-2020) AND GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS TO ANALYZE THE SEPARATE AND INTERACTING EFFECTS OF YEAR, RECREATIONAL USE, AND MOUNTAIN GOAT USE ON: (1) POPULATIONS OF PLANT SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN; (2) VASCULAR AND NONVASCULAR PLANT COVER; AND (3) GROUND COVER. OUR ANALYSES REVEALED DECREASES IN PROPORTIONAL FREQUENCY OF E. MANCUS AT THE END OF THE MONITORING. PROPORTIONAL COVER OF DOMINANT PLANT GROWTH FORMS, ESPECIALLY FORBS, DECLINED, WHILE PROPORTIONAL COVER OF LITTER AND INEFFECTIVE GROUND COVER (BARE SOIL AND PAVEMENT) INCREASED. RECREATIONAL OR GOAT USE WERE A FACTOR IN SEVERAL OF THE OBSERVED CHANGES, ALTHOUGH WEATHER AND CLIMATE LIKELY ALSO INFLUENCED THE RESULTS. MANAGEMENT COMPLEXITY ARISES BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT MISSIONS OF USDA FOREST SERVICE AND UDWR, BUT ADJUSTMENTS IN MOUNTAIN GOAT NUMBERS AND RECREATIONAL USE MAY BE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN ECOLOGICALLY RESILIENT ECOSYSTEMS.

BASED ON THE TIME PERIOD DURING WHICH FREE-FLOATING TURTLE CARCASSES TETHERED NEARSHORE WERE BUOYANT, WE DETERMINED THAT OCEANIC DRIFT DURATION OF TURTLE CARCASSES WAS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON WATER TEMPERATURE AND VARIED FROM 2 TO 15 DAYS DURING TYPICAL LATE SPRING TO EARLY FALL BAY WATER CONDITIONS. THE IMPORTANCE OF DIRECT WIND FORCING FOR TURTLE CARCASS DRIFT WAS ASSESSED BASED ON TRACK DIVERGENCE RATES FROM MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS DEPLOYMENTS OF THREE TYPES OF SURFACE DRIFTERS: BUCKET DRIFTERS, ARTIFICIAL TURTLES AND TURTLE CARCASS DRIFTERS. TURTLE DRIFT ALONG-WIND LEEWAY WAS FOUND TO VARY FROM 1 TO 4\% OF WIND SPEED, REPRESENTING AN ADDED DRIFT VELOCITY OF APPROXIMATELY 0.03-0.1 M/S FOR TYPICAL BAY WIND CONDITIONS. THIS IS COMPARABLE TO CURRENT SPEEDS IN THE BAY (0.1-0.2 M/S), SUGGESTING WIND IS IMPORTANT FOR CARCASS DRIFT. ESTIMATED CARCASS DRIFT PARAMETERS WERE INTEGRATED INTO A CHESAPEAKE BAY OCEANOGRAPHIC DRIFT MODEL TO PREDICT CARCASS DRIFT TO TERRESTRIAL STRANDING LOCATIONS. INCREASED DRIFT DURATION (E.G., DUE TO LOW TEMPERATURES) INCREASES MEAN DISTANCE BETWEEN EXPECTED MORTALITY EVENTS AND STRANDING LOCATIONS, AS WELL AS DECREASES OVERALL LIKELIHOOD OF RETENTION IN THE BAY. PROBABLE MORTALITY HOTSPOTS FOR THE PEAK MONTH OF STRANDINGS (JUNE) WERE IDENTIFIED OFF COASTAL SOUTHEASTERN VIRGINIA AND WITHIN THE LOWER BAY, INCLUDING THE BAY MOUTH AND LOWER JAMES RIVER.

THE AFT-SOIL BEHIND WALLS PROVIDES CATCHMENT FOR NORMAL ROOT FUNCTIONS. BEGINNING AS PIONEERS AND PERSISTING AS CLIMAX MEMBERS, THEY SHORT-CIRCUIT THE SERAL PROCESSES. WALL-GRIPPING CAPABILITY AS LARGE EPILITHIC WOODY HEMI-EPIPHYTES IS DUE TO THE STRANGLER-FIG HABIT, AN EVOLUTIONARY TRAIT THAT ORIGINATED IN THE TROPICAL FOREST. THE POLYMORPHIC ROOTS WITH MORPHOLOGICAL PLASTICITY AND SELF-GRAFTING ABILITY, AND THEIR MULTIPLE MODES OF INTERACTIONS WITH WALL NICHES, ACCOUNT FOR FIRM ATTACHMENT ON THE VERTICAL HABITAT AND EXPLORATION OF PROXIMAL SOILS. A MODEL OF STRANGLER-FIG GROWTH ON STONE WALLS SERVING AS SURROGATE HOST TREE IS DEVELOPED. THE DIVERSE AND VERSATILE ROOTING MODES ARE THE BASIS TO SUSTAIN STRANGLER-FIG WALL CONDITIONS TO PERMIT CONTINUATION OF STRANGLER-FIG HABIT. SUCH UNIQUE NATURE-IN-CITY AND NATURAL-CUM-CULTURAL GEMS DESERVE CONSERVATION AS URBAN ECOLOGICAL HERITAGE."

IN ADDITION TO THEIR IMPORTANCE, ANIMALS HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN RELIGION, ART, MUSIC AND LITERATURE AND SEVERAL OTHER DIFFERENT CULTURAL MANIFESTATIONS OF MANKIND. HUMAN BEINGS ARE ACQUAINTED WITH USE OF ANIMALS FOR FOODSTUFF, CLOTH, MEDICINE, ETC. SINCE ANCIENT TIMES. HUGE WORK HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT ON ETHNOBOTANY AND TRADITIONAL MEDICINE. ANIMAL AND THEIR PRODUCTS ARE ALSO HOLDING MEDICINAL PROPERTIES THAT CAN BE EXPLOITED FOR THE BENEFIT OF HUMAN BEINGS LIKE PLANTS. IN TANZANIA, MANY TRIBAL COMMUNITIES ARE SPREAD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL TOTALLY DEPENDED ON LOCAL CUSTOMARY MEDICINAL SYSTEM FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE. IN THE WORLD TANZANIA IS GIFTED WITH WIDE RANGE OF FLORAL AND FAUNAL BIODIVERSITY. THE USE OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE FROM ANIMALS BY SUKUMA ETHNIC GROUP OF BUSEGA DISTRICT IS THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY. METHOD: IN ORDER TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION ON ETHNOZOOLOGICAL USE ABOUT ANIMAL AND THEIR PRODUCTS PREDOMINANT AMONG THIS TRIBE IN BUSEGA DISTRICT, A STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT FROM AUGUST 2012, TO JULY 2013. DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE AND OPEN INTERVIEW WITH 180 (118 MALE AND 62 FEMALES) SELECTED PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE FROM WHOM THE DATA WERE COLLECTED COMPRISE OLD AGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS, TRADITIONAL HEALTH PRACTICENER, FISHERMEN AND CULTURAL OFFICERS. THE NAME OF ANIMAL AND OTHER ETHNOZOOLOGICAL INFORMATION WERE DOCUMENTED. PICTURES AND DISCUSSION WERE ALSO RECORDED WITH THE HELP OF CAMERA AND VOICE RECORDER. RESULT: A TOTAL OF 42 VARIOUS ANIMAL SPECIES WERE USED IN NEARLY 30 DIFFERENT MEDICINAL PURPOSES INCLUDING STD, STOPPAGE OF BLEEDING, REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS, ASTHMA, WEAKNESS, TUBERCULOSIS, COUGH, PARALYSIS AND WOUND AND FOR OTHER RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. IT HAS BEEN NOTICED THAT ANIMAL USED BY SUKUMA TRIBE, COMPRISE OF SEVENTEEN MAMMALS, SEVEN BIRDS, FOUR REPTILES, EIGHT ARTHROPODS AND TWO MOLLUSKS. SOME OF THE PROTECTED SPECIES WERE ALSO USED AS IMPORTANT MEDICINAL RESOURCES. WE ALSO FOUND THAT COUGH, TUBERCULOSIS, ASTHMA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY DISEASES ARE THE UTMOST CITED DISEASE, AS SUCH, A NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINES ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE TREATMENT. CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT WORK INDICATES THAT 42 ANIMAL SPECIES WERE BEING USED TO TREAT NEARLY 30 DIFFERENT AILMENTS AND RESULTS SHOW THAT ETHNOZOOLOGICAL PRACTICES ARE AN IMPORTANT ALTERNATIVE MEDICINAL PRACTICE BY THE SUKUMA TRIBE LIVING IN BUNGESA DISTRICT. THE PRESENT STUDY ALSO INDICATES THE VERY RICH ETHNOZOOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THESE PEOPLE IN RELATION TO TRADITIONAL MEDICINE.

CONSERVATION PRIORITIZATION FOR THESE SPECIES SHARES GREATER SIMILARITY WITH INVASIVE SPECIES RISK ASSESSMENTS THAN EXTINCTION RISK ASSESSMENTS BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL CONTEXT AND PER CAPITA EFFECTS OF ABUNDANCE ON OTHER SPECIES. BECAUSE CONSERVATION PRIORITIES USUALLY FOCUS ON PREVENTING THE EXTINCTION OF THREATENED SPECIES, THE RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES FOR INCORPORATING DECLINES OF NONTHREATENED SPECIES MUST BE CLEARLY ARTICULATED, GOING BEYOND EXTINCTION RISK TO ENCOMPASS THE RANGE OF LIKELY HARMFUL EFFECTS (E.G., SECONDARY EXTINCTIONS, LOSS OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES) IF DECLINES PERSIST OR ARE NOT REVERSED. RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS ON CHARACTERIZING THE EFFECTS OF LOCAL DECLINES IN SPECIES THAT ARE NOT THREATENED GLOBALLY ACROSS A RANGE OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND QUANTIFYING THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THESE EFFECTS THROUGH THE DISTRIBUTION OF ABUNDANCE. THE CASE FOR CONSERVING ABUNDANCE IN NONTHREATENED SPECIES CAN BE MADE MOST POWERFULLY WHEN THE COSTS OF LOSING THIS ABUNDANCE ARE BETTER UNDERSTOOD."
