2334,2011,"Lemur bridges provide crossing structures over roads within a forested mining concession near Moramanga, Toamasina Province, Madagascar","Conservation Evidence","The Ambatovy Project includes a large, open-pit nickel mine located in Madagascar's eastern humid forest, and an associated pipeline to remove laterite slurry off site. The area is recognized for its high biodiversity exemplified by the presence of at least 13 lemur species in forests surrounding the mine site. In order to reduce potential habitat fragmentation impacts on the lemur populations as a consequence of recent access road construction, seven crossing structures (referred to as 'lemur bridges') were erected within the mine footprint area and along the slurry pipeline that will remain in place until rehabilitated forest allows for movement over roads via the forest canopy. Two bridge designs were used due to differences in road width and vehicle traffic type. Lemur bridges have been monitored since their construction in January-February 2009. To date (10 August 2010), bridges have been used by six lemur species. Mine footprint type bridges (suspension bridge design) have been used more frequently than slurry pipeline bridges (plank bridge design) and, overall, there has been an increase in bridge use in 2010 when compared to 2009 (from 8% to 24% of total observations where lemurs are present in proximity to bridges). These results suggest that although a certain time period may be required for lemurs to locate and habituate to bridges, these crossing structures offer an effective mitigation measure to assist in reducing the impacts of habitat fragmentation.",NA,"CE","CE_2334",226,0.157684795757446,0.0842531942457905,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

2350,2011,"Managing competition between birds and bats for roost boxes in small woodlands, north-east England","Conservation Evidence","A total of 196 bat boxes were installed between 2005 and 2009 across 21 sites throughout the Highways Agency's (HA) 'soft estate' woodland in north-east England in support of the HA's Biodiversity Action Plan. The woodlands are typically small linear blocks (<3 ha) with trees mostly less than 40 years of age. Suitable natural cavity sites are thus very limited, hence the attractiveness of bat boxes as a conservation measure to enhance these woodland habitats. Monitoring in 2006-2007 had shown that in some areas (seven woodland sites) over 40% of bat boxes were being used by nesting passerine birds. Bird boxes were installed in an attempt to reduce bird occupancy of bat boxes. Provision of bird boxes significantly reduced bird use of bat boxes (a 50% overall reduction in occupancy) thus potentially making more bat boxes available for bat use. We also assessed if there was any relationship between the number/density of available bat boxes and level of bat occupancy to assess if there was a limit to the occupancy levels that could be achieved, thus determining an approach that could maximise benefits and cost effectiveness of box installation. Occupancy of bat boxes by bats appears not to increase above 30% utilisation with an increasing number of boxes on site after eight boxes. This suggests that, as bat boxes are installed three boxes per tree (as per best practice guidelines), the optimal number to install would generally be between nine to 12 boxes in these small woodland areas.",NA,"CE","CE_2350",239,0.211846702380273,0.152244958290262,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

An adder bank (hibernacula) was constructed in the autumn 2009 in advance of flood defence works at Horsey in 2010 to mitigate any temporary loss of hibernation and natal den sites. Reptile fencing was erected around the adder banks and some adjacent grazing marshes in February 2010 to create reptile enclosures. During March to May 2010, 119 adders were moved to the adder banks from the flood banks that were then stripped of vegetation and topsoil to discourage animals from re-entering the working corridor. Sections of the adder fencing were removed in mid-May to allow animals to disperse to their summer foraging grounds. Surveys during summer 2010 indicated breeding success within the banks. Pre hibernation surveys in 2010 recorded a peak count of 22 animals, and a spring emergence survey of the adder bank in 2011 identified 17 individual adders. A further four were recorded using an adjacent store of rush, Juncus, bales. Monitoring through summer and autumn 2011 identified a further 16 individual animals on or close to the adder bank, including six gravid adders. Eighteen out of the 33 adders recorded using the adder banks in 2011 were recaptures. Fifteen 'new' adders (i.e. not relocated during the 2010 mitigation) were subsequently identified as using the adder banks to hibernate or give birth.

Given its vulnerability, it was considered desirable to establish additional sub-populations to ensure the long-term survival of the species. A spatial meta-population simulation of grand skinks at Macraes Flat suggested that this could be facilitated by the translocation of grand skinks into areas of predator protected habitat. Areas identified by modeling as suitable translocation sites were ground-truthed by an experienced survey team in 2008. In October 2009 we began a translocation trial. We moved nineteen grand skinks from three locations to the translocation site. The founder population was made up of ten juveniles and nine sexually mature grand skinks. Seasonal estimation of persistence and abundance using a photographic re-sight methodology allowed the short- and medium-term performance of the translocation to be assessed. High initial persistence rates suggested immediate homing was not a factor of concern. After one year, all translocated juveniles had persisted, but only four of the original nine adults remained at the release site. While the loss of adults was to some extent offset by the birth of the young-of-the-year (total skinks start: n = 19, finish: n = 20) there was a moderate loss of ~ 10% in terms of the population's expected reproductive value.

Risk of injury to endemic San Nicolas Island foxes Urocyon littoralis dickeyi, a similarly sized and more abundant non-target species, was mitigated by using a smaller trap size, modifying the trap and trap set to reduce injuries, and utilising a trap monitoring system to reduce time animals spent in traps. Impacts to foxes during the eradication campaign were further reduced by having a mobile veterinary hospital on island to treat injured foxes. Compared to other reported fox trapping efforts, serious injuries were reduced 2-7 times. Trapping efforts exceeded animal welfare standards, with 95% of fox captures resulting in minor or no injuries. Older foxes were more likely to receive serious injury. Fox captures were also reduced through aversive conditioning, with initial capture events providing a negative stimulus to prevent recaptures. Fox capture rates decreased up to six times during seven months of trapping, increasing trap availability for cats, and improving the efficacy of the cat eradication program. No aspect of the first capture event was significantly linked to the chance of recapture.",NA,"CE","CE_3574",199,0.300072018976626,-0.15726939820223,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

4789,2012,"Influence of conservation programs on amphibians using seasonal wetlands in the Prairie Pothole region","Wetlands","Extensive modification of upland habitats surrounding wetlands to facilitate agricultural production has negatively impacted amphibian communities in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America. In attempts to mitigate ecosystem damage associated with extensive landscape alteration, vast tracks of upland croplands have been returned to perennial vegetative cover (i.e., conservation grasslands) under a variety of U.S. Department of Agriculture programs. We evaluated the influence of these conservation grasslands on amphibian occupancy of seasonal wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region. Using automated call surveys, aquatic funnel traps, and visual encounter surveys, we detected eight amphibian species using wetlands within three land-use categories (farmed, conservation grasslands, and native prairie grasslands) during the summers of 2005 and 2006. Seasonal wetlands within farmlands were used less frequently by amphibians than those within conservation and native prairie grasslands, and wetlands within conservation grasslands were used less frequently than those within native prairie grasslands by all species and life-stages we successfully modeled. Our results suggest that, while not occupied as frequently as wetlands within native prairie, wetlands within conservation grasslands provide important habitat for maintaining amphibian biodiversity in the Prairie Pothole Region. © The Author(s) 2012.","10.1007/s13157-012-0269-9","CE","CE_4789",190,0.221662770850694,0.185484174620821,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
4801,2011,"Towards a better understanding of the use of probiotics for preventing chytridiomycosis in Panamanian golden frogs","EcoHealth","Populations of native Panamanian golden frogs (Atelopus zeteki) have collapsed due to a recent chytridiomycosis epidemic. Reintroduction efforts from captive assurance colonies are unlikely to be successful without the development of methods to control chytridiomycosis in the wild. In an effort to develop a protective treatment regimen, we treated golden frogs with Janthinobacterium lividum, a skin bacterium that has been used to experimentally prevent chytridiomycosis in North American amphibians. Although J. lividum appeared to colonize A. zeteki skin temporarily, it did not prevent or delay mortality in A. zeteki exposed to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the causative agent of chytridiomycosis. After introduction of J. lividum, average bacterial cell counts reached a peak of 1.7 × 10(6) cells per frog ~2 weeks after treatment but declined steadily after that. When J. lividum numbers declined to ~2.8 × 10(5) cells per frog, B. dendrobatidis infection intensity increased to greater than 13,000 zoospore equivalents per frog. At this point, frogs began to die of chytridiomycosis. Future research will concentrate on isolating and testing antifungal bacterial species from Panama that may be more compatible with Atelopus skin.","10.1007/s10393-012-0743-0","CE","CE_4801",173,0.229745752419762,-0.0323965287840276,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
4816,2012,"Postrelease movements of captive-reared Ozark hellbenders (<i>Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi</i>)","Herpetologica","Postrelease movements can determine the success of wildlife translocations. We monitored movements of 36 captive-reared Ozark Hellbenders (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi) released to augment wild populations at two sites on the North Fork of the White River (Missouri, USA). We used radiotelemetry to collect 3610 Hellbender locations from May 2008 to August 2009. We quantified movements at multiple spatio-temporal scales and made comparisons between two seasons of monitoring (1 = release-December 2008; 2 = January 2009-August 2009). At the finest (daily) scale, most Hellbenders (90%-94% per season) were highly sedentary (=50 of observations indicated no movement). Typical distances between daily locations when Hellbenders moved were 20 m between daily locations, and virtually all (34 of 35) such movements occurred in Season 1. At a broader scale, home ranges of Hellbenders varied widely in Season 1 (range = 0.66-986.92 m2, n = 26), but in Season 2 averaged only 31.33 m2 (± 11.81 SE, n = 8) and 11.08 m2 (± 3.25 SE, n = 7) at respective sites. Among Hellbenders monitored long enough to exhibit settlement (estimation of a home range) 69% (18 of 26) dispersed =50 m from the point of release. We only noted mortality associated with dispersals >50 m at one site, when it coincided with abandonment of core habitat that was one-third as large as at the other site. At the broadest scale, 68% and 86% of Hellbenders settled in core habitat of respective release sites, and most had settled within 21 d postrelease (range = 0-49 d). Collectively, Hellbender movements indicated a short period of exploration followed by more permanent settlement and high site fidelity typical of wild conspecifics. Captive-reared juvenile Hellbenders may be well suited for translocation; however, the quality of habitat at fine scale (10-30 m2) and the extent of suitable habitat within release sites are important considerations. © 2012 by The Herpetologists' League, Inc.","10.1655/HERPETOLOGICA-D-11-00033.1","CE","CE_4816",271,0.253833382691066,0.119634873448784,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
4817,2011,"Usefulness of volunteer data to measure the large scale decline of ââcommonââ toad populations","Biological Conservation","Measuring a species decline is pivotal to evaluate their conservation status, but an accurate assessment of demographic trends requires observations collected across broad spatial and temporal scales. Volunteers can help to collect information over large scales, but their data may be affected by heterogeneity for sampling efforts and protocols, which may influence detection probability. Ignoring this issue may conduct to misleading conclusions. Here we show that data collected by different volunteer groups can be integrated with measures of sampling efforts, to obtain information on large scale demographic trends. We collected data on 33 common toad (Bufo bufo) populations across Italy for the period 1993-2010. We used two approaches (meta-analysis; analysis of average change in population size) to evaluate the overall demographic trend. We incorporated measures of volunteer sampling efforts into analyses, to take into account changes in detection probability. Toad abundance significantly declined in the last decade. From 2000 to 2010, 70% of populations showed a strong decline, and only 10% increased. Trends were heterogeneous among populations, but taking into account sampling effort reduced heterogeneity by 40%. We detected a 76% cumulative average decline of toad populations, despite an increasing mean sampling effort. The widespread toad decline rises concern for its future, also because the causes remain unclear. Volunteer data can be extremely useful to identify large scale population trends, if information on sampling effort are recorded and used to adjust counts. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2011.06.011","CE","CE_4817",227,0.329332070010977,0.0108051226003773,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Amphibian species richness or abundance at created and restored wetlands was either similar to or greater than reference wetlands in 89% of studies. Use of created and restored wetlands by individual species was driven by aquatic and terrestrial habitat preferences, as well as ability to disperse from source wetlands.

This study evaluated the success of the restoration activities by examining anuran species richness and relative abundance in relation to various restoration treatments, which included restored areas, un-restored areas, and natural wetlands. Anuran observations were conducted using nocturnal audible call surveys and dip netting. Univariate results indicated that: the lowest species richness and relative abundance values occurred within the un-restored areas, richness significantly increased in all restored areas relative to un-restored areas, abundance increased in some restored areas but not others, and highest richness and abundance were documented in the natural wetlands. Multivariate analysis confirmed these patterns and also indicated that the anuran species assemblages were significantly different between restoration treatments. Furthermore, the presence or absence of Lithobates sphenocephalus utricularius (Southern Leopard Frog), Gastrophryne carolinensis (Eastern Narrow-mouthed Toad), and Hyla femoralis (Pine Woods Treefrog) may be used to document restoration success or hydrologic disturbance, respectively.

Many studies have examined the separate effects of such perturbations; however, few have examined the effects of simultaneous exposure of both to amphibians. In this study, we exposed larval southern leopard frog tadpoles (Lithobates sphenocephalus) to the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and the fungicide thiophanate-methyl (TM) at 0.6 mg/L under laboratory conditions. The experiment was continued until all larvae completed metamorphosis or died. Overall, TM facilitated increases in tadpole mass and length. Additionally, individuals exposed to both TM and Bd were heavier and larger, compared to all other treatments. TM also cleared Bd in infected larvae.

4922,2012,"Temporal changes in the relative abundance of amphibians relative to riparian buffer width in western Washington, USA","Forest Ecology and Management","In certain regions of Canada and the United States, amphibians have been shown to be sensitive to forest management and the short-term adverse effects of timber harvesting on terrestrial amphibians have been well documented in the literature. However, the effects of silvicultural treatments on amphibians may not be realized until many years after treatment. Manipulative forest management experiments with pre- and post-treatment data, random assignment of replicates to treatments, and analyses over a large spatial scale are rare in the literature. Furthermore, even studies with pre- and post-treatment data can be affected by ecological time lags; the longevity of some species may mean that it could take several years to observe a treatment effect. Riparian areas in forested landscapes of the Pacific Northwest have been recognized for high species richness of amphibians yet little is known about the persistence of amphibians in mature forest fragments such as unharvested riparian buffers surrounded by clearcuts. Our study investigated the efficacy, 2 and 10. years post-logging, of two different riparian management zone prescriptions established around third- and fourth-order streams in western Washington to mitigate the effects of upland timber harvest on amphibians. Our findings suggest that there is no global response by terrestrial amphibians to logging or to the retention of riparian management zones. Rather, species showed individual responses that varied over time and between treatments and transects. Specifically Coastal Tailed Frogs (. Ascaphus truei) declined in clearcut upland habitats 2- and 10-years following logging while Western Red-backed Salamander (. Plethodon vehiculum) and Ensatina (. Ensatina eschscholtzii) appear to benefit from the recommended riparian management zone width. The influence of site effects was evident for some species, whereas for others there is some suggestion of treatment effects, but the analyses were confounded by patterns of natural population change at both local and regional scales, which were evident 2. years following logging. Our results exemplify the need for longer-term studies to ensure that potentially confounding factors, such as natural population fluctuation, are considered when interpreting the results of time series data. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","10.1016/j.foreco.2012.02.015","CE","CE_4922",340,0.17561325628869,0.17134089520436,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
4979,2011,"Developing a safe antifungal treatment protocol to eliminate <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> from amphibians","Medical Mycology","Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is one of the most pathogenic microorganisms affecting amphibians in both captivity and in nature. The establishment of B. dendrobatidis free, stable, amphibian captive breeding colonies is one of the emergency measures that is being taken to save threatened amphibian species from extinction. For this purpose, in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing and the development of efficient and safe treatment protocols are required. In this study, we evaluated the use of amphotericin B and voriconazole to treat chytridiomycosis in amphibians. The concentration at which the growth of five tested B. dendrobatidis strains was inhibited was 0.8 µg/ml for amphotericin B and 0.0125 µg/ml for voriconazole. To completely eliminate a mixture of sporangia and zoospores of strain IA042 required 48 h of exposure to 8 µg/ml of amphotericin B or 10 days to 1.25 µg/ml of voriconazole. Zoospores were killed within 0.5 h by 0.8 µg/ml of amphotericin B, but even after 24 h exposure to 1.25 µg/ml of voriconazole they remained viable. Amphotericin B was acutely toxic for Alytes muletensis tadpoles at 8 µg/ml, whereas toxic side effects were not noticed during a seven-day exposure to voriconazole at concentrations as high as 12.5 µg/ml. The voriconazole concentrations remained stable in water during this exposure period. On the basis of this data, experimentally inoculated postmetamorphic Alytes cisternasii were sprayed once daily for 7 days with a 1.25 µg/ml solution of voriconazole in water which eliminated the B. dendrobatidis infection from all treated animals.

While several experimental disease mitigation strategies are currently being tested, no proven implementable strategy exists to combat chytridiomycosis in the field. A plausible conservation strategy is the use of probiotic anti-. Bd bacteria to combat chytridiomycosis (bioaugmentation). In this study, we examined the use of soil bioaugmentation in mitigation of chytridiomycosis in a laboratory experiment. Specifically, we sought to determine if the anti-. Bd bacterial species Janthinobacterium lividum could be successfully introduced into natural soil, if the introduced bacteria could then be transmitted to the skin of the amphibian species Plethodon cinereus, and if the environmental transmission of J. lividum could reduce Bd infection on P. cinereus.

In May 2008, Parks Canada installed four amphibian tunnels under this road. We installed drift fences to direct salamanders toward tunnel entrances and monitored tunnel use with pitfall traps in 2008 and 2009. We used logistic regressions and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to determine if probability of tunnel use differed among individual salamanders. Salamander road mortality decreased from 10 of the population to <2 following installation of tunnels and fences. In 2009, 104 salamanders were documented using tunnels. Salamanders were 20 times more likely to use tunnels when traveling to the breeding site than when leaving the site. Distance from tunnel entrances, sex, and body size did not have significant effects on tunnel use by salamanders. Although salamander movement was positively correlated with occurrence of precipitation, this relationship was much stronger when salamanders were leaving the breeding site. Variation in use between the four tunnels was positively correlated with soil moisture of surrounding habitat. Continued monitoring will be needed to determine if tunnel use by Long-toed Salamanders increases through time, and if decreased road mortality translates into population gains. © 2012 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.","10.1643/CE-10-128","CE","CE_5023",219,0.198467442395478,0.0493505285962104,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
5035,2012,"Effects of short-rotation controlled burning on amphibians and reptiles in pine woodlands","Forest Ecology and Management","Fire is being used increasingly as a forest management tool throughout North America, but its effects on reptiles and amphibians in many ecosystems are unclear. Open woodlands with understories dominated by herbaceous vegetation benefit many wildlife species, but maintaining these woodlands requires frequent burning. Although many studies have compared herpetofaunal responses in burned forests to unburned forests, fewer studies have examined changes in the herpetofaunal community during the interval between short-rotation prescribed burns. We examined changes in habitat and relative abundance of reptiles and amphibians each year within a 3-year burn cycle in nine restored pine woodlands of western Arkansas, USA. Overall numbers of reptiles did not change among the three burn years; however, capture rates for one snake species (southern black racer [. Coluber constrictor priapus]) and three lizards differed among the three post-burn years. Overall capture rate for anurans and all amphibians combined was greatest the first year after burning, mostly because captures of dwarf American toads (Bufo americanus charlessmithi) were substantially greater in stands the first year after burning. Salamander captures were infrequent. Capture rates of most reptile and amphibian species declined over the 3-year sampling period. Only minor changes in capture rate occurred among the 36 species we evaluated during the intervening years between frequent burns. Capture rates for only two species were lower the first year after fire. Although not all herpetofaunal species benefited from frequent fire, most species appeared to tolerate the frequent burning necessary for maintaining open pine woodlands in the Ouachita Mountains. © 2012.","10.1016/j.foreco.2012.02.004","CE","CE_5035",250,0.205422040640079,-0.0623839066174064,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
5045,2012,"The role of forest harvesting and subsequent vegetative regrowth in determining patterns of amphibian habitat use","Forest Ecology and Management","Conservation of forest-dependent amphibians is dependent on finding a balance between timber management and species' habitat requirements. To examine the effect of short-term vegetative regrowth post-harvesting on amphibian habitat use, we studied the response of eight species (four forest specialists and four habitat generalists) to four forestry treatments (partial harvest, clearcut with coarse woody debris [CWD] removed, clearcut with CWD retained, and uncut control) over a 6-year period, using replicated experimental treatments in Maine, USA. Forest amphibians showed a strong negative response to clearcutting through the duration of the study, regardless of the presence of CWD, but only during the post-breeding season (i.e., summer). The spring breeding migrations of wood frogs and spotted salamanders to experimental pools were not affected by the forestry treatments. The use of partial cut treatments by forest amphibians differed between animals emerging from experimental pools (i.e., juvenile wood frogs and spotted salamanders), and animals originating from outside the experimental arrays (i.e., adults of all forest species, juvenile wood frogs and spotted salamanders). Animals emerging from our experimental pools showed no difference in the use of control and partial cut treatments, while all the other animals preferred control plots. In addition, we found a modest increase in the use of clearcuts over the 6. years following harvesting by juvenile wood frogs from experimental pools (from an 8-fold difference between forest and clearcut treatments in the first year post-clearcutting to a 3-fold difference during years 3-5). However, this increase was not significantly associated with vegetation regrowth. Forest specialists declined in abundance in all treatments beginning 2-3. years post-disturbance. Despite high yearly fluctuations in abundance, there was a shift in relative abundance towards habitat generalist species, most notably green frog juveniles. Most habitat generalist species were not affected by clearcutting or vegetative regrowth; however, we observed a lower use of clearcut treatments by green frogs starting 3. years post-harvesting, perhaps due to an increase in habitat resistance to movements associated with vegetative regrowth. These general patterns of habitat use were overridden at the local scale by site-specific variation in the use of forestry treatments, most evident in emigrating juvenile wood frogs. From a management standpoint, implementing broad silvicultural prescriptions could be a viable strategy in extensively forested landscapes, but local variation in habitat use has to be acknowledged when managers focus on a limited area. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.foreco.2012.01.027","CE","CE_5045",397,0.281944536196359,0.176847184810675,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

The CHA contains several features that ensure quality of submitted data, while allowing registered users to keep a personal database, and to employ a variety of data visualization tools such as species distribution maps, charts, tables, photos, and other information on North and South Carolina's amphibians and reptiles. From 1 March 2007 to 22 September 2009, the CHA totaled 698 registered users and received 15,626 amphibian and reptile occurrence records. Specifically, distribution data for 32 frogs, 51 salamanders, 38 snakes, 12 lizards, 16 turtles, and the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) were obtained, with most commonly reported group being snakes (5,349 records). Additionally, several records of amphibians and reptiles considered priority species by North and South Carolina were contributed to the CHA.

Public green spaces, such as golf courses and parks, could serve as safe havens to curb the effects of habitat loss if managed in ways to bolster local amphibian communities. We reared larval Blanchard's cricket frogs (Acris blanchardi) and green frogs (Rana clamitans) in golf course ponds with and without 1 m terrestrial buffer zones, and released marked cricket frog metamorphs at the golf course ponds they were reared in. Larval survival of both species was affected by the presence of a buffer zone, with increased survival for cricket frogs and decreased survival for green frogs when reared in ponds with buffer zones. No marked cricket frog juveniles were recovered at any golf course pond in the following year, suggesting that most animals died or migrated. In a separate study, we released cricket frogs in a terrestrial pen and allowed them to choose between mown and unmown grass. Cricket frogs had a greater probability of using unmown versus mown grass.

Although the disappearance of lentic habitats in other regions of the world has been ameliorated by the creation and restoration of wetlands, these tactics remain untested in Mediterranean wetlands. To evaluate the amphibian colonization dynamics of artificial MTPs in the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, we monitored two artificial MTPs (one in a high-diversity area and the other in a low-diversity area) over 2 years. We selected reference wetlands at each area, and amphibian communities of man-made MTPs were compared to those of reference wetlands. We found that, beginning in the first year, artificial MTPs were a valuable habitat for regional amphibian fauna. Posteriorly, we focused on the reproductive success of the natterjack toad, Bufo calamita. Using a drift fence equipped with pit-fall traps, we measured the abundance of both reproductive adults entering the pond and post-metamorphic individuals exiting the pond. Using mark-recapture methods, we analyzed the time and energy costs associated with reproduction in the artificial MTPs. We observed a highly variable colonization dynamics between sites, between hydroperiods, and within hydroperiods, and these dynamics often depended on meteorological factors.

The ecological impacts of herbaceous riparian buffers on the channelized agricultural headwater streams that are common throughout the midwestern United States have not been evaluated. We sampled riparian habitat, geomorphology, instream habitat, water chemistry, fishes, and amphibians for 4 years from three channelized agricultural headwater streams without herbaceous riparian buffers and three channelized streams with herbaceous riparian buffers in central Ohio. Only seven of 55 response variables exhibited differences between buffer types. Riparian widths were greater in channelized headwater streams with herbaceous riparian buffers than streams without herbaceous riparian buffers. Percent insectivores and minnows were greater in channelized streams without herbaceous riparian buffers than streams with herbaceous riparian buffers. Percent clay, turbidity, specific conductance, and pH differed between buffer types only during one sampling period. No differences in geomorphology and amphibian communities occurred between buffer types. Our results suggest channelized agricultural headwater streams with and without herbaceous riparian buffers are similar physically, chemically, and biologically. Installation of herbaceous riparian buffers alone adjacent to channelized agricultural headwater streams in central Ohio and other parts of the midwestern United States may only provide limited environmental benefits for these stream ecosystems in the first 4-6 years after establishment.

Since its discovery, research has been focused on developing various methods of mitigating the impact of chytridiomycosis on amphibian hosts but little attention has been given to the role of antifungal agents that could be added to the host's environment. Sodium chloride is a known antifungal agent used routinely in the aquaculture industry and this study investigates its potential for use as a disease management tool in amphibian conservation. The effect of 0-5 ppt NaCl on the growth, motility and survival of the chytrid fungus when grown in culture media and its effect on the growth, infection load and survivorship of infected Peron's tree frogs (Litoria peronii) in captivity, was investigated. The results reveal that these concentrations do not negatively affect the survival of the host or the pathogen. However, concentrations greater than 3 ppt significantly reduced the growth and motility of the chytrid fungus compared to 0 ppt. Concentrations of 1-4 ppt NaCl were also associated with significantly lower host infection loads while infected hosts exposed to 3 and 4 ppt NaCl were found to have significantly higher survival rates. These results support the potential for NaCl to be used as an environmentally distributed antifungal agent for the prevention of chytridiomycosis in susceptible amphibian hosts. However, further research is required to identify any negative effects of salt exposure on both target and non-target organisms prior to implementation. © 2012 Stockwell et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0036942","CE","CE_5104",256,0.225967011828533,-0.0575643912591572,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
5112,2012,"Meta-analysis of the effects of canopy removal on terrestrial salamander populations in North America","Biological Conservation","Terrestrial salamander abundance in North American forests is closely associated with forest characteristics, and salamander populations typically decline following timber removal. However, salamander responses to timber harvest vary considerably from one study to the next - some studies have shown limited or no effects whereas others have found harvest-related declines of up to 95%. To estimate overall effect sizes of timber harvest on salamander populations and to examine factors that contribute to variation in salamander responses to harvest, we carried out a meta-analysis of published studies of the effects of timber harvesting on terrestrial salamander abundance. Based on 108 salamander species/treatment combinations from 24 studies, we found mean harvest-related declines ranged from 29% (95% CI = -2% to 51%) for long-term responses to partial canopy removal to 62% (95% CI = 29% to 80%) for short-term responses to clearcutting. Multivariate mixed models suggested that clearcutting had a modestly greater impact on salamander populations than partial harvest and that decreases following harvest were more pronounced at sites with warmer summer high temperatures. In addition, active sampling of salamanders (e.g., surface counts) led to greater apparent effects of timber harvest than passive sampling (e.g., cover boards or pitfall traps), suggesting that sampling methodology influenced the perceived effects of harvest. In the studies evaluated, salamander numbers almost always declined following timber removal, but salamanders were never extirpated and populations typically increased as forests regenerated. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2012.03.030","CE","CE_5112",227,0.290411829126639,0.116790993378508,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

However, empirical data on how road features facilitate or impede bat movements are scarce and essential for planning mitigation measures. We investigated bat movements across a motorway where it intersects with potential bat commuting routes along prominent linear landscape elements (treelines along hedgerows, minor roads, and rivers). Bat activity was recorded acoustically at four types of potential crossing routes; two under-motorway routes (river bridges and underpasses) and two over-motorway routes (overbridges and severed treelines), while simultaneously recording activity in the adjacent habitat. Bat activity above and below motorway structures and the timing of crossing flights with respect to motorway vehicles were also recorded. All bat species recorded in the adjacent landscape crossed the motorway. Bats used under-motorway routes, particularly river bridges, more than over-motorway routes. Contrary to expectations, many species flew across motorway gaps in treelines despite the lack of a guiding structure, including clutter-adapted species (Myotis spp., Plecotus auritus). Furthermore, bat passes were also recorded for the more collision-prone flight route at crossing structures (2% and 6.4% recorded above motorway level at river bridges and underpasses respectively, and 50% recorded on the underside of overbridges). In a subset of 10 nights of motorway-edge recordings, 18.3% of bat passes coincided with, and 17.1% were within 1-5. s of, passing vehicles.

5376,2012,"Clutter-adaptation of bat species predicts their use of under-motorway passageways of contrasting sizes - a natural experiment","Journal of Zoology","Bat populations may be vulnerable to the barrier impacts of roads, including habitat restriction and traffic mortality. Under-road passageways may reduce these impacts, but little is known about the ecological factors influencing their use by bats. The study area provided a natural experimental design, in that adjacent under-motorway passageways had contrasting dimensions (two long, narrow drainage pipes within <1km of a large underpass for a minor road), and local bat species had contrasting functional and morphological adaptations. We predicted that inter-species differences in flight capability and sensory perception would influence bat use of passageways. All-night acoustic recordings of bat activity inside passageways (52 nights) indicated clear guild-specific responses to passageway dimensions. Only Rhinolophus hipposideros, Myotis nattereri and Plecotus auritus flew through the narrow drainage pipes. These species are adapted for flight and foraging in cluttered airspace, in terms of wing morphology and echolocation signal design. Edge-space species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus) were highly active in the area but never flew through the narrow pipes. All species, except the open-adapted Nyctalus leisleri, flew through the large underpass. Simultaneous recordings made above and below this underpass (16 nights) also indicated that species' tendency to cross over, rather than under, the structure was inversely related to the degree of clutter-adaptation. If motorways are built through bat habitat, trade-offs between optimal mitigation of impacts on protected bats and cost/engineering practicality are inevitable. Large underpasses are advisable where possible as they accommodate a wider range of species, and bats are less likely to fly over them. However, their construction is costly and is dependent on landscape topology. If the target species for mitigation are clutter-adapted bats, our findings indicate that incorporation of a greater number of suitably located small tunnels into new roads may facilitate safe passage more effectively than fewer large underpasses. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00894.x","CE","CE_5376",312,0.210602132957622,0.099648852644265,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
5377,2012,"The effects of prescribed fire on bat communities in the longleaf pine sandhills ecosystem","Journal of Mammalogy","The historical exclusion of fire from the longleaf pine - wiregrass (sandhills) ecosystem has resulted in a tremendous net loss of this important habitat. Prescribed fire is recognized as an essential tool for the maintenance of natural successional dynamics in this system, and its positive effects on native tree, shrub, and ground-layer plant communities are well documented. However, little is known about the influence of fire periodicity on many of the wildlife species occupying these forests. Our goal was to determine the relative degree to which a forest's structural characteristics and insect abundance and biomass influence the activity of different ecomorphological guilds of insectivorous bats and whether either of these factors was influenced by the periodicity of prescribed fire. We conducted a 2-year echolocation-monitoring study of bats in sandhills forests experiencing 3 categories of fire periodicity: 1 - 2 years, 3 - 5 years, and >8 years. We found significant differences in tree, shrub, and ground-layer characteristics among these burn-frequency categories, but few differences in abundance or biomass of most orders of nocturnal insects. However, the biomass of Lepidoptera was greatest at sites with the longest time between burns and was positively associated with fire-dependent deciduous tree and shrub densities. Bat activity below the canopy was significantly lower in the sites with >8-year burn frequencies than in either of the other treatments and was positively associated with height of canopy closure (a fire-dependent variable). Species-specific activity patterns confirmed ecomorphological predictions. Small-bodied species with low wing loadings and aspect ratios replaced larger, less-maneuverable species below the canopy at sites with >8-year burn frequencies. We provide support for the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of a habitat have primacy over prey availability in habitat choice by large and fast-flying species of bats. We suggest that frequency of fire is an important indirect determinant in structuring the communities of bats that forage in forests. © 2012 American Society of Mammalogists.","10.1644/11-mamm-a-169.1","CE","CE_5377",316,0.230824785858105,0.149358357566975,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1
5383,2012,"Do bat gantries and underpasses help bats cross roads safely?","PLoS ONE","Major roads can reduce bat abundance and diversity over considerable distances. To mitigate against these effects and comply with environmental law, many European countries install bridges, gantries or underpasses to make roads permeable and safer to cross. However, through lack of appropriate monitoring, there is little evidence to support their effectiveness. Three underpasses and four bat gantries were investigated in northern England. Echolocation call recordings and observations were used to determine the number of bats using underpasses in preference to crossing the road above, and the height at which bats crossed. At gantries, proximity to the gantry and height of crossing bats were measured. Data were compared to those from adjacent, severed commuting routes that had no crossing structure. At one underpass 96% of bats flew through it in preference to crossing the road. This underpass was located on a pre-construction commuting route that allowed bats to pass without changing flight height or direction. At two underpasses attempts to divert bats from their original commuting routes were unsuccessful and bats crossed the road at the height of passing vehicles. Underpasses have the potential to allow bats to cross roads safely if built on pre-construction commuting routes. Bat gantries were ineffective and used by a very small proportion of bats, even up to nine years after construction. Most bats near gantries crossed roads along severed, pre-construction commuting routes at heights that put them in the path of vehicles. Crossing height was strongly correlated with verge height, suggesting that elevated verges may have some value in mitigation, but increased flight height may be at the cost of reduced permeability. Green bridges should be explored as an alternative form of mitigation. Robust monitoring is essential to assess objectively the case for mitigation and to ensure effective mitigation. © 2012 Berthinussen, Altringham.","10.1371/journal.pone.0038775","CE","CE_5383",298,0.235291121533712,0.136059905086473,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced in many countries as an attempt to counteract the negative effects of intensive agriculture by providing financial incentives for farmers to adopt environmentally-sensitive agricultural practices. We surveyed 18 pairs of AES and conventionally-managed farms in central Scotland (United Kingdom) to evaluate the effects of specific AES management prescriptions (field margins, hedgerows, species-rich grasslands and water margins) on foraging bats and nocturnal insects. In addition, we assessed the importance of habitat in the wider landscape at several spatial scales on foraging bats and their insect prey. Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus were the most commonly recorded species, accounting for 98% of total bat activity levels. Overall levels of bat activity and the abundance of their insect prey (mainly Diptera and Trichoptera) were lower (by 40-50%) on farms participating in AES than on non-participating farms. Differences in insect abundance were also significant when we compared specific AES management prescriptions with equivalent conventionally-managed features. The surrounding landscape influenced bat activity; fragmentation metrics related to woodland configuration were the most important landscape characteristics influencing bat activity levels. However, the two Pipistrelle species responded differently to the surrounding landscape, P. pipistrellus being strongly influenced by the landscape at large scales (e.g. within 2. km of the monitoring site) and P. pygmaeus being most influenced by the landscape at smaller scales (within 500. m of the monitoring site). Insect abundance was positively affected by the percentage cover of semi-natural environment within 500. m of trapping sites. We suggest that the implementation of the four common AES management prescriptions assessed in this study does not benefit Pipistrelle bats nor other bat species foraging on similar prey. Such species may respond more positively to a landscape-scale management approach focused mainly on the creation and management of woodland. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2011.05.015","CE","CE_5398",309,0.212692415985157,0.170365068228346,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

We recorded 15 species of bats; the highest numbers recorded in a single survey were 54,600 hibernating and 11,000 breeding/nursing. Different parts of the cave system are used by bats to various degrees according to season. To protect the bats and the cave system the visitor schedule took into consideration the differences in seasonal use of the caves by bats. There was a significant increase in the total number of bats recorded in the cave system after opening for tourism, possibly because the gating of two entrances helped to control visitation. The results of our surveys of this cave system show that gating of entrances and visits by tourists are not necessarily incompatible with the use of caves by bats for both hibernating and nursing. Understanding how the three caves are used seasonally by the bat community, and for what purposes (hibernation vs nursing), was critical for the establishment of an appropriate management plan for tourism. © 2012 Fauna & Flora Internationa.","10.1017/S0030605310001493","CE","CE_5425",224,0.21301811419743,0.011723870798077,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
5428,2012,"Do green roofs provide habitat for bats in urban areas?","Acta Chiropterologica","Green roofs, (roofs that are deliberately vegetated), are a technology that seeks to lessen the impacts of urbanisation on people and wildlife. This study investigates their value for UK bat species within the context of the built environment. Green roofs were categorised as 'sedum' or 'biodiverse' according to their dominant vegetation type. Bat activity was monitored over 13 biodiverse, nine sedum and 17 conventional un-vegetated roofs located within the Greater London area for seven nights using Anabat SD1 detectors. Influence of roof type and environmental variables on bat activity were evaluated using generalised linear models. Pipistrellus pipistrellus were most frequently recorded followed by Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Nyctalus/Eptesicus and Pipistrellus nathusii. The mean number of call sequences per night was 5.2. Feeding events accounted for 16% (217) of call sequences. Bat activity was significantly higher over biodiverse roofs compared to conventional roofs. A greater extent of suitable habitat within the surrounding area had a positive influence on bat activity but numbers of call sequences and feeding events were significantly higher over biodiverse roofs compared to conventional roofs when suitable habitat within a 100 metre radius of the roof was below 33% cover. Other factors affecting bat activity included roof height (negative influence with increased height) and the month of survey. No significant differences were found between sedum and conventional roofs. The findings suggest that biodiverse roofs offer enhanced habitat for bats within the context of urbanised environments. Further studies are needed to predict more accurately their value as a bat conservation measure. © Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.","10.3161/150811012x661774","CE","CE_5428",251,0.19273403131877,0.107346369389269,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
5446,2012,"Constructed wetlands support bats in agricultural landscapes","Basic and Applied Ecology","Bats are known to use aquatic habitats as foraging habitats. Agricultural intensification is perceived to be a main reason for the loss of wetlands. However, artificial wetland creation (i.e. the construction of retention-ponds) in the agricultural landscape aiming at water or nutrient retention has recently gained importance. We evaluated to what extent bats use these artificial wetlands as foraging habitats in an agricultural landscape.Bat activity and prey density were compared in matched pairs at retention-ponds and neighbouring vineyard sites using stationary bat-detectors and sticky-traps, respectively. To examine if bat activity is related to the number of bat individuals, a thermal infrared imaging camera was used. . Pipistrellus pipistrellus, the dominant species, served as an example to assess habitat selection between retention-ponds and vineyards. This was performed by relating foraging activity to the available area available within the potential home-range.Total bat activity and nocturnal prey density were significantly higher above the retention-ponds than above vineyards. High differences of activity levels between the ponds and the respective vineyard sites were found for . Pipistrellus spp. (. P. pipistrellus and . P. nathusii) and . Myotis spp. (. M. daubentonii and . M. mystacinus), being about 180 times and 50 times higher above the retention-ponds, respectively. A significant correlation was found between recorded bat activity and the maximum number of bat individuals observed with a thermal infrared imaging camera. When relating foraging activity to habitat availability within the assumed home-range of . P. pipistrellus, retention-ponds had on average a higher importance as a foraging habitat than the complete vineyard area although they covered less than 0.1% of its area.This study indicates that artificial wetlands such as retention-ponds provide foraging habitats for bats. Therefore, creation of wetlands in intensively used agricultural landscapes benefits bats. © 2012 Gesellschaft für ökologie.","10.1016/j.baae.2012.02.001","CE","CE_5446",297,0.150800978139966,0.174236068078784,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Impacts of LED lighting on bats","Global Change Biology","Artificial lighting is a key biodiversity threat and produces 1900 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions globally, more than three times that produced by aviation. The need to meet climate change targets has led to a global increase in energy-efficient light sources such as high-brightness light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Despite the energetic benefits of LEDs, their ecological impacts have not been tested. Using an experimental approach, we show that LED street lights caused a reduction in activity of slow-flying bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros and Myotis spp.). Both R. hipposideros and Myotis spp. activities were significantly reduced even during low light levels of 3.6 lux. There was no effect of LED lighting on the relatively fast-flying Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Nyctalus/Eptesicus spp. We provide the first evidence of the effects of LED lights on bats. Despite having considerable energy-saving benefits, LED lights can potentially fragment commuting routes for bats with associated negative conservation consequences. Our results add to the growing evidence of negative impacts of lighting on a wide range of taxa. We highlight the complexities involved in simultaneously meeting targets for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. New lighting strategies should integrate climate change targets with the cultural, social and ecological impacts of emerging lighting technologies. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02705.x","CE","CE_5447",214,0.227599969781915,0.164853089652196,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
5459,2011,"Ensemble composition and activity levels of insectivorous bats in response to management intensification in coffee agroforestry systems","PLoS ONE","Shade coffee plantations have received attention for their role in biodiversity conservation. Bats are among the most diverse mammalian taxa in these systems; however, previous studies of bats in coffee plantations have focused on the largely herbivorous leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae). In contrast, we have virtually no information on how ensembles of aerial insectivorous bats - nearly half the Neotropical bat species - change in response to habitat modification. To evaluate the effects of agroecosystem management on insectivorous bats, we studied their diversity and activity in southern Chiapas, Mexico, a landscape dominated by coffee agroforestry. We used acoustic monitoring and live captures to characterize the insectivorous bat ensemble in forest fragments and coffee plantations differing in the structural and taxonomic complexity of shade trees. We captured bats of 12 non-phyllostomid species; acoustic monitoring revealed the presence of at least 12 more species of aerial insectivores. Richness of forest bats was the same across all land-use types; in contrast, species richness of open-space bats increased in low shade, intensively managed coffee plantations. Conversely, only forest bats demonstrated significant differences in ensemble structure (as measured by similarity indices) across land-use types. Both overall activity and feeding activity of forest bats declined significantly with increasing management intensity, while the overall activity, but not feeding activity, of open-space bats increased. We conclude that diverse shade coffee plantations in our study area serve as valuable foraging and commuting habitat for aerial insectivorous bats, and several species also commute through or forage in low shade coffee monocultures. © 2011 Williams-Guillén, Perfecto.","10.1371/journal.pone.0016502","CE","CE_5459",255,0.177732877255717,0.144987113333636,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

5652,2012,"Differential responses of plants, reptiles and birds to grazing management, fertilizer and tree clearing","Austral Ecology","The relative effects of tree clearing, increased livestock densities and nutrient enrichment have rarely been compared across markedly different organism types, but negative effects are generally predicted. In contrast, adoption of rotational grazing is thought to benefit biodiversity in pastures but there are few supporting data. We examined the response of native plants, birds and reptiles to livestock management in south-eastern Australia. We selected 12 pairs of rotationally and continuously grazed farms. Two 1-ha plots were established in native pastures on each farm, one cleared and the second still retaining woodland tree cover. Stocking rates, fertilizer histories and landscape tree cover varied among farms. The abundance and richness of all taxa was lower in cleared pastures. The less mobile organisms (reptiles and plants) were positively correlated with tree cover at landscape scales, but only when trees were present at the plot scale. This pattern was driven by a few observations in landscapes with approximately 50% tree canopy cover. Neither bird abundance nor richness was correlated with stocking rates or nutrient enrichment, but plant richness responded negatively to both. The response of reptiles varied, declining with nutrient enrichment but positively correlated with livestock densities. These responses may be partly interpreted within the context of prior filtering of species pools through long-term grazing pressure. No taxa responded positively to rotational grazing management. We predict that reductions in livestock density and soil nutrients will directly benefit plants and less so reptiles, but not birds. Indirect benefits are predicted for birds and reptiles if management increases persistence of trees within paddocks. Although some forms of rotational grazing can increase woodland tree recruitment, rotational grazing in itself is unlikely to enhance diversity. © 2012 The Authors.

The boxes were monitored for signs of use once a year. A proportion of the boxes was occupied by martens every year and the boxes were used by breeding females to raise their young. The den boxes can be implemented as a habitat enhancement and conservation tool, particularly in commercial forests, and used to monitor marten populations and breeding success.

To investigate whether hair eating could be reduced through changes in diet, a 2-part study was conducted with a group of baboons (Papio hamadryas sp.). The 1st part involved changing to a twice-daily feeding routine, thus providing prolonged access to an appropriate food source. The 2nd part involved scattering a grain mix to encourage more foraging while maintaining a once-daily feeding routine. Changing the feeding routine unexpectedly resulted in a significant increase in hair manipulation and ingestion. Providing additional grain did not significantly decrease hair manipulation and ingestion, but several individuals did show a reduction in these behaviors. Prolonged access to biscuits and the provision of a grain mix may have failed to satisfy the urge to forage because little effort was needed for their collection prior to consumption. Although the current study failed to significantly decrease hair eating, it provides valuable insight into further avenues of research on the behavior.","10.1080/10888705.2014.980888","CE","CE_5897",172,0.332082783430546,0.0495010569323071,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

In ""Yard-toss,"" forage was thrown by hand over one third of the yard. In ""Set-up,"" forage and browse were hand-scattered throughout the yard. ""Set-up Enriched"" was similar with the addition of either a hay- and forage-filled feeder or forage-filled boomer ball(s) suspended from a climbing structure. Each treatment was presented on 5 d. Behavior was recorded for 30min before (baseline) and 30min after the start of each treatment. All treatments led to more foraging and less inactivity compared with baseline (P80.05), but Yard-toss was the least effective, likely because resources were clumped and monopolized by dominant animals. In Set-up Enriched, dominant animals had the greatest increase in foraging (P=0.03), partly because they generally monopolized the suspended items, but this allowed others to forage at ground level. This separation of the animals likely explains why Set-Up Enriched led to more foraging than all other treatments (P80.05).

Despite the growing availability of such information an over-reliance on commercially available primate foods and fruit continues in many captive establishments. Wild slender lorises are almost exclusively insectivorous, yet captive conspecifics are fed a primarily frugivorous diet that is likely to contribute to behavioral and health problems. We investigated the effect of naturalizing diet in the Northern Ceylon grey slender loris (Loris lydekkerianus nordicus) by providing live insect prey to a captive group of five individuals. We calculated activity budgets in accordance with six established categories and recorded positional behaviors. We collected data over 30 hours for each of three conditions: pre-enrichment, enrichment, post-enrichment. We hypothesized that increased opportunity for the display of natural behaviors would be stimulated by the dietary enrichment of live insects and made the following predictions; 1) Percentage time spent foraging would increase and time spent inactive would decrease; 2) behavioral repertoires would increase; 3) foraging patterns would be more constant over time with reduced feeding-time peaks. We analyzed time budget and behavioral changes using Friedman tests. We found significant changes in activity budgets with inactivity reduced and foraging levels increased to levels seen in wild slender lorises. We found a significant increase in postures used in foraging and a wider behavioral repertoire. We discuss the benefits of providing free-ranging live food in relation to enhancing the temporal-spatial distribution of food acquisition, satisfying nutritional requirements, balancing energy intake, and expenditure, expanding sensory stimulation, and promoting behavioral competence.

Determining this is important for assessing progress toward restoration goals and, more generally, for gaining insight into ecosystem functioning and dynamics. We studied this question as it relates to mid- to large-sized terrestrial fauna in restored riparian habitats at the Sacramento River National Wildlife Refuge, in northern California. We used camera traps to document use of 16 riparian corridor sites of varying restoration age. Comparisons of species richness (diversity) and visitation frequency (activity) were made across different-aged sites. We found that predator diversity and activity levels tended to be higher in restored forests than in remnant forests, and that they tended to be highest in young restored forests. This trend persisted when data from variable sampling periods were pooled, although significant differences occurred more often in wet and cold sampling periods. The trend did not always hold for the animal community at large (consisting of both predator and non-predator species). We conclude that restoration age affects predator diversity and activity levels in restored and remnant floodplain forests, and that predator communities can establish soon after restoration. Our results suggest that restoring natural river processes that promote habitat regeneration may benefit mid- to large-sized terrestrial predators that appear to mostly use early successional habitat.","10.1111/rec.12286","CE","CE_6116",224,0.306726018178288,0.196920709081953,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
6228,2012,"Effects of grazing and invasive grasses on desert vertebrates in California","Journal of Wildlife Management","Much of California's San Joaquin Valley is a desert and, like portions of other North American deserts, is experiencing an ecological shift from being dominated by ephemeral native forbs, with widely spaced shrubs, to fire-prone non-native annual grasses. Small terrestrial vertebrates, many of which are adapted to open desert habitats, are declining. One hypothesis is that the invasive plants contribute to the decline by altering vegetative structure. Although cattle may have originally been a factor in the establishment of these non-native plants, their grazing may benefit the terrestrial vertebrates by maintaining an open structure, especially during average or wet winters when the exotic grasses grow especially dense. We experimentally tested the effect of cattle grazing on invasive plants and a community of small vertebrates at a site in the southwestern San Joaquin Desert. We established and monitored 4 treatment (grazed) and 4 control (ungrazed) plots from 1997 to 2006, and assessed the abundances of blunt-nosed leopard lizards (Gambelia sila), giant kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ingens), short-nosed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys nitratoides nitratoides), and San Joaquin antelope squirrels (Ammospermophilus nelsoni), all of which are listed as threatened or endangered by state or federal agencies. We also recorded abundances of the non-protected western whiptail lizards (Aspidoscelis tigris), side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana), San Joaquin pocket mice (Perognathus inornatus inornatus), and Heermann's kangaroo rats (Dipdomys heermanni). Based on repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a 0.05 alpha level, only Heermann's kangaroo rats showed a treatment effect; they were more abundant on the control plots. However, this effect could be accounted for by the natural re-establishment of saltbush (Atriplex spp.) on part of the study site. Saltbush return also favored western whiptail lizards and San Joaquin antelope squirrels. A regression analysis indicated that populations of blunt-nosed leopard lizard and giant kangaroo rat increased significantly faster in grazed plots than the ungrazed controls, and abundances of 6 of 8 species were negatively correlated with increased residual dry matter. With relaxed alpha values to decrease Type II error, populations of blunt-nosed leopard lizards (500% greater), San Joaquin antelope squirrels (85% greater), and short-nosed kangaroo rats (73% greater) increased significantly on grazed plots over the course of the study compared to ungrazed plots. We did not find grazing to negatively affect abundance of any species we studied. When herbaceous cover is low during years of below average rainfall in deserts and other arid areas, grazing may not be necessary to maintain populations of small vertebrates. However, if cattle grazing is closely monitored in space and time to minimize adverse effects on the habitat, it could be an effective tool to control dense stands of non-native grasses and benefit native wildlife. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.316","CE","CE_6228",446,0.211758667039213,0.0140530636908184,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Primate researchers have to date given more attention to evaluating techniques for monitoring primates in natural habitats compared to populations that occur in villages or urban areas. We conducted censuses to estimate the abundance and density of two sacred, village-dwelling populations (Lagwa and Akpugoeze) of Sclater's monkey (Cercopithecus sclateri), a threatened species endemic to southeastern Nigeria, and compared these data to previous census results. We recorded population increases in both sites: a 66% increase over 41/2 years in Lagwa (from 124 to 206 individuals) at an annual rate of 10.2%, and a 29% increase over 4 years in Akpugoeze (from 193 to 249 individuals) at an annual rate of 5.7%. Mean group size also increased in both sites. Density in Lagwa was 24.2individuals/km2, and density in a core survey area of Akpugoeze was 36-38individuals/km2. Our results may have been affected by monkey ranging and grouping patterns and improved detectability due to our revised census technique, which included secondary observers. With further work on methodology for censusing populations that occur in human-settled environments, techniques can be refined and customized to individual sites for more accurate estimates. Our investigation of Sclater's monkey in Lagwa and Akpugoeze, two sites critical for conservation of the species, indicated that both of these populations have increased, and neither faces immediate risk of extirpation. Such population growth, while encouraging, will likely exacerbate human-monkey conflict and thus should be understood in terms of potential socioeconomic impacts. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","10.1002/ajp.22234","CE","CE_6343",262,0.196661035532031,0.238882174783743,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
6350,2012,"Evaluating the effectiveness of humanâorangutan conflict mitigation strategies in Sumatra","Journal of Applied Ecology","1.Crop raiding by great apes is an emerging conservation issue across their range. It is important because it involves highly threatened species that can cause significant economic damage and be killed in retribution. Yet, to date, no quantitative study has sought to test possible solutions for preventing this form of human-wildlife conflict. 2.From February 2007 to August 2009, we monitored crop-raiding patterns across a Sumatran agroforest landscape to determine background levels of human-orangutan conflict. We also intensively monitored a subset of 50 farms to assess changes in farmer attitudes towards orangutan management; differences between farmer reported and independently enumerated monetary loss from crop raiding; and the effectiveness of mitigation techniques in reducing orangutan crop raiding on 35 treatment farms (25 trialling noise deterrents and 10 trialling tree nets) in comparison with 15 control farms over a pre-trial (12month) and a trial (18month) phase. Five months after the trials had ended, the ongoing use or uptake of the techniques were assessed. 3.Across the wider landscape, background levels of mean daily orangutan crop-raiding incidents per month (±SE) farms did not significantly differ between the pre-trial (9·1±3·7) and trial (7·1±4·3) phases, whilst on the 35 treatment farms it reduced significantly. Furthermore, crop yield increased (+60·8%) on the netted trial trees, but reduced (-27·4%) on the control farm trees. Despite this, there was no subsequent use of this technique, unlike those farmers (40%) who continued using the less-effective noise deterrents. 4.Farmer participation in the project yielded unexpected and positive attitude changes, from preferring orangutan removal (pre-trial) to in situ management with crop protection measures (post-trial). However, project participation may have increased farmer expectations of receiving compensation because the treatment farmers consistently overestimated their crop losses, unlike the control farmers who did not. 5.Synthesis and applications. Whilst human-orangutan conflicts caused substantial losses to local livelihoods, the identification of an effective mitigation method (nets) neither guaranteed its continued use nor uptake.

6358,2011,"Fostering appropriate behavior in rehabilitant orangutans (<i>Pongo pygmaeus</i>)","International Journal of Primatology","Rehabilitation centers in Indonesia and Malaysia accommodate displaced orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus and P. abelii) and aim to facilitate their release into the wild by developing in them the skills that are necessary for survival. Regular forest excursions are provided but their efficacy in improving learning of appropriate behaviors is unknown. We observed 40 rehabilitating orangutans from the Orangutan Care and Quarantine Centre during 3 forest excursions each to determine whether their behavior fostered the development of survival skills. In total, 38% of their time was spent in locomotion, particularly quadrupedal arboreal travel (13%), walking (8%), climbing (7%), and vine-swinging (4%). 26.5% of their time was spent = 5 m from the ground, at heights up to 25 m. Arboreal activities were more common early in the excursions and interaction with caregivers more common later (h 1: 0.3% of time; h 5: 0.9% of time). Individuals of lower body mass were significantly more likely to engage in arboreal movement, locomotion in general, eating of bark and leaves, and social play, and less likely to eat insects. Those that had been at the Centre the longest were less likely to perform arboreal activities and significantly more likely to be found standing and at ground level than those that had been there for a shorter time. During this study, many forest food items were consumed, particularly leaves and fruit, but also invertebrates and bark. Little time was spent in sexual behavior, tool use, nest building, or socially mediated learning, but social play occupied almost 6% of their time. We conclude that regular excursions into the forest are likely to assist in the development of locomotion and feeding skills for survival in rehabilitating orangutans, but special attention is needed to encourage nest building, social activities, and arboreal activity. Heavy individuals and those that have been captive for a long time are least likely to benefit. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","10.1007/s10764-011-9491-1","CE","CE_6358",301,0.491129944593247,0.333594711493743,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
6363,2012,"Evaluating the suitability of planted forests for African forest monkeys: a case study from Kakamega forest, Kenya","American Journal of Primatology","As natural forest cover declines, planted forests have come to occupy an increasing percentage of the earth's surface, yet we know little about their suitability as alternative habitat for wildlife. Although some primate species use planted forests, few studies have compared primate populations in natural and nearby planted forests. From March 2006 to July 2010, we conducted line transect surveys and assessed group sizes and compositions in natural and nearby 60-70 year old mixed indigenous planted forest to determine the densities of diurnal primate species (Colobus guereza, Cercopithecus mitis, C. ascanius) in these two forest types at Isecheno, Kakamega Forest, Kenya. Line transect data were analyzed using the Encounter Rate, Whitesides, and Distance sampling methods, which all provided broadly consistent results. We found that all three diurnal primate species occupy both natural and planted forest at Isecheno. However, group densities of the two Cercopithecus species were 42-46% lower in planted than in natural forest. Colobus guereza achieved comparable group densities in the two forest types, although the species is found in smaller groups, and thus at lower (35%) individual density, in planted than in natural forest. Following a logging episode in the planted forest mid-way through our study, Cercopithecus ascanius group densities fell by 60% while C. mitis and Colobus guereza group densities remained stable over the next two years. Overall, our results suggest that while primate species vary in their response to habitat disturbance, planted forest has the potential to contribute to the conservation of some African monkey species. Even for the relatively flexible taxa in our study, however, 60-70 year old mixed indigenous planted forest failed to support densities comparable to those in nearby natural forest. From the perspective of Kakamega's primates, planted forests may supplement natural forest, but are not an adequate replacement for it. Am. J.

6368,2012,"Assessment of the release of rehabilitated vervet monkeys into the Ntendeka Wilderness Area, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: a case study","Primates","In South Africa, vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops) are frequently persecuted, resulting in large numbers of injured and/or orphaned animals. Rehabilitation centres aim to care for these monkeys and ultimately return them to the wild whenever possible. However, it is unknown whether rehabilitation is successful in its goal of creating wild-living, independent, self-sustaining troops due to limited published research in this area. This study describes the release and subsequent fate of a troop of rehabilitated vervet monkeys over a 6-month period. A troop of 16 monkeys was released into the Ntendeka Wilderness Area, a protected part of Ngome Forest, by the WATCH (Wild Animal Trauma Centre and Haven) rehabilitation centre in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Monitoring data were evaluated with regard to survival, mortality, suitability of the release site, breeding, condition, troop composition, behaviour, group dynamics, ranging patterns and the effectiveness of monitoring tools. The release was considered to be a partial success in that the troop exhibited behaviour, group dynamics and ranging patterns similar to wild conspecifics. However, the survival rate was low and the troop was judged to be non-self-sustaining. The main problems identified were the limited lifetimes of radio collars, which resulted in missing animals and caused monitoring to be cut short, illegal hunting activities, predation and a small troop size with few adults. The authors recommend improvements that may increase success, such as retaining troops in release enclosures for longer periods, releasing a larger troop with more adults that more closely matches wild troop composition, selecting a release site at least 3 km from the nearest human settlement and the use of GPS collars to allow for a longer monitoring period encompassing all seasonal conditions. Furthermore, all primates for release should be medically screened so as to avoid potential negative impacts on wild populations. © 2012 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.",NA,"CE","CE_6368",305,0.289630082897307,0.0264233127198232,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Such programs, which also typically in parallel help foster the protection of the release site, concern a wide range of endangered mammalian species, including our closest living relatives: chimpanzees. In June 2008, the Chimpanzee Conservation Center (CCC), which is located in the High Niger National Park (HNNP) in Guinea, released a group of 12 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) comprised of 6 females and 6 males (8-20 yr old). The selected release site lies 32 km from the sanctuary in the Mafou, a core area of HNNP where wild chimpanzees are also known to occur. The purpose of this release was therefore to reinforce the natural chimpanzee population within the Mafou core area and to promote the protection of the HNNP. Nearly 2 yr postrelease, 9 chimpanzees still remain free-living. Two thirds of the release chimpanzees were equipped with VHF-GPS store-on-board tracking collars. We used data from retrieved collars to explore the release chimpanzees' habitat use, individual day range, and core area use (50% and 80%) during the first year of the release. Males traveled significantly further than females. Although minimum day range did not differ between the sexes or vary seasonally, some release males were active for longer during the day than the females. Males also ranged over larger areas and used a wider network of core areas than the females. Habitat use was similar to that recorded in wild chimpanzees in the HNNP. As of September 2010, 2 males and 3 females form a group at the release site. Two of these females gave birth to healthy offspring respectively 16 and 20 mo postrelease. Another female successfully immigrated into a wild chimpanzee community. We suggest that the success of this chimpanzee release can be attributed to the CCC's lengthy rehabilitation process and the savanna-mosaic habitat of the HNNP. This release demonstrates that under special socioecological circumstances, the release of wild-born adult chimpanzees of both sexes is a viable strategy, which can also function as an effective conservation tool. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","10.1007/s10764-010-9482-7","CE","CE_6372",361,0.207125173069075,0.176550302883423,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Pygmy lorises were monitored until death, recapture, or loss of collar; the longest monitoring period was 73 d. The mean (±SD) distances between consecutive sleeping sites were recorded for 324 consecutive days and averaged 122 ± 108.0 m. Mean distances between sleeping sites for males and females were similar at 110.7 ± 92.6 m for males and 128.8 ± 116.7 m for females, with the greatest distance covered by a female (793 m). Mean height of the sleeping sites was 8.54 ± 4.46 m (n = 60), in trees with a mean diameter at breast height of 75.2 ± 58.4 cm (n = 225). Mean height of the trees where lorises slept was 20.2 ± 9.0 m (n = 230). The pygmy lorises slept mostly in the >8 m band, the area of highest tree connectivity. Of the pygmy lorises studied 38% (5/13) were found dead, 7% (1/13) were returned to captivity due to severe loss of condition and for 23% (3/13) the outcome is unknown due to early collar loss.

6378,2012,"Assessing initial reintroduction success in long-lived primates by quantifying survival, reproduction, and dispersal parameters: western lowland gorillas (<i>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</i>) in Congo and Gabon","International Journal of Primatology","Postrelease monitoring is an important aspect of reintroduction projects, one outcome of which is to allow an assessment of the initial success of the reintroduction, often measured by quantifying survival and reproduction rates. In long-lived species, accurate estimations of demographic parameters are difficult to obtain, and therefore assessment of reintroduction success in such species is challenging. To assess the initial success of a reintroduction program for the long-lived, slow-reproducing, and critically endangered western lowland gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla, we analyzed postrelease monitoring data from 2 reintroduced populations, in the Batéké Plateau region of the Republics of Congo and Gabon, to quantify several demographic parameters, and compared our results with published data on wild gorilla populations. Annual survival rate of the 51 released gorillas was 97. 4%, 9 females gave birth to 11 infants at an annual birth rate of 0. 196 births per adult female, and first-year survival of the infants was 81. 8%. Annual birth rate within the reintroduced populations is not significantly different from that given for wild western gorilla populations, and other demographic parameters fall within the range of published data for wild gorilla populations. Our analysis illustrates that the reintroduction program has been successful in terms of the initial measures of postrelease survival and reproduction, and our quantitative data should facilitate the development of a population model that can predict the probability of population persistence and therefore provide an indication of longer-term reintroduction success. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","10.1007/s10764-011-9563-2","CE","CE_6378",238,0.275705104770226,0.147988026509296,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Here we use meta-analytic techniques to examine data from the resulting education evaluation programs for trends in knowledge acquisition across PASA sanctuaries. Question content strongly impacted the evaluation results of the conservation education program. In addition, effect size and final performance scores were independent of one another and provide different perspectives as to the effectiveness of a conservation education program.

Variation in glucocorticoid levels of the same species between protected and unprotect areas seldom has been measured, and the available evidence suggests that this relationship may depend on species-specific habitat requirements and biology. In the present study we focused on black howler monkeys ( Alouatta pigra), a canopy-dwelling primate species, as a case study to evaluate the physiological consequences of living in unprotected areas, and relate them with intragroup competition and competition with extragroup individuals. From February 2006 to September 2007 we collected 371 fecal samples from 21 adults belonging to five groups (two from protected and three from unprotected areas) in Campeche, Mexico. We recorded agonistic interactions within groups and encounters with other groups (1,200 h of behavioral observations), and determined fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations with radioimmunoassays. We used linear mixed models and Akaike's information criterion to choose the best model explaining variation in FGM concentrations between protected and unprotected areas calculated from five categorical variables: habitat type (protected vs. unprotected), participation in agonistic interactions, intergroup encounters, sex and female reproductive state, and season. The best model included habitat type, the interaction between habitat type and agonism, and the interaction between habitat type and season. FGM concentrations were higher in unprotected habitats, particularly when individuals were involved in agonistic interactions; seasonal variation in FGM concentrations was only detected in protected habitats. High FGM concentrations in black howler monkeys living in unprotected habitats are associated with increased within-group food competition and probably associated with exposure to anthropogenic stressors and overall food scarcity. Because persistent high GC levels can be detrimental to health and fitness, populations living in disturbed unprotected areas may not be viable in the long-term.","10.1371/journal.pone.0112329","CE","CE_6385",296,0.340658264244343,0.0483911445180659,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Results suggest that grazing regulation in recent decades may account for some of the changes seen in regional plants and small mammals over the past century. The incorporation of long-term exclosures in a comparative framework permits differentiation of the direct effects of grazing on biotic communities and thus provides a reference point for assessing the influence of grazing relative to other factors in the interpretation of historical change. © 2013.","10.3398/064.073.0403","CE","CE_6455",133,0.352402221697268,0.298962115028079,"150","neutral","neutral_150",0

The western lowland gorilla (WLG, Gorilla g. gorilla ) is persistently poached; infants are often illegally traded and used as pets. Some are confiscated and rehabilitated, then kept in sanctuaries or reintroduced into the wild. Prior to reintroduction, the ability of the orphans to survive independently in their environment needs to be assessed. Here, we performed a multivariate analysis, including diet composition, activity-budget, and pattern of strata using of a group of five juvenile WLG in the process of rehabilitation and distinguished three sub-periods of ecological significance: the high furgivory period, the Dialium fruits consumption period, and the high folivory period. The consequences of these variations on their well-being (play behaviour) and the group cohesion (spatial proximity and social interactions) were examined. Like wild WLGs, diets shifted seasonally from frugivorous to folivorous, while the same staple foods were consumed and large amounts of Dialium fruits were seasonally gathered high in trees. When succulent fruit intake was the highest, thus providing high energy from sugar, juveniles spent less time feeding, more time playing and group cohesion was the highest. Conversely, the cohesion decreased with increasing folivory, individuals spent more time feeding and less time playing together. Nonetheless, the group cohesion also decreased after the death of one highly social, wild-born orphan. This may underscore the importance of skilled individuals in the cohesion and well-being of the entire group and, ultimately, to rehabilitation success. This study evaluates the rehabilitation success with regards to the methods used and highlights the need to consider a set of individual and environmental factors for enhancing rehabilitation while preserving the local biodiversity and individual well-being.","10.1371/journal.pone.0119609","CE","CE_6535",305,0.37176202272314,0.137538708936017,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

In May 2007, a tropical storm on the east coast of Florida resulted in severe dune erosion and permission was given for beach and dune restoration. Nests already located on the beach, or that were laid prior to project commencement, were relocated at times varying between 10 days and 38 days post-deposition. This provided an opportunity to examine egg mortality in loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nests moved during this critical time period, and determine whether there was a correlation between the relocation and the timing of arrested egg development; we compared hatching and emergence success to nests relocated during the standard initial 12 hours post-deposition and those left in situ. Following hatchling emergence, we collected remaining unhatched eggs to determine development stage at the time of embryonic death. Mean hatch success was 53% for nests moved mid-incubation, versus 79-90% for nests left in situ or moved within 12 hours of deposition. For 6 of 10 nests, embryonic development ceased at the same visual developmental stage as the relocation. Although moving nests later than 12 hours decreases nest success and should be a matter of last resort, the forecasts for increased storm activity and sea level rise, and other impacts such as beach oiling, may necessitate nest relocation under less than ideal circumstances. Choice of relocation site may also be significant; nests placed in native sand had lower emergence success than those moved to the renourished area.","10.1002/jwmg.1023","CE","CE_6678",254,0.235642847711296,0.0399178854052039,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

These countries are involved in a Regional Sea Turtle Bycatch Program to achieve this goal. Circle hooks have been proposed as a way to mitigate incidental mortality of sea turtles. Thus, we analyze the performance of circle hooks in relation to J-style and tuna hooks on the hooking rates of target and non-target species in the artisanal surface longline fisheries of three of the participating countries with the largest sample sizes (Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica). These fisheries target mahi-mahi, Coryphaena hippurus, or a combination of tunas, billfishes and sharks (TBS), and use different techniques and gear configurations to catch their targets. For the TBS fishery we presented the results of comparisons between tuna hooks and 16/0 circle hooks from Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica, and between tuna hooks and 18/0 circle hooks in Costa Rica. For the mahi-mahi fishery, we analyzed the performance of 14/0 and 15/0 circle hooks in Ecuadorian vessels and 16/0 circle hooks in Costa Rican vessels vs. the traditional J-style hooks. A total of 730,362 hooks were observed in 3126 sets. Hooking rates for target and non-target species were not consistent for all fisheries and countries analyzed.

Females retain eggs in their oviducts and give birth to aquatic larvae or, in some populations, to fully metamorphosed juveniles. We investigated how variation in the birth size of larvae of five different sibships of S. salamandra affected larval survival, larval growth rates, time to metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis under different food and temperature conditions. Maternal effects, via the effect of larval birth size, attenuated throughout development in all environments but still affected metamorphic traits at lower temperatures. Larval developmental time was negatively correlated with larval birth size and positively correlated with size at metamorphosis. After controlling for the effect of larval birth size, broad-sense heritabilities were obtained for residual values of metamorphic traits, indicating that enough genetic variability exists at lower temperature environments and that responses to selection of metamorphic traits are possible. The size at and the time to metamorphosis were phenotypically and genetically correlated. Since both traits presumably affect fitness, genetic dependence between size and time to metamorphosis may act as a constraint on adaptive evolution through antagonistic pleiotropy. Mass-specific growth, time to metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis were plastic under different temperature and food conditions, but no significant sibship x environment interaction was found for any trait. In addition, significant cross-environment correlation for size at metamorphosis with respect to the food gradient indicates low potential for the adaptive evolution of reaction norms to heterogeneous food environments.","10.1655/03-55","CE","CE_6784",242,0.273728522412044,0.172028019789549,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Sizes were measured and developmental stages identified relative to age to the early feeding tadpole stage (Gosner stage 25) at increments of temperature. The numbers of abnormal embryos and larvae were recorded at every temperature and thermal tolerance was recorded. A direct correlation was found to exist between temperature and growth and developmental rates. The results also confirmed that the developmental rate decreases with decreasing temperature. Larvae at stage 25 showed a significant difference in length only between eggs incubated at 8 and 30°C, respectively. It is concluded that developing eggs have a temperature tolerance from 12 through 25°C, and temperatures outside this range will reduce their survival rate.",NA,"CE","CE_6786",221,0.244342264025713,0.178783471978553,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
6866,2013,"Mitigating the effect of development on bats in England with derogation licensing","Conservation Biology","The Convention on Biological Diversity has catalyzed worldwide awareness of threats to biological diversity and stimulated global conservation strategies. These have led to national and international legislation and have generated debate about the most effective conservation actions. Under the EU Habitats Directive, all member states are obliged to establish a system for strict protection of species listed in Annex IV(a), which includes all bats. In England, this obligation has resulted in legislation that allows for derogation from strict protection under license, provided activities are undertaken to mitigate any potential negative effects on bat numbers. We used an evidence-based approach to assess the cost-effectiveness of mitigation strategies and the English bat-derogation licensing process as a whole. We analyzed data from 389 bat derogation licenses issued in England from 2003 to 2005 relating to 1776 roosts and 15 species to determine the nature and extent of development and mitigation activities and their effects on bats. Overall the effects of licensed activities on roosts were negative. Despite the level of protection afforded to bats, the majority (68%) of roosts for which derogation licenses were issued were destroyed. There were species-specific differences in the probability of roosts being destroyed, and impacts on roosts did not reflect a species' conservation status. Information provided by licensees was inadequate and inconsistent. Most licensees (67%) failed to submit postdevelopment reports, and postdevelopment monitoring was conducted at only 19% of sites. Despite a minimum of £4.13 million spent on mitigation structures for bats from 2003 to 2005, it was unclear whether the licensing process meets EU obligations. On the basis of our results, we believe there is a need to overhaul the licensing process, to establish a comprehensive, standardized postdevelopment monitoring system, and to demonstrate that mitigation is commensurate with Britain's legal obligations. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/cobi.12154","CE","CE_6866",292,0.314639149426082,0.00877947558946854,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

In the United Kingdom, the exclusion of bats from roosts can be licensed under exceptional circumstances to alleviate conflict, but the fate of excluded bats and the impact on their survival and reproduction is not well understood. Using radiotracking, we investigated the effects of exclusion on the soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus, a species that commonly roosts in buildings in Europe. Exclusions were performed under licence at five roosts in England in spring, when females were in the early stages of pregnancy. Following exclusion, all bats found alternative roosts and colonies congregated in nearby known roosts that had been used by radio-tagged bats prior to exclusion. We found no difference in roosting behaviour before and after exclusion. Both the frequency of roost switching and the type of roosts used by bats remained unchanged. We also found no change in foraging behaviour. Bats foraged in the same areas, travelled similar distances to reach foraging areas and showed similar patterns of habitat selection before and after exclusion. Population modelling suggested that any reduction in survival following exclusion could have a negative impact on population growth, whereas a reduction in productivity would have less effect. While the number of soprano pipistrelle exclusions currently licensed each year is likely to have little effect on local populations, the cumulative impacts of licensing the destruction of large numbers of roosts may be of concern.","10.1371/journal.pone.0131825","CE","CE_6868",245,0.132287718096982,-0.19582759847583,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
6869,2015,"Green roofs provide habitat for urban bats","Global Ecology and Conservation","Understanding bat use of human-altered habitat is critical for developing effective conservation plans for this ecologically important taxon. Green roofs, building rooftops covered in growing medium and vegetation, are increasingly important conservation tools that make use of underutilized space to provide breeding and foraging grounds for urban wildlife. Green roofs are especially important in highly urbanized areas such as New York City (NYC), which has more rooftops (34%) than green space (13%). To date, no studies have examined the extent to which North American bats utilize urban green roofs. To investigate the role of green roofs in supporting urban bats, we monitored bat activity using ultrasonic recorders on four green and four conventional roofs located in highly developed areas of NYC, which were paired to control for location, height, and local variability in surrounding habitat and species diversity. We then identified bat vocalizations on these recordings to the species level. We documented the presence of five of nine possible bat species over both roof types: Lasiurus borealis, L. cinereus, L. noctivagans, P. subflavus,and. E. fuscus. Of the bat calls that could be identified to the species level, 66% were from L. borealis. Overall levels of bat activity were higher over green roofs than over conventional roofs. This study provides evidence that, in addition to well documented ecosystem benefits, urban green roofs contribute to urban habitat availability for several North American bat species.","10.1016/j.gecco.2015.07.011","CE","CE_6869",231,0.328474187680907,0.314072833489545,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

We tested the hypothesis that the number and diversity of insects captured and the resulting activity and diet of bats would differ between organic and conventional apple orchards. During the summer of 2009 and 2010, we captured 131 Big Brown Bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and five eastern red Bats (Lasiurus borealis) by mist netting in four organic and four conventional orchards in Michigan. Acoustic monitoring revealed that most calls (59%) were produced by Big Brown Bats, followed by Hoary Bats (L. cinereus), eastern red Bats, and unidentified species of Myotis. Most insects (96%) captured in light traps were Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, and trichoptera; fecal analysis indicated that Coleoptera dominated the diet of Big Brown Bats (79% by volume), followed by Diptera (14%). there were no significant differences between organic and conventional orchards in number of insects captured with light traps, bats captured with mist nets, acoustic recordings of bats, or proportion of Coleoptera and Diptera consumed by the bats. However, the taxonomic composition of captured insects and acoustic recordings was not homogenous among orchards in either group, suggesting that factors other than farming practices were more important in determining which insects and bats were found in the small orchards typical of southern Michigan.","10.22621/cfn.v128i2.1580","CE","CE_6871",218,0.28705945323961,0.0614551543710581,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Despite the Mediterranean basin being a biodiversity hotspot for conservation priorities, the potential benefits of organic farming for biodiversity there has received little attention. Here, we assessed the effect of farming system, landscape characteristics and habitat structure on biodiversity in Mediterranean vineyards using two taxa with different functional traits (in terms of mobility, dispersal ability and home range size): bats and arachnids. We also tested the intermediate landscape-complexity hypothesis, which predicts that local conservation measures have greatest success in landscapes of intermediate complexity. Our study design involved pairs of matched organic and conventional vineyard plots in the south of France situated along a landscape complexity gradient. Abundance of arachnids were higher in organic vineyards, although arachnid species richness was positively associated with the amount of ground vegetation cover. Organic farming was ineffective on its own to enhance bat activity and species richness regardless of the landscape context. Rather, our results suggested that landscape features were more important for bats than vineyard management, with significantly higher bat activity recorded on vineyard plots located at close proximity to hedgerows and rivers. When designing conservation strategies in Mediterranean farmlands, we strongly recommend the implementation of a multi-scale approach to assure benefits for a wide range of species.","10.1016/j.agee.2017.08.012","CE","CE_6872",235,0.254644964560397,0.434975387379413,"250","positive","positive_250",0
6873,2012,"Effects of agri-environment management for cirl buntings on other biodiversity","Biodiversity and Conservation","Agri-environment scheme (AES) management has increased populations of cirl buntings (Emberiza cirlus) in South Devon, England, and might be expected to provide benefits for other declining biodiversity, due to less intensive farm management. Fields managed under AES for cirl buntings (low-input spring barley or permanent pasture without inputs) were contrasted with control fields under conventional management (spring barley without management restrictions and winter cereals, or grazed without management restrictions) to identify such benefits for vascular plants, butterflies, bumblebees, carabid beetles, foliar invertebrates and bats. Activity-density and species richness of carabid beetles were both higher in AES spring barley fields than in control spring barley and winter cereal fields. Forb cover and abundance of butterflies and bumblebees were higher in AES spring barley fields than in winter cereals, but did not differ between AES and control spring barley. No difference was observed in plant species richness between any of the arable field types. Plant species richness and butterfly abundance were higher in AES pasture fields than in controls. Abundance, activity-density and/or species richness of other taxa did not differ between AES and control pastures. Benefits observed in AES spring barley fields arise from management specific to AES agreements, and also, we suggest, from the maintenance of spring-sown barley in the landscape. Benefits in AES pasture fields are ascribed to the absence of fertiliser and pesticide inputs, and reductions in stocking arising from this; there is also likely to have been some pre-selection for older pastures to be entered into AES management agreements. Agri-environment measures for cirl buntings have benefits for a range of taxa beyond the target species, and therefore, largely through reduction of management intensity and maintenance of land-use diversity, improve the overall biodiversity of the farmed landscape where they are present. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10531-012-0258-6","CE","CE_6873",307,0.127816634151709,0.213928705323712,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Aims We investigated the use of young (411 years old) timber plantations by bats in comparison with other vegetation classes in a highly cleared and productive agricultural landscape in north-west New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods Initially, we recorded activity in paddocks before plantation establishment, and then four to six years after establishment. We compared activity within young eucalypt plantations with surrounding paddocks and remnant woodland. We also radio-tracked four different bat species to investigate how roosting and foraging was apportioned into different habitats. Key results The ultrasonic survey of bats found that the young plantations were typically used by 78 species and activity averaged 87 passes per night. Activity within plantations was similar to treeless paddocks, and approximately six times less than in small remnants. The very high activity levels and feeding buzzes in small remnants was significantly related to rich, basalt soil (which was used as a proxy for invertebrate biomass) on agricultural plains. Total activity and species richness was correlated positively with the number of remnant trees on the site, but neither plantation area nor shape influenced bat activity. Plantations were not used preferentially by radio-tracked bats at night compared with their availability in the local landscape (1314% bat use, 17% available). No bat roosts were located within the plantations. Most bat roosts were in tree hollows, which were absent in the plantations. Decorticating bark was abundant in eucalypt plantations, but only Nyctophilus geoffroyi was observed beneath bark and only in remnant trees outside of plantations. Conclusions Young eucalypt plantations have limited value for bats, and this is comparable to previous studies on more environmentally focussed plantings. Implications The value of plantations for bats would be improved by retaining remnant trees, both in the surrounding landscape and within plantations. We also recommend varying tree densities to increase the diversity of animal species using plantations. © CSIRO 2011.","10.1071/WR10204","CE","CE_6877",335,0.170709792808453,0.124031851627209,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Using mixed effects models we demonstrated that both the richness and the total abundance of bats was higher in the diversified coffee plantations. We detected similar patterns on comparing the abundance of the four most abundant bat species. Neither season nor the season-agroecosystem interaction had any effect on the comparisons made. Using multiple regressions we found that the richness of plants that are useful to both people and bats had the most explanatory power for the richness and total abundance of frugivorous and nectarivorous bats, as well as for the abundance of Carollia sowelli, Glossophaga soricina and Sturnira spp. Our results indicate that agroecosystems value for conservation of fruit and nectar-eating bats increases as the fruit-bearing trees increases.

As land-use intensification alters habitat structure and resource availability, both factors may contribute to explaining differences in animal species diversity. Within the local animal assemblages the flying vertebrates, bats and birds, provide important and partly complementary ecosystem functions. We tested how bats and birds respond to land-use intensification and compared abundance, species richness, and community composition across a land-use gradient including forest, traditional agroforests (home garden), coffee plantations and grasslands on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Furthermore, we asked how sensitive different habitat and feeding guilds of bats and birds react to land-use intensification and the associated alterations in vegetation structure and food resource availability. In contrast to our expectations, land-use intensification had no negative effect on species richness and abundance of all birds and bats. However, some habitat and feeding guilds, in particular forest specialist and frugivorous birds, were highly sensitive to land-use intensification. Although the habitat guilds of both, birds and bats, depended on a certain degree of vegetation structure, total bat and bird abundance was mediated primarily by the availability of the respective food resources. Even though the highly structured southern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro are able to maintain diverse bat and bird assemblages, the sensitivity of avian forest specialists against land-use intensification and the dependence of the bat and bird habitat guilds on a certain vegetation structure demonstrate that conservation plans should place special emphasis on these guilds.","10.1111/btp.12221","CE","CE_6881",256,0.236506968759869,0.239887747034366,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

We implemented a 2-year study testing the effectiveness of an ultrasonic acoustic deterrent for reducing bat fatalities at a wind energy facility in Pennsylvania. We randomly selected control and treatment turbines that were searched daily in summer and fall 2009 and 2010. Estimates of fatality, corrected for field biases, were compared between treatment and control turbines. In 2009, we estimated 21-51% fewer bats were killed per treatment turbine than per control turbine. In 2010, we determined an approximate 9% inherent difference between treatment and control turbines and when factored into our analysis, variation increased and between 2% more and 64% fewer bats were killed per treatment turbine relative to control turbines. We estimated twice as many hoary bats were killed per control turbine than treatment turbine, and nearly twice as many silver-haired bats in 2009. In 2010, although we estimated nearly twice as many hoary bats and nearly 4 times as many silver-haired bats killed per control turbine than at treatment turbines during the treatment period, these only represented an approximate 20% increase in fatality relative to the pre-treatment period for these species when accounting for inherent differences between turbine sets. Our findings suggest broadband ultrasound broadcasts may reduce bat fatalities by discouraging bats from approaching sound sources. However, effectiveness of ultrasonic deterrents is limited by distance and area ultrasound can be broadcast, in part due to rapid attenuation in humid conditions. We caution that an operational deterrent device is not yet available and further modifications and experimentation are needed. Future efforts must also evaluate cost-effectiveness of deterrents in relation to curtailment strategies to allow a cost-benefit analysis for mitigating bat fatalities.","10.1371/journal.pone.0065794","CE","CE_6884",290,0.222885365602999,-0.206940027973331,"300","negative","negative_300",0

We conducted a 2-year study at the Sheffield Wind Facility in Sheffield, Vermont. Activity of bats is highest when winds speeds are low ( 9.5°C. Mortalities at fully operational turbines were 1.52-4.45 times higher than at treatment turbines. During late spring and early fall, when overnight temperatures generally fell below 9.5°C, incorporating temperature into the operational mitigation design decreased energy losses by 18%. Energy lost from implementation of our design was < 3% for the study season and approximately 1% for the entire year.

The impacts of roads on terrestrial fauna has been well studied, however little is known of the impact of roads on insectivorous bats. Wildlife crossing structures (e.g. fauna underpasses) may reduce the barrier impacts of roads and improve connectivity across roads. Use of underpasses by wildlife likely varies among species depending on their movement behaviour. In this study, we investigated whether the flight patterns of insectivorous bats influenced their use of underpasses. We monitored bat activity under and above 6 open-span bridges, 6 box culverts and 6 unmitigated sites along a major highway in Australia. We used Poisson regression models within a Bayesian framework of inference to compare the activity of 12 bat species (grouped into three guilds based on their flight patterns: clutter-adapted, edge-adapted, and open-adapted species) under the structures, over the road above the structures, above unmitigated segments of the highway, and in the vegetation adjacent to the roads. Bats were less active above the road than they were in the surrounding vegetation or under bridges. Two of the three guilds (i.e. seven species) crossed the highway more under bridges than they did under culverts or by going over the road, which suggests that bridges may reduce barrier effects of the road better than culverts. Installing bridges instead of culverts may better reduce the impacts of roads on multiple insectivorous bats species with a single structure type.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.05.022","CE","CE_6892",253,0.0969176101079976,0.0752767432396082,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
6893,2017,"Vegetated fauna overpass disguises road presence and facilitates permeability for forest microbats in Brisbane, Australia","Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","The effects of urbanization on flying vertebrates historically have been underestimated, with roads in particular impacting bat populations through vehicle collisions, habitat fragmentation and unwillingness to disperse across roads. Although vegetated fauna overpasses have not traditionally been considered as beneficial for microbats, these structures have recently been identified as a potential solution for assisting microbat communities. In Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, the Compton Road fauna overpass traverses a four-lane road, facilitating connectivity for mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians between two forest reserves. This study examined patterns of activity and species richness of microbat assemblages in relation to the Compton Road fauna overpass. Call recordings made over 7 months identified nine species and two species groups (groups of species unable to be differentiated), all of which were recorded using the overpass. Bat activity on the overpass was higher than in the adjoining forest, with higher detectability. Species richness and activity at the roadside where the overpass was present was also higher than the unvegetated roadside. Activity patterns based on feeding behaviors suggest that forest species such as Nyctophilus and Myotis spp. were using the overpass, alongside more generalist species. The vegetation on the overpass is likely to be the key factor encouraging microbat activity. The Compton Road overpass appears to lessen the impact of road presence and may facilitate permeability of a major road, suggesting potential for enhancing habitat connectivity and facilitating crossings. This study is the first indication that vegetated fauna overpasses can facilitate activity and provide natural habitat continuity for diverse Australian microbat communities.","10.3389/fevo.2017.00153","CE","CE_6893",254,0.203484313130609,0.152072274477599,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Thinning of these forests is a widespread management practice that can affect forest species, including echolocating bats and their prey. We compared total activity of 11 bat taxa, foraging activity of six bat guilds and biomass of 11 insect orders across four forest thinning categories in managed remnant eucalypt forests in south-eastern Australia: unthinned regrowth, forest thinned recently (04 years) and in the medium term (510 years) and reference (mature open forest). Thinning had been carried out at large (350 ha) spatial scales. Total bat activity was 60% less and foraging activity was 80% less in unthinned regrowth, compared to reference sites, but activity levels were similar among thinned and reference sites. Insect biomass was greatest in unthinned sites, and while bat activity was related to prey biomass, this relationship was weak in unthinned sites. Together, this suggests that forest structure was more important than prey availability or time since thinning in influencing bat activity patterns. Synthesizing our findings with the broader literature on bats and thinning, we found support for a clutter threshold of 1100 stems ha-1, above which bat activity was markedly lower, across two continents (the USA and Australia) and four broad vegetation types (eucalypt, conifer, deciduous and mixed forests). While elsewhere bats with adaptive traits for open habitats generally respond positively to thinning, in our study, species with traits consistent with clutter tolerance (high call frequency and low wing aspect ratio) had lowest activity levels (up to 22 times) in unthinned regrowth compared to all other forest types. Synthesis and applications. Widespread dense regrowth forest can restrict movement and foraging of bats, even those adapted to clutter. We recommend thinning dense regrowth or plantations to below 1100 stems ha-1 when targeting bat foraging habitat, but effects of thinning on roost habitat and other forest biota require further investigation.","10.1111/1365-2664.12691","CE","CE_6895",306,0.203247724054077,0.0569059947137081,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

In a recent pan-tropical assessment, Burivalova et al. [2] demonstrate the importance of logging intensity as a driver of biodiversity decline in timber estates. Their analyses reveal that species richness of some taxa could decline by 50% at harvest intensities of 38 m3 ha-1. However, they did not consider the extraction techniques that lead to these intensities. Here, we conduct a complementary meta-analysis of assemblage responses to differing logging practices: conventional logging and reduced-impact logging. We show that biodiversity impacts are markedly less severe in forests that utilise reduced-impact logging, compared to those using conventional methods. While supporting the initial findings of Burivalova et al. [2], we go on to demonstrate that best practice forestry techniques curtail the effects of timber extraction regardless of intensity. Therefore, harvest intensities are not always indicative of actual disturbance levels resulting from logging. Accordingly, forest managers and conservationists should advocate practices that offer reduced collateral damage through best practice extraction methods, such as those used in reduced-impact logging. Large-scale implementation of this approach would lead to improved conservation values in the 4 million km2 of tropical forests that are earmarked for timber extraction [3].","10.1016/j.cub.2014.10.067","CE","CE_6896",216,0.191776919381873,0.0970691871418737,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
6897,2015,"The effect of thinning on bat activity in Italian high forests: the LIFE+ ""ManFor C.BD."" experience","Hystrix, the Italian Journal of Mammalogy (English, 1994-)","Bats represent a major component of forest biodiversity. In forest, bats find many roosting and foraging opportunities. When foraging in forest, different bat species exploit a range of microhabitats according to their echolocation and flight style. When roosting, bats require sufficient numbers of suitable tree cavities. Overall, forest structure may influence both foraging and roosting behaviour, and in turn the number of bat species present and their population size. The exploitation of forests for commercial purposes may be a threat to biodiversity when logging leads to habitat loss, alteration or fragmentation. While some bat species may benefit from an increase in the amount of edge habitat determined by logging, others, more specialized to exploit forest interiors, may be potentially harmed. In this study we set out to assess the effect on foraging bats of different management approaches, comparing locally applied traditional approaches with innovative multifunctional management options and delayed logging. Within the framework of the LIFE+ ManFor C.BD. Project we surveyed the effects of thinning at four Italian forest sites, each representing a separate case study. We found that in logged plots bat activity either showed no difference from unlogged plots or resulted in an increase in foraging activity, suggesting that thinning, at least in the forest types we dealt with, has no adverse consequences on bat foraging. However, in our case the effects varied greatly across sites and were detected mostly when all bat species were pooled together for analysis. We conclude that forest exploitation may be sustainable and even favour foraging bats, but since our work neither covered direct mortality linked with forestry operations nor roost loss, further studies are needed to analyze these important aspects. We also highlight that total bat activity revealed by acoustic surveys carried out with automatic recorders may be used as an appropriate indicator of forestry effects on bats.","10.4404/hystrix-26.2-11477","CE","CE_6897",307,0.20764040755446,0.118893310984695,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

We estimated population growth rates at 20 hibernacula pre- and post-gating and quantified the change in population growth rates after gate installation. Hibernacula with increasing growth rates prior to gate placement all experienced decreased growth rates after installation. For hibernacula with declining growth rates prior to construction, growth rates increased moderately after installation. When weighted by population size, average change in growth rates across all 20 hibernacula was negative. Our results suggest that use of gates at hibernacula with growing populations may relate to unintended declines in growth rates but that, at hibernacula with declining populations, installation of gates may lead to moderate increases in local population growth rates. © Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.","10.3161/150811014X683345","CE","CE_6899",172,0.192060813667756,0.104987775333325,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

On the other hand, Myotis capaccinii (6.2%), M. escalerai (4.8%) and M. emarginatus (0.9%) showed significant, but minor increases, particularly in recent years. Rhinolophus mehelyi (0.2%) displayed no significant trends, while a moderate population decline was recorded for R. euryale (5.1%). Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (2.2%) and R. hipposideros (0.1%) showed positive growth trends. The main assemblages in the evaluated roosts were formed by Myotis myotis/blythii, Miniopterus schreibersii and R. ferrumequinum. This denotes their less specific requirements or greater flexibility when selecting roosts, compared with other species, except for M. capaccinii and R. mehelyi. No significant differences were found between roosts with different levels of protection, but there were positive trends in the protected roosts. Most non-fenced cavities showed negative trends during the period evaluated. We did not rule out other factors, such as requiring habitats with optimum food sources next to maternal roosts, which could affect population growth. The selectivity of some species of bats for certain caves will be essential for the preparation of management plans for certain roosts. Four of the seven risk factors documented for European bats affect studied population. Myotis blythii, M. myotis and Rhinolophus euryale would be most affected by a reduction in the areas they currently occupy.","10.3161/15081109ACC2017.19.1.008","CE","CE_6900",251,0.373621820514596,0.0929040538249482,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
6902,2013,"Prescribed fire in eucalypt woodlands: immediate effects on a microbat community of northern Australia","Wildlife Research","Context Fire is a major ecological factor in many landscapes. Prescribed fires are often used in the management of vegetation for ecological values, wildlife habitat and reduction of risk of wildfire. However, debate continues over whether active fire management is beneficial to flora and fauna. Although bats comprise ~20% of the world's extant mammal fauna, they have been largely ignored in studies investigating ecosystem response to fire, especially in Australia. Aims In the present study, we aim to investigate the immediate responses of microbats to prescribed fires in a tropical eucalypt woodland.Methods We used a replicated paired experimental design, consisting of burned and unburned treatment and control sites, to investigate how bat activity and community structure change following a prescribed fire. Key results Total bat activity increased significantly following fire. Fire also resulted in changes in the bat species assemblage. Changes in community structure were driven by the following five species: Saccolaimus spp., Chalinolobus nigrogriseus, Chaerephon jobensis, Rhinolophus megaphyllus and unidentified Species c35. Activity of C. nigrogriseus, Saccolaimus spp., C. jobensis and Species c35 increased in the burned sites, whereas changes in the activity of R. megaphyllus were uncorrelated with the effects of fire. Conclusions The effect of fire on these species is consistent with flight patterns and habitat use; species with higher wing aspect ratios, such as Saccolaimus spp., which are capable of fast flight but with limited manoeuvrability, became more active in the open conditions created by fire. Implications The results of the present study suggest that prescribed fire as an environmental management tool may be beneficial to bats, at least in the short term, because it increases habitat suitability for a wider range of species. © CSIRO 2013.",NA,"CE","CE_6902",279,0.165469627437458,0.0580520635725924,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
6903,2015,"Relationships between bat occupancy and habitat and landscape structure along a savanna, woodland, forest gradient in the Missouri Ozarks","Wildlife Society Bulletin","Many land-management agencies are restoring savannas and woodlands using prescribed fire and forest thinning, and information is needed on how wildlife species respond to these management activities. Our objectives were to evaluate support for relationships of bat site occupancy with vegetation structure and management and landscape composition and structure across a gradient of savanna to forest in the Missouri Ozark Highlands, USA. We selected study sites that were actively managed for savanna and woodland conditions and control areas on similar landforms that had succeeded to closed-canopy forest. We used Anabat detectors to survey bats during the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012. We fit single-species site-occupancy models to estimate detection probability and site occupancy. We evaluated a priori hypotheses in an information theoretic approach by evaluating support for candidate models that included habitat, landscape, and management effects. Site occupancy of evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) was negatively related to poletimber and sawtimber density and positively related to fire frequency, while northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) site occupancy was positively related to poletimber density and negatively related to understory stem densities. Site occupancy of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis), and tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) were mostly not related to local vegetation structure and site occupancy was high across the savanna, woodland, forest gradient. We found more consistent and larger effect sizes for landscape-scale than for habitat-scale relationships; therefore, land managers should be cognizant of large-scale patterns in land cover when making local management decisions for these species.

6904,2016,"Influence of reservoirs created by small dams on the activity of bats","Acta Chiropterologica","Freshwater systems have been profoundly changed by the construction of dams, and the influence of dams on bat activity is poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the effects of small dams along mountain streams on local bat communities. This work was carried out in five small streams located in the NE of Portugal using bioacoustic surveys during the summer of 2011. The present study confirms that, in the northeast areas of Portugal, the majority of bat species use artificial bodies of water for either drinking or foraging, but species differed in terms of their activity levels over the reservoirs when compared with intact stream habitats. As predicted, small dams in the study area were important centers of overall bat activity relative to other sampling areas. At the same time, feeding activity was also higher in the flooded areas. We also found that Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Myotis daubentonii, Pipistrellus kuhlii, Pipistrellus pygmaeus/Miniopterus schreibersii, Tadarida teniotis and Nyctalus leisleri/Eptesicus serotinus benefited from the presence of dam reservoirs. Hypsugo savii activity was also mostly recorded at reservoir points. However, the highest number of endangered and rare species was recorded at an intact stream habitat. This result emphasizes the relevance of riparian habitats for bats, especially for the most endangered species. The relationship between dam availability, riparian quality and bat diversity suggested that the changes in the streams promoted by damming could affect both bat species richness and activity levels, leading to changes in the overall composition of the bat community. In conclusion, this study found that small reservoirs have a significant influence on bat activity. However, dams appear to primarily benefit the most common species, while the endangered species were associated with riparian habitats. Therefore, for conservation proposes of the local bat community, riparian areas appear to be more important than reservoirs. Thus, this study provides a better understanding of the impact of small dams on bats contributing to the future management and conservation of bat species.","10.3161/15081109ACC2016.18.2.007","CE","CE_6904",325,0.328855389680525,0.120485742365,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
6906,2017,"Controlling invasive predators enhances the long-term survival of endangered New Zealand long-tailed bats (<i>Chalinolobus tuberculatus</i>): Implications for conservation of bats on oceanic islands","Biological Conservation","Invasive mammalian predators pose one of the greatest threats to biodiversity globally, particularly on oceanic islands. However, little is known about the impacts of these invasive predators on bats (Chiroptera), one of the most specious mammal groups, and one of the most widespread groups of mammals threatened on oceanic islands (> 200 spp.). Nearly 50% of the world's threatened bats are island endemics and because they are often the only native mammals on islands, they fulfil important ecological roles such as pollination and seed dispersal. Long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) are critically endangered because of predation by exotic mammals, particularly ship rats (Rattus rattus), introduced by humans to the island archipelago of New Zealand. We monitored the survival of bats in three colonies in temperate rainforest in Fiordland over 22 years. Since 2009, we controlled predators during irruption phases and compared survival of bats in previously untreated areas with survival in forest blocks treated using rodenticides deployed in bait stations. Survival was estimated using multi-state mark-recapture models in Program Mark 7.0 with > 15,000 bats tagged. Survival was primarily dependent on year and age of bats, although seedfall intensity of the dominant canopy tree and predator management was also influential. Survival in long-tailed bats was as high as, or higher, than figures for bats generally in years with low predator numbers or predator control. Survival was markedly higher in treatment years when predators were managed (0.82 compared to 0.55). Population modelling indicated managed colonies will increase ( > 1.05) whereas unmanaged colonies will decline ( = 0.89 - 0.98) under scenarios that reflect increased frequency of beech mast and predator irruptions. Thus, effective predator control is essential for recovering long-tailed bat populations. Warming temperatures indicate that predator irruptions are becoming more frequent, which would require more predator control in the future than at present if declines in bat populations are to be reversed. These results are relevant to the conservation of threatened bats on oceanic islands, given the abundance of exotic mammalian predators, particularly ship rats, on them.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.08.015","CE","CE_6906",324,0.288843494634063,0.105691724271916,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

The behavioral and physiological changes associated with hibernation leave bats vulnerable to WNS, but the persistence of bats within the contaminated regions of North America suggests that survival might vary predictably among individuals or in relation to environmental conditions. To investigate variables influencing WNS mortality, we conducted a captive study of 147 little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) inoculated with 0, 500, 5 000, 50 000, or 500 000 Pd conidia and hibernated for five months at either 4 or 10uC. We found that female bats were significantly more likely to survive hibernation, as were bats hibernated at 4uC, and bats with greater body condition at the start of hibernation. Although all bats inoculated with Pd exhibited shorter torpor bouts compared to controls, a characteristic of WNS, only bats inoculated with 500 conidia had significantly lower survival odds compared to controls. These data show that host and environmental characteristics are significant predictors of WNS mortality, and that exposure to up to 500 conidia is sufficient to cause a fatal infection. These results also illustrate a need to quantify dynamics of Pd exposure in free-ranging bats, as dynamics of WNS produced in captive studies inoculating bats with several hundred thousand conidia may differ from those in the wild.

However, effective disease control in wildlife is challenging because feasible management options are often lacking. White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an infectious disease of hibernating bats that currently threatens several North American species with extinction. Currently, no effective treatments exist for WNS. We conducted a laboratory experiment to test the efficacy of probiotic treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens, a bacterium that naturally occurs on bats, to reduce disease severity and improve survival of little brown bats Myotis lucifugus exposed to Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the fungal pathogen that causes WNS. We found that application of the probiotic bacteria at the time of fungal infection reduced several measures of disease severity and increased survival, whereas bacterial treatment prior to pathogen exposure had no effect on survival and worsened disease severity. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that probiotic treatment with Ps. fluorescens has potential for white-nose syndrome disease management, but the timing of application is critical and should coincide with natural exposure of bats to P. destructans. These results add to the growing knowledge of how natural host microbiota can be implemented as a biocontrol treatment to influence disease outcomes.","10.1111/1365-2664.12757","CE","CE_6908",204,0.303022194309159,-0.043944714771647,"250","neutral","neutral_250",1
6909,2015,"Community composition and activity of insectivorous bats in Mediterranean olive farms","Animal Conservation","Olive (Olea europaeaL.) farming is one of the most widespread agricultural practice throughout the Mediterranean basin. Current trends even predict an increase in land area devoted to olive farms as well as the intensification of farming practices. However, knowledge of the effects of olive farming on animal species still remains elusive and conservation and management guidelines for the relevant stakeholders are therefore urgently needed. Here, we investigate community composition and activity patterns of insectivorous bats in Mediterranean olive monocultures in Southern Portugal. Bats surveys were carried out in three types of olive farms representing increasing levels of management intensity: (1) traditional olive farms, managed with few or no chemical inputs or manual labor (2) semi-intensive olive farms, which share certain characteristics with traditional plantations, but are more intensively managed; (3) intensive olive farms, which are managed with high and frequent chemical inputs, and highly mechanized systems. We found differences in species richness and activity levels between farming practices. Both the number of species and foraging activity declined with increasing management intensity. However, olive groves as a whole showed a lower number of species compared with the regional species pool and extremely low activity levels, suggesting that large and homogeneous olive monocultures may serve more as commuting areas than true foraging habitats for bats. To our knowledge, this is the first study explicitly demonstrating the pervasive impact of olive farming on the community composition and activity levels of insectivorous bats. In the face of an even-increasing proportion of land surface devoted to olive farming in Mediterranean landscapes, our findings are therefore of great concern. We suggest that increasing habitat heterogeneity would contribute to preserve the community composition and ecological functionality of insectivorous bats in extensive olive monocultures.","10.1111/acv.12209","CE","CE_6909",285,0.221650954657742,0.26489452115923,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Each church was also classified according to the presence and amount of aesthetic directional lights (flood-lights) aimed on its walls and tower from the outside. Sixty-one of the churches had previously been surveyed by one of us (J.R.) between 1980 and 1990, before lights were installed on Swedish churches, using the same methods. Churches with bat colonies had decreased significantly in frequency from 61% in 1980s to 38% by 2016. All abandoned churches had been fitted with flood-lights in the period between the two surveys. The loss of bat colonies from lit churches was highly significant and most obvious when lights were applied from all directions, leaving no dark corridor for the bats to leave and return to the roost. In contrast, in churches that were not lit, all of 13 bat colonies remained after 25+ years between the surveys. Lighting of churches and other historical buildings is a serious threat to the long-term survival and reproduction of light-averse bats such as Plecotus spp. and other slow-flying species. Bat roosts are strictly protected according to the EU Habitats Directive and the EUROBATS agreement. Lighting of buildings for aesthetic purposes is becoming a serious environmental issue, because important bat roosts are destroyed in large numbers, and the problem should be handled accordingly. As a start, installation of flood-lights on historical buildings should at least require an environmental impact assessment (EIA).","10.1098/rsos.161077","CE","CE_6910",257,0.166032530004625,-0.0614319536881397,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Commuting and foraging bats have been found to be affected by ALAN, but no study has yet addressed the impact of lighting on drinking activity, despite its critical importance for bats. We experimentally illuminated cattle troughs used by drinking bats at four forest sites in Italy, and compared drinking activity and foraging activity under lit and dark conditions. We predicted that (1) the number of bat species and drinking events will be lower under illumination and (2) forest bat species will be more affected than edge specialists. We recorded 2549 drinking events from 12 species or species groups, most of which decreased drinking activity under illumination. The effects of ALAN on drinking were stronger than on foraging. Forest species never drank when the light was on. Edge-foraging species reduced drinking activity while also increasing foraging under lit conditions. We highlight a previously overlooked negative effect of ALAN on bats, whose implications may be locally catastrophic. Given the importance of water sites for both bat foraging and drinking, their illumination should be forbidden, appropriately mitigated or, if necessary, compensated for with the creation of alternative drinking sites.","10.1111/acv.12340","CE","CE_6913",194,0.108399459537447,-0.000717463041745582,"200","neutral","neutral_200",1

Although part-night lighting schemes have been adopted by many local authorities across Europe to reduce the carbon footprint and save energy, their effects on biodiversity are unknown. Through a paired, in situ experiment, we compared the activity levels of 8 bat species under unlit, part-night, and full-night lighting treatments in a rural area located 60 km south of Paris, France. We selected 36 study locations composed of 1 lit site and a paired unlit control site; 24 of these sites were located in areas subject to part-night lighting schemes, and 12 sites were in areas under standard, full-night lighting. There was significantly more activity on part-night lighting sites compared to full-night lighting sites for the late-emerging, light-sensitive Plecotus spp., and a similar pattern was observable for Myotis spp., although not significant. In contrast, part-night lighting did not influence the activity of early emerging bat species around streetlights, except for Pipistrellus pipistrellus for which there was significantly less activity on part-night lighting sites than on full-night lighting sites. Overall, no significant difference in activity between part- and full-night lighting sites were observed in 5 of the 8 species studied, suggesting that current part-night lighting schemes fail to encompass the range of activity of most bat species. We recommend that such schemes start earlier at night to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of artificial lighting on light-sensitive species, particularly along ecological corridors that are especially important to the persistence of biodiversity in urban landscapes.","10.1111/gcb.13036","CE","CE_6914",278,0.223914825871511,0.144210643336972,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
6916,2017,"Response of bats to light with different spectra: light-shy and agile bat presence is affected by white and green, but not red light","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","Artificial light at night has shown a remarkable increase over the past decades. Effects are reported for many species groups, and include changes in presence, behaviour, physiology and life-history traits. Among these, bats are strongly affected, and how bat species react to light is likely to vary with light colour. Different spectra may therefore be applied to reduce negative impacts. We used a unique set-up of eight field sites to study the response of bats to three different experimental light spectra in an otherwise dark and undisturbed natural habitat. We measured activity of three bat species groups around transects with light posts emitting white, green and red light with an intensity commonly used to illuminate countryside roads. The results reveal a strong and spectrum-dependent response for the slowflying Myotis and Plecotus and more agile Pipistrellus species, but not for Nyctalus and Eptesicus species. Plecotus and Myotis species avoided white and green light, but were equally abundant in red light and darkness. The agile, opportunistically feeding Pipistrellus species were significantly more abundant around white and green light, most likely because of accumulation of insects, but equally abundant in red illuminated transects compared to dark control. Forest-dwelling Myotis and Plecotus species and more synanthropic Pipistrellus species are thus least disturbed by red light. Hence, in order to limit the negative impact of light at night on bats, white and green light should be avoided in or close to natural habitat, but red lights may be used if illumination is needed.","10.1098/rspb.2017.0075","CE","CE_6916",252,0.261827324400903,0.208743207675612,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

A test using Spanish bats","Biodiversity and Conservation","One of the main aims of protected areas is to be effective in the conservation of target species, i.e. those of the highest conservation concern. The Natura 2000 network (N2000) of protected areas is the main pillar of European action to halt biodiversity loss. Within N2000, special areas of conservation (SACs) are designated to protect habitats and species of the highest conservation interest, i.e. habitats from Annex I and species (other than birds) listed in Annex II of the Habitat Directive. Thus, a critical and urgent task is to assess the effectiveness of N2000 in the protection of these species. Here, we used distribution data for Spanish bats to test whether the species included in Annex II are better represented in N2000 than the remaining bats found in Spain, since SAC sites were specifically designated to protect the former species. In general, we found significantly high overlapping values between species distribution and N2000 sites (both groups of species are in general over-represented in N2000). However, contrary to our expectations, N2000 (even when only SACs were considered) did not offer higher representation values for the species listed in Annex II than for other species. We found that N2000 performed well even for non-target species, and that species from Annex II could have acted as effective umbrella species for the remaining bat species. Finally, the usefulness of including a species in Annex II is discussed, and guidelines to improve the efficiency of the N2000 for bat conservation are offered.","10.1007/s10531-015-0937-1","CE","CE_6917",250,0.361269292748566,0.384275815852781,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Forest-dwelling bats are highly reliant on forest structures, such as snags and hollow trees, which the bats need as roosts. The decrease in such forest microhabitats significantly affects the habitat use and, therefore, the activity in forests. To determine whether N2000 beech forests under active timber production offer better habitats for bats compared to commercially used non-N2000 forests, we measured the bat activity and assessed the potential roosts in trees and snags in eleven pairs of stands. All survey stands represented mesotrophic beech forests (. Fagus sylvatica L.) of the N2000 habitat type 9130 (. Asperulo-Fagetum) in three European Biogeographic Regions. The activity of all bat species, the activity of priority N2000 species, the species number, the number of trees with roosts and the snag volume did not differ significantly between the N2000 and non-N2000 stands. We conclude that the current management of the N2000 beech forests is almost identical to that of non-N2000 commercial forests, and thus, the N2000 status has not led to an increase of bat-relevant habitat variables yet. Consequently, additional efforts beyond the administrative assignment of N2000 areas are required to build and ensure an ecologically effective and sustainable network of beech forests in Europe, including increasing important forest requirements for bats, such as roosts and snags.","10.1016/j.jnc.2014.07.003","CE","CE_6918",238,0.246199107353939,0.106489686164208,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Inside churches, bat droppings and urine can cause damage to the historic fabric of the building and to items of cultural significance. In extreme cases, large quantities of droppings can restrict the use of a church for worship and/or other community functions. In the United Kingdom, bats and their roosts are protected by law, and striking a balance between conserving the natural and cultural heritage can be a significant challenge. We investigated mitigation strategies that could be employed in churches and other historic buildings to alleviate problems caused by bats without adversely affecting their welfare or conservation status. We used a combination of artificial roost provision and deterrence at churches in Norfolk, England, where significant maternity colonies of Natterer's bats Myotis nattereri damage church features. Radio-tracking data and population modelling showed that excluding M. nattereri from churches is likely to have a negative impact on their welfare and conservation status, but that judicious use of deterrents, especially high intensity ultrasound, can mitigate problems caused by bats. We show that deterrence can be used to move bats humanely from specific roosting sites within a church and limit the spread of droppings and urine so that problems to congregations and damage to cultural heritage can be much reduced. In addition, construction of bespoke roost spaces within churches can allow bats to continue to roost within the fabric of the building without flying in the church interior. We highlight that deterrence has the potential to cause serious harm toM. nattereri populations if not used judiciously, and so the effects of deterrents will need careful monitoring, and their use needs strict regulation.","10.1371/journal.pone.0146782","CE","CE_6920",284,0.238341306548638,0.0925754548577988,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Currently, only nest boxes are commonly used to mitigate or offset lost cavity-bearing trees, with a number of shortfalls reported using this technique. There is a need to trial alternative techniques to improve artificial cavity provisions. This preliminary study investigated the use of carving hollows directly into tree trunks using chainsaws. Sixteen hollows of two simple cavity types were created in a timber production forest in south-eastern Australia. One cavity type comprised a basal entrance (38 mm in diameter) which provided a space above the entrance, intended for bats, and the other cavity type provided a space below a 38 mm or 76 mm entrance, intended for marsupials and birds. Five species used the hollows over a 15-month cavity monitoring period; feathertail glider (Acrobates pygmaeus) (in 75% of the hollows), brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii) (75%), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) (63%), long-eared bat (Nyctophilus sp.) (50%) and white-throated treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaea) (25%). Camera monitoring revealed hollow inspection after only one day post hollow creation by white-throated treecreepers and feathertail gliders, and nest building by white-throated treecreepers after three days. No hollow host tree failure occurred for either of the two hollow wall widths trialled over two years of monitoring tree stability. Wound-wood formed and partly enclosed the hollows faceplates over time, improving the sturdiness of the hollow and likely resulted in hollows closely resembling natural cavities. Mechanically created tree hollows have a broad application potential across many landscapes with the prospect to overcome some of the reported drawbacks of nest boxes.

6924,2017,"Habitat features act as unidirectional and dynamic filters to bat use of production landscapes","Biological Conservation","Conserving global biodiversity requires careful management of production landscapes, especially in this era of rapid environmental change. The habitat filtering framework has been used for predicting species responses to land-use changes. Habitat filters are essentially features that may slow, or limit, species use of certain habitats. We wanted to determine if this framework could identify habitat and landscape filters that predicted bat use of restored forest at the species-specific and trait group levels. We surveyed bat activity, vegetation structure, and landscape characteristics at 64 sites over two years in restored northern jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests of south-western Australia. Filters to use of restored forest were present for all bats, other than the open space group. We detected dynamic filters to use of restored forest by the open space edge group and unidirectional filters for the closed space edge and closed space groups. Filters to bat use of restored forests were species-specific and related to habitat, rather than landscape, features. In landscapes with relatively low patch-matrix contrast, such as the northern jarrah forest, management actions to reduce filters should focus on habitat features. To manage for the persistence of specific species within restored forest patches, tree density and midstory cover should aim to be at, or close to, reference forest levels.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.02.024","CE","CE_6924",214,0.186593500056678,0.240999961160455,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
6925,2015,"Effect of water quality on species richness and activity of desert-dwelling bats","Mammalian Biology","Natural bodies of open water in desert landscapes are important resources for survival of desert-dwelling animals and in recent years artificial bodies of water may have become equally important. In the present study we are testing if species richness and activity of bats are related to the water chemistry both in natural and artificial bodies of water, and if these measures can indicate water quality in desert habitats where water is scarce. We combined acoustic monitoring of bat activity and species richness in artificial and natural bodies of water in the Negev desert, Israel and measured 27 variables of water chemistry and quality at each site. Significant differences in water chemistry and quality were found between natural and artificial bodies of water. Species richness and activity of bats did not differ between artificial and natural bodies of water, indicating that desert-dwelling bats may benefit from artificial bodies of water, however activity within species differed between natural and artificial bodies of water. Some species of bats were only recorded at natural bodies of water, suggesting that these species are not tolerant to lower quality of water and emphasizes the importance of natural bodies of water in desert ecosystems. Our results demonstrate that community measures, such as total bat activity and species richness of bats in desert habitats, may not be sufficient to indicate changes in water chemistry and quality. Rather it is recommended and applicable to use the activity of specific species as indicators of water quality in desert habitats.","10.1016/j.mambio.2015.03.009","CE","CE_6925",250,0.309688047885797,0.171055741591546,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
6926,2013,"Artificial wetlands and surrounding habitats provide important foraging habitat for bats in agricultural landscapes in the Western Cape, South Africa","Biological Conservation","Agriculture and related habitat modification have been identified as globally important drivers of species loss. Habitat modification resulting from agriculture can, however, have both positive and negative consequences for animal species. The ecological trade-offs involved in agricultural development have often not been explored sufficiently well to identify mutually beneficial solutions. Bats, for example, have been strongly impacted by agriculture intensification, mainly through the destruction of forests and natural wetlands. However, artificial wetlands created primarily for irrigation in agricultural landscapes may provide foraging habitats for bats and thus contribute to both the conservation of bat species and the regulation of insect pest species. We studied the influence of artificial wetlands on bat communities in agricultural landscapes in South Africa. We used mixed models to assess spatial variations in species richness, total bat activity, and species activity across 30 landscapes. Each study site was centred on a 'focal wetland' and surrounded by various habitat categories: open habitat, vineyards, orchards and trees. Our results show a crucial role of wetlands for all bat species as well as a significant influence of wetland size and water cover on bat activity. However, we observed no significant difference in species richness and only small differences in activity levels between the 'focal wetland' and the surrounding habitats. The present study contributes to the body of literature suggesting that farm dams may act as biodiversity hotspots when properly managed. More generally, our analysis suggests that an in-depth understanding of the trade-offs between agricultural production and ecosystem integrity is important for finding mutually beneficial outcomes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2013.04.017","CE","CE_6926",260,0.186023545459316,0.145002417261445,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
6927,2016,"Activity of insectivorous bats is related to water availability in a highly modified Mexican temperate forest","Acta Chiropterologica","Artificial ponds are important foraging and drinking resources for bats at La Michilía, a temperate forest with a marked seasonal drought. Using acoustic data we tested the hypothesis that water availability restricts bat activity in the dry season to ponds, whereas in the rainy season resources are widely available and therefore used throughout the area. We compared bat activity at six ponds with that of a 500-meter transect perpendicular to each pond. We predicted that activity would be higher at ponds in the dry season, whereas in the rainy season activity should be equal or higher at transects. Also, all species guilds would use ponds in the dry season, whereas gleaners, edge aerial and open aerial foragers would be more frequent at transects in the rainy season. In no instance activity was higher at transects than at ponds during the rainy season. Open areas showed little or no bat activity in the dry season, but were very active in the rainy season. One transect located in dense forest and one near human dwellings were active both seasons. Open aerial foragers were present mostly on ponds in the dry season, and on ponds and transects in the rainy season; edge aerial bats were common in ponds in the dry season, but rare in transects in the rainy season. Trawling bats used ponds and transects in both seasons; and gleaners were rare over ponds and transects in both seasons. Because bats use the local habitat differently depending on season and feeding guild, and climate and seasonality vary greatly in Mexican temperate forests, conservation strategies can not be generalized, but should be implemented on a case-by-case basis.","10.3161/15081109ACC2016.18.2.008","CE","CE_6927",276,0.187906762700958,-0.0873956038875515,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

6932,2013,"Artificial bat roosts did not accelerate forest regeneration in abandoned pastures in southern Costa Rica","Biological Conservation","Artificial roosts have been proposed as a tool for augmenting bat populations and catalyzing tropical forest regeneration. In the best case scenario, roosts would attract seed-carrying bats (Family Phyllostomidae) into degraded pastures and form nucleating patches of native vegetation. We tested this scenario by monitoring 48 artificial roosts in pastures and adjacent forest fragments in southern Costa Rica over 2. years. Half of the pasture roosts were exposed to direct sunlight and half were affixed to 4-m living stakes of Erythrina poeppigiana (Walp.) O.F. Cook that provided shade. After 2. years, 94% of roosts in forest and 40% of roosts in pasture had been used by bats at least once - primarily for nocturnal feeding. Maximum daily temperature inside of roosts was the best microclimatic predictor of bat visitation. We identified at least five species of bats that visited roosts, including two frugivores (Carollia and Glossophaga spp.). Bat-mediated seed dispersal increased with the number of frugivorous bat detections at roosts, but seedling recruitment did not increase with either bat detections or seed abundance over a 2-year period. Given that bats rarely used roosts in pastures, and bat visitation did not increase seedling recruitment, our data suggest that artificial bat roosts did not accelerate forest regeneration in abandoned, premontane pastures in southern Costa Rica. This method could be refined by investigating alternative roost designs, barriers to seedling recruitment below roosts, improvement of roost microclimatic conditions in pastures, and ability of bats to detect roosts in different habitats. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2013.06.026","CE","CE_6932",245,0.157797344065105,0.0326228242767783,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

In this study, summer roost site selection of pregnant and lactating soprano pipistrelles were investigated using radio telemetry (2004-2006) in a fiord landscape with complex topography at the species northern extreme. The soprano pipistrelles' common roost sites were in hollow trees (n = 14), but they also used crevices in rock walls (n = 2) and the attic of one building. The bats exclusively sought out roosts on the north side of the fiord with the slope facing south, where solar irradiation yielded the warmest micro climate. From 2005 to 2014, bat boxes were erected at three sites in the study area. From 2012 to 2014 we only found maternity roosts in such structures, thus there was a clear shift in roost site selection by the soprano pipistrelle in the study area. Man-made structures, such as buildings and bat boxes, provided the warmest cavities, whereas natural cavities did not differ significantly from air temperatures. The bats did not find thermo neutral roosts most of the time, and this should affect the energy budgets, and thus the bats' behaviour. Direct observation of predation at roosts in build-up areas suggests that living close to humans could be costly to bats emerging in daylight conditions. No predation attempts were recorded at roosts in woodland habitats.","10.3161/150811014X687305","CE","CE_6933",230,0.111635417393203,0.0605667995166696,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Bat boxes have been used for over a century to provide artificial cavities. The aims of this review were to provide a synthesis of bat box use in temperate parts of the world, to discuss the applications and effectiveness of bat boxes, to provide box deployment recommendations and to identify areas requiring further research. The 109 publications reviewed originated from four regions. The majority were from Europe (70%) followed by North America (16%), Australia (12%) and Asia (3%). Publications reported box use for research (n = 67), conservation management (n = 42) and public bat awareness (n = 1). The most commonly used bat box designs could be divided into five basic types, four originating from Europe and one from North America. Woodcement as a box material was frequently used in Europe and was practically absent elsewhere with timber boxes most commonly used overall. Seventy-one species of bats have been recorded using boxes, although only 18 were identified as using boxes commonly and 31 species were reported to have formed maternity roosts. The lack of maternity and overwintering roost records in boxes is a concern. There is a need to test current box types across geographical regions and to develop designs further. Where boxes are used as a conservation tool, consideration should be given to the long-term maintenance costs of a box program. Unless known to be unsuitable to target species, boxes should be made from durable materials, be unattractive to non-target species and be 'self-cleaning'. Deploying a variety of box designs in clusters, time since box installation, non-target species box competition and target species-specific box design elements are likely influencing box uptake. The provision of boxes that comprise different microclimates and box aspects are likely best suited to meet the varying needs of a given tree roosting echolocating bat community. No conclusive evidence was found that box installation height is important for box uptake. There is concern that boxes may provide a competitive advantage for bat species commonly using boxes. Bat boxes should not be used as a justification for the removal of trees that comprise potential roost cavities.","10.3161/15081109ACC2016.18.1.017","CE","CE_6936",356,0.217740202015281,0.0599498771987114,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

6939,2017,"Bat boxes in urban non-native forests: a popular practice that should be reconsidered","Urban Ecosystems","Impact mitigation practices are currently one of the hottest topics in conservation and regarded as priorities worldwide. Forest bat populations are known to provide important ecosystem services such as pest control and bat boxes have become one of the most popular management options for counteracting the loss of roosts. However, bat boxes tend to be employed in non-native forests near highly humanized areas where human disturbance is higher. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the surrounding landscape composition affects bat box occupancy in urban non-native forests along the Mediterranean corridor in the Northeastern Iberian Peninsula. Two hundred wooden bat boxes were monitored in young non-native forests in the period 20042012. The influence of land cover on occupancy rate of bat boxes was analysed at the landscape level in a 5 km buffer around bat-box stations. In total, 1659 inspections were carried out, in which a 15 % occupancy rate was detected. Bat boxes hosted three different species (Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri). More than 70 % of the occupancy can be explained by habitat and spatial composition. The presence of urban areas around bat boxes tends to have a negative impact on bat occupation rates; by contrast, forest coverage has a positive effect, especially for the tree-dwelling bats. These patterns could be associated with the large number of available roosts in buildings, microhabitat or phylopatry. Thus, to increase success, we suggest that landscape composition should be considered when using bat boxes for conservation.","10.1007/s11252-016-0582-9","CE","CE_6939",246,0.191208161397632,0.120484827421859,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Here, we present further evidence of short-term, post-release survival and also demonstrate longer term survival using re-sighting data of ringed common (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and soprano (Pipistrellus pygmaeus) pipistrelle bats. Ten bats (five common and five soprano pipistrelles) were radio-tracked for between one and ten days. Three of these were retrieved after one, two and four days, respectively.

We radio-tracked 21 hand-reared Pipistrellus kuhlii over a two-year period released on a site that differed from that where they were rescued. At the study site they were provided with the same bat boxes used in the rehabilitation room. Nineteen bats were confirmed to survive, stay in the area and actively forage over 4-14 days. Fourteen day roosts in buildings (nine of which hosted a local colony) were used by 12 subjects. Bats travelled less than 5 km in total each night; their most frequent activity was night roosting, followed by foraging and commuting. We recorded typical foraging behaviour, including hunting around street lamps at sites exploited by many conspecifics. A comparison of habitats available within individual home ranges with those within the study area showed that urban areas, riparian vegetation and farmland were equally important and preferred to woodland. When the foraging time spent in each habitat was compared with habitat composition within individual home ranges or within the study area, urban sites were preferred for foraging over all other habitats, followed by farmland and woodland and finally riparian vegetation.

Although pandalid shrimps were shown to be very abundant in this region, information is lacking regarding the best fishing method for catching the different species of shrimp. Here, two types of traps were tested, a semi-floating shrimp trap and a traditional bottom trap, in an effort to improve the fishing gear effectiveness and to reduce the capture of non-target species. In total, nine species were captured, which were categorised into three main groups based on their depth of capture: Plesionika edwardsii, P. narval and P. holtuisi (100-400 m); P. ensis, P. martia, P. williamsi and Heterocarpus ensifer (400-800 m); and H. grimaldii and H. laevigatus (800-1 300 m). Significant differences were found in the capture of the different species: P. narval, P. ensis, P. edwardsii and H. ensifer were captured more readily using the semi-floating traps, whereas P. martia, P. williamsi, H. grimaldii and H. laevigatus were caught more efficiently with traditional bottom traps. This intra-specific difference in their capture was considered to be due to the differential motility of the species in the water column. There were indications that P. edwardsii and H. ensifer are an unexploited resource that has the potential to support a viable and sustainable fishery using semi-floating shrimp traps.

A significant portion of the drag-generated, netting tension of the W trawl is directed away from the wings to centre-line bracing ropes that are connected to a central towing wire through an intermediary sled. This configuration facilitates substantially smaller otter boards than normal, and consequently less drag and seabed contact. Here we compared the engineering and catching implications of subtle, progressive rigging changes to a W trawl paired against a standard Florida flyer trawl; both rigged with another eco-efficient modification, termed the 'batwing' otter board (suitably sized for each trawl). The W-trawl refinements included: (i) securing netting at the wing ends to prevent sliding; (ii) moving the headline forward and footrope aft; and (iii) inserting dan lenos at the wing ends. The first two modifications resulted in a maximum drag reduction by the W trawl of up to 11% for a 1.14 × increase in spread. Catches ha-1 of mostly retained (commercially important) large brachyurans and cephalopods were maintained, but penaeid catches were reduced in the W trawl (by at least 33%), which was mostly attributed to less than optimal ground-gear contact.

A series of descriptive field studies were performed to assess fish and benthic communities between two areas within a newly established MPA in SW Portugal. We characterized benthic macroalgal composition and determined the size, density and biomass of the main benthic predatory and herbivorous fish species as well as the main benthic herbivorous invertebrates to assess indications of top-down control on the phytobenthic assemblages. Fish species were identical inside and outside the MPA, in both cases Sarpa salpa was the most abundant fish herbivore and Diplodus spp. accounted for the great majority of the benthic predators. However, size and biomass of D. spp. were higher inside than outside the MPA. The main herbivorous invertebrate was the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, which was smaller and predominantly showing a crevice-dwelling behaviour in the MPA. In addition, P. lividus size frequency distribution showed a unimodal pattern outside and a bimodal pattern inside the MPA. We found significant differences in the algal assemblages between inside and outside the MPA, with higher abundance of turf and foliose algae inside, and articulated calcareous and corticated macrophytes outside the MPA, but no differences in the invasive Asparagopsis spp. The obtained results show differences in predatory fish and benthic community structure, but not in species richness, inside and outside the MPA. We hypothesize these differences lead to variation in species interactions: directly through predation and indirectly via affecting sea urchins behavioural patterns, predators might drive changes in macroalgal assemblages via trophic cascade in the study area. However due to non-biological differences between the two areas it is difficult to suggest that the MPA causes increased biological parameters of targeted species and to assess predatory control and trophic cascade effects in areas where fishing pressure is reduced. It is therefor advisable to design MPAs so that their impacts can be scientifically evaluated in a proper fashion.","10.1016/j.marenvres.2015.12.003","CE","CE_7044",347,0.214049854585797,0.183728456196307,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
7049,2015,"Sessile and mobile components of a benthic ecosystem display mixed trends within a temperate marine reserve","Marine Environmental Research","Despite recent efforts to increase the global coverage of marine protected areas (MPAs), studies investigating the effectiveness of marine protected areas within temperate waters remain scarce. Furthermore, out of the few studies published on MPAs in temperate waters, the majority focus on specific ecological or fishery components rather than investigating the ecosystem as a whole. This study therefore investigated the dynamics of both benthic communities and fish populations within a recently established, fully protected marine reserve in Lamlash Bay, Isle of Arran, United Kingdom, over a four year period. A combination of photo and diver surveys revealed live maerl (Phymatolithon calcareum), macroalgae, sponges, hydroids, feather stars and eyelash worms (Myxicola infundibulum) to be significantly more abundant within the marine reserve than on surrounding fishing grounds. Likewise, the overall composition of epifaunal communities in and outside the reserve was significantly different. Both results are consistent with the hypothesis that protecting areas from fishing can encourage seafloor habitats to recover. In addition, the greater abundance of complex habitats within the reserve appeared to providing nursery habitat for juvenile cod (Gadus morhua) and scallops (Pecten maximus and Aequipecten opercularis). In contrast, there was little difference in the abundance of mobile benthic fauna, such as crabs and starfish, between the reserve and outside. Similarly, the use of baited underwater video cameras revealed no difference in the abundance and size of fish between the reserve and outside. Limited recovery of these ecosystem components may be due to the relatively small size (2.67 km2) and young age of the reserve (<5 years), both of which might have limited the extent of any benefits afforded to mobile fauna and fish communities. Overall, this study provides evidence that fully protected marine reserves can encourage seafloor habitats to recover, which in turn, can create a number of benefits that flow back to other species, including those of commercial importance.","10.1016/j.marenvres.2015.03.009","CE","CE_7049",308,0.360234799450778,0.383980877225081,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Pots have been suggested as an alternative fishing method that would reduce the high levels of fish bycatch in the New Zealand scampi (Metanephrops challengeri) trawl fishery. This hypothesis was assessed by comparing the bycatch rates from four different designs of pots used in similar deep sea lobster fisheries overseas. The effects of bait and location on bycatch were also assessed by using three different bait types and fishing the pots at two different scampi commercial fishing sites around 200 km apart. The different pot designs were observed to significantly affect the bycatch of hagfish (Eptatretus cirrhatus) and total bycatch at both sites, while at the Chatham Rise site the bycatch of fish species and invertebrate was also affected by pot design. The pot design with the highest levels of bycatch at both sites was Pot 2, a two-chambered parlour pot which caught between 1.510.1 times more total bycatch than the other pot designs. Additionally, both hagfish and total bycatch showed significant spatial variation at two scales; among individual deployments of strings of pots within locations, and among locations within the sites. The bycatch from the pots included proportionately more invertebrates and hagfish, and less other fish species when compared to previous studies analysing the bycatch of the trawl fishery for New Zealand scampi. The results indicate that the development of potting methods for New Zealand scampi has the potential to reduce bycatch of some fish species, but will need to focus on reducing hagfish and invertebrate bycatch through improved pot design and spatially-targeted fishing.","10.1016/j.fishres.2016.08.005","CE","CE_7083",302,0.26281003177621,0.101526034608108,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Pulse trawl landings were lower both expressed in kgh-1 (67% based on auction data) or baskets per hectare (81%).The pulse trawls had fewer fish discards (57%, p<. 0.0001), including 62% undersized plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.)

The success of MPAs stems from the overall positive benefits attributed to the ""reserve effect,"" the totality of the consequences of protecting marine systems. The reserve effect includes but is beyond the goal of protecting particular species or areas with economical or cultural value. However, most data on the effects of MPAs focus on target species and there is limited evidence for the consequences of protection at larger levels of organization. Quantitative information on the reserve effect remains elusive partly because of its complex nature. Data on biodiversity can be used to quantify the reserve effect if not restricted to specific taxonomic groups. In our study, we quantified species diversity, trophic diversity, and an approach to functional diversity in five MPAs and adjacent non-protected areas along the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Our three measures of diversity were based on the abundance of algae, fish, sessile and mobile invertebrates in shallow water rocky communities and could be used to estimate the reserve effect based on species, trophic levels, or functional roles. We tested the hypothesis that species, trophic, and functional diversity were higher in protected areas than in adjacent non-protected areas. Species diversity varied with geographic area but not with protection status. However, we found higher functional diversity inside MPAs. Also, the effect of protection on functional diversity varied as a function of the geographic area. Our results support the uniqueness of MPAs at a species level and the universality of the reserve effect at the level of the trophic groups' composition. This type of comprehensive ecological approach may broaden our understanding of MPAs and their efficiency as management tools. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.seares.2012.07.002","CE","CE_7140",293,0.318263589921279,0.221283577342875,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
7185,2017,"Bat activity in rice paddies: organic and conventional farms compared to unmanaged habitat","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","Many bat species in Europe have suffered severe population declines during the 20th century, and the main drivers of this decline is likely the loss of foraging habitats at local and landscape levels due to farmland intensification, which also poses a serious threat to biodiversity and affects species interactions and ecosystem functions. Several studies reported positive effects of organic compared to conventional farming on bat populations and on nocturnal insect prey abundance. We registered the flight and feeding activity of 12 bat species in rice paddies in Northwestern Italy to test the effect of wetland farm management and agricultural intensification on bats habitat use. Our study evaluated the different ecological roles of organic vs conventional rice farms and natural wetlands in conservation of bat species. For the 12 species under study, flying activity was recorded in all three land management types. Only the genus Pipistrellus hunted in conventional and organic farms. Myotis sp, Eptesicus serotinus and Hypsugo savii were recorded hunting only in natural wetlands. Rinolophus ferrumequinum was detected only in natural wetlands. Bats fed in organic farms as well as in natural wetlands, whereas they were unlikely to forage in conventional farms. Conventional rice paddies do not provide ideal foraging sites for bats, likely due to the widespread use of pesticides, water management, and intensive weed control on embankments. Organic rice paddies, due to the less aggressive management, appear to have a higher habitat quality compared to conventional ones, and are therefore more suitable for feeding activities, possibly due to the greater availability of prey. Furthermore, while the limited ecological value of conventional farms for bat conservation is confirmed in this research for rice paddies, further effort should be made to preserve natural wetlands. We argued that farmland practices that maximise organic farming and ensure the conservation of natural wetlands, in accordance with the recent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, are essential for bat conservation in agricultural environments and, more generally, to preserve biodiversity.","10.1016/j.agee.2017.08.022","CE","CE_7185",324,0.378694931923355,0.0895854582319754,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
7186,2018,"Tillage and herbicide reduction mitigate the gap between conventional and organic farming effects on foraging activity of insectivorous bats","Ecology & Evolution","The increased use of pesticides and tillage intensification is known to negatively affect biodiversity. Changes in these agricultural practices such as herbicide and tillage reduction have variable effects among taxa, especially at the top of the trophic network including insectivorous bats. Very few studies compared the effects of agricultural practices on such taxa, and overall, only as a comparison of conventional versus organic farming without accurately accounting for underlying practices, especially in conventional where many alternatives exist. Divergent results founded in these previous studies could be driven by this lack of clarification about some unconsidered practices inside both conventional and organic systems. We simultaneously compared, over whole nights, bat activity on contiguous wheat fields of one organic and three conventional farming systems located in an intensive agricultural landscape. The studied organic fields (OT) used tillage (i.e., inversion of soil) without chemical inputs. In studied conventional fields, differences consisted of the following: tillage using few herbicides (T), conservation tillage (i.e., no inversion of soil) using few herbicides (CT), and conservation tillage using more herbicide (CTH), to control weeds. Using 64 recording sites (OT = 12; T = 21; CT = 13; CTH = 18), we sampled several sites per system placed inside the fields each night. We showed that bat activity was always higher in OT than in T systems for two (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus pipistrellus) of three species and for one (Pipistrellus spp.) of two genera, as well as greater species richness. The same results were found for the CT versus T system comparison. CTH system showed higher activity than T for only one genus (Pipistrellus spp.). We did not detect any differences between OT and CT systems, and CT showed higher activity than CTH system for only one species (Pipistrellus kuhlii). Activity in OT of Pipistrellus spp. was overall 3.6 and 9.3 times higher than CTH and T systems, respectively, and 6.9 times higher in CT than T systems. Our results highlight an important benefit of organic farming and contrasted effects in conventional farming. That there were no differences detected between the organic and one conventional system is a major result. This demonstrates that even if organic farming is presently difficult to implement and requires a change of economic context for farmers, considerable and easy improvements in conventional farming are attainable, while maintaining yields and approaching the ecological benefits of organic methods.","10.1002/ece3.3688","CE","CE_7186",384,0.246079514049772,0.158574365211979,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

While practices characteristic of agricultural intensification tend to erode biodiversity, agroecological farming practices can potentially support biodiversity and enhance pest suppression services. Bats are important predators of agricultural pests, yet little is known about how prescriptive management practices can be used to support bats and their associated pest-suppression services. We investigate how bats use natural habitat and conventional and organic farms in an agricultural landscape, ask which on-farm management practices may benefit bats, and examine how these management practices influence bats by mediating changes in habitat quality. We conducted acoustic surveys at 54 sites in the California Central Coast Region, a productive region with high ecological and economic value. We found higher bat activity in natural habitat compared to farms for total bat activity and clutter-adapted, but not open space bats, and slightly higher bat diversity in natural habitat compared to conventional farms. We found no effect of habitat type on species richness and a weak effect of habitat type on bat diversity, although bat community composition differed significantly between natural habitat and farms. Crop diversification increased the activity of all bat species and clutter-adapted, but not open space bats, regardless of the amount of semi-natural habitat surrounding farms. Both crop diversification and less frequent pesticide applications increased prey biomass, and the activity of clutter-adapted bats was positively correlated with greater Lepidoptera biomass. We suggest that improving habitat quality (increasing abundance of insect prey) through vegetative diversification and/or less frequent pesticide applications offers flexible management options to growers by considering both bat ecology and the constraints of regional agricultural management practices.","10.1016/j.agee.2018.06.008","CE","CE_7187",293,0.287357120445672,0.357697070714115,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

One widespread problem with previous studies is that most do not control for differences in field structure and landscape composition at organic and conventional farms. Thus, the effects observed may be due to factors other than organic farming practices. We addressed this problem by selecting matched organic-conventional pairs of soybean fields such that in each pair the soybean fields were similar in size, hedgerow length, and surrounding landscape composition within 1 km, 2 km and 3 km of the fields. At each of our 16 field pairs (32 sites), we measured relative differences in bat species richness and abundance using acoustic bat recorders, and bat prey availability using black-light traps. We predicted that organic soybean fields would have greater bat species richness, bat abundance and bat prey abundance than conventional soybean fields due to the prohibition of synthetic pesticides and longer more diverse crop rotations in organic fields, both of which should benefit bat insect prey. We found that organic soybean fields had higher bat species richness, bat abundance and bat prey abundance than conventional fields, after controlling for the effect of differences in soybean height between conventional and organic fields. Our results suggest that the management practices used at organic farms benefit bats at least in part by providing greater bat prey availability.","10.1016/j.biocon.2018.06.021","CE","CE_7188",235,0.239311963201125,0.10278657979184,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

As an alternative to conventional farming, organic management is considered a way to mitigate some of the negative impacts on biodiversity in agricultural landscapes; however, their benefits for bats are not very conclusive. We investigated the hypothesis that organic farming benefits bats in vineyards by improving conditions for foraging through increased availability of prey. We also hypothesized that bat activity would vary between edges and the interior of vineyards in response to prey availability that in turn would be influenced by agricultural management. Bat activity was quantified along edge and the interior of each vineyard type by using acoustic surveys. In addition, we sampled nocturnal flying insects at each site using light traps. Species richness and overall bat activity were significantly higher in organic than conventional vineyards, with organic edges concentrating the highest bat activity. Our results suggest negative effects of agricultural intensification on insectivorous bats. The high bat activity along edges compared to the interior of vineyards suggest that these structural features of the landscape are important components for bat populations in vineyards, and therefore should be considered within agricultural management in order to promote bat abundance and their role as pest suppressors.",NA,"CE","CE_7189",212,0.237972150029372,0.0878100983392068,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Previous studies suggest that one potential way to enhance biodiversity without taking land out of production is to increase the landscape heterogeneity of farmland by increasing the diversity of crop types in the landscape, and/or the complexity of the spatial pattern of the crop fields (e.g., by decreasing field sizes). Thus we hypothesize that farmland heterogeneity should also increase bat abundance and richness in agricultural landscapes. Here, we use data on bat activity and richness collected using acoustic surveys in rural eastern Ontario, Canada to test the predictions that there should be greater bat activity and greater species richness in agricultural landscapes with higher Shannon diversity of crops and smaller fields, when controlling for the effect of total crop cover. Bat activity increased with farmland heterogeneity, as predicted. Farmland heterogeneity was also positively related to species richness, although the relationship was not statistically supported. Positive effects of farmland heterogeneity on bats will be of interest to farmers and agricultural policy-makers, given the potential economic benefits of pest control by bats.","10.1016/j.agee.2017.11.001","CE","CE_7190",187,0.161618816272806,0.200941038086701,"200","neutral","neutral_200",1

Disturbances at caves (e.g., commercial development, recreation) limit their availability to bats, in some cases shifting use to abandoned mines. However, abandoned mines pose public safety hazards and often are gated to reduce risk to humans while maintaining access to bats. To date there is limited information on species-specific acceptance of gates at abandoned mines. We designed our research objectives to determine short-term (1 week) behavioral responses of bats to gating, including gate material and height above ground, mid-term (<1 yr) changes in bat use before and after gate installation, and long-term changes (=4 yrs) in use and factors influencing species presence. We used an in situ mock gate experiment, comparison of bat use before and after gating, and genetic identification of guano in gated mines for our short-, mid-, and long-term studies, respectively. In our short-term study, bats increased energetically demanding behaviors following gate installation. Although we detected no difference in responses to gate material or height, a less maneuverable bat species circled, collided, and landed more frequently on gates than did an agile species. In the mid-term study, activity remained stable or increased at 73% of mines after gating compared to before gating, although number of maternity colonies decreased. In the long-term study, elevation, portal area, number of mine levels, and entrances were more important than gates in predicting presence of 4 bat species, including 2 subterranean obligates. Species-specific responses to gates appeared based on morphology and vocalization characteristics. Responses to gates shifted from negative in our short-term study to positive in our long-term study. Gate age and mine characteristics were more important predictors of use for most species than gate design. Although the complexity of subterranean habitats makes them difficult to replicate and many factors may influence how bats use this habitat, gates designed for bats (bat-compatible) appear effective for many species. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21498","CE","CE_7191",330,0.235333065277443,0.180076682108901,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

However, increased human safety concerns have led to accelerated abandoned mine closure programs. To protect roosting sites in mines with significant bat activity, bat-compatible gates are installed that allow continued access to mine workings. Aside from ensuring public safety, these gates provide protection from disturbance to roosting bats. We evaluated the effects of gating on bat flight behavior at maternity colonies in 2 previously gated (control) and 2 ungated (treatment) mines that were gated during this study. We used an infrared video camera to record bat flight behavior at the entrances to each of the 4 study mines for 2 consecutive mornings and a single night each month during the warm season. Entrance (03:00-06:00) and emergence (21:00-24:00) surveys comprised 3 consecutive hours. Overall circling activity increased more than 6-fold at openings of treatment mines following gating (P < 0.001). Crowding during emergence was significantly higher (P = 0.023) in newly gated mines than in previously gated mines. Gates affect subadults during the initial-volancy periods, as detected through collisions with the gates. Increased activity of bats and collisions with the gate, which result in bats falling to the ground at mine openings, may amplify vulnerability to predators and increase energetic demands.","10.3398/064.074.0407","CE","CE_7192",220,0.217061180714129,0.180452132053954,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

However, identifying a target to reach can be challenging as ecological issues can be numerous and post-exploitation state can differ from the original due to ecosystems removal or topography alterations caused by exploitation. Here, we assess the restoration potential of gravel-sand pits for Bats, a targeted group for conservation, using data from 21 gravel-sand pits monitored by the ROSELIERE scheme and we selected external data from 76 sites of the French Bat Monitoring. We analysed the relative attractiveness of 17 habitats and 5 gravel-sand pit operating statuses (before quarrying, during quarrying, rehabilitation post-quarrying younger than 5 years, rehabilitation post-quarrying between 5 and 10 years and, finally, rehabilitation post-quarrying older than 10 years). We paid close attention to comparison between gravel-sand pits states and aquatic habitats, because the restoration process in the gravel-sand pits studied often leads to bodies of water and these habitats are among the most favorable for numerous bats species. In addition, we focus our comparisons on arable land because new gravel-sand pit settlements are usually planned on such agricultural land and furthermore because it represents the major land-use pressure for bats. We found that bat activity in gravel-sand pit displays a range comparable to what is observed in numerous habitats, though it does appear both slightly lower than in bodies of water and greater than arable land. Bat activity appears increasing during the gravel-sand pit life's cycle. However, only quarries which had been rehabilitated for more than 10 years exhibited significantly greater bat activity than observed in the four other gravel-sand pit states. Our results, highlight the length of time required to detect obvious changes in the attractiveness of site being rehabilitated and the magnitude of the gap between the current state and the target (i.e. aquatic habitat). Such results should be take into account when sizing offsetting measures of quarries.","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.11.013","CE","CE_7201",344,0.351215234524177,0.164335892417284,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Bat hunting, selling and consumption are widely distributed across regional and ethnic lines, with hotspots in certain localities, while butchering is predominantly done by women and active hunters. Interviewees held little belief of disease risk from bats, saw no ecological value in fruit bats and associated the consumption of bats with specific tribes.

We used acoustic recording of bat echolocation call sequences to examine bat activity (relative use of an area for foraging) in hardwood forest stands subject to 4 prescribed fire and residual basal area treatments (spring prescribed fire with woodland [SpW] and savanna [SpS] residual basal areas, and fall prescribed fire with woodland [FaW] and savanna [FaS]) basal areas, as well as untreated controls, during summer of 2013 and 2014. When possible, we classified recorded echolocation call sequences to species using automated identification software (Sonobat  3.1.4, SonoBat  Inc., Arcata, California). To minimize errors in species classification of recorded bat passes, we combined similar species in groups based on call characteristics prior to conducting analyses. Total bat activity (P= 0.001), as well as LABO/NYHU (eastern red bat [.

Our results suggest these treatments reduce clutter (physical obstructions to flight and foraging including foliage, branches, and stems), leading to improved foraging conditions for bats, particularly larger bodied species with lower call frequencies that are adapted to fly and forage in open conditions. We found no evidence nocturnal flying insect prey abundance or biomass influenced activity of bats in treatment stands, indicating clutter is more important than prey availability in determining habitat use by bats in this system.

We monitored bat activity immediately post-harvest, three growing seasons post-harvest, and after application of prescribed fire to harvested stands before the fourth growing season. Total bat activity levels were higher in thinned and thinned and burned treatments than in unthinned controls in all years, but did not differ between harvest treatment levels immediately post-harvest, three growing seasons post-harvest, or between harvest treatment levels within years. Total bat activity post-prescribed fire changed only in the 50% retention harvest treatment blocks, wherein activity decreased. Activity levels of big brown (.

Perimyotis subflavus) collectively did not differ among treatment blocks post-fire, but were greater in harvested treatment blocks than controls three growing seasons post-harvest. Community composition was strongly related to vegetation volume, with eastern red bats and Myotis and tri-colored bats displaying positive relationships with clutter in low height strata, and big brown bats displaying a negative relationship with clutter in all height strata. The positive relationship between eastern red and Myotis and tri-colored bats and clutter in low height strata may explain why activity levels of these species decreased post-prescribed fire. Our study suggests that the harvesting component of oak forest regeneration treatments may benefit bats for several years, and that while bat activity levels may decline post-prescribed fire, overall activity levels are nonetheless greater than in unthinned areas.","10.1016/j.foreco.2015.10.010","CE","CE_7206",315,0.217213262895727,0.103010011830362,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Large areas of river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) forests have declined in ecological condition. Thinning has been promoted as a tool to reduce competition in dense, young stands of E. camaldulensis regrowth, yet responses of forest structure and fauna to large-scale thinning are largely unclear. Aims To establish a before-after-control-impact experiment to assess responses of forest structure and fauna to large-scale (compartment-level; ~440 ha) silvicultural thinning. Methods We measured immediate (<2 yrs) responses of forest structural components (living, dead and hollow-bearing stem densities, coarse woody debris (CWD) density and volumes and ground cover) and components of biodiversity (bats, birds, volant insects and non-volant mammals) before and after thinning within five control and three impact compartments. Key results Thinning reduced stem density by approximately two-thirds and was associated with a substantial increase in activity and richness of bats and a change in bat species composition. There was no change in richness for birds and non-volant mammals, nor insect biomass in relation to thinning. However, thinning affected composition of non-volant mammals, with the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) less active post-thinning at impact plots relative to control plots. Thinning reduced the density of dead stems, though these were predominantly small (~13 cm diameter at breast height over bark, or dbhob) and mostly lacked hollows. Hollow-bearing tree density was not affected by thinning. Although thinning increased CWD densities, volume of CWD did not change, indicating that thinning contributed small-sized CWD. Thinning did not affect densities of hollow- and fissure-bearing CWD or ground cover, which was low (<7%) in control and impact plots. There were no other negative effects on biodiversity detected. Conclusions Short-term fauna responses to thinning were generally neutral or positive. Implications Ongoing monitoring is required to detect long-term changes that may result from colonisation or altered breeding success after thinning.

We investigated for the first time how differently grained forest management systems affect the biodiversity of multiple above- and below-ground taxa across spatial scales. We sampled 15 taxa of animals, plants, fungi and bacteria within the largest contiguous beech forest landscape of Germany and classified them into functional groups. Selected forest stands have been managed for more than a century at different spatial grains. The EA (coarse-grained management) and UEA (fine-grained) forests are comparable in spatial arrangement, climate and soil conditions. These were compared to forests of a nearby national park that have been unmanaged for at least 20 years. We used diversity accumulation curves to compare -diversity for Hill numbers 0D (species richness), 1D (Shannon diversity) and 2D (Simpson diversity) between the management systems. Beta diversity was quantified as multiple-site dissimilarity. Gamma diversity was higher in EA than in UEA forests for at least one of the three Hill numbers for six taxa (up to 77%), while eight showed no difference. Only bacteria showed the opposite pattern. Higher -diversity in EA forests was also found for forest specialists and saproxylic beetles. Between-stand ß-diversity was higher in EA than in UEA forests for one-third (all species) and half (forest specialists) of all taxa, driven by environmental heterogeneity between age-classes, while a-diversity showed no directional response across taxa or for forest specialists. Synthesis and applications. Comparing EA and uneven-aged forest management in Central European beech forests, our results show that a mosaic of different age-classes is more important for regional biodiversity than high within-stand heterogeneity. We suggest reconsidering the current trend of replacing even-aged management in temperate forests. Instead, the variability of stages and stand structures should be increased to promote landscape-scale biodiversity.","10.1111/1365-2664.12950","CE","CE_7208",337,0.19781724651339,0.14606668726208,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
7209,2018,"Ecological outcomes for multiple taxa from silvicultural thinning of regrowth forest","Forest Ecology and Management","Management of forest regrowth is a key issue globally, particularly where it occurs as high densities of small-sized stems and where there is little to no self-thinning. Thinning can reduce stem density to accelerate tree growth and potentially restore forest-structural complexity. Yet, in some forest types, it remains unclear how biodiversity responds to thinning, especially over longer periods. White cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla is geographically widespread in Australia and has history of silvicultural thinning in parts of its distribution. We used a chronosequence approach to assess the short- and longer-term responses of multiple taxa (bats, birds, invertebrates, reptiles, non-volant mammals, and plants) to thinning of C. glaucophylla in the dry Pilliga forests of New South Wales. We recorded data from a total of 227 taxa. The short ( 20 years) responses to thinning of C. glaucophylla regrowth were mostly positive or neutral for the taxa considered. Bat activity and diversity were comparable to levels in long-undisturbed reference forest, though this was influenced by time since thinning. Reptile diversity and abundance was positively associated with thinning at an intermediate time since thinning (820 years), with both metrics greater than unthinned regrowth and long-undisturbed reference forest. Bird diversity was greater in recent and old thinning treatments when compared to unthinned forest regrowth, although species composition was not affected by thinning. Though thinning did not affect volant invertebrate biomass, it was associated with a relatively more even distribution among size classes >8 years post-thinning, and a greater representation of beetles to overall insect biomass. The activity, diversity and composition of non-volant mammals did not differ among treatments, nor did understorey plant diversity or composition. Combining these multiple taxa into a composite biodiversity index demonstrated a 1622% increase with thinning relative to index values in long-undisturbed reference forests. Overall these results indicate that thinning has neutral to positive effects on biodiversity, but responses are species-specific and likely to be dependent on forest-type and the broader landscape of a site. Given unthinned forest represented habitat of similar value to thinned forest for some taxa, we recommend that that regrowth patches of varying size are retained across the landscape to provide a mosaic forest structure suitable for a diverse suite of flora and fauna.","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.05.026","CE","CE_7209",374,0.179009214431675,0.149931550360934,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
7210,2018,"Bat community responses to structural habitat complexity resulting from management practices within different land use types - a case study from north-eastern Germany","Acta Chiropterologica","In the present study we evaluated how management practices, structural habitat parameters and arthropod availability affect bat activity, species richness and species diversity (estimated by Shannon's diversity index H') in a cultural landscape composed by a mosaic of different habitats in Brandenburg (Germany). Over a study period of two years (2012-2013), a standardised acoustic monitoring was conducted on 12 sampling sites comprising different land use types in forests (pine, mixed and deciduous forest) and agricultural areas (arable land and grassland). The focus was on the effect of small-scale changes in structural habitat parameters resulting from management practices within one-and-the-same land use type. We applied a paired sampling design and compared two (forest) and three (agricultural areas) sampling sites (complexity categories) per land use type. An effect of structural complexity was tested using parametric and non-parametric analyses. Sampling sites differ in a complexity index derived from vegetation measurements related to: a) vertical vegetation structure (pine forests), b) tree species composition (mixed forests), c) tree age (deciduous forests), d) crop type (arable land), and e) management intensity (grassland). Within the pine and mixed forest, management practices leading to an increase in structural habitat complexity were associated with a significant increase in bat activity, species richness, and species diversity (H'). This effect is only partially explained by increased prey abundance. On grassland, increased bat abundance is associated with low-intensity management practices. This effect is explainable by an increase in arthropod abundance associated with structural complexity but no additional effect of structural complexity beyond that. On arable land, the difference in structural complexity among different crops (and not prey abundance) significantly affects bat communities. Our approach employed proxy measures of habitat quality to estimate which management practices within the study area theoretically result in suitable and available habitats to meet the requirements of local bat species. Thus, our findings have implications for forest and agricultural management. Even minor changes in silvicultural management (understory development in pine monocultures and increased percentage of deciduous trees in mixed forests) may lead to a significant increase in forest habitat quality for bats. The findings also stress the importance of extensive management practices in grassland, as well as structure-rich crops on arable land to achieve a more environmentally sustainable farmland management.","10.3161/15081109ACC2018.20.2.010","CE","CE_7210",377,0.367923650436592,0.362117050814533,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1
7211,2018,"Activity of an endangered bat increases immediately following prescribed fire","Journal of Wildlife Management","Spatiotemporal responses of bats to fire are not well understood. Fire can indirectly influence bat activity through changes to understory vegetation, insect prey availability, and roost tree abundance. High-flying bats may be less influenced by fire-induced changes to the understory because they forage above the forest canopy. Fire-dependent forests are prevalent across the range of the endemic Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus), a large, high-flying, and critically endangered species, yet effects of fire management on this species are completely unknown. To investigate short-term responses of these bats to fire, we conducted pre-post-treatment-control experiments in 4 prescribed burns during 2 seasons (dry, wet). For 12 nights pre-burn and 24 nights post-burn, we surveyed bat activity acoustically at 3 sites within each burn (treatment) and 3 adjacent sites (control). Using mixed-effects models to test the effect of treatment on bat activity, we found that bat activity significantly increased post-burn in treatment sites relative to control sites, with more pronounced effects during dry season burns. We also detected significantly more feeding buzzes (foraging activity) in treatment sites than control sites, and a negative trend over time in the burn effect size post-burn. We suggest that bats are attracted to increased availability of insect prey immediately following burns, particularly during the dry season when prey may be limited. Our results suggest that burns have short-term positive effects on Florida bonneted bats and that restoring fire to fire-dependent forests may improve foraging habitat for this species. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21481","CE","CE_7211",253,0.188882853816086,-0.119949326745742,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

In addition to installing light-emitting diode street lights, many local authorities are also dimming street lights. This might benefit light-averse bat species by creating dark refuges for these bats to forage and commute in human-dominated habitats. We conducted a field experiment to determine how light intensity affects the activity of the light-opportunistic Pipistrellus pipistrellus and light-averse bats in the genus Myotis. We used four lighting levels controlled under a central management system at existing street lights in a suburban environment (0, 25, 50 and 100% of the original output). Higher light intensities (50 and 100% of original output) increased the activity of light-opportunistic species but reduced the activity of light-averse bats. Compared to the unlit treatment, the 25% lighting level did not significantly affect either P. pipistrellus or Myotis spp. Our results suggest that it is possible to achieve a light intensity that provides both economic and ecological benefits by providing sufficient light for human requirements while not deterring light-averse bats.","10.1098/rsos.180205","CE","CE_7212",175,0.3788279081657,0.145605438700159,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

However, despite the known importance of conserving common and widespread biodiversity, criteria used to designate a Natura 2000 site are oriented toward rare and/or emblematic biodiversity. In this study, we took advantage of the fact that the management of Natura 2000 is just beginning to assess whether the five most common bat (Chiroptera) species and one genus in France exhibit a greater relative abundance within rather than outside Natura 2000 boundaries, and three bats communities index: total relative abundance, species richness, Community Habitat specialization index. We model the relative abundance of each taxa and indices using data from a nationwide volunteer-based acoustic survey. We found that three of the six taxa studied exhibit greater relative abundance within Natura 2000 sites (this increase is noteworthy for E. serotinus (× 2.1) and Myotis ssp. (× 3.6)). We also provide evidence that total relative abundance of bat activity and richness are globally higher in Natura 2000 sites (respectively + 24% and + 14%) and on average communities are more specialized within Natura 2000 sites. In addition, when the effect of Natura 2000 is adjusted to the main land use types, a significant positive effect of Natura 2000 remains for most metrics. The positive Natura 2000 effect appears relatively small compared to the main land use pressure: intensive agriculture and artificial light at night. However, Natura 2000 has a comparable sized effect as habitat widely recognized as having a positive impact on bats, such as streams.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.10.029","CE","CE_7214",236,0.258355052818482,0.336147147274904,"250","neutral","neutral_250",1

In the tropics, catching bats has been more commonly used as a survey method than acoustic recordings. In our study, acoustic methods based on recording echolocation calls detected greater bat activity and more species than mist-netting. However, some species were detected more frequently or exclusively by capture. Ideally, the two methods should be used together to compensate for the biases in each. Using combined capture and acoustic data, we found that protected forests, forest fragments, and shade coffee plantations hosted similar and diverse species assemblages, although some species were recorded more frequently in protected forests. Tea plantations contained very few species from the overall bat assemblage. In riparian habitats, a strip of forested habitat on the river bank improved the habitat for bats compared to rivers with tea planted up to each bank. Our results show that shade coffee plantations are better bat habitat than tea plantations in biodiversity hotspots. However, if tea is to be the dominant land use, forest fragments and riparian corridors can improve the landscape considerably for bats. We encourage coffee growers to retain traditional plantations with mature native trees, rather than reverting to sun grown coffee or coffee shaded by a few species of timber trees.","10.1002/ece3.3942","CE","CE_7215",231,0.270088797621312,0.182628373314402,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Artificial roost structures are increasingly being used in conservation efforts for at-risk bat species. To evaluate microhabitat differences in common artificial roost structures and determine if roost selection occurs based on structure type, we installed artificial roosts of three different styles (bat box, rocket box, and bark mimic) in six clusters. We compared size and measured temperature parameters (12 points/roost) while bats were excluded from one cluster. We simultaneously conducted census counts during the active season at five more clusters open to bats for 1-2 years. The rocket box style provided larger entrance area, surface area, and volume versus other roost types. Microclimate varied with roost design. More positions inside the bat box and rocket box stayed within critical temperature limits for bats (0-45°C)-i.e., were usable. The bark-mimic provided less usable space than the rocket box and, often, large proportions of the roost were > 45°C. The rocket box provided the widest temperature availability in a given hour (max range available 7°C) and was more stable than the bark mimic. A maternity colony of Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis) selected the rocket box style; four of five available rocket boxes became primary maternity roosts, with 2-210 bats emerging per night. Future work should aim to manipulate roost size, temperature availability, and temperature stability in isolation to identify which features drive roost microhabitat selection by bats. Comparative studies of artificial roosts account for some inherent irregularity in natural systems, allowing us to study the dynamics of roost microhabitats. We recommend season-long monitoring of microhabitat in novel artificial refuges and comparative studies of artificial and natural roosts, and urge managers to consider potential positive and negative effects when substituting artificial roosts for natural habitat.","10.1371/journal.pone.0205701","CE","CE_7217",307,0.308341584505336,0.162598098985718,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Urban wildlife corridors have been proposed as a potential mitigation tool to facilitate the passage of elephants through towns without causing conflict with urban communities. However, because such corridors are typically narrow and close to human development, wildlife (particularly large mammals) may be less likely to use them. We used remote-sensor camera traps and global positioning system collars to identify the movement patterns of African elephants Loxondonta africana through narrow, urban corridors in Botswana. The corridors were in three types of human-dominated land-use designations with varying levels of human activity: agricultural, industrial and open-space recreational land. We found that elephants used the corridors within all three land-use designations and we identified, using a model selection approach, that season, time of day and rainfall were important factors in determining the presence of elephants in the corridors. Elephants moved more slowly through the narrow corridors compared with their movement patterns through broader, wide-ranging corridors. Our results indicate that urban wildlife corridors are useful for facilitating elephants to pass through urban areas.","10.1017/S0030605315001246","CE","CE_7351",196,0.257001903902568,0.158360927095569,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
7352,2017,"First soft-release of a relocated puma in South America","Mammal Research","Pumas (Puma concolor) are the second largest Neotropical felid, widespread throughout of the Americas. In Brazil, the species is presently affected by habitat destruction and fragmentation, driven often by the increase of road density. As a result, individuals are often victims of collisions with vehicles, some of which survive and are taken to zoos and other institutions for treatment. Some animals recover fully and would be fit for reintroduction into the wild. However, few attempts have been made to adequately conduct and monitor these reintroductions throughout South and Central America. We here present data on a soft-release experiment with a young male puma which was hit by a vehicle in state of São Paulo, Brazil. After 16 months in a felid conservation center, the animal recovered from the wounds and was transferred to a pre-release fenced area. Diel activity differed between the two enclosures, with that in the latter being closer to what has been described for individuals in the wild (i.e., mainly nocturnal and crepuscular activity). Prior to release, the animal was equipped with a radio collar. Monitoring showed a preference for commercial forests (Pinus spp. and Eucalyptus spp.) and avoidance of pastures and secondary forests. Later, there was a shift towards primary forest. Four hundred and thirty-three days after its release, the animal was killed in another vehicle collision, 55 km from the first one. Although sample size is small and the study period short, our data on activity, habitat preferences, and movements showed that the released animal presented ecological patterns close to those described in wild animals. This suggests that the soft-release protocol used in this study worked, giving the animal another chance to survive in the highly altered anthropogenic landscapes of state of São Paulo, Brazil.","10.1007/s13364-016-0302-0","CE","CE_7352",293,0.205954643560207,0.0523801642199042,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Specific objectives were to 1) determine postrelease movement patterns of relocated black bears, and 2) estimate cumulative incidence and survival functions. Subadults did not move as far after translocation as adults and less frequently oriented toward the capture site (29% of subad vs. 51% of ad). No subadults returned to the vicinity of capture, whereas 33% of adults did. We used a cause-specific hazards model with a constant age effect across the cause-specific hazards to estimate annual survival rate for translocated adult bears (0.50, 95% credible interval CI = 0.36-0.65) and for subadult bears (0.28, 95% CI = 0.12-0.48). The annual probability of dying due to repeat conflict behavior was slightly lower (0.22 [95% CI = 0.13-0.33] and 0.32 [95% CI = 0.19-0.47]) for adults and subadults, respectively, compared with nonconflict mortalities (0.28 [95% CI = 0.17-0.40] and 0.40 [95% CI = 0.25-0.56]). Based on bears that were not involved in known repeat human-bear conflicts, translocation success was 0.64 (95% CI = 0.49-0.78) and 0.58 (95% CI = 0.42-0.73) for adults and subadults, respectively. Translocation of problem bears had mixed success relative to repeat nuisance activity in Colorado, but should remain a viable management option. Managers should make decisions on the appropriateness of translocation based on the characteristics of the bear, identification of an adequate release site, potential effect of the translocation on the release-site bear population, and other available options.","10.1002/wsb.526","CE","CE_7354",235,0.198613486018393,0.0174865728561311,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Use of underpasses by coyotes (Canis latrans) was higher in the control zone than in the impact zone, but there was no difference in use before and after construction. Small numbers of detections of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) at only a few underpasses precluded comparison between control and impact zones. However, a comparison of use before and after construction revealed that use of underpasses by mule deer was slightly higher post-construction. We cannot fully attribute increased detections post-construction to mitigative efforts, because other factors, such as availability of habitat, urbanization, or demography, also may have influenced use of underpasses along CA-71. Nonetheless, even with the expansion of the freeway and subsequent increase in volume of traffic, mitigative structures along CA-71 did allow for continued movement and, hence, connectivity across the roadway for large mammals.","10.1894/F04-TAL-51.1","CE","CE_7356",216,0.0574669431029179,0.0283160284347632,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

However, the number of managed species selected is relatively small and focused on large-bodied, charismatic mammals that are not necessarily under strong threat and not always good candidates for reintroduction into the wild. Two interrelated and more fundamental questions go unanswered: have the major breeding programs succeeded at the basic level of maintaining and expanding populations, and is there room to expand them? I used published counts of births and deaths from 1970 to 2011 to quantify rates of growth of 118 captive-bred mammalian populations. These rates did not vary with body mass, contrary to strong predictions made in the ecological literature. Most of the larger managed mammalian populations expanded consistently and very few programs failed. However, growth rates have declined dramatically. The decline was predicted by changes in the ratio of the number of individuals within programs to the number of mammal populations held in major zoos. Rates decreased as the ratio of individuals in programs to populations increased. In other words, most of the programs that could exist already do exist. It therefore appears that debates over the general need for captive-breeding programs and the best selection of species are moot. Only a concerted effort could create room to manage a substantially larger number of endangered mammals.","10.1111/cobi.12471","CE","CE_7357",236,0.0979131814299822,0.0417308424560339,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

7364,2013,"Carnivore conservation in practice: replicated management actions on a large spatial scale","Journal of Applied Ecology","More than a quarter of the world's carnivores are threatened, often due to multiple and complex causes. Considerable research efforts are devoted to resolving the mechanisms behind these threats in order to provide a basis for relevant conservation actions. However, even when the underlying mechanisms are known, specific actions aimed at direct support for carnivores are difficult to implement and evaluate at efficient spatial and temporal scales. We report on a 30-year inventory of the critically endangered Fennoscandian arctic fox Vulpes lagopus L., including yearly surveys of 600 fox dens covering 21 000 km2. These surveys showed that the population was close to extinction in 2000, with 40-60 adult animals left. However, the population subsequently showed a fourfold increase in size. During this time period, conservation actions through supplementary feeding and predator removal were implemented in several regions across Scandinavia, encompassing 79% of the area. To evaluate these actions, we examined the effect of supplemental winter feeding and red fox control applied at different intensities in 10 regions. A path analysis indicated that 47% of the explained variation in population productivity could be attributed to lemming abundance, whereas winter feeding had a 29% effect and red fox control a 20% effect. This confirms that arctic foxes are highly dependent on lemming population fluctuations but also shows that red foxes severely impact the viability of arctic foxes. This study also highlights the importance of implementing conservation actions on extensive spatial and temporal scales, with geographically dispersed actions to scientifically evaluate the effects. We note that population recovery was only seen in regions with a high intensity of management actions. Synthesis and applications. The present study demonstrates that carnivore population declines may be reversed through extensive actions that target specific threats. Fennoscandian arctic fox is still endangered, due to low population connectivity and expected climate impacts on the distribution and dynamics of lemmings and red foxes. Climate warming is expected to contribute to both more irregular lemming dynamics and red fox appearance in tundra areas; however, the effects of climate change can be mitigated through intensive management actions such as supplemental feeding and red fox control.

7365,2017,"Preliminary observations of dingo responses to assumed aversive stimuli","Pacific Conservation Biology","Occasionally, interactions between dingoes (Canis dingo) and people on Fraser Island result in serious injury, and, in one case, death. The risk to human safety from such interactions may be mitigated if people could carry a suitably defensive repellent, similar in principle to bear (Ursus spp.) repellent spray advocated in North America. In the first step towards searching for suitable stimuli that might be used as repellents with dingoes, we observed the responses of nine dingoes to three stimuli during interactions with a researcher on Fraser Island. Two treatment stimuli were assumed to be potentially aversive (an air horn blast and a water jet from a motorised water pistol), and one was considered unlikely to be aversive and therefore suitable as a control (a whistle being blown). Responses to the stimuli varied. All nine dingoes were initially presented with the whistle; however, only one adult male responded as if the whistle was aversive. Seven of the nine dingoes were later presented with a whistle and treatment stimuli together. None of the seven dingoes were repelled during any air horn treatment trials; however, six of seven dingoes (all juveniles) were repelled by the water pistol stimulus. Although a water pistol was effective at repelling young dingoes on many occasions, responses between individuals were inconsistent. Results from this pilot study suggest that a water pistol stimulus may offer some protection as a repellent to close approaches by young dingoes, particularly if enhanced with a mild irritant.","10.1071/PC17005","CE","CE_7365",244,0.162355345657703,-0.0955670488863154,"250","neutral","neutral_250",1
7367,2018,"Diversionary feeding can reduce red deer habitat selection pressure on vulnerable forest stands, but is not a panacea for red deer damage","Forest Ecology and Management","Diversionary feeding implies strategic food provisioning to wildlife to lure animals away from undesired areas, and is a common forest management practice throughout Europe and North America. Within forestry, diversionary feeding typically targets cervids, and aims to reduce browsing damage and bark-stripping in vulnerable forest stands (young and mid-aged forest stands). Because these stands are most vulnerable during winter, diversionary feeing is often restricted to that season. Despite being widely applied, clear evidence on the effectiveness of diversionary feeding of cervids is lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of diversionary winter feeding as a tool to lure away a large cervid, red deer (Cervus elaphus), from vulnerable forest stands. First, we hypothesized (H1) that diversionary feeding is among the most important factors explaining differences in red deer habitat selection between summer (i.e., no food supply at feeding stations) and winter (i.e., food supply ad libitum at feeding stations). Second, we hypothesized (H2) that diversionary feeding releases red deer habitat selection pressure in forest stands vulnerable for browsing or bark-stripping, and that this release decays with distance to the nearest feeding station. We tested our hypotheses using red deer relocation data (11 individuals & 3 years) and resource selection functions in an intensively managed Austrian forest. As expected, variation in red deer habitat selection between summer and winter was best explained by a different response to supplementary feeding stations between the seasons (H1). During winter, red deer strongly selected for areas close to feeding stations, whereas feeding stations did not strongly affect their habitat selection during summer. We found that diversionary feeding during winter released red deer habitat selection pressure on vulnerable forest stands, but limited to distances of about 1.3 to 1.5 km from the feeding station, this accounts for 39% of the study area (H2). Our results show that diversionary feeding can indeed be an effective tool to mediate habitat selection behavior and to lure cervids away from vulnerable forest stands. However, habitat selection is not necessarily a good proxy for damage, and whether or not diversionary feeding reduces forestry damage in the long-term remains unclear, as it can positively feed-back into survival, reproduction, and eventually population growth and densities. We suggest that forest managers also consider silvicultural measures, population control (i.e., hunting) or spatial planning as means to minimize red deer induced forestry damage.","10.1016/j.foreco.2017.10.050","CE","CE_7367",393,0.250406522410686,-0.0191261652719949,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1
7370,2011,"Translocation as a tool for mitigating conflict with leopards in human-dominated landscapes of India","Conservation Biology","We examined the efficacy of a translocation program in which large numbers of leopards (Panthera pardus fusca) were trapped in human-dominated landscapes where livestock attacks were common and human attacks rare and released into adjoining forested areas in an attempt to reduce leopard presence and mitigate conflicts at the capture site. In the year starting in February of 2001, 29 leopards were captured in the human-dominated rural landscape of the Junnar region (4275 km2, 185 people/km2), Maharashtra, India, and released an average of 39.5 km away in adjoining forests. Eleven leopards were also relocated to the same forests from other districts. Prior to the large-scale translocation program, an average of four leopard attacks on humans occurred each year between 1993 and 2001. After the translocation program was initiated, the average increased substantially to 17 attacks. Linear and logistic models showed that attack frequency increased in Junnar following nearby releases of leopards and decreased when leopards were removed for releases far away; that attacks became more lethal when the number of leopards introduced from other districts increased; and that attacks were most likely to occur in the regions where the largest number of leopards had been introduced from other areas. These results suggest that leopards did not stay at the release sites and that translocation induced attacks on people. Potential explanations for these results include increased aggression induced by stress of the translocation process, movement through unfamiliar human-dominated landscapes following release, and loss of fear of humans due to familiarity with humans acquired during captivity. Our results show that reactive solutions to attacks on humans by leopards, such as translocation, could in fact increase human-leopard conflict. Measures to reduce human-carnivore conflicts may include more effective compensation procedures to pay livestock owners for the loss of animals to predation by carnivores, providing better methods of protection for livestock, and encouraging greater social acceptance of the presence of carnivores in human-dominated landscapes. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01599.x","CE","CE_7370",323,0.317425815655838,0.12019051180483,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

However, very little is known about their population status or ecology. We used camera traps to estimate the population size and waterhole use patterns of striped hyenas visiting artificial waterholes in the Dana Biosphere Reserve, Jordan. The population size of hyenas at waterholes was estimated, using capture-recapture (identified from unique stripe patterns) method, to be nine animals in 2010 and 10 animals in 2012. Waterhole visits occurred almost entirely at night, with monthly visitation rates increasing in the hotter summer months and as the duration from the last rainfall increased.

7375,2013,"No trespassing: using a biofence to manipulate wolf movements","Wildlife Research","Context Conserving large carnivores can be challenging because of conflicts with human land use and competition with humans for resources. Predation on domestic stock can have negative economic impacts particularly for owners of small herds, and tools for minimising carnivore depredation of livestock are needed. Canids use scent marking to establish territories and avoid intraspecific conflict. Exploiting scent-marking behaviour may provide a means for manipulating canid movements. Aims We hypothesised that human-deployed scent marks (i.e. 'biofence') could be used to manipulate the movements of grey wolves (Canis lupus) in Idaho, USA. Methods We deployed 65km of biofence within three wolf-pack territories during summer 2010 and 2011 and used location data from satellite-collared wolves and sign surveys to assess the effectiveness of biofencing. Key results Location data provided by satellite-collared wolves and sign surveys in 2010 showed little to no trespass of the biofence, even though the excluded areas were used by the packs in previous summers. We also opportunistically deployed a biofence in between a rendezvous site of a resident pack and a nearby sheep grazing allotment; the pack was not implicated in any depredations in summer 2010, even though they had killed sheep every year since 2006. Location data provided by satellite-collared wolves in summer 2011 showed that wolves did trespass biofences. Conclusions Biofencing effectively manipulated the movements of wolves in the first year of our study, but not the second. Implications Our work suggests that biofencing may be most limited by the apparent necessity to maintain a continuous presence once the biofence is established. The inherent labour and costs associated with such efforts may limit the usefulness of biofencing. Our work can be improved on through further testing that maintains biofencing over a longer timeframe (>3 months), samples several animals per treatment pack, and uses a treatment and control design.© CSIRO 2013.","10.1071/WR12176","CE","CE_7375",303,0.201270741239598,-0.113350468351492,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

The WPS has three sections and includes 19 underpasses, fences along two sections, and stock guards at the beginning and end of each section. Monitoring was carried out from 1995 to 2002. The changes in the roadkill rate (number of individuals/km/day) and the community of vertebrates affected by the WPS were analyzed. A total of 32 taxonomic units (TUs) were identified. Mammalia was the class with the highest richness of TUs affected before (S=12) and after (S=13) the installation of the WPS. For both pre- and post-WPS stages combined, mammals had the most roadkilled individuals (92.2%), followed by reptiles (5.2%). The highest roadkill rates were observed in winter 1995 (0.38. ±0.291. ind./km/day), winter 1998 (0.20. ±0.130. ind./km/day), and autumn 2002 (0.17. ±0.123. ind./km/day).

We investigated the use of den trees and the availability of hollow-bearing trees near Mackay in the tropical north of the squirrel glider range where information was deficient. Mean den tree size (41.1±2.9cm (s.e.), diameter at breast height (dbh)) was significantly larger than that of available trees (27.5±0.9cm). Dead trees (stags) comprised 52% of 27 dens but comprised only 12% of available trees. This likely reflects the greater frequency of hollows in dead trees compared with other trees. Surveys found that 59% of 720 available trees contained hollows. A much lower percentage of trees in the 10-30-cm dbh size class were hollow-bearing (22%) compared with trees 30cm (77%), and we view these smaller trees as those providing future den trees. Their density varied from 17 to 95ha-1 among sites, which suggests that most sites have an adequate supply of future hollows. We installed 56 nest boxes to determine use by squirrel gliders. Only 20% were used after 3 years, but use was not influenced by the availability of tree hollows.

Attempts to reintroduce native mammals are often unsuccessful due to a suboptimal number of founders being used, high rates of predation and a lack of knowledge of the reintroduction biology for the species concerned. We trialled predator swamping and supplementary feeding in an attempt to offset predation and improve reintroduction success for the burrowing bettong (Bettongia lesueur) in arid South Australia. We compared population longevity of a large release group (1266 animals) with five releases of smaller groups (~50 animals at each). We compared release sites with (n=5) and without (n=1) supplementary food to determine whether site fidelity, body condition and reproduction were affected, and whether these traits aided population establishment. Predator swamping did not facilitate reintroduction success, with no bettongs detected more than 122 days after release. While supplementary food increased site fidelity and persistence at release sites, bettongs failed to establish successfully at any site. Neither predator swamping nor supplementary feeding enhanced reintroduction success at our sites but results suggested that supplementary feeding should be explored as an aid to reintroduction success for Australian mammals.","10.1071/AM15020","CE","CE_7389",192,0.291934161002434,0.0419150118007519,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Such an investment requires a quantitative monitoring approach that allows for the effectiveness of the expenditure to be determined. By combining criminological deterrence theory and spatially explicit field-ranger patrol monitoring, we develop a framework to measure the presence of field-rangers in the landscape. We test this framework empirically by comparing the presence of field-rangers in the landscape against the presence around 40 rhino poaching incidents. We empirically demonstrate that the analysed field ranger human resources and their deployment in a well-staffed protected area in Africa did not deter rhino poachers.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.03.017","CE","CE_7390",147,0.2479891176894,0.0674638371216396,"150","neutral","neutral_150",0

To minimize risks, introductions should be conducted following the International Union for Conservation of Nature's guidelines and should include an initial assessment and a follow-up. In 1948, to reduce the predation pressure on Pyrenean chamois Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica by golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos, the alpine marmot Marmota marmota was introduced to the Pyrenees in Western Europe. In successive introductions, about 500 marmots were released, but the fate of the released animals and their impacts on the environment remain largely unstudied. The aim of this study was to assess the success of the introduction of the alpine marmot into the Pyrenees, 60 years after the initial release, and the potential impacts of this species on Pyrenean ecosystems. We reviewed what is known about the marmot populations introduced to the Pyrenees and other populations within their native range in the Alps, particularly in terms of population structure and dynamics, habitat use and potential environmental impacts. The alpine marmot is widely distributed and, apparently, well established in the Pyrenees. Population structure and demographic parameters are similar within and outside the historical distribution range of the species, and habitat suitability is one of the main reasons for the species' success in the Pyrenees. Few researchers have investigated the impacts of alpine marmots in the Pyrenees; thus, those impacts have to be inferred from those observed in the species' native range or in other species of marmot. Introduced alpine marmots are likely to impact on Pyrenean grasslands through grazing and burrowing, have the potential to alter Pyrenean food webs and could act as vectors of parasites and disease. Although the introduction of the alpine marmot in the Pyrenees appears to have been successful, more needs to be known about the effects of the established populations on the environment before informed management actions can be taken in the Pyrenees. © 2012 The Authors.

Evaluation of education and enforcement as management tools for human-wildlife conflicts","PLoS ONE","Evidence-based decision-making is critical for implementing conservation actions, especially for human-wildlife conflicts, which have been increasing worldwide. Conservation practitioners recognize that long-term solutions should include altering human behaviors, and public education and enforcement of wildlife-related laws are two management actions frequently implemented, but with little empirical evidence evaluating their success. We used a system where human-black bear conflicts were common, to experimentally test the efficacy of education and enforcement in altering human behavior to better secure attractants (garbage) from bears. We conducted 3 experiments in Aspen CO, USA to evaluate: 1) on-site education in communal dwellings and construction sites, 2) Bear Aware educational campaign in residential neighborhoods, and 3) elevated law enforcement at two levels in the core business area of Aspen. We measured human behaviors as the response including: violation of local wildlife ordinances, garbage availability to bears, and change in use of bear-resistance refuse containers. As implemented, we found little support for education, or enforcement in the form of daily patrolling in changing human behavior, but found more support for proactive enforcement, i.e., dispensing warning notices. More broadly we demonstrated the value of gathering evidence before and after implementing conservation actions, and the dangers of measuring responses in the absence of ecological knowledge. We recommend development of more effective educational methods, application of proactive enforcement, and continued evaluation of tools by directly measuring change in human behavior. We provide empirical evidence adding to the conservation managers' toolbox, informing policy makers, and promoting solutions to human-wildlife conflicts.","10.1371/journal.pone.0015681","CE","CE_7395",254,0.346404263266356,0.262472600327376,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
7396,2016,"The effect of pre-release captivity on post-release performance in reintroduced eastern bettongs <i>Bettongia gaimardi</i>","Oryx","Reintroductions are used to re-establish populations of species within their indigenous range, but their outcomes are variable. A key decision when developing a reintroduction strategy is whether to include a temporary period of confinement prior to release. Pre-release confinement is primarily used for the purpose of quarantine or as a delayed-release tactic to influence the performance or behaviour of founders post-release. A common difference between these approaches is that quarantine tends to be conducted in ex situ captivity, whereas delayed releases tend to involve in situ confinement at the release site. Although these practices are commonly viewed independently, it may be possible for a single confinement period to be used for both purposes. We tested whether temporarily holding wild eastern bettongs Bettongia gaimardi in ex situ captivity for 95-345 days prior to release (delayed release) influenced their body mass, pouch occupancy or survival during the first 1.5 years post-release, compared to founders released without confinement (immediate release). Our results suggest that exposing founders to captivity did not alter their body mass or performance post-release, despite being heavier and having fewer pouch young when released. We conclude that, for this species, ex situ captivity does not represent a tactical opportunity to improve post-release performance but can be used for quarantine without affecting the probability of establishment.","10.1017/S0030605315000496","CE","CE_7396",220,0.270575962985522,-0.1116381691104,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

During 2008-2013 the scheme spent a mean of USD 100,000 per year, and although livestock losses remained constant the killing of lions decreased significantly. The percentage of claims where part of the compensation was withheld as a penalty for negligent husbandry practices decreased significantly over time but remained high; poor herding in particular remains a problem. We weigh our results against arguments found in a literature survey; our findings support the negative arguments of moral hazard (i.e. the risk that compensation reduces the incentive to prevent damage) and post-project collapse. Despite these weaknesses the compensation scheme was effective, affordable and sustainable.

As a result, management agencies lack efficacy data on post-release success rates and are often reluctant to encourage increased use of this technique. We evaluated the potential management and conservation implications of releasing captive-reared bears by documenting post-release survival, cause-specific mortality, human conflict activity, movements, and reproduction for 550 American black, brown and Asiatic black bears reared in 12 captive-rearing programs around the world. Survival rates in these programs ranged from 0.50 to 1.00 and were similar among the 3 species. The primary causes of mortality were sport hunting and road kills for American black bears, intra-specific predation and illegal kills for brown bears, and natural mortalities and illegal kills for Asiatic black bears. Although American and Asiatic black bears were involved in conflicts post-release, the majority of released bears (94%) were not documented in conflict situations. Movement patterns of captive-reared American black and brown bears showed no homing tendencies toward their rearing facility. Twenty captive-reared bears produced 21 litters. Our analyses reduce many of the uncertainties surrounding the fate of bears released as yearlings and provide evidence that releasing captive-reared bears is a defensible management alternative.","10.1002/jwmg.941","CE","CE_7400",223,0.323319416536117,-0.0690555931745024,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

This encroachment typically occurs at the expense of browse species that are preferred by mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Wildlife managers often treat habitat management as a tool to bolster mule deer populations, but documented changes in deer vital rates in response to habitat manipulations are lacking. We evaluated the effects of different levels of habitat improvement on pinyon pine-Utah juniper winter ranges in Colorado on mule deer overwinter survival. Mule deer fawns that overwintered on areas that received both a traditional mechanical treatment as well as follow-up chemical treatments experienced increased survival (S=0.768, SE=0.0851) over fawns on winter range that had only received traditional mechanical treatments or no habitat treatments (S=0.675, SE=0.112). When treatment intensity was partitioned into 3 levels: no treatment, traditional mechanical treatments, and advanced treatments comprised of both mechanical and chemical treatments, mule deer fawns inhabiting winter range subjected to advanced treatments experienced higher survival (S=0.768, SE=0.0849) than fawns on units that experienced only traditional mechanical treatments (S=0.687, SE=0.108), which in turn experienced higher survival than fawns in areas that had received no habitat treatments (S=0.669, SE=0.113). Our study provides evidence that habitat management on winter ranges can positively influence a key vital rate for mule deer in pinyon pine-Utah juniper ecosystems.

Improvements in survival rates of released ferrets have resulted from experience in quasi-natural environments during their rearing. Reestablishment of a self-sustaining wild population by 1999 provided the 1st opportunity to initiate new populations by translocating wild-born individuals. Using radiotelemetry, we compared behaviors and survival of 18 translocated wild-born ferrets and 18 pen-experienced captive-born ferrets after their release into a prairie dog colony not occupied previously by ferrets. Translocated wild-born ferrets moved significantly less and had significantly higher short-term survival rates than their captive-born counterparts. Using markrecapture methods, we also assessed potential impacts to the established donor population of removing 37% of its estimated annual production of kits. Annual survival rates for 30 ferret kits remaining at the donor subcomplex were higher than rates for 54 ferret kits at the control subcomplex (unmanipulated) for males (+82%) and females (+32%). Minimum survival of translocated kits did not differ significantly from survival of those at the control subcomplex.

7421,2011,"Mortality of Siberian polecats and black-footed ferrets released onto prairie dog colonies","Journal of Mammalogy","Black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) likely were extirpated from the wild in 19851986, and their repatriation depends on captive breeding and reintroduction. Postrelease survival of animals can be affected by behavioral changes induced by captivity. We released neutered Siberian polecats (M. eversmanii), close relatives of ferrets, in 19891990 on black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies in Colorado and Wyoming initially to test rearing and reintroduction techniques. Captive-born polecats were reared in cages or cages plus outdoor pens, released from elevated cages or into burrows, and supplementally fed or not fed. We also translocated wild-born polecats from China in 1990 and released captive-born, cage-reared black-footed ferrets in 1991, the 1st such reintroduction of black-footed ferrets. We documented mortality for 55 of 92 radiotagged animals in these studies, mostly due to predation (46 cases). Coyotes (Canis latrans) killed 31 ferrets and polecats. Supplementally fed polecats survived longer than nonprovisioned polecats. With a model based on deaths per distance moved, survival was highest for wild-born polecats, followed by pen-experienced, then cage-reared groups. Indexes of abundance (from spotlight surveys) for several predators were correlated with mortality rates of polecats and ferrets due to those predators. Released black-footed ferrets had lower survival rates than their ancestral population in Wyoming, and lower survival than wild-born and translocated polecats, emphasizing the influence of captivity. Captive-born polecats lost body mass more rapidly postrelease than did captive-born ferrets. Differences in hunting efficiency and prey selection provide further evidence that these polecats and ferrets are not ecological equivalents in the strict sense. © 2011 American Society of Mammalogists.","10.1644/10-MAMM-S-115.1","CE","CE_7421",262,0.215089303998905,-0.0762290354754674,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
7428,2015,"Post-release survival of captive-reared Allegheny woodrats","Animal Conservation","Captive breeding to augment wild animal populations is an important tool in the recovery of imperiled species, but low post-release survival and substantial program expenses require methodologies that maximize utility. We evaluated post-release survival of captive-reared Allegheny woodrats (Neotoma magister) introduced into a declining metapopulation in southern Indiana. We hard-released 16 captive-reared woodrats in 2011 and soft-released 14 woodrats in 2012, while monitoring parallel samples of 16 and 17 wild-born individuals in each year, respectively. We obtained Kaplan-Meier estimates of survivorship for both groups and used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the association between survival and rearing environment (wild or captive), release strategy, sex, body condition and age at release. We quantified movement patterns and related the results of survival models to behavioral tendencies. Survivorship of wild-born individuals was consistently higher than captive-reared individuals. Patterns of survival were best explained by rearing environment and its interaction with time, although disparities in survival between wild-born and captive-reared animals decreased over time. Higher mortality among captive-reared individuals may have been due to more exploratory behavior, as captive-reared woodrats used more dens and traveled farther among successive relocations than wild-born conspecifics. Soft-released individuals had higher initial survival rates and tended to choose dens similar to those of wild individuals, providing evidence that this strategy eased the transition to a wild environment. We recommend future programs use soft-release techniques but also explore other pre-release preparatory strategies such as anti-predator conditioning and environmental enrichment to increase survival.","10.1111/acv.12158","CE","CE_7428",256,0.312066588011029,0.125429638850029,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
7429,2011,"Influence of post-harvest silviculture on understory vegetation: Implications for forage in a multi-ungulate system","Forest Ecology and Management","Natural disturbance emulation has emerged as a key management approach to maintaining biodiversity in logged boreal forests. Forest managers' success in emulating understory forest ecosystem functions, e.g., for the provision of habitat even for large mammals, has not been tested due, in many cases, to incomplete records of silviculture. We examined regenerating areas of previously conifer-dominated forests in northwestern Ontario, Canada, 10 and 30. years after logging and 10 and 30. years after fire to test if understory development and moose (Alces alces) forage abundance differed between the two disturbance types and artificial or natural regeneration approaches. In addition, we counted moose pellet groups as a measure of moose use of the region. Specific treatments included: (1) naturally regenerating, fire-origin forests, (2) post-harvest, regenerating forests with natural establishment of trees, and (3) post-harvest, regenerating forests with mechanical or chemical site preparation and planting and/or herbicide spraying. We hypothesized that the understory in post-harvest stands would support higher forage availability for moose compared to similarly-aged, fire-origin stands. Abundance of hardwoods, shrubs, and herbaceous plants was greater in naturally-regenerated post-harvest stands than in fire-origin and artificially regenerated post-harvest stands at both 10 and 30. years post-disturbance. However, post-harvest, naturally regenerating stands were not significantly associated with higher moose use, rather evidence of moose use increased as a function of the amount of naturally regenerating logged forest in the surrounding landscape. This study suggests that, relative to fire, the intensity of post-harvest silviculture influences habitat suitability for moose. The effect likely cascades to other ungulates, such as woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), and vegetation management needs to be considered at scales greater than the stand level in order to achieve habitat management for large mammals. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.foreco.2011.07.022","CE","CE_7429",292,0.234210865999648,0.155479449719643,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

7432,2017,"Demography of an increasing caribou herd with restricted wolf control","Journal of Wildlife Management","Understanding the limiting factors of a prey population is important before and during predator control programs, and optimal intensive management of an increasing prey population requires formal recognition of a sustainable population size. The migratory Fortymile caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herd in Alaska reached a low of approximately 6,000 caribou during 19731975. To regain peak numbers of approximately 50,000 caribou estimated in the 1960s, stakeholder groups gained approval for conservative harvest rates (19732013) and periods of restricted nonlethal (19982004) and lethal wolf (Canis lupus) control (20052013). We studied demography of the herd using radio-telemetry during 19902014, when herd size increased from about 22,000 to 52,000 caribou. Parturition rates in the early 1990s were among the highest reported, but parturition rates of primiparous females subsequently declined to a level indicating resource-limitation as caribou numbers approached and then exceeded 50,000. This and companion studies documented several other cautionary signals to an eventual decline, including declining October calf weights, early summer movement off the alpine and subalpine tundra to lower elevation sprucemoss taiga, relatively high caribou densities, a nearly 40-year history of increasing caribou numbers, and a return to previous peak numbers. We studied mortality of calves and older females during the 4 years before wolf control and the first 5 years of nonlethal wolf control. During those 9 years, annual mortality rates averaged 54% for calves and 9% for adult females. We detected no convincing support for decreased wolf predation during nonlethal control. We also detected no support for increased caribou survival during nonlethal or lethal wolf control. Based on counts of caribou during summer aggregations using a total search photocensus technique, rate of herd increase ( r) was negligible ( r = 1.00) during 19901995, highest during the 3 years immediately before nonlethal wolf control ( r = 1.11, 19951998), moderate during nonlethal wolf control ( r = 1.07, 19982003), and low during the period that included the first 5 years of lethal wolf control ( r = 1.02, 20032010). We combined observed cause of death with the 9 annual modeled starting populations (all newborn calves and adults) and estimated that wolves killed 1015% of the populations annually, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) killed 47%, other predators killed 24%, nonpredation factors killed 12%, and hunters killed =2%. Wolves killed 59% of the annual populations as calves and 56% as adults. In retrospect, nonlethal wolf control efforts were too localized to decrease wolf numbers (e.g., adjacent untreated wolf packs reached max. mean numbers). Lethal wolf control efforts had only seasonal and localized effects on wolf numbers. It is important that stakeholders focus on describing a preferred, sustainable herd size, or nutritional status and proceed toward managing this increasing herd in a sustainable manner because, when ungulates overshoot carrying capacity, the effects of high density, adverse weather, and increased predation can have synergistic negative effects on prey numbers and long-lasting negative effects on sustainable yields, contrary to the intended purpose of the wolf control programs. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21209","CE","CE_7432",456,0.280994237123096,-0.106938728163598,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Macropods (mostly kangaroos and wallabies) are a diverse and widespread taxon in Australia that has been significantly affected by the presence of roads in various ways. We reviewed the available literature on macropods and roads, assessing 60 scientific journal articles, reports and theses. Studies on road mortalities were the most prevalent (n=29, with 12 on macropods only), revealing both spatial and temporal patterns in occurrence. Behavioural studies in relation to the road environment are limited (n=2) yet could help our understanding of patterns of road-kill and other impacts. Some macropod populations are critically affected by the presence of roads (e.g. brush-tailed rock-wallaby, Petrogale penicillata) due to either proportionately high road mortalities and/or population fragmentation, and may face continued decline unless effective road-mitigation measures are implemented. Investigations of various types of road mitigation focussed on wildlife-exclusion fencing and road crossing structures as the most effective option, although the high cost of these measures appears to limit their implementation.

Little research has focused on management options to deal with this confl ict. We better defi ne lethal and nonlethal management strategies associated with proactive and reactive management of coyotes with an emphasis on management of problem individuals. We then provide data from research in the Denver Metropolitan Area (DMA), Colorado, USA that focused on reactive lethal removal of problem coyotes and reactive nonlethal hazing (i.e., community-level hazing, a commonly recommended strategy that we better defi ne). The primary lethal management strategy being used in the DMA is to remove problem coyotes only when severe confl ict (primarily threats to people) occurs. From 2009-2014, there were 27 removal events (4.5/ year) with the average number of coyotes removed per event being 2.1 (range 1-11) and the average number of coyotes removed per year being 9.3. The estimated percentage of coyotes removed per year from the population was between 1.0 and 1.8%. We also measured recurrence of confl ict (i.e., length of time until another severe confl ict occurred in the vicinity of a removal event) as a measure of effi cacy. Of the 27 removals, there were 9 with recurrence with an average of 245 days (range 30-546) between removals, and 18 events without recurrence and with a mean time since confl ict event of 1,042 days (range 133-2,159). For our community-level hazing experiment, we used wildlife cameras to record activity of both people and coyotes at 4 sites (2 treatment and 2 control). At treatment sites with a prior history of confl ict, we educated and encouraged people to haze visible coyotes and hypothesized that hazing would decrease the activity overlap between people and coyotes on treatment sites. We recorded > 50,000 independent sightings of people and coyotes and found activity overlap between humans and coyotes to be either similar or greater on treatment sites compared to control sites. Our results indicate that reactive nonlethal hazing as conducted in this study was ineff ective in reducing human-coyote activity overlap. However, due to a variety of reasons we detail below, we encourage readers to interpret the hazing results with caution. We conclude that reactive lethal removal of problem individuals is an eff ective means of managing confl ict and that proactive nonlethal strategies are critical as well.",NA,"CE","CE_7441",401,0.22157474609944,0.0343944209761741,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

A test combining a controlled experiment with field observations","European Journal of Wildlife Research","Millions of animals are killed by vehicle collisions each year. As mitigation measures, wildlife warning reflectors have become increasingly popular, although clear evidence for their effectiveness is lacking. A reason for inconclusive results in the literature may be that most previous studies on the effectiveness of wildlife warning reflectors compare animal-vehicle collision rates with and without reflectors, a setting characterised by low event rates and weak experimental control. Animal behaviour can be expected to provide a more direct evidence for a possible effect of reflectors. In this study, we analyse roe deer behaviour in the presence of a blue semicircle reflector, one of the most frequently applied wildlife warning reflectors in Germany and other parts of Europe. Behavioural response to these reflectors (classified as no reaction, vigilance, short-distance flight and long-distance flight) was recorded both under controlled experimental conditions with captive roe deer and for free-ranging roe deer at road sections with traffic occurrence. We used generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) to test if reflector presence induced threat-related behaviour (vigilance, flight) and movement away from the reflectors. We found no significant evidence that the light stimulus emitted by reflectors was perceived as a threat or induced evasive movement. We conclude that our study provides no evidence that blue semicircle reflectors induce behaviour in roe deer that seems suitable to reduce roe deer-vehicle collisions.","10.1007/s10344-017-1130-5","CE","CE_7443",229,0.209045280529391,0.0244266785333994,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
7445,2014,"Agri-environment scheme enhances small mammal diversity and abundance at the farm-scale","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","The decline of farmland biodiversity over much of Europe has been largely attributed to agricultural intensification. Since the 1970s, governments have introduced agri-environment schemes (AES) aimed at mitigating this impact, but information on their success is limited. A five y, farm-scale experiment was conducted to test the efficacy of England's Environmental Stewardship AES in enhancing the species richness and abundance of small mammals (voles Cricetidae, mice Muridae, and shrews Soricidae) in an intensively-farmed arable landscape.Small mammal communities were sampled in spring and autumn on grassy field margins installed under the Entry Level Scheme (ELS) tier of Environmental Stewardship, where 1% of cropped land was converted to wildlife habitats. Results were compared with those from field margins on a second, experimental treatment (ELS Extra: ELSX) in which 5% of cropped land was taken out of production, and also field margins on a conventionally-farmed control treatment ('cross compliance': CC). Species richness and abundance of small mammals showed a significant increase on all treatments in spring and autumn. Many increases were greater on ELS and ELSX field margins compared to the CC controls, but there was little evidence that ELSX was more beneficial than ELS, and there were species-specific differences. Voles were not detected on any treatment in the initial sampling period but bank voles Myodes glareolus rapidly became abundant thereafter, particularly on ELS and ELSX field margins, and field voles Microtus agrestis also colonised. Wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus were present on all treatments in all sampling periods, but spring abundance declined as vole abundance increased.These results suggest that the Entry Level Scheme tier of the English agri-environment scheme is effective in enhancing small mammal communities on arable farmland, with potential benefits for higher trophic levels via their predators. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.agee.2014.04.009","CE","CE_7445",295,0.240649310629946,0.221232097038268,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
7446,2011,"Effects of large-scale removal of coyotes on pronghorn and mule deer productivity and abundance","Journal of Wildlife Management","Effective monitoring programs are designed to track changes in the distribution, occurrence, and abundance of species. We developed an extension of Royle and Kéry's (2007) single species model to estimate simultaneously temporal changes in probabilities of detection, occupancy, colonization, extinction, and species turnover using data on calling anuran amphibians, collected from 2002 to 2006 in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley of Louisiana, USA. During our 5-year study, estimates of occurrence probabilities declined for all 12 species detected. These declines occurred primarily in conjunction with variation in estimates of local extinction probabilities (cajun chorus frog [Pseudacris fouquettei], spring peeper [P. crucifer], northern cricket frog [Acris crepitans], Cope's gray treefrog [Hyla chrysoscelis], green treefrog [H. cinerea], squirrel treefrog [H. squirella], southern leopard frog [Lithobates sphenocephalus], bronze frog [L. clamitans], American bullfrog [L. catesbeianus], and Fowler's toad [Anaxyrus fowleri]). For 2 species (eastern narrowmouthed toad [Gastrophryne carolinensis] and Gulf Coast toad [Incilius nebulifer]), declines in occupancy appeared to be a consequence of both increased local extinction and decreased colonization events. The eastern narrow-mouthed toad experienced a 2.5-fold increase in estimates of occupancy in 2004, possibly because of the high amount of rainfall received during that year, along with a decrease in extinction and increase in colonization of new sites between 2003 and 2004. Our model can be incorporated into monitoring programs to estimate simultaneously the occupancy dynamics for multiple species that show similar responses to ecological conditions. It will likely be an important asset for those monitoring programs that employ the same methods to sample assemblages of ecologically similar species, including those that are rare. By combining information from multiple species to decrease the variance on estimates of individual species, our results are advantageous compared to single-species models.

We investigated the potential of arboriculture stands to enhance landscape diversity and increase farmland suitability for European hares in an intensive agricultural area of northern Italy. In spring 2005, we recorded hare habitat use during feeding activity and resting time by nocturnal censuses and searching for daytime resting sites, respectively. Hare presence/absence, based on faecal pellets, was assessed in 150 1-m radius plots. Hares positively selected edges and avoided woods and stubble during both feeding activity and resting time, which highlights the key role of permanent linear cover in providing the variety of vegetation types required by hares for shelter and feed. Forms were typically located in covered places, surrounded by denser vegetation than sample plots, in order to gain protection from avian and terrestrial predators. Arboriculture stands seem to be able to satisfy a part of hare habitat requirement, thanks to ground flora that provide tasty food, and tree cover that offers refuge against predators and bad weather conditions.

Vaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has been shown to reduce the severity and progression of experimentally induced TB in captive badgers. Analysis of data from a four-year clinical field study, conducted at the social group level, suggested a similar, direct protective effect of BCG in a wild badger population. Here we present new evidence from the same study identifying both a direct beneficial effect of vaccination in individual badgers and an indirect protective effect in unvaccinated cubs. We show that intramuscular injection of BCG reduced by 76% (Odds ratio = 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11-0.52) the risk of free-living vaccinated individuals testing positive to a diagnostic test combination to detect progressive infection. A more sensitive panel of tests for the detection of infection per se identified a reduction of 54% (Odds ratio = 0.46, 95% CI 0.26-0.88) in the risk of a positive result following vaccination.

However, factors that affect their use by native fauna in Australia are still largely unknown. We monitored 10 fauna underpasses for 13 months to determine factors affecting their use by southern brown bandicoots Isoodon obesulus fusciventer and western bobtail lizards Tiliqua rugosa rugosa. We trapped around each underpass five times to determine the size of the populations of these two species. Bandicoots and bobtail lizards were marked with passive implant transponders (PIT) and PIT readers and motion-activated infrared cameras recorded the number of crossings and the number of individuals that used each underpass. For bandicoots the mean weekly frequency of use corrected for population size and the proportion of the marked population that used each underpass were modelled against factors hypothesized to impact underpass use using generalized linear models. These were underpass length, cross-sectional area, vegetation cover at the entrances, presence or absence of logs and branches in the underpass (furniture), use by introduced predators and time since construction. Underpass length was negatively correlated with the frequency of use by bandicoots and time since construction was negatively correlated with the proportion of the population that used the underpasses. For western bobtail lizards none of the factors tested were strongly correlated with the frequency of use, or the proportion of the population that used the underpass. Based on these results, we recommend that the length of underpasses be kept to a minimum, possibly through the use of vegetated median strips allowing shorter underpasses to connect habitat on either side of the road. This would likely result in greater use than one long underpass spanning the entire width of the road.","10.1111/acv.12189","CE","CE_7470",282,0.112274865606004,0.022739273820045,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Mean acclimation for bighorns captured and released on-site was 5.0 days (SE-=-2.4, range-=-0-52).

Because acclimation periods after translocation releases are associated with increased mortality risk, managers should consider supplemental releases to minimize acclimation periods.","10.1002/wsb.441","CE","CE_7474",183,0.204136639856003,0.152148805402498,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
7476,2014,"Review and analysis of Australian macropod translocations 1969-2006","Mammal Review","Translocations have become an increasingly popular tool in threatened macropod conservation in Australia. Although previous evaluations of Australian macropod translocations have been published, the number of contemporary translocation programmes awaiting analysis, and new data regarding historic translocations, required a new assessment of macropod translocation programmes. We aimed to assess trends in the way macropod translocations were conducted during the period 1969-2006, determine the number of successful translocations and identify factors common to successful translocations. Data regarding macropod translocations were obtained from a wide variety of sources, including peer-reviewed journals, 'grey' literature and popular interest publications. Questionnaires were also sent to translocation managers to acquire detailed information. Specific aspects of macropod translocation methodology were analysed, and classification tree analysis was conducted to identify methodological and environmental factors common to successful translocations. We identified 109 macropod translocations for which sufficient data could be collected to permit analysis. Using the presence of a population on 1 January 2007 as a simple criterion, 61% of translocations were successful. Of these translocations, 66% were also considered successful by Short etal.'s criteria (population persisted for five years and is deemed likely to continue to persist); the remainder could not be assessed due to lack of data or insufficient elapsed time since release. Classification tree analysis suggested methodological and environmental factors common to successful translocations; the overriding factor determining success was the absence of cats and foxes at the release site. Although Australian macropod translocation proponents are faced with myriad methodological options when designing a translocation protocol, the primary consideration should be whether or not cats or foxes are present at the release site. Managers should be aware that there may be no safe population level of such predators for some translocation candidate species. Ignoring this fact will inevitably lead to a repeat of past translocation failures. © 2014 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","10.1111/mam.12020","CE","CE_7476",304,0.211786115954305,0.197792662007516,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
7481,2015,"Small mammals in farmlands of Argentina: responses to organic and conventional farming","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","Despite the important positive role that small mammals have in agricultural systems, mainly through their contribution to food webs, few studies have been conducted on the biodiversity and abundance of this group. Considering that Argentina is one of the most important agricultural regions of the world, our objective was to assess the effect of farming practices (organic vs. conventional) on species richness and abundance of small mammals in border habitats from agroecosystems of central Argentina. We predicted that the effects of farming practices on small mammal populations would vary with the degree of habitat specialization of species. We expected higher species richness and abundance of specialist species in border habitats of organic than on conventional farms. We found that farming practices did not explain species richness; the number of species in border habitats was low with small variation between managements. Management, season and vegetation volume explained abundance of both specialist and generalist species in border habitats, but with additive effects in the former and interactive effects in the latter. During summer, Calomys musculinus, Calomys laucha and Akodon azarae were more abundant in border habitats of organic than on conventional farms. This could be related to the highest reproductive activity of these species in this season, associated to the highest habitat quality of organic border habitats. Also, organic farms may have an important role for specialist species in poor-quality habitats at the beginning and at the end of the reproductive period (spring and autumn). Our results showed a positive trend in small mammal abundance of organic farms in farmlands under intensive agriculture. The differences between Argentinian and European agriculture systems are discussed.","10.1016/j.agee.2015.05.007","CE","CE_7481",272,0.239620557990339,0.254703882686644,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
7484,2013,"Grizzly bear and human interaction in Yellowstone National Park: An evaluation of bear management areas","Journal of Wildlife Management","Wildlife managers often rely on permanent or temporary area closures to reduce the impact of human presence on sensitive species. In 1982, Yellowstone National Park created a program to protect threatened grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) from human disturbance. The bear management area (BMA) program created areas of the park where human access was restricted. The program was designed to allow unhindered foraging opportunities for bears, decrease the risk of habituation, and provide safety for backcountry users. The objective of our study was to evaluate human-bear interaction in BMAs and determine if they were effective. We used human and grizzly bear global positioning system location data to study 6 of 16 BMAs from 2007 to 2009. We contrasted data when BMAs were unrestricted (open human access) and restricted (limited human access). We used location data collected when BMAs were unrestricted to delineate a human recreation area (HRA) and determined a daily human active and inactive period. We applied the HRA and daily activity times to bear location data and evaluated how bear movement behavior changed when people were present and absent. We found that grizzly bears were twice as likely to be within the HRA when BMAs were restricted. We also found that grizzly bears were more than twice as likely to be within the HRA when BMAs were unrestricted, but people were inactive. Our results suggest that human presence can displace grizzly bears if people are allowed unrestricted access to the 6 BMAs in our study. Our study provides evidence for the utility of management closures designed to protect a threatened species in a well-visited park. Our approach can be reapplied by managers interested in balancing wildlife conservation and human recreation. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

7487,2016,"Predator exclusion as a management option for increasing white-tailed deer recruitment","Journal of Wildlife Management","Lethal control of coyotes (Canis latrans) is a mechanism for increasing white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) recruitment but can be difficult to implement and may be ineffective on small parcels of land because of coyote immigration. In 2003, we constructed 4 40-ha mesopredator exclosures with the objective of quantifying the influence of mesopredators, including coyotes, on select wildlife populations and communities. Camera trapping indicated neonate/adult female white-tailed deer ratios were approximately 2 times greater inside predator exclosures than in control plots. Hunter success data provided further evidence of increased recruitment associated with exclosures relative to the remainder of the study site. Because exclosures were located on the boundary of our study area and off-site white-tailed deer harvest records were not available, we used estimates of deer density, sex ratios, reproductive rates, relative use of exclosures, and neonate survival inside and outside of exclosures to parameterize a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the impact of our 4 exclosures on neonate recruitment into the start of the firearms hunting season on a 1,600-ha area. After 1,000 iterations, we estimated that predator exclusion provided an additional 18 ± 0.13 (x¯ ± SE; median = 15, interquartile range [IQR] = 9-24) recruits/year above that expected without exclusion. Simulated neonate/adult female ratio was 0.74 ± 0.03 (median = 0.72, IQR = 0.52-0.93) with exclosures and 0.41 ± 0.008 (median = 0.39, IQR = 0.21-0.58) without. Simulated exclosure impact on recruitment was most sensitive to white-tailed deer relative use of exclosures and was least sensitive to neonate survival inside exclosures. We suggest that predator exclusion may be an effective mechanism for reducing neonate mortality and increasing white-tailed deer recruitment in areas where neonate survival is affected by predation. Exclosures may be particularly valuable on small parcels of land where predator removal would be offset by immigration. Finally, exclosures provide refuge from predators throughout the year, and we hypothesize exclosures may also contribute to adult survival and reduce impacts of predation risk that may also affect white-tailed deer population dynamics. Additional research incorporating variation in exclosure size and white-tailed deer density is needed to better evaluate predator exclosures for creating neonate refugia and mitigating sub-lethal impacts of predation.","10.1002/jwmg.999","CE","CE_7487",346,0.272496500467092,0.0925273735175433,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
7498,2017,"Evaluating nest supplementation as a recovery strategy for the endangered rodents of the Florida Keys","Restoration Ecology","The Key Largo woodrat (Neotoma floridana smalli) and Key Largo cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus allapaticola) are federally endangered subspecies endemic to the tropical hardwood hammocks of Key Largo, Florida. Woodrats are considered generalists in habitat and diet, yet a steady decline in natural stick nests and capture rates over the past several decades suggests that they are limited by the availability of nesting habitat due to habitat loss and fragmentation. The more specialized Key Largo cotton mouse appears to rely on old growth hammock, a habitat type that is rare following past land clearing. In 2004, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service started building supplemental nest structures to restore habitat quality and connectivity for these endangered rodents, but nest use requires evaluation. We used camera traps and occupancy models to evaluate the factors influencing woodrat and cotton mouse use of the supplemental nests. We detected woodrats at 65 and cotton mice at 175 of 284 sampled nest structures, with co-occurrence at 38 nests. Woodrat nest use followed a gradient from low nest use in the north to high nest use in the south, which might relate to the proximity of free-ranging domestic cat (Felis catus) colonies in residential developments. Cotton mouse nest use, however, was related positively to mature hammock and related negatively to disturbed areas (e.g. scarified lands). The two species occurred independently of each other. Stick-stacking behavior was observed at supplemental nests and, although it was correlated with detection of woodrats, it was not a strong predictor of their occurrence. We suggest that nest supplementation can be an important tool for species recovery as habitat quality continues to improve with succession.","10.1111/rec.12418","CE","CE_7498",273,0.245742950913339,0.10148319584588,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
7499,2012,"Identifying unidirectional and dynamic habitat filters to faunal recolonisation in restored mine-pits","Journal of Applied Ecology","1.There is increasing evidence that passive faunal recolonisation of restored areas can take decades or even centuries, reducing benefits to biodiversity from restoration. Thus, there is a need to develop restoration and management strategies that facilitate and accelerate faunal recolonisation. This requires identification of habitat features that act as filters to slow or prevent recolonisation and whether those filters are temporally unidirectional or dynamic. 2.We investigated successional patterns of reptiles and mammals in restored mine-pits in south-western Australia to identify potential filters to faunal recolonisation. We sampled reptiles and small mammals using 30 trapping grids across each of four restoration ages (4, 8, 12 and 17-years old) and unmined forest and assessed vegetation structure to identify animal-habitat relationships. 3.Mammal communities in restored areas converged on unmined forest communities as restoration matured, and all species recolonised rapidly, indicating there were no filters to mammal recolonisation. In contrast, reptile communities did not converge in the same way, indicating there were filters that slowed or prevented reptile recolonisation. We identified three reptile species that were slow, or failed, to recolonise restored areas and a fourth species that rapidly recolonised but disappeared as restoration matured. We identified low coarse woody debris (CWD) volumes and high overstorey stem densities as likely filters; the former is a unidirectional filter that will decrease gradually over long time frames, possibly centuries, while the latter is a dynamic filter that fluctuates in its intensity over short time frames of years. 4.Synthesis and applications. Our study adds to growing evidence that filters to faunal recolonisation may be widespread in restored areas, with important implications for restoration practices. Firstly, examining individual species may more effectively identify filters than examining community successional patterns. Secondly, filters can persist over long time frames, possibly centuries, so management, such as the provision and accelerated development of CWD, may need to occur over similar time frames. Lastly, filters can be dynamic and repeated management interventions, such as thinning, may be required to overcome these filters. The growing evidence for filters suggests that facilitating faunal recolonisation is more complex than simply returning vegetation to restoration sites.

7503,2012,"A review of fauna in mine rehabilitation in Australia: Current state and future directions","Biological Conservation","Restoration of degraded land has been identified as a top research priority in conservation. Fauna plays a critical role in the re-establishment of a functional ecosystem, yet fauna recolonization of restored areas is less studied than flora. We reviewed the findings of 71 publications on fauna recolonization, through the example of mining rehabilitation in the Australian continent, a global stronghold of large-scale mining.Species densities and richness were frequently lower in rehabilitated compared to undisturbed areas, even more so when only native species were considered. Amongst all criteria used to measure success, recovery of the pre-mining fauna community composition was the hardest to achieve. Introduced species were often found in rehabilitated areas but further research is needed to determine the duration of this association. Meta-analyses of the factors influencing mining rehabilitation success for fauna revealed that fauna groups recolonized heterogeneously. Recolonization was dependent on the methods used to rehabilitate and the number of years since rehabilitation. Notably, methods combining the use of fresh topsoil with the addition of seeds and seedlings were most successful for fauna recolonization, both in term of fauna density and richness.Limitations to this review included strong biases toward certain mining companies, as well as missing data, which decreased the power of meta-analysis. Available publications did not evenly represent all fauna taxa and studies were short when compared to the time needed to re-construct whole ecosystems. We consider the development of comprehensive fauna standards for assessing rehabilitation success critical. This could be the next challenge in restoration ecology. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2012.02.003","CE","CE_7503",259,0.241351044971781,0.273640724133716,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Culvert use was measured with camera traps positioned at 19 drainage culverts along an 8-km stretch of 'Thunderbolt's Way' near Nowendoc on the Northern Tableland, north-eastern New South Wales. The estimated probability of the occupancy/use of a culvert by a wombat was 0.46±0.10. Culvert use was related to structural variables (e.g. diameter and length) and both the distance to the next adjacent culvert and to forest cover. This suggests that wombats readily use drainage culverts to cross under roads and that these structures could be modified (e.g. by maintaining proximate forest cover) to increase the likelihood that wombats would use them, thus reducing vehicle collisions and road mortality of wombats. © Australian Mammal Society 2013.","10.1071/AM11042","CE","CE_7505",159,0.059309959681608,0.0741359859204122,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
7507,2017,"Efficacy of travel management areas for reducing disturbance to mule deer during hunting seasons","Wildlife Society Bulletin","For 50 years, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, USA, has designated travel management areas (TMAs) in which certain roads are closed to motorized traffic during hunting seasons with the goal of reducing disturbance to mule deer (Odocoilius hemionus). The efficacy of TMAs has not been tested. We measured the effects of temporary road closures on mule deer locations during the 2015 hunting season in 2 TMAs in eastern Oregon. We used data collected during 1 August31 October 2015 from female mule deer (n = 90) fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) transmitters programmed for a 13-hr fix interval. Euclidean distance to the nearest closed and open road was measured for each GPS location. Our results for Murderers CreekFlagtail and Camp Creek TMAs were mixed but opposite to our predictions. Locations of deer that were nearer to open roads than closed roads were more frequent than expected for both TMAs. Mean distance from a deer location to a closed road was less than to an open road in both TMAs (85% less in Camp Creek and 21% less in Murderers CreekFlagtail) but then in both cases, mean distance to any road (closed or open) was >2× greater inside the TMA than outside. Our results found no consistent effect of temporary demarcations of road closures in the TMAs. Management recommendations include designating a more even balance of closed and open roads for statistically improved monitoring of TMA efficacy, better enforcement of road closures during hunting seasons, and better demarcation (signage) of both closed and open roads in each TMA. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/wsb.771","CE","CE_7507",254,0.394445375491534,0.113653637161939,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
7508,2014,"The effect of coterie relocation on release-site retention and behavior of Utah prairie dogs","Journal of Wildlife Management","Utah prairie dogs (Cynomys parvidens) have been extirpated in 90% of their historical range. Because most populations in Utah occur on private land, this threatened species is continually in conflict with landowners. The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources has been relocating Utah prairie dogs from private to public land since the 1970s, but relocations have been largely unsuccessful because of high mortality. Utah prairie dogs are highly social animals, but they are usually relocated without regard to their family group, or coterie. We predicted that relocating Utah prairie dogs with other coterie members would improve their survival rate and result in post-release behavior similar to non-relocated animals. We chose to investigate release-site retention as a measure of relocation success because we were unable to separate emigration from mortality. We relocated Utah prairie dogs from the Cedar Ridge Golf Course in Cedar City, Utah to 2 prepared sites near Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah in 2010 and 2011. We relocated prairie dogs as groups of coterie members or in a control group of individuals trapped with no regard to relatedness. Two months after relocation, we set traps to recapture animals to estimate release-site retention. We quantified activity budgets prior to and following relocation on study animals as well as from a previously established relocated prairie dog population on public land. The best predictor of release-site retention and recapture rate was the animal's weight at initial capture. Larger animals had high retention but low recapture rates. We found no differences in site retention or behavior between prairie dogs relocated with coteries and controls. Relocated individuals behaved more like prairie dogs on public lands than animals in the urban source population, but behaviors were still different from prairie dogs on public lands. We recommend relocating large, adult Utah prairie dogs rather than juveniles or relocating juveniles later in the trapping season to increase relocation success rate. We also suggest that future research should focus on developing additional release methods to reduce dispersal and increase site retention. © 2014 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2014.","10.1002/jwmg.755","CE","CE_7508",340,0.249418366304122,0.0718357392384941,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

We analysed island fox diet on San Nicolas Island during 2006-12 to assess the influence of the removal of feral cats (Felis catus) on the food use by foxes. Our objective was to determine whether fox diet patterns shifted in response to the cat removal conducted during 2009-10, thus indicating that cats were competing with foxes for food items. We also examined the influence of annual precipitation patterns and fox abundance on fox diet. On the basis of an analysis of 1975 fox scats, use of vertebrate prey - deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), birds, and lizards - increased significantly during and after the complete removal of cats (n=66) from the island. Deer mouse abundance increased markedly during and after cat removal and use of mice by foxes was significantly related to mouse abundance. The increase in mice and shift in item use by the foxes was consistent with a reduction in exploitative competition associated with the cat removal. However, fox abundance declined markedly coincident with the removal of cats and deer mouse abundance was negatively related to fox numbers. Also, annual precipitation increased markedly during and after cat removal and deer mouse abundance closely tracked precipitation. Thus, our results indicate that other confounding factors, particularly precipitation, may have had a greater influence on fox diet patterns.","10.1071/PC16037","CE","CE_7509",235,0.137006066527734,0.0871833387404939,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The Piedmont Regional Administration has been running a program aimed at monitoring the wolf expansion process and mitigating the human-wolf conflict since 1999. Three key actions, i) compensation of canids (wolf and dog) damage; ii) a subsidy system to promote good livestock husbandry practices; iii) promotion of preventive measures, were used to prevent and compensate damage caused by wolves. Direct damage was verified by veterinarians and refunded according to an annually updated price list. In addition indirect losses were compensated on a lump-sum basis proportional to the herd size for each attack. Since 2007 a subsidy system has rewarded shepherds who, pasturing within the home range of wolf packs and in neighbouring areas, have adopted good management practices and preventive measures. Ad hoc damage prevention plans have mainly addressed chronic situations. Changes in animal husbandry (removal of dead livestock from pastures, confining sick animals, synchronizing births and using shed lambing), promotion of use of electric fences and introduction of livestock guarding dogs (LGDs) have been the most common interventions. A new model of electrified net has been developed and LGDs have been selected and diffused; LGDs behavioural research is in progress. The Regional wolf Program integrates different measures to manage the human-wolf conflict: not only to compensate depredation damages, but also to stimulate the adoption of husbandry practices compatible with the presence of wolves.

Furthermore, because of the undeniable difficulty of small-mammal track identification, most biologists usually carry out general surveys without species recognition. We hypothesized that general surveys traditionally used for monitoring WRC by small mammals may be biased because the degraded habitats along roads are mainly used by generalist and not specialist species. For this reason, we compared the results of a general small-mammal survey with those from a species-specific one, focusing on 3 study species: 1 habitat generalist (North American deer mouse [Peromyscus maniculatus]), 1 forest specialist (southern red-backed vole [Myodes gapperi]), and 1 prairie specialist (meadow vole [Microtus pennsylvanicus]). We sampled along 4 types of WCS (overpasses, open-span underpasses, and both elliptical and box culverts) in Banff National Park (Canada), by placing footprint track tubes along the WCS, and as a reference in front of their entrances (mainly located in roadside grasslands) and in the surrounding woodlands. Using the traditional general survey, we did not detect significant differences in small-mammal presence among WCS and reference sites. In contrast, species-specific surveys showed that only the deer mouse (a generalist species) consistently used the WCS. The deer mice did not show preferences for any WCS type, whereas the specialist species (voles) used only overpasses. Therefore, general surveys used without species identification can underestimate the value of WCS for specialist small mammals, with relevant conservation implications. As a consequence, we recommend species-specific surveys of WCS suitability for small mammals. We also suggest improving the habitat (or at least the cover availability) in the WCS and along the space between them and the surrounding environments to increase WCS suitability for specialist species.","10.1002/jwmg.900","CE","CE_7513",291,0.202256763492523,0.132705632284836,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Soft-release measures, including acclimatisation, have been used for many species around the world, based on the reasoning that gradual and supported reintroductions should improve the success of animals released into an unfamiliar wild environment. However, experimental testing of soft-release methods is rare. Aims To experimentally test the effect of a soft-release method versus a hard-release method on the initial reintroduction success of the eastern barred bandicoot (Perameles gunnii). Methods We released 12 captive-bred eastern barred bandicoots into a predator-proof reserve using two methods: soft-release (7 days of on-site acclimatisation with supplementary food before release) and hard-release (no acclimatisation and no supplementary food). We monitored the bandicoots intensively via radio-tracking and live-trapping for 4 weeks after release. Compared with hard-release bandicoots, we predicted that soft-release bandicoots would have (1) reduced movement (first night dispersal, site fidelity and activity range), (2) more directed patterns of habitat selection, (3) improved bodyweights and (4) improved survival. Key results There was no detectable difference in habitat selection, overall weight change and survival between the soft-release and hard-release groups. There was moderate evidence that, compared with the hard-release group, soft-release bandicoots moved less, demonstrated lower individual variation in all measures of movement, and lost weight more gradually after release. In most cases, effect sizes were moderate to large but had large standard errors owing to both small sample size and high variance. Consequently, statistical testing failed to detect significant differences at the 5% level. Conclusions Despite evidence that the release method influenced some of the monitored behaviours, soft-release did not confer a consistent and substantive advantage for captive-bred eastern barred bandicoots at our site. We conclude that soft-release is unlikely to improve overall reintroduction success for this species at fenced predator-free sites. Implications The present study suggests that the preferred option for reintroductions of eastern barred bandicoots to fenced sites is a hard-release, information that is now being used to guide reintroductions of this species. Similar experiments should be undertaken to improve reintroduction practice for other endangered species.","10.1071/WR14257","CE","CE_7519",360,0.265531888752347,0.103935612978541,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Reintroductions are often time consuming, expensive, and controversial, and thus understanding what aspects are important for a successful program is needed. Focusing on the example of the reintroduction of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) to Colorado, we investigated how different release protocols (RP) affected mortality within the first year post-release. We found that average monthly mortality in the study area during the first year decreased with time in captivity from 0.205 (95% CI = 0.069, 0.475) for lynx having spent up to 7 days in captivity to 0.028 (95% CI = 0.012, 0.064) for lynx spending >45 days in captivity before release. Our results also suggest that keeping lynx in captivity beyond 5-6 weeks accrued little benefit in terms of monthly survival. We found that, on a monthly average basis, lynx were as likely to move out (P = 0.196, SE = 0.032) as well as back onto (P = 0.143, SE = 0.034) the reintroduction area during the first year after release. Mortality was 1.6 times greater outside of the study area, suggesting that permanent emigration and differential mortality rates on and off reintroduction areas should be factored into sample size calculations for an effective reintroduction effort. A post-release monitoring plan is critical to providing information to assess aspects of RP and to improve survival of individuals. Future lynx and other carnivore reintroductions may use our results to help design reintroduction programs including both the release and post-release monitoring protocols. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.89","CE","CE_7521",239,0.275877513309534,0.148118126025035,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

During 2007-2012 we gathered 159 24-h focal samples on 15 radio-marked individuals (11 captive-reared, four wild-reared; seven adults, eight juveniles), 216 records of beginning and end of activity bouts on 20 individuals, and 454 camera-traps records (3345 trap-days). We estimated the daily hours of activity, the percentage of diurnal and nocturnal activity, and the daily activity range and time overlap using time as a circular variable in kernel density estimations. We assessed differences between seasons, sexes, age classes, and types of rearing. The average daily hours of activity was 8:43 h. Camera-traps and radio-telemetry showed similar results. Animals exhibited both diurnal (60-65%) and nocturnal (40-35%) activity. The higher probability for being active ranged within 09:00-03:00 h. Anteaters spent more hours active and were more nocturnal during summer. Activity was highly overlapped between sexes, and wild-reared individuals were more nocturnal than captive-reared ones. Seasonal shifts in daily activity highlights the importance of thermoregulation as a selective factor in this species. The giant anteater is a cathemeral species with flexibility to accommodate its activity pattern to local conditions or experience.","10.1515/mammalia-2015-0088","CE","CE_7524",197,0.170622155538535,-0.0117881988437508,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
7527,2011,"Influence of underpasses and traffic on white-tailed deer highway permeability","Wildlife Society Bulletin","Highways constitute barriers to wildlife passage, or permeability, which fragment populations and habitats. The degree of barrier effect caused by roadways varies by wildlife species, highway type and standard, and traffic volume. We assessed deer-highway relationships along a 27-km stretch of highway in central Arizona, USA. Our research objectives were to 1) assess white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) highway crossing patterns and permeability, 2) compare deer permeability on 4-lane reconstructed and 2-lane control sections to determine the influence of wildlife underpasses, and 3) assess and compare deer passage relationships to traffic volume. We fitted 13 deer with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars between 2004 and 2007. Eleven deer crossed the highway 395 times. On 2 control sections, deer crossed an average of 0.02 times/day, while on 3 reconstructed sections they averaged 15 times more crossings/day (0.28; t 13 = -2.35; P = 0.035). The deer passage rate on control sections averaged 0.03 crossings/approach, approximately 20% of that for reconstructed sections (0.16; t 13 = -2.43; P = 0.030). We linked hourly traffic volumes to our GPS data to examine how passage rates and the proportion of deer relocations at different distances from the highway varied with traffic volume. Deer distance from the highway showed minimal shift away from the highway with increased traffic, and at-grade passage rates were low (=0.1 crossings/approach) across all traffic volumes. Although our linear regression analysis found no relationship between deer passage rate and increasing traffic volume on reconstructed sections with underpasses, there was a strong negative relationship on control sections (r = -0.881; P = 0.05); thus, we conclude that deer passage rates were minimally affected by traffic on reconstructed sections where passage structures facilitated below-grade passage. Further, from the 865 deer groups we recorded on videotape at 5 underpasses, traffic levels did not affect below-grade deer passage at the volumes we studied. Passage structures improved highway permeability across reconstructed sections with underpasses where traffic volume had a much lower impact compared to deer crossing at highway grade on control sections. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/wsb.31","CE","CE_7527",315,0.0891401941922617,0.0546981774704851,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

We describe the reintroductions of large carnivores (>10 kg) that have occurred in the Eastern Cape and use various criteria to assess their success. Lion Panthera leo reintroduction has been highly successful with a population of 56 currently extant in the region and problems of overpopulation arising. The African wild dog Lycaon pictus population has increased to 24 from a founder population of 11. Preliminary results for spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta also indicate success. Wild populations of leopards Panthera pardus exist on several reserves and have been supplemented by translocated individuals, although deaths of known individuals have occurred and no estimate of reproduction is available. Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus reintroduction has also been less successful with 36 individuals reintroduced and 23 cubs being born but only 41 individuals surviving in 2005. Criteria for assessing the success of reintroductions of species that naturally occur in low densities, such as top predators, generally have limited value.

In grasslands, burning may have this effect for mammalian herbivores by decreasing vegetation height, potentially making burned areas safer habitats. However, few studies have tested the impacts of burning on the perceived predation risk of herbivores. Vigilance can be used as a measure of habitat safety and therefore should be lower in burned areas than unburned areas. We tested the impacts of prescribed burning on vigilance by Thomson's gazelles in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Both individual vigilance, proportion of time an individual spends looking, and group vigilance, proportion of a group looking, of Thomson's gazelles was observed in burned and unburned areas before and after presenting a model cheetah to each group. Surprisingly, both individual and group vigilance was the same in both habitats pre- and post-cheetah addition and removal. This is despite the fact that both vegetation height and biomass were lower in burned areas than unburned areas. Thus, it does not appear that Thomson's gazelles perceive burned areas to be safer habitats than unburned areas. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/aje.12044","CE","CE_7538",190,0.177472980827429,-0.00795153185796791,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

The effects of the repellents were assessed by comparing deer visitation rates to sand arenas before and after application of repellents and visitation rates to control arenas. Neither of the tested products reduced deer visitation rates. Rapid habituation to olfactory stimuli and lack of sensitivity to predator odours may explain the ineffectiveness of the repellents to alter the behaviour of the deer.

Effects of sown wildflower fields on the common hamster (<i>Cricetus cricetus</i>) at local and landscape scales","Biological Conservation","During the last decades, agriculture has been rapidly intensified, resulting in a strong decline in species diversity. Therefore the common agricultural policy (CAP) of the EU implemented agri-environmental schemes (AES) for an environmentally-friendly management of agricultural areas. Sown wildflower fields are one of these measures aimed at enhancing insect diversity and related ecosystem services. However, little is known about the impacts of AES on rare and non-target species. To study the effect of these AES on a non-target species, the occurrence of the endangered common hamster (. Cricetus cricetus) was mapped by counting reopened winter burrows on paired sown wildflower fields and agricultural fields in North-West Bavaria, Germany. Concentration effects in sown wildflower fields and the distribution of C. cricetus in adjacent agricultural fields were studied by mapping burrows up to a distance of 200. m from sown wildflower and agricultural fields. Furthermore, C. cricetus occurrence in relation to local (vegetation density, cover of grasses, vegetation height, size of wildflower fields) and landscape scale parameters (percentage of arable land, grassland, fallow land, distance to the nearest forest, and settlement) of sown wildflower fields was analysed. Results show that there was a concentration of C. cricetus in sown wildflower fields, while densities in adjacent agricultural fields were constantly low. Hamster occurrence was negatively related to vegetation density and grass cover on sown wildflower fields and positively related to distance to the nearest forests, percentage of arable land and fallow land around wildflower fields. In conclusion, we could show that sown wildflower fields can be an ideal habitat for non-target species, such as the common hamster. However, local and landscape scale parameters of sown wildflower fields need to be considered when designing AES.","10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.021","CE","CE_7553",285,0.130573265684127,0.0414191769877328,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Even with an increase in the number of reserves, protecting wildlife has proven difficult and many reserves remain little different from unprotected areas. In Brazil, private landowners are being encouraged by federal and state governments and non-governmental organizations to participate in a national conservation strategy by setting aside land for preservation. However, due to chronic hunting pressure, the role that private reserves might play remains to be determined. In this study we analyze the potential of private reserves through a case study of the Reserva Ecológica Michelin in Bahia, Brazil. We measured the relative abundances of medium and large mammals before and after the implementation of guard patrols, to determine the efficacy of this management strategy for protecting wildlife. The relative abundance of the fauna increased by 72.6 % after the initiation of guard patrols, from 5.07 to 8.68 encounters/10 km, with preferred game species (Dasypus novemcinctus, Cuniculus paca, Pecari tajacu, and Mazama americana) increasing by 146.7-300%. Similarities between the relative abundances of preferred game species at our site after the initiation of the guard patrols and those of other protected Neotropical reserves indicate that the Michelin reserve is now being effectively protected. Although the cost of $9.4/ha to protect the reserve is high, this study shows that the private reserve initiative can be an effective component of the national conservation strategy. © Kevin M.

Deer-crossing warning signage is one of the oldest forms of mitigating deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs), but despite their low cost and logistical simplicity, the effectiveness of standard-sized permanent warning signage at reducing DVCs has not previously been adequately determined. We used historical DVC data, based on deer carcass retrieval, to identify and target areas and periods of high collision frequency. We installed warning signs at these high collision frequency locations and then compared DVCs to un-signed control locations. The total number of DVCs at signed hotspots was significantly different in the year after the signs were installed, compared to the 3 prior years (F 13 = 4.99, P = 0.004). Although the single year of posttreatment data means the long-term efficacy of warning signage remains unknown, we showed that in the first year after installation, deer-crossing signs targeting high collision locations can be effective at reducing DVCs. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/wsb.12","CE","CE_7558",182,0.219739957765771,-0.0667028491374327,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Predation by feral cats Felis sylvestris catus is one hypothesised cause. Most evidence of cat impacts on native prey comes from islands, where cat densities are often high, but cats typically occur at low densities on mainland Australia. We conducted a field experiment to measure the effect of predation by low-density cat populations on the demography of a native small mammal. We established two 12·5-ha enclosures in tropical savanna in the Northern Territory. Each enclosure was divided in half, with cats allowed access to one half but not the other. We introduced about 20 individuals of a native rodent, Rattus villosissimus, into each of the four compartments (two enclosures × two predator-access treatments). We monitored rat demography by mark-recapture analysis and radiotracking, and predator incursions by camera surveillance and track and scat searches. Rat populations persisted over the duration of the study (18 months) in the predator-proof treatment, where we detected no predator incursions, but declined to extinction in both predator-accessible compartments. In one case, cat incursions were frequently detected and the rat population was rapidly extirpated (<3 months); in the other, cat incursions were infrequent, and the population declined more gradually (c. 16 months) due to low recruitment. We detected no incursions by dingoes Canis dingo, the other mammalian predator in the area. Synthesis and applications. This is the first study to provide direct evidence that cats are capable of extirpating small mammals in a continental setting, in spite of their low population densities. This finding supports the hypothesis that predation by feral cats is contributing to declines of small mammals in northern Australia. The conservation management of native small mammals in northern Australia may require intensive control of cat populations, including large cat-free enclosures.

We documented wildlife use and compared successful UP crossings by various species and among UP. From 2002 to 2008, we recorded visits by 15,134 animals of 21 species (16 wildlife, 5 domestic) resulting in 72.4% crossing through UP. Elk (Cervus elaphus) accounted for 68% of recorded animals, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (O. hemionus) accounted for 13% and 6%, respectively. As elk and white-tailed deer were the only species adequately represented across all UP, we used logistic regression to further evaluate factors associated with successful use of UP. To evaluate habituation over time we limited this analysis to 5 UP monitored for =4 yr. For elk, structural attributes and placement, season, time of day, and months monitored were associated with successful elk UP crossing in year 1, however, by year 4 only structural attributes and placement were significant, suggesting that UP structure and placement likely were of primary importance for successful elk passage. By year 4, probabilities of crossing at 4 of 5 UP converged on >0.70, indicating that given sufficient time to allow habituation, most UP we evaluated appeared to be effective for elk, regardless of structural attributes or placement. For deer, only structural attribute and placement were significant, and aside from one structure did not increase in probability of a successful crossing over time. The overall number of animals and species that crossed SR 260 via UP underscores efficacy of UP in promoting multi-species permeability. Long-term monitoring allows wildlife and highway managers to evaluate adaptation to wildlife crossing structures by different species.

Lice infestation expanded north via wolf dispersal to the Tanana Flats of Interior Alaska in December 2003. Effects of this ectoparasite on wolves were persistent with moderate to severe clinical signs of pediculosis lasting multiple generations. Our objectives were to evaluate the extent of lice infestation on wolves within the Tanana Flats and develop a management program that limited further transmission. We implemented a treatment method that consisted of multiple applications of oral antiparasitic ivermectin-injected baits aerially distributed at den and rendezvous sites during mid-May through August. During 2005-2010, we evaluated 12-19 packs annually as part of a treatment group and 3 infested packs as a control. Infestation rates of treatment packs prior to treatment varied from 15% in 2005 (2 of 13), 50% in 2006 (7 of 14), 24% in 2007 (4 of 17), 5% in 2008 (1 of 19), and 0% in 2009-2010 (0 of 19). We treated 50%, 71%, and 75% of the infested treatment packs during 2005-2007, respectively.

The combination of treatment and harvest successfully eliminated the local source population of lice within 3 years and we found no evidence of lice infestation within the treatment area during the last 3 years of the study. By using this treatment method, managers can eliminate dog lice infestations of wolves in areas =13,000 km2. By initiating treatment promptly after detection, transmission to unexposed nearby packs can be postponed and the local source population of lice on wolves eradicated. © The Wildlife Society, 2013.","10.1002/jwmg.495","CE","CE_7567",251,0.259623608575544,-0.119971645160082,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Electric fences were installed around two flocks of sheep suffering from attacks by Iberian lynx. Before the experiment, both flocks grazed without any surveillance during the day. At night, sheep with a single lamb were left to roam freely or spent the night in a poorly constructed enclosure. Sheep with two lambs remained with their lambs without any type of protection. After the electrified enclosures were put in place, sheep with lambs were moved inside at night. No attacks were detected inside the electric fences.

A systematic review approach is applied to investigate the evidence from peer reviewed and grey literature on the effectiveness of PAs focusing on two outcomes: (a) habitat cover and (b) species populations. We only include studies that causally link conservation inputs to outcomes against appropriate counterfactuals. From 2599 publications we found 76 studies from 51 papers that evaluated impacts on habitat cover, and 42 studies from 35 papers on species populations. Three conclusions emerged: first, there is good evidence that PAs have conserved forest habitat; second, evidence remains inconclusive that PAs have been effective at maintaining species populations, although more positive than negative results are reported in the literature; third, causal connections between management inputs and conservation outcomes in PAs are rarely evaluated in the literature.

However, the influence of the spatial distribution of ranger stations on wildlife abundance and population structure has rarely been investigated. We evaluated the abundance and distribution of urial sheep Ovis vignei and Persian leopard Panthera pardus saxicolor in the steppe of Golestan National Park in northeastern Iran. The spatial distribution of these species in regard to anthropogenic (distances to ranger stations, villages and park border) and environmental variables (distance to water resources, average slope and normalized difference vegetation index) was assessed using systematic line transect sampling (186 km) and camera trapping (1150 trap nights). The studied steppe area is divided into three management zones differing in the number of ranger stations and their position with respect to park boundaries. The results of multivariate analyses highlighted that the distance to ranger stations was negatively related to the size and density of urial clusters and the most important variable in explaining urial distribution. Moreover, the distance to park borders influenced urial cluster density. Leopard abundance was positively associated with urial density but was less affected by the other variables tested. We found urial densities in the three management zones to range from 0.15 ± se 0.09 individuals km-2 (zone with just one station outside the park) to 21.77 ± se 7.92 individuals km-2 (zone with three stations). Taking into account these results and historical data on ungulate abundance and distribution in these management zones, we conclude that law enforcement from ranger stations has shaped current patterns of ungulate distribution. These results confirm that a good coverage (both numbers and locations) of ranger stations is of central importance for the management of protected areas.","10.1111/acv.12240","CE","CE_7573",292,0.206781854469681,0.154508303759728,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

This study evaluates the influence of three factors: environment, habitat management, and season on the presence and abundance of the wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), an important prey species for Mediterranean endangered predator species. To address this issue, we estimated wild rabbit presence and abundance by latrine counting in transects located in 45 plots within a 250 × 250 m grid from June 2007 until June 2009 in a 1,200 ha hunting area in southern Portugal. We then analyzed how wild rabbit presence and abundance correlate with the aforementioned factors. Our results showed that the main variable influencing wild rabbit presence and abundance was the distance to the artificial warrens. North and northeast slope directions were negatively related to wild rabbit presence. Conversely, rabbit presence was positively correlated with short distances to ecotone, artificial warrens, and spring. Regarding rabbit abundance, in addition to artificial warrens, soft soils, bushes, and season also had a positive effect. We found that environmental variables, management practices, and season each affect wild rabbit presence and abundance differently at a home range scale in low-density population. Thus, our major recommendations are reducing the distance to artificial warrens and ecotone, ideally to less than 100 m, and promoting habitat quality improvement on slopes with plenty of sun exposure. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s10344-013-0738-3","CE","CE_7576",235,0.396948729269033,0.366159135016402,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
7577,2015,"Specific nest box designs can improve habitat restoration for cavity-dependent arboreal mammals","Restoration Ecology","Tree-cavity-dependent wildlife faces future shortages of cavities due to a decline in the abundance of large, old trees in many parts of the world. Nest boxes are proposed as a tool to restore habitat value but evidence of their effectiveness for arboreal mammals remains equivocal. This may arise from a poor understanding of design preferences. We conducted investigations in two landscapes in eastern Australia to determine whether species show a preference for specific designs. We observed a preference by some mammal species for particular designs (33-78% occupied/used), suggesting that design refinement can improve the frequency with which nest boxes are used. Although feral species may out-compete target species for nest boxes, we did not observe this. We recorded feral honeybees (Apis mellifera) in 6-9% of nest boxes but they did not remain, and many occupied boxes were later used by mammals. The introduced common myna bird (Acridotheres tristis) was prevalent in one landscape, but competition for nest boxes was localized. For nest boxes to be an effective habitat restoration tool, they must be able to be occupied over long periods of time.

7587,2013,"Restocking a keystone species in a biodiversity hotspot: recovering the European rabbit on a landscape scale","Journal for Nature Conservation","Rabbit populations in Iberia remain at low densities in several areas in which their endangered predators still coexist, and the recovery of these populations is therefore urgent if the integrity of Iberian Mediterranean ecosystems is to be maintained. The enhancement of wild rabbit populations has been attempted through the use of in situ extensive rabbit captive breeding enclosures (restocking plots), which reduce mortality caused by terrestrial predators and dispersal movements and permit the breeding of young individuals which can then naturally disperse to settle in the surrounding areas. However, their effectiveness, the role of its size, the optimal habitat management that should be promoted around them and the habitat features remains uncertain. Here, we show results from a four year study of an ambitious rabbit restocking plan on a landscape scale. We measured rabbit abundance in a vast area in which thirty-two restocking plots were built to create an initial rabbit population for further dispersion, in addition to an intensive habitat management program. We also compared rabbit abundance between managed and unmanaged UTM cells of 2.5km×2.5km. Our results showed that rabbit abundance was three times higher in managed cells, but four years after restocking, rabbit abundances had only reached the threshold needed to support stable Iberian lynx presence (at least 10 latrines per km-1) in 9 of the 23 managed cells. Rabbit abundance was strongly affected by habitat treatment and scrub coverage. The increase of shelter was useful in low cover areas but ineligible in places with high scrub cover, where the increase of refuge plus scrub clearing to create pastures improve rabbit abundance more effectively. In the light of our results, restocking plots should be built only in places with suitable habitat, whereas pastures should be created in dense scrublands and refuge in low cover areas. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","10.1016/j.jnc.2013.07.006","CE","CE_7587",298,0.259070350275268,0.27764554299665,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

However, the success of traditional rabbit restocking is generally extremely low, and this has been attributed to short-term predation by mammalian carnivores. Hence, recent recovery programs have tackled the problem of terrestrial predators with the use of exclusion fences, but no additional measures have been employed to avoid aerial predation. In this study, we have therefore conducted a field experiment to test the short-term effect of total predation exclusion in rabbit restocking enclosures, comparing rabbit abundance in plots which are only accessible to raptors (top-open plots) and plots which are accessible to neither carnivores nor raptors (top-closed plots). The results showed that the top-closed plots had higher rabbit abundance in the short term, and the highest difference in rabbit abundance between the two kinds of fences was attained in the first 2 weeks. We therefore conclude that the top-closed plots were an effective tool to increase rabbit abundance during the first weeks after release through the exclusion of raptor predation. © 2013 Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Bialowieza, Poland.","10.1007/s13364-013-0140-2","CE","CE_7588",191,0.228960650876719,0.219134866166911,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

The wild European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus L., a hunted and threatened species in its native range, is at the same time a key species for the preservation of threatened Mediterranean predators. Cereal sowing is one of the most common practices to augment the food supply of rabbits, and it is used not only by hunters but also by conservationists. At present, limited scientific information is available regarding the effectiveness of cereal sowing. To evaluate its effectiveness, we analysed data on sowing trials conducted in 125 plots, located in 14 private estates throughout central Spain, most of them with low density populations. Brush was cleared from 44 of these plots prior to sowing. Our results indicated that rabbits preferentially selected sown areas over control (unsown) areas. This selection increased in plots that represented suitable habitats for rabbits, such as pasturelands, as well as when thicket islands and natural or artificial shelters were available within the sown plots. Local enhancement of rabbit populations was also observed. These positive results were also obtained regardless of the initial habitat conditions, not only in the treatment plots but also in the surrounding area.

We evaluated the effects of a traditional and a novel fencing design, constructed alongside a roadway, on movements and home ranges of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). From January to April 2009, we fitted 14 adult female deer with Global Positioning System collars, programmed to collect =24 locations/day. In June 2009 we constructed a 3.2-km fence that included a 1.6-km section of 2.4-m vertical-wire fence and a 1.6-km section of a prototype outrigger fence (i.e., 0.6 m, shade-cloth [50% opaque plastic sheeting] on a 45° outrigger angled toward the deer attached to the top of a 1.2 m, vertical-wire fence). We retrieved collars between January and March 2010. We compared home ranges, fence crossings, and fence circumventions among deer that encountered the outrigger and 2.4-m fences as well as for deer that encountered neither fence (i.e., controls), before and after fence construction. Actual crossings of the fence area were reduced, postconstruction, by 98% and 90% for the 2.4 m and outrigger treatment groups, respectively, suggesting that the fences were sufficiently effective to simulate how deer respond to roadside barriers. Deer with pretreatment home ranges that approached or encompassed the fence endings maintained a high degree of site fidelity by circumventing the endings. This study highlights the importance of incorporating information on deer behavior and resource usage into DVC-reduction strategies. If these factors are not accounted for, DVC frequency will likely stay the same, or increase, near fence endings. Thus, roadside fences should likely end at natural barriers to deer movements (i.e., heavy development) or incorporate some means of safe crossing into their endings. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/wsb.38","CE","CE_7591",285,0.152307395813158,0.189194100761087,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Accordingly, this study was carried out to investigate if in vitro matured and enucleated oocytes of domestic sheep could be used for interspecies conservation cloning of Esfahan mouflon (Ovis orientalis isphahanica), a vulnerable species classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Cryo-banked fibroblasts of a mouflon (derived from a genome resource bank) and a domestic sheep (prepared during a recent study) were cultured in vitro and used for karyotyping. Prior to SCNT, fibroblast donor cells were serum starved for 5 days. Using the zona-free SCNT technique, in vitro matured and enucleated domestic sheep oocytes were reconstituted with nuclei donor cells of mouflon and domestic sheep, and their competencies for in vitro development to the blastocyst stage were compared. The cloned mouflon blastocysts were then surgically transferred into the uterus of the synchronized domestic sheep. Karyotype analysis confirmed that fibroblasts of the Esfahan mouflon had the correct number of diploid chromosomes (2n = 54). Evaluation of 907 activated reconstructs [Esfahan mouflon (n = 667), domestic sheep (n = 240)] revealed no significant difference in the term of blastocyst development (7.6 ± 0.5% vs. 9.3 ± 0.5%, respectively). After the transfer of 12 cloned Esfahan mouflon blastocysts to five domestic sheep recipients, two (40.0%) pregnancies were established in which both (100%) were sustained until caesarean section (days 147 and 150 of pregnancy, respectively) and culminated in the live births of cloned Esfahan mouflon lambs. However, the newborns did not survive and died soon after birth.

Arctic foxes have been fully protected in Fennoscandia following their drastic decline in the early 19th century, and their lack of recovery has been hypothesized to result from increased interspecific competition with red foxes that have colonized the arctic fox's range and/or changes in prey dynamics due to increased variation in climatic conditions. We used a large-scale spatio-temporal study combined with an extensive red fox removal intervention to test these two hypotheses by evaluating the relative importance of diverse environmental factors affecting the recolonization of arctic foxes in Northern Norway. Arctic foxes were never observed at sites where just a few daily observations of red foxes were recorded, and the probability of recolonization was zero at sites where no red fox was removed. The probability of recolonization increased when lemming abundance was very high, but the relative importance of this variable was half that of red foxes. Thus, our results lend support to both hypotheses, but they clearly highlight the presence of red foxes as the factor most limiting arctic fox recolonization in this part of its distribution. As the abundance of arctic foxes has remained extremely low even after more than 70. years of full protection, direct conservation actions seem to be needed to promote the recovery of arctic fox populations. Our research therefore highlights that conservation actions targeting a major reduction in red fox numbers are needed because the competitive interaction with red foxes is the most important factor limiting recolonization of this species. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2013.01.011","CE","CE_7596",266,0.326792363432428,0.354494726577927,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

To gauge the overall influence of conservation intervention, we combined both programs into a single conservation treatment variable. Using 8 years of lion killing data, we applied Manski's partial identification approach with bounded assumptions to investigate the effect of conservation treatment on lion killing in 4 contiguous areas. In 3 of the areas, conservation treatment was positively associated with a reduction in lion killing. We then applied a generalized linear model to assess the relative efficacy of the 2 interventions.

We document the rehabilitation and release of three confiscated cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) cubs and one leopard (Panthera pardus) cub, which were taken from the wild in Botswana. The animals were raised with minimal human contact and the development of their hunting skills was observed and assisted by limited pre-release training. After release, all animals were monitored and data showed they successfully hunted, with behavioural patterns similar to wild conspecifics. All established stable home ranges at the release site. Home ranges of the cheetahs ranged from 44 to 121 km2, travelling primarily during the early morning and evening, ranging from 4.5 to 9.4 km/day. While the leopard survived and probably reproduced within a stable home range (449 km2), all three cheetahs were shot within 7 months of release. Therefore, although orphaned large felids can successfully hunt after release using appropriate rehabilitation techniques, they face the same humancarnivore conflicts of their wild counterparts.

Assisted reproductive techniques, including artificial insemination (AI), have been touted for decades as approaches that could contribute to the demographic and genetic management of rare species. Here, we report the first successful integration of AI with frozen semen into a formal recovery program and the positive impact on genetic diversity for the critically endangered black-footed ferret Mustela nigripes. Techniques developed in the taxonomically related domestic ferret Mustela putorius furo and Siberian polecat Mustela eversmannii were applied over time to selected black-footed ferrets, including semen banking from six of the last 18 survivors. After evaluation, processing and storage in liquid nitrogen (-196°C/-321°F), for as long as 20 years, sperm samples were thawed and transabdominally inseminated into the uterine horns of female conspecifics. Eight black-footed ferret offspring were produced using thawed sperm samples (including after two decades of cryopreservation) with inseminates containing as few as 3.4×106 motile spermatozoa. The incorporation of these offspring and/or their descendants into the ex situ breeding program prevented heterozygosity loss in the population and actually enhanced gene diversity (GD) significantly by 0.2% and lowered measures of inbreeding by 5.8%.

However, fencing and associated measures may affect landscape esthetics and are sometimes considered costly and unpopular. Therefore fence length is often minimized. We investigated 1) whether short fenced road sections were similarly effective in reducing large mammal-vehicle collisions as long fenced road sections (literature review), and 2) whether fence length influenced large mammal use of underpasses (two field studies). We found that: 1) short fences (=. 5 km road length) had lower (52.7%) and more variable (0-94%) effectiveness in reducing collisions than long fences (>. 5 km) (typically >. 80% reduction); 2) wildlife use of underpasses was highly variable, regardless of fence length (first field study); 3) most highway crossings occurred through isolated underpasses (82%) rather than at grade at fence ends (18%) (second field study); and 4) the proportional use of isolated underpasses (compared to crossings at fence ends) did not increase with longer fence lengths (up to 256 m from underpasses) (second field study). If the primary success parameter is to improve highway safety for humans by reducing collisions with large ungulates, the data suggest fence lengths of at least 5 km. While longer fence lengths do not necessarily guarantee higher wildlife use of underpasses as use varies greatly between locations, wildlife fencing can still improve wildlife use of an individual underpass.","10.1016/j.biocon.2016.02.002","CE","CE_7619",227,0.272335657081786,0.136995594639714,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
7623,2013,"Effects of prescribed burning and mechanical bush clearing on ungulate space use in an African savannah","Restoration Ecology","Savannah ecosystems exhibit constant transitions between states dominated by trees and states dominated by a combination of trees and grasses. Transitions between these states are driven by interactions between fire and herbivory. Bush encroachment (i.e. an increase in the density of woody vegetation) is often caused by anthropogenic disturbance such as climate change, invasive plants, fire control, and livestock practices. As bush encroachment alters the dynamics between fire and herbivory, it may have significant impact on savannah ecosystems. Two of the most common measures to mitigate bush encroachment are prescribed burning and bush clearing by mechanical treatments. We studied the effects of these two mitigation measures on ungulate space use in Lapalala Wilderness, a private conservation area within the Waterberg Biosphere Reserve, northern South Africa. Burning and bush clearing affected both the overall abundance and the species composition of ungulates at particular patches, but these effects were influenced by habitat and the type of bush clearing treatment. Contrary to our expectations, most species occurred less frequently in burnt patches, and also less frequently in patches that had been bush cleared. Our results suggest that combined effects of fire and bush clearing may have positive effects on grazers and negative effects on browsers. Although our sampling design did not allow us to fully resolve interactive effects of burning and bush clearing treatments across habitats, our study highlights the fact that there are complex ecological consequences of habitat alterations in savannah ecosystems. © 2012 Society for Ecological Restoration.","10.1111/j.1526-100X.2012.00877.x","CE","CE_7623",245,0.201613368325711,-0.0675002612662238,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Fleas are the primary vectors of plague, and flea control can stop the spread of plague epizootics and increase Utah prairie dog survival. We evaluated a newly developed grain-bait insecticide treated with the active ingredient imidacloprid. In 2009, we conducted a single application of the product in treatment plots within each of 4 study sites and sampled fleas from captured Utah prairie dogs on treatment and control plots at monthly intervals. We observed mixed results; the product generally was effective at reducing flea prevalence, abundance, and intensity on prairie dogs at some sites and not at others, and the effectiveness within a site varied over time. In 2010, we doubled the amount of bait on treatment plots, yet we still failed to observe a consistent decline in flea prevalence, abundance, and intensity on prairie dogs. At the application rates we evaluated, the imidacloprid product is likely not as effective at controlling fleas on Utah prairie dogs as the more commonly used topical insecticide containing deltamethrin. However, managers should also consider the risk of flea species developing resistance following the repeated application of a single flea-control product. Furthermore, because we observed a higher than expected diversity of flea species (8) on Utah prairie dogs, future work should be undertaken to investigate how other mammalian host species might mediate flea population dynamics, plague ecology, and the outcome of flea management approaches. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/wsb.107","CE","CE_7624",262,0.269239392007454,-0.15408389650349,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

However, there is uncertainty about the generality of a stress response among populations, factors influencing the intensity of the response and the amount of time needed to physiologically acclimatize. We evaluated the relationship of temporal, climatic and social factors to stress hormone concentrations in five African elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations following reintroduction. We determined fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (FGMs) in 1567 fecal samples collected from elephants reintroduced to five fenced reserves with differing reintroduction histories in South Africa during 2000-2006. Variation in FGMs across the five reserves was best explained by the number of years that elapsed since initial release. Compared with FGMs 1 year after release, FGMs were 10% lower 10 years after release and 40% lower 24 years after release. Across all reserves, FGMs were consistently highest in the dry season, although daily and monthly temperature and rainfall were not as important as other factors. FGMs did not vary solely in relationship to reserve size or elephant density. Our findings suggest that regardless of reintroduction site conditions, elephants and likely other species subject to reintroduction require an extended period of time to physiologically acclimatize to their new surroundings.

Conflict between large carnivores and livestock outside the boundaries of wildlife areas frequently results in losses to both livestock and predator populations. The endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus Temminck, 1820) is wide ranging and unrestricted by conventional fences, thereby posing a major challenge to conservation managers. Wild dogs are territorial and communicate residence using scent marks. Simulating the presence of other wild dogs using translocated foreign scent marks may therefore represent a means to manage wild dog ranging behaviour. Aims. To investigate the effectiveness of using targeted scent-mark deployments to signal a wild dog pack to return to their frequented range within the safety of a protected area. Methods. We report on the ranging behaviour of a wild dog pack reintroduced into a wildlife area in Botswana with no recent history of resident wild dogs. We describe daily movements by the free-ranging introduced pack and compare these to moves following targeted deployment of scent marks when the wild dog pack had ranged close to or outside the boundaries of the protected area. Key results. Targeted foreign scent-mark exposure resulted in the pack moving closer to the geometric centre of its range. The mean distance travelled the day after exposure was significantly greater than the distance travelled the previous day and the mean daily distance moved during the study period. Conclusions. Targeted exposure to foreign scent marks proved to be a viable alternative to recapturing dogs that had ranged beyond the boundaries of the wildlife area. Implications. This novel approach to managing free-ranging carnivores utilises biologically relevant signals and holds potential not only for the conservation of African wild dogs, but also for other territorial species. © CSIRO 2012.","10.1071/WR11070","CE","CE_7627",281,0.166272210322865,0.044655203666546,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

To counter these pressures, patrolling and active wildlife enforcement are widely accepted as fundamental conservation strategies. Using the case example of Khao Yai National Park (KYNP) and data from a camera trap survey, we modeled and evaluated the effectiveness of ranger stations in reducing human access and illegal activities, and in increasing prey and predator presence. This type of data and analysis is needed to monitor and evaluate enforcement effectiveness and develop adaptive management strategies. At KYNP, we used camera-trapping data as a proxy to evaluate whether or not a positive impact of ranger stations on wildlife distribution could outweigh edge effects from human disturbance. We assessed factors affecting the distribution of poachers and wildlife using Maxent. Our analysis was based on 217 camera trap locations (6260 trap nights) and suggests that ungulates and poachers persist nearby ranger stations. Rangers should increase patrolling efforts of border areas; however, increasing wildlife patrolling in inaccessible areas with mobile range units may be more effective than establishing more ranger stations along park boundaries. © 2012 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","10.1111/j.1744-7429.2012.00869.x","CE","CE_7632",198,0.217208365820718,0.132093716061377,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Home ranges were 902,107 ha and averaged 460 ha. Using a mixed linear model, I estimated that home-range size decreased with increasing 1) red deer density, 2) supplemental feeding intensity, and 3) average annual temperature; 4) home-range size increased as the distance of main roads from the edge of the home range increased; and 5) males had a larger home range than females (580 ha versus 400 ha). These results were explained by effects of food availability (1, 2, and 3), energy expenditure of an individual (4 and 5), intraspecific interactions (1 and 5), and size of unfragmented habitat patches (4) on home-range size. To my knowledge, this is the 1st large mammal study to explicitly show that the density and spatial distribution of roads and supplemental feeding affect home-range size of red deer and that humans can have a greater impact on home-range size and shape than natural habitat factors. Ungulates are often supplementally fed to increase their value to hunters and to reduce forest damage, particularly in Europe; however, this practice can greatly reduce the home-range size, potentially leading to increased disease transmission and competition associated with the higher deer densities around feeding sites, which can result in just the opposite of what was intended. © 2012 American Society of Mammalogists.",NA,"CE","CE_7633",268,0.174050924589862,0.132690359615592,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
7635,2016,"To protect or neglect? Design, monitoring, and evaluation of a law enforcement strategy to recover small populations of wild tigers and their prey","Biological Conservation","Many remaining wild tiger populations persist in small numbers at sites where densities are less than half of their estimated carrying capacity and will continue to decline if not protected from poaching. Although law enforcement is frequently used to protect tigers and their prey, the conditions under which enforcement is likely to be effective in recovering small populations of wild tigers are not well understood. We evaluated the effectiveness of a law enforcement strategy to recover tigers and their prey in Lao PDR where extensive habitat provided favorable conditions for large increases in tiger numbers if protected from poaching. Over a seven-year period, we monitored along a theory of change to evaluate assumptions about the causal linkages between intermediate results and biological outcomes. Although we found a strong positive correlation between funding for enforcement and days patrolled (rs = 0.786, n = 7, p = 0.05) and a significant negative correlation between days patrolled and overall hunting catch per unit effort (rs = - 0.893,n = 7, p < 0.05), ultimately a proliferation in snaring was associated with decline in several indices of tiger abundance. We conclude that actions were sufficient to reduce poaching and increase prey populations, but insufficient to curtail extirpation of tigers. Recovering small populations of high-value wildlife such as tigers in promising source sites is dependent on establishing a complete enforcement regime, complimentary strategies that build support for the enforcement regime, and a nimble monitoring and evaluation system for agile adaptive management.","10.1016/j.biocon.2016.08.018","CE","CE_7635",236,0.312685812468425,0.129123275456472,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
7638,2014,"Supplemental feeding alters migration of a temperate ungulate","Ecological Applications","Conservation of migration requires information on behavior and environmental determinants. The spatial distribution of forage resources, which migration exploits, often are altered and may have subtle, unintended consequences. Supplemental feeding is a common management practice, particularly for ungulates in North America and Europe, and carryover effects on behavior of this anthropogenic manipulation of forage are expected in theory, but have received limited empirical evaluation, particularly regarding effects on migration. We used global positioning system (GPS) data to evaluate the influence of winter feeding on migration behavior of 219 adult female elk (Cervus elaphus) from 18 fed ranges and 4 unfed ranges in western Wyoming. Principal component analysis revealed that the migratory behavior of fed and unfed elk differed in distance migrated, and the timing of arrival to, duration on, and departure from summer range. Fed elk migrated 19.2 km less, spent 11 more days on stopover sites, arrived to summer range 5 days later, resided on summer range 26 fewer days, and departed in the autumn 10 days earlier than unfed elk. Time-to-event models indicated that differences in migratory behavior between fed and unfed elk were caused by altered sensitivity to the environmental drivers of migration. In spring, unfed elk migrated following plant green-up closely, whereas fed elk departed the feedground but lingered on transitional range, thereby delaying their arrival to summer range. In autumn, fed elk were more responsive to low temperatures and precipitation events, causing earlier departure from summer range than unfed elk. Overall, supplemental feeding disconnected migration by fed elk from spring green-up and decreased time spent on summer range, thereby reducing access to quality forage. Our findings suggest that ungulate migration can be substantially altered by changes to the spatial distribution of resources, including those of anthropogenic origin, and that management practices applied in one season may have unintended behavioral consequences in subsequent seasons.","10.1890/13-2092.1","CE","CE_7638",304,0.218260551347051,-0.000195724619645015,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
7649,2011,"Effects of predator treatments, individual traits, and environment on moose survival in Alaska","Journal of Wildlife Management","We studied moose (Alces alces) survival, physical condition, and abundance in a 3-predator system in western Interior Alaska, USA, during 2001-2007. Our objective was to quantify the effects of predator treatments on moose population dynamics by investigating changes in survival while evaluating the contribution of potentially confounding covariates. In May 2003 and 2004, we reduced black bear (Ursus americanus) and brown bear (U. arctos) numbers by translocating bears =240 km from the study area. Aircraft-assisted take reduced wolf (Canis lupus) numbers markedly in the study area during 2004-2007. We estimated black bears were reduced by approximately 96% by June 2004 and recovered to within 27% of untreated numbers by May 2007. Brown bears were reduced approximately 50% by June 2004. Late-winter wolf numbers were reduced by 75% by 2005 and likely remained at these levels through 2007. In addition to predator treatments, moose hunting closures during 2004-2007 reduced harvests of male moose by 60% in the study area. Predator treatments resulted in increased calf survival rates during summer (primarily from reduced black bear predation) and autumn (primarily from reduced wolf predation). Predator treatments had little influence on survival of moose calves during winter; instead, calf survival was influenced by snow depth and possibly temperature. Increased survival of moose calves during summer and autumn combined with relatively constant winter survival in most years led to a corresponding increase in annual survival of calves following predator treatments. Nonpredation mortalities of calves increased following predator treatments; however, this increase provided little compensation to the decrease in predation mortalities resulting from treatments. Thus, predator-induced calf mortality was primarily additive. Summer survival of moose calves was positively related to calf mass (ß > 0.07, SE = 0.073) during treated years and lower (ß = -0.82, SE = 0.247) for twins than singletons during all years. Following predator treatments, survival of yearling moose increased 8.7% for females and 21.4% for males during summer and 2.2% for females and 15.6% for males during autumn. Annual survival of adult (=2 yr old) female moose also increased in treated years and was negatively (ß = -0.21, SE = 0.078) related to age. Moose density increased 45%, from 0.38 moose/km2 in 2001 to 0.55 moose/km2 in 2007, which resulted from annual increases in overall survival of moose, not increases in reproductive rates. Indices of nutritional status remained constant throughout our study despite increased moose density. This information can be used by wildlife managers and policymakers to better understand the outcomes of predator treatments in Alaska and similar environments.

7653,2014,"Coyote removal, understory cover, and survival of white-tailed deer neonates","Journal of Wildlife Management","Predation by coyotes (Canis latrans) on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) neonates has led to reduced recruitment in many deer populations in southeastern North America. This low recruitment combined with liberal antlerless deer harvest has resulted in declines in some deer populations, and consequently, increased interest in coyote population control. We investigated whether neonate survival increased after coyote removal, whether coyote predation on neonates was additive to other mortality sources, and whether understory vegetation density affected neonate survival. We monitored neonate survival for 4 years prior to (2006-2009) and 3 years during (2010-2012) intensive coyote removal on 3 32-km2 units on the United States Department of Energy's Savannah River Site, South Carolina. We removed 474 coyotes (1.63 coyotes/km2 per unit per year), reducing coyote abundance by 78% from pre-removal levels. The best model (wi = 0.927) describing survival probability among 216 radio-collared neonates included a within-year quadratic time trend variable, date of birth, removal treatment, and a varying removal year effect. Under this model, survival differed between pre-treatment and removal periods and it differed among years during the removal period, being >100% greater than pre-treatment survival (0.228) during the first removal year (0.513), similar to pre-treatment survival during the second removal year (0.202), and intermediate during the third removal year (0.431). Despite an initial increase, the overall effect of coyote removal on neonate survival was modest. Mortality rate attributable to coyote predation was lowest during the first removal year (0.357) when survival was greatest, but the mortality rate from all other causes did not differ between the pre-treatment period and any year during removals, indicating that coyote predation acted as an additive source of mortality. Survival probability was not related to vegetation cover, either directly or in interaction with coyote abundance. When the objective is to increase the recruitment of white-tailed deer, we conclude that neither coyote control nor vegetation management appear effective. Reduction of the antlerless harvest may be necessary to meet this objective, but this harvest strategy warrants additional research in Southeastern deer populations. Published 2014.

7657,2011,"Beehive fences as effective deterrents for crop-raiding elephants: field trials in northern Kenya","African Journal of Ecology","Increasing elephant populations in Kenya since 1989 have been widely praised as a conservation success story. However, where elephants and agricultural land overlap, incidents of human-elephant conflict are on the increase. Wildlife managers and farmers are now trying different farm-based deterrents to keep elephants out of crops. Here, we present data on the effectiveness of a novel beehive fence deployed in a Turkana community of 62 communally run farms in Kenya. Specifically, 1700m of beehive fences semi-surrounded the outer boundaries of seventeen farms, and we compared elephant farm invasion events with these and to seventeen neighbouring farms whose boundaries were 'protected' only by thorn bush barriers. We present data from 45 farm invasions, or attempted invasions, recorded over 2years. Thirteen groups of elephants approached the beehive fences and turned away. Of the 32 successful farm invasions, only one bull elephant broke through the beehive fences. These results demonstrate that beehive fences are more effective than thorn bush barriers at deterring elephants and may have a role to play in alleviating farmer-elephant conflict. Additionally, the harvesting of 106kg of honey during the trial period suggests that beehive fences may also improve crop production and enhance rural livelihoods through honey sales. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/j.1365-2028.2011.01275.x","CE","CE_7657",202,0.214654188513976,0.138361340821726,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
7662,2013,"Is electric fencing an efficient and animal-friendly tool to prevent stone martens from entering buildings?","European Journal of Wildlife Research","Wildlife such as stone martens Martes foina have adapted to live in urban areas, which are spreading worldwide. Conflicts with humans can arise when martens enter buildings and cause serious damage to roof insulation. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for measures that will reduce such human-wildlife conflicts. Data we collected from a big insurance company regarding the costs of repairs of damages caused by martens revealed an estimate of 655 annual cases per Mio inhabitants and pay-outs of approximately 200,000 per year from 2002 to 2006. The data collected from pest control organisations showed an increase of damage claims from around 20 up to 150 cases per year in the last 20 years. In an experimental case study, the analysis of video recordings (26 nights) and long-term bait controls (103 nights) showed that installed electric wires and woven wire mesh prevented martens from entering a building they previously used intensively. Our results suggest that electric fencing could be a simple, short-termed measure to exclude martens from buildings before definitively sealing the openings. Electric fencing needs further quantitative and qualitative evaluation at different study sites to develop an animal-friendly, practical and cost-effective tool that prevents martens from causing damage to roof insulations. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s10344-013-0752-5","CE","CE_7662",203,0.249261939106876,-0.0855063658100182,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Small- to medium-sized mammals are declining in both distribution and density across large tracts of northern Australia's tropical savannas, including within protected areas. The most likely causes are a combination of changed fire patterns, the impacts of introduced herbivores and predation by feral cats. Here, in contrast to the prevailing trend across northern Australia, we report the recovery of native mammals in response to a large-scale (>40000ha) destocking experiment carried out at Mornington Wildlife Sanctuary in the central Kimberley, north-west Australia. Following the removal of introduced herbivores from 2004, the species richness and abundance of small native rodents and dasyurids increased significantly across all sampled habitats over the next 3years.

In East Africa, projects are fortifying bomas to reduce large carnivore conflicts with the specific goal of preventing the indiscriminate killing of lions. A lack of evidence-based studies evaluating the impact of these efforts means their efficacy for lion conservation is not yet scientifically verifiable. We evaluated fortified bomas by comparing large carnivore attack rates at 84 unprotected bomas and 62 fortified bomas called Living Walls. The latter were 99.9 % successful in preventing nighttime carnivore attacks over 1,790 boma-months. Following Living Wall installation, there were no lion deaths at fortified bomas. Our results demonstrate the importance of predator-proof enclosures as a tool for lion conservation across the continent in areas where they inhabit humanand livestockdominated landscapes.

7686,2016,"Do nest boxes in restored woodlands promote the conservation of hollow-dependent fauna?","Restoration Ecology","Vegetation restoration is considered as an important strategy for reversing biodiversity decline in agricultural areas. However, revegetated areas often lack key vegetation attributes like large old hollow-bearing trees. As these trees take a long time to develop, artificial cavities such as nest boxes are sometimes provided to address lag effects. We conducted a 3-year experiment using 150 nest boxes with 4 designs to quantify patterns of occupancy within 16 replanted areas and 14 patches of remnant old-growth eucalypt woodland. We quantified patterns of occupancy of nest boxes in physically connected versus isolated remnants and plantings, and multiple covariate effects on nest box occupancy at the nest box, tree, patch, and landscape levels. Our analyses revealed a lower probability of nest box occupancy within remnants (vs. plantings) for 2 of the 6 response variables examined: any species and the Feral Honeybee. Nest boxes in connected remnants and plantings were more likely to be occupied than those in isolated plantings and remnants by any mammal and the Common Brushtail Possum. Nest boxes in restored woodlands are used by some hollow-dependent fauna but principally already common species and not taxa of conservation concern. Nest boxes were also used by pest species. A key management consideration must be to create connected habitat to facilitate colonization of nest boxes by mammals. Approximately 15% of the cavity-dependent vertebrates within the study area used next boxes, possibly because the diverse requirements of the array of other species were not met by the range of nest boxes deployed.","10.1111/rec.12306","CE","CE_7686",247,0.181954214641585,-0.0363189197263744,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
7688,2011,"Guidelines for large herbivore translocation simplified: black rhinoceros case study","Journal of Applied Ecology","1. Most hypotheses for translocation success are elaborate, hierarchical, and untested combinations of socio-ecological predictors. Empirical support for those tested is vulnerable to spurious single-predictor relationships and does not account for the hierarchy amongst predictors and non-independence amongst individuals or cohorts. Testing hypotheses as a priori multi-level models promotes stronger inference. 2. We apply a 25-year (1981-2005) data base including 89 reintroduction and 102 restocking events that released 682 black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis into 81 reserves to test 24 hypotheses for translocation success, defined as survival to 1year post-release. We made information-theoretic comparisons of hypotheses represented as hierarchical models incorporating random effects for reserve and release cohort predictors of death. 3. Mortality rates after restocking were higher than for reintroductions (13·4 cf. 7·9%, respectively) due largely to intraspecific fighting. No predictors strongly influenced reintroduction success, although cohorts consisting entirely of adult males were 8·2% of individuals but contributed 21·9% of deaths, and reserves with lowest carrying capacities (i.e. <0·1rhinokm-2) had a 16·3% mortality rate. Most models for restocking success were not supported. Only those including age class received substantial support. Age was the only predictor to strongly influence death rates. Predictors previously thought influential, like population density, reserve area and quality, and cohort size, were not supported. 4. Synthesis and applications. Simple rules succeeded where complex ecological and demographic hypotheses failed to predict survival after translocation of critically endangered black rhinoceros. Results support bold attempts by managers at translocations towards species recovery in most ways that they have historically occurred. Groups of rhinoceros of different size and composition can be successfully moved over large distances between different ecological contexts. Also, the release of cohorts into reserves that are relatively small, poorer habitat or already stocked need not be avoided so long as calves and all-male cohorts are not reintroduced, and only adults used for restocking. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of information-theoretic comparisons of a priori hierarchical models to test hypotheses for conservation management.

Starting in 1985, individuals were brought from western zoos to two centers in China and breeding programs were initiated. With the increasing size of captive populations, two reintroduction projects were launched in the northwestern China in 2001 and 2010. Knowledge on genetic diversity in China's horse populations is limited, but would help improve the genetic management and assess the success of the reintroduction. Accordingly, one reintroduced and two captive populations were examined with 10 microsatellite loci together with pedigree data. The results showed higher level of diversity within the captive populations than the reintroduced population, indicating some alleles may have been lost during reintroduction. Genetic differentiation was detected among populations (FST=0.09±0.05, RhoST=0.05±0.02) and Bayesian clustering supported the presence of three subpopulations. The highest genetic differentiation was observed between the captive and reintroduced populations, and inbreeding coefficients were generally higher in the reintroduced population. Temporal estimates of both pedigree and microsatellite data showed a high, but decreasing level inbreeding. Through simulations, we estimated that the reintroduced population needs more than 100 individuals to retain approximately 90% of its current, already depauperate, genetic diversity.

The original distribution of aoudads includes several countries in the North of Africa, but it has been introduced, for trophy-hunting purposes, into other countries (USA, Mexico and Spain). The species was declared vulnerable in the 2012 IUCN's Red List and is also included in the CITES II Appendix. Surprisingly, little is known about its conservation status or the reproductive biology of the natural populations. There are some reports of the application of basic assisted-reproduction techniques in captive aoudads. In this preliminary study, we explored the feasibility of implementing assisted reproduction procedures in captive aoudad females using non-traditional techniques for in vivo embryo production. This approach was used to obtain the best results using the minimum possible number of animals. Three aoudad females were synchronized using a domestic sheep protocol and subcutaneous osmotic pumps for the delivery of follicle-stimulating hormone. A mini-surgical approach combined with laparoscopy was performed to obtain in vivo-produced embryos. All females had an ovulatory response of more than three corporea lutea, but only five good quality morulae were obtained from one female. Those were cryopreserved by vitrification using a Cryotop®. In conclusion, our approach was successful in obtaining in vivo embryos using a limited number of females.

In human-altered landscapes, we may expect that reintroduced species affect taxa already present. In Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise National Park (central Apennines, Italy), a 30% decline in the abundance of 'vulnerable' Apennine chamois (2005: c. 650 individuals, 2010: c. 450 individuals) has been recorded, whereas red deer (reintroduced in 1972-1987: 81 individuals) have greatly increased (2010: >2500 individuals). We investigated space and diet overlaps between red deer and Apennine chamois, and their effects on foraging behaviour of the latter. We also compared the composition of grasslands with that recorded when the former were absent. In 2010-2011, we found out: (1) a great space (>75%) and diet (>90%) overlap between deer and chamois; (2) a significant increase of unpalatable plant species and a decreasing trend of the nutritious, most grazed species by chamois, in respect to when deer were absent; (3) irrespective from vegetation type, a significantly reduced bite rate of adult female chamois in patches used also by deer, compared with areas without deer. Our results suggest a negative effect of red deer on the availability of nutritious plant species in summer-autumn, possibly because of grazing and physical damage on the grassland caused by trampling. Environmental conditions and access to high-quality forage in the warm season influence the winter survival of offspring of mountain ungulates. Our results indicate that interspecific overlap in resource use with an increasing, reintroduced population can threaten rare taxa.

Attempts to measure the impact of commercial thinning on northern flying squirrels have mostly addressed short-term effects (2-5. years post-thinning) and the few published studies of longer-term results have been contradictory. We measured densities of northern flying squirrels 11-13. years after thinning of young (55-65. years) Douglas-fir forest stands in the Cascade Range of Oregon, as part of the Young Stand Thinning & Diversity Study. The study includes four replicate blocks, each consisting of an unthinned control stand and one stand each of the following thinning treatments: Heavy Thin; Light Thin; and Light Thin with Gaps. Thinning decreased density of northern flying squirrels, and squirrel densities were significantly lower in heavily thinned stands than in more lightly thinned stands. Regression analysis revealed a strong positive relationship of flying squirrel density with density of large (>30. cm diameter) standing dead trees and a negative relationship with percent cover of low understory shrubs. Maintaining sufficient area and connectivity of dense, closed canopy forest is recommended as a strategy to assure that long-term goals of promoting late-seral structure do not conflict with short-term habitat requirements of this important species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.foreco.2011.09.043","CE","CE_7722",241,0.202894794330157,0.0666899534172864,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
7727,2014,"Fencing protected areas: a long-term assessment of the effects of reserve establishment and fencing on African mammalian diversity","Biological Conservation","Conservation of biodiversity is one of the great challenges faced by present societies. Establishment and fencing of protected areas to isolate biodiversity from human activities is one of the most popular methods for achieving this protection. Here we analyze two long-term (~50. years) datasets on a diverse mammal community of 38 regularly occurring species including many of international conservation importance such as the rare, endemic mountain bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci), the black rhino (Diceros bicornis), the elephant (Loxodonta africana), and the lion (Panthera leo). These data were collected in two different locations within a flagship protected area in East Africa. Our primary objective was to investigate patterns of wildlife populations and diversity before and after the installation of a perimeter electric fence. We find strong evidence for long-term human-induced edge effects at the site that is closest to the border of the protected area (Treetops); this site registered the strongest losses in total wildlife population numbers, aggregate wildlife biomass, and species richness. In contrast, wildlife populations at the site farther away from the edge of the protected area (The Ark) have remained relatively stable over the duration of the dataset. Our data reveal clear differentiation in the temporal changes of wildlife populations between the two sites. Establishment of the fence in 1989 led to temporary increases in wildlife populations near the park margins, but since the late 1990s these gains have been reversed and wildlife populations have continued to decline near the edge of the reserve. Without the intention of undermining the potential value of fences as conservation tools, our data suggest that fences are only as effective as the management and enforcement efforts that accompany them. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2014.05.023","CE","CE_7727",279,0.142942539125197,0.226065962808319,"300","neutral","neutral_300",1

We collected primary data on 12 European ground squirrel reintroduction projects carried out at 14 localities in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland since 1989. We focused on seven methodological aspects of each reintroduction: selection of release site, method of releasing, date of releasing, origin of released animals, total number of released animals, mean number of released animals per season and reintroduction site management. The method of releasing was found to be the key factor in determining the settlement of animals at the target locality. Only soft releasing methods, i. e. the use of enclosures and/or artificial burrows, ensure that animals remain at the target locality. The other factors significantly determining reintroduction success are the number of released animals per season (at least 23 animals required) and the total number of released animals (a minimum of 60 individuals). Long-term management of the site and regular monitoring of the newly established population are necessary. Our recommendations, based on experience with the successes and failures of previous reintroductions, could largely improve the efficiency of future reintroductions of highly endangered species. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s10344-011-0597-8","CE","CE_7731",205,0.0708522101265369,0.153506756308503,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
7734,2013,"Are declines of an endangered mammal predation-driven, and can a captive-breeding and release program aid their recovery?","Journal of Zoology","Declines of imperiled small mammals are often attributed to predation without investigating the relative influence of survival and reproductive parameters on population growth. Accordingly, declines in the endangered Key Largo woodrat Neotoma floridana smalli (KLWR) population have been attributed to predation by feral cats Felis catus, Burmese pythons Python molurus bivittatus and raccoons Procyon lotor. We estimated survival, recruitment and realized population growth rates from four capture-mark-recapture studies to determine if the pattern of demographic variation was consistent with predation as the primary cause of KLWR declines. Additionally, we evaluated the KLWR captive-breeding and release program by comparing survival of captive-born and released KLWRs to wild-born KLWRs. The realized population growth rate of wild-born KLWRs had a strong pattern of covariation with recruitment; covariation between the realized population growth rate and apparent survival was negligible. Consistent with demographic theory, our results suggest that KLWR population dynamics were driven primarily by variation in recruitment, and that periodic reductions in recruitment led to population declines. We found that the survival curve and the first month (S1) and first 3-month (S1-3) survival estimates for the wild-born KLWRs [S1 = 0.929 (0.890-0.968); S1-3 = 0.942 (0.919-0.965)] were considerably higher ( 2 = 33.9, 1 d.f., P < 0.001) than released KLWRs [S1 = 0.521 (0.442-0.600); S1-3 = 0.561 (0.493-0.629)]. Low survival rates from predation limited the success of the captive-breeding and release program. This study illustrates the importance of pre-release conditioning of captive-bred animals and the importance of considering reproductive parameters in conjunction with survival estimates to understand the drivers of population decline.© 2013 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/jzo.12046","CE","CE_7734",256,0.210055540293176,0.136866429447699,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
7736,2016,"Experimental habitat restoration for conserved species using ecosystem engineers and vegetation management","Animal Conservation","We experimentally address the theoretical potential for managing ecosystem engineer species to support suites of species in degraded habitats. Historically, the ecosystem engineer California ground squirrel Otospermophilus beecheyi supported a grassland food web through widespread burrowing activity. Currently, ground squirrels are not a threatened species, but like many other ecosystem engineers, they exist at densities too low to fulfill their engineering role in many locations. Our objective was to implement short-term treatments, including squirrel translocation, to re-establish key ecological processes on protected reserve lands. We manipulated vegetation and squirrels in a replicated, large-scale field experiment for 2 years, and monitored through a third year. Vegetation mowing and soil decompaction treatments reduced grass density and thatch depth. Squirrel translocation accelerated squirrel settlement and activity in target sites. Of the more than 1000 burrow entrances remaining through the third year, nearly all burrows were concentrated in the plots that received squirrel translocation. We found significant additive effects of squirrel translocation and vegetation management on the spatial footprint of squirrel activity. Noteworthy and persistent engineering effects were achieved through squirrel activity, and both vegetation management and squirrel re-establishment were needed to stimulate squirrel activity. The overarching goal of this experiment was to provide conservation managers with a cost-effective tool for restoring degraded habitats to a hybrid ecosystem state with improved suitability for species of conservation concern, in this case, the western burrowing owl Athene cunicularia hypugaea.","10.1111/acv.12266","CE","CE_7736",236,0.234423342550604,0.20147130366451,"250","neutral","neutral_250",1

However, restorations are often limited in space or time, and we know little on whether and how restoration and management affect vertebrates. Here we assessed the local and landscape-scale effects of habitat restoration and management on small-mammal communities in the Egyek-Pusztakócs marsh system (Hortobágy National Park, Hungary), site of the largest active restoration of grasslands on former croplands in Europe. We live-trapped mice, voles and shrews in spring and autumn in 2 years (four sampling periods) at two sites in six habitat types: croplands, grasslands restored 3-6 years earlier and natural grasslands. Data on 421 individuals of 12 species showed that restored grasslands were similar to croplands and natural grasslands in species richness, abundance and composition. At the local scale, management influenced abundance because there were more small mammals in unmanaged and early-mown grasslands with taller vegetation than in late-mown or grazed grasslands with lower vegetation, or in ploughed croplands. Elevation was also important because sites at higher elevation provided refuges during spring floods or summer droughts. At the landscape scale, the proportion of restored and natural grasslands positively affected the abundance of small mammals, whereas the proportion of linear habitats (roads, canals) had a negative effect on abundance. Our results show that management is more important than restoration per se at the local scale, which is expected for habitat generalists such as small mammals in contrast to specialists such as plant-feeding invertebrates. However, restoration provides landscape-scale benefits by increasing the area of grasslands that can serve as refuges for small mammals in unfavourable periods. We thus conclude that a mosaic of restored and appropriately managed grasslands with tall vegetation will provide the best chances for the persistence of small-mammal communities in dynamic landscapes.","10.1111/acv.12191","CE","CE_7742",301,0.186643499242524,0.280920045786164,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Evidence of the intended and unintended effects of feeding wild ungulates","Journal of Wildlife Management","Ungulate populations are important natural resources, associated with both costs and benefits. Conflicts have arisen between stakeholders who benefit from high ungulate numbers and those faced with the costs. Supplementary or diversionary feeding may potentially mitigate conflicts while maintaining harvest yields but can have conservation implications. We quantified the empirical evidence for whether the intended effects, and hence management goals, of feeding are met. We also examined whether any potential unintended consequences of feeding occur and under what conditions. We found clear evidence that supplementary feeding enhanced reproduction and population growth under certain conditions. By contrast, we found limited evidence of the effectiveness of diversionary feeding to protect crops, forestry, and natural habitats, with positive effects often undermined by increases in ungulate density. However, the use of diversionary feeding to reduce traffic collisions seems promising but requires further investigation. The unintended effects of feeding are typically complex, involving changes to demography, behavior, and vegetation with consequent cascading effects on other trophic levels, as well as exacerbated risks of disease transmission. Increased ungulate density is the primary driver behind these unintended effects, the consequences of which tend to increase with longevity of feeding and affect a range of stakeholders. We urge managers to take seriously the risks as well as the economic and ethical issues before deciding to feed ungulates.","10.1002/jwmg.798","CE","CE_7748",219,0.316620687173759,0.244456498812025,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Radio-tracking was used to follow the fate of 60 released brown hares over a 4-year period, extending between November 2005 and November 2009. The survival rate among these animals after 12 months was estimated to be 37 %, with 22 tagged individuals surviving beyond 1 year post-release.

There was no significant relationship between body mass and mortality rate in the first month following release. A natural cause of death was predation by mammals, which accounted for some 31 % of all losses. Remaining causes were poaching (13 %), hits by vehicles (7 %) and unidentified causes (9 %).

However, the consequences of such management on non-target species are frequently neglected and unknown. This study examines the effects of traditional management practices of scrubland clearance by controlled burning to improve menaced carnivores on non-target species: rodent and insectivores in Doñana National Park (SW of Iberian Peninsula). We used capture-recapture methods to examine changes in abundance in areas that were burnt one and three years ago, compared with unburnt areas. Results showed that burnt areas had higher species abundances, but mainly on the ecotonal boundaries. Species abundances showed dramatic seasonal differences with high abundances in autumn and winter, and very low abundance in summer. Our study revealed that scrubland management by controlled fires increases the abundance of small mammal species, mainly Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus. We found only four small mammal species between the different treatments. However, some species that were formerly abundant in Doñana, such as Elyomis quercinus, were found only in burnt areas. Our results suggest that controlled burning is not contributing to the current loss of biotic diversity in this community. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.",NA,"CE","CE_7755",193,0.292540949067153,0.143559245346472,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Five locally-extinct mammal species and one reptile species were reintroduced into a fenced Reserve where cats, foxes and rabbits were excluded. Reintroductions of the nationally threatened greater stick-nest rat, burrowing bettong, greater bilby and western barred bandicoot were all considered successful based on short and medium-term success criteria. These criteria included continued survival after 8. years, increased distribution across the large Reserve and, most importantly, recovery after a drought event. The trial reintroductions of the numbat and woma python into the Reserve were unsuccessful due to predation by native avian and reptilian predators respectively. Outside the Reserve, where cats and foxes were present but controlled through poison baiting, reintroduction attempts of the greater bilby and burrowing bettong were unsuccessful. High mortality was attributed to cat and fox predation with dingoes also contributing to post-release mortality in bettongs. However, a reintroduction of burrowing bettongs into a fenced area with low rabbit and cat abundance has, to-date, met short-term and medium-term success criteria. Results suggest that the absence or severe restriction of exotic mammalian predators was the critical factor responsible for the success of the mammal reintroductions.

In each plot, a nest box specially designed to harbor dormice was attached to the trunk or branch of a tree. All living trees in the microhabitat around nest boxes were recorded and categorized into 3 resource types: food, nesting materials, and other resources. We then incorporated a generalized linear model to determine how resource types affected the frequency of nest box use by dormice. A positive correlation was observed between the frequency of nest box use and abundance of trees of lower strata that were used as food resources. On the other hand, the abundance of trees categorized as other resources was negatively correlated with the frequency of nest box use. These findings suggest that dormouse resting site preference is influenced mainly by the abundance of food resources in the microhabitat.","10.3106/041.039.0104","CE","CE_7768",183,0.18005712662431,0.13725544934801,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Protected areas are an essential conservation tool to limit biodiversity loss, but their efficiency have yet to be proven. Here, we used camera-trap data on the presence of medium and large-size vertebrates in a protected area (Cantão State Park) and a neighbouring private forest reserve (Santa Fé Ranch) to evaluate their effectiveness in protecting biodiversity. We also gathered information on seasonality and activity patterns. A total sampling effort of 7929 trap-nights revealed a diverse vertebrate fauna in the region. A total of 34 mammal species, belonging to 8 different orders was detected in the study area, some of which have a high level of conservation interest and value. The photographic index showed that diversity was more abundant outside the protected area of Cantão State Park, where seasonality could play a major role in vertebrate occurrence. Overall, the influence of seasonality on distribution appears to be species-specific. During the wet season around 40% of the common species were not detected inside the park, whereas in Santa Fé Ranch most species (62.5%) suffered only a slight decrease in relative abundance probably due to changes in the availability of food resources.

We translocated 74 Gunnison's prairie dogs from 1 source colony in downtown Flagstaff, Arizona (urban) and 75 from 1 source colony in lower density housing outside the city (suburban) to 2 abandoned, recipient colonies on open grasslands 50 km north of the city (wildland). We released animals into uncaged, pre-existing burrow entrances (hard release) or into temporary cages over pre-existing burrow entrances (soft release). We captured 15 (10%) marked animals 1 year post-translocation at the 2 recipient colonies, 7 from soft release treatments and 8 from hard release treatments but visual surveys indicated a minimum of 57 adult prairie dogs and 76 pups present. Adult prairie dogs in all photographs taken by automated cameras placed at burrow entrances at each recipient colony had ear tags, suggesting that most animals at these colonies were survivors from translocation and that survival was likely higher than 10%. By 1 year post-release, recipient colonies occupied an area roughly 9-18 times that of source colonies. Urban Gunnison's prairie dogs can be successfully translocated to abandoned wildland colonies without using soft release methods, but animals may disperse widely.

However, the creation of hard edges around reserve boundaries where conflicts with humans arise and disturbance from human activities inside the reserves may affect carnivore behaviour and ecology. Thailand's largest protected area, Kaeng Krachan National Park (2915 km2) receives >100,000 visitors annually while maintaining an intact assemblage of prey species for large carnivores, making it a potentially important site for population recovery of leopards (Panthera pardus), tigers (Panthera tigris) and dholes (Cuon alpinus). We assessed the abundance of leopards and their prey base, and their response to changes in levels of human activity after an unexpected flooding event that resulted in the park being closed to visitors for >6 months. Using camera-traps, we identified 6 individual leopards and used spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods, incorporating humans and prey as covariates, to test for factors affecting the detection probability of leopards before and after the park closure. Leopard density was unchanged between the two periods, however the movement and activity patterns were clearly different. In the absence of tourist activity, leopards tended to move more frequently, leopard detection rates increased by 70% and activity shifted towards being more diurnal. The consequences of these changes in behaviour may include improved health, reproduction and survival. A management strategy involving seasonal closure of parks may serve to alleviate pressure on leopards and other carnivores.

Of 28 wolves found dead, 65 % were killed by vehicles, 25 % were poached, and 7 % died because of diseases and natural factors. All road casualties were young wolves, most of them male (67 %), hit on roads on average 11.6 km from the centre of the nearest pack. The re-colonisation of WPL started from jump dispersal, which allowed wolves to establish packs in distant locations. As the recovery proceeded, the dispersal pattern shifted to being stratified, a mixture of diffusion and jump dispersal that resulted in the creation of packs in close vicinity to existing groups. After 12 years of re-colonisation, wolves in Western Poland occupied about 30 % of potential suitable habitats.","10.1007/s13364-016-0263-3","CE","CE_7778",278,0.146084808940426,0.0257966499427335,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Here we present genetic assessment of the translocation of golden bandicoots (Isoodon auratus) from a large source population on Barrow Island off the north-west coast of Western Australia to two other island sites and a mainland fenced enclosure. We assessed the genetic diversity of animals translocated to each site and their wild-born progeny, and whether wild-born animals showed evidence of genetic bottlenecks or genetic drift from the source population. Encouragingly, we found no significant loss of genetic diversity in any of the wild-born populations compared to the source population and no significant increase in inbreeding or relatedness amongst wild-born individuals compared to founder populations two years post-translocation. However, we detected an approximately 10-fold reduction in effective population size between founding and wild-born populations. We found no apparent differentiation between wild-born populations and the original source population, or between wild-born animals and their respective founders. Population viability modeling predicts that each of the translocated populations is susceptible to loss of genetic diversity over time. Taken together these results suggest that the golden bandicoot reintroduction program has been initially successful as a result of large founding sizes and high reproductive rates; however, ongoing augmentation will be required to prevent genetic erosion and maintain evolutionary potential in the long-term. © 2014.","10.1016/j.biocon.2014.01.012","CE","CE_7783",254,0.24866887857759,0.0981785550690191,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the palatability of a molasses-based bait for oral delivery of BCG to white-tailed deer. Relevant practical properties of the bait such as physical stability under various environmental conditions were evaluated, as well as palatability. Captive deer consumed baits within 3 h of introduction during 48 of 50 trials. Digital game cameras revealed consumption of all placed baits by one deer over 62 % of the time. Addition of BCG vaccine did not negatively impact palatability. Physical stability analysis demonstrated that ice and water significantly reduced bait stability as measured with a compression assay.

Of these collisions, >50% occur on United States Highway 1 (US 1), the primary roadway connecting the islands in the Florida Keys, USA. The DVCs on the 5.6-km section of US 1 on Big Pine Key are responsible for approximately 26% of annual Key deer mortality, but extensive urban development along this highway segment complicates efforts to reduce DVCs using traditional methods (e.g., fencing, underpasses). In 2002, a continuous 2.6-km system of 2.4-m fencing, 2 underpasses, and 4 experimental deer guards was completed. We evaluated the long-term effectiveness of these highway improvements in reducing DVCs within an urban landscape. Deer used the underpasses all 7 postconstruction years (2003-2009) with dramatic increases in use over the course of the project. Roadway fencing largely eliminated deer intrusion onto the fenced area of US 1. Although well-maintained fencing effectively restricted deer movement onto the fenced section of US 1 (73-100% decline), other sections of US 1 experienced increases in DVCs. Overall, highway improvements along the US 1 corridor were effective in reducing Key deer mortality over the long-term. The success of deer guards in preventing deer access into the fenced section of US 1 supported the feasibility of implementing similar wildlife exclusion projects in other urban areas. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/wsb.45","CE","CE_7788",214,0.242201828231065,0.132724237748931,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Accumulation of understory shrubs makes forests vulnerable to catastrophic fire and can impact animal use, whereas fire prescription can ameliorate negative impacts of suppression. We used radiotelemetry to determine patterns of habitat use and survival of Mexican fox squirrels (Sciurus nayaritensis chiricahuae) in fire-suppressed and fire-prescribed areas of the Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona. Core areas of squirrels within fire-suppressed areas were larger and contained more understory shrubs than core areas of squirrels in fire-prescribed areas. Shrub cover and canopy heterogeneity influenced core-area size and distance traveled, and squirrels that were depredated traveled farther than conspecifics that survived, but shrub cover and canopy heterogeneity were not directly associated with squirrel survival. Suppression-induced increases in understory vegetation might force squirrels to travel greater distances to meet energetic requirements and thereby increase predation risk.

7793,2016,"Rabbit biocontrol and landscape-scale recovery of threatened desert mammals","Conservation Biology","Funding for species conservation is insufficient to meet the current challenges facing global biodiversity, yet many programs use expensive single-species recovery actions and neglect broader management that addresses threatening processes. Arid Australia has the world's worst modern mammalian extinction record, largely attributable to competition from introduced herbivores, particularly European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and predation by feral cats (Felis catus) and foxes (Vulpes vulpes). The biological control agent rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) was introduced to Australia in 1995 and resulted in dramatic, widespread rabbit suppression. We compared the area of occupancy and extent of occurrence of 4 extant species of small mammals before and after RHDV outbreak, relative to rainfall, sampling effort, and rabbit and predator populations. Despite low rainfall during the first 14 years after RHDV, 2 native rodents listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the dusky hopping-mouse (Notomys fuscus) and plains mouse (Pseudomys australis), increased their extent of occurrence by 241-365%. A threatened marsupial micropredator, the crest-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda), underwent a 70-fold increase in extent of occurrence and a 20-fold increase in area of occupancy. Both bottom-up and top-down trophic effects were attributed to RHDV, namely decreased competition for food resources and declines in rabbit-dependent predators. Based on these sustained increases, these 3 previously threatened species now qualify for threat-category downgrading on the IUCN Red List. These recoveries are on a scale rarely documented in mammals and give impetus to programs aimed at targeted use of RHDV in Australia, rather than simply employing top-down threat-based management of arid ecosystems. Conservation programs that take big-picture approaches to addressing threatening processes over large spatial scales should be prioritized to maximize return from scarce conservation funding. Further, these should be coupled with long-term ecological monitoring, a critical tool in detecting and understanding complex ecosystem change.","10.1111/cobi.12684","CE","CE_7793",304,0.163990673644466,0.0199521311123269,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Adult female wolverines were significantly less exposed to illegal killing and this allowed the population to more than double in a decade. We argue that this program provides protection for adult female wolverines through a combination of direct monetary value and indirect protection because of monitoring activities.

However the reported benefits of winterfeeding mule deer to increase survival and productivity in altered landscapes are mixed. Few studies have examined the long-term effects of winter-feeding on mule deer productivity. We studied the effects of a winter-feeding program conducted in a developed landscape in northern Utah, USA from 2001 to 2006 on the productivity, survival, and mortality of 92 adult female deer (does) that were captured and radiocollared on 4 feed and 4 nonfeed sites. We also evaluated the potential for feeding programs to impact winter-range habitat quality through increased browse utilization. Fawn production (P = 0.36), and survival (P = 0.12) did not differ for fed and nonfed does. Deer-vehicle collisions were the primary cause of mortality for radiocollared deer in both populations (P = 0.97). Utilization of desired browse species was higher on sites where deer were fed (P = 0.001), although deer numbers were similar at feed and nonfeed sites. When developing big game winter-feeding policies for developed landscapes, managers must consider the full range of long-term potential population and habitat impacts to include increased anthropogenic-related mortality and increased potential for habitat degradation prior to policy implementation. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/wsb.41","CE","CE_7799",212,0.325797606720992,0.273384128849335,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

7802,2011,"Reducing nontarget recaptures of an endangered predator using conditioned aversion and reward removal","Journal of Applied Ecology","1. Live-trapping is a fundamental tool in the study of wildlife species and populations. Capture of nontarget species is an inherent side-effect of trapping animals that is inefficient and potentially detrimental to individuals and populations. Reducing recapture of nontarget species will increase the efficiency of long-term studies and projects, and minimize unwanted impacts. 2. During the initial stages of a 3-year feral cat Felis catus control programme on San Clemente Island, California, USA, we experienced high recapture rates of nontarget endangered San Clemente Island foxes Urocyon littoralis clementae, impacting project efficiency and potentially foxes. 3. We investigated whether we could modify our baiting strategy to reduce fox recaptures using behavioural modification techniques, while simultaneously maintaining the ability to capture feral cats. We tested two strategies, aversive conditioning and reward removal, to reduce fox recapture rates. 4. Using lithium chloride (LC) as an aversive agent, we reduced fox recapture rates more than 10 times compared with rates using control bait. Using the reward removal technique, we reduced fox recapture rates almost 20 times compared with control baits. Neither behavioural modification technique deterred cats from entering traps, and our results suggest that by reducing fox recaptures, we improved our ability to capture cats. 5. Synthesis and applications. These novel baiting strategies have wide applicability in wildlife research and management. The efficiency of long-term monitoring or control programmes may be enhanced by discouraging recapture of 'trap happy' animals. Potential impacts to threatened species confined in traps could be minimized by reducing recaptures. Sampling of rare species in biodiversity studies could be improved by reducing recapture of competitively superior or numerically dominant species. © 2011 The Authors.

In most recovery efforts lethal and nonlethal influences of predators are not sufficiently understood to allow prediction of predation risk, despite its importance. We investigated whether landscape features could be used to model predation risk from coyotes (Canis latrans) and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) on the endangered black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes). We used location data of reintroduced ferrets from 3 sites in South Dakota to determine whether exposure to landscape features typically associated with predators affected survival of ferrets, and whether ferrets considered predation risk when choosing habitat near perches potentially used by owls or near linear features predicted to be used by coyotes. Exposure to areas near likely owl perches reduced ferret survival, but landscape features potentially associated with coyote movements had no appreciable effect on survival. Ferrets were located within 90 m of perches more than expected in 2 study sites that also had higher ferret mortality due to owl predation. Densities of potential coyote travel routes near ferret locations were no different than expected in all 3 sites. Repatriated ferrets might have selected resources based on factors other than predator avoidance. Considering an easily quantified landscape feature (i.e., owl perches) can enhance success of reintroduction efforts for ferrets. Nonetheless, development of predictive models of predation risk and management strategies to mitigate that risk is not necessarily straightforward for more generalist predators such as coyotes. © 2011 American Society of Mammalogists.","10.1644/10-MAMM-S-061.1","CE","CE_7805",241,0.23659816780337,-0.117219246315349,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Sixty adult bettongs were reintroduced from the island of Tasmania to two predator-free fenced reserves on mainland Australia. We examined baseline health parameters (body weight, haematology and biochemistry, parasites and infectious disease exposure) in a subset of 30 (13 male, 17 female) individuals at translocation and again at 12-24 months post-reintroduction. The mean body weight increased significantly post-reintroduction but there were no significant differences in body weight between the two reintroduction sites or between the sexes in response to reintroduction. Differences were evident in multiple haematological and biochemical variables post-reintroduction but there were few differences between the two reintroduced populations or between the sexes in response to reintroduction. Ectoparasite assemblages differed, with five of 13 species failing to persist, and an additional four species were identified post-reintroduction. None of the bettongs had detectable antibodies to the alphaherpesviruses Macropodid herpesvirus 1 and 2 post-reintroduction, including one individual that was seropositive at translocation. Similarly, the novel gammaherpesvirus potoroid herpesvirus 1 was not detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in any of the bettongs post-reintroduction, including one individual that was PCR-positive at translocation. None of the bettongs had detectable antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii either at translocation or post-reintroduction.

The role of livestock guarding dogs in predator control on Namibian farmlands","Oryx","The conflict between predators and livestock farmers is a threat to carnivore conservation. Livestock guarding dogs are promoted as a non-lethal, environmentally friendly method to mitigate this conflict. As part of a farmer-carnivore conflict mitigation programme, the Cheetah Conservation Fund breeds Anatolian shepherd (also known as Kangal) dogs to protect livestock from predators. During 2009-2010 we interviewed 53 commercial and 20 subsistence Namibian farmers that are using 83 such dogs. Fewer commercial and subsistence farmers reported livestock losses to predators during the most recent year of guarding-dog use compared to the year before dogs were introduced. All subsistence farmers, but not all commercial farmers, ceased killing predators during the most recent year of guarding-dog use. All farmers ceased killing cheetah Acinonyx jubatus and leopard Panthera pardus during this year, and one dog killed a single cheetah. Conversely, dogs and farmers killed more black-backed jackals Canis mesomelas between them in the survey year than the farmers reported killing in the year before acquiring dogs. Two of the dogs reportedly killed non-target carnivore species, and 15 killed prey species. Thus our results challenge the categorization of livestock guarding dogs as a non-lethal conflict mitigation method. We suggest that the conservation status and body size of wild carnivores relative to the size of the guarding dogs be considered before introducing dogs to protect livestock. Additionally, corrective training for dogs that chase or kill non-target species should be implemented, especially where farmers value these species or where non-target species are threatened.","10.1017/S0030605315000113","CE","CE_7810",251,0.203759093897239,-0.135525781953877,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
7811,2012,"The effect of protected areas on pathogen exposure in endangered African wild dog (<i>Lycaon pictus</i>) populations","Biological Conservation","Infectious diseases impact African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), but the nature and magnitude of this threat likely varies among populations according to different factors, such as the presence and prevalence of pathogens and land-use characteristics. We systematically evaluated these factors to assist development of locally appropriate strategies to mitigate disease risk. Wild dogs from 16 sites representing five unconnected populations were examined for rabies virus, canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and Babesia spp. exposure. Analyses revealed widespread exposure to viral pathogens, but Babesia was never detected. Exposure to CDV was associated with unprotected and protected-unfenced areas where wild dogs likely have a high probability of domestic dog contact and, in the case of protected-unfenced areas, likely reside amongst high wildlife densities. Our findings also suggest that domestic dog contact may increase rabies and coronavirus exposure risk. Therefore, domestic dogs may be a source of CDV, rabies and coronavirus, while wildlife may also play an important role in CDV transmission dynamics. Relatively high parvovirus seroprevalence across land-use types suggests that it might persist in the absence of spillover from domestic dogs. Should intervention be needed to control pathogens in wild dogs, efforts to prevent rabies and coronavirus exposure might be directed at reducing infection in the presumed domestic dog reservoir through vaccination. If prevention of CDV and parvovirus infections were deemed a management necessity, control of disease in domestic dogs may be insufficient to reduce transmission risks, and vaccination of wild dogs themselves may be the optimal strategy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2012.03.005","CE","CE_7811",255,0.212425351953476,-0.200316375416199,"300","negative","negative_300",0

Based on these results, we propose a potential dormouse management strategy that extends conventionally advocated coppice management for regions with well-developed forest edges by (i) postulating a blackberry-oriented landscape restoration approach and (ii) using clearing of mature trees as a tool to boost local dormouse populations in forest edges that have become unsuitable as dormouse habitat due to vegetational succession.","10.1007/s10344-014-0849-5","CE","CE_7815",164,0.255757359944556,0.374194526306933,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

7834,2013,"Effective control of non-native American mink by strategic trapping in a river catchment in mainland Britain","Journal of Wildlife Management","The introduction of American mink (Neovison vison; hereafter mink) into Europe has had severe impacts on many native wildlife species, including the water vole (Arvicola amphibius) in mainland Britain. Although trapping has been widely used to attempt to control mink, managers have little direct evidence of its effect on mink density or distribution, particularly where immigration of mink from nearby areas is inevitable. Such evidence is needed to justify the use of lethal methods in conservation policy. During 2006-2010 we removed mink from the River Monnow Catchment in western Britain, using track-recording rafts to monitor continuously for mink presence, guiding a strategic trapping effort. The area monitored and trapped was increased in stages, from a core sub-catchment with 109 km of water-course in 2006, to a 421-km2 catchment with 203 km of water-course in 2009. In each successive sub-catchment, mink detection and capture rates declined rapidly to near-zero levels after trapping began. Detections and captures showed seasonal peaks in every year corresponding to known dispersal periods, but also declined steadily from year to year, with increasing periods in which we did not detect mink. These results suggested that each sub-catchment was cleared of mink within a few months, with subsequent captures attributable to immigration. On average, we detected each mink 5.1 times before capture (daily probability of detection = 0.059 per mink and raft), and trapped them 3.4 days after deploying traps in response. On average, mink entering the area were likely to have been present for less than 13 days before capture. Water voles had been extinct in the Monnow Catchment since the 1980s. During 2006-2008 (starting 6 months after mink trapping commenced), we released 700 captive-bred water voles into the treatment area to re-establish a wild population. Persistence of this population through the 4 years of the project was considered indicative of effective mink control. This study demonstrates that, even in a mainland context, a systematic trapping strategy can have a substantial impact on the density and distribution of a damaging species, in this case allowing the restoration of a native prey species. © The Wildlife Society, 2013.","10.1002/jwmg.500","CE","CE_7834",343,0.178051213390119,-0.0405449021009311,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Public acceptance is higher than historically but there is a need to identify effective, acceptable techniques to facilitate coexistence. We present a case study of predation on livestock in Slovakia. Damage, mitigation measures and public opinion were assessed using compensation records, analysis of farm conditions, questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews, diet analysis and on-farm trials of livestock-guarding dogs. Economic damage was inconsequential on a national scale but high locally: c. 80% of reported losses occurred at 12% of sheep flocks. Grey wolves Canis lupus were held responsible for four to six times more damage than brown bears Ursus arctos, although livestock occurred in only 2 of 78 wolf faeces during spring-autumn, when sheep and cattle were most vulnerable. Losses to Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx were negligible. Compared to other sectors of society shepherds had the most negative attitudes, particularly towards wolves, despite compensation payments. Appropriate use of livestock-guarding dogs was associated with fewer losses: median loss at trial flocks with predation was 70% lower than at control flocks. We conclude that identifying vulnerable farms and targeting them for mitigation could reduce damage, although lack of motivation and awareness are obstacles. This study shows that damage levels need not be excessive despite high predator densities in human-dominated landscapes. Conflicts were unevenly distributed, with much of the variation explained by local conditions and husbandry practices, especially preventive measures.

To investigate the status of this cascade, in September of 2010 we repeated an earlier survey of aspen and measured browsing and heights of young aspen in 97 stands along four streams in the Lamar River catchment of the park's northern winter range. We found that browsing on the five tallest young aspen in each stand decreased from 100% of all measured leaders in 1998 to means of <25% in the uplands and <20% in riparian areas by 2010. Correspondingly, aspen recruitment (i.e., growth of seedlings/sprouts above the browse level of ungulates) increased as browsing decreased over time in these same stands. We repeated earlier inventories of cottonwoods and found that recruitment had also increased in recent years. We also synthesized studies on trophic cascades published during the first 15. years after wolf reintroduction. Synthesis results generally indicate that the reintroduction of wolves restored a trophic cascade with woody browse species growing taller and canopy cover increasing in some, but not all places. After wolf reintroduction, elk populations decreased, but both beaver (Caster canadensis) and bison (Bison bison) numbers increased, possibly due to the increase in available woody plants and herbaceous forage resulting from less competition with elk. Trophic cascades research during the first 15. years after wolf reintroduction indicated substantial initial effects on both plants and animals, but northern Yellowstone still appears to be in the early stages of ecosystem recovery. In ecosystems where wolves have been displaced or locally extirpated, their reintroduction may represent a particularly effective approach for passive restoration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2011.11.005","CE","CE_7836",291,0.180257957054803,0.131409544937557,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

There was a substantial decline in bait take by foxes in treatment areas from 2005 to 2013, and fox abundances were much lower in treatment than non-treatment areas throughout the experiment. Occupancy rates of all three native prey species increased in treatment areas relative to non-treatment areas, although the magnitude of the increase varied with species, treatment area, and time. Colonization and persistence rates were not always positive for all species and all treatment areas.

The value of captive breeding for recovery programs of endangered carnivorous mammals is often questioned because of low post-release survival reported for founder animals following translocation. Aims. The aim of the present study was to test the effect of rearing method on survival and body mass of captive-raised Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) following release on an offshore island. We also compared the post-release diet of these devils with the diet of wild devils on mainland Tasmania, where a similar array of diet items is available. Methods. Twenty-eight captive-raised devils were released onto the island; 19 had been raised in intensive captivemanagement facilities (IC) and nine in free-range (22 ha) enclosures (FRE). Survival and body-mass change were compared between IC and FRE for up to 440 days post-release. Devil diet was assessed via scat analysis. Key results. A high proportion (96%) of the founders survived 1 year post-release. Pre-release captive-rearing method had no effect. Released devils gained an average of 14% of their original body mass, irrespective of captive-rearing method. There was very little difference in the diet of captive-reared devils released onto Maria Island relative to wild mainland devils: Tasmanian pademelon, Thylogale billardierii, was the primary food item for both. Conclusions. The intensity of captive rearing did not affect the survival of devils released onto Maria Island. This suggests that even devils held in IC facilities retain the innate behaviour required to scavenge and hunt prey, and therefore maintain bodyweight post-release. The lack of any threatening processes on the island is also likely to have contributed to the high survival rate 2 years post-release. Implications. Our study provided preliminary evidence that the release of captive-raised Tasmanian devils onto off-shore islands is a viable conservation action. Captive-breeding programs and captive-raised founders can play a viable and valuable role in the conservation action plans for recovery programs of endangered carnivorous mammals.","10.1071/WR15221","CE","CE_7845",322,0.170063340113683,-0.0953599675774194,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1
7846,2011,"Effects of wildfires and post-fire forest treatments on rabbit abundance","European Journal of Wildlife Research","One of the main factors involved in the decline in the European wild rabbit in the Iberian Peninsula is the loss of suitable habitats caused by abandonment of agricultural and grazing activities. Nowadays, Mediterranean landscapes suffer from wildfires that affect extensive areas and produce considerable habitat changes. However, little is known about the influence of wildfires and post-fire treatments on rabbit abundance to address policies to recover their populations. To do so, we studied abundances of this species in four types of plots during three consecutive years after a wildfire in Catalonia (NE Spain): (A) unburnt forests, (B) burnt forests with removal of burnt trees but with branches left, (C) burnt forests with removal of burnt trees and branches, and (D) non-forested burnt plots. Rabbits progressively colonised burnt plots, where their abundance increased for at least 5 years after the fire, but decreased or even disappeared in unburnt ones, indicating that forest fires have a positive effect on rabbit populations. Although abundances did not differ between the three burnt plot types, plots with removal of burnt branches had the highest increase in abundance. In addition, soil covered by branches or by dense vegetation appeared negatively correlated with abundance, indicating that this could hinder rabbit movements, while some plant species could benefit rabbits by providing high quality food. Thus, post-fire treatments favourable to rabbit populations might therefore be a good way of increasing the conservation and economic value of areas affected by forest fires. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s10344-010-0412-y","CE","CE_7846",247,0.182165422834007,0.0065363498642317,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Treatment wolves (n = 10) visited shock zones less and spent less time at shock zones compared to control wolves (n = 4) during 40-day shock periods and 40-day post-shock periods. Treatment wolves remained away from shock zones for a greater number of days compared to control wolves. A smaller proportion of treatment pack members visited shock zones during shock and post-shock periods compared to control packs. Shock collars conditioned treatment wolves to avoid bait sites for >40 days and reduced visitation by other pack members. We also demonstrated the application of shock collars at the scale of livestock farms.

We used multiple regression analysis with theoretic information approach and multi-model inference to evaluate the effect of habitat variables and type of farming on hare abundance. Habitat structure (variety of crops) was the most important factor positively affecting hare abundance.

How animals are reintroduced into unfamiliar environments may have pronounced impacts on behavior, survival, and reproduction. We evaluated the influence of four release methods on survival rates of translocated swift foxes at Bad River Ranches (BRR) in western South Dakota: (1) hard-release, (2) short-soft-release, (3) long-soft-release, and (4) captive born. A total of 179 foxes captured in Wyoming during 2002-2007 and in Colorado during 2006-2007 were released into BRR and the surrounding area. In addition, 43 pups born to foxes in the long-soft-release category were also released. All release methods incorporated a 14- to 21-day quarantine period. Hard-release foxes were released directly from a transport kennel, whereas short-soft-release foxes were released from soft-release pens by opening the door and allowing the foxes to leave voluntarily. Long-soft-release foxes were held for more than 250 days on-site in soft-release pens through the winter and released in the following year in early summer. During 2002-2007, survival of reintroduced foxes differed significantly (p < 0.05) by age (adult vs. juvenile), release year, and release method. The short-soft-release method had the highest 60-day post-release survival probability compared with the other release methods. We did not detect any differences in mortality hazards between wild-born and short-soft-release foxes.

7863,2013,"Genetic diversity in a reintroduced swift fox population","Conservation Genetics","Swift fox (Vulpes velox) were historically distributed in southwestern South Dakota including the region surrounding Badlands National Park (BNP). The species declined during the mid-1800s, largely due to habitat loss and poisoning targeted at wolves (Canis lupus) and coyotes (Canis latrans). Only a small population of swift foxes near Ardmore, which is located in Fall River County, South Dakota, persisted. In 2003, a reintroduction program was initiated at BNP with swift foxes translocated from Colorado and Wyoming. Foxes released in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 were translocated from Colorado (BNP-Colorado) whereas in 2006, released foxes were translocated from Wyoming (BNP-Wyoming). Our objective was to evaluate genetic diversity and structure of the restored swift fox population in the area surrounding BNP compared to source fox populations in an area of Colorado and Wyoming, as well as the local swift fox population neighboring BNP near Ardmore in Fall River County, South Dakota. A total of 400 swift foxes (28 released in 2003, 28 released in 2004, 26 released in 2005, 26 released in 2006, 252 wild-born foxes, 40 individual foxes from the Ardmore area of South Dakota) was genotyped using twelve microsatellite loci. We report mean gene diversity values of 0. 778 (SD = 0. 156) for the BNP-Colorado population, 0. 753 (SD = 0. 165) for the BNP-Wyoming population, 0. 751 (SD = 0. 171) for the BNP population, and 0. 730 (SD = 0. 166) for the Fall River population. We also obtained Fst values ranging from 0. 014 to 0. 029 for pair-wise comparisons of fox populations (BNP, Fall River, BNP-Wyoming, BNP-Colorado). We conclude that the reintroduced fox population around BNP has high genetic diversity comparable to its source populations in Colorado and Wyoming.

7865,2013,"Demographic connectivity for ursid populations at wildlife crossing structures in Banff National Park","Conservation Biology","Wildlife crossing structures are one solution to mitigating the fragmentation of wildlife populations caused by roads, but their effectiveness in providing connectivity has only been superficially evaluated. Hundreds of grizzly (Ursus arctos) and black bear (Ursus americanus) passages through under and overpasses have been recorded in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. However, the ability of crossing structures to allow individual and population-level movements across road networks remains unknown. In April 2006, we initiated a 3-year investigation into whether crossing structures provide demographic connectivity for grizzly and black bears in Banff National Park. We collected hair with multiple noninvasive methods to obtain genetic samples from grizzly and black bears around the Bow Valley. Our objectives were to determine the number of male and female grizzly and black bears that use crossing structures; examine spatial and temporal patterns of crossings; and estimate the proportions of grizzly and black bear populations in the Bow Valley that use crossing structures. Fifteen grizzly (7 female, 8 male) and 17 black bears (8 female, 9 male) used wildlife crossing structures. The number of individuals detected at wildlife crossing structures was highly correlated with the number of passages in space and time. Grizzly bears used open crossing structures (e.g., overpasses) more often than constricted crossings (e.g., culverts). Peak use of crossing structures for both bear species occurred in July, when high rates of foraging activity coincide with mating season. We compared the number of bears that used crossings with estimates of population abundance from a related study and determined that substantial percentages of grizzly (15.0% in 2006, 19.8% in 2008) and black bear (17.6% in 2006, 11.0% in 2008) populations used crossing structures.

Additionally, roadways can impede movements and reduce habitat connectivity. For migratory ungulates, these problems can be exacerbated when roadways bisect migration routes, as is the case in Southwest Wyoming, USA, where a 21-km section of U.S. Highway 30 overlaps with a critical winter range and migration route used by thousands of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). In an effort to reduce deer-vehicle collisions (DVC) and maintain migratory connectivity, the Wyoming Department of Transportation installed 7 concrete box-culvert underpasses with continuous game-proof fencing between each crossing structure. To evaluate the effectiveness of this mitigation project, we used remote cameras to quantify the number of mule deer that used the underpasses, estimate passage rates through time, and compare rates of DVCs before and after underpass construction. Through 3 years of monitoring (which encompassed autumn migration [2008, 2009, and 2010], winter use, and spring migration [2009, 2010, and 2011] for 3 migration cycles), we documented 49,146 mule deer move through the underpasses. Passage rates of deer approaching underpasses steadily increased from 54% in Year 1 to 92% in Year 3. Peak movements during the autumn migration occurred in mid-December, while peak spring movements were in mid-March and early May. Underpass and fence installation effectively reduced DVCs by 81%. Had fence gates remained closed and cattle guards clear of snow, DVCs could be eliminated altogether. Our results suggest that underpasses, combined with game-proof fencing, can improve highway safety for motorists while providing safe and effective movement corridors for large populations of migratory mule deer. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/wsb.166","CE","CE_7866",263,0.228589571360264,0.0767768190193604,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

This study aimed at evaluating the method to cross-foster wolf pups from zoo-born to zoo-born litters. The following was assessed: female initial acceptance of foster pups, growth rate in relation to age difference between foster pups and pups in recipient litters and survival over the first 33 weeks. The study included four litters added by two foster pups in each. The age differences between the foster pups and the recipient litters were 2-8 days. After augmentation, all four females accepted the foster pups, demonstrated by her moving the entire litter to a new den site. Growth rate was dependent on the age difference of the pups in the foster litters, with a considerably slower growth rate in the 8 days younger pups. However, these pups later appeared to be at no disadvantage. Foster pups had a higher survival rate than females' pups, however, the causes of death were probably not kin or non-kin related.

Therefore, identifying the factors determining resource selection by the relocated animals is essential to improve the planning and the outcome of such programs. Using data collected in 2006-2009 in the framework of a restocking program, we studied the temporal variation of habitat selection in 14 translocated Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) during the year of their release and the following 3 years. We hypothesized a progressive adaptation of the translocated individuals, highlighted by a gradual decrease in the dissimilarities between translocated and resident individuals in ecological characteristics and social behavior. We tested the differences in habitat selection and home range size between the translocated and resident individuals and compared the spatial overlap between the groups. As expected, the dissimilarities decreased annually. The translocated and resident ibex almost immediately selected the same habitat resources, but the translocated individuals required 3 years to become fully socially assimilated. Our results indicated that habitat selection by gregarious species in a new environment is primarily driven by specific ecological requirements and that sociality plays a significant role. The translocated individuals tended to colonize areas already occupied by residents, either to fulfill social requirements and/or because the location of resident individuals may indicate high-quality habitat.

Our objective is to review the translocation program and provide recommendations for future efforts. There were no problems trapping, translocating, and maintaining foxes in captivity. We released 12 foxes onto NPR-1 in 1989 and 28 foxes in 1990. Of the 12 foxes released in 1989, 10 died within 1 year. Of 28 foxes released in 1990, 1 was still alive, 24 were dead, and the fate of 3 was undetermined when the study was terminated on 30 April 1992. Annual survivorship of translocated foxes was 0.03, which was less than survivorship of free-ranging foxes (0.35). Survivorship was not influenced by year of release, sex or age of translocated animals, or terrain in which foxes were released. Predation was the main cause of death. Six foxes survived through 1 breeding season, and 3 of these 6 foxes survived through 2 breeding seasons. Four of the 6 foxes bred with free-ranging foxes. Excluding 1 fox that moved 124 km before being killed by a vehicle, the distance between the release site and the location of death averaged 9.9 km (SE 1.9) for 11 foxes released in 1989 and 4.4 km (SE 1.1) for 24 adults released in 1990. The distance between the release site and the location of death was less for foxes released from pens in hilly terrain (3.1 km, SE 1.7) than for foxes released in level terrain (5.6 km, SE 1.5). Declining prey availability may have negatively influenced survivorship. Survivorship also may have been low because foxes were not familiar with their environment, including food and cover locations. Installing artificial dens or other forms of escape cover may improve survival of translocated foxes. If mortality factors can be mitigated, we believe the likelihood that foxes can be successfully translocated is good.

The experimental confirmation of agents of decline is a fundamental step in threatened species management, allowing for an efficient allocation of resources and effective species recovery. Aims Following unsuccessful attempts to increase the abundance of yellow-footed rock-wallaby populations through concerted goat control across the southern extent of their range, the primary aim of our study was to determine whether fox predation was limiting the recovery of wallaby populations. Methods Intensive fox-control programs (1080 baiting) were initiated around wallaby subpopulations in New South Wales and South Australia. Wallaby numbers were monitored for a three-year period before and after the initiation of fox control, and ANCOVA used to examine for differences between the subpopulation's rate of increase (r). Observational data were used to determine the demographic effects of fox predation on wallaby colonies in New South Wales. Key results Wallaby subpopulations that were treated with fox control increased significantly, while experimental control subpopulations remained at consistently low levels. Juvenile and subadult wallabies were apparent within the treated New South Wales subpopulation, but almost absent from the control subpopulation, suggesting that fox predation focussed primarily on these age classes. Conclusions Fox predation is a major limiting factor for southern wallaby populations and fox control should be the primary management action to achieve species recovery. Implications Although a significant limiting factor, the regulatory effect of fox predation was not assessed and, as such, it cannot be confirmed as being the causal factor responsible for the historic declines in wallaby abundance. The determination of whether fox predation acts in a limiting or regulatory fashion requires further experimentation, but its resolution will have significant implications for the strategic allocation of conservation resources.",NA,"CE","CE_7883",309,0.335214403519132,0.266565913769438,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

A well-developed understory in forestry plantations might serve as a surrogate habitat for native species and mitigate the negative effect of plantations on species richness. We experimentally tested this hypothesis by removing the understory in Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) plantations in central Chile and assessing changes in species richness and abundance of medium-sized mammals. Frequency of occurrence of mammals, including kodkods (Leopardus guigna), culpeo foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus), lesser grisons (Conepatus chinga), and Southern pudu deer (Pudu puda), was low in forest stands with little to no understory relative to stands with well-developed undergrowth vegetation. After removing the understory, their frequency of occurrence decreased significantly, whereas in control stands, where understory was not removed, their frequency did not change. This result strongly supports the idea that facilitating the development of undergrowth vegetation may turn forestry stands into secondary habitats as opposed to their containing no habitat for native mammals.

European otter (. Lutra lutra) predation on fish stocks of both economical and recreational value causes conflicts in many European countries. However, these stocking activities may also attract additional predators to a site. This case study aimed to investigate whether stocking of fish leads to higher otter densities in linear freshwater habitats in Central Europe. Otter faeces and data on fish stocks were collected in the province of Lower Austria along two salmonid streams, which differ considerably in fisheries management strategies. We used non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS) methods (genetic analysis of otter faeces) to ascertain otter individuals. Prey fish populations were assessed comparing length frequencies and fish biomass obtained from electrofishing series and data on stocking measures. Individual identification and socio-spatial organisation of resident otters revealed similar otter densities for both streams with 0.22 and 0.23 resident adult otters per stream kilometre. Length frequency distribution and biomass of fish indicated disappearance of stocked specimen at the time of electrofishing surveys and showed no significant difference of fish stocks between the streams. These results suggest that stocking activities may not affect the number of otter territories along the two streams studied, because availability of stocked fish is limited to angling season. We conclude that stocked streams may provide seasonally important food resources for otters, but raise the question whether stocked fish substantially contribute to the diet to raise carrying capacity for otters in linear freshwater habitats throughout a year. Furthermore we discuss the efficiency of stocking measures in streams where both self-sustaining fish populations and fish-eating predators occur.","10.1016/j.mambio.2015.01.004","CE","CE_7890",280,0.256365846525207,0.1671738577975,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Consequently, there is increasing interest in restoring beavers to locations where they historically occurred, particularly in the arid western United States. However, despite often intensive efforts to reintroduce beavers into areas where they were severely reduced in numbers or eliminated due to overharvesting in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, beavers remain sparse or missing from many stream reaches. Reasons for this failure have not been well studied. Our goal was to evaluate certain biotic factors that may limit the occurrence of dam-building beavers in northern New Mexico, including competitors and availability of summer and winter forage. We compared these factors at primary active dams and at control sites located in stream reaches that were physically suitable for dam-building beavers but where none occurred. Beaver dams mostly occurred at sites that were not grazed or where there was some alternative grazing management, but were mostly absent at sites within Forest Service cattle allotments. Results indicated that cattle grazing influenced the relation between vegetation variables and beaver presence. The availability of willows (Salix spp.) was the most important plant variable for the presence of beaver dams. We conclude that grazing by cattle as currently practiced on Forest Service allotments disrupts the beaver-willow mutualism, rendering stream reaches unsuitable for dam-building beavers. We recommend that beaver restoration will require changes to current livestock management practices.","10.1111/rec.12364","CE","CE_7893",251,0.164855898335155,0.12379521029554,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

We used an experimental translocation to elucidate the role of raccoon roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis) and inbreeding depression in the decline of the Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister), an endangered species. We translocated woodrats from genetically diverse populations in the core of the species range to 4 previously occupied sites (reintroductions) and 2 sites supporting genetically depauperate populations (reinforcements) in Indiana (U.S.A.). In 2 reintroduction sites and 1 reinforcement site, we distributed anthelmintic baits to passively deworm raccoons and reduce the risk of woodrat exposure to roundworms. The remaining sites served as controls. We used raccoon latrine surveys and fecal flotation to monitor temporal variability in roundworm prevalence and effect of treatment. We used live trapping and microsatellite genotyping to monitor the demographic and genetic response of translocated populations over the following 54 months. At the conclusion of the study, 4 of 6 translocations were successfully maintaining abundance through local recruitment. The distribution of anthelmintic baits reduced levels of roundworm contamination, but levels of contamination were also low in 2 of 3 control sites. Reintroductions failed at control sites, one of which was due to high roundworm exposure. The other failed control reintroduction was likely attributable to demographic stochasticity and limited reproductive potential following initial mortality within the first 4 months. In both control and treatment reinforcements, increases in both allelic richness and heterozygosity were accompanied by increases in abundance, which is suggestive of genetic rescue. Our results demonstrate that mitigation of roundworm exposure through the distribution of anthelmintic baits can facilitate woodrat recovery and that diversity within genetically depauperate populations can be restored through the introduction of a limited number of individuals. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/cobi.12064","CE","CE_7896",296,0.325222930204957,0.0339794828764357,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
7897,2014,"Allegheny woodrat (<i>Neotoma magister</i>) captive propagation to promote recovery of declining populations","Zoo Biology","The Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister) is endemic to the eastern United States with local distributions restricted to rocky habitats within deciduous forests. Over the last 40 years, woodrats have declined precipitously due to an array of human-mediated pressures. There is growing interest in the captive propagation of woodrats as a tool to promote in situ conservation, but their solitary social structure, territorial behavior, and low fecundity present challenges for the attainment of levels of ex situ reproduction sufficient to support reintroduction programs. In 2009 we established a captive breeding program with 12 wild-caught individuals (4.8) collected from Indiana and Pennsylvania. Restricting breeding to wild-caught individuals, over 26 months we produced 19 litters comprised of 43 pups (26.17), of which 40 (24.16) survived to weaning. In sum, wild-caught individuals readily habituated to the captive environment and the low fecundity of woodrats was offset by high survival rates for both adults and juveniles. Therefore, when managed appropriately, captive Allegheny woodrat populations should be capable of supporting the release of surplus individuals to augment in situ conservation measures.

For arboreal mammals, canopy bridges, glider poles and vegetated medians are used to provide safe passage across roads. However, the effectiveness of these measures is unknown. We investigate the effect of canopy bridges, glider poles and vegetated medians on squirrel glider movement across a freeway in south-east Australia. We monitored structures directly using motion-triggered cameras and passive integrated transponder (PIT) scanners. Further, post-mitigation radio-tracking was compared to a pre-mitigation study. Squirrel gliders used all structure types to cross the freeway, while the unmitigated freeway remained a barrier to movement. However, movement was not restored to the levels observed at non-freeway sites. Nevertheless, based on the number and frequency of individuals crossing, mitigation is likely to provide some level of functional connectivity. The rate of crossing increased over several years as animals habituated to the structure. We also found that crossing rate can be a misleading indicator of effectiveness if the number of individuals crossing is not identified. Therefore, studies should employ long-term monitoring and identify individuals crossing if inferences about population connectivity are to be made from movement data alone. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2012.10.016","CE","CE_7898",206,0.168155212056213,0.02839716073998,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Many studies have monitored the use of structures by wildlife, but studies that also incorporate individual identification methods can offer additional insights into their effectiveness. Aims We monitored the use of wildlife crossing structures by arboreal marsupials along the Hume Freeway in south-eastern Australia to (1) determine the species using these structures and their frequency of crossing, (2) determine the number and demographic characteristics of individuals crossing, and (3) use the rate of crossing by individuals to infer the types of movement that occurred. Methods We used motion-triggered cameras to monitor five canopy bridges and 15 glider pole arrays installed at 13 sites along the Hume Freeway. The five canopy bridges were also monitored with passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tag readers to identify the rate of use by individuals. Key results Five species of arboreal marsupial were detected using canopy bridges and glider poles at 11 sites. Our analysis suggested that increasing the number and the distance between poles in a glider pole array reduced the rate of use by squirrel gliders. The PIT tag and camera footage revealed that the structures were used by adult males, adult females and juveniles, suggesting that all demographic groups are capable of using canopy bridges and glider poles. At two canopy bridges, multiple squirrel gliders and common brushtail possums crossed more than once per night. Conclusions Given that previous studies have shown that the freeway is a barrier to movement, and that many of the species detected crossing are subject to road mortality, we conclude that canopy bridges and glider poles benefit arboreal marsupials by providing safe access to resources that would otherwise be inaccessible. Implications Although the factors influencing crossing rate require further study, our analysis suggests that glider pole arrays with fewer poles placed closer together are likely to be more successful for squirrel gliders. The individual identification methods applied here offer insights that are not possible from measuring the rate of use alone and should be adopted in future monitoring studies.","10.1071/WR14067","CE","CE_7899",352,0.144580350499335,0.0957202721221381,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Nevertheless, we still lack a detailed understanding on how different management practices influence individuals and populations. The overarching goal of our work was to investigate the demographic response of the hazel dormouse (. Muscardinus avellanarius) to forest management. We focused on a set of key individual (survival and litter size) and population (abundance of individuals) parameters to test whether forest management affects dormice and which habitat variables are responsible for such effects. We surveyed a dormice population for 3 years in a continuous forest in central Italy including sites subjected to different management regimes: 5 coppiced stands (2 recently coppiced and 3 old coppice stands), 2 abandoned stands with regrowing forest and 3 high forest stands. We found a strong effect of forest management on hazel dormice, acting mainly through the variation in food resources. Regrowing forests were the most suitable stands for dormice, whereas recent coppices were the most unsuitable, with an ephemeral presence of a few individuals. Old coppices and high forest stands were both able to sustain local populations but at lower densities and with a higher mortality and/or emigration of younger and/or weaker individuals than the regrowing forest. Through our detailed analyses we were able to uncover the demographic mechanism underlying the effects of forest management on hazel dormice populations; our findings strongly suggest that maintaining an heterogeneous successional composition may be the most effective strategy for the conservation of this species.","10.1016/j.mambio.2014.12.006","CE","CE_7901",246,0.247034715170985,0.147861857599388,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

In a free-access road, where forest has been cleared and fragmented by colonists, fewer species were found, together with wildlife density estimates that were almost 80% lower than on a control site without human disturbance. In contrast, on the road where access control has been enforced, habitat destruction has been minimal, but several wildlife species showed reductions in their populations, apparently related to changes in the subsistence practices of local Waorani hunters that settled along the road after its construction. In this area, economic subsidies and free transportation from the oil companies, access to the road, more efficient hunting technologies, and market incentives have increased the impacts of hunting by the Waorani, resulting in depletion of the local wildlife populations. Our research suggests that construction of roads in oil extraction areas must be avoided if at all possible.

Wildlife habitat, in particular, has been the focus of CWD investigations aimed at maintaining mammal species in managed forests. Piles and windrows of post-harvest woody debris could be designed to provide connectivity and habitat across clearcut openings for a wide array of mammalian species. Populations of microtines, such as the long-tailed vole (Microtus longicaudus), occur in early successional post-harvest habitats with vegetative and CWD cover, and may be potential pests feeding on newly planted trees. The role of CWD as habitat structures that attract voles and perhaps their predators may be part of a predator/prey pest-control scenario. Thus, we tested three hypotheses (H) that woody debris arranged in large piles and windrows, at a real-world scale, would increase (H1) the abundance, reproduction, and survival of long-tailed voles; (H2) the relative abundance of small weasels (Mustela spp.), and (H3) the incidence of feeding damage by voles to planted seedlings, compared with a dispersed (conventional) treatment on clearcut sites. Long-tailed voles were intensively live-trapped from 2007 to 2009 in replicated woody debris treatments of dispersed, piles, and windrows near Summerland in south-central British Columbia, Canada.Mean abundance of long-tailed voles was significantly higher (6.4-8.0 times) in treatment sites with piles and windrows than in the dispersed CWD treatment. Patterns in reproduction, recruitment, and survival generally followed those of abundance. There was a curvilinear regression relationship (r=0.72; P<0.01) between mean abundance of long-tailed voles and mean volume of CWD per ha across the dispersed, piles, and windrow treatments. A range of 400-600m3/ha of CWD in piles or windrows was required as habitat for viable populations of long-tailed voles on these clearcuts, at least during this 3-year period. Winter snow tracking data indicated that there was significantly more weasel activity in the treatment sites with piles than those with dispersed CWD, and similar activity in the dispersed and windrow sites. The predictions of H1 and H2 were supported. The incidence of feeding damage (<10%) by voles to planted seedlings was similar among treatment sites, and hence H3 was not supported. Based on the results of our 3-year study, woody debris structures do not appear to create conditions for buildup of Microtus populations to "" pest status"" such that newly planted trees are at risk from feeding damage. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.foreco.2011.09.001","CE","CE_7911",403,0.217343359700782,0.101781386105895,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) disappear from clearcuts within the first year or two after harvest, at least in studies in coniferous and mixed forests of western North America. Post-harvest woody debris arranged in large piles and windrows supports populations of M. gapperi on clearcuts and may extend their persistence there. Aims. To test the hypotheses (H) that for M. gapperi, (H1) population parameters of abundance, reproduction, and survival would be higher in windrow-forest than isolated windrow sites, and higher or similar to those in interior old forest sites; (H2) connectivity provided by windrow-forest structures will mitigate potential negative effects of clearcuts and abundance of M. gapperi will remain similar at the abrupt edge between forest and new clearcuts; and (H3) connectivity provided by windrow-forest structures will allow increased movements between both habitats. Methods. Study areas were located in three forest ecological zones in southern British Columbia, Canada. Populations of M. gapperi were sampled from 2010 to 2012 in three types of habitats on new clearcuts: isolated windrows of woody debris, windrows attached to uncut old forest, and in uncut old forest. Key results. Higher mean values of abundance and number of juvenile recruits of M. gapperi in the isolated windrow and windrow-forest sites than forest sites was contrary to our prediction for H1. In support of H2, we could not detect any differences in the mean number of captures among forest, edge and windrow sections of the windrow-forest sites, nor in the mean range length among the three habitat types. For H3, connectivity provided by windrow-forest structures may mitigate potential negative effects on abundance for M. gapperi at the abrupt edge between forest and new clearcuts. Conclusions and Implications. Voles did not commonly move between the forest and windrow habitats, but did move readily within forest and within windrows. Substantial movement by M. gapperi within windrows suggested that this microtine will move along windrows and potentially use these paths of connectivity to cross clearcuts. If the prey base is present, windrow connectivity may enhance these open areas for small mustelids and other carnivores and help maintain abundance and diversity of some forest mammals on clearcuts.","10.1071/WR14050","CE","CE_7912",363,0.119045336689451,0.0737499288998569,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Woody debris structures and conservation of forest mammals","Journal of Mammalogy","Coarse woody debris (CWD) from forest harvesting and salvage wood from wildfire and insect outbreaks provide habitat for an array of forest-floor small mammal species and some of their mammalian predators. Because forest clear-cutting reduces abundance of many mammal species, strategic management of postharvest debris could help maintain abundance and diversity of forest mammals on harvested sites. We tested hypotheses that abundance and species diversity of forest-floor small mammals would be lower on conventional clear-cuts than in uncut forest; abundance and species diversity of forest-floor small mammals and relative activity and species richness of winter mammals would be higher on clear-cut sites with woody debris arranged in large piles or windrows than a dispersed treatment of debris. Small mammals were intensively livetrapped, and winter mammals snow-tracked, from 2007 to 2009 in replicated (n = 3) woody debris treatments of dispersed, piles, windrows, and uncut mature forest at 3 study areas in south-central British Columbia, Canada. We captured all 9 species of forest-floor small mammals. Compared with uncut forest, clear-cutting had no effect on mean total abundance of the small-mammal community, and species richness and diversity were either similar or higher. With respect to habitat preference, generalist species increased while specialist species declined. Habitat structures of large piles and windrows of woody debris on clear-cuts dramatically ameliorated these responses. On the basis of track counts, relative activity and species richness of winter mammals were enhanced by these structures, but the response was species specific. This is the 1st investigation showing significant increases in abundance and species diversity of forest-floor small mammals associated with constructed piles and windrows of postharvest woody debris on clear-cuts.

Road removal is an increasingly common strategy for restoring habitat; however, little is known about responses of wildlife to road removal versus other methods of road closure. We assessed effects of different types of road closure (gated, barriered, and recontoured) on black bear (Ursus americanus) frequency and habitat on 18 open and closed road pairs in the western USA. Over 4. years, 44 bears were photographed during 3545 camera-trap days. Bear frequency was significantly higher (2.4 versus 0.6/100. days, respectively) and human frequency was significantly lower (2.4 versus 361.6/100. days, respectively) on closed than on open roads. Additionally, abundance of fall foods was higher (23.9% and 12.8%, respectively) and line-of-sight (a measure of habitat security) shorter (54.9 versus 69.4. m, respectively) on closed compared to open roads. Bears were detected on closed but not on open roads during daytime, suggesting avoidance of humans. Among-road-treatment differences included significantly higher frequency of bears on recontoured than on gated or barriered roads (4.6, 1.6, and 0.5/100. days, respectively), and significantly higher cover of fall bear foods on recontoured than on gated or barriered roads (39.3%, 12.1% and 16.4%, respectively). Frequency of bears was negatively correlated with frequency of humans and line-of-sight distance and positively correlated with abundance of fall foods and hiding cover.

This group of mammals has received scant attention worldwide despite major road projects potentially causing severe fragmentation to their habitat. Gliding mammals may be enabled to cross road gaps that exceed their gliding capability by the installation of tall wooden poles to act as ""stepping stones."" We investigated whether such glide poles installed across two land-bridges in eastern Australia could restore landscape connectivity for small gliding petaurid marsupials. Hair-traps revealed repeated use of all poles at both locations over periods of 1-3 years. Camera traps at one site suggest a crossing frequency on the poles by the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) of once every 3.8 nights. Radio-tracked animals did not glide directly over the road but instead used the poles to cross on the bridge. Hair-traps and camera traps installed within the middle of two reference land-bridges that lacked glide poles failed to detect crossings by gliding mammals despite their presence in adjacent forest. These observations suggest that glide poles can facilitate road crossing and thereby restore habitat connectivity for gliding mammals.

Trapping revealed that the northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus) and the long-nosed bandicoot (Perameles nasuta) were equally abundant prior to highway expansion.

Between 1986 and 2003 87 rhinoceroses from Chitwan were translocated into Bardia National Park and Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in the western terai region to establish founder populations and reduce the threat of local extinction from natural catastrophic events, disease and/or poaching. The founder populations increased in number through births but a rise in poaching during the period of civil strife in Nepal during 1996-2006 resulted in a dramatic decline in the populations, including in Chitwan. In 2001 the Terai Arc Landscape programme was initiated to connect 11 protected areas in Nepal and north-west India and facilitate dispersal of megafauna and manage them as metapopulations. Corridors that were restored under the programme and that connect Bardia and Suklaphanta with protected areas in India are now used by the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The successes and failures of the last 2 decades indicate that new paradigms for protecting rhinoceroses within and outside protected areas are needed, especially with reference to managing this species at a landscape scale. © 2013 Fauna & Flora International.","10.1017/S0030605311001670","CE","CE_7933",187,0.323349952247723,0.0776856516690675,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Monitoring reintroduced populations after release, in addition to understanding which factors affect translocations, is fundamental to understand the reintroduction process and to maximize the success of future interventions. By using boosted regression trees we evaluated the contribution of roe deer Capreolus capreolus reintroductions (1971-2008) to the current distribution of this species in Catalonia (Spain), and a partial least square regression approach was used to evaluate the influence of some variables as key for the roe deer reintroduction success. Our results show that roe deer currently occupies 85% of Catalonia territory, which represents an almost six-fold increase since the beginning of the 90s. Proximity to the nearest reintroduction nuclei was identified as one of the main drivers positively associated to the current distribution of roe deer in Catalonia, whereas the number of years after the first reintroductions and the number of animals released were important to the success of the reintroductions. We recommend the reintroduction of roe deer to release sites that contain large and suitable patches of habitat and that are sufficiently close to allow population continuity.","10.1016/j.mambio.2016.05.002","CE","CE_7942",193,0.277813434691965,0.36233764606761,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

However, the results of reintroductions have only recently been documented in the literature. Given the global decline of large carnivores, documenting the results of such attempts is crucial for future conservation management. Here we examined the reintroduction of brown bears into the Italian Alps. The majority of bears released (10 individuals) adapted well to the release area and this resulted in the increase of the brown bear population. At the end of 2012, the area with a stable presence of females was around 1250km2 (minimum density=3 bear/100km2). Between 2002 and 2012, 34 reproductive events occurred and a total of 74 cubs were born, thus reaching a minimum population size of 47 individuals. No less than 21 young males dispersed into adjacent Italian regions or into other countries, such as Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. However, despite a high mortality rate and at least two cases of illegal killing reported in the last 2 years (2013 and 2014), a remarkable population growth rate (current level of 15.6%) has been observed.The damages correlated with bear population size (F= 17.922, p<. 0.01) were primarily inflicted on beehives (39%) and livestock (26%), with an economic relevance of  41,374 per year for compensation and  23,527 per year for prevention. The only case of injury to humans ever since the beginning of the project was recorded in 2014, when a female defending her two cubs inflicted minor physical injuries to a man. And yet, public opinion changed radically, from a widespread acceptance of bears at the beginning of the project to an opposition to their presence, the increase of their population, and the new translocations aiming at replacing problem bears that had previously been removed. According to the present trend, the population may reach a range of 60-94 individuals in 2017. Therefore, a proper management of problem bears should be considered a key factor for the restoration and improvement of the social acceptance of this species.","10.1016/j.jnc.2015.03.007","CE","CE_7943",323,0.177727743699879,0.115848609657172,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
7945,2012,"The effects of restoring a conifer Plantation on an Ancient Woodland Site (PAWS) in the UK on the habitat and local population of the hazel dormouse (<i>Muscardinus avellanarius</i>)","European Journal of Wildlife Research","The common dormouse is a European protected species that is considered at risk during forest management operations in the UK. Historically, they were believed to exist principally in scrub and broadleaved woodlands, especially hazel coppice, but recent evidence has shown that they are present in some conifer sites at low density. Operations to restore conifer plantations on ancient woodland sites (PAWS) with native broadleaves may be especially hazardous to dormice populations, since dormouse densities are generally lower here so sudden perturbations may cause local extinction. Recent policy for restoring PAWS to broadleaved and the need to comply with European legislation has emphasised the need to devise appropriate but pragmatic forest management protocols involving the phased removal of conifers over time. Dormice were handled and individually marked on a single 12 ha conifer PAWS site from 2000 and a density index calculated from 2002 to 2007. In four adjacent study areas, a different form of PAWS restoration was carried out in 2003 to remove c. 33% of conifers. The effects on dormouse numbers, damage to artificial hibernation nests, and regeneration of suitable habitat were recorded. Monitoring indicated that dormouse populations were sustained in each study area after management, suggesting that at this site, conifer removal operations did not have a significant detrimental effect on the dormouse population. Damage to artificial hibernation nests was significantly different between the four study areas. The least damage occurred in the study area containing large group fells due to potential refuge areas, and worst in the traditional standard overall thinning. Measured differences in shrub vegetation throughout each study area showed that numerous small group fells or a few larger group fells subsequently regenerated to form a better vegetation structure for dormice than the traditional standard overall thinning.

7947,2013,"Livestock depredation and mitigation methods practised by resident and nomadic pastoralists around Waza National Park, Cameroon","Oryx","Conflict between humans and lions Panthera leo is a key factor driving population declines of lions in Africa, especially in communal lands and on the edges of small protected areas. We assessed this conflict in Waza National Park, Cameroon, in 2008 through an interview survey. A total of 207 resident and 174 nomadic pastoralists were interviewed. Results indicated high levels of livestock depredation around the Park, with attacks occurring most often at night. Lions were economically a substantial threat accounting for total losses of EUR 100,000 per annum. Per household, resident pastoralists lost one cow and nomadic pastoralists two cows per annum, equating to c. EUR 260 and 520, respectively. To mitigate these losses resident pastoralists used enclosures for nocturnal protection of their livestock more than nomadic pastoralists, who tended to herd livestock more during pasture. Improved mitigation methods pertaining to herding practice, the use of enclosures and the presence of dogs resulted in a reduction of 25% livestock depredation and 50% cattle depredation. These methods could be further improved, however, education and awareness about the ranging behaviour of lions during different seasons and periods of the day is important for all pastoralists. Additionally, park management needs to be improved through effective law enforcement.

7952,2012,"Good dog! Using livestock guardian dogs to protect livestock from predators in Australiaâs extensive grazing systems","Wildlife Research","Context Wild predators are a serious threat to livestock in Australia. Livestock guardian dogs (LGDs) may be able to reduce or eliminate predation, but their effectiveness in Australian grazing systems has not been systematically evaluated. In particular, little is known about the effectiveness of LGDs in situations where they range freely over large areas in company with large numbers of livestock. Aims We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of LGDs as currently used in Australia and determine the factors influencing effectiveness, in particular in relation to scale of management. We also documented how LGDs are managed in Australia, evaluated their cost effectiveness, and identified factors that influence the number of dogs required in different property situations. Methods We conducted a telephone survey of 150 livestock producers with LGDs in Australia, including all livestock types and property situations, in all States. Ten producers were visited, of which one is detailed as a case study. Key results Effectiveness was apparently high: 65.7% of respondents reported that predation ceased after obtaining LGDs, and a further 30.2% reported a decrease of predation. When the number of stock per dog exceeds 100, LGDs might not be able to eliminate all predation. Dogs are often kept free-ranging on large properties where wild dogs are the main predator, but are usually restricted in their movements on smaller properties or with smaller predators. The cost of obtaining a LGD is returned within 13 years after the dog starts working. The number of dogs required for a property mainly depends on the number of livestock needing protection, and the main type of predator in the area. Conclusions Provided a sufficient number of LGDs are used, they can be as effective in protecting livestock from predators in Australia when ranging freely on large properties with large numbers of livestock as they are in small-scale farming systems. Implications LGDs can provide a cost-effective alternative to conventional predator control methods in Australia's extensive grazing enterprises, potentially reducing or eliminating the need for other forms of control. LGDs could play a major role in securing the viability of livestock businesses and reconciling peoplepredator conflict in Australia. © 2012 CSIRO.","10.1071/WR11135","CE","CE_7952",352,0.260215158865078,0.151126828314471,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
7955,2016,"Effects of grazing management on biodiversity across trophic levels â the importance of livestock species and stocking density in salt marshes","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","European coastal salt marshes are important for the conservation of numerous species of specialist plants, invertebrates, breeding and migratory birds. When these marshes are managed for nature conservation purposes, livestock grazing is often used to counter the dominance of the tall grass Elytrigia atherica, and the subsequent decline in plant species richness. However, it remains unclear what is the optimal choice of livestock species and stocking density to benefit biodiversity of various trophic levels. To fill this knowledge gap, we set up a triplicate, full factorial grazing experiment with cattle and horse grazing at low and high stocking densities (0.5 or 1 animal ha-1) at the mainland coast of the Dutch Wadden Sea. Here, we present the results after 4 years and integrate these with previously published results from the same experiment to assess effects of livestock grazing on various trophic groups. Stocking density affected almost all measured variables: high stocking densities favoured plant species richness and suppression of E. atherica, whereas low stocking densities favoured abundances of voles, pollinators and flowers. Densities of different functional groups of birds showed no significant response to the regimes, but tended to be somewhat higher under 0.5 horse and 1 cattle ha-1. Choice of livestock species had fewer and smaller effects than stocking density. Horse grazing was detrimental to vole density, and showed an interactive effect with stocking density for Asteraceae flower abundance. Multidiversity, a synthetic whole-ecosystem biodiversity measure, did not differ among regimes. These results are discussed in the light of other results from the same experiment. Because of these contrasting effects on different trophic groups, we advise concurrent application of different grazing regimes within a spatial mosaic, with the inclusion of long-term abandonment. High density horse grazing, however, is detrimental to biodiversity.","10.1016/j.agee.2016.11.001","CE","CE_7955",288,0.131760005799564,0.0973554485726714,"300","neutral","neutral_300",1

Two common forms of such governance are protected areas, and community lands open to limited resource extraction. We studied wildlife occurrences in the north-east Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, where the Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary (EWS) is situated adjacent to community lands governed by the Bugun and Sherdukpen tribes. We conducted transect-based mammal sign surveys and camera trapping for mammals (>0.5kg), and interviewed members of the resident tribes to understand their hunting practices and causes of wildlife declines. Interviews indicated hunting-mediated declines in the abundances of mammals such as the tiger Panthera tigris, gaur Bos gaurus and river otters Lutrogale and Aonyx species. Larger species such as B.gaurus were much more abundant within EWS than outside of it. Community-managed lands harbored smaller bodied species, including some of conservation importance such as the red panda Ailurus fulgens, clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa and golden cat Pardofelis temminckii.

However, the presence of water inside culverts can seriously limit their effectiveness. The implementation of dry ledges can be a good measure to allow crossing when flooded. So far, there is a lack of knowledge on the effectiveness of dry ledges combined with fencing for a wide diversity of vertebrates. The main goal of this study is to evaluate how the presence of dry ledge affect culvert use for Mediterranean mesocarnivores (red fox Vulpes vulpes, stone marten Martes foina, European badger Meles meles, European otter Lutra lutra and common genet Genetta genetta). Between January and March 2008, wooden dry ledges were placed in 15 of 32 surveyed culverts. Additionally 100. meters of small mesh size and buried fences were installed along each side of all culverts. During one year we used video surveillance and track-plates to detect crossing events over seven consecutive nights per season in each monitored culvert. We evaluate the relative importance of dry ledges on culvert use and compare the number of road-kills within a 100. m buffer radius around the culverts before and after fence installation and culverts that were never fenced (control culverts). Although different species responded to culvert features differently, the presence of dry ledges was the most relevant feature explaining crossing events, in particular, for stone martens and genets. The fencing used did not reduce mammals road-kill prevalence. Our results imply that in order to improve culvert use, road managers should take into account the placement of ledges on culverts that remain flooded most of the year (more than 3. cm of water-depth). We also suggest exploring the role of ledge size and construction materials to increase the likelihood of being used by foxes and badgers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.04.005","CE","CE_7964",304,0.16062272945627,0.0825036105721837,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
7965,2013,"There is no place like home: high homing rate and increased mortality after translocation of a small mammal","European Journal of Wildlife Research","Animal translocation is a popular tool in wildlife management. It is frequently used to solve human-animal conflicts and recently has been applied as a mitigation tool when animals inhabit land desired for development. However, its success is uncertain and involves risks. In order to provide useful information to wildlife managers about the effect of translocation distance on animal movement behavior and survival, we translocated 40 Long-haired field mice (Abrothrix longipilis) at different distances from their territories (0-1,300 m) in central Chile and recorded the location and survival of each mouse over 3 days. Translocated animals showed low release site fidelity and traveled two- to four-fold longer distances than the nontranslocated group. Only mice translocated at shorter distances (100 m) oriented their movement toward their origin site and had a high probability of homing (80 %). There were threshold distances from after which homing and traveling strongly decreased. All individuals released close to their capture site (=100 m) remained alive, while mortality reached 22 % at longer translocation distances, principally as a result of fighting between rodents. Therefore, long translocation distances prevented short-term homing and decreased traveled distances (a desirable outcome), but risks associated with conspecific encounters need to be avoided. Because mice showed a high motivation to explore surroundings, it is advisable to release animals in sites with alternative places to colonize. Our results emphasize the need for a strong justification in wildlife translocation projects and the development of alternative techniques to improve animal welfare and conservation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","10.1007/s10344-013-0730-y","CE","CE_7965",246,0.262612888903424,0.153672256576548,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

However, success of such operations is often low due to poor short-term survival and experimental evidence is required to improve restocking results. We tested the impact of different release conditions on survival and reproduction of captive bred common hamsters (Cricetus cricetus L. 1758), a highly endangered species in Western Europe. As predation plays a determinant role for released hamsters, especially during the first days after restocking, we performed two release experiments intending to reduce mortality: we tested (1) the efficiency of terrestrial predator proof electric fences and (2) the impact of improved shelter availability. We assessed both survival rate and reproductive success by radiotracking 70. hamsters between release date and the end of their aboveground active period. Reducing contact between released animals and predators thanks to electric fences had a strong positive impact on hamsters' survival and allowed them to have enough time to reproduce. It also appeared that release of hamsters was more efficient in wheat crop than in alfalfa. As expected, wheat harvest, inducing a sudden lack of shelter, negatively impacted restocking success. Finally, lifetime after release affected the number of litters per female and varied with individual characteristics: it decreased with burrow change frequency and was slightly lower for males. We conclude that electric fences associated with permanent well-developed vegetative cover like unharvested wheat seem to be suitable for releasing hamsters. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2012.08.007","CE","CE_7966",239,0.247180064562135,0.217456063129395,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

7979,2011,"Can supplemental food increase winter survival of a threatened cottontail rabbit?","Biological Conservation","Populations of New England cottontails (Sylvilagus transitionalis) have declined substantially in recent decades in response to habitat loss and fragmentation. Among some remnant populations, cottontails occupy small patches of thicket habitat where they experience high mortality rates as a consequence of limited food during winter. This limitation causes rabbits to forage away from cover where they are exposed to predators. Although conservation efforts are emerging to reverse the decline of New England cottontails, most are directed toward improving long-term viability by increasing the abundance of suitable habitats. Such efforts do little to improve the short-term survival of remaining cottontails. To address this immediate need, we evaluated the use of supplemental food as an approach to improve overwinter survival rates. We speculated that by positioning feeders in close proximity to escape cover, rabbits would be less vulnerable to predators. We evaluated this approach using eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus) as a research surrogate because this species is readily available and has similar habitat requirements to New England cottontails. Transmitter-equipped eastern cottontails were randomly assigned to either a fed or unfed group. Remotely-triggered cameras were also used to gauge use of feeders by cottontails and visits by other species. Winter survival rates were substantially greater for fed rabbits (70%) than for unfed rabbits (32%). Cameras revealed that rabbits were the most frequent consumer and that there was only limited carnivore activity near feeders. We conclude that supplemental feeding may improve survival of remaining New England cottontails as efforts to increase habitat availability continue to develop. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2011.04.027","CE","CE_7979",256,0.408809768266372,0.190212613881987,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Large carnivore translocation is one such strategy but it has shown limited success. Many reported examples used methods that likely contributed to their failure. We conducted six leopard (Panthera pardus) translocations (three males, three females) within Namibia to test specific criteria for improved protocols. We moved leopards 402.7 km (SD = 279.6 km, range 47754 km). Overall translocation success, using strict criteria, was 67 % and increased to 83 % when post-release conflict was not considered in this assessment. Four individuals successfully established new territories after exploratory periods of <2 months. One female died in a road accident shortly after release and a male resumed killing livestock that were illegally herded within a protected area. Both surviving females produced cubsthe ultimate sign of success. When compared with resident leopards (six males, six females), translocated individuals showed no significant difference in range behaviour, survivorship or likelihood of conflict. At their capture sites, livestock depredation ceased for a minimum of 16 months, thus at least temporarily alleviating conflict. We used our successful protocol to develop a translocation suitability model for determining appropriate release sites. For Namibia, this model predicts potential recipient habitat of 117,613 km2, an area sufficient to support up to 87 leopard translocations. Where alternative conservation strategies have failed and managers decide to proceed with translocations, we recommend the application of our conservative protocol to identify the most suitable recipient locations. Our study demonstrates the potential value of translocation under specific circumstances and as part of a larger conflict management repertoire.

To enhance the available knowledge on the reintroduction biology of the warru, or black-footed rock-wallaby Petrogale lateralis MacDonnell Ranges race, we conducted a trial reintroduction of 16 captive individuals into a fenced predator and competitor exclosure on the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia. We conducted seven trapping sessions and used radio-tracking and camera traps to monitor survival, reproduction and recruitment to the population over 36 months. Blood samples were collected pre-release and during two trapping sessions post-release to assess nutritional health. The survival rate of founders was 63%, with all losses occurring within 10 weeks of release. Post-release blood biochemistry indicated that surviving warru adapted to their new environment and food sources. Female warru conceived within 6 months of release; 28 births were recorded during the study period and 52% of births successfully recruited to the population. Our results suggest that captive-bred warru are capable of establishing and persisting in the absence of introduced predators. However, the high mortality rate immediately post-release, with only a modest recruitment rate, suggests that future releases into areas where predators and competitors are present should use a trial approach to determine the viability of reintroduction. We recommend that future releases of warru into unfenced areas include an intensive monitoring period in the first 3 months post-release followed by a comprehensive long-term monitoring schedule to facilitate effective adaptive management.","10.1017/S0030605315001490","CE","CE_7984",250,0.268043666909182,0.192624992989134,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Culls differentially affected breeding herds and altered gender structure, created reduced female cohorts, and dampened productivity. The ecological future of plains bison could be significantly enhanced by resolving issues of disease and social tolerance for Yellowstone bison so that their unique wild state and adaptive capabilities can be used to synergize the restoration of the species.

The North Dakota Game and Fish Department subsequently introduced California bighorn sheep (formerly O. c. californiana) that were indigenous to the Williams Lake region of British Columbia, Canada, and Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (O. c. canadensis) that were indigenous to the Sun River region of Montana. Although California bighorn sheep are no longer recognized as a distinct subspecies, they are smaller and adapted to a milder climate than either the native bighorn sheep of North Dakota or introduced bighorn sheep from Montana. Because reintroductions still play a key role in the management of bighorn sheep and because local adaptation may have substantial demographic consequences, we evaluated causes of variation in recruitment of bighorn sheep reintroduced in North Dakota. During 2006-2011, Montana stock recruited 0.54 juveniles/adult female (n=113), whereas British Columbia stock recruited 0.24 juveniles/adult female (n=562). Our most plausible mixed-effects logistic regression model (53% of model weight) attributed variation in recruitment to differences between source populations (odds ratio=4.5; 90% CI=1.5, 15.3). Greater recruitment of Montana stock (fitted mean=0.56 juveniles/adult female; 90% CI=0.41, 0.70) contributed to a net gain in abundance (r=0.15), whereas abundance of British Columbia stock declined (fitted mean=0.24 juveniles/adult female; 90% CI=0.09, 0.41; r=-0.04).

Inter-calf interval corresponds with findings from reintroductions in Oman and elsewhere in Saudi Arabia but increased with progressing age. Calving occurred throughout the year with no distinct seasonality. Fecundity was higher in experienced founder females, albeit not significantly. Overall fecundity was highest in young females, decreased in middle aged animals, and remained stable throughout the rest of their life span. Our findings may have an influence on future reintroductions of Arabian oryx and confirm theories in behavioural ecology of ungulates. © 2011 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.","10.1016/j.mambio.2011.01.004","CE","CE_8001",186,0.16782859506703,0.223406535117261,"200","neutral","neutral_200",1

Here, we present the first data on population development and current problems of the Przewalski's horse in both captive and released populations in Xinjiang. From 1985 to 2005, a total of 24 captive Przewalski's horses (14 males and 10 females) were brought from western zoos to the Jimsar Wild Horse Breeding Center (WHBC) in Xinjiang. In 1988, the first foal was born. Since then, a total of 285 foals have been born and the number of animals in the captive population continues to increase. In August 2001, the first group of horses was released into semi-wild conditions in the Kalamaili Nature Reserve (KNR). Released horses were allowed to range freely from spring to fall, but were driven into a winter coral to allow for supplemental feeding and to increase winter survival, and to reduce competition with domestic horses from local herdsmen who use the KNR as winter pasture. By December 2013, a total of 89 horses (32 males and 57 females) in 14 groups had been transferred to semi-release; and within two years after the first release, the first foal was successfully born in the wild. By 2013, the reintroduced animals had formed into 16 groups (127 individuals, 13 breeding and 3 bachelor group) in 5 sites.

8003,2016,"Logging residues conserve small mammalian diversity in a Malaysian production forest","Biological Conservation","The extraction of large trees by selective logging in tropical production forests often results in a reduction of natural fallen trees for a long period after logging has been completed. This causes a population decrease for various small mammals that exploit fallen trees to live. We expect that logging residues, which are unmerchantable upper parts of logged trees, will alleviate the negative effects of the reduced volume of naturally fallen trees immediately after logging. To examine this issue, we compared the activity of small mammals in forest floor habitats with and without logging residues in a Malaysian production forest using a camera trapping technique. We tested the hypothesis that the activity of small mammals would be higher on forest floors with logging residues when compared with those without them; our study affirmatively supported this hypothesis. Therefore, logging residues are expected to have positive roles in maintaining small mammal diversity at the ground level in production forests. Recently commercial use of logging residues has been promoted; however, removing all logging residues from a production forest would severely and negatively affect the diversity of ground-dwelling small mammals. In addition, for small mammals which essentially require fallen trees to survive, populations will shrink or in a worst case scenario, they would become extirpated from production forests if all logging debris is removed.","10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.004","CE","CE_8003",220,0.227971840590658,0.0369752086091957,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Black bear (Ursus americanus) predation was the primary calf mortality factor. From 2006 to 2008, we trapped and relocated 49 bears (30 of which were radiocollared) from the primary calving areas in the Park and radiomonitored 67 (28 M:39 F) adult elk and 42 calves to compare vital rates and population growth with the earlier study. A model with annual calf recruitment rate correlating with the number of bears relocated each year was supported (dAICc=0.000; ß=0.070, 95% CI=0.028-0.112) and a model with annual calf recruitment differing from before to during bear relocation revealed an increase to 0.544 (total SE=0.098; ß=-1.092, 95% CI=-1.180 to -0.375). Using vital rates and estimates of process standard errors observed during our study, 25-yr simulations maintained a mean positive growth rate in 100% of the stochastic trials with averaging 1.118 (95% CI=1.096-1.140), an increase compared with rates before bear relocation. A life table response experiment revealed that increases in population growth were mostly (67.1%) due to changes in calf recruitment. We speculate that behavioral adaptation of the elk since release also contributed to the observed increases in recruitment and population growth. Our results suggest that managers interested in elk reintroduction within bear range should consider bear relocation as a temporary means of increasing calf recruitment. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.149","CE","CE_8004",245,0.117147870216332,0.150928684561201,"250","neutral","neutral_250",1

We aimed to investigate the seasonal home-range size and habitat use of woylies to update current knowledge of the species in the context of a substantial decline. Specifically, we examined the home range and habitat use of woylies reintroduced into a sanctuary free from invasive predators and compared these data to those from an external reference site. Eight woylies inside the sanctuary and seven outside were radio-tracked in autumn 2011. The average home-range size was 65.4 (±8.2, s.e.) ha. There was little evidence to suggest any difference in home-range size between woylies inside and outside the sanctuary. Woylies were more likely to be found in the slope and low-lying valley habitats, which have greater water-holding capacity and sandier soils. These relatively large seasonal home ranges, compared with previously published estimates for the species, may be accounted for by low population density, lower seasonal food availability and clustered food distribution. Monitoring the home-range size of woylies within the sanctuary may assist in identifying the carrying capacity of the sanctuary, which has implications for how this population is managed.","10.1071/AM14022","CE","CE_8006",222,0.14939176346627,0.276779359407122,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

It is therefore important to evaluate in the field the effectiveness of nonlethal control techniques that should be economically feasible and socially acceptable. Until now, the effect of deterrents on felids has not been assessed systematically. We hypothesized that the occurrence of alien objects or sounds would scare the felids away, at least temporally. In this study, we applied visual and auditory deterrents in paddocks in a natural reserve of Central Mexico. We performed field tests in six ranches with predation problems: four as treatment plots and two as controls. To test the effectiveness of deterrents, the numbers of tracks and photos of felids, and the number of attacks to livestock that occurred during the test period were compared between the treatment and the control ranches. We also performed a cost-benefit analysis to assess the feasibility of the application of deterrents. Deterrents were effective in reducing predation during the 2-month test. The benefit of their application was 11 times higher than the annual cost of handling of predation for cattle owners and 3 times for owners of goats. Deterrents appear a useful tool that could assist ranchers in livestock protection, indirectly contributing to the conservation of wild felids and promoting their coexistence with rural communities. © 2014 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/acv.12104","CE","CE_8009",236,0.298197837563612,0.0999011726887789,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8010,2011,"Population trends of brown hares in Switzerland: the role of land-use and ecological compensation areas","Biological Conservation","Over the last decades, agricultural land-use practices have been intensified throughout Europe. As a consequence of the resulting loss of habitat heterogeneity, numerous species associated with traditional farmland have undergone severe population declines. To mitigate the negative effects of intensive agriculture on farmland biodiversity, agri-environment schemes (AES) have been adopted in various European countries since the early 1990s. The effects of AES have been evaluated for different taxa, but rarely for larger mammals like the brown hare (Lepus europaeus), a characteristic species of traditional open farmland.Using spotlight counts from 58 brown hare monitoring study sites over 17. years, we analysed the effects of land-use and several agri-environment scheme options on brown hare density in the Swiss lowland. We used open-population binomial mixture models to jointly model abundance and detection probability, thereby accounting for imperfect detection of hares. Mean observed counts of brown hares in Switzerland from 1992 to 2008 suggested a slight decline followed by a recovery in arable study sites, whereas a sustained decline was apparent in grassland sites. Mean detection probability ranged widely from year to year (arable: 0.33-0.70; grassland: 0.21-0.80). When accounting for imperfect detection, a population recovery was apparent in both land-use types, although hare densities remained at low levels compared to other European countries.The amount of extensively managed hay meadows seemed to have a positive effect on brown hare abundance both in arable and grassland sites. Hedgerows were also positively related to hare density, although only in arable study sites. The amount of set-asides/wildflower strips and brown hare density were related neither in arable nor in grassland sites. This result was probably caused by the fairly low percentages of this AES option in our study sites.Habitat improvements by means of AES indicate some positive effects on brown hare populations in Switzerland, but the quantity and quality of AES must still be increased. Combined with a binomial mixture model correcting for imperfect detection, spotlight counts are an effective tool for estimating population trends, especially for large-scale and long-term surveys like the Swiss brown hare monitoring. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2010.11.021","CE","CE_8010",348,0.303323466417758,0.154157951460072,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
8011,2016,"Understanding unexpected reintroduction outcomes: Why aren't European bison colonizing suitable habitat in the Carpathians?","Biological Conservation","Reintroductions are an important tool for re-establishing or reinforcing populations of threatened species, and thus to restore ecosystems. However, predicting how reintroduced populations will spread is difficult, and past reintroductions often lacked a thorough assessment of habitat availability and connectivity. Using the case of reintroduced European bison (Bison bonasus L.) in the northern Carpathians, we show how habitat suitability models in combination with connectivity assessments based on circuit theory can remedy such shortcomings, and identify potential habitat patches and corridors between these. European bison were reintroduced in our study area in the 1960s, and against prior expectation, have not spread along the Carpathian ridge, but instead expanded their range towards human settlements. Our analyses provide an explanation for this pattern. Although we identified a network of suitable habitat patches along the Carpathian ridge, the functional connections between them were limited due to a number of major barriers to movement. To avoid future conflicts between European bison and people, and to achieve the long-term goal of a viable bison metapopulation in this region, conservation action should focus on establishing connectivity between habitat patches through the creation and legal protection of corridors and wildlife passages, which would benefit Carpathian wildlife in general. Our study emphasizes the importance of landscape-scale connectivity analyses to guide restoration efforts, and of adaptive management to ensure the success of reintroduction projects.","10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.032","CE","CE_8011",227,0.257953890090021,0.302419703358806,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8017,2017,"Investigating the potential impact of trophy hunting of wild ungulates on snow leopard <i>Panthera uncia</i> conservation in Tajikistan","Oryx","Declining availability of prey is potentially a major factor limiting snow leopard Panthera uncia populations in Tajikistan and neighbouring states. Conservation initiatives to develop community-based trophy hunting programmes for ibex Capra sibirica and argali Ovis ammon polii aim to provide financial incentives for communities to limit poaching of wild ungulates. Such programmes could help to reverse local declines in ibex and argali populations, and consequently snow leopard populations, while simultaneously improving the economic status of local people. However, in practice the desired effect may not materialize. To investigate the premise, we estimated the population density of the snow leopard, using a spatial capture-recapture model based on camera trapping in two study areas (each c. 1,000 km2) in the Tajik Pamirs: A well-managed trophy hunting concession and an otherwise similar area where grazing and poaching are unmanaged. We used distance-Truncated counts to assess relative densities of wild and domestic ungulates between sites, and faecal analyses to compare the dietary habits of snow leopards. Our data were limited in scope but suggested that the density of snow leopards and the relative density of wild and domestic ungulates may have been greater in the hunting concession, where wild ungulates accounted for a greater proportion of prey items. Our results provide preliminary evidence that trophy hunting of ungulates may be a viable tool for achieving snow leopard conservation goals; however, we conclude that further investigation is necessary to adequately address the question.","10.1017/S0030605316000193","CE","CE_8017",241,0.214409230434878,0.0670265745893552,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Supplemental feeding of wildlife has high potential for influencing the behaviour and diet of opportunistic omnivores, such as bears. Supplemental feeding of brown bears Ursus arctos is a common practice in several European countries, but the effects of this controversial and expensive management measure on bear diet and behaviour are poorly understood. We analysed 714 brown bear scats collected throughout the year in three regions of Slovenia with different densities of supplemental feeding sites. Supplemental food was the most important food category in the bear diet and represented 34% of the annual estimated dietary energy content (maize: 22%, livestock carrion: 12%). The proportion of supplemental food in the diet varied with season and region, being highest in spring and in the region with the highest density of feeding sites. However, considerable seasonal changes in bear diet, despite year-round access to supplemental food, suggest that bears prefer high-energy natural food sources, particularly insects, fruits, and hard mast, when available. Despite high availability and use of supplemental food, human-bear conflicts are frequent in Slovenia. In addition, evidence from earlier studies suggests that changes in diet and foraging behaviour due to supplemental feeding may affect several aspects of bear biology and in some cases increase the probability of human-bear conflicts. Thus, we caution against promoting unconditional supplemental feeding as a measure to prevent or reduce human-bear conflicts.","10.2981/wlb.00013","CE","CE_8020",244,0.378450309708663,0.104636116923908,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Unable to glide across the road, squirrels in the divided subpopulations faced reduced access to mates, den sites, and foraging grounds. We installed 3 pairs of modified wooden utility poles as crossing structures to enable gliding over the road in both directions. Using wildlife cameras, we monitored use of the crossing poles by northern flying squirrels for 15 months. Additionally, we tracked movements of 4 radiocollared northern flying squirrels between habitat patches and checked nest boxes for evidence of squirrels crossing the road. Cameras recorded 5 still images and 25 videos of northern flying squirrels on the crossing poles, with flying squirrels leaping across the road in 56% of videos. Crossings increased from 0 crossings in a previous study to 14 crossings in this study. For the first time since crossing-pole installation, squirrels used dens on the opposite side of the road from where they were initially captured and tagged. We believe that these structure-assisted road crossings in the Unicois are the first observed in a North American gliding mammal. Although northern flying squirrels used crossing poles to glide over a rural, low traffic, 2-lane road, further research should be conducted to determine whether this technique is applicable to different road types and other types of linear barriers in North America. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/wsb.249","CE","CE_8022",237,0.113402659160259,0.0819392129783349,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

In 2012 Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) implemented the national 10-year Conservation and Management Strategy for the Elephant in Kenya, which includes an action aimed at testing whether beehive fences can be used to mitigate humanelephant conflict. From 2012 to 2015, we field-tested the efficacy of beehive fences to protect 10 0.4-ha farms next to Tsavo East National Park from elephants. We hung a series of beehives every 10 m around the boundary of each farm plot. The hives were linked with strong wire. After an initial pilot test with 2 farms, the remaining 8 of 10 beehive fences also contained 2-dimensional dummy hives between real beehives to help reduce the cost of the fence. Each trial plot had a neighboring control plot of the same size within the same farm. Of the 131 beehives deployed 88% were occupied at least once during the 3.5-year trial. Two hundred and fifty-three elephants, predominantly 2045 years old entered the community farming area, typically during the crop- ripening season. Eighty percent of the elephants that approached the trial farms were kept out of the areas protected by the beehive fences, and elephants that broke a fence were in smaller than average groups. Beehive fences not only kept large groups of elephants from invading the farmland plots but the farmers also benefited socially and financially from the sale of 228 kg of elephant-friendly honey. As news of the success of the trial spread, a further 12 farmers requested to join the project, bringing the number of beehive fence protected farms to 22 and beehives to 297. This demonstrates positive adoption of beehive fences as a community mitigation tool. Understanding the response of elephants to the beehive fences, the seasonality of crop raiding and fence breaking, and the willingness of the community to engage with the mitigation method will help contribute to future management strategies for this high humanelephant conflict hotspot and other similar areas in Kenya.","10.1111/cobi.12898","CE","CE_8024",340,0.284271032915736,0.0720698369112535,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Oak savanna restoration projects are primarily driven by species closely linked to this habitat type, such as the federally endangered Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis). However, it is essential that other species are monitored during restoration. Small mammals, due to their importance in ecosystem function, are particularly useful to study. The United States Forest Service is currently conducting an oak savanna restoration in the Manistee National Forest in Lower Michigan using forest thinning and prescribed burning. To understand management impacts on small mammal communities, we live trapped small mammals in each of the mechanically thinned plots (i.e., bulldozer, masticator, and shear cutter) and control plots in five blocks over six years (2008-2013), as well as measured vegetation variables each year. Initially, we used a permutation multivariate analysis of variance (perMANOVA) to determine if there were treatment and year interactions for both small mammal community assemblages and vegetation variables. We then compared changes in small mammal diversity, relative abundance, and vegetation variables among treatments using exploratory randomized block design analysis of variances (ANOVAs). Canopy cover was significantly lower in bulldozer and shear cutter thinned plots than control plots five years following thinning. We observed significant treatment by year interactions in how the small mammal community responded. A large increase in relative abundance of white-footed mice occurred one year post-thinning in all treatments. Within 1-2 years of treatment, thirteen-lined ground squirrels and meadow jumping mice, both open-canopy grassland species became established on thinned plots. The retention of brush piles in bulldozer and shear cutter plots provided important refuge habitat for small mammals following thinning. Restoration efforts were beneficial to the small mammal community overall and promoted grassland species to immigrate into the restored area.","10.1016/j.foreco.2016.02.016","CE","CE_8036",301,0.235379791061255,0.18258565627841,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Poor calf survival was the primary cause of the population decline, largely because of predation of newborn calves by American black bear (Ursus americanus) and the non-native coyote (Canis latrans). This situation offered an opportunity to test the efficacy of preventative management options such as diversionary feeding and lethal removal of predators for improving calf survival. We monitored caribou calves (n = 536) in 4 calving areas (3 untreated, 1 treatment) for 2 years (20082009) followed by diversionary feeding of black bears and coyotes in 20102011 and lethal removal of coyotes in 20122013. We estimated calf survival for 70 days, the period calves and females remain on the calving grounds, and for 182 days, after which calves were considered recruited into the population. Calf survival was nearly constant over the 6-year study period on the untreated areas. Calf survival was initially lower on the treatment area compared to the untreated areas but increased substantially on the treatment area during the lethal removal period, especially during the initial 70-day period. Predation on calves by coyote decreased substantially during the lethal removal period. Diversionary feeding had little influence on survival rates. This study suggests that lethal removal of coyotes could be a viable management option for improving calf survival, but it is expensive and logistically challenging in remote field settings. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21174","CE","CE_8039",227,0.210761283057364,0.0393245439462011,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8040,2017,"Analyzing the past to understand the future: natural mating yields better reproductive rates than artificial insemination in the giant panda","Biological Conservation","Conservation breeding programs require active management and thus selection among various management alternatives is a common practice. As in the practice of adaptive management used in ecology, it is important to reduce uncertainty about the outcomes of various management actions. Ideally this evaluation will be done using a priori hypothesis testing, but retrospective analyses can provide important insights as to which methods work better than others. The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) conservation breeding program has a long history of active management and therefore is rich in potential lessons learned for panda and other endangered species breeding programs. Now self-sustaining and experiencing exponential growth, the panda population also provides sample sizes large enough to support rigorous statistical evaluation. A fundamental decision for any breeding program is whether to invest in development and application of assisted reproduction techniques or to promote natural mating. Here we analyze 21 years (19962016) of giant panda reproductive data from 304 insemination events to determine relative success rates of insemination methods and evaluate management strategies. The birth rate after natural mating was 60.7%, 50.6% for combined natural mating and artificial insemination techniques, and 18.5% for artificial insemination (AI). Within the combined insemination technique group, 81.8% of births could be attributed to the natural mating event with only 18.2% attributed to AI. These results suggest that while techniques for improving AI should continue to be explored and will play an important role for some conservation applications, behavioral and biological management to encourage natural mating should be the most important goal for conservation breeding of this species.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.09.025","CE","CE_8040",251,0.393088145735854,0.49503850428574,"300","positive","positive_300",0

We evaluated the effectiveness of a nest box program intended to offset clearing of hollow-bearing trees associated with a freeway upgrade in southern Australia. The offset targeted three threatened vertebrates: squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis), brown treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus) and superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii). Clearing led to the loss of 587 tree hollows and the offset was the placement of an equivalent number of nest boxes in nearby woodland (1:1 ratio). Of these, we monitored 324 nest boxes in six sample periods between 2010 and 2013, yielding 2485 individual checks of nest boxes. For the three target species, we found: (1) no records of nest box use by the superb parrot, (2) two records of the brown treecreeper (00.76% of accessible nest boxes used per survey period), and (3) seven records of use of nest boxes by the squirrel glider (02.1% of accessible nest boxes used per survey period). Rates of nest box use by the superb parrot and squirrel glider were markedly lower than rates of use of hollow-bearing trees observed in other investigations.

8043,2017,"The vacant planting: limited influence of habitat restoration on patch colonization patterns by arboreal marsupials in south-eastern Australia","Animal Conservation","Many key questions remain unresolved about how biodiversity responds to temporal increases in native vegetation cover resulting from extensive restoration efforts. We quantified occupancy and colonization probability of old growth, regrowth and planted woodland patches by arboreal marsupials within Australian agricultural landscapes subject to woodland restoration over an 11-year period. Our analyses focused on the common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula and common ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus. We found strong evidence of a gradient in occupancy levels ranging from highest in old growth woodland, approaching zero in plantings, with regrowth woodland intermediate between these two broad types of vegetation structure. Plantings were not occupied by either species at the outset of our investigation and were rarely colonized throughout the subsequent 10 years. We hypothesize that a lack of shelter sites in large old hollow-bearing trees is one of the key factors limiting the occurrence of plantings by cavity-dependent arboreal marsupials, suggesting a lag between planting establishment and the time required for plantings to become suitable habitat. We found the probability of colonization was positively related to the amount of vegetation cover in the surrounding landscape. Unexpectedly, colonization probability was not influenced by a temporal increase in woody vegetation cover surrounding a patch. A paucity of relationships between patch colonization and the temporal change in vegetation cover may be explained by the fact that most of the increased vegetation cover in our study landscapes over the past decade has resulted from establishment of plantings which are generally not suitable nesting habitat for arboreal marsupials. Our findings have key management implications such as emphasizing the value of old growth woodland for arboreal marsupials and of targeting restoration efforts around old growth and regrowth woodland patches, and the flawed notion of biodiversity offsets that allow replantings to compensate for clearing old growth woodland.","10.1111/acv.12316","CE","CE_8043",300,0.17308240083502,0.0734214101007063,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

In the locality of Santa María del Mar in Oaxaca, it inhabits open pastures, sharing habitat with domestic cattle (Bos taurus). We hypothesize that L. flavigularis prefers to establish its feeding and resting sites in pastures where cattle are present. Understanding interspecific relationships is of great importance to the establishment of appropriate management plans. We record radio-tagged and no radio-tagged jackrabbits that established their resting and feeding sites on pastures with presence and absence of cattle and a compositional analysis of habitat preference was conducted. This paper reports for the first time the preference of L. flavigularis to establish feeding (? = 0.8010, P = 0.0020) and resting sites (? = 0.6605, P = 0.016) in the pasture with the presence of cattle. Selection of these sites could be attributed to the fact that the presence of cattle can function as an alarm system against possible predators, while the cattle grazing could itself promote palatable species of Poaceae that form part of the diet of this leporid. This information is key to the establishment of future management plans for both species and their ecosystem. A long-term study is required in order to determine the feasibility of cattle and jackrabbit cohabitation. We propose that an efficient rotational grazing program, could contribute to the conservation of this jackrabbit population.","10.12933/therya-16-393","CE","CE_8051",236,0.307545609697636,0.186007851305365,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8052,2012,"Translocation of overabundant species: implications for translocated individuals","Journal of Wildlife Management","Effective management of overabundant animal populations is a difficult challenge for wildlife managers around the globe. Translocation is often considered a viable management tool, whereby individual animals are removed from areas of high population density and released in areas where densities are lower. Typically, the success of a translocation program is measured at the population source, with little attention given to the fate of translocated individuals. Here we use a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) translocation program from southeastern Australia as a case study to investigate the effects of translocation on individual animals. The koala is an iconic species that occurs at high densities in some parts of its southern range, leading to numerous conservation and animal welfare issues. Between 1997 and 2007 over 3,000 koalas from a high-density island population were captured, surgically sterilized, and translocated to the mainland. Annual post-translocation surveys at release sites revealed densities of â&0.4 koalas/ha, despite release densities of 1.0 koala/ha. Radiotracking studies indicate that low densities were because of both mortality and high dispersal of translocated individuals. We observed a mortality rate of 37.5% for translocated koalas in the first 12 months post-release. No deaths occurred among animals that were not sterilized and translocated. Translocated koalas moved greater distances than non-translocated animals. Monitoring of translocated individuals should be performed routinely during translocation programs for overabundant species. Due consideration must be given to what is an acceptable level of mortality for translocated individuals. Although often considered an ethically acceptable management technique (especially for iconic and charismatic species), translocation may not always be the best option from an animal welfare perspective. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

8053,2014,"Free housing for declining populations: optimizing the provision of artificial breeding structures","Journal for Nature Conservation (English 2002-)*","The improvement of habitat quality and reproductive success through the implementation of artificial breeding structures is one of the most widespread in situ conservation strategies applied to the recovery of declining wildlife populations. Several past studies have monitored the use of artificial breeding structures in the wild, but virtually none of them have investigated which demographic and environmental factors actually determine their effectiveness in facilitating reproductive success. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify those factors influencing breeding success in artificial structures. With this purpose we surveyed a declining population of a keystone species of Mediterranean ecosystems, namely the European wild rabbit. In Doñana National Park, we sampled during the course of two years the breeding success of wild rabbits from 47 artificial warrens, experimentally provided under different demographic and environmental conditions. In order to determine the relative importance of such factors, we applied an AIC model selection procedure to alternative biological hypothesis groups, postulating that breeding success in artificial structures would primarily depend on population density, food availability and/or predator limitation. We found that the efficiency of artificial warrens in facilitating rabbit reproductive success can vary, with an increase associated with greater pasture availability. Predator limitation by fencing also positively affected rabbit reproduction, but only in combination with high pasture availability. On their own, fencing treatment and population reinforcements had low and null effectiveness facilitating reproduction, respectively, as well as entailing significant economic and biological costs. The best way to improve breeding success in artificial structures, therefore, was through their strategic placement in potential high-quality habitats, i.e. with suitable pasture availability. We suggest that vegetation management can effectively increase carrying capacity and consequently the target species' reproductive success, especially in fast breeding species like the European wild rabbit. The provision of artificial breeding structures for conservation purposes may significantly benefit from the elaboration of concurrent experimental studies similar to the present research, which can help establish useful guidelines for optimizing future conservation efforts. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.","10.1016/j.jnc.2014.03.006","CE","CE_8053",331,0.509295636569313,0.334406030524077,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Eighteen animals were released and radiotracked between 2007 and 2012 for periods of 6-46 months, producing 1,181 locations. The effect of land use was assessed using chi-square tests. Resource selection functions were used to assess habitat selection at 2 spatial scales using as covariates habitat type (grassland, open savanna, closed savanna, and hygrophilous forest), distance to forest edge, and distance to a main road. Habitat selection was modeled for different ages (juveniles and adults), activity (resting or active), and seasons (summer, transition, and winter) and was validated with individuals previously excluded from our analysis. Anteaters strongly selected areas dedicated to nature conservation. Adults showed higher model fit. Hygrophilous forest was positively selected and open savanna was avoided. Anteaters rested almost exclusively in forests. While active they increased the use of other habitats, except for open savanna. Grasslands were most used during the winter season, probably because they provide a constant food source and better cover than savannas. Even though < 4% of the landscape was covered by forests, this habitat proved to be important for giant anteaters. Deforestation and traditional cattle management may have caused the local extinction of the species at Iberá. Establishment of strict conservation areas in nonflooded areas combined with proper management of forests and livestock may be essential for the long-term survival of reintroduced populations in Iberá and similar regions.","10.1093/jmammal/gyv107","CE","CE_8060",256,0.185288609967615,0.291113471685596,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Studies have shown that species select for different crossing structure designs, yet little is known about intraspecific variation (i.e., differences among demographic classes) in crossing structure preference. Using data on grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) movement in Banff National Park (AB, Canada), we focused on selection by family groups (adult females travelling with young) and singleton (adult male or female) bears for 5 crossing structure designs distributed among 44 sites. Using data from the world's longest running monitoring program (19972014) on wildlife crossing structure use, we created an economic model to estimate demographic-specific cost-effectiveness for each crossing structure design. We found that all grizzly bears selected larger and more open structures (overpasses and open-span bridges). Use of these structures has generally increased with time at a rate that exceeds estimates of population growth. Family groups were more selective than singletons and strongly selected overpasses. In spite of singletons selection for overpasses and open-span bridges, box culverts were comparable in cost-effectiveness. Our results suggest that structure designs targeting the selection of grizzly bear family groups are effective at restoring population connectivity, but a systematic approach to designing highway mitigation also would consider the role of lesser used structures in reducing intraspecific predation and multispecies connectivity targets. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/wsb.828","CE","CE_8067",229,0.214046917348184,0.0922694593220136,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

We document three trials where 6-12-m-high wooden poles, also known as glide poles, were installed to provide a link for gliding mammals across 50-75-m-wide canopy gaps, over open pasture or over roads. We used hair-traps over periods of 10-42 months to determine whether squirrel gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) used the poles. Squirrel glider hair was detected on at least one pole during 69-100% of sampling sessions. At two road locations where poles were installed on wildlife land-bridges, hair was detected on poles in the middle of the bridge in 7-18 sessions, suggesting that complete crossings may have occurred. At one road location a camera-trap recorded a squirrel glider ascending a middle pole on five of 20 nights.

The presence of hippopotamuses causes conflict with rice farmers as a result of crop damage and the absence of effective measures to protect crops. To develop an effective method for protecting rice fields, we studied the patterns of access to flooded and rain-fed rice fields by hippopotamuses and assessed the effect of the installation of electric fences. Hippopotamuses were detected in 54% of the flooded fields (n = 100) and in 31.9% of the rain-fed fields (n = 91). They were detected more frequently in fields on offshore islands than on the mainland, in unfenced than in fenced fields, and in fields closer to running water. Hippopotamuses entered fenced flooded fields less frequently than unfenced, and were detected most frequently at the end of the rainy season and the start of the dry season, and in the period of vegetative stem growth. Electric fences were an effective deterrent and facilitated increased rice production. The maintenance and cost of the electric fencing were acceptable to farmers, and therefore the use of such fencing is recommended to resolve the conflict between hippopotamuses and farmers in Guinea-Bissau and in other areas with similar conditions.","10.1017/S003060531500109X","CE","CE_8077",213,0.154132072085276,0.0144332849473233,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Maintaining canopy connectivity through preservation of connecting branches (i.e. natural canopy bridges) may help mitigate that impact. Using camera traps, we evaluated crossing rates of a pipeline right-of-way in a control area with no bridges and in a test area where 13 bridges were left by the pipeline construction company. Monitoring all canopy crossing points for a year (7,102 canopy camera nights), we confirmed bridge use by 25 mammal species from 12 families. With bridge use beginning immediately after exposure and increasing over time, use rates were over two orders of magnitude higher than on the ground. We also found a positive relationship between a bridge's use rate and the number of species that used it, suggesting well-used bridges benefit multiple species. Data suggest bridge use may be related to a combination of bridge branch connectivity, multiple connections, connectivity to adjacent forest, and foliage cover. Given the high use rate and minimal cost, we recommend all linear infrastructure projects in forests with arboreal mammal populations include canopy bridges.","10.1038/s41598-017-04112-x","CE","CE_8080",192,0.177740452837547,0.206095716800862,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Although some evidence suggests coyote control can improve recruitment, success appears to be site dependent. Therefore, we designed an experiment to assess feasibility of coyote control as a management action to increase recruitment on B.F. Grant and Cedar Creek Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) in central Georgia, USA. We estimated annual coyote abundance during 2010-2012 using a noninvasive mark-recapture design and fawn recruitment using infrared-triggered camera surveys. During March-June 2011 and March-April 2012, trappers removed coyotes from both sites. Estimates of coyote abundance on B.F. Grant WMA after trapping were 81% (2011) and 24% (2012) lower than during preremoval. Coyote abundance estimates were similar among years on Cedar Creek WMA. Fawn recruitment on B.F. Grant WMA averaged 0.65 fawns/adult female prior to removal and 1.01 fawns/adult female during the 2 years following the removals. Fawn recruitment on Cedar Creek WMA did not differ among years during the study, and was similar to that prior to coyote arrival. The differential coyote impacts and variable effectiveness of trapping we observed on nearby sites suggest coyote control may not achieve management objectives in some areas. Furthermore, transient behavior and the potential for coyotes to adapt to control efforts likely reduce efficacy of this management action. However, we observed an increase in recruitment on B.F. Grant WMA during one year, and others have seen similar responses. Therefore if lowered fawn recruitment is hindering achievement of management objectives, we recommend managers who opt to control coyotes continuously monitor recruitment to determine whether a response occurs.","10.1002/wsb.534","CE","CE_8083",280,0.169108683323805,0.164668736281839,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

From 27 July to 2 October 2010 in northcentral Montana, USA, we erected and maintained 7.7 km of electronet that enclosed 108 ha on portions of 2 prairie dog colonies. We monitored 2 female ferrets and 6 kits inside exclosures and 3 females and 12 kits outside of exclosures. Percent of coyote sightings in the protected areas was 6 times less than expected during the exclosure period (42% pre-exclosure, 7% exclosure, 47% post-exclosure). We conclude that the electronet fencing was effective for dramatically decreasing coyote activity in focal areas where black-footed ferret litters were being raised.We found evidence that survival of kits living primarily in protected areas was 22% higher, but we qualify this finding because of low sample sizes and because our monitoring activity on the study site may have influenced coyote activity.

Farmers used existing lethal control in the first year and switched to guardian animals (dogs Canis familiaris and alpacas Lama pacos) or livestock protection collars for the following 2 years. During the first year the mean cost of livestock protection was USD 3.30 per head of stock and the mean cost of depredation was USD 20.11 per head of stock. In the first year of non-lethal control the combined implementation and running costs were similar to those of lethal control (USD 3.08 per head). However, the mean cost of depredation decreased by 69.3%, to USD 6.52 per head. In the second year of non-lethal control the running costs (USD 0.43 per head) were significantly lower than in previous years and depredation costs decreased further, to USD 5.49 per head.

We also collected DNA samples from bears involved in incidents, and only 2 bears detected at intercept-feeding sites were detected also at a spring incident site. The intercept-feeding program was suspended in 2014 and 2015, and we did not detect an increase in spring livestock depredation. We estimated annual operating costs to be43,850 Canadian dollars (CAD); initial capital equipment investment was19,000 CAD. In total, approximately720,600 CAD has been spent on the intercept-feeding program between 1998 and 2013. Intercept feeding did not decrease spring livestock depredation; therefore, other mitigation efforts, including electric fencing and deadstock removal, might be a more cost-effective long-term solution.","10.2192/URSU-D-16-00026.1","CE","CE_8115",294,0.344925321899362,-0.051436187946499,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8116,2012,"Can predator avoidance training improve reintroduction outcomes for the greater bilby in arid Australia?","Animal Behaviour","Many threatened species' reintroductions in Australia fail because of predation by introduced cats and foxes. We attempted to improve reintroduction outcomes by training greater bilbies, . Macrotis lagotis, to recognize cats as predators. The movement and behaviour of trained and control bilbies were compared in both a predator-free environment and in an area where cats and foxes were present. Trained bilbies within the predator-free environment moved significantly further, used more burrows with more entrances and changed burrows more frequently than untrained control animals. Trained bilbies also moved burrows when presented with olfactory predator stimuli while control bilbies did not. However, when bilbies were reintroduced to an area where predators were present, there was no difference in survival, movement or burrow use between trained and control bilbies. Both groups exhibited high survival rates in the first 6. months after release. In the presence of predators, both trained and control bilbies appeared to be more predator-aware possibly because of control bilbies learning from trained conspecifics or cohabiting rabbits or through inadvertent contamination of control animals during training. Results suggest that bilbies can be taught to recognize exotic predators but this may not necessarily translate into improved reintroduction success in the wild. Further investigation into cultural and filial transfer of antipredator behaviour is recommended. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.01.023","CE","CE_8116",220,0.199351605280505,0.0509466531665473,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8117,2015,"Native wildlife use of highway underpasses in a desert environment","The Southwestern Naturalist","While highway underpasses and culverts are often identified in conservation planning as wildlife corridors, their success at facilitating connectivity in deserts has rarely been tested. We evaluated wildlife use of seven, pre-existing highway underpass structures and four associated canyon sites over 29 mo to identify spatial and temporal wildlife use patterns and to assess factors that may constrain wildlife use, particularly for native carnivore species. Our results indicate that a wide diversity of wildlife species utilize the underpass structures including rodents, lagomorphs, deer, and carnivores. Structural attributes of the underpasses have a minor influence on use by most observed species, although structural characteristics and human activity both contributed to determining bobcat (Lynx rufus) usage. Wildlife and human diel patterns differed between the underpass sites and their associated canyons. We suggest that providing a range of underpass structures to support use by a diversity of wildlife, as well as development or modification of underpasses to minimize human disturbance, will enhance landscape connectivity in desert systems.","10.1894/0038-4909-60.4.340","CE","CE_8117",164,0.172541540912788,0.118242990203704,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
8126,2015,"Black bear exclusion fences to protect mobile apiaries","Human Wildlife Interactions","Demand for commercial bee (Apis mellifera) services recently has increased, resulting in greater use of mobile apiaries for crop pollination. When commercial apiaries are moved into areas occupied by black bears (Ursus americanus), conflicts between beekeepers and bears sometimes occur. Commercial pollination often involves moving apiaries among agricultural fields, and, thus, permanent fencing is not a viable option for reducing damage by bears. In 2010, we tested the effectiveness of 4 temporary electric fence designs for excluding black bears from bait sites in northern Michigan. We determined the effectiveness of each fence design by observing bear behavior obtained from 24-hour video surveillance. From >433 minutes of bear-fence interactions (BFI), we recorded 168 BFIs in 73 visits by an estimated 15 bears. The only fence design deemed 100% effective at excluding bears consisted of 3 polytape strands charged with 5,000 V and spaced 0.58, 0.39, and 0.23 m from the ground, respectively. Proper fence construction and maintenance are critical elements of effectiveness, and we provide guidance on each.

8131,2017,"Wolf predation on cattle in Portugal: Assessing the effects of husbandry systems","Biological Conservation","Mitigating conflicts associated with predation on livestock is essential for conserving large carnivores in human dominated landscapes. This is generally addressed by targeting at individual management practices affecting predation risk, often disregarding that different livestock husbandry systems (i.e., groups of farms sharing similar resource bases, production patterns and management practices) with different vulnerabilities to predation may coexist within predator ranges, each of which requiring tailored prescriptions to reduce predation. Here we evaluated the importance of considering both husbandry systems and individual management practices to mitigate conflicts due to cattle predation by wolves in Portugal, where attacks on cattle increased > 3 times in 19992013. Government records from 2012 to 2013 indicated that only 10 attacks per year. We found that attacks were concentrated in the free-ranging husbandry system, which was characterized by multi-owner herds, largely grazing communal land far from shelter, and seldom confined. Protecting these herds at night in winter was the most important factor reducing wolf attacks, which could be achieved by changing practices of  25% of farmers in this system. Attacks were much lower in the semi-confined system, probably because herds grazed pastures closer to shelter, and they were often confined with fences or in barns. Farms bringing calves < 3 months old to pastures were associated with about 90% of attacks, but changing this practice would involve  50% of farmers in this system. Our results underline the importance of identifying livestock husbandry systems and to adjust mitigation strategies to each system.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.01.008","CE","CE_8131",238,0.201632768940175,0.0438723518657792,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8144,2011,"Effect of artificial warren size on a restocked European wild rabbit population","Animal Conservation","From the time since the decline of the wild rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus in southern Europe, various techniques and methods have been explored with a view to restoring wild rabbit populations or increasing rabbit resilience, for both conservation and game purposes. Rabbit restocking and habitat management are among the measures most often applied. Some efforts have been made to increase refuges for wild rabbits, mainly through the construction of artificial warrens. The present study evaluates the response of a wild rabbit population introduced to artificial warrens of varying sizes. This involves comparisons of the density of rabbits in the warrens, rabbit density change between seasons of low and high rabbit population density and the productivity index for large and small warrens in rabbit populations living under semi-natural conditions. Our results show that large warrens had higher rabbit abundance than had small warrens, but significantly lower rabbit density. No differences in density increase or productivity index were found with respect to warren size. The results suggest that it is preferable to build many small warrens for conservation of wild rabbit populations, but, in the event that only a few warrens are built, it is advisable that they be large. © 2010 The AuthorsAnimal conservation © 2010 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/j.1469-1795.2010.00401.x","CE","CE_8144",206,0.175388677638669,0.260665607853981,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Exports of hippopotamus trophies from Cameroon were suspended in 2012 but the species' status and population trends remain poorly known. Using the same methodology as in 2000 and 2008, we counted hippopotamuses in Faro National Park and bordering hunting zones in 2014.

The stability of this population contrasts with the declines in populations of large mammals across north-central Africa. We attribute this conservation success to private efforts (i.e. safari hunting) compensating for a decline in state protection. However, the situation remains fragile, as highlighted by an influx of transhumant cattle and gold diggers. We recommend increasing public-private conservation efforts, including incentives for the safari hunting industry, which is also under pressure.","10.1017/S0030605315001258","CE","CE_8147",147,0.181486709719555,0.0845588656329683,"150","neutral","neutral_150",0
8148,2017,"An evaluation of small-mammal use of constructed wildlife crossings in ski resorts","Wildlife Research","Context Infrastructure development in ski-resort areas has led to the modification of slopes and, often, the replacement of native plant species with exotic grasses. Modified ski slopes are effectively linear areas of disturbance that separate natural habitat and provide barriers to the movement of native animal species. To overcome these barriers, boulder-filled and culvert-style wildlife crossings have been constructed across disturbed ski slopes and under roadways to facilitate the movement of small native mammal species among areas of remnant habitat, but generally they differ in size and locality. The use of boulder-filled and under-road culvert crossings of different length has not been evaluated. Aims We determine whether fauna utilise wildlife crossings in ski resorts and whether variations in crossing length influence the species using the crossings. Methods We monitored boulder-filled crossings of two size classes (long or short) biannually from March 2009 to April 2013, using hair tubes. We monitored an additional two under-road culvert crossings with remote infrared cameras. Key results The results indicated that all crossings, regardless of size, are utilised by small mammals. However, we detected threatened species, such as Mastacomys fuscus (broad-toothed rat), more frequently in crossings of greater length. Conclusions To maintain linkages for small-mammal populations within ski resorts, we recommend the continued use of boulder-filled crossings on ski slopes. These crossings may be particularly important in facilitating the movement of small mammals across wide areas of ski-slope disturbance. Implications The context and maintenance of crossings is likely to be important for their long-term use by small mammals, as are complementary strategies to restore structural habitat connectivity on ski slopes, such as strategically implemented native vegetation plantings.","10.1071/WR16102","CE","CE_8148",282,0.137001703467385,0.135743606071844,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

As part of a reintroduction program, captive-bred brush-tailed rock-wallabies (BTRWs) (Petrogale penicillata) were hardened-off for at least three months before release into the Grampians National Park, western Victoria. A total of 41 animals were involved in the project, with the 24 selected for hardening-off aged between 1.1 and 4.3 years. In all, 21 animals have been released, with data from 11 collected from all sites (captive, hardening-off and reintroduced). At each site animals were periodically trapped, anaesthetised, physically examined, weighed, and blood sampled for haematological and biochemical data over three calendar years. All reintroduced animals were radio-collared. This study presents data across sites (167 samples), two seasons (winter/spring, 95 samples; summer/autumn, 72 samples), two different age groups (juveniles 1.25 years) and both sexes. Seventy percent of released BTRWs and 90% of sympatric macropodids were positive for macropod herpes virus; none of three BTRWs tested for toxoplasmosis was positive. Faeces were collected opportunistically for flotation and ectoparasites were collected and identified. While physical examinations with anaesthesia were safe and eliminated some animals from being released, they failed to detect all cases of oral cavity disease. A reference range of haematological and biochemical parameters have been established for this evolutionarily significant unit of BTRW. Lymphocyte/neutrophil ratios of released animals suggested that the main acute stressor is a handling phenomenon but the oxidative stress index suggested that animals were coping with their environment. Significant site differences were noted for several variables including red cell mass (red cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit), white cell count, lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio, albumin globulin ratio, creatinine, urate, ascorbic acid, a-tocopherol, retinol, cholinesterase, total carotenoids and oxidative stress index. Significant seasonal differences were noted for some variables, including red cell mass, ascorbic acid, albumin globulin ratio, cholinesterase, total carotenoids and retinol. Significant age differences were noted for red cell mass, albumin and dietary antioxidants. The only sex-related difference related to higher retinol levels in females. Those parameters related to diet, e.g. albumin, retinol, a-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, and total carotenoids were consistent with those found in other rock-wallabies. © 2011 Australian Mammal Society.","10.1071/AM11010","CE","CE_8149",375,0.164395913002151,0.0256223002525902,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Translocating wildlife is often not a preferred wildlife management technique because of the potential return and repeated capture of animals. Hundreds of bears are translocated in Wisconsin annually, but because anesthetizing, marking, and tracking individual bears is prohibited at the time of year that translocations occur, it is not known whether the same few bears are moved multiple times, or if a large pool of new bears continues to be trapped and translocated. To determine if bears are frequently recaptured, we used genetic techniques to identify translocated bears during 2006 and 2007. Of the 520 bears identified, very few (4%) were recaptured. Of the bears that were recaptured, most (71%) tended to return to within 10 km of their original capture locations.

Subsequent monitoring through to 2013 has revealed a small but healthy extant population that occupies all suitable habitat with some animals moving beyond the predator-free sanctuary to adjoining woodland patches. Possums occurred at a low density and had large home ranges relative to other studies at more mesic sites elsewhere. This is likely linked to the low productivity of the site (annual average rainfall of 332 mm) and one-way dispersal of young across the barrier fence. Possums preferentially occupied woodlands of York gum and salmon gum, utilised rock she-oak habitat, but made little use of shrubland and mallee habitats within the sanctuary. Female possums appeared to mature at an early age and to have young for much of the year. Recruitment was biased towards males in the first four years of establishment; although many appeared to rapidly disappear from the population. The success of this reintroduction is most likely linked to the initial release of possums into vacant habitat, the absence of foxes, and the ready availability of hollows in mature eucalypts and shelter sites in rock crevices.","10.1071/AM14005","CE","CE_8154",203,0.397376934851145,0.292241063254356,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Northern raccoon (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) exhibited lower crossing rates in culverts during winter than at other times of the year. We did not detect any diff erence in seasonal crossings for other species, but several species exhibited similar patterns of lower crossings/culvert/day during winter.

These practices affect multiple biotic and abiotic interactions mainly through loss of habitat and resources available for native wildlife. We examined the effects of local vegetation conditions on resource selection by a small mammal species in drylands with different resource availability. The study was conducted in a semi-arid woodland that included an area protected from livestock grazing and human settlement for more than 50 years, the Man and the Biosphere Ñacunán Reserve, and an adjoining area that has experienced long-term cattle grazing. We tracked radio-collared individuals of Graomys griseoflavus, the most abundant small mammal in the Ñacunán region, and calculated resource selection functions (RSFs) to evaluate habitat selection. We modeled resource selection using a suite of habitat variables measured in both areas. We hypothesized that long-term changes in vegetation associated with livestock grazing would substantially influence habitat selection. G. griseoflavus selected vegetation patches with relatively greater cover of forage species (i.e., taxa commonly consumed) and avoided open spaces; they also selected sites with greater species richness and cover of grasses and trees. Although resource selection patterns were generally similar under both management conditions (i.e., under passive restoration and grazing), the strength of selection was greater in the grazed area. The final RSF model validated well with k-fold cross-validation (R2 = 0.61). Because of the importance of rodents in ecosystem function, management to meet their resource requirements could be an important tool for habitat restoration in degraded drylands.","10.1093/jmammal/gyx106","CE","CE_8162",260,0.175105682440024,0.258327278524471,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

To help ameliorate this decline, green-tree retention (GTR) leaves large live trees after harvest to provide mature forest habitat and increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand. Aims To test the hypotheses (H) that, at 20 years after harvest, (H1) abundance, reproduction and survival of the southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi), as well as (H2) abundance and species diversity of the forest-floor small mammal community, would increase with the basal area (BA) and density of residual trees after harvest. Methods Small mammals were live-trapped in 2015-16 in replicated clearcut, dispersed retention, aggregated retention, patch cut and uncut forest sites in mixed forests of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia) in southern British Columbia, Canada. Key results Mean BA and density of overstory coniferous trees were significantly different at 20 years post-harvest, being higher on patch cut and uncut forest sites than on the clearcut and GTR sites. M. gapperi populations were significantly greater in aggregated retention and uncut forest sites than in the other sites, but demographic parameters were similar among sites, and therefore H1 was partly supported. Mean total abundance of small mammals differed significantly among sites, with the highest overall numbers occurring in the aggregated retention (16.2), clearcut (13.6) and uncut forest sites (11.9). Mean species richness and diversity were highest in the GTR and clearcut sites. Thus, H2 was not supported. Conclusions Recovery of M. gapperi in aggregated retention sites with 10m2 ha-1 BA of residual trees, as a group, occurred at 20 years post-harvest.

8177,2017,"Supplementary ungulate feeding affects movement behaviour of brown bears","Basic and Applied Ecology","Food availability plays a key role in animal movements. Anthropogenic provisioning of food to wildlife is a common practice of unprecedented magnitude worldwide and is of increasing conservation concern. Ungulate supplementary feeding is widespread in game management; however its effects on non-target species have received little attention. Here, we investigate how ungulate feeding affects the movement behavior of a non-target species, the brown bear (Ursus arctos). We tracked bear movements in the Northeastern Carpathians (1500 km2) and inventoried 212 ungulate feeding sites. We analyzed encounter rates of nine GPS-collared bears with ungulate feeding sites (1658 km, n = 49 tracks) and compared them with the corresponding encounter rate of simulated tracks. We also estimated the encounter rate with feeding sites using snow-tracking of unknown bears (232 km, n = 40 tracks). GPS-tracked bears encountered feeding sites three times more frequently (mean ± SE = 0.154 ± 0.022 per km travelled) than would be expected if they were moving randomly (0.054 ± 0.0010 per km random walk). The rate was even higher for snow-tracked bears, which visited on average 0.926 ± 0.271 feeding sites per kilometer travelled. This suggests a link between the winter activity of some individuals and their frequent use of feeding sites. Bears seemed to rely on spatial memory and patrol known sites, independent of whether food was available at the feeding sites. This alteration of the natural behavior of species with behavioral flexibility, such as brown bears, could be interpreted as a sign of environmental degradation. Our results demonstrate an important effect of ungulate feeding on the movement ecology of non-target species. We warn of the impacts of this practice on species and ecosystems and highlight the need to preserve natural movement behaviors and urgently reevaluate management practices involving food provisioning to wildlife.","10.1016/j.baae.2017.09.007","CE","CE_8177",284,0.189493578114857,0.0978272807179525,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Three species were recorded using canopy bridges: brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba clamitans Cabrera, 1940), white-eared opossum (Didelphis albiventris Lund, 1840) and porcupine (Sphiggurus villosus Cuvier, 1823). Rope bridges with the highest number of species recorded had more forest cover and lower urban area around them than overpasses little used. Our results indicate that overpasses, in Porto Alegre, work as a linear corridor between forest remnants, although the outcomes for individual survival, group persistence, population demography or gene flow have not been measured. Furthermore, canopy bridges may be important to mitigate the impact of roads and power lines on wildlife, but electric cables also need to be completely isolated when present, to warrant animals' physical integrity.",NA,"CE","CE_8179",268,0.212033754842061,0.111165612755108,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8203,2013,"Enhanced numbers of two temperate reef fishes in a small, partial-take marine protected area related to spearfisher exclusion","Biological Conservation","Reviews of global studies suggest that even small no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) can have localized benefits on harvested organisms of varying mobility. The generality of this conclusion, however, has been questioned due to poor experimental designs of some studies included in reviews, and the relatively small proportion of studies which focused on very small MPAs (=1km2). Here we use a correlative approach to test for possible effects of a 0.1km2 partial-take MPA (closed to spearfishing for 12.5years) on the abundance and size of key harvested fishes using an asymmetrical spatial comparison of the MPA vs. three unprotected control areas. Positive impacts were detected, despite our prediction that a small MPA would not provide protection to highly mobile taxa. Densities of legal-sized (=200mm SL) Cheilodactylus fuscus (red morwong; relatively sedentary) were 2.8 times greater within the MPA than at the controls and densities of legal-sized Acanthopagrus australis (yellow-fin bream; relatively mobile) were 2.3 times greater on shallow (=3.5m) but not deeper (4-12m) areas of reef within the MPA. While benefits of protection were evident, the cost-benefit of implementing similar MPAs should be carefully considered as the partial protection status and small size of the MPA limit both the adequacy of the MPA for protecting a larger range of species, and the magnitude and thus detectability of effects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2013.07.031","CE","CE_8203",223,0.283520875459208,0.167492048716095,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

However, no research has yet assessed the effectiveness of the RCA network at promoting groundfish population recoveries. We surveyed the fish communities of 35 RCAs and adjacent unprotected areas in southern British Columbia using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) between 2009 and 2011. We investigated the effect of protection and habitat on fish densities for six species or species groups (Quillback, Yelloweye, Greenstriped Rockfish, Kelp Greenling, Lingcod and all Inshore Rockfish combined) on transects inside and outside of RCAs. Habitat features such as percent rocky substrates and depth influenced fish density while reserve status did not. Next, we calculated habitat-based average densities and used the mean log response ratio (RR) of the density inside to outside of RCAs to determine if the amount of fishing outside the RCA, previous fishing history, the age, area or perimeter to area ratio influenced population recovery. Few positive reserve effects were apparent for any species/group. No clear patterns of RR with age were found for the RCAs, which ranged from 3 to 7 years old at the time of sampling (mean = 4.6). In addition, the intensity of fishing, size, and perimeter-to-area ratio failed to explain RR for most species. There were also no differences in size structure (length) of fish between RCAs and unprotected areas. The results give little indication that demersal fish populations have recovered inside the RCA system. Ongoing monitoring is essential to assess population recovery over time and evaluate the RCAs in terms of criteria such as habitat quality, habitat isolation and the level of compliance in order to enhance their effectiveness.","10.1016/j.fishres.2016.06.001","CE","CE_8205",289,0.317199366415472,0.0837795036644473,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

This study, based in the South-West Indian Ocean, evaluated the benefits of area closure to vulnerable fishery species, which have been depleted by overfishing. A controlled fishing survey was conducted seasonally between 2006 and 2011 in the Pondoland MPA on the East Coast of South Africa. The MPA includes a 400km2 no-take zone where all forms of vessel-based exploitation are prohibited. Three endemic sparids (slinger Chrysoblephus puniceus, Scotsman Polysteganus praeorbitalis and poenskop Cymatoceps nasutus) and one widely distributed serranid (yellowbelly rockcod Epinephelus marginatus) were chosen as study species. These are slow growing, high trophic level species, which are prominent on rocky reefs in the Pondoland area and have been depleted by overfishing. Relative abundance was estimated using catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and length frequency distributions were used to determine the size structure of fish populations. The relative abundance and the mean length of all four species were significantly greater in the no-take zone. Over the 5-year study period, CPUE of C. puniceus and C. nasutus in the no-take zone increased as did the mean length of all species, except C. nasutus. This study presents clear evidence that the Pondoland MPA no-take zone is providing insurance against the depletion of vulnerable fishery stocks in fished areas, thereby establishing the basis for the enhancement of adjacent fisheries. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2012.10.003","CE","CE_8208",249,0.225320909484686,0.0566855754503968,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The aims were to: (1) evaluate temporal variation of the artisanal fishing of common dentex (2000-2012); (2) compare and quantify catch rates, fishing techniques and catch composition for artisanal and recreational fisheries, and determine the influence of management measures by both activities; and (3) estimate the production of both artisanal and recreational fisheries. Fishery data were collected from different artisanal fishing surveys (onboard fishing vessels and landings) and recreational fishing surveys (roving). The gears with the highest rates of exploitation were longline (3554 g per 100 hooks) and Trolling (351 g boat-1 h-1 ±SE), respectively, for artisanal and recreational fishing. This study showed that catches by both activities were quantitatively higher in partially protected areas than outside them. Production estimations suggest that the recreational fishery contributes significantly to fishing mortality and that it can magnify the negative effects of artisanal fisheries.

Here,we present life-history data for cod sampled within and next to four of the five closed areas to test the hypothesis that closed areas benefit cod. We found a positive effect of closure status on cod age, length and growth for three of the four closed areas; contrary results for the fourth area (Jeffreys Ledge) may be due to recreational fishing pressure. Diet results were not consistent across closed areas, but for the two areas farthest from shore (Cashes Ledge and Closed Area II), cod tended to have higher gut fullness and higher trophic niche breadth (based on stable isotopes) inside vs. outside. Body shape analysis revealed a consistent effect of closure status on cod morphometry with cod inside closed areas exhibiting less streamlined bodies. We discuss this apparent selection for more sedentary cod with lower productivity potential but highlight the demographic result (i.e. higher age and greater size inside closed areas) as critical considerations for resource managers that are designing or altering the configuration and/or scale of closed areas to protect and rebuild demersal fish species.","10.1093/icesjms/fsv215","CE","CE_8211",210,0.144795276589081,0.269452702844517,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The scheme was expanded in 2009, building on the initial elements of real-time closures (RTCs) and gear requirements. Various measures were agreed in a co-management framework involving fishers, non-governmental organizations, government officials, and scientists. The main objective was to encourage cod avoidance and the reduction of cod discards using spatial tools such as RTCs and seasonal closures, along with gear options that reduce cod capture. The scheme was incentivized by rewarding participation with additional days at sea. Real-time monitoring was carried out with extensive use of fishery-dependent information, allowing management to be adapted as required and to address emerging problems. The use of vessel monitoring system data, logbook records, fishers' knowledge, and observer data is described in terms of implementing and assessing the scheme. Compliance with the closure elements of the scheme was judged to have been good, and estimated catch rates by the Scottish fleet met target criteria, but the assessed catch savings of cod from RTCs were less than predicted.

8223,2013,"Supplementing electronic tagging with conventional tagging to redesign fishery closed areas","Fisheries Research","Fishery closed areas provide a resource management tool to protect predictable spawning aggregations of migratory fish species. Movement by individual fish however challenges the effectiveness of fishery closed areas. Recent developments in electronic tags and movement modelling offer new information to quantify fine-scale usages of fishery closed areas by free-ranging individuals. Conventional tagging data, on the other hand, inform on population broad-scale distribution patterns with respect to closed areas. Using the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) population from the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence as a case study, we demonstrate how electronic tagging experiments can be supplemented with conventional tagging experiments to evaluate and redesign fishery closed areas. A geolocation model was used to estimate time of arrival, time of departure, and proportion of time that individual cod equipped with data-storage tags spent within a fishery closed area. Two optimization algorithms were developed to seek out the spatial and temporal designs that maximized the proportion of time that the fish equipped with data-storage tags spent inside the closed area, relative to its size and duration. Bootstrap analyses quantified the effects of inter-individual variability in closed area usages. Conventional tagging data were used to estimate the proportion of the spawning population density function encompassed by the closed area. Results from the electronic and conventional tagging experiments suggested that the fishery closed area in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence should be displaced south along the 200-m isobath and that the enforcement period be reduced. Electronic tagging data also suggested that alternative migratory behaviours within a population lead to disproportional levels of protection between migratory and non-migratory groups. A re-examination of past conventional tagging experiments in combination with recent electronic tagging experiments provides new information to evaluate the spatiotemporal design of fishery closed areas. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2013.08.013","CE","CE_8223",302,0.21087062871811,0.125658628880489,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
8224,2014,"Changes in the spear fishery of herbivores associated with closed grouper season in Palau, Micronesia","Animal Conservation","Several species of coral reef herbivorous fish and groupers (Serranidae) are among the main targets of Micronesian spearfishers. Since 1994, a closed season (April-July) protects spawning aggregations of five grouper species in Palau, and, although this regulation may affect fishers targeting behaviour towards herbivores and increase their catch levels, the extent of these effects was previously unknown. This study conducted market surveys and interviews to examine if the closed grouper season in 2009 had any effect on herbivore spearfishing catches, or caused changes in the targeting behaviour of fishers. Catch volumes of the most desirable herbivores were unaffected by the grouper season, but the catch per unit effort of herbivores regularly caught opportunistically (i.e. if seen) or avoided raised by 45% during the grouper closure. The size composition of the catch of the bluespine unicornfish Naso unicornis during the grouper closure was significantly skewed to smaller sized fish due to the high proportion of immature individuals. Further investigation is required to clarify whether this pattern emerged because fishers had relaxed size selectivity during the closure or due to a paucity of adults in July. Fifty-seven per cent of the interviewed fishers indicated that while groupers would be their first choice during open season, N.unicornis would become their preferred target during the closure, and that other herbivores were also more likely to be targeted. This study took an important step in identifying a factor driving short and acute changes in the herbivore catch composition. Further efforts should be directed to quantify the ecological implications of the observed changes and determine if these are aggravated by the life-history traits or functional roles of the focal species. Relaxed species selectivity might emerge elsewhere, if inherently selective fishing methods are used and highly prized targets are temporarily or permanently banned, or overfished to critical levels. Such implications should be considered when assessing the sustainability of local fisheries. © 2013 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/acv.12066","CE","CE_8224",320,0.256819282630928,0.034388574479568,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
8225,2015,"Evaluating the effectiveness of a seasonal spawning area closure","ICES Journal of Marine Science","Fish that aggregate at predictable locations and times to spawn are often vulnerable to over-exploitation. Seasonal closures have often been implemented in an attempt to alleviate such impacts but the effectiveness of these measures is rarely tested. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a spawning closure for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Firth of Clyde off the Scottish West Coast (ICES Area VIa). This closure was introduced in March 2001 as an emergency measure to allowas many cod as possible to spawn and avoid the build-up of displaced effort from another spawning closure. Genetic, tagging, and otolith microchemistry investigations indicate that cod inhabiting the Clyde are reproductively isolated from other resident groups in the central and northern part of the Scottish WestCoast stock. This study used a beyond-Before-After, Control-Impact approach to compare population trends of the Clyde spawning aggregation before and after the introduced area closure, using two other sub-population spawning grounds as control areas. There was no evidence of local recovery in terms of abundance, biomass, or reduced mortality in the Clyde more than a decade after establishing the closure. Mortality mayhave remained high because young cod are still caught as bycatch in the Nephrops fishery in the area and the predation rate may have increased due to an expanding whiting population. Considering the state of the already severely depleted Clyde sub-population when the closure was implemented the measure appears to have been too little and too late. The tendency to implement such spawning closures on nearly collapsed stocks may be why these measures often appear to have been ineffective.","10.1093/icesjms/fsv144","CE","CE_8225",268,0.302953149506106,-0.00469065170844434,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8226,2015,"Effects of seasonal closures in a multi-specific fishery","Fisheries Research","In input-controlled multi-specific fisheries, seasonal closure has little biological rationale as a management measure, because it is difficult to adjust such closure for many target species and, in most cases, they are adopted for economic purposes. We aimed to determine effects of closure in biologic and economic terms, using 10-year landing data from two representative trawling ports of the Western Mediterranean: Dénia and La Vila Joiosa. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to detect significant differences, before and after the closure, in standardized catch per unit effort (CPUE) at different seasons and sale prices at home/closed and neighbour/open ports. ANOVAs showed significantly higher CPUE after the closure for total landings and Mullus spp. of the Red mullet métier, Merluccius merluccius CPUE (in two years) and the total landings of the Norway lobster métier. On the contrary, significant lower values were observed after the closure for total CPUE (in early summer) and Aristeus antennatus of Red shrimp métier. Similar CPUE was observed at all levels when the closure took place in late summer. In economic terms, market prices of target species have decreased or shown no changes after the closure at home/closed and neighbouring/open ports. The only exception was the significant increase of the price for A. antennatus in Dénia during the closure in La Vila Joiosa. Depending on its timing, the closure would highlight some positive biological effects on some target species. However, closure leads to an unavoidable reduction in most of target species prices. An alternative management measure that is based on effort reduction in input-controlled multi-specific fisheries could ban one day per week when market prices of target species are lower.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.07.027","CE","CE_8226",281,0.105059518821365,-0.000917033360086032,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Community composition differed between coral-dominated reefs and those covered mainly by algae and sponges, but not among treatments. Larger size classes were significantly diminished in unprotected areas compared to protected and sanctuary zones.

We conclude that partial protection does not effectively conserve reef fish, and there are indications that partly protected areas concentrate fishing effort on 'pelagic' gamefish. Sanctioned shore-angling and offshore 'gamefishing', illegal fishing and diver disturbance may collectively undermine the efficacy of partially protected areas.

A probabilistic sampling design produced precise estimates of population metrics of more than 250 exploited and non-target reef fishes. During the survey period more than 8100 research dives utilizing SCUBA Nitrox were optimally allocated using stratified random sampling. The survey domain covered 326km2, comprised of eight reef habitats in four management areas that offered different levels of resource protection: the Tortugas North Ecological Reserve (a NTMR), Dry Tortugas National Park (recreational angling only), Dry Tortugas National Park Research Natural Area (a NTMR), and southern Tortugas Bank (open to all types of fishing). Surveys detected significant changes in population occupancy, density, and abundance within management zones for a suite of exploited and non-target species. Increases in size, adult abundance, and occupancy rates were detected for many principal exploited species in protected areas, which harbored a disproportionately greater number of adult spawning fishes. In contrast, density and occupancy rates for aquaria and non-target reef fishes fluctuated above and below baseline levels in each management zone. Observed decreases in density of exploited species below baseline levels only occurred at the Tortugas Bank area open to all fishing.

Large species disappeared leaving a community dominated by small, fast-growing and young-to-mature species. After completion of reclamation, some large and medium species returned, but soon after the establishment of MPAs, medium-sized, fast-growing and young-to-mature species thrived on reduction of fishing pressure, and filled the guilds rapidly.

Few studies, however, have been designed explicitly to test how these factors influence the abundance trajectories of key species within sanctuaries. Diver surveys on reef habitat were conducted within a subtropical marine park in eastern Australia, to test for differences in abundances of targeted fishes between sanctuaries differing in size and age and compared with fished zones. Four management zones were sampled: (i) small sanctuaries established 1991 ( 100 ha of reef and > 500 m wide); (iii) zones which allowed recreational fishing but not commercial fish trapping (>200 ha of reef); and (iv) zones which allowed both recreational fishing and commercial fish trapping (>200 ha of reef). Multiple sites in each management zone were sampled for selected taxa eight times during the austral winter from 2002 to 2012. Many of the targeted taxa examined were more abundant in large sanctuary sites within a few years of the establishment of protection compared with the small sanctuary sites and the fished sites. Red morwong Cheilodactylus fuscus increased in large sanctuaries but were more abundant in the older smaller sanctuaries throughout the study. Similar increases were not observed in fished zones. There was considerable variability among years not associated with management type, including a peak in abundance for several species in 2005 and reduced abundance of many taxa following a destructive storm in 2009. This study provides strong empirical evidence that size and age of no take areas are important for fish, and indicates that larger sanctuaries can rapidly reach levels of fish abundance similar to smaller older sanctuaries. ï¿½ 2015 Commonwealth of Australia.","10.1002/aqc.2600","CE","CE_8235",274,0.277905642440783,0.172929433782746,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Fish were visually censused in shallow rocky habitat (4-7 m depth) at replicate sites within the different MPA zones and in adjacent unprotected areas. Higher values of sea breams size, density and biomass were usually observed inside MPA compared to unprotected areas, likely due to the enforcement of protection. We found evidence of negative gradients of sea bream density and biomass across the MPA boundaries, although shape and steepness of gradients changed depending on species, sampling time and boundary orientation. Fish density and biomass decreased abruptly just 100. m outside the MPA and remained close to zero off the western boundary. A partial recovery in fish density was recorded eastward, about 1 km apart from the MPA boundary.

Between 2001 and 2013, 6 613 fish from 71 species, caught by hook and line, were tagged at four sites within and adjacent to a no-take marine sanctuary area. A total of 1 004 (15.2%) recaptures were made from 17 species. The majority (82.4%) of these species displayed station-keeping behaviour, whereas only three were classified as wider-ranging species, and no species with discernible migratory behaviour was observed. Findings for five species with the highest recapture rates, namely Pomadasys furcatus, Epinephelus andersoni, E. marginatus, Dinoperca petersi and Lutjanus rivulatus, are presented in greater detail. Recapture rates ranged from 7% to 50% and time at liberty from 0 to 3 163 days. Individuals of all five species displayed station-keeping behaviour, with the 95th percentile of intra-study-site movements varying between 200 and 1 025 m (linear distance). However, four of the five species also displayed some ranging behaviour and made exploratory excursions ranging from 3.5 to 125 km, in both northerly and southerly directions. The dominance of station-keeping behaviour suggests that the St Lucia Marine Reserve sanctuary zone provides an important refuge for these species, with some export to adjacent areas.","10.2989/1814232X.2015.1023220","CE","CE_8244",218,0.221397330916455,0.12787413806098,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8246,2015,"Impact of conservation areas on trophic interactions between apex predators and herbivores on coral reefs","Conservation Biology","Apex predators are declining at alarming rates due to exploitation by humans, but we have yet to fully discern the impacts of apex predator loss on ecosystem function. In a management context, it is critically important to clarify the role apex predators play in structuring populations of lower trophic levels. Thus, we examined the top-down influence of reef sharks (an apex predator on coral reefs) and mesopredators on large-bodied herbivores. We measured the abundance, size structure, and biomass of apex predators, mesopredators, and herbivores across fished, no-take, and no-entry management zones in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. Shark abundance and mesopredator size and biomass were higher in no-entry zones than in fished and no-take zones, which indicates the viability of strictly enforced human exclusion areas as tools for the conservation of predator communities. Changes in predator populations due to protection in no-entry zones did not have a discernible influence on the density, size, or biomass of different functional groups of herbivorous fishes. The lack of a relationship between predators and herbivores suggests that top-down forces may not play a strong role in regulating large-bodied herbivorous coral reef fish populations. Given this inconsistency with traditional ecological theories of trophic cascades, trophic structures on coral reefs may need to be reassessed to enable the establishment of appropriate and effective management regimes.","10.1111/cobi.12385","CE","CE_8246",230,0.342211942380432,0.0690477209389157,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Although 90% of the total marine protected area in the Philippines is considered partially protected, no studies have focused on the effectiveness of latter areas in this region. Potential benefits of a partially protected marine area for fishes was investigated by comparing the species richness and abundance of commercially important fishes in this area with those in a fully protected area and adjacent unrestricted fishing ground in San Miguel Island, eastern Philippines. Fishing is forbidden in the fully protected area. Fishing activities in the partially protected marine area and open fishing area were also investigated through interviews with local fisherman. Species richness and abundance in the completely protected zone were significantly higher than those in the partially protected and open fishing areas; however, no difference was found between the partially protected and open fishing areas. Similarly, fishing pressure indices (e.g., fishing time, catch, and gear type) between the partially protected and open fishing areas were not different. Overall, full protection of a marine area confers greater benefits than partial protection; however, under high fishing pressure, partially protected areas are rendered less effective than an open fishing zone. Although this study was conducted at a single location, the results raise awareness of the issue of partially protected area management and highlight importance of establishing well designed partially protected areas in this country.","10.1016/j.rsma.2015.11.002","CE","CE_8247",255,0.263982386519159,0.396004811483142,"300","positive","positive_300",0
8248,2017,"A test of trophic cascade theory: fish and benthic assemblages across a predator density gradient on coral reefs","Oecologia","Removal of predators is often hypothesized to alter community structure through trophic cascades. However, despite recent advances in our understanding of trophic cascades, evidence is often circumstantial on coral reefs because fishing pressure frequently co-varies with other anthropogenic effects, such as fishing for herbivorous fishes and changes in water quality due to pollution. Australias outer Great Barrier Reef (GBR) has experienced fishing-induced declines of apex predators and mesopredators, but pollution and targeting of herbivorous fishes are minimal. Here, we quantify fish and benthic assemblages across a fishing-induced predator density gradient on the outer GBR, including apex predators and mesopredators to herbivores and benthic assemblages, to test for evidence of trophic cascades and alternative hypotheses to trophic cascade theory. Using structural equation models, we found no cascading effects from apex predators to lower trophic levels: a loss of apex predators did not lead to higher levels of mesopredators, and this did not suppress mobile herbivores and drive algal proliferation. Likewise, we found no effects of mesopredators on lower trophic levels: a decline of mesopredators was not associated with higher abundances of algae-farming damselfishes and algae-dominated reefs. These findings indicate that top-down forces on coral reefs are weak, at least on the outer GBR. We conclude that predator-mediated trophic cascades are probably the exception rather than the rule in complex ecosystems such as the outer GBR.","10.1007/s00442-016-3753-8","CE","CE_8248",232,0.212649532185428,0.085811581276578,"250","neutral","neutral_250",1

The movements of individual smoothhound sharks Mustelus mustelus in, and adjacent to, a small (34 km2) no-take MPA (Langebaan Lagoon Marine Protected Area; LMPA) situated on the west coast of South Africa were investigated over two years using acoustic telemetry. Sharks spent the majority of the time (in hours, average 79%) inside the reserve, and some sharks (n = 2 of 15 recorded during a full year) did not leave the reserve during the study period. Time spent inside the LMPA and the number of crossings of its boundary were strongly influenced by season. Sharks concentrated inside the LMPA during summer, whereas they were widely distributed throughout the study area during winter. Six sharks left the Saldanha Bay embayment during spring and winter for durations ranging from two to 156 days (median = 111 days). All returned to the bay within the study period. Individuals recorded over two years showed consistency in behavioural patterns and protection by the LMPA between years, and spent an average of 74% and 80% of the time inside the LMPA during the two study years respectively.

Reserves are gazetted in estuaries to offset impacts from burgeoning human populations, however, coastal conservation cannot be optimized because their effectiveness is rarely evaluated. We surveyed 220 sites in 22 estuaries in the Moreton Bay Marine Park, Queensland, Australia, including all six current estuarine marine reserves within the park. Fishes were surveyed using one hour deployments of baited remote underwater video stations twice at each site over consecutive days. We show that although the estuarine reserves in Moreton Bay contain a significantly different fish community, they fail to enhance the abundance of harvested fish species. We posit that performance is limited because reserves protect unique spatial features, or conserve narrow estuaries with weak connections to mangrove habitats and the open sea. Consequently, reserves as currently positioned protect only a subset of potential environmental conditions present for fish within the region, and potentially support residual estuarine habitats (i.e. expansive intertidal flats or shallow creeks) which are not particularly significant to either fish or fishers. We argue that reserve effectiveness can be improved by conserving deeper estuaries, with diverse habitats for fish and strong connections to the open sea. Without incorporating these critical spatial considerations into estuarine reserve design, estuarine reserves are doomed to fail.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.03.027","CE","CE_8257",228,0.289103997529786,0.0509666899637579,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

On average, the total biomass, density and body size of species increased inside marine reserves but species richness did not. The magnitude and direction of the responses in particular reserves varied depending on the species and trophic group considered, suggesting that indirect effects and trophic cascades might be important processes in the community-wide response to protection. Our analysis at the species level showed that most species increased in density inside reserves and that the fish response was greater than that of the invertebrate response, which was more variable. We also found a positive relationship between recovery of particular species and their individual level of exploitation intensity outside the reserve but found no such relationship with species body size, mobility, trophic level or resilience (population doubling time). Moreover, our analysis revealed that the response to protection was unaffected by the size, years of protection or area surveyed of the reserve, but there was a negative relationship with the number of species sampled in the studies. Our results also showed that the number of publications on marine reserve performance in Latin America and the Caribbean is still limited and the distribution is geographically uneven. We suggest that a stronger focus on both target species and the suite of other interacting species will allow better estimates of the community-wide effects of protection. © Inter-Research 2011.",NA,"CE","CE_8259",247,0.268763928117054,0.157357759245327,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Here, we investigate sex-and size-selectivity of the fishery for corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops) in Western Norway. The males that build and guard nests (nesting males) grow faster than females and sneaker males. Corkwing wrasse were tagged (n=1057) during (May-June) and after (July) the spawning period in 2014 within a no-Take site and in a nearby site open for fishing. We monitored the fishery within and nearby the tagging sites from June to October and sampled recaptures on all commercial fishing trips. Fishing mortality was higher for nesting males than for females (open site; tagged during spawning: 36% vs. 29%; after spawning: 49% vs. 36%) and was found to be caused by nesting males having higher capture probabilities than females, independently of body size. The fishing mortality of sneaker males did not differ from nesting males, but the sample of sneaker males in the study was small. The probability of being retained by fishers once captured depended on size, but not on sex. The small no-Take site reduced fishing mortality, and the sex-and size-selectivity was similar to the open site. By demonstrating the capture process to be male-selective in a commercial fishery, our study highlights the importance of assessing sex-selectivity in similar fisheries. If detected, management measures protecting the sexes more equally should be implemented, such as slot-size limits and marine-protected areas large enough to account for sexual differences in spatial behaviour.","10.1093/icesjms/fsw221","CE","CE_8262",257,0.201938027913707,0.144849407829296,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

As juveniles of the species utilize shallow, near shore habitat, they are particularly susceptible to anthropogenic impacts. The abundance, size characteristics, growth, condition factor and movement patterns of juvenile lemon sharks within the Bell Sound Nature Reserve were compared with those outside the Reserve. Sharks were more abundant within the Reserve, which also accommodated a greater proportion of smaller size classes. Although there was no difference in linear growth-rate between sharks inside and outside the Reserve, those outside exhibited higher condition factor values. It is suggested that these results are due mainly to habitat preference on the part of the sharks, with the predominantly shallower near shore waters of the Reserve offering a greater level of protection from predation. Regardless of the causative factor, the area occupied by the Bell Sound Nature Reserve appears to be highly important to the local juvenile lemon shark population.

Marine reserves can regulate how human activities alter fish communities and increase the abundance of targeted species, but the combined influence of reserves and seascape context on species habitat use remains uncertain in many ecosystems. Further, marine reserve effectiveness might be low for mobile species if the size of the reserve is less than a species usual range, reducing the overall time a individual may be protected. In this study, we tracked 19 giant shovelnose rays (Glaucostegus typus), an IUCN listed vulnerable species within the Moreton Bay Marine Park in eastern Australia. We used an array of 28 acoustic receivers within a complex mosaic of seagrass patches, bare sand, mangrove forests and deep-water channels and used regression tree analyses to determine which spatial, temporal and protection factors contributed most to G. typus habitat use. Overall, 50% of the total detections in the study occurred inside marine reserves containing large seagrass beds (>7.09 m 2) and in close proximity to mangroves ( 20.2 °C), the habitat use of individuals is contained in smaller centres of activity compared with winter, however, protection effects varied. Our results show that seascape context and marine reserves combine to provide the optimal areas for G. typus habitat selection. Limited food resources likely caused larger centres of activity during winter. Identifying priority habitats for vulnerable species is critical for ongoing protection and maintaining effective conservation initiatives. We have shown here that incorporating spatial features into the design of marine reserves can improve conservation outcomes for mobile benthic predators such as G. typus and other species that use such seascapes.","10.1093/icesjms/fsx192","CE","CE_8264",285,0.260322943528811,0.246302548527866,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

There is a lack of information on the mechanisms and effectiveness of this management system in meeting fisheries and ecosystem sustainability goals.A before-after-control-impact (BACI) pair design, was used to quantify flight initiation distance (FID), and biomass of two fishery-target (Acanthuridae and Scaridae) and one non-target (Chaetodontidae) families in two periodically harvested closures, two no-take marine reserves, and two open fished areas, prior to and after harvest of the periodically harvested closures. Creel surveys were used to quantify catch per unit effort (CPUE) in open fishing grounds, and during the periodic harvests.Before harvest, FID of targeted families was higher in fished areas than periodically harvested areas. After harvest, Acanthuridae FID in periodically harvested closures increased significantly to beyond the maximum effective range of spearguns. Total biomass of fishes was lower in fished areas than areas under either type of management. Acanthuridae biomass in the periodically harvested closures was similar to fished areas, and lower than in the no-take reserves. There was no difference post-harvest for either total or Acanthuridae biomass.CPUE was higher for fishing trips inside the periodically harvested closures than regular fishing activities. Fishes were generally larger in catches from periodically harvested closures, but this was not sufficient to account for the increase in CPUE, particularly of the Acanthuridae, which were significantly more abundant in the harvest catch.When fishes are protected temporarily from fishing, their wariness decreases, which makes them more easily catchable when fishing is reinstated. This study shows that fish behavioural change is an important and overlooked benefit of periodically harvested closures. However, differences in the magnitude of behavioural changes between fishery-target families may result in contrasting outcomes of periodically harvested management regimes.","10.1002/aqc.2388","CE","CE_8265",306,0.227089198081289,0.14837248960644,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Here, we measured the wariness of two families of coral reef fishes in both fished areas and marine reserves embedded within a fished seascape along an exploitation gradient ranging from wilderness sites (Chagos) to heavily fished areas (the Philippines). We used linear mixed effect models to identify relationships between fish flight initiation distance (FID) and fishing pressure, fish size, habitat complexity and life-history stage. Critically, fish FID increased with fishing pressure both in fished areas and inside marine reserves.

8272,2015,"Biomass-based targets and the management of multispecies coral reef fisheries","Conservation Biology","The failure of fisheries management among multispecies coral reef fisheries is well documented and has dire implications for the 100 million people engaged in these small-scale operations. Weak or missing management institutions, a lack of research capacity, and the complex nature of these ecosystems have heralded a call for ecosystem-based management approaches. However, ecosystem-based management of coral reef fisheries has proved challenging due to the multispecies nature of catches and the diversity of fish functional roles. We used data on fish communities collected from 233 individual sites in 9 western Indian Ocean countries to evaluate changes in the site's functional composition and associated life-history characteristics along a large range of fish biomass. As biomass increased along this range, fish were larger and grew and matured more slowly while the abundance of scraping and predatory species increased. The greatest changes in functional composition occurred below relatively low standing stock biomass (<600 kg/ha); abundances of piscivores, apex predators, and scraping herbivores were low at very light levels of fishing. This suggests potential trade-offs in ecosystem function and estimated yields for different management systems. Current fishing gear and area restrictions are not achieving conservation targets (proposed here as standing stock biomass of 1150 kg/ha) and result in losses of life history and ecological functions. Fish in reefs where destructive gears were restricted typically had very similar biomass and functions to young and low compliance closures. This indicates the potentially important role of fisheries restrictions in providing some gains in biomass and associated ecological functions when fully protected area enforcement potential is limited and likely to fail. Our results indicate that biomass alone can provide broad ecosystem-based fisheries management targets that can be easily applied even where research capacity and information is limited. Of particular value, is our finding that current management tools may be used to reach key ecosystem-based management targets, enabling ecosystem-based management in many socioeconomic contexts.","10.1111/cobi.12430","CE","CE_8272",320,0.131845805313707,-0.0118274182304976,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Closure from fishing was predicted to result in the recovery of predatory fish and herbivores, herbivory rates, and subsequently reduce erect algae and lead to the recovery of herbivore resistant and calcifying taxa such as hard corals and calcifying algae. Recovery of predatory fishes was the largest response to closure and the herbivore response was weak and no corals and calcifying algae changed in the predicted direction. Hard corals declined where they were most abundant and all sites appear to have reached a stable point of ~15% cover by the end of the study. Generalized and possibly opportunistic carnivores, such as jacks, barracuda, groupers, snappers, grunts, and sparids showed the greatest increases and there was a trend towards more small-bodied herbivores such sea urchins and damselfish in the open and a slight gain in large herbivores in the closed area, but this had little effect in increasing total herbivory. Factors that may have influenced this unexpected response include: (1) a complex food web that did not produce a simple cascade response; (2) attenuation of the cascade effect towards the lower trophic levels; (3) insufficient compliance, closure time, and space; (4) a post- rather than pre-disturbance establishment of the closure; 5) habitat or site specificity; and (6) overriding environmental disturbances, such as oceanographic oscillations and a warming climate.

8278,2011,"Putting marine sanctuaries into context: a comparison of estuary fish assemblages over multiple levels of protection and modification","Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems","In recent decades there has been a significant effort to establish marine sanctuaries for the purpose of protecting marine biodiversity and ecological processes. While many studies have demonstrated that marine sanctuaries increase the abundance, diversity, and trophic level of marine fish communities, few have compared these parameters across multiple levels of protection and human modification. This study utilized baited remote underwater video to compare fish assemblages between marine parks, between different levels of protection within parks (sanctuary and habitat protection zones), and between parks and highly modified systems with similar ecological communities. It was demonstrated that sanctuary zones have higher abundance of targeted fish species compared with other areas within some marine parks. The total abundance of targeted species and abundances of some key fisheries species (e.g. pink snapper) were found to be higher in sanctuary zones. This suggests that increased protection may be effective at improving these aspects of the fish assemblage. However, when marine parks were compared with highly modified environments it was found that targeted species were much more abundant in the highly modified systems. Community composition of entire fish assemblages also differed between these levels of modification and economically important fisheries species contributed most to this difference.

8282,2015,"Community assemblages of commercially important coral reef fishes inside and outside marine protected areas in the Philippines","Regional Studies in Marine Science","Abstract Establishment of marine protected areas (MPA) is among the most commonly implemented initiatives for coral reef conservation and fisheries management in the Philippines. However, there are concerns that the MPAs in the country may not work because of their generally small sizes and high fishing pressures from the burgeoning highly resource-dependent population. In this study, we assessed the assemblages of seven commercially important coral reef fish families (Acanthuridae (excluding genus Zebrasoma), Labridae (subfamily Scarinae only), Lutjanidae, Serranidae (subfamily Epinephelinae only), Mullidae, Haemulidae and Lethrinidae) inside and outside MPAs in 37 coastal municipalities in the Philippines. A total of 12,354 individuals belonging to 114 species (33 species of Acanthuridae, 27 species of Scarinae, 17 species of Lutjanidae, 16 species of Epinephelinae, 9 species of Mullidae, 6 species of Haemulidae, and 6 species of Lethrinidae) were recorded. Overall, reef fishes inside MPAs were more diverse than outside MPAs based on Shannon-Wiener index of diversity. Reefs inside MPAs had an average of four more fish species than outside MPAs. Both inside and outside MPAs had comparable equitability values which are characterized by fish communities that are largely dominated by few species only. Higher fish densities, especially fishes with =25cm (total length), were also recorded inside MPAs. However, we also found some patterns suggesting that more efforts must be made in order to effectively protect many of the commercially important coral reef fishes from the impacts of fishing. Our study provides valuable science-based insights that can be used to improve coral reef conservation and fisheries management initiatives in the country. Moreover, it can also serve as crucial information that can be used for monitoring and evaluation of MPA effectiveness, particularly on commercially important coral reef fishes in the country.","10.1016/j.rsma.2015.03.004","CE","CE_8282",279,0.294898326278331,0.247305166490916,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

We examined whether connectivity improved reserve performance by investigating how isolation between coral reefs and mangroves influenced fish assemblages inside and outside a reserve in Moreton Bay, Australia. Connectivity greatly enhanced reserve performance, with close reserve habitats supporting more harvested fish, and a greater abundance of both piscivores and herbivores than similar nonreserve locations. Close reserve habitats also contained fewer prey fish than nonreserve locations. In contrast, fish abundance in isolated reserve habitats did not differ from similar nonreserve locations.

For this reason, focal species and habitats are used as surrogates for multispecies conservation, but species-based approaches are not widely adopted in marine ecosystems. Reserves in the Solomon Islands were designed on the basis of local ecological knowledge to conserve bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum) and to protect food security and ecosystem functioning. Bumphead parrotfish are an iconic threatened species and may be a useful surrogate for multispecies conservation. They move across tropical seascapes throughout their life history, in a pattern of habitat use that is shared with many other species. We examined their value as a conservation surrogate and assessed the importance of seascape connectivity (i.e., the physical connectedness of patches in the seascape) among reefs, mangroves, and seagrass to marine reserve performance. Reserves were designed for bumphead parrotfish, but also enhanced the abundance of other species. Integration of local ecological knowledge and seascape connectivity enhanced the abundance of 17 other harvested fish species in local reserves. This result has important implications for ecosystem functioning and local villagers because many of these species perform important ecological processes and provide the foundation for extensive subsistence fisheries.

Mobile organisms link important processes across ecosystems, however, their roles in providing these services are often overlooked and we need to know how they influence ecosystem functions in reserves. Herbivorous fish play a key role in coral reef seascapes. By removing algae, they promote coral growth and recruitment, and help to increase resilience. We examined how connectivity with mangroves affected herbivore populations and benthic succession on reefs in eastern Australia. We surveyed fish assemblages, examined reef composition and characterised benthic recruitment on reefs at multiple levels of connectivity with mangroves, in a no-take reserve and areas open to fishing. Our results show that connectivity enhanced herbivore biomass and richness in reserves, and that these connectivity and reserve effects interacted to promote herbivory on protected reefs near mangroves. Connectivity and reserve protection combined to double the biomass of roving herbivorous fish on protected reefs near mangroves. The increase in grazing intensity drove a trophic cascade that reduced algal cover and enhanced coral recruitment and reef resilience. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that ecosystem resilience can be improved by managing both reefs and adjacent habitats together as functional seascape units. By understanding how landscapes influence resilience, and explicitly incorporating these effects into conservation decision-making, we may have greater success with environmental restoration and preservation actions.

Results showed significant inside/outside differences in the multivariate abundance of fish assemblage. These results were confirmed and exemplified by significant univariate differences between locations for total abundance, Species Richness and diversity of the fish assemblage; values of these metrics were higher inside the reserve than outside. Small fish size and species of low and medium fishing value did not display significant inside/outside differences in abundances whereas medium, large size fish and high value species showed abundances significantly higher inside the marine reserve.

Protected-area design should be based on detailed movements of target animals; however, such data are lacking for most species. To address this, 25 sharks from three species were tagged with acoustic transmitters and monitored with a network of 103 receivers to determine the use of a protected area at Mangrove Bay, Western Australia. Movements of a subset of 12 individuals (Carcharhinus melanopterus [n=7]), C. amblyrhynchos [n=2], and Negaprion acutidens [n=3]) were analysed over two years. Residency for all species ranged between 12 and 96%. Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos had <1% of position estimates within the MPA, compared to C. melanopterus adults that ranged between 0 and 99%. Juvenile sharks had high percentages of position estimates in the MPA (84-99%). Kernel density activity centres for C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos were largely outside the MPA and mean activity space estimates for adults were 12.8 km2 (±3.12 SE) and 19.6 km2 (±2.26), respectively. Juveniles had smaller activity spaces: C. melanopterus, 7.2 ±1.33 km2; N. acutidens, 0.6 km2 (±0.04). Both C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos had peaks in detections during daylight hours (1200 and 0900 h, respectively), whereas N. acutidens had a peak in detections at 0200 h. Long-distance movements were observed for adult C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos, the longest being approximately 275 km. These migrations of C. melanopterus might be related to reproductive behaviours, because they were all observed in adult females during the summer months and provide links between known in-shore aggregation and possible nursery areas. The MPA at Mangrove Bay provided some protection for juvenile and adult reef sharks, although protection is likely greater for juveniles due to their more restricted movements.","10.1016/j.rsma.2015.05.002","CE","CE_8290",268,0.158553023750604,0.036672775162495,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8292,2012,"Interactive effects of depth and marine protection on predation and herbivory patterns","Marine Ecology Progress Series","The establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) worldwide has shown that closure of areas to fishing results in major changes in the structure of marine ecosystems. The removal of high-order consumers by fishing has both direct and indirect effects that can lead to important changes in the strength of trophic interactions. Although the effects of marine protection on biological interactions are beginning to be understood, our knowledge is largely restricted to shallow-water assemblages. However, depth gradients are also characterised by significant differences in the intensity of trophic linkages, and these may be interacting with any effects derived from protection. In this study, the individual and combined effects of depth and marine reserve protection on predation and herbivory were determined across 3 regions in the NW Mediterranean (Catalunya, Mallorca and Menorca) using juvenile urchins and palatable algae as bioassays. Marine protection did not strongly influence fish herbivory, which generally decreased with depth. We found no evidence of depth-related changes in predation rates or the size of predatory fishes, but there was a strong effect of protection on predation rates that was only consistently observed across regions in shallow water (5 m depth), but not at greater depths (15 and 30 m). This increase in predation of sea urchins within MPAs in shallow waters can have important community-wide consequences, as herbivorous sea urchins are commonly most abundant in these shallow habitats and predator-urchin interactions have important cascading effects on algal communities. © Inter-Research 2012.",NA,"CE","CE_8292",242,0.249723875075434,0.0654172732541665,"250","neutral","neutral_250",1
8294,2017,"Detecting fisheries trends in a co-managed area in the Kingdom of Tonga","Fisheries Research","Community based and co-management approaches are increasingly used strategies for marine conservation and sustainable management in the tropical Pacific. However, our understanding of the effectiveness of co-management on marine resources and socio economic conditions is relatively limited, often due to insufficient resources to support monitoring based on ecological condition or catch landings data. Monitoring programmes based on the perceptions of resource users are often presented as a cost effective alternative to understanding the status and changes in resource and socio economic conditions. Ecological, catch landings and perception-based data, and their collection methods, have different benefits and limitations for community-based programmes. Here we present a study of the first community-based, co-managed area in the Kingdom of Tonga - the small island of O'ua. We examine both perception-based data from interviews and catch landings data to describe fishing activities, catches and changes in resource status and socio economic conditions since the inception of co-management. Landings data were collected by the community over a five year period; perceptions of change and management performance were collected through structured interviews with fishers based on the same time period. The majority of fishing within the O'ua co-managed area was by men, using hand spears in fibreglass vessels <5 m in length powered by an outboard engine. We found that catch per unit effort was high (especially the estimates generated from perception data) compared to other parts of the Pacific. Since the inception of co-management fishers reported improved socio economic conditions, a greater sense of stewardship over resources, active involvement in management and the effective exclusion of outside fishers. We compared catch and catch-per-unit-effort estimates generated from landings and perception data. While fishers perceived that catches had improved since the inception of co-management, landings data suggested that catches were either stable or declining. These differences are important as they would suggest very different management responses. We discuss the trade-offs between the catch landings and perception data in terms of accuracy, precision, participation and cost for the purpose of guiding adjustments to co-management.","10.1016/j.fishres.2016.08.026","CE","CE_8294",349,0.255001990130026,0.239382455279619,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

We examined data collected by a small group of divers over the past 21 years at one of the world's oldest marine protected areas (MPAs), Cocos Island National Park, Costa Rica. We used mixed effects models to determine trends in relative abundance, or probability of occurrence, of 12 monitored elasmobranch species while accounting for variation among observers and from abiotic factors. Eight of 12 species declined significantly over the past 2 decades. We documented decreases in relative abundance for 6 species, including the iconic scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) (-45%), whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus) (-77%), mobula ray (Mobula spp.) (-78%), and manta ray (Manta birostris) (-89%), and decreases in the probability of occurrence for 2 other species. Several of these species have small home ranges and should be better protected by an MPA, which underscores the notion that declines of marine megafauna will continue unabated in MPAs unless there is adequate enforcement effort to control fishing. In addition, probability of occurrence at Cocos Island of tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), and whale (Rhincodon typus) sharks increased significantly.

We evaluated the effects of a large-scale offshore MPA located on the Southwest Atlantic Patagonian Shelf (43°S 63°W) on the demersal fish assemblage. Compliance of the Patagonian MPA was assessed by analysing eight years of satellite vessel monitoring system (VMS; 2000-2008) data, which showed compliance and fishing effort concentrated near the protection boundaries. MPA effects were studied by employing a five year database collected by a scientific research vessel in protected and fishing locations, before and after the MPA establishment.

Here the effect of full protection within a Mediterranean marine protected area on ß-diversity patterns of fish assemblages along a depth gradient comparing a no-take zone with multiple unprotected areas is explored. The no-take zone showed significantly higher synecological parameters, higher ß-diversity among depths, and lower small-scale heterogeneity of fish assemblages relative to unprotected areas. Such patterns might likely depend on the high level of fishing pressure outside the no-take zone, as also abundance-biomass curves seemed to indicate. Results suggested that full protection could play a role in maintaining high ß-diversity, thus reducing the fragility of marine communities and ecosystems, and spatial heterogeneity may represent a reliable predictor of how management actions could provide insurance against undesirable phase shifts.","10.1002/aqc.2750","CE","CE_8300",157,0.283325904353794,0.230131699101512,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

This study examined artisanal fisheries of Karimunjawa National Park, Java, to understand how the condition of an artisanal fishery was related to socio-cultural factors, along a gradient in fishing pressure. A total of 8674 fishes landed in Karimunjawa by fishers using four artisanal fishing gears were examined to understand how the condition of the artisanal fishery (standard and infinite fish length, trophic level and weight) related to fishing gear use, village fishing grounds, management, human population size, human population density and estimated fishing pressure. Depletion in fish lengths and trophic structure were found at or above 46 fishing trips day-1km-2, suggesting that fishing pressure is a key factor driving fishery catch structure. When catch characteristics were examined in relation to the fishing pressure estimates from each village, negative correlations were found between inshore fishing pressure (no. trips day-1km-2) and all four fish catch characteristics, but owing to small sample sizes (n=5), only the effects on trophic level were significant. Fishery closures had limited impact on fish characteristics, and lack of any effect of spatial controls on fishing also supports the notion that fishing pressure and the types of fishing gears used, most likely driven by human population densities, are the greatest drivers of reef fish catch characteristics in the Karimunjawa fishery. In the absence of support for fishery closures from local fishing communities or adequate enforcement of fishery closures, targeted gear or species management strategies that limit impacts on large-bodied fish and aim to conserve key species may be more effective in improving the size and trophic structure of fish populations. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","10.1002/aqc.2359","CE","CE_8301",305,0.20308347867017,0.113352816163076,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Eleven years of no-take policy appears to maintain Plectropomus spp. biomass up to 5 km from the reserve center. Hard coral cover influenced reef fish abundance and biomass but it did not affect the presence of Plectropomus spp. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of a no-take marine reserve not only requires consideration of ecological connectivity, reserve size and location, but also socio-economic factors including compliance, enforcement availability and community participation to achieve greater benefits.","10.1016/j.rsma.2016.12.010","CE","CE_8304",195,0.252086072110371,0.264125186385074,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Protection measures positively affected predatory fish assemblages, enhancing the intensity of predatory interactions in comparison to equivalent unprotected areas (UAs), and causing indirect effects on populations of the key herbivorous sea urchin Diadema aff. antillarum. Results of tethering experiments and the strong negative correlation found between predation rate and prey density strongly suggest that predation controls sea urchin populations. Overall urchin density was lower in MPAs than in UAs; however, species composition of predatory fish assemblages and the size of sea urchin effectively preyed upon differed significantly between studied islands, as did urchin size-frequency distributions. Only in locations where key predatory species (balistids, diodontids and large labrid species) were present was there the potential to promote top-down control on sea urchins. The present study shows the importance of both protection measures and environmental context to enhance the strength of predatory fish activity. Protection under different contexts can produce different consequences of predation interactions, even over relatively small spatial scales. Therefore, regional and local-scale environmental gradients should not be overlooked as a factor affecting the occurrence and magnitude of predatory interactions in benthic marine communities, especially in systems that are markedly variable at small scales. © Inter-Research 2011.",NA,"CE","CE_8305",226,0.262915395583151,0.0411257356546462,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

A new meta-analysis of previous studies shows that biomass of whole fish assemblages in marine reserves is, on average, 670% greater than in adjacent unprotected areas, and 343% greater than in partially-protected MPAs. Marine reserves also help restore the complexity of ecosystems through a chain of ecological effects (trophic cascades) once the abundance of large animals recovers sufficiently. Marine reserves may not be immune to the effects of climate change, but to date, reserves with complex ecosystems are more resilient than unprotected areas.

We assessed the capacity of a large MPA to conserve grey reef sharks - a Near Threatened species with a widespread distribution and poorly understood offshore movement patterns - using a combination of conventional tags, satellite tags, and an emerging vessel tracking technology. We found that the 54,000 km2 U.S. Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the central Pacific Ocean provides substantial protection for grey reef sharks, as two-thirds of satellite-tracked sharks remained within MPA boundaries for the entire study duration. Additionally, our analysis of > 0.5 million satellite detections of commercial fishing vessels identified virtually no fishing effort within the refuge and significant effort beyond the MPA perimeter, suggesting that large MPAs can effectively benefit reef sharks and other mobile species if properly enforced. However, our results also highlight limitations of place-based conservation as some of these reef-associated sharks moved surprising distances into pelagic waters (up to 926 km from Palmyra Atoll, 810 km beyond MPA boundaries). Small-scale fishermen operating beyond MPA boundaries (up to 366 km from Palmyra) captured 2% of sharks that were initially tagged at Palmyra, indicating that large MPAs provide substantial, though incomplete, protection for reef sharks.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.01.009","CE","CE_8307",248,0.170795294867123,0.145152876448121,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The independent effects of these drivers are well documented, but the relative importance and interaction between fishing and habitat shifts is poorly understood, particularly in complex systems such as coral reefs. To assess the combined and relative effects of fishing and habitat we examined the composition of fish communities on patch reefs across a gradient of high to low structural complexity in fished and unfished areas of the Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia. Biomass and species richness of fish were positively correlated with structural complexity of reefs and negatively related to macroalgal cover. Total abundance of fish was also positively related to structural complexity, however this relationship was stronger on fished reefs than those where fishing is prohibited. The interaction between habitat condition and fishing pressure is primarily due to the high abundance of small bodied planktivorous fish on fished reefs. However, the influence of management zones on the abundance and biomass of predators and target species is small, implying spatial differences in fishing pressure are low and unlikely to be driving this interaction. Our results emphasise the importance of habitat in structuring reef fish communities on coral reefs especially when gradients in fishing pressure are low. The influence of fishing effort on this relationship may however become more important as fishing pressure increases. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.marenvres.2012.08.002","CE","CE_8308",231,0.168590840405486,0.225240831675232,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

To do so, we applied novel multi-event models to a 9-year data set containing both live recaptures and dead recoveries of marked fish of different sizes collected before and after the implementation of an MPA, also including several unprotected sites. At the MPA site, the annual proportion of deaths due to fishing decreased from 0·59 before MPA implementation to 0·32 after MPA implementation. As a result, annual survival increased by 167% (from 0·09 to 0·24) for small (16-44 cm) and 83% (from 0·23 to 0·42) for big (45-97 cm) cod, respectively. Average survival was lower in unprotected areas, and annual fishing mortality was higher, representing almost 100% of the total mortality of large-sized cod in some years. Annual emigration rates (i.e. spillover from the MPA) increased in the last years of the study, but no differences in body growth were detected between sites. Closure of the fishery within the MPA would further increase the annual survival of smaller individuals by 100% (from 0·24 ± 0·07 to 0·48 ± 0·11) and that of larger individuals by 44% (from 0·42 ± 0·05 to 0·60 ± 0·09). Synthesis and applications. Our study reveals how current marine protected areas (MPAs) function and provides important insights for guiding a future adaptive management process. Given that harvested populations will not be able to sustain annual survival rates consistently below 30%, as found here; our results underscore the urgency of effective management measures such as no-take zones in areas where local populations are particularly reduced or in dire need of demographic rescue.

8317,2012,"Evaluating marine protected areas for the conservation of tropical coastal sharks","Biological Conservation","Global declines in shark populations have created uncertainty in the future status of many species and conservation efforts are urgently needed. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are used increasingly as conservation tools around the world, but how they benefit mobile and wide ranging species like sharks remains unclear. To evaluate the degree of protection MPAs may provide for sharks, we used an array of acoustic receivers to examine the movements and spatial use of two tropical coastal species within two MPAs in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. Juvenile pigeye (. Carcharhinus amboinensis) and adult spottail (. Carcharhinus sorrah) sharks were fitted with acoustic transmitters from 2009 to 2010. Both species displayed long-term use of MPAs, with some individuals detected for longer than 600. days. The mean percentage of time . C. . amboinensis and . C. . sorrah spent inside MPAs was 22% and 32%, respectively. MPA use varied seasonally, with . C. . amboinensis spending a higher percentage of time inside MPAs in summer (mean. =. 28%) and . C. . sorrah spending a higher percentage of time inside MPAs in winter (mean. =. 40%). Although sharks used large areas inside MPAs, most individuals tended to use only half of the available protected space. In addition, all sharks made excursions from MPAs and individuals exited and re-entered at consistent locations along the MPA boundaries. These results demonstrate that MPAs have conservation benefits for shark populations by providing protection across different species and life stages, and tracking studies can be used to help tailor MPA design to maximize effectiveness. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2012.01.008","CE","CE_8317",245,0.161919051116069,0.115388590627954,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8320,2011,"Fishing gear modifications to reduce elasmobranch mortality in pelagic and bottom longline fisheries off Northeast Brazil","Fisheries Research","One of the biggest challenges of fisheries research is reducing the bycatch of unwanted species. The incidental fishing mortality of species with low reproductive rates, such as elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays), is recognized as a key threat for their populations. In the present study, gear modifications related to the type of hook and position of the hook in the water column were tested to examine their effects on catch rates and mortality of elasmobranch species in both pelagic and coastal environments. Comparisons between circle (size 18/0, 0° offset) and J-style (size 9/0, 10° offset) hooks demonstrated that the circle hooks have a greater efficiency in reducing the mortality of most species caught, both in pelagic and coastal longline fisheries. Internal lodging of the hook was significantly less frequent for the individuals caught with circle hooks, which likely contributed to their higher survival rate at haulback. Additionally, circle hooks also increased the CPUE of elasmobranchs caught in the pelagic longline fishery, which was particularly evident for Carcharhinus falciformis and Prionace glauca. The position of the hook in the water column exhibited a strong influence on the species caught in the coastal bottom longline fishery. Suspending hooks in the middle of the water column reduced the bycatch of common demersal species, such as Carcharhinus acronotus, Ginglymostoma cirratum, and Dasyatis americana, while increasing the CPUE of potentially aggressive species, such as Galeocerdo cuvier and Carcharhinus leucas. The interaction of the type of hook utilized with its position in the water column appears to be an essential factor in the optimization of longline selectivity and minimization of bycatch mortality. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2011.01.007","CE","CE_8320",266,0.171554708160472,0.02306600523862,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8321,2016,"Selective commercial line fishing and biodiversity conservation co-exist on seamounts in a deepwater marine reserve","Fisheries Research","Enhanced socio-economic and conservation outcomes for both an existing fishery and a new deep-water marine reserve off eastern Australia were achieved by research that identified additional options for conservation managers. Commercial power hand-line fishing was permitted to continue on productive seamount fishing grounds within the reserve because new information enabled boundaries and zoning proposed in the reserve's draft Management Plan to be revised and consistent fisheries regulations to be formulated. The draft plan would have removed access to fishing grounds that provide approximately 25% of the annual regional Australian total allowable catch of the premium fishery species, Blue-eye Trevalla (Hyperoglyphe antarctica). Day-time power handline fishing in 280550 m depths on Taupo and Barcoo Seamounts avoided Harrisson's Dogfish (Centrophorus harrissoni)  the primary species of conservation concern  because the shark is a diel vertical migrator, residing deeper than Blue-eye during the day before ascending to shallower depths at night to feed on micronekton. Harrisson's Dogfish occurs on several other seamounts where it was previously unrecorded. These results, together with expectation of low mortality of any incidental dogfish bycatch and low impacts on benthic habitats, supported changes to management arrangements which preserve the seamount Blue-eye fishery worth approximately A$1M annually whilst protecting more seamounts and greater areas of benthic habitat in the restricted 200700 m depth range. Research uptake was facilitated by clarifying policy options at a critical stage in the planning process. This required having clearly articulated management objectives that aligned conservation and fishery imperatives, involving knowledgeable fishers in making robust field observations to address specific knowledge gaps and management needs, and identifying the requirements for ongoing fishery monitoring that addresses remaining management uncertainties. This potential to identify win-win outcomes in the Australian marine planning process provides some general signposts for future policy decisions as marine reserve networks are implemented and reviewed, and for scientists wanting to effectively engage in decision-making processes.","10.1016/j.fishres.2016.02.015","CE","CE_8321",317,0.371573240583153,0.363356466072383,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

The trawls were tested in an Australian estuarine fishery during paired deployments (n=. 44) across replicate nights and during days with variable cloud cover (categorized as 50%). Catches were dominated by the targeted school prawns, Metapenaeus macleayi and seven teleosts. Only two teleosts (southern herring, Herklotsichthys castelnaui and Australian anchovy, Engraulis australis) along with the school prawns were significantly affected by trawl side taper, with all retained in lower numbers by the short trawl. For school prawns and Australian anchovy, their catch reductions mostly remained consistent irrespective of diel phase and diurnal cloud cover, but southern herring (mostly smaller individuals) only escaped from the short trawl during diurnal deployments and with <50% cloud; possibly through anterior meshes in response to more available ambient light. The results highlight the importance of environmental parameters for affecting the selectivity of penaeid trawls, and have implications for their ongoing refinement and use as survey tools.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.05.027","CE","CE_8322",196,0.159188728549789,0.119194069171289,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Uncorrected for any potential impacts from predation, tagging, research-related handling, or holding conditions overall survival for plaice (n=349), sole (n=226), and dab (n=187) was assessed as 15% [95% CI: 11-19%], 29% [95% CI: 24-35%], and 16% [95% CI: 10-26%] respectively. Survival was mainly effected by water temperature and factors linked to the fishing vessel. Fish length was not found to affect survival. Catch processing time and haul duration affected plaice survival but not sole.

Identifying how different components of capture influence the condition of discarded fish can help develop specific guidelines and best handling practices. Using an experimental approach, we modified the severity of capture stressors in commercial purse seine fisheries for Pacific salmon and monitored indices of injury and reflex impairment in chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), a species commonly discarded from these fisheries. Study fish were held for 5 or 10 days. Modeling of changes in injury and impairment sought to disentangle the latent effects of capture stressors and the role of sex and maturity. Thresholds in physiological responses to times (i) pursed in the net and (ii) air exposed on deck were also evaluated. Injury progressed throughout holding, was more extensive in females, and accelerated faster in less mature fish. Both crowding severity and set size (i.e. estimated number of fish caught) increased injury and impairment, effects that were exacerbated with time pursed. Physiological indicators of exhaustion also increased with time pursed and 15 min was identified as an important transition point, potentially representing the temporal limit to anaerobic exercise. The time between 1 and 3 min of air exposure was identified as being important to survival, and after 6 min of air exposure, endogenous energy stores may have become exhausted. Resulting recommendations include keeping nets loose during sorting, releasing fish prior to 15 min of being pursed, and keeping air exposure within the range of 12 min, or less. Additionally, females and less mature fish appear to be more susceptible to the injurious effects of capture.","10.1016/j.fishres.2018.04.021","CE","CE_8328",268,0.287316996085955,-0.0779705803448233,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8329,2018,"Swim for it: effects of simulated fisheries capture on the post-release behaviour of four Great Barrier Reef fishes","Fisheries Research","After being caught and released by a fishery, some animals may be sufficiently impaired so as to be vulnerable to predators. The duration and severity of post-release impairments have rarely been studied under natural conditions; the vitality of animals is usually assessed aboard a vessel, prior to release, while examinations of post-release behaviour are usually restricted to what is within view of a vessel. In this study, we quantified the post-release behavior of the common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus), two species of emperor (Lethrinus spp.), and the Spanish flag snapper (Lutjanus carponotatus), each of which is actively fished throughout the Great Barrier Reef. SCUBA divers followed fish in the field and recorded their behavior with underwater video cameras after a simulated catch-and-release event. Relative to a low stress treatment (held in an aerated tank prior to release), fish exposed to forced exercise and 5 min of air exposure spent more time in vulnerable positions after release, including 5.8× more time immobile under the boat upon release, 1.6× more time to reach the reef floor, and 2.4× longer to reach the protection of the reef. The effects of the catch-and-release simulation on tailbeat frequency, ventilation rate, and the proportion of overall time spent immobile were not significant except in L. carponotatus, which spent significantly more time immobile when exposed to the high stress treatment. Indeed, there were some notable differences among species, with the magnitude of the behavioural impairments being lower and less variable in coral trout than in Lethrinus spp. or L. carponotatus. These findings provide support for the notion that minimizing air exposure time in hook-and-line fisheries should reduce post-release behavioural impairments and thus vulnerability to predators.","10.1016/j.fishres.2018.05.012","CE","CE_8329",284,0.317964270236826,-0.122122056591264,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8330,2013,"Short-term post-release mortality of skates (family Rajidae) discarded in a western North Atlantic commercial otter trawl fishery","Fisheries Research","Due to market and regulatory factors, Rajidae skates are routinely discarded by commercial otter trawlers in the western North Atlantic. Accounting for post-release mortality is therefore essential to total fishing mortality estimates, stock status and management of this group of fishes. However, despite a presumed species-specific range in tolerance, few studies have investigated the short-term post-release mortality among skates indigenous to the western North Atlantic following capture by mobile fishing gears, and never in the Gulf of Maine. This study addresses this shortfall for the prohibited thorny skate, Amblyraja radiate and smooth skate, Malacoraja senta, and the targeted winter skate, Leucoraja ocellata, and little skate, Leucoraja erinacea. Of 1288 skates evaluated, negligible immediate mortality was observed at the time of capture, even in relation to the largest catches and/or most prolonged tows. However, injury frequency was moderate, with highest levels in the smooth (60%) and thorny (52%) skates. Aside from the smooth skate (59%), 72. h mortality rates were low overall (19% across all species when accounting tow durations indicative of the fishery), with the winter skate (8%) exhibiting the lowest levels. Logistic regression modeling revealed tow duration as the most universal predictor of condition and 72. h mortality, while catch biomass, sex, temperature changes, and animal size also held influence in certain species. Although in general the studied species appear more resilient to trawl capture and handling than previously estimated, interspecific differences must be accounted for when managing this group. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2012.09.020","CE","CE_8330",241,0.161837805207667,-0.0502014090720546,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8331,2014,"Short-term survival of discarded pearl perch (<i>Glaucosoma scapulare</i> Ramsay, 1881) caught by hook-and-line in Queensland, Australia","Fisheries Research","Post-release survival of line-caught pearl perch (Glaucosoma scapulare) was assessed via field experiments where fish were angled using methods similar to those used by commercial, recreational and charter fishers. One hundred and eighty-three individuals were caught during four experiments, of which >91% survived up to three days post-capture. Hook location was found to be the best predictor of survival, with the survival of throat- or stomach-hooked pearl perch significantly (P< 0.05) lower than those hooked in either the mouth or lip. Post-release survival was similar for both legal (=35. cm) and sub-legal (<35. cm) pearl perch, while those individuals showing no signs of barotrauma were more likely to survive in the short term. Examination of the swim bladders in the laboratory, combined with observations in the field, revealed that swim bladders rupture during ascent from depth allowing swim bladder gases to escape into the gut cavity. As angled fish approach the surface, the alimentary tract ruptures near the anus allowing swim bladder gases to escape the gut cavity. As a result, very few pearl perch exhibit barotrauma symptoms and no barotrauma mitigation strategies were recommended. The results of this study show that pearl perch are relatively resilient to catch-and-release suggesting that post-release mortality would not contribute significantly to total fishing mortality. We recommend the use of circle hooks, fished actively on tight lines, combined with minimal handling in order to maximise the post-release survival of pearl perch. © 2013.","10.1016/j.fishres.2013.12.005","CE","CE_8331",244,0.171578066570696,0.0880935078180356,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Consequently, it is mandatory to release both northern and spotted wolffish and it has been recommended that live-release protocols also apply to Atlantic wolffish. Catches in trawls comprise a significant threat to recovery of all three wolffish species and the Grand Bank yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) otter trawl fishery overlaps the most persistent high concentrations of Atlantic wolffish in the western North Atlantic. As a result, the trawl fishery initiated a voluntary live-release program. The current study investigated the post-capture survival of Atlantic wolffish captured incidentally in the Grand Bank yellowtail flounder otter trawl fishery. Short-term survival was monitored for wolffish placed in holding tanks onboard commercial vessels as well as wolffish returned to the ocean floor in cages. High (92-100%) post-capture survival was demonstrated in Atlantic wolffish following net entrainment in commercial tows up to 2.5. h, haul back through a thermocline (range, 5.8. °C), and exposure to 5-13. °C air temperatures for up to 2. h. High post-capture survival and similarities among all three species of wolffish with regard to morphology, physiology, post-capture activity levels, and tag returns in previous studies suggest live-release programs will help to rebuild populations of all three wolffish species. From a conservation perspective, release of wolffish can only be effective if it does not interfere with reproduction.

Survival was measured using specialized sea cages for holding individual fish. The external physical signs associated with extreme expansion and retention of swimbladder gas (pronounced barotrauma), including esophageal eversion, exophthalmia and ocular emphysema, were common for both species at these capture depths and were more frequent than in prior studies conducted at shallower depths. Despite similar frequencies of most external barotrauma signs, 48-h post-recompression survival of the two species diverged markedly as capture depth increased. Survival of yelloweye rockfish was above 80% across all capture depths, while survival of canary rockfish was lower, declining sharply to just 25% at capture depths greater than 135. m. Fish of both species that were alive after 48. h of caging displayed very few of the external signs of pronounced barotrauma and had a high submergence success rate when released at the surface. Logistic regression analysis, using a combined data set from this and an earlier experiment conducted at shallower capture depths, was used to more broadly evaluate factors influencing post-recompression survival.

Between 2005 and 2014, rays were recorded in 8.2% of observed purse seine sets. Rays were caught during summer, with a hotspot (24.3% of sets) near the shelf edge off North Island over seabed depths of 150350 m. Rays were usually brailed aboard with the tuna catch from successful sets, but were often entangled in the bunt of the net during unsuccessful sets. Observers tagged nine rays with popup archival tags to obtain preliminary information on their post-release survival, and spatial and vertical movements. Seven of the nine tags reported data, and four of those rays died within 24 days of release. All four rays that died had been brought aboard entangled in the bunt. The three surviving rays were all brailed aboard with the tuna catch. One surviving ray remained near New Zealand for 2.7 months during summer, and the other two migrated 14001800 km northward to tropical waters near Vanuatu and Fiji at minimum speeds of 47 and 63 km day-1 at the end of summer. Archive data from one ray showed that it made regular vertical movements of 25100 m amplitude, but spent most of its time shallower than 50 m, more so during the night (89.6%) than the day (76.6%), and mainly experienced temperatures of 18-22 °C. Dives deeper than 200 m were usually made during the day or twilight. All three surviving rays typically moved between the surface and 200300 m daily, and reached greatest depths of 649 m, 1000 m and 1112 m, respectively, substantially exceeding the previous depth record for this species of 445 m. Recommendations are made for reducing purse seine mortality of mobulid rays by avoiding areas of high ray abundance, avoiding setting on ray-associated tuna schools, and adopting best-practice methods of returning rays to the sea from the net or vessel.

Whale shark, the world's largest fish, is believed to be particularly vulnerable owing to its biological characteristics (slow growth, late maturation, great longevity) and is listed as Vulnerable by IUCN and included in Appendix II of CITES. 2. Whale sharks are occasionally encircled in tropical tuna purse-seine nets, throughout this global fishery. Although apparent immediate survival rates following encirclement and release have recently been assessed through scientific onboard observer programmes, a more rigorous methodology is still required for studying post-released survival. 3. This work provides a method for applying pop-up satellite tags and reports an enhanced release procedure for whale sharks. The first assessment of survival after release from purse-seine nets involved six whale sharks tagged between May and September 2014 in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. Five tags transmitted data: three popped up as programmed (after 30 days), while two surfaced prematurely (one after 21 and the other after 71 days (programmed to pop off after 30 and 90 days, respectively)) but showed no sign of unusual behaviour. 4. Overall, whale sharks survived at least 21 days (one at least 71 days) after release from purse-seine nets. These observations based on five large individuals (total length > 8 m), suggest that whale sharks have a good chance of survival when released with the proposed method. 5. Additional tagging in this and other oceans, especially of juveniles which may be more sensitive to encirclement and release operations, is essential to further assess whale shark post-release survival rates in tuna purse-seine fisheries.

How the addition of artificial light is causing these changes in fish behavior and bycatch reduction is not known. However, in both experiments the addition of artificial light appears to have greatly increased the passage of fishes through restricted spaces (between BRD bars and the open space between trawl fishing line and groundline) that they typically would not pass through as readily under normal seafloor ambient light conditions.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.05.010","CE","CE_8337",304,0.230330948806489,-0.161828114531431,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
8338,2018,"Could green artificial light reduce bycatch during Barents Sea Deep-water shrimp trawling?","Fisheries Research","The Nordmøre grid is widely used in shrimp trawls to reduce the bycatch of fish species. However, small-sized fish species and juveniles still pass through the grid and enter the codend, along with the targeted shrimp. This bycatch of small fish has a negative impact on the ecosystem due to increased fish mortality, and leads to additional sorting work onboard. Some small-sized fish that enter the trawl avoid entering the codend by escaping through the outlet above the grid, without making contact with the grid itself. Design changes that promote this behavior could potentially reduce bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) mounted around the escape outlet have previously been found to have either a negative effect, or no effect at all, on fish bycatch species. This study investigates the effect of mounting green LEDs on the lower part of a Nordmøre grid, to determine if their presence would encourage bycatch fish to rise towards the escape outlet prior to contacting the grid. Experimental fishing trials were conducted to assess the size selective properties of a 19 mm bar spaced Nordmøre grid with and without LEDs, mounted on a bottom trawl targeting Deep-water shrimp (Pandalus borealis). For the four bycatch species investigated, 51100% of small fish passed through the Nordmøre grid. The addition of green LEDs to the Nordmøre grid did not significantly affect the escape probability or the size selectivity of any of the investigated species. Very few Deep-water shrimp were found to escape through the escape outlet independent of the presence of the LEDs mounted on the grid.","10.1016/j.fishres.2018.03.023","CE","CE_8338",264,0.0936758054630825,0.0514344423214907,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

In the Northwest Atlantic, blue sharks (Prionace glauca) account for most of the bycatch in the Canadian pelagic longline swordfish fishery. Minimizing the capture of this species is of interest to conservationists as well as the fishing industry because the high incidence of shark bycatch negatively affects fishing operations through bait loss and increased handling time. Electropositive metals (e.g., lanthanide) oxidize in seawater and create electric fields, which can alter the swimming and feeding behaviors of several species of sharks. Although electropositive metals appear to have the potential to reduce shark bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries, there have not been any controlled trials reported from a commercial fishery. A total of 7 sets (6300 hooks) with 3 hook treatments (standard hooks, hooks with electropositive metals (neodymium/praseodymium), and hooks with lead weights) were deployed in 2011 on the Scotian Shelf in the Northwest Atlantic. The results of this study show that electropositive metals did not reduce the catch of blue sharks or other common shark bycatch species, and hence do not present a practical bycatch mitigation measure for the Canadian longline fishery. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2013.01.020","CE","CE_8342",200,0.204450883333462,-0.149870058923879,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Recently, the naturally electrogenic lanthanide metals have been introduced as an elasmobranch-specific repellent. We quantified the voltage produced by six lanthanide metals in seawater, compared their dissolution rates, and performed a behavioral assay to determine their efficacy against two coastal shark species. We found that there was no difference in the voltage produced by the six tested metals and the voltage decayed as a power function (approximately x-1.5) with distance from the metal sample. We calculated that sharks should detect a sample of neodymium from a distance of 65-85cm in seawater. Voltage was greatest in freshwater and decreased logarithmically with increasing salinity but did not differ above salinities greater than 10ppt. The dissolution rate for the lanthanides varied from -1.6 to -0.2gh-1 and as the metals dissolved, the voltage remained constant.

Although not a major contributor to S. mokarran mortality, beach nets are utilized in several locations to minimize the potential harmful interaction between sharks and beachgoers. To address this mortality, permanent magnets have been employed to determine if these materials can deter sharks away from netted areas. The present study examined the effects of barium-ferrite (BaFe12O19) permanent magnets on S. mokarran behavior under several environmental and biological conditions. In the bait experiment, feeding frequency significantly decreased and avoidance frequency significantly increased with the magnet treatment, with exposure quantity yielding an increase in feeding frequency, although this effect was not statistically significant. For the barrier experiment, entrance frequency significantly decreased and avoidance and pass-around frequencies significantly increased with the magnet treatment, with heterospecific density also being a significant pre - dictor of entrance frequency. The findings demonstrate how permanent magnets can modify S. mokarran behavior and how this behavior is modified based on situational context. Since several other sphyrnid species are caught in beach nets more frequently than S. mokarran (e.g. scalloped hammerheads S. lewini), the present results may serve as a model for these other sphyrnid species and illustrate the potential conservation implications of future magnetic deterrent barrier technologies.","10.3354/esr00629","CE","CE_8344",224,0.306535864724854,-0.221011114414565,"250","negative","negative_250",0

In an effort to reduce rates of bycatch, researchers have tested various deterrents that could benefit fisheries. Permanent magnets are one promising form of bycatch reduction device, yet their efficacy has only been tested for hook-and-line fisheries with variable results. Here, we examined the potential benefits of permanent magnets on an ocean fish trap fishery targeting snapper (Pagrus auratus) where more than 10% of the total catch is comprised of unwanted elasmobranchs and the presence of elasmobranchs reduces the catch of target species. Over 1000 fish traps were deployed in a fishery-dependent survey in New South Wales, Australia. Standardised catch rates indicate that the incorporation of magnets into fish traps significantly reduced incidences of elasmobranch bycatch (mainly Brachaelurus waddi) by over a third, while increasing the amount of target fish caught by an equivalent amount. Together these results suggest that magnets can be used as an effective bycatch reduction device that reduces incidences of elasmobranch bycatch while increasing the profitability of fish traps for fishermen. Future studies should aim to replicate these results in areas where different species of elasmobranchs occur.","10.1016/j.fishres.2018.07.006","CE","CE_8345",210,0.234021988320332,-0.0211421128697243,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Consequently, there is interest in developing strategies to mitigate and minimise shark bycatch within this fishery. This field study examined the behavioural responses of draughtboard sharks to neodymium-iron-boron (Nd2Fe14B) rare earth magnetic rods attached to baited video apparatus. Two magnetic treatments and one control were used in 12 × 1.5 h observational trials conducted in inshore waters of Tasmania, Australia. Results demonstrate that draughtboard sharks: (1) showed substantial individual variation in behaviours both between and within treatments, with no patterns of individual responses observed over time to both magnetic treatments or the control, (2) showed significant differences in initial interactions between the magnetic treatments and the control, and (3) attempted to take bait at the control significantly more often than at the 2-magnet treatment. These findings demonstrate the individualistic and highly variable response behaviours of draughtboard sharks to rare earth magnets. Understanding such behaviours may facilitate the development of effective deterrent strategies in this fishery and improve management of shark-fishery interactions globally.","10.1016/j.fishres.2018.01.001","CE","CE_8346",182,0.244084737953875,-0.0636058386156366,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
8347,2015,"Do by-catch reduction devices in longline fisheries reduce capture of sharks and rays? A global meta-analysis","Fish and Fisheries","By-catch in marine fisheries, particularly those using pelagic and demersal longlines, is a major driver of declines in abundance of sharks and rays around the world. A wide variety of by-catch reduction devices (BRDs), that is, modified gears designed to reduce incidental captures of a variety of marine species while maintaining target catch rates, have been proposed, but the extent to which BRDs actually reduce the risk of catching sharks and rays remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of 27 publications that reported the capture of sharks and rays and, in some cases, of targeted teleosts in longline gear deployed with and without BRDs. The risk of shark and ray capture differed between types of BRDs, but only one BRD type, longlines raised off the bottom, reduced by-catch significantly. Circle hooks did not reduce the risk of capturing sharks and rays but might improve discard survival and are inexpensive, which might make them effective in reducing the detrimental effects of longlining on these species. In addition to being generally ineffective, some devices, such as electropositive and magnetic repellents, are expensive and have inherent construction drawbacks that are likely to make them unsuitable for commercial use. Overall, most BRDs did not affect the likelihood of catching targeted teleosts, but a substantial number of studies did not adequately assess target catch. We identified two poorly studied classes of BRD gear (i.e. raised demersal longlines, and monofilament nylon leaders), which represent promising directions for future research.","10.1111/faf.12055","CE","CE_8347",247,0.333846421590152,-0.12462473112024,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8376,2011,"Effects of a codend mesh size increase on size selectivity and catch rates in a small-mesh bottom trawl fishery for longfin inshore squid, <i>Loligo pealeii</i>","Fisheries Research","Loligo pealeii (longfin inshore squid) co-occurs with Atlantic butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) throughout the year and discarding in the L. pealeii bottom trawl fishery is the primary source of fishing mortality on the butterfish stock. Consequently, a codend mesh size increase in the Loligo fishery has been proposed as a management measure to minimize discarding of butterfish and other bycatch species. A paired-tow study was conducted using a Loligo twin trawl to assess the effects of a codend mesh size increase, from 50. mm to 65. mm (inside stretched mesh), on catch rates and size selection of the target and bycatch species. Relative mesh selection factors estimated from a SELECT model were: 1.7, 1.5, 2.2, and 3.0 for L. pealeii; P. triacanthus; Illex illecebrosus (Northern shortfin squid); and Merluccius bilinearis (silver hake), respectively. Catches of butterfish and silver hake in the 65. mm codend were reduced by 58% and 41% in terms of numbers, respectively. However, a larger mesh size would be necessary to allow 50% escapement of the median sizes of mature silver hake and butterfish. A trade-off associated with the bycatch reductions is a 29% loss in the catch weight of the target species. However, the reduction in ex-vessel value of Loligo catch is probably not proportional to the percent loss in Loligo catch because most of the loss consisted of squid from the smallest market size categories which have the least value and are primarily discarded. In addition, a greater percentage of large, more valuable squid was caught in the 65. mm codend. The September study results likely represent a worst-case scenario with respect to Loligo catch loss because the monthly mean body size of Loligo tends to be smallest during September. Most catches of the three bycatch species evaluated herein and Loligo smaller than 10. cm are discarded, most likely dead, in the Loligo fishery. Therefore, a codend mesh size increase to 65. mm should provide some conservation benefits to these stocks if a portion survive escapement. On a fleet-wide basis, the magnitude of bycatch reductions and Loligo catch loss will vary depending on seasonal changes in mean body size, vessel-specific gear characteristics and fishing practices. © 2010.","10.1016/j.fishres.2010.11.019","CE","CE_8376",352,0.29705111527657,0.0422716136202682,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Two experiments were carried out using the covered codend method; the first used different mesh sizes (56 and 70. mm, knot-centre to knot-centre) and shapes (diamond and square), and the second tested different reduction devices (escape panel and sorting grid).

The Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS) and the Tasmanian Danish-seine fishery (TDSF) use a minimum codend mesh sizes of 90 and 70 mm, respectively. The codend mesh size should be tailored to the LML, which is based on the length of first maturity of females (M50). This study found the length-girth relationship of N. richardsoni and P. bassensis was not significantly different. Using the covered codend method, these two species had 50% retention lengths (L50) of 294 ± 2 and 307 ± 3 mm, in 70-mm and 90-mm codends, respectively. L50 estimates for mesh sizes from this study and others produced a curvilinear relationship: y = 120 ln(x) - 214, with an r2 of 0.8504. The size at maturity (M50) for female N. richardsoni was 337 mm, which is larger than the estimate for female P. bassensis (247 mm). There is a mismatch between the estimates of L50, the estimates of M50 and the LMLs in each fishery, leading to suboptimal exploitation of female Platycephalus.

Data were collected and analyzed for three species, while considering the codend design parameters mesh size (m) and netting direction (T0 or T90) as potential fixed effects for size selection parameters 50% retention length (L50) and selection range (SR). A special model was constructed and model choice was performed separately for red mullet (Mullus barbatus), common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus) and annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis) based on the AIC value (Akaike, 1974) while considering every possible simpler sub-model following the procedure described in Wienbeck et al.

However, L50 and SR values for T0 and T90 codends were found to be similar for annular sea bream. This difference in codend size selectivity between species with regard to turning codend netting orientation by 90° may be related to the difference in body shape.

Gear-based management options can best be explored using models that predict size selection across a wide range of variables related to gear design. Such a model is developed for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) through a meta-analysis of 21 trials of codend selection and 19 trials of the combined selection of the codend and a square mesh panel. Individual-haul estimates of the 50% retention length (l50) and the selection range (SR) are related to a set of explanatory variables through a structural model that describes the dual process of panel and codend selection. Codend l50 and SR are positively related to codend mesh size and negatively related to the codend twine diameter. Codend l50 is also negatively related to the number of open meshes around the codend circumference. Panel l50 increases with panel mesh size. The panel contributes more to gear selection as it is moved closer to the codline. The panel is most effective between November and January and least between May and July, periods which broadly coincide with peak and poor haddock condition. The results are illustrated for a typical trawler targeting haddock in the Scottish whitefish sector, and the utility of the model for gear design and legislation is discussed.","10.1111/faf.12107","CE","CE_8381",244,0.0883906040593535,0.100051880428678,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Increasing mesh size increased the l50 of both species, whilst increasing catch size increased haddock l50 but decreased plaice l50.

This study compared both gears in terms of their fishing characteristics and catches of commercial species based on 16 years of observer data. Danish seining is a specialised fishing method that targeted few species but with higher total catch rates than bottom trawlers. Bottom trawling is a more all-purpose fishing method that targets a larger number of species, and bottom trawlers use larger engines than Danish seiners. A generalised additive mixed model indicated that catch rates of flatfish are generally higher for Danish seines, and catch rates of roundfish species are higher for trawlers. The results do not directly suggest a separation of the gears in terms of legislation as the quantities of fish below current minimum size were similar, but for example future survival studies may reach different conclusions. Additional factors were found to be important in determining catches of both gears.","10.1111/fme.12244","CE","CE_8386",190,0.255058432088012,0.0371287677632251,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

The discard ban to be implemented in January 2016 motivated fishermen to look for technical measures to reduce unwanted catches of undersized individuals (<27 cm). From 20082014, 18 different gear configurations were tested for bycatch reduction on board fleets of vessels of 1620 m and 2024 m. Selective devices tested included grids, square mesh panels (SMP), square mesh cylinders (SMC), various combinations of these devices and large mesh trawls. Using the catch comparison method, our results focus on six devices that proved efficient to reduce catches of undersized whiting, equally divided between the two vessel size groups. Large mesh trawls are not adequate to improve whiting size selectivity with losses of commercial size fish. The mandatory 80-mm SMP was efficient at letting undersized whiting escape from the trawl for both vessel length classes. Its efficiency was enhanced when it was positioned 69 m ahead of the codline compared with that placed at 1215 m. The most appropriate bar spacing for whiting size-selectivity was found in a flexigrid with 23 mm bar spacing, but this required a large portion of square mesh netting to be installed ahead of it (SMP and SMC) to limit catches of undersized individuals. The most promising device tested was an 80 mm SMC, either 2 m long and used alone or 1 m long and used in association with the mandatory SMP; these setups allowed significant escapes of fish up to 25 cm in length. For both SMP and SMC, a mesh size equal to or larger than 100 mm led to losses of commercial size whiting.","10.1016/j.fishres.2017.04.013","CE","CE_8387",268,0.3199231277115,0.0411567088494722,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Vessels alternated hook types throughout the longline gear and maintained a 1:1 ratio of circle hooks to their existing tuna or J-hooks. Observers monitored a total of 1393 sets; 1182 sets were circle hooks vs. tuna hooks and 211 sets were circle hooks vs. J-hooks. The 18 most-caught species were analyzed representing 97.6% of the total catch by number. Two statistical methods were used to assess differences in catch (randomization test) or catch rate (generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs)). There were no significant catch or catch rate (catchability) differences among hook types for bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), the primary target species, with either statistical method. However, GLMMs indicated that catch rates on circle hooks were significantly lower for 16 and 8 species compared to tuna and J-hooks, respectively. There were no significant differences in mean length of bigeye tuna among hook comparisons. Caught condition at retrieval varied considerably among the 18 species. Large circle hooks had greater effects on catch rates than on fish size selectivity and fish survival. We contend that reduced catch rates are a function of 18/0 circle hook shape, where the minimum width (4.9. cm) was 57% and 25% wider than the Japanese tuna (3.1. cm) and J-hook (3.9. cm), respectively. In contrast to tuna hooks, large circle hooks have conservation potential for use in the world's pelagic tuna longline fleets for some highly migratory species, with catch rate reductions of 29.2-48.3% for billfish species and 17.1-27.5% for sharks. © 2011.","10.1016/j.fishres.2011.02.013","CE","CE_8401",271,0.119431606060496,0.104041246774996,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Pelagic fishing at seamounts, where hyperstability of pelagic predators may occur, can exacerbate declining abundance and have high bycatch of species groups that are highly vulnerable to overexploitation. Generalized additive mixed Poisson regression models (GAMMs) were fitted to Hawaii longline tuna fishery observer data to determine temporal trends in standardized catch rates, an index for local, relative abundance. Temporal trends in expectile length distributions were determined through geoadditive expectile GAMMs. Significant declining trends in relative abundance in this fishery were observed for tunas, sharks and billfish. A decline in seabird standardized catch rate occurred concurrently with the uptake of seabird bycatch mitigation technology. Changed spatial distribution of fishing effort and increased use of wider circle hooks likely contributed to a declining sea turtle standardized catch rate. Tuna and billfish mean lengths significantly increased over the time series due to entire distributions of length classes having shifted towards larger fish. Larger tunas comprised a larger proportion of the catch due to fewer small tunas being caught, and to a lesser extent because mean lengths of larger size classes increased. Conversely, billfish largest length classes experienced the largest increases in average lengths. Changes in spatial and seasonal distributions of fishing effort, increased use of wider circle hooks, and possibly increasing purse seine selective removals of juvenile tunas, may have contributed to increased selectivity for larger fish. Significant differences in standardized catch rates and length distributions at a shallow seamount vs. the open ocean confirms the aggregating effect of seamounts on pelagic predators, including juvenile market species of pelagic fish and species groups relatively vulnerable to overexploitation. Wider circle hooks significantly improved valuable tuna standardized catch rates, but also increased unwanted shark and reduced valuable billfish standardized catch rates. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd..","10.1002/aqc.2237","CE","CE_8404",322,0.173970571956158,0.0454265733625232,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

In total, 310 longline experimental sets (446 400 hooks) were deployed between October 2008 and February 2012. Three different hook styles were tested; the traditional J-hook (9/0) 10o offset was compared with two 17/0 circle hooks (a non-offset and a 10o offset), and squid (Illex spp.) bait was compared with mackerel (Scomber spp.). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was calculated for each fish species per fishing set and compared between the different hook style and bait type combinations. Results indicated that the effects of hook style and bait on the CPUEs were species-specific. For example, swordfish (target species, Xiphias gladius) CPUEs were higher with J-hooks baited with squid, while for the blue shark (most important bycatch species, Prionace glauca) the highest CPUEs were obtained with circle hooks baited with mackerel. For tuna (Thunnus spp.) and marlin (blue, Makaira nigricans and white, Kajikia albida) only the bait effect was significant, with higher catches with squid. For the discarded species, the proportions of alive vs dead specimens at the time of fishing gear retrieval were also species-specific.

Individual and synergistic effects on elasmobranch catch and survival from pelagic longline gear factors, including methods prescribed to mitigate bycatch of other vulnerable taxa, were determined. Overall relative risk of higher circle vs. J-shaped hook shark catch rates conditioned on potentially informative moderators, from 30 studies, was estimated using an inverse-precision weighted mixed-effects meta-regression modelling approach. Sharks had a 1.20 times (95% CI: 1.031.39) significantly higher pooled relative risk of capture on circle hooks, with two significant moderators. The pooled relative risk estimate of ray circle hook catch from 15 studies was not significant (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.891.66) with no significant moderators. From a literature review, wire leaders had higher shark catch and haulback mortality than monofilament. Interacting effects of hook, bait and leader affect shark catch rates: hook shape and width and bait type determine hooking position and ability to sever monofilament leaders. Circle hooks increased elasmobranch catch, but reduced haulback mortality and deep hooking relative to J-shaped hooks of the same or narrower width. Using fish vs. squid for bait increased shark catch and deep hooking. Pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) catch and mortality were lower on wider hooks. Using circle instead of J-shaped hooks and fish instead of squid for bait, while benefitting sea turtles, odontocetes and possibly seabirds, exacerbates elasmobranch catch and injury, therefore warranting fishery-specific assessments to determine relative risks.","10.1111/faf.12143","CE","CE_8406",250,0.318642327449757,-0.288477614279612,"250","negative","negative_250",0
8407,2017,"The effects of hook and bait sizes on size selectivity and capture efficiency in Icelandic longline fisheries","Fisheries Research","One of the major problems in marine fisheries is that species and sizes outside the range of those targeted may be captured, leading to discards. Although longline fishing is characterised by low energy consumption, low bycatch of non-target species and high catch quality, bycatch of undersized fish has been found to be a problem in some fisheries. We studied the effects of bait size and hook size on catching efficiency and size selectivity in the Icelandic longline fisheries targeting cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), tusk (Brosme brosme), ling (Molva molva) and wolffish (Anarhichas lupus). Five sizes of EZ-Baiter hooks (sizes 10 - 14) and two sizes (10 and 30 g) of Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) bait were tested in six fishing trials. There was a significant size selectivity effect for bait size in that larger bait caught more large fish and fewer small fish of all species, apart from ling. The large bait caught 45, 56, 35 and 76% more (by weight) cod, wolffish, tusk and ling, respectively. Haddock catches were reduced by 57% when the large bait was used. Increasing hook size lowered capture efficiency for all species, but had only a minor effect on size selectivity. Our results thus demonstrate that hook size and bait size affect the profitability of longline fisheries, in that smaller hooks improve capture efficiency, while larger baits increase catches of large fish and reduce those of undersized fish.","10.1016/j.fishres.2017.02.017","CE","CE_8407",228,0.299711474448814,-0.158517033631038,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Analyses of observer programme data from the Fiji longline fishery from 2011 to 2014 were conducted to characterize the shark and ray catch composition and identify factors that significantly explained standardized catch rates. Catch data were fitted to generalized linear models to identify potentially significant explanatory variables. With a nominal catch rate of 0.610 elasmobranchs per 1000 hooks, a total of 27 species of elasmobranchs were captured, 48% of which are categorized as Threatened under the IUCN Red List. Sharks and rays made up 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively, of total fish catch. Blue sharks and pelagic stingrays accounted for 51% and 99% of caught sharks and rays, respectively. There was near elimination of shark lines, branchlines set at or near the sea surface via attachment directly to floats, after 2011. Of caught elasmobranchs, 35% were finned, 11% had the entire carcass retained, and the remainder was released alive or discarded dead. Finning of elasmobranchs listed in CITES Appendix II was not observed in 2014. There were significantly higher standardized shark and ray catch rates on narrower J-shaped hooks than on wider circle hooks. Based on findings from previous studies on single factor effects of hook width and shape, the smaller minimum width of the J-shaped hooks may have caused the higher shark and ray catch rates. For sharks, the effect of hook width may have exceeded the effect of hook shape, where small increases in shark catch rates have been observed on circle vs J-shaped hooks. Shark and ray standardized catch rates were lowest in the latter half of the year. Focusing effort during the second half of the year could reduce elasmobranch catch rates.

Results were compared from 65 sets from six commercial fishing vessels totalling 50 800 hooks in which ringed and non-ringed 16/0 circle hooks with a 10° offset were alternated along the length of the longline. In total, 464 individuals were caught in the 4 years of experiment, with swordfish (Xiphias gladius) comprising 83% of the total number of animals captured. Catch rates of targeted swordfish were significantly higher on ringed hooks (CPUEringed hooks = 8.465, CPUEnon-ringed hooks = 6.654). Results indicate that ringed circle hooks captured significantly more small-sized swordfish than non-ringed circle hooks (27.7% vs. 19.5%, respectively). For species with sufficient sample sizes, the odds ratio (OR) of a capture was in favour of ringed hooks; significantly for swordfish (OR = 1.27 95%CI 1.041.57), and not significantly for bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) (OR = 1.50, 95%CI 0.683.42) nor for pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrigon violacea) (OR = 1.13, 95%CI 0.542.36). All six loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and three of the four blue sharks (Prionace glauca) were captured on ringed hooks, however, the small sample sizes prevented meaningful statistical analysis. In summary, results from this study suggest that the addition of a ring to 16/0 circle hooks confers higher catchability for small-sized commercial swordfish, and does not significantly reduce catch rate of bycatch species and protected species in a Mediterranean shallow pelagic longline fishery. These findings should motivate fisheries managers to consider factors in addition to hook shape when aiming to promote sustainable fishing practices. The presence of a ring has the potential to negate some conservation benefits.

Our study included more data than previous meta-analyses of the effects of hook type, due to both a larger number of relevant studies available in recent years and a more general modelling approach. Data from 42 empirical studies were analysed using a random effects model to compare the effects of circle hooks and J-hooks on catch rate (43 species) and at-vessel mortality (31 species) of target and bycatch species. Catch rates with circle hooks were greater for 11 species, including four tuna species, six shark species and one Istiophorid billfish. Catch rates on circle hooks were lower for seven species, including two Istiophorid billfishes and two species of sea turtle. At-vessel mortality was significantly lower with circle hooks in 12 species, including three tuna species, three Istiophorid billfishes, swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and three shark species. No species had significantly greater at-vessel mortality when captured with a circle hook rather than a J-hook. While our general approach increased model variability compared to more detailed studies, results were consistent with trends identified in previous studies that compared the catch rates and at-vessel mortality (between hook types) for a number of species. Our results suggest that circle hooks can be a promising tool to reduce mortality of some bycatch species in pelagic longline fisheries, although the effects depend on the species and the metric (catch rate or at-vessel mortality), emphasizing the need for fishery-specific data in conservation and management decisions.","10.1111/faf.12260","CE","CE_8410",262,0.299808870692525,0.0974364401976867,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Bite-offs (i.e. missing hooks) corresponded to ~33% of the shark catch and occurred mostly on nylon leaders (97%). Hook type had no significant effect on catchability or mortality of any species or groups. However, nylon leaders caught more bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus and all target species combined, while wire leaders caught more blue shark, Prionace glauca and all sharks combined. If bite-offs were assumed to be undetected sharks, differences in shark catchability between leader types disappear. Moreover, significant differences in blue shark catch rate between leader types was found in J-hook treatments only. Higher proportions of live sharks were found on wire leaders.

8429,2011,"Assessing the effectiveness of size limits and escape gaps as management tools in a commercial rock lobster (<i>Jasus edwardsii</i>) fishery","Fisheries Research","Minimum legal sizes (MLSs) and escape gaps are two commonly used management tools within commercial lobster fisheries. This study examined their effectiveness within the spatially expansive (~207,000km2) Northern Zone rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) fishery of South Australia. Firstly, spatially explicit estimates of size of maturity (SOM) and relative reproductive potential were estimated to examine if the current minimum legal size of 105mm carapace length (CL) was appropriate. Size of maturity ranged from 105 to 118mm CL with 90% of reproductive potential coming from size classes above 105mm CL. SOM generally tended to increase from east to west and indicated that while the current MLS of 105mm CL may be appropriate for Marine Fishing Areas (MFAs) in the eastern part of the fishery, a higher MLS (>110mm CL) should be considered for MFAs in the western region of the zone. As size of maturity is age, rather than size dependent, these results may reflect differences in growth rates and highlight the importance of considering spatial variation in reproductive characteristics when applying size limits to lobster resources. Escape gap effectiveness was examined by estimating catch rates of undersized lobsters and commonly caught bycatch species, before and after mandatory introduction in 2003. After 2003, catch rates of undersized lobsters decreased by >60% while blue-throat wrasse (Notolabrus tetricus) and leatherjacket species (Meuschenia hippocrepis and Meuschenia australis) decreased by >50%. The findings have implications for the Southern Zone of South Australia where fishing effort is substantially higher but where escape gaps are not mandatory. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2011.06.006","CE","CE_8429",247,0.247230062365243,0.178249919095894,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The estimated length at 50% retention was found to be a direct function of fish body length (girth) and mesh size of the escape window, while the estimated selection range remained unchanged regardless of mesh size. Optimal mesh size, with respect to the length at 50% retention and current minimal landing size of 38. cm in the Baltic, was determined to be 45. mm. Strong indications (significant on the 0.01 probability level in the case of 50 and 40. mm escape windows) suggested that the relative fishing power of the pots increased with the implementation of an escape window. This result could be explained as a "" saturation effect"" , i.e. the probability of cod entering the pot is likely to be negatively dependent on cod density in the pot. The high species selectivity and the low catch rate of undersized fish have consolidated the floating pots position as a highly benign fishing method and the foremost alternative gear for the future coastal cod fishery in the Baltic Sea. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.023","CE","CE_8431",282,0.210487330119582,0.124198501866518,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Five replicates of four traps, including ""hoop nets"", rigid ""wire pots"", and collapsible ""round"" and ""rectangular"" pots were deployed for 3, 6 and 24 h in two Australian estuaries. Trapped S. serrata were ""discarded"" into cages and monitored with controls over 3 d. All S. serrata were assessed for damage, while subsets of immediately caught and monitored individuals had haemolymph constituents quantified as stress indices. All traps retained similar-sized (8.119.1 cm carapace width) S. serrata, with catches positively correlated to deployment duration. Round pots were the most efficient for S. serrata and fishmostly Acanthopagrus australis (3 mortality). Hoop nets were the least efficient and were often damaged. No S. serrata died, but 18 were wounded (biased towards hoop nets), typically involving a missing swimmeret. Physiological responses were mild and mostly affected by biological factors. The results validate discarding unwanted S. serrata for controlling exploitation, but larger mesh sizes or escape vents in pots and restrictions on hoop nets would minimise unnecessary catches, pollution and ghost fishing. © 2012 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

8433,2013,"A trap with a twist: evaluating a bycatch reduction device to prevent rockfish capture in crustacean traps","ICES Journal of Marine Science","Bycatch, or the incidental capture of non-target species, occurs in fisheries around the world, with often detrimental ecological consequences. Bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) that increase catch specificity have been used successfully in some fisheries, and the development of such devices remains an important component of the global effort to reduce bycatch rates. We tested novel devices designed to exclude juvenile rockfish (Sebastes spp.) from traps used to catch spot prawns (Pandalus platyceros), a commercially important species in British Columbia, Canada. The devices included reductions in trap opening sizes and novel bent-tunnel openings. Reducing trap opening size did not affect bycatch rates of rockfish or other non-target fish species. In contrast, bent-tunnel BRDs eliminated rockfish bycatch, and two of the bent-tunnel variants also excluded other fish species. However, prawn catch rates were reduced in all modified gear, and large prawns were often excluded more than small prawns. Videos recorded in situ revealed that prawn attempts to enter traps took longer and were more likely to fail in BRD-equipped than in unmodified traps. We conclude that bent-tunnel BRDs have the potential to be useful, but improvements are needed to increase prawn catch to levels similar to that of unmodified traps. © 2012 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.","10.1093/icesjms/fss138","CE","CE_8433",213,0.331990156613893,-0.0575670460830056,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8434,2012,"Survival of juvenile herring (<i>Clupea harengas membras</i>) after passing through a selection grid in a pontoon trap","Fisheries Research","A common problem in the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Bothnian herring trap fishery is the bycatch of undersized Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras). By equipping a pontoon trap with a rigid grid with vertical bars, a substantial proportion of the undersized herring can escape from the gear by swimming through the grid. However, it has not been clear whether or not the young fish are injured by their passage through a grid and what their fate is. The purpose of this study was to investigate the short term mortality of herring after passage through a grid. To capture young herring, a selection grid was mounted at the entrance to the fish chamber of a pontoon trap, so that only young herring (approximately 12-18. cm in length) could swim in. The trap was then closed and the herring were confined in the fish chamber for seven days before assessing survival rates. The same procedure was performed with control herring which were trapped without passing through any grid. The whole trial was repeated three times. On average about 7% of the young herring selected through a sorting grid died during the experiment. The results demonstrated that passing through a rigid grid did not affect the short term mortality of young herring during the seven days in captivity. The highest mortality (45%) was in fact observed in one of the control groups presumably in connection with extreme temperature fluctuations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2012.05.009","CE","CE_8434",237,0.126945489205727,-0.102041498979182,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The total monetary value of the gated trap catches was maintained in a heavily fished environment, while it increased in the less fisheries-depleted area.For the most important local commercial species, the African white-spotted rabbitfish (Siganus sutor), the gated traps significantly increased the mean length (by 12%) and weight (by 32%) of capture and decreased the proportion of catch under length at first maturity (Lmat) from 56% (traditional traps) to 25% (gated traps).Escape gaps have shown the potential to affect the structure of the fishery and ecosystem by enhancing the number of mature individuals, increasing reef biodiversity and promoting functionally diverse reef fish communities without compromising fisher's revenues.","10.1002/aqc.2389","CE","CE_8435",219,0.135082596883554,0.136971031018192,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

In the Baltic Sea trap fishery, the major problem is the bycatch of juvenile and non-marketable whitefish (Coregonus maraena) which constitutes a threat to the sustainability of the fishery and a time-consuming problem for the fishers. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a modified fish trap in reducing such bycatch. An encircling selection panel consisting of 50 × 50 mm square mesh netting was installed in a pontoon fish chamber of a salmon/whitefish trap. Comparative fishing was conducted against a control trap without selection panel in the inshore waters of the Bothnian Sea. Comparisons of catch compositions between the traps showed that there was a 72% reduction in juvenile whitefish catch in the experimental trap. The length at 50% retention (30.1 cm) corresponded well to the minimum market size (>30 cm) of whitefish that are desired for the local market. Fishers are advised to use a netting panel of 50. ×. 50. mm square mesh for their traps to reduce undersized whitefish. The results are important for the sustainability of whitefish stocks in the Baltic Sea.","10.1016/j.fishres.2014.08.020","CE","CE_8437",196,0.258336652850119,0.00752469117252608,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
8438,2015,"The efficiency of selection grids in perch pontoon traps","Fisheries Research","In commercial fishing, minimizing the bycatch of undersized fish or non-target species is highly beneficial, to avoid unnecessary fish mortality and to save time for the fishers. Two pontoon traps developed for perch fishing were equipped with size selection grids, and the efficiency with which under-sized fish could escape was tested. Average size of perch, roach, and whitefish was larger in traps with selection grids compared to in control traps without grids. Selection efficiencies using these comparisons were 82-86% for perch, 33% for whitefish and 100% for roach. The selection grids were filmed with an underwater video camera over the daily cycle, to estimate timing, and total number of exits from the traps. Selection efficiencies, calculated by extrapolating number of escapes observed to the total time of trap submergence, were 94-100% for perch and 100% for roach. The discrepancy in the selection efficiency estimates for perch probably depends on an uncertainty in the extrapolation, because of the variation in escape rate across time periods. Perch and roach differed in time of day for escapes. For perch most escapees was seen in the evening, and for roach most fish escaped at night, probably reflecting the general activity cycles of the two species. Over a fishing season, several thousands of fish would be able to escape from each trap, and an increase in the use of size selection grids could potentially be an efficient tool for fish population management.","10.1016/j.fishres.2014.09.017","CE","CE_8438",234,0.0990649809434607,-0.0861844550149583,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8439,2016,"Can optimal trap mesh size be predicted from body depth in a laterally-compressed fish species?","Fisheries Research","We used fish body depth to predict trap center-to-center mesh sizes that would optimize size selection of black sea bass Centropristis striata for both current and proposed minimum size limits for this species. We fished trap types of five different square mesh sizes/configurations: (1) 38.1 mm mesh, (2) 38.1 mm mesh on five sides and 50.8 mm mesh on one side (back panel trap), (3) 50.8 mm mesh, (4) 57.2 mm mesh, and (5) 63.5 mm mesh. The 38.1 mm mesh trap was the control trap type. Back panel traps are the minimally legal mesh configuration in this region while 50.8 mm mesh traps are commonly used in this fishery to further reduce culling of sub-legal black sea bass by fishers. Two previously untested mesh sizes, 57.2 and 63.5 mm, were evaluated because a previously published morphometric relationship between black sea bass body depth and total length (TL) predicted that the diagonal openings of these two respective mesh sizes would retain black sea bass close to the current (279 mm) and proposed minimum TL limits (305 mm). We estimated size selection of each experimental trap type by comparing catches of control and experimental traps. All but the back panel trap displayed relatively steep selection around the fish length at which 50% of individuals were selected (l50). Initial size at retention (l10) by the 57.2 and 63.5 mm trap types were nearly identical to current and proposed minimum fish sizes, respectively. Predictions from the body depth: TL relationship were very similar to estimates of l10 and l50, based on uncompressed body depth and compression to 93%. The 57.2 mm mesh and 63.5 mm mesh trap types maintained catches of legal fish but reduced catches of sub-legal fish compared to the back panel and 50.8 mm mesh trap types. Relative to back panel and 50.8 mm mesh traps, use of 57.2 mm mesh traps would reduce rates of discard and discard mortality given current size limits in this fishery.","10.1016/j.fishres.2016.03.007","CE","CE_8439",306,0.147036777327511,-0.209881875394196,"350","negative","negative_350",0
8440,2017,"Floated cod pots with one entrance reduce probability of escape and increase catch rates compared with pots with two entrances","Fisheries Research","The development of low impact and fuel efficient (LIFE) fishing is being paid growing attention. Pot fishing has lower environmental impact and fuel consumption than most other fishing methods. However, pots typically have low capture efficiency for most ground-fish species, and efforts to develop effective commercial pots are needed. Bycatch of red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) is a severe problem in the coastal fishery for cod (Gadus morhua) in the Barents Sea. In a previous publication, we demonstrated that cod pots floated off the bottom eliminated this problem. Our original bottom-set cod pot has two entrances in order to increase the rate of entry of fish, but when this pot is floated, fish that search for food by following chemical cues up-current will only encounter the entrance that is oriented down-current. We therefore compared the catch rates of floated pots with one and two entrances, and predicted that the new design with only one entrance would achieve higher catch rates due to a lower rate of escape. Pots with one entrance caught significantly more cod and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) than pots with two entrances. The catch rate of cod above minimum landing size (=44 cm) of pots with one entrance was 82% higher than that of pots with two entrances. Pots that were snagged and did not float properly caught large numbers of king crab. The larger catches of pots with one entrance could be explained by lower escape rate from this design. The observed difference in catch rates between the two pot types indicates that more than 50% of the large cod and haddock that entered the pot with two entrances escaped. There is therefore great potential for increased catching efficiency of pots through improved pot design.","10.1016/j.fishres.2016.10.016","CE","CE_8440",289,0.27134051419603,0.0891336863811143,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Even though most attempts at control of this species have failed, a recently implemented fishery in Atlantic Canada aims to control its populations and mitigate its negative effects. The use of fyke nets to capture green crabs could reduce the cost of fishing and increase the financial incentive to harvest this species. However, these nets are currently not permitted for fishing this species because they potentially capture large amounts of bycatch in a sensitive ecological zone. Hence, the primary goal of this study was to design and assess the effectiveness of a novel bycatch reduction device (BRD) installed on traditional fyke nets. Fyke nets were deployed in pairs at four shallow subtidal sites in eastern Prince Edward Island and sampled over 16 consecutive days in summer 2016. Both catch (green crab) and bycatch counts in the original fyke nets were significantly higher than in the nets equipped with a BRD. However, bycatch diversity was significantly lower in the BRD equipped nets, and proportionally less detrimental to three economically and ecologically important bycatch species.","10.1016/j.fishres.2018.02.018","CE","CE_8441",186,0.195191233312643,0.0269976739858864,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

The primary focus of the study was evaluating trawl system modifications for reducing bycatch of eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) below levels already achieved via mandatory use of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs). An experimental footrope, modified by removing the central one third of the trawl groundline, reduced eulachon bycatch by 33.9%. It also reduced bycatch of slender sole (Lyopsetta exilis), other small flatfishes and juvenile darkblotched rockfish (Sebastes crameri) by 80% or more, but had no effect on bycatch of whitebait smelt (Allosmerus elongatus) or Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). The experimental groundline also reduced the catch of ocean shrimp (weight) by 22.2% in hauls yielding commercial quantities of shrimp (>194. kg/haul) and by 23.2% in all hauls. Reducing bar spacing in a rigid-grate BRD from 25.4. mm to 19.1. mm reduced eulachon bycatch by 16.6%, with no reduction in ocean shrimp catch.

8467,2011,"Effect of mesh size and codend circumference on selectivity in the Mediterranean demersal trawl fisheries","Fisheries Research","The effects of mesh size and codend circumference on selectivity of some commercially important species were evaluated. Four different codends were used in the sea trials. The nominal mesh sizes tested were 48. mm and 56. mm and two different nominal circumferences were associated with each mesh size. Selectivity experiments were carried out in the Central Adriatic Sea, in the course of two different periods of the year (May and September 2005) on two different fishing grounds normally exploited by local fishermen. Reliable selectivity results were obtained for red mullet (Mullus barbatus), little squid (Alloteuthis media) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius). For all the species, the codend circumference plays a role which is as important as mesh size. The positive effect of increasing mesh size, from 48. mm to 56. mm, could be made fruitless by an increase in codend circumference. According to species, the change only in the mesh size from 48. mm to 56. mm significantly increases L50 by +15-42%, while by increasing only the codend circumference of around 13-17%, L50 decreases by 9-41%, thus being effective as by increasing mesh size. As a consequence the selection factor (i.e. SF is the ratio of L50 and the codend mesh size) depends on the codend circumference and does not result mesh-size-independent.

8469,2015,"Size selection in codends made of thin-twined Dyneema netting compared to standard codends: a case study with cod, plaice and flounder","Fisheries Research","In an experimental trawl fishery, diamond mesh codends made out of 2.5. mm flexible Dyneema twine were tested. The principle aim was to investigate the effect of the number of meshes in the codend circumference, the number of twines (single or double), and netting orientation (T0 or T90) on the size selection of cod (Gadus morhua), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and flounder (Platichthys flesus). In addition, the obtained size selectivity for the codends made of Dyneema netting were compared to results obtained for T90 codends made of standard 5. mm single twine PE netting, and to previous results for other PE codends used in the same fishery. It was observed that the selective performance of the Dyneema netting codends was very high compared to other T0 and T90 codends of the same mesh size and number of meshes in the codends circumference. This demonstrates the high selective potential of the thin and flexible Dyneema netting compared to nettings which are traditionally used in the construction of trawl codends. Furthermore, reducing the number of meshes in the codend circumference for the Dyneema codends significantly increased the size selection of cod but did not affect the size selection of plaice and flounder. This difference between the species is likely linked to their different morphologies. No differences in the size selection of the T0 and T90 designs made of Dyneema twine tested were observed for any of the three species. For cod, the effect of using single or double twine in the Dyneema codends was also tested, however, no significant differences were found.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.01.014","CE","CE_8469",257,0.14904353132355,0.141714795846502,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

To investigate the potentials and challenges of these paradigm shifts, a 6-months unrestricted gear' trial was performed in Denmark in 2015. Twelve trawlers were challenged to test their own solutions to reduce unwanted bycatch and/or choke species, while maintaining profitable. The participating fishers tested different options depending on their fishery and the type of issues they faced individually, and adjusted their test fishery over time through incremental small steps. Nine vessels reduced discard ratio in the test fishery, one showed no difference between test and control fishery, while two vessels displayed an increase in discard ratio. Catch compositions also differed, with fewer ""choke species"" occurring in the test fisheries and a more valuable size composition. Ultimately, despite smaller landings in multiple vessels, no vessel showed reduction in value-per-unit-effort (VPUE) and one Baltic vessel significantly increased the VPUE. This trial showed that relaxing technical regulations combined with proper incentives has a potential to provide some flexibility to cope with the landing obligation, where unwanted catches could be reduced to some extent without negative effects on economic viability.","10.1093/icesjms/fsw209","CE","CE_8470",202,0.26700463488731,0.0276674464149906,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The first modification involved restricting the angle of attack (AOA) of a flat-rectangular otter board to <30° by attaching a restraining line to an adjacent sled, while the second was a 'batwing' otter board comprising a sled-and-sail assembly operating at 20° AOA.

Further, compared to all other trawls, the restrained trawls caught less discarded bycatch (by up to 37%), while the trawls spread by the modified flat-rectangular and batwing otter boards caught more individuals of three retained benthic teleost species per ha than the conventional configuration; results that were attributed to species-specific herding responses.

Experiments involved paired penaeid trawls (7.35-m headlines). The first experiment compared the batwing otter boards against all other designs (using 41-mm mesh trawls). In experiment 2, the batwing was tested against the flat-rectangular design (with 32-mm mesh trawls). In experiment 3, the batwing and flat-rectangular otter boards were towed without trawls to facilitate estimates of their partitioned drag. Overall, compared to the conventional otter boards, the batwings had up to ~86 and ~18% less bottom contact and drag, respectively. Among the conventional otter boards, the trawls spread by the cambered design caught up to 13% more school prawns Metapenaeus macleayi attributed to their greater solid profile. No significant differences were detected among catches of fish in the trawls spread by the various otter boards. The results reaffirm that because otter boards contribute towards a large proportion of total system drag (estimated here at up to ~56%), their appropriate configuration is essential to maximise the fuel efficiency of penaeid-trawl systems.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.02.013","CE","CE_8472",211,0.211044168736548,0.0981861068451865,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

This study tested the hypothesis that a novel otter-board design, termed the ""batwing"" (comprising a 0.1-m wide sled with an offset sail at 208 AOA) would have relatively fewer bottom impacts than a conventional flat-rectangular otter board (358 AOA, with a similar hydrodynamic spreading force). Pairs of each otter board were suspended beneath a purpose-built rig comprising a beam and posterior semi-pelagic collection net and repeatedly deployed across established trawl grounds in an Australian estuary. Compared with the conventional otter boards, the batwings displaced significantly fewer empty shells (Anadara trapezia and Spisula trigonella) by 89% and school prawns (Metapenaeus macleayi) by up to 78%. These rates were similar to the difference in base-plate bottom contact (87%). Further, the batwing damaged proportionally fewer damaged shells, attributed to their displacement away from the board's surface area. Other debris (lighter pieces of wood) and benthic fish (bridled gobies, Arenigobius bifrenatus) were not as greatly mobilised (i.e. reduced by 50 and 25%, respectively); possibly due to their position on or slightly off the bottom, and a similar influence of hydrodynamic displacement by the hydro-vane surface areas. Although the consequences of reducing otter-board bottom contact largely remain unknown, low AOA designs like the batwing may represent a practical option for fisheries where trawling is perceived to be hazardous to sensitive habitats.","10.1093/icesjms/fsv100","CE","CE_8473",244,0.167797375830491,-0.126461014129171,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8475,2015,"Reduced herding of flounders by floating bridles: application in Gulf of Maine northern shrimp trawls to reduce bycatch","ICES Journal of Marine Science","We hypothesized that a floating trawl bridle that does not contact the seabed would reduce the herding of fish, especially bottom dwelling flounders, and thus reduce bycatch of these fish in shrimp trawls. We further hypothesized that, due to the non-herding nature of northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), the use of an off-bottom floating bridle would not reduce shrimp catch. These hypotheses were tested in the field by comparing a trawl with regular bottom-tendering wire bridles and the same trawl with floating synthetic bridles in the Gulf of Maine northern shrimp fishery. As expected, no statistically significant differences in catch rates and size were found for the targeted northern shrimp (146.3 ± 10.58 kg h-1 control vs. 140.8 ± 9.35 kg h-1, p = 0.13). Total finfish bycatch was reduced by 14.9%, and the difference was statistically different (p = 0.01). The most important reduction was the catch of juvenile American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) with a significant reduction of 20.0% (p = 0.01). For witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), a reduction of 19.3% was found, but it was not statistically significant (p = 0.14). The reduction of Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus) (by 28.0%, p = 0.02) was also statistically different. Catch of targeted silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) was reduced by 10.8%, but the difference was only marginally significant (p = 0.07). An analysis of length frequencies for the targeted shrimp and major bycatch species revealed no size-related selection between the gears with regular bridles and floating bridles. The reductions in flounder bycatch indicate reduced herding of benthic species when the bridles are kept off bottom. This easy modification may be readily adopted in the northern shrimp fisheries in the North Atlantic, and can also possibly be applied in other shrimp and prawn fisheries with further experimentation.","10.1093/icesjms/fsu235","CE","CE_8475",275,0.138642323291072,0.0108820411971657,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8476,2015,"A simple technical measure to reduce bycatch and discard of skates and sharks in mixed-species bottom-trawl fisheries","ICES Journal of Marine Science","Due to global declines, skates and sharks have become a focus of marine conservation in recent years. Despite protective measures, they remain vulnerable to bycatch by fisheries, especially bottom-trawls and pose a problem for fisheries management measures that aim to eliminate discards in the future. In the mixed-species bottom-trawl fisheries of the North Atlantic catches can be increased by fitting a length of chain known as a ""tickler"" in front of the groundgear of the trawl. It was hypothesized that the tickler is especially effective at catching skates and rays that may otherwise escape beneath the net. A trial was undertaken with paired tows with and without the tickler chain. The trial demonstrated that the catch rate of skates and sharks can be significantly lowered by removing the tickler. A set of secondary nets (groundgear bags) attached behind the groundgear of the main net allowed the number of fish escaping under the net to be estimated and showed that the reduction of skates and sharks in the main net was accompanied by an increase in number in the groundgear bags. This suggests that prohibition of the use of tickler chains in areas that are known to be especially important to skates and sharks could have conservation benefits. The removal of the tickler chain had little effect on catch rates of haddock, whiting, and flatfish, but caused a marked decrease in the catch rate of commercially valuable anglerfish.","10.1093/icesjms/fsv037","CE","CE_8476",240,0.156061442070734,0.0725610897504185,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

For a given twine thickness: going from T0 to T90 increases selectivity of cod; while going from single to double reduce it. Increasing twine thickness reduces selection but the extent depends on whether the twine is single or double and whether the netting orientation is T0 or T90. In general, the results demonstrate the benefit of using a relatively thin single twine netting to ensure the appropriate size selection with round fish and the best results were obtained using netting with a T90 orientation. For a given twine thickness going from T0 to T90 decreases selectivity of plaice. Increasing twine thickness reduces selection for plaice. Our results demonstrate that very different selectivity results can be obtained using the same mesh size, simply by varying the twine thickness, the twine number, and the netting orientation.

8483,2015,"Species selectivity in different sized topless trawl designs: Does size matter?","Fisheries Research","Most demersal trawl fisheries are conducted in a multispecies setting, and the catch consists of several different species. An inherent challenge in such fisheries is to provide both biologically and economically sustainable exploitation of individually fluctuating stocks and vessel- or fleet-specific quotas. The topless trawl design was developed to improve species-specific selectivity in such fisheries. In a topless trawl, the foot rope is located more forward than the headline to allow fish to escape upwards, whereas the headline is located in front in traditional trawl designs. In this study we conducted twin trawls with a topless trawl towed parallel to a similar standard trawl; we tested a topless trawl design on a small trawl with a low headline height and on a larger trawl with a high headline height. We conducted the tows in the Nephrops (Nephrops norvegicus) directed mixed fisheries. For both the small and large trawls, we found a significant topless effect for haddock (Melanogramus aeglefinus) and no effect for Nephrops. For Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) we found a significant topless effect for the low headline trawl but no effect for the high headline trawl. In both the eastern and western Atlantic, topless trawls have been introduced as legal cod-selective trawl designs. However, this study demonstrates that identical gear modifications made to similar trawls of different sizes and used in the same fishery can lead to different results.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.07.010","CE","CE_8483",233,0.138532742190397,0.184077675160711,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Previous studies using topless trawls (i.e. trawls with a headrope more than 20% longer than the footrope) in this region showed reductions of cod, but also reductions in species of flatfish. In May and June 2011, we tested a topless trawl on a commercial trawler with a much greater headrope to footrope ratio and greater flotation than previous studies in the region. Thirty haul-pairs were successfully conducted and demonstrated a 51% reduction in the catch of cod, with no significant loss of any flatfish species, except for a significant loss of sublegal American plaice. Our results suggest that a topless trawl can be an effective method of cod avoidance for fishermen in the region, without substantial loss of landable flatfish. We infer from the results that: cod rise in response to an approaching trawl footrope and sand cloud; headrope layback may not be a critical value in the effectiveness of topless trawl designs; and, headrope flotation, particularly in the center of the headrope, may be an important factor in retaining flatfish.","10.1016/j.fishres.2016.09.014","CE","CE_8484",191,0.133022478965344,0.107551022227014,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

High fuel consumption, seabed disturbance and high discard rates are well-known disadvantages of this fishing technique. These shortcomings are increasingly gaining international public and political attention, especially with the upcoming discard ban in Europe. The most promising alternative fishing technique meeting both the fisherman's aspirations, and the need for ecological progress is pulse fishing with electrotrawls. Here, the mechanical stimulation by tickler chains or bobbins is replaced by electrical stimulation resulting in reduced bottom contact, fuel costs and discards. Although a significant amount of research has been done on electrotrawls and their impact on marine organisms, most data were published in very diverse sources ranging from local non-peer-reviewed reports with a limited distribution to highly consulted international peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, there is a clear need for a comprehensive yet concise and critical overview, covering and summarizing all these data and making these available for the scientific community. This article aims to meet the above goals by discussing the working principle of electric fields, the history of electrotrawls and their current application in the North Sea and impact on marine organisms.

8499,2012,"Assessment of relative performance of a square-mesh codend design across multiple vessels in a demersal trawl fishery","Fisheries Research","Implementing gear-based solutions to reduce bycatch in trawl fisheries can be difficult owing to fishers' concerns over the fleet-wide applicability of results from discrete, highly controlled experiments associated with the development of such innovations. In New South Wales, Australia, a codend comprising a posterior section made from 35-mm square-shaped mesh (i.e. hung on the bar) was developed and subsequently recommended for partial implementation in a multi-species demersal trawl fishery (i.e. for use when eastern king prawn - Melicertus plebejus - is the primary target species). However, industry concerns over this design have to date prevented its implementation. Here, using direct twin-tow comparisons onboard a subset of the fleet, we quantitatively assessed the performance of the square-mesh codend, relative to the range of diamond-mesh codend designs currently being used, in terms of reductions in bycatch rates and shortfalls in catch rates of retained animals. Generalised linear mixed-effects modelling across all vessels showed that when eastern king prawn was the target species, the square-mesh codend significantly reduced bycatch rates (by ~48%), but with an accompanying significant shortfall in catch rates of eastern king prawn (~7%) and a substantial (though not statistically significant) shortfall in catch rates of an important component of the retained byproduct (whiting, Sillago spp., ~36%). Partitioning of data by vessel revealed that such shortfalls in retained catch were evident for only some vessels, while the square-mesh codend performed as intended for the others. When school prawn (Metapenaeus macleayi) was the target species, substantial shortfalls in catches of school prawn (~54%) in the 35-mm square-mesh codend confirmed that a codend of a smaller square mesh might be a more appropriate design under those circumstances. Potential strategies to address intra-vessel inconsistencies in performance of the square-mesh codend and thereby facilitate implementation of square-mesh codends in the fishery are discussed. © 2012.","10.1016/j.fishres.2012.07.012","CE","CE_8499",308,0.217529661570018,0.0123368051279531,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

The total mean bycatch rate was comparatively low (1114.0gha-1 from the standard diamond mesh codend), mainly because of the relatively deep waters associated with the fishery. When the TED and square mesh codend BRD were used together the total mean bycatch rate was significantly reduced by 29% (796.0gha-1) compared to the standard codend, with no significant effect on the prawn catch rate or size frequency distribution.

Eight models were considered to describe the size selective performance of the T0 and T90 codends for each species; four traditional models, along with four models that considered contact probability (the fraction of fish that will not make proper contact with the codend meshes for size-dependent escape). Fifteen hauls were completed in the North Sea, fishing both codends simultaneously. The results demonstrated that the T90 codend significantly increased size selectivity for the two roundfish species investigated, whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and pouting (Trisopterus luscus), and significantly decreased size selectivity of the three flatfish species, sole (Solea solea), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), and dab (Limanda limanda). Selection range (SR) values were similar for both roundfish species with each codend, but were significantly reduced for all flatfish species by the T90 codend. Models that considered contact probability provided the best model for four of the species with T90 (pouting, sole, plaice, and dab), and one species with T0 (sole). Lack of adequate contact with the T90 meshes could be a result of the combined effects of increased flow through the T90 codend due to T90 meshes remaining more open than T0 meshes during towing, and the relative high towing speeds of beam trawls. This study concludes that although a T90 codend reduces the size selectivity of flatfish, the lower SR of the T90 codend could be paired with a larger T90 codend mesh size for improved flatfish selectivity, and that a T90 mesh codend increases the size selectivity for commonly encountered roundfish in the Belgian beam trawl fishery.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.10.012","CE","CE_8501",298,0.11161562001358,0.161172950686348,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Generalized linear models were built for catches, discards, and landings of Nephrops and hake, controlling for the other factors which drive the variability in these variables. A dorsal square-mesh panel meant to let small hake escape did not affect hake catch, but was found to decrease Nephrops catches and discards. Among the devices intended to reduce Nephrops discards, the flexible grid was the most efficient, as it decreased catches and discards in large proportions while increasing landings but this result was supported by a small number of observations; a larger mesh size in the codend (80 mm instead of 70) slightly decreased Nephrops discards; and a ventral square-mesh panel was not found to affect catch or discards of either species.

8526,2016,"Questioning the effectiveness of technical measures implemented by the Basque bottom otter trawl fleet: Implications under the EU landing obligation","Fisheries Research","The selective properties of a bottom trawl fitted with a 70 mm diamond mesh codend and a 100 mm top square mesh panel (SMP) for hake (Merluccius merluccius), pouting (Trisopterus luscus and Trisopterus minutus) and red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) were investigated over the period 2011-2013. The experiments were carried out over three separate cruises aboard two commercial Basque bottom otter trawlers in the Bay of Biscay area. ""Fall-through"" experiments were also undertaken to estimate the potential size selection of 100 mm square mesh for the same species. Results from the ""Fall-through"" experiments and the at-sea selectivity cruises demonstrated that a 100 mm SMP has the potential to enable undersized and immature individuals to escape through the meshes. However, the selectivity cruises demonstrated that in practice, the SMP was largely ineffective at releasing undersized individuals as only a small fraction of the fish entering the trawl attempted to escape through the SMP during their drift towards the codend. The fraction attempting to escape was quantified by the ""SMP contact probability"" and was less than 4% for hake and red mullet and less than 15% for pouting. Furthermore, for each species, the release potential for the diamond mesh codend was found to be significantly lower than the length-at-maturity and the legal minimum conservation reference size. On average, the proportions of the total catch of undersized individuals of each species retained by the gear, were 52%, 17% and 45% for hake, pouting and red mullet respectively. Based on our findings, we conclude that the gear currently deployed by the Basque bottom otter trawl fleet operating in the Bay of Biscay is largely ineffective at releasing undersized hake, pouting and red mullet. The introduction of the obligation to land all catches, under the 2013 reform of the EU Common Fisheries policy will create new challenges for the Basque bottom otter trawl fleet and thereby an incentive to improve selectivity to avoid unwanted catches of undersized individuals.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.11.023","CE","CE_8526",316,0.289612799563253,0.0708758897274329,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
8527,2016,"Evaluating a large-mesh belly window to reduce bycatch in silver hake (<i>Merluccius bilinearis</i>) trawls","Fisheries Research","Small-mesh trawls targeting silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) in Northeastern USA are managed as exemptions to the northeast multispecies management plan. These exemptions require that the catch of regulated groundfish species is less than 5% of the total catch weight for small-mesh gears targeting silver hake. At present, only a raised footrope trawl (RFT) or drop-chain-only trawl (DOT) (in New England, it is specifically called ""sweepless trawl"") in conjunction with a Nordmøre-style grid can be used to land silver hake with small mesh off the coast of Maine. The historical Maine silver hake fishing grounds have a very rugged bathymetry that makes the use of these modified groundgears difficult, if not impossible. This study tested a trawl with and without a large-mesh belly window (LMBW) using a traditional rockhopper footrope for 58 tows and reduced the bycatch of red hake (Urophycis chuss) and aggregated bycatch. There was no significant difference in the predicted mean catch of silver hake between trawls (although the LMBW trawl had a 13.50% reduction). Additionally, there was no difference in catch for commercial-size silver hake (>20. cm) between the two trawls. Both video and length analysis determined that small silver hake were caught less frequently by the LMBW trawl. These results indicate that a small-mesh trawl employing a LMBW can effectively be used to commercially target silver hake off Maine (USA), replace the requirement of a RFT or DOT, and maintain the less than 5% regulated groundfish requirement.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.08.022","CE","CE_8527",244,0.0648991718375408,0.0946633932737698,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Based on the results, we were able to explain why the BACOMA codend, applied in the Baltic Sea cod directed trawl fishery, releases juvenile cod efficiently, whereas other designs, including a square mesh panel with similar mesh size, are less efficient. Our main findings reveal that the release efficiency of the square mesh panel in the BACOMA codend depends largely on the overlap of the square mesh panel and the catch-accumulation zone in the codend, where cod do not have the option of just drifting further back in the trawl when proximate to the panel. On the contrary, the reduction in panel size by 50% did not significantly affect the release efficiency when the panel overlapped with the catch-accumulation zone. It was possible to stimulate an escape response for cod to achieve a release through a square mesh panel positioned away from the catch-accumulation zone. Our findings demonstrated that this release was as efficient as for a panel mounted in the catch-accumulation zone of the codend. Devices that stimulate behaviour may improve the release efficiency of cod through square mesh panels in other fisheries where this is a problem.","10.1093/icesjms/fsu124","CE","CE_8532",250,0.171051332374651,0.181741072679923,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

We introduce and assess the performance of FRESWIND (Flatfish Rigid EScape WINDows), a concept for a selection device that reduces flatfish bycatch in roundfish-directed fisheries. The new concept was tested for the first time in the Baltic cod-directed fishery, using a commercial twin trawler. The vessel was rigged with two trawls; one standard trawl gear and one incorporating the experimental FRESWIND. Comparison of the catches from both trawls exhibited up to ~68% reduction in flatfish bycatch for the trawl with FRESWIND mounted. In addition, the catch of undersized cod was reduced by ~30%, whereas losses of marketable cod were relatively minor (~7%). Further simulations predicted that, in the commercial fishery, a reduction of more than 50% in flatfish bycatch could be achieved if FRESWIND were adopted. Given these promising results, FRESWIND may also provide a method that significantly reduces flatfish bycatch in other fisheries.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.08.025","CE","CE_8534",163,0.296990340232482,0.00460021454162294,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
8543,2011,"Effects of Turtle Excluder Devices on bycatch and discard reduction in the demersal fisheries of Mediterranean Sea","Aquatic Living Resources","The Central Mediterranean provides important neritic habitats for loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), but Mediterranean bottom trawlers catch an estimated 30 000 turtles a year, with 25% mortality. Mortality by trawling is mainly due to enforced apnoea during towing activity. In order to reduce the submergence time and consequent turtle mortality, a specific technical modification was developed in the early 1980s: the Turtle Excluder Device (TED). In this paper, we field-tested a typical Supershooter TED and three new types of low-cost TED, built with different designs and materials, incorporating aspects of US and Australian TEDs, as well as design features to improve handling and catch rates. The performance of the TEDs was investigated under commercial fishing conditions in diverse trawling grounds in the Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean). All TEDs were easy to operate and did not require changes to normal fishing operations. Due to lack of entry of turtles it was not possible to evaluate the ability of the different TEDs to release turtles, but one large loggerhead turtle (C. caretta) was captured during the experimental tows and was successfully excluded by the Supershooter. The TEDs reduced anthropogenic debris and, consequently, sorting operations on board. Among the four TEDs tested, both the semi-rigid TED and the Supershooter performed in accordance with the design objectives: total discards were reduced but total commercial catches were not significantly reduced. With the Supershooter, all European hake (Merluccius merluccius) individuals equal to or above 16 cm were found in the codend and 10-15% of those between 5.0 and 15.5 cm were released. In general, the total discard rate of the TED-equipped nets was reduced to around 20-60%. Since the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1967/2006 called for a discard reduction policy in waters under the jurisdiction of the European Union, TEDs may have some broader value in this context. © EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD 2011.","10.1051/alr/2011109","CE","CE_8543",300,0.195964187473019,0.045955406253905,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Experimental fishing with the grid demonstrated the possibility to capture Norway pout with only a minimum of unintended bycatch. Fishing with two different grid orientations, backwards and forwards-leaning, in distinct day and night hauls, resulted in an estimated release of between 88.4 and 100% of the total number of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) entering the trawl. However, bycatch reductions were not significantly different between day and night or between grid orientations, indicating that the grid rejection of haddock and whiting is not influenced by fish behaviour. The loss of the target species, Norway pout, was low (between 5.6% and 13.7%) in comparison with the bycatch excluded, and clearly length dependent. Consequently, loss of target species would vary with the size structure of the population fished. Although results were not statistically significant, length-based analyses indicated that the grid rejection likelihood for particularly smaller Norway pout (<16 cm) was higher when fishing with the forwards-leaning grid during the night; this might be explained by behavioural and visual aspects of the fish-grid encounter process for Norway pout. © EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD 2011.","10.1051/alr/2011152","CE","CE_8545",210,0.121531814512453,-0.13835254149642,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

For many fishermen targeting flatfishes in this fishery, catches of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) can be a concern because quota is limited relative to flatfish quotas. Thus, approaches to minimize bycatch of limiting species are important to the economic viability of the fishery.

The aim of the present study is to broaden the horizon for size selectivity in trawl gears by demonstrating the feasibility of alternative selectivity patterns for trawls. As a case study, we combined two well-known selection devices to obtain a bell-shaped selectivity curve in trawls with low catch ability of both small and large individuals from the target species.

Georgia is one of few US states without a directed commercial shark fishery, but the state has a large, nearshore penaeid shrimp trawl fishery in which small sharks occur as bycatch. During our 1995-1998 investigation of bycatch in fishery-dependent sampling events, 34% of 127 trawls contained sharks. This bycatch totalled 217 individuals from six species, with Atlantic sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae (Richardson), the most common and finetooth shark, Carcharhinus isodon (Müller & Henle) and spinner shark, Carcharhinus brevipinna (Müller & Henle), the least common. The highest catch rates for sharks occurred during June and July and coincided with the peak months of the pupping season for many species. Trawl tow speed and tow time did not significantly influence catch rates for shark species. Gear configurations [net type, turtle excluder device (TED), bycatch reduction device] affected catch rates for shark species.

During experiment 2, the bar spaces were subsequently maintained, but the grid area was increased by 1.4 while the extension section mesh size was reduced by 1.3, and the impacts of different materials (hollow vs. solid aluminium rod), bar diameter (10 vs. 16mm) and presence/absence of a guiding panel were investigated.

But, unlike the small grid, none of the large grids significantly reduced the catches of teleosts. This result was attributed to the increased distance required by fish smaller than the bar spaces to swim out of the escape exit.

We used a structural model to estimate the contribution of the individual selective processes consisting of the excluder grid and the size selective codend. The 90. mm excluder grid did not prove to be efficient in excluding G. melastomus, while it excuded more of P. blennoides. Catches of N. norvegicus were also affected by the presence of the grid, but not as much as the catches of other two species. The results obtained for the experimental grid. +. codend setup were then compared with the estimated selectivity for the ""codend alone"" setup.

Three species of valuable fish - Scomberomorus commerson, Otolithes ruber, and Pampus argenteus were selected for selectivity analysis. For each of the three commercial fish studied, less individuals smaller than the minimum landing size (MLS) were retained in the experimental codends of both BRDs. The average exclusion rate of individuals smaller than MLS was calculated to be 47% and 32% for Nafted plus fisheye and Nordmore grid respectively.

Selective fishing gear, such as bycatch-reduction devices (BRDs), can significantly decrease bycatch and discards in shrimp trawl fisheries. The roller-frame trawl, a type of gear unique to Florida, is used in seagrass beds to harvest food shrimp and bait shrimp. No BRD is required for roller-frame trawls, although bycatch can be significant. We tested the effectiveness of two BRDs - the Florida fisheye (FFE) and the large-mesh extended-mesh funnel (EMF) - in reducing bycatch in roller-frame trawls. Tests were conducted at two Florida locations: the nearshore waters off Tarpon Springs, where food shrimp are harvested, and Biscayne Bay, where bait shrimp are harvested. At Tarpon Springs, each device was tested independently and with the addition of a stimulator cone; the cone was not tested at Biscayne Bay. We tested each BRD configuration using a paired trawl design; a BRD-equipped net was deployed off one side of the boat, and a control net with no BRD was deployed off the other side of the boat. The effectiveness of the BRD configurations in retaining shrimp while reducing bycatch varied considerably. Although some significant species-specific reductions were observed in the FFE, that BRD did not significantly reduce overall finfish bycatch, but it did retain shrimp. The EMF performed well, but only at Tarpon Springs. Bycatch reduction was significant, albeit low, and shrimp loss was low. At Biscayne Bay, both bycatch and shrimp loss were significantly reduced in the EMF. Use of the stimulator cone with the FFE and the EMF resulted in significant bycatch reduction but also significant shrimp loss.

Depending upon configuration, trawls with an NCBRD captured about 46-100% of shrimp taken in controls, reduced total bycatch by 26-60% and, of particular note, reduced red snapper bycatch by about 50%. When catch rates were compared, 2.29 (±0.38 s.e.)snapper/h/trawl were taken with an NCBRD and 6.11 (±0.93 s.e.)snapper/h/trawl without, a highly significant (ANOVA, P=0.0032, F=9.39, d.f.=1, 64) effect. Finally, using only red snapper captured in control trawls, we observed a significant effect of depth on red snapper capture with decreasing numbers of red snapper captured with increasing depth. In waters south of Galveston shallower than about 55m, catch rates ranged from 4.5 to 23.4snapper/h/trawl and in deeper water ranged from 0.3 to 2.4snapper/h/trawl. We identified a highly significant relationship (P<0.001, R2=0.685) between red snapper catch and depth. We estimate that use of the NCBRD would reduce juvenile red snapper bycatch in the northern Gulf of Mexico by about 50%. These results suggest that the NCBRD may find application in trawl fisheries worldwide.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.02.009","CE","CE_8588",290,0.139175266476874,-0.037302777461909,"300","neutral","neutral_300",1
8590,2016,"Ray bycatch in a tropical shrimp fishery: do bycatch reduction devices and turtle excluder devices effectively exclude rays?","Fisheries Research","Worldwide, many species of elasmobranchs (Chondrichthyes: Elasmobranchii) are currently threatened by marine fisheries activity and are on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Although Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) for teleost fish and Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) are now widespread in tropical shrimp trawling, information on their ability to mitigate bycatch of elasmobranchs, particularly rays (Batoidea), is scarce and limited to only a few isolated fisheries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of trawls fitted with a square-mesh panel BRD and super-shooter TED in reducing ray bycatch. In this study, 65 catch-comparison hauls were conducted in the Atlantic seabob shrimp (. Xiphopenaeus kroyeri) fishery off Suriname. Trawls with a BRD and TED combination reduced ray catch rate by 36%. A 21% reduction in mean size indicated the preferential exclusion of large rays. Hence, high escape ratios were observed for Dasyatis geijskesi (77%), a large-sized species, while exclusion of the small species Urotrygon microphthalmum was not significant, although their disc width is small enough to pass through the meshes of the BRD. Furthermore, a size-dependent escape for the two most abundant mid-sized ray species Dasyatis guttata and Gymnura micrura was observed. Exclusion-at-size differed for both species, however, likely related to species-specific morphology or behavior in response to the TED. This study shows that the combination of BRD and TED causes an important reduction in ray bycatch in seabob shrimp fisheries off Suriname. The great reduction in catch of large-sized rays is positive, but the mortality of juvenile rays is likely to have negative consequences for their populations. We therefore recommend gear-based and non-gear adaptations to further reduce the bycatch of small-sized rays.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.11.009","CE","CE_8590",288,0.256093794018025,-0.0234309227356109,"300","neutral","neutral_300",1
8595,2011,"Rope Grid: a new grid design to further reduce fin fish bycatch in the Gulf of Maine pink shrimp fishery","Fisheries Research","The pink shrimp (Pandalus borealis) is an important commercial species for the Gulf of Maine inshore fleet with annual landings exceeding 5500 metric tons in 2010. Due to the small codend meshes used in the trawl, bycatch of juvenile finfish has been an issue. The adoption of the Nordmøre Grid since the early 1990s has significantly reduced finfish bycatch in the fishery, but a small portion of juvenile fish continues to be caught and discarded. To further reduce finfish bycatch, flume tank tests and sea trials were carried out on a radically modified Nordmøre-style grid. The new design cut away two-thirds of the netting surrounding a traditional Nordmøre Grid, and replaced the netting with four ropes, hence called "" Rope Grid"" A trouser trawl with two identical codends was used for sea trials on board F/V "" North Star"" , a 14m shrimp trawler, comparing the codend equipped with the new Rope Grid to the codend with a regular Nordmøre Grid. Four major bycatch species with mean catch rates greater than 0.4kgh-1 were silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis), red hake (Urophycis chuss), American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) and witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus). The results indicate that the new Rope Grid significantly reduced all four major bycatch species by 36-50% (P 0.1) or the size of the shrimp (number of shrimps in 1kg, RNG: 109.3±1.96; ROPE: 110.0±1.70; P=0.62). The reduction of finfish bycatch was length related for all four major species with an increased rate of escape for larger fish from the Rope Grid. The Rope Grid was practical to handle and easy to modify, and has potential for adoption in this fishery as well as possible application in other shrimp and prawn fisheries around the world. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2011.07.001","CE","CE_8595",281,0.291745865671963,0.077495607259243,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

However, the Nordmøre Grid does not reduce the catch of small shrimps. To reduce catch of small shrimps, a size-sorting grid with 11. mm grid spacing was developed and has been used by some trawlers. However, we do not know if the 11. mm spacing is the optimal spacing for the fishery. We thus compared two sizes of grid spacing: 9 and 11. mm. A trouser trawl system was developed and used to compare a codend with a 9. mm spacing size-sorting grid and another identical codend with an 11. mm spacing size-sorting grid. No significant differences were observed in the catch rate of shrimp, or major bycatch species between the two grids (p=0.35). The 11. mm grid caught slightly less shrimps between 18 and 22. mm carapace lengths that correspond to carapace widths of 8.5-10.5. mm. This indicates that shrimps with 8.5-10.5. mm carapace width might have escaped through the 11. mm grid, but not the 9. mm grid.

8597,2013,"A new shrimp trawl combination grid system that reduces small shrimp and finfish bycatch","Fisheries Research","The Nordmøre Grid developed more than twenty years ago has significantly reduced finfish bycatch in the northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) fishery in Europe and North America. However, the grid does not reduce the catch of small shrimp and juvenile fish that are able to pass through the spaces between grid bars. A comprehensive project was initiated to reduce finfish discards and small shrimp in the Gulf of Maine northern shrimp fishery. The project designed, tested, and optimized a size-sorting grid (He and Balzano, 2012a,b) and a radically modified Nordmøre-style grid (the Rope Grid, He and Balzano, 2011). These previous papers reported the results of the separate designs (either size-sorting grid or the Rope Grid). This paper reports performance of a combination grid in a shrimp trawl consisting of a 9. mm spacing size-sorting grid and a Rope Grid. The combination grid (9Rope) reduced both small shrimp and finfish bycatch when compared to a regular Nordmøre Grid (RNG). The new combination grid reduced finfish bycatch by 33%, with a small reduction of targeted shrimp catch (12%). The finfish reduction was length-related for three of the above four species with greater reductions for larger individuals. The combination grid is practical to handle and has potential for commercial use in the northern shrimp fishery in Gulf of Maine and other regions where similar target and bycatch species are mixed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2012.11.009","CE","CE_8597",231,0.0896591290152131,0.0847442392748819,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

We found that not all redfish make physical contact with the spacing between the bars in the sorting grids while they pass in the direction of the codend, and therefore the escapement of some undersized redfish depends on size selection in the codend. We estimate that most of the escapement in the combined selection system (consisting of a 55-mm grid and a diamond mesh codend) happens through the grid. We demonstrated that for one of the two grid systems investigated the increase in size selection obtained experimentally by increasing grid-bar spacing is well in line with what could be expected based on the morphology of redfish. However, the size selection observed experimentally was significantly lower than the size-selective potential of the grids estimated based on the morphology of redfish. By computer simulations, we show that a possible explanation for this difference could be that not all redfish that attempt to escape through the grid make their attempt with an optimal angle of attack. © EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD 2013.","10.1051/alr/2013051","CE","CE_8598",202,0.188258005802563,0.0789305848934834,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

When compared, the historical codend size selectivity data fitted well with the selectivity predictions from the FISHSELECT analyses. The historical grid selectivity data and the results from the two sea trials showed considerably lower L50 values than what would be expected from the morphological-based limit estimated by FISHSELECT. The size selectivity results obtained from the analysis of the two sea trials differed significantly, even though they were conducted using grid sections with similar bar spacing that previously were shown to have similar selective properties for other species. The differences were not caused by differences in the ability of the fish to contact the grid. Instead, these differences can be explained by differences in the ability of the fish to turn before they attack the grid. In earlier grid selectivity studies, the influence of angle of attack ( ) was not quantified. We show that the ability to contact the grid with a more or less optimal differs between individuals. This is important to consider in grid selectivity studies for flatfish species such as Greenland halibut because it can potentially influence results considerably and therefore can be a source of variability in results between cruises. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2013.04.004","CE","CE_8599",242,0.23677291451532,0.182102412498235,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

We tested its ability to size select and release typical bycatch species in the cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinnus) directed fishery, i.e. two species of redfish (Sebastes spp.). The redfish selectivity data were analysed using a new model that included direct quantification of the probability that fish will make contact with the grids. The results showed that the proportion of redfish escaping through the two grids did not differ significantly. The release efficiency of the first (lower) grid was, however predicted to be significantly lower than that of the second grid when accounting for the actual fraction of redfish reaching the zones of the individual grids. An estimated 80% of the redfish made contact with at least one of the two grids. However, the release efficiency and overall size selection for redfish of the new double grid system was not significantly better than obtained in former selectivity trials testing the grid systems used in the fishery today. Moreover, this comparison of results showed that the existing Sort-V single grid system releases significantly more redfish than the new double grid system.","10.1016/j.fishres.2016.07.013","CE","CE_8600",221,0.174086784013782,0.254613166904318,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Traditionally the flexigrid is mounted in a two-panel extension section of a trawl just ahead of the codend, but this design has performance limitations, especially during high volume catch situations. The aim of this study was to investigate the size selective properties of a new four-panel section design for the flexigrid and compare them to those of the traditional two-panel section. Specifically, we wanted to determine if this new design would increase the probability for undersized fish to make contact with the grid and subsequently escape through at least one of the two grids in the section. We quantified the parameter grid contact for both grids independently and combined for both the mandatory two-panel and the new four-panel designs. We directly compared the two designs using a single trawl with a three compartment experimental design which enabled estimation of the contribution of each of the grids to the combined selectivity of the flexigrid section. The results based on 51 hauls with 108,518 cod and haddock length measurements indicate that the four-panel flexigrid design was better able to release undersized fish than the two-panel design. While the mean values of grid contact estimated for both grid designs were similar, the four-panel section had lower risk of clogging in situations of high fish entry rates. Underwater video recordings revealed that the cause for this difference between designs may be related to the difference in shape of the two sections while fishing. The results showed that undersized cod escape mostly through the lower grid of the flexigrid section, whereas haddock generally utilize the upper grid. This finding is in good agreement with the behavioral differences previously described for these two species. Due to the favourable results obtained from this study, the four-panel flexigrid section is now legalized in the Northeast Arctic cod and haddock fishery.","10.1016/j.fishres.2016.06.022","CE","CE_8601",338,0.180904597200148,0.143610915412433,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

There are few, if any, studies that have determined mitigation performances of BRDs from subsurface interactions for these species, as most are rarely encountered and thus require substantial levels of observer coverage for robust assessments. This study combined in-net and onboard (774 day trawls and 1320 day trawl hours of subsurface observer coverage) electronic monitoring on all fish-trawl vessels (n = 3) to compare bycatch mitigation performances among nine megafauna groups, based on escape rates and interaction durations for three BRDs over 6 months (June to December 2012). Overall, 26.9% of day trawls had no megafauna interactions and 38.3% of the 1826 interactions escaped, with most in rapid time (91.4% in = 5 min). The upward inclined exclusion grid significantly improved the escape proportions for most chondrichthyans by 20-30%. All BRDs were highly effective in reducing reptile (turtles and seasnakes) bycatch, but irrelevant for the few sawfish (n = 13) that readily entangled in the anterior of the net. Cetacean (bottlenose dolphins only) interactions with BRDs were very rare (n = 7) despite high levels of attendance and depredation during trawling. Loss of targeted teleosts through the BRD hatch was rare (1.3% of day trawls). This relatively cost-effective method of electronic monitoring achieved very high levels of subsurface observer coverage (60% of day trawls or 56% of day trawl hours), and provided evidence that the subsurface expulsion of megafauna in poor condition is negligible. Furthermore, this study provides species-specific improvements toward bycatch mitigation strategies for demersal fish trawling.","10.1093/icesjms/fsw143","CE","CE_8602",266,0.185935895628143,0.122223069014803,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

The results demonstrated that the release grid improved the escape of the smallest Deep-water Shrimp significantly. The fraction of small shrimp released through this grid was estimated to be 45%. However, the results also revealed the need for further improvements in the design of the release grid to increase the reduction of small shrimp and juvenile fish bycatch.

Our objective was to investigate the effects of post-fire landscape conditions on the occurrence of foraging bats in mixed forests of the Cumberland Plateau physiographic region. We deployed Anabat II bat detectors in 164 paired burned and unburned forest sites for =2 nights from mid-May through August 2014 and 2015 to monitor bat foraging and commuting habitat use. We conducted vegetation surveys to quantify site-specific structural characteristics, which indicated that measures of structure were significantly lower in burned sites than unburned sites. We used Program Presence to test a priori hypotheses of species-specific probability of detection and site occupancy related to weather, burn history (i.e., site burned within the past 10 years or unburned), and site and landscape characteristics. Bats were detected at 94% of burned sites and 83% of unburned sites. Probability of detection was affected by weather conditions, vegetative structure, and burn history for most species. Occupancy for all species/species groups examined was positively associated with burning and generally associated with lower vegetative structure. Although burn severity did not affect most species groups, occupancy of Myotis species and tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) was lower in sites that received moderate severity burns than in sites that received low severity burns. Therefore, while prescribed fire may provide vegetative structure conducive to efficient foraging for all bats of the Cumberland Plateau, our results demonstrate that retaining some unburned forests while creating mosaics of lower and higher severity burns across the landscape will result in favorable foraging conditions for all resident bat species.","10.1016/j.foreco.2019.05.024","CE","CE_8605",284,0.158291784140159,0.0167920292935407,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8606,2019,"Bat overpasses: An insufficient solution to restore habitat connectivity across roads","Journal of Applied Ecology","Roads have many negative effects on wildlife, including their role in habitat fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation affects bats during their daily movements between roosts and foraging areas. As bats are protected in Europe, developers must implement specific mitigation measures that are hierarchically structured to achieve a null net impact. However, very few specific mitigation measures have been undertaken specifically for bats. Bat overpasses (e.g. gantries) are among proposed improvements intended to reduce the impact of roads, but they have rarely been tested. The effectiveness of overpasses in facilitating safe road crossing of bats is critical for justifying the implementation of this mitigation measure. We therefore assessed whether bat overpasses are effectively used by bats. We studied three bat overpasses with different designs in France. We developed an innovative method to characterize bat crossings using acoustic flight path reconstruction (AFPR). We used six pairs of stereo acoustic recorders in different habitat types that were located on both sides of the road, and operated simultaneously throughout the night. Recording data contained 57,941 bat passes and 284 bat crossings from six species of bats at the three study sites. Our results suggest that crossings are more numerous if an overpass is located where bat commuting routes have been identified by environmental impact assessment. However, we found that the proportion of bat crossings along the commuting route was the same with or without an overpass; thus highlighting that bat overpasses do not fully restore habitat connectivity. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that acoustic flight path reconstruction (AFPR) is a useful approach to obtain information on bat flight behaviour. We also emphasize the importance of field testing the effectiveness of mitigation measures, such as those intended to offset the impact of roads on biodiversity, and highlight that such measures should not be implemented based on their theoretical effectiveness alone.","10.1111/1365-2664.13288","CE","CE_8606",303,0.123491030779151,0.122300542947299,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Bats are an ecologically significant group within North American forests, and the diversity of this group includes species that may benefit or suffer negative impacts from habitat changes initiated by prescribed fires. To determine how fire affects a rare bat species that specializes on gleaning moths from forest vegetation, we studied home ranges and nocturnal habitat selection in Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) in an upland forest ecosystem where small-scale, low-to-moderate intensity prescribed burning occurs in spring. We found home ranges of big-eared bats to be notably small (x = 169 ha; n = 41), not different in size among sexes and reproductive classes, and located nonrandomly on the landscape. Home ranges of females were located farthest from riparian areas, whereas home ranges of males were farthest from burned forests. Home ranges of lactating and postlactating females were closer to burned forests than expected, but no group of females had home ranges located closer to or farther from burned forests relative to unburned forests. All groups used habitats randomly within home ranges. Moth abundance and diversity (number of families) were lowest in riparian habitats, indicating that habitat selection by female bats at the landscape, but not home range, scale was influenced by prey availability. Results indicate that low-to-moderate intensity prescribed fires weakly affected the foraging patterns of Rafinesque's big-eared bats in upland forest ecosystems, provided burned forests exist in a matrix of unburned or less-frequently burned forest stands that support a diverse and abundant lepidopteran prey base.","10.1093/jmammal/gyz039","CE","CE_8608",273,0.146239220677147,0.00286887888697416,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8610,2019,"Long-term effects of repeated fuel-reduction burning and logging on bats in south-eastern Australia","Austral Ecology","Fire regimes have a major influence on biodiversity in many ecosystems around the globe, yet our understanding of the longer-term response of fauna is typically poor. We sampled bats with ultrasonic detectors in three different years in dry sclerophyll forests of south-eastern Australia in a long-term, management-scale experiment. Frequent low-intensity burning (every 2 or 4 years plus unburnt) and logging (with 33% retention of the original unlogged tree basal area) were manipulated to assess their effects on bats. We found that both the fire regime and regrowth after logging influenced the local bat community. The routine burning treatment (burnt every 4 years) in unlogged forest was consistently related to higher total bat activity (23 times) and species richness when compared to unburnt controls and logging treatments. Foraging activity was more variable, but it was typically lowest in Unlogged Unburnt Controls. These patterns were evident at both the detector site scale and the block scale and were probably due to a reduction in understorey stem density with burning, especially in unlogged forest. Bat activity was significantly lower across the entire study area (including controls) in 1 year, when sampling occurred within 6 months of burning. When pooled across burning treatments, unlogged forest supported higher bat activity (1.5 times) and species richness than logged forest (12- to 17-year-old regrowth), again most likely because of a negative association with high stem density in regrowth after logging. We conclude that low-intensity burning had positive benefits for echolocating bats, most notably in unlogged forest. However, careful planning is required to generate heterogeneous vegetation patterns that are likely to be most suitable for a range of taxa.","10.1111/aec.12768","CE","CE_8610",269,0.265194739931282,0.0727525361623471,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

The deterrent system consisted of air-jet ultrasonic emitters mounted on nacelles and towers in a different configuration each year. Each year we conducted a randomized block experiment to determine whether the acoustic deterrent reduced bat mortalities at the wind farm. Effectiveness was based on estimates of bat mortalities during 3-day trials. The operation of the acoustic deterrent resulted in significant overall bat fatality reductions of 29.2% ((Formula presented.) = 7.5%) and 32.5% ((Formula presented.) = 6.8%) in 2014 and 2015, respectively. All-bat fatality rates were not reduced in 2016; however, annual all-bat effectiveness estimates were influenced by species composition.

8612,2019,"Effects of artificial illumination on drinking bats: a field test in forest and desert habitats","Animal Conservation","Bats show pronounced and often-adverse reactions to artificial illumination at night (ALAN) when commuting, roosting or foraging. ALAN also affects bat drinking activity, at least when lighting occurs over short intervals. We tested whether continuous illumination of drinking sites over 4-h periods would lead bats to tolerate ALAN and resume drinking in the course of the night. We conducted our experiments in forest (Italy) and desert (Israel) sites to test whether in the latter habitat, where water is scarce, a greater motivation to drink might lead to less adverse bat reactions. We recorded 6853 drinking buzzes and 1647 feeding buzzes from 17 species and one species group. In the forest sites, species that hunt in open spaces or along forest edges showed little (P. pipistrellus and H. savii) or no (P. kuhlii and N. leisleri) drinking activity decrease, while those associated with forest interiors (Barbastella barbastellus, Plecotus auritus and bats in the genus Myotis) exhibited a strong negative response. In the desert sites, all studied species reduced drinking activity, yet in the desert populations of P. kuhlii we recorded stronger adverse reactions only far from human settlements. The harsh reactions that the desert bat species showed towards ALAN rule out any effect of a greater motivation to drink. Illumination had no effect on foraging by most species, except in the forest sites, where Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri increased foraging when the light was on, and in the desert sites, where Hypsugo bodenheimeri decreased foraging in such situations. The progressive human encroachment that is taking place in many world regions on both forests and especially deserts, where few sites for drinking are available, may jeopardize bat populations also through increased exposure to ALAN.","10.1111/acv.12443","CE","CE_8612",281,0.0706073311447626,-0.0238920635148742,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

8614,2019,"Quantifying the damage caused by fruit bats to backyard lychee trees in Mauritius and evaluating the benefits of protective netting","PLoS ONE","The Mauritius fruit bat (Pteropus niger) has been the subject of repeated culling campaigns, apparently in response to pressure from the fruit-growing industry concerned over damage to commercially valuable orchard crops such as lychees. More than 31,000 fruit-bearing lychee trees also exist in private backyards, making this an issue pertinent to a wide cross-section of the Mauritian general public and not just those involved in commercial fruit production. The level of damage caused by bats to fruit crops is often debated and the low number of robust damage assessment studies hampers mitigation efforts. During the fruiting season of 2016/2017, we assessed the damage among backyard lychee trees attributable to fruit bats and other causes around Vacoas-Phoenix, Central Mauritius and evaluated the impact of using protective netting as a mitigation strategy. Fruit yield from panicles that were protected from depredation by nylon netting was approximately one third greater than that from unprotected panicles. We suspect that fruit bats were responsible for approximately 42% of the total damage but illustrate the difficulties in attributing damage to a single cause in such assessments. Although we demonstrate the value of protective netting, we recognize that barriers to implementation exist and that a more holistic approach that incorporates crop protection, forest restoration strategies and addresses negative public attitudes towards bats in general is required to ensure the persistence of this endemic species.","10.1371/journal.pone.0220955","CE","CE_8614",228,0.184935940373583,-0.0171475357236787,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8615,2012,"The effect of tourist visits on the behavior of <i>Rousettus madagascariensis</i> (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) in the caves of Ankarana, northern Madagascar","Acta Chiropterologica","Disturbance by tourists of bats in their day roosts represents a potential threat to the conservation of these mammals. We assessed the effect of experimental tourist visits on behavior of the Malagasy endemic Rousettus madagascariensis (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) in the Ankarana National Park, northern Madagascar. We measured bat behavior, including time activity budgets, under two levels of experimental human visit proximity (far and near) and illumination (low and high). These visits caused an increase in bat flights and an increase in alertness in a frequently-visited colony with faint ambient daylight. The greatest response occurred for human approaches to 5-6 m that directly illuminated the bats and the least response occurred for approaches to 12-14 m that did not directly illuminate the bats. In an infrequently-visited colony with no ambient daylight, visits that remained 12-14 m away and did not illuminate the bats directly caused an increase in alert behavior and a decrease in bat grooming behavior. The difference in response between the colonies suggests that R. madagascariensis may demonstrate an attenuated response to some frequent human visits. Alternatively, colonies roosting with some ambient light may be less sensitive to disturbance from visits, and colonies with previous experience primarily with hunting visits may be more responsive to disturbance. Maintaining a minimum visit distance of 12 m and not illuminating the bats directly, as well as not opening other roost sites to tourism, is likely to help to limit disturbance of R. madagascariensis by tourists at Ankarana. © Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.","10.3161/150811012X661783","CE","CE_8615",248,0.21833056882562,-0.0565725681286489,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8616,2019,"Field trial of a probiotic bacteria to protect bats from white-nose syndrome","Scientific Reports","Tools for reducing wildlife disease impacts are needed to conserve biodiversity. White-nose syndrome (WNS), caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, has caused widespread declines in North American bat populations and threatens several species with extinction. Few tools exist for managers to reduce WNS impacts. We tested the efficacy of a probiotic bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, to reduce impacts of WNS in two simultaneous experiments with caged and free-flying Myotis lucifugus bats at a mine in Wisconsin, USA. In the cage experiment there was no difference in survival between control and P. fluorescens-treated bats. However, body mass, not infection intensity, predicted mortality, suggesting that within-cage disturbance influenced the cage experiment. In the free-flying experiment, where bats were able to avoid conspecific disturbance, infection intensity predicted the date of emergence from the mine. In this experiment treatment with P. fluorescens increased apparent overwinter survival five-fold compared to the control group (from 8.4% to 46.2%) by delaying emergence of bats from the site by approximately 32 days. These results suggest that treatment of bats with P. fluorescens may substantially reduce WNS mortality, and, if used in combination with other interventions, could stop population declines.","10.1038/s41598-019-45453-z","CE","CE_8616",193,0.180377472151683,-0.180580264247715,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
8618,2015,"Escape response of juvenile fish in a shaking codend determined from tank experiments","Fisheries Research","A new method to increase escape rate of juvenile fish from trawl codend was developed. The method encourages fish to approach the netting by generating an active shaking motion using a cap-like canvas at the end of the codend. Three types of model codend were used: a traditional codend, a fluttering flag-like netting panel and a double conical rope array used as an active stimulating device (ASD). The escape responses of juvenile bastard halibut (Paralichthys olivaceus) and juvenile red seabream (Pagrus major) were observed in a circulating water channel. The amplitude ratio of the shaking distance was 0.6-0.8 of the codend diameter and its period was 3-4. s. The escape rate was 22-30% higher in the shaking codends than in steady codends. The relative lateral moving speeds of the escaping fish were 1.4-1.7 times higher when shaking occurred than when no shaking occurred. The sieving effect of the shaking codend operated to actively drive fish to the netting panels and weakened the optomotor response of fish, possibly by generating erratic movement, allowing more fish to escape, and resulting in a reduction of the juvenile by-catch.","10.1016/j.fishres.2014.08.012","CE","CE_8618",184,0.243816638721591,0.0496594835368297,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Two large-scale bubble rafts, a 21m2 and a flexible 75m2 bubble raft with tow-parallel and tow-perpendicular sparger elements, respectively, were tested in the sea with high Calanus densities in the upper 25m. Bubble-driven upwelling velocities (Vup) measured with different air flows (Q) and source depths (z0), gave Vup~Q0.27 with stratified water, and were in agreement with other results for stratified conditions. Bubble trawls significantly enhanced Calanus concentrations in the upper water column: up to 1416%, with the best results for the transverse sparger raft, which also was tested with weak stratification. Bubble trawl performance also was affected by the stratification, with the highest enhancement for the lowest stratification. Catch species analysis showed reduced bycatch.

We use generalised linear models (GLMs) to analyse historical mesh net and drumline catches (1996-2006) of Sphyrna lewini from the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP), which covers 10 locations on the north-east coast of Australia. Results show a significant decline in S. lewini female total length over the study period and a significant increase in annual CPUE on the Gold Coast. Sexual segregation was found in Cairns, where S. lewini males were most abundant. A positive linear relationship was found between maternal total length and litter size. Birth-size embryos were found in most months. However, normal birth size (0.50. m) embryos were found in pregnant females most often during spring and summer. Mesh nets were more selective for smaller S. lewini than drumlines. It is recognised that species selectivity of other, more potentially dangerous shark species varies between gear types, but replacement of mesh nets with drumlines would reduce the catch of smaller individuals of S. lewini and assist in their conservation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2011.06.005","CE","CE_8627",185,0.190124972483494,0.225427598498379,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
8628,2012,"Assessing the fish assemblage associated with FADs (Fish Aggregating Devices) in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea using two different professional fishing gears","Fisheries Research","Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) are used worldwide by fishermen to improve fishery yields, based on the finding that juveniles and adults of both pelagic and demersal fish species are attracted to floating objects. FADs fisheries are usually exploited using purse seine nets. In Sicilian seas, two different purse seines are used: (a) classic purse seine and (b) a transformed beach seine known as raustina. In this study we compared these two fishing gears in order to determine the best one for assessing fish diversity and to evaluate their impact on the species caught. We sampled the fishes associated with FADs from July to November 2003. Each haul was monitored by a SCUBA diver who observed the species escaping from the different types of net. Results showed that both gears catch the same fish species but significant differences in abundance were detected between gears. In particular, the purse seine caught a higher number of Thunnus thynnus than the beach seine (respectively: 8.2 ± 1.1 vs 0.9 ± 0.2), which in turn proved more efficient in catching C. crysos (31.4 ± 3.7 vs 8.9 ± 1.5 caught by purse seine). SCUBA observations revealed that T. thynnus escapes capture more easily from the beach seine than from the purse seine, due to their behaviour of swimming at a depth beneath that reached by the beach seine. On the other hand, the smallest specimens of C. crysos pass more easily through purse seine mesh, which is larger than beach seine mesh. Both gears are equally useful for assessing biodiversity associated with FADs, although they give different results for fish abundance. As the catches of FADs fishery target species (i.e. Coryphaena hippurus) were similar for the two gears, the modified beach seine could be proposed as a management tool to reduce the catches of young T. thynnus in accordance with European legislation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2011.11.020","CE","CE_8628",298,0.262014223090787,0.135768827564979,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Therefore, re-evaluations of current practice are important as a basis for management actions. The Swedish fishery for Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) in the Kattegat-Skagerrak area provides an interesting case study of relevance to emerging policies. Sprung from an unbalance in available fish- and Nephrops quotas and an ambition to protect coastal areas, the current fishery has been directed towards three separate fisheries (mixed trawling, directed trawling using a sorting grid and creeling). Studying direct and indirect effects from alternative Swedish quota allocations among gear types is therefore interesting. Accordingly, a screening study was conducted, taking into consideration area-gear interactions in catch rates, to compare the three different fisheries regarding quantified pressures on the target species, the by-catch species, and on the seafloor, as well as to qualitatively discuss social and economic dimensions. In the next step, alternative quota allocations were studied. In Swedish fisheries, we show that creeling offers a substantial reduction of fishing mortality of both undersized Nephrops and fish and a reduced seafloor pressure per landed kilo of Nephrops. Given that the fishing areas in many cases may be interchangeable between gears, allocating a larger quota share to creels in the Swedish fishery would therefore contribute to the integration of fisheries- and environmental management as called for in the new policies.","10.1093/icesjms/fsw153","CE","CE_8629",257,0.201186355646142,0.209285640227592,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8647,2011,"Effects of the presence of official-looking volunteers on harassment of New Zealand fur seals","Conservation Biology","An increased number of tourists viewing animals in the wild have increased stress on these animals (hereafter wildlife). Many wildlife-viewing locations rely on voluntary compliance with posted regulations to protect animals from tourists because of the expense of employing on-site enforcement personnel. Voluntary compliance, however, is ineffective. The presence of official-looking volunteers may decrease the incidence of wildlife harassment by tourists. To test this possibility, we observed tourists interacting with 5- to 12-month-old New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri) at the popular Ohau Stream waterfall while in the absence or presence of a young woman in plain sight wearing a neon vest (i.e., observer) and when an observer was not present. We observed 254 tourist groups at the waterfall when young seals were present. The percentage of groups in which at least one person harassed (approached, touched, or threw objects) a young seal was two-thirds lower when the official-looking observer was present. Frequency of harassment was inversely related to observer presence. Programs in which volunteers work at tourist sites are popular in countries with high tourism rates, such as New Zealand. Our results show that a relatively inexpensive and effective tourism-management strategy may be to post such volunteers as observers at sites where tourists view wildlife. ©2010 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01611.x","CE","CE_8647",216,0.280356075415035,0.0936380243691911,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

This study assesses the numbers and types of strandings before and after the creation of the sanctuary. Monitoring took place during 19872013, when 57 events were reported and 53 carcasses were examined by post-mortem. Events were assigned to a circumstance of death that combined post-mortem results and/or anecdotal information. The majority of records were Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (n = 47, 82%) but a few common dolphins (Delphinus delphis, n = 7, 12%) were also documented. Many (n = 19/46, 41%) of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins were 1 year old or less. Strandings averaged 2.19 per annum for all dolphin species and 1.80 for Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. When pre- (n = 20) and post-sanctuary (n = 27) data were compared for Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, anthropogenic events decreased from 30% (n = 6/20) to 7% (n = 2/27) and no intentional (illegal) killings or entanglements were recorded after 2004. Unintentional anthropogenic mortalities were primarily boat collisions (n = 4 out of 5 cases). Disease was the most frequently recorded circumstance of death (n = 21) and although the number of cases increased after 2004, this may have been due to improved pathology investigations. Live strandings were rare during the study (n = 2). Despite a significant increase in overall dolphin mortalities pre- and post-sanctuary, the number of human-induced mortality events decreased significantly. Continued monitoring and post-mortems of carcasses is recommended for managing dolphins in the sanctuary.",NA,"CE","CE_8649",238,0.16931924546336,0.162891258594203,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Herein, we examined data for 136 Florida manatees that were rehabilitated and released with telemetry tags between 1988 and 2013 to determine release outcome of each individual as either success (acclimation) or failure after at least 1 y. Ten predictor variables were statistically evaluated for potential relationships to release outcome. To assess the contribution of each predictor variable to release outcome, each variable was tested for significance in univariate analyses. Manatees born in captivity experienced poor success after release (14%), whereas the overall success of wild-born individuals was higher (72%). When compared with other variables in our dataset, number of days in captivity was the strongest predictor for determining success. Manatees rescued as calves and held in captivity for more than 5 y had a high likelihood of failure, while subadults and adults had a high likelihood of success, regardless of the amount of time spent in captivity. Ensuring the success of individual manatees after release is critical for evaluating the contribution of the manatee rehabilitation program to the growth of the wild population.","10.1578/AM.42.3.2016.376","CE","CE_8650",199,0.205664117395813,0.182711063341252,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Net fishery bycatch is considered a major risk for the populations around Japan, and mitigation measures are required. We carried out a long-term study to assess the efficiency of acoustic pingers in reducing the encounter rates of narrow-ridged finless porpoises with fishing nets. We used a passive ultrasonic event recorder (A-tag) to obtain acoustic encounter rates of echolocating finless porpoises and compared results for the presence and absence of pinger transmissions in Omura Bay, Japan, over two 8-mo periods (2011 and 2012). Encounter rates were significantly lower during periods when pingers were in operation, but the effect of pingers decreased with time. By the eighth month of the study in each study year, the number of encounters during the ensonified period was greater than that during periods without pingers, suggesting habituation. When pingers were reactivated at the study site after 4 mo of silence, the encounters with the active pingers returned to the lower level observed at the beginning of the experiment. These results reveal that the pingers effectively induce avoidance in porpoises, but that this effectiveness only lasts for a few months, which is likely due to habituation which could be mitigated by alternating periods of several months of silence between periods of active pinger use.","10.3354/esr00776","CE","CE_8651",223,0.126568455603772,0.0400268924952236,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8652,2018,"Behavioral responses of Australian fur seals to boat approaches at a breeding colony","Nature Conservation","In Australia, a multi-million-dollar industry is based on viewing the Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus), predominantly through boat visits to breeding colonies. Regulation of boat approaches varies by site and no systematic investigations have been performed to inform management guidelines. To investigate possible effects of disturbance, experimental boat approaches were made to a colony at Kanowna Island in northern Bass Strait and seal responses were monitored using instantaneous scan sampling. Colony attendance (individuals remaining ashore) was found to be influenced by approach distance and time of day, but was not affected by environmental variables or season, whereas onshore resting behavior was influenced by approach distance, time of day, ambient temperature and wind direction. Onshore resting behavior decreased following experimental boat approaches to 75 m, but changes in abundance of individuals ashore were not observed at this distance. In contrast, approaches to 25 m elicited a strong response, with a steep decline in the number of individuals ashore. This response was strongest when approaches occurred in the morning, with a decline of approximately 47% of individuals, compared to a decline of 21% during afternoon approaches. With regard to onshore resting behavior, afternoon approaches to 75 m led to minimal response. The remaining three combinations of approach distance and time of day had a similar pattern of reductions in the proportion of individuals engaging in onshore resting behavior. The strongest response was again seen during approaches to 25 m conducted in the morning. These behavior changes suggest that unrestricted boat-based ecotourism at Australian fur seal colonies has the potential to increase energy expenditure and reduce the number of seals ashore. Increasing minimum approach distances to =75 m and/or restricting visits to afternoons may minimize these impacts at Kanowna Island during the post-molt and non-breeding seasons. As several studies have demonstrated considerable intra-species variation in seal responses to boat approaches, research at other colonies is needed before these findings can be generalized to the remainder of the Australian fur seal population.",NA,"CE","CE_8652",329,0.171325105157887,0.0601234715397681,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
8653,2011,"Translocation as a tool for conservation of the Hawaiian monk seal","Biological Conservation","The deteriorating demographic status of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal has motivated renewed and expanded proposals for conservation action, including translocation of seals to improve survival. Over the past three decades, numerous monk seal translocations have been conducted with a variety of objectives, including mitigating shark predation and conspecific male aggression, reducing human-seal interactions, and taking advantage of favorable foraging habitats to improve survival. Here, we analyze our cumulative experience with translocation of Hawaiian monk seals. We found a strong correlation between the time seals remained in the vicinity of the release site and their age. Recently weaned pups (with little or no at-sea foraging experience) exhibited high fidelity to release sites commensurate with that shown by untranslocated pups to their birth location. In contrast, juvenile and adult seals tended to stray from their release locations farther and sooner. Nevertheless, when 21 adult male seals were moved more than 1000. km from Laysan Island in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), to the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), they subsequently dispersed among the MHI; however, only one was observed to return to the NWHI. Translocated seals appeared to survive at rates comparable to seals native to the release site. Outcomes suggest that in most cases the intended objectives of translocations were achieved. Except for one notable case, translocations within the MHI to arrest human-seal interactions were mostly unsuccessful. These findings will be essential for informing successful large-scale translocation plans in the future. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2011.07.030","CE","CE_8653",244,0.197955403829146,0.13664654307458,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

This may indicate that whaling has long-term demographic effects on this species or that other endogenous or exogenous processes are inhibiting population growth. This study investigates the status of mature sperm bulls offAlbany, Western Australia, a population reduced through whaling by 74% between 1955 and 1978. We conducted an aerial survey designed as far as possible to provide an index of abundance comparable with that derived from the whale 'spotter' planes employed by the Albany whaling company from 1968 to 1978, using the number of sperm bulls seen on each morning flight as a comparative index between bulls seen historically and in 2009. The mean number of sperm bulls seen on transect in 2009 was 2.43 (95% percentile interval [0.96, 6.08]); this increased to 3.38 (95% percentile interval [1.30, 7.60]) when sightings offtransect were included. Both 2009 point estimates were lower than the mean (±SE) number seen in any of the years between 1968 and 1978, which ranged from 6.30 (±1.18) in 1976 to 12.45 (±1.83) in 1968.

Although these programs have enhanced bathing safety, reducing the environmental impacts of decades of fishing for large sharks and the associated by-catch remains a challenge. Over the past three decades, there have been several interventions to reduce such impact in the KZN program. The first was the release of all live sharks, including those species known to be responsible for fatal shark attacks. Measures to reduce catches of sharks associated with the winter influx of shoals of sardines, Sardinops sagax, have been increasingly successful. In addition, extensive removal of nets has resulted in a major reduction in effort. Collectively, these initiatives reduced mortalities of sharks by 64%. Baited lines, termed drumlines, were introduced at 18 beaches, where they replaced some of the nets. The former had a far lower by-catch of rays, turtles and cetaceans and significantly lower catches of certain shark species.

8668,2013,"Prospects for captive breeding of poorly known small cetacean species","Endangered Species Research","Because of the precarious condition of small cetacean species and subpopulations listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered by the IUCN, use of captive breeding for conservation has been suggested for some of them, and will likely be suggested for others. A successful captive breeding program for a new species cannot be implemented until reliable capture and husbandry techniques have been developed. Techniques for assisted reproduction and reintroduction may also be needed. We review attempts to capture, maintain, and breed poorly known small cetaceans and discuss assisted reproductive technologies (ART) that have been used to enhance captive breeding efforts for other small cetaceans. We conclude that the techniques required for successful captive breeding of most Endangered or Critically Endangered small cetacean species have not been sufficiently developed. Development of these techniques should begin before a species or population is Critically Endangered. In particular, ARTs tend to be species specific, necessitating considerable time, money, and research to develop for each species of concern. Critically Endangered populations cannot afford to lose the individuals needed for technique development. The fairly large captive population sizes necessary (to avoid loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding, and genetic adaptation to captivity), limited space available in aquariums, and high costs of captive breeding and reintroduction programs make it unlikely that captive breeding will play a major role in the conservation of most small cetaceans. The substantive conservation measures needed to prevent extinction of Critically Endangered small cetaceans is reduction or elimination of their primary threats, which are usually by-catch and habitat loss.","10.3354/esr00461","CE","CE_8668",254,0.301290358297086,-0.178974381207549,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Although the behavioural response, in most groups, resulted in an increase in distance from the source (potential avoidance), there was no evidence that either 'ramp-up' or the constant source at a higher level was superior for triggering whales to move away from the source vessel.

8675,2013,"Long-term impacts of fish provisioning on the behavior and survival of wild bottlenose dolphins","Biological Conservation","To promote close encounters with wildlife, humans sometimes provision wild animals with food. However such practices can be harmful, and the impacts of human provisioning on wild animals can be difficult to determine, especially indirect effects such as those on the offspring of provisioned animals. In Shark Bay, Australia, a small subset of the resident population of bottlenose dolphins is regularly provisioned with fish handouts under the supervision of the West Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC). Previous studies have shown that calves born to provisioned females experienced reduced care and higher mortality relative to calves of non-provisioned mothers. These results led to changes in the management practices in 1994, which we assessed the efficacy of by comparing (1) calf mortality before and after the intervention and (2) behavior of provisioned with non-provisioned dolphins in the population. Although calves born to provisioned females exhibited higher survivorship (86.7%) than before the intervention (23.1%, 2=9.05, df=1, p=0.003, N=28), group differences in maternal and calf activity budgets were still observed over the course of calf development. Provisioned mothers provided less care to their calves and their calves appeared to compensate by foraging more and separating more from their mothers compared to their non-provisioned counterparts (N=114 calves). Our study shows that careful regulation and reduced wildlife provisioning can increase calf survivorship, but behavioral development continues to be affected. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2013.01.001","CE","CE_8675",224,0.233681436344431,0.0664148552436669,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Whale-watching is promoted as a platform for education and conservation awareness of marine biodiversity. In Peru, where cetacean species are still in jeopardy, whale-watching may play an important part in promoting the protection of these species. This study aimed to determine the degree of whale-watching tourists' knowledge regarding cetacean ecology and conservation status and to evaluate if whale-watching tours could serve as platforms for educating the public and raising conservation awareness. The results of 196 closed-ended questionnaires and 20 open-ended interviews conducted before and after whale-watching tours, during the humpback whale season (winterspring 2014) in northern Peru, revealed an overall lack of knowledge concerning the presence of species of cetaceans in Peruvian waters and threats to marine biodiversity. However, after the whale-watching excursion, participants said they would be more willing to change their behaviour with respect to cetacean conservation and marine environment protection. This study suggests that whale-watching platforms, when implemented with adequate interpreters, can serve as a source of environmental education and can raise conservation awareness. This is an important conservation strategy to consider in countries, such as Peru, where by-catch and direct hunting are decimating local cetacean populations.","10.1002/aqc.2754","CE","CE_8676",221,0.211193249812295,0.29142960140867,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Stranded pups often are collected and admitted to rehabilitation centers, and then released when they reach a weight of 22 kg and meet a variety of preestablished health and release conditions. While rehabilitation is common practice, it is unclear if rehabilitated seal pups behave like wild weaned pups. Using satellite transmitters, we compared movement patterns of 10 rehabilitated pups with 10 wild weaned pups. When released, rehabilitated seals were longer and heavier than wild pups, while wild pups had a larger mean axillary girth. No clinically different blood parameters were detected. On average, rehabilitated harbor seal pups traveled nearly twice as far cumulatively, almost three times as far daily, and dispersed over three times as far from the release site compared to wild weaned seals. Additionally, wild harbor seals transmitted nearly twice as long as did rehabilitated seals. These patterns suggest that learned behavior during the brief 3-4 wk nursing period likely enables wild harbor seal pups to move less daily and remain closer to their weaning site than rehabilitated pups. © 2012 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.","10.1111/mms.12002","CE","CE_8677",194,0.189580232733668,0.17166059467197,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

During 1984-1995, the pro-gram collected 98 young female monk seals whose mortality appeared certain (underweight and in some cases ill) from French Frigate Shoals (FFS) and attempted to nourish and rehabilitate these animals to enable their release as healthy individ-uals. Six additional young females of normal size were relocated from FFS (5) and Oahu (1) to Kure Atoll where their survival rate was expected to be higher than at their birth islands. The goal of the program was salvaging the reproductive potential of young female monk seals to aid in the recov-ery of this endangered species. Of the 104 animals collected, 17 died in captivity, 13 were converted to permanent captivity (for health or behavioral reasons), and the remaining 74 were released at Kure Atoll or Midway Islands within 14 mo of col-lection. Survival during the first year post-release was compromised, compared to native seals (born at the release site) but was similar to survival of natives in the second year. The released monk seals migrated among the three westernmost atolls at a higher rate than native seals. Monk seal moni-toring continued through 2005 when 32 animals were known to be alive; they, with their offspring, constituted at least 12 to 14% of the animals in the three western NWHI populations.

In an effort to develop non-lethal methods of mitigating predation, the feasibility of deploying potential shark deterrents at FFS was examined, and then tests were done to see if any of the successfully deployed devices or a continuous human presence deters shark predation of monk seal pups. During the feasibility trial, an underwater acoustic playback and a moored boat performed without issue. A float array proved hazardous to non-target wildlife and electronic diver devices functioned poorly; both were omitted from further experimentation. The number of shark sightings and predation incidents at two pupping islets was compared across two experimental treatments: (1) acoustic playback and a moored boat, and (2) continuous human presence, versus a control. Sharks were sighted with a remote camera system; predation incidents were evident from bite wounds or the disappearance of pups. Observed shark activity was rare (12 sightings on video and six predation incidents) but similar to recent years. The number of shark sightings and predation incidents did not differ significantly between the two treatments and the control. The relative scarcity of shark activity in the shallows around the pupping islets made detecting a treatment effect challenging. Sharks' wariness to humans is probably variable, unpredictable, possibly individualistic and unreliable at FFS. The acoustic playback as a deterrent could benefit from further testing and development. Other non-lethal or lethal approaches for mitigating predation should be investigated to protect monk seal pups at FFS. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","10.1002/aqc.2272","CE","CE_8683",275,0.25027817285922,-0.271907886851474,"300","negative","negative_300",0

In 1988, the Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary was established to reduce gillnet mortalities of Hector's dolphin Cephalorhynchus hectori, an endangered dolphin species endemic to New Zealand. This study assesses the effectiveness of the MPA in improving the survival rate of Hector's dolphin at Banks Peninsula. 2.Over 21years, we undertook photo-identification surveys of Hector's dolphins along standardized transects from small outboard-powered boats. From 1986 to 2006, we photographically captured 462 reliably marked individuals. We estimated mean annual survival during the pre-sanctuary and post-sanctuary periods by applying a Bayesian random effects capture-recapture model to the data. Population growth was estimated from population simulations using a stage-structured matrix model. 3.We estimate a 90% probability that survival has improved between the pre-sanctuary and post-sanctuary periods, with estimates of mean survival probability increasing by 5·4% (from 0·863 to 0·917). This improvement in survival corresponds to a 6% increase in mean annual population growth (from 0·939 to 0·995). 4.Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates improvement in a demographic parameter of an endangered marine mammal species following conservation action. Our results provide evidence that area-based protection measures can be effective for marine mammals.

However, ADDs have also been highlighted as a conservation concern since they can inflict large-scale habitat exclusion in toothed whales (odontocetes). We tested a new method that selectively inflicted startle responses in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) at close ranges to the loudspeaker but not in a non-target species, the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), by using a frequency range where porpoise hearing was less sensitive than that of phocid seals. The sound exposure consisted of isolated 200ms long, 2-3 octave-band noise pulses with a peak frequency of 1kHz, which were presented at a source level of ~180dB re 1µPa. Field tests were carried out within a 2-month period on a fish farm on the west coast of Scotland where marine mammal behaviour was observed within three distance categories. Seal numbers dropped sharply during sound exposure compared with control observation periods within 250m of the sound source but were unaffected at distances further away from the farm. A Poisson regression model revealed that the number of seal tracks within 250m of the device decreased by ~91% during sound exposure and was primarily influenced by sound exposure with no evidence for a change in the effect of treatment such as habituation, throughout the experiment. In contrast to seals, there was no shift in the number of porpoise groups in each distance category as a result of sound exposure and porpoises were regularly seen close to the device. We also sighted six common minke whales during sound exposure while only one was seen during control periods. Our data demonstrate that the startle method can be used to selectively deter seals without affecting porpoises.","10.1111/acv.12141","CE","CE_8686",285,0.177279750877093,-0.00563850274161768,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8688,2015,"Two devices for mitigating odontocete bycatch and depredation at the hook in tropical pelagic longline fisheries","ICES Journal of Marine Science","Odontocete bycatch on and depredation from tropical pelagic longlines is globally widespread, having negative impacts on the economic viability of affected fisheries and on the conservation of affected odontocete populations. Reports by fishers that depredating odontocetes avoid gear tangles has underpinned the development of simulated structures to physically deter depredating odontocetes. This study assessed the efficacy of two such devices developed to mitigate odontocete depredation and associated bycatch. Of particular interest was their impact on (i) soak depth and (ii) sink rate using truncated trials, before determining their impact under full operational conditions on rates of (iii) catch of the five most economically important fish, and (iv) odontocete depredation and bycatch, on changes in (v) fish survival and size, and (vi) setting and hauling speed. The results indicated that the inclusion of devices on longlines had negligible impact on soak depth, thus were unlikely to impact on the suite of fish specifically targeted and caught. The sink rate was slowed, perhaps by drag, trapped air, or propeller wash, although the addition of weight might remedy this if the devices were to be used in areas where seabird bycatch could occur. Most importantly, trials conducted in Australian and in Fijian waters indicated that pooled fish catch rates (i.e. albacore, yellowfin, bigeye, mahi mahi, and wahoo) increased in the presence of the devices, possibly because more fish were attracted by them or because more depredators were deterred. Catch rates on control gear next to gear with devices attached were higher than more distant control gear, suggesting the influences of the devices may have extended to adjacent branchlines. The size of caught fish was mostly unaffected, although the survival of yellowfin and bigeye increased significantly in the presence of the devices. Hauling was slowed by the use of the devices and the need for an extra crewmember during setting and hauling, which could be cost prohibitive in some fisheries, especially if economic benefits from their use are not obvious. Despite the small sample size, odontocete bycatch only occurred on unprotected fishing gear and all individuals were released alive, although their fate was uncertain; there was evidence of injuries sustained from the event. The outcomes are positive and should motivate stakeholders to view such devices as a potentially effective tool for mitigating odontocete bycatch and depredation in this and similar longline fisheries. Future efforts should focus on improving operational integration and reducing implementation costs to encourage voluntary uptake and thus avoid non-compliance and the need for costly monitoring. The use of this technology could bring about marked improvements to the conservation situation for affected odontocete populations and to the economic situation for affected longline fisheries.",NA,"CE","CE_8688",443,0.372974336870462,0.141628024085028,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Entanglements have been implicated in preventing the recovery of some large whale populations. Acoustic deterrents on fishing nets are widely used to reduce incidental captures of dolphins and porpoises, but there is little evidence as to whether they effectively deter large whales. We tested whether a low-frequency whale alarm (3 kHz Whale Pinger®, 135 ± 5 db, 5 s emission interval and 400 ms emission duration) deterred Southern Hemisphere humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae from approaching a potential source of entanglement. Northerly migrating humpback whale pods were tracked by an observer blind to alarm status (on/off) as they passed an alarm moored in the centre of the peak migration path. Of 137 pods tracked, 82 (60%) passed within the assumed detectable range (500 m) of the alarm, 51/78 (65%) when it was on and 31/59 (52%) when it was off(p = 0.18). There was no discernible response to the alarm. Whale pods did not differ in directionality, course heading or dive duration when within detectable range of the alarm, whether it was on or off, and a number of pods passed directly over the alarm while it was operational. This suggests that single alarms as currently configured and attached to a trap or pot line are unlikely to effectively deter humpback whales from approaching potential hazards, at least during their northerly migration phase.","10.3354/esr00614","CE","CE_8689",236,0.279596030278263,-0.192895324520535,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

In this study, four netting vessels less than 10m long used AQUAmark pingers on part of their nets off the southwest coast of Britain over a 12 month period. Boat skippers recorded ease of use. Acoustic click detectors were deployed on test and control nets to assess the response of cetaceans to the pingers. No significant practical problems, apart from premature failure of pingers, were encountered. During the study, only one harbour porpoise was bycaught, in an unpingered net. In 650 days of acoustic data from pingered and non-pingered nets, matched by location, date and boat, there was a highly significant reduction in the number of porpoise clicks recorded at nets with pingers to 48% of the number predicted from the number recorded at control nets (range 35-51%). To assess habituation, single, modified pingers that were active for alternate seven hour periods were moored below a click detector at two sites, one of which has strong tides and high levels of associated ambient noise. This study showed a stronger pinger effect at the quiet site and a much reduced effect at the noisy site. There was evidence of a period of exclusion of porpoises following pinger use that could exceed seven hours, and no evidence of habituation. Results suggest that pingers are practical on small vessels, that they reduce harbour porpoise activity around nets and are therefore likely to reduce bycatch. Easier means of detecting pinger failure are needed. Pingers should be considered as a bycatch mitigation method in small vessel fisheries using bottom set nets.",NA,"CE","CE_8690",291,0.162755581763535,0.00786355291412286,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

The analysis focused on interventions undertaken to enhance survival of individual seals by reducing or eliminating immediate mortality risks. These interventions included dehookings, disentanglements, removing seals from high predation zones, medical interventions, and related activities. A total of 885 interventions occurred range-wide from 1980 to 2012. These included 645 inter -ventions classified as mitigating medium- to high-risk threats, involving 532 different seals. In the Northwest Hawaiian Islands, where most of these interventions took place, we found a significant relationship between the number of interventions conducted annually and duration of field effort. The survival and reproduction of the intervention seals were tracked through multiple generations, using (1) known survival and reproduction of intervention seals, and (2) expected survival and reproduction as determined using demographic rates estimated for the population at large. This analysis indicated that 17-24% of the 2012 population comprised either intervention seals or descendants of intervention seals. If seals included in a multiyear (1984-1992) re habilitation and captive care effort are also included, this proportion increases to 32%. These findings demonstrate the important link between the sustained population assessment field effort, the number of interventions that are enabled in association with those efforts, and the current status of the monk seal population. In contrast to a metaphorical 'silver bullet' whereby a result is achieved through a single (or a few) highly impactive tools, we liken our success in applying multiple interventions to a fusillade of many silver BBs 1 .","10.3354/esr00612","CE","CE_8692",252,0.258108682664099,0.109851807702223,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Only surveys in 1993,2005 and 2007 had enough sightings to construct independent density estimates, whereas the surveys in 1984-85 and 1987-89 had to be merged and treated as two surveys. The annual rate of increase was 9.4% yr1 (SE = 0.01) between 1984 and 2007. This rate of increase is higher than the increase estimated at the breeding grounds in the West Indies, but is of the same magnitude as the observed rate of increase at other feeding grounds in the North Atlantic. A matrix model based on observed life history parameters revealed that the theoretical growth rate of a humpback whale population ranged between 1 and 11%. This confirms that the observed growth in West Greenland is within the plausible values. The survey in 2007 was used to make a fully corrected abundance estimate including corrections for whales that were submerged during the passage of the survey plane. The line transect estimate for 2007 was 1,020 (CV = 0.35). When the estimate was corrected for perception bias with mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) methods, the abundance increased to 1,505 (0.49). A correction for availability bias was developed based on time-depth-recorder information on the time spent at the surface (0-4m). However, used directly this correction leads to a positively-biased abundance estimate and instead a correction was developed for the non-instantaneous visual sighting process in an aircraft. The resulting estimate for 2007 was 3,272 (CV = 0.50) for the MRDS analysis. An alternative strip census estimate deploying a strip width of 300m resulted in 995 (0.33) whales.

In Alaska, tourism near tidewater glaciers has attracted millions of visitors and increased the presence of ships, tour vessels, and coastal development. Although sustainable tourism, resulting from balanced effects on wildlife and client satisfaction, is a goal of most tourism operators, it is not always achieved. Voluntary compliance with viewing guidelines and codes of conduct have been encouraged, but few assessments have the longitudinal scope to evaluate long-term changes in impacts on wildlife and the ability of vessel operators and kayak guides to sustain lower impact operating practices over time. This study assessed vessel and kayak visitation and resulting impacts on harbor seals in the Kenai Fjords National Park, southcentral Alaska. We obtained observations from 2002 to 2011, using remotely controlled video cameras located near Aialik and Pedersen Glaciers in the Kenai Fjords National Park. Overall, disturbance was associated with 5.1% of vessel sightings, 28% of vessel interactions (vessel observed within approx. 300 m of seals), 11.5% of kayak sightings, and 61% of kayak interactions. Results demonstrated that voluntary changes in operations significantly reduced vessel and kayak disturbance of seals by 60-80%. Even with prior establishment of operating guidelines, tour vessel captains were able to further reduce their effect on wildlife with more careful operations. Rapid growth of guided kayak excursions that occurred during this study caused greater disturbance to seals than motorized vessels but guide trainings helped reduce disturbances. Diminished impacts of motor vessels and kayakers persisted across years although effects of kayaks were less consistent than motor vessels, which reflected greater variability in inter-annual spatial use patterns by kayakers. Long-term monitoring, including assessments of wildlife responses to vessel and kayak operations, combined with 2-way communication with vessel operators and guides, enhanced the effectiveness of mitigation and facilitated adaptive adjustments to mitigation protocols over time. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.510","CE","CE_8697",312,0.332924583146163,0.225049683703768,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1
8700,2015,"Seal exclusion devices in cod pots prevent seal bycatch and affect their catchability of cod","Fisheries Research","In order to maintain a viable inshore fishing industry, it is important to limit the incidence of seal-inflicted damage to static fishing gear and additional catch losses. Studies in the Baltic Sea have shown that this could be achieved by implementing alternative fishing methods, e.g. by using fish pots instead of lines or gillnets. However, as in net and line fisheries, a pot fishery could also result in bycatch of seals. In order to prevent these bycatches, pot entrances were equipped with seal exclusion devices (SEDs) of various sizes and shapes. A field study was conducted to investigate what effect different types of SEDs had on the bycatch of seals as well as on the pot's catchability. When pots where equipped with SEDs the bycatch of seals was reduced to zero without negatively affecting the pot's catchability. The shape and size of the entrance did have a significant effect on the pot's catchability and the size of the fish. Using symmetrical oval shaped entrances along with larger rectangular entrances divided into two smaller openings increased the pot's catchability.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.01.013","CE","CE_8700",180,0.149649529344527,0.00337996935698861,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
8702,2014,"Effectiveness of mandatory vessel speed limits for protecting North Atlantic right whales","Endangered Species Research","To reduce right whale Eubalaena glacialis deaths caused by ship collisions along the US East Coast, a rule was implemented on 8 December 2008 requiring all vessels =65 feet (19.8 m) to travel 10 knots (18.5 km h-1) or less in 10 seasonal management areas (SMAs). To evaluate the effectiveness of this rule, we plotted the locations of all right whale and humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae carcasses attributed to ship-strikes since December 1990 in US waters to determine their proximity to SMAs. In the 18 yr pre-rule period, 13 of 15 (87%) right whales and 12 of 26 (46%) humpback whales killed by ships were found inside later SMA boundaries or within 45 nmi (83 km) of their perimeters during later active dates. In the first 5 yr after the rule became effective, no ship-struck right whales were found inside or within 45 nmi of any active SMA. This was nearly twice as long as the longest pre-rule period without discovery of a ship-struck carcass in those areas during effective time periods. Based on the 18 yr pre-rule period, bootstrap resampling analyses revealed that the probability of finding no ship-struck whales in or near SMAs during the first 5 yr post-rule period would be a statistically significant reduction in such deaths (p = 0.031). The results suggest the rule has been effective at reducing right whale deaths. We suggest enlarging SMAs to include additional parts of the right whale migratory corridor.","10.3354/esr00586","CE","CE_8702",226,0.201999702269711,0.231358191856061,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8708,2014,"Acoustic alarms reduce bycatch of harbour porpoises in Danish North Sea gillnet fisheries","Fisheries Research","A double-blind experiment in the Danish gillnet fishery for cod (Gadus morhua) demonstrated that pingers can substantially reduce bycatch of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena). Fourteen vessels fished a total of 168 days in the North Sea in 1997. In the wreck fishery the total effort was 1052 nets with active pingers, 1056 nets with dummy pingers and 74 nets without pingers. Eight porpoises were caught, all in nets with dummy pingers. In the flat bottom/stony ground fishery the total effort was 5596 nets with active pingers, 5210 nets with dummy pingers and 2973 nets without pingers. Sixteen porpoises were caught, including 1 animal in a net with active pingers, 6 in nets with dummy pingers and 9 in nets without pingers. The difference in bycatch between nets with active pingers and nets with inactive or no pingers was highly significant (p<. 0.007) for both the wreck fishery and the flat bottom/stony ground fishery. We conclude that the direct effects of the pinger signals on the porpoises caused the reduction in bycatch, which means that the results can be generalized to other situations where harbour porpoises are taken in gillnets. Generalized linear modelling demonstrated that cod cpue was not affected negatively by pingers. It was furthermore estimated that the stony ground fishery had significantly lower (p<. 0.001) cpue values (a factor 0.47) compared to the wreck fishery. The results of this experiment led to the introduction of pingers in Danish gillnet fisheries in 2001 and were also part of the basis for EU Council Regulation 812/2004 introducing EU-wide use of pingers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2014.01.010","CE","CE_8708",251,0.15543508026558,-0.0340214032625674,"300","neutral","neutral_300",1

The trial was designed as a controlled experiment where nets without pingers formed the control group (41 hauls) and nets with pingers spaced at 455 m (24 hauls) and 585 m (43 hauls), respectively, formed the 2 experimental groups. Nets without pingers had a bycatch frequency of 0.54 incidents per haul, nets with pingers spaced at 585 m had a bycatch frequency of 0.12 incidents per haul, and nets with pingers spaced at 455 m had a bycatch frequency of 0. The bycatch frequencies for the 2 experimental groups were both significantly different from the bycatch frequencies of the control group (p < 0.0001). These results show that the spacing of the Aquatec AQUAmark100 pinger can be increased without reducing the effectiveness of the pinger in mitigating harbour porpoise bycatch, thereby reducing some of the disadvantages of widespread pinger deployment. The results also stress the importance of basing implementation regulation on solid evidence and led the Danish Fisheries Directorate in 2007 to allow the use of the AQUAmark100 pinger with a spacing of up to 455 m under derogation to the European Union's Council Regulation No. 812/2004.","10.3354/esr00494","CE","CE_8710",211,0.0676586951821804,0.0567018090227406,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The nature of interactions and effectiveness of a seal exclusion device (SED) in mitigating lethal interactions was assessed using underwater video. Recent fishing activity and the phase of the trawl operation significantly influenced interaction rates; interactions increased with the amount of recent trawl activity and were highest while the trawl was being set. Most seals accessed the trawl via the net entrance and exited via an escape opening located at the base of the SED. The size of the escape opening was the only operational factor that influenced mortality rates  simply enlarging the escape hole reduced lethal interactions by 79%. However, since all deceased seals dropped out of the net before they were brought on board, they would have gone unobserved without video monitoring. Limiting the concentration of fishing activity in space and time and refinement of the SED design, in particular to address dropouts, is recommended if mortality rates are to be reduced.","10.1139/cjfas-2015-0273","CE","CE_8714",172,0.187941358875416,-0.122958737866759,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
8716,2013,"Using pingers to reduce bycatch of small cetaceans in Peru's small-scale driftnet fishery","Oryx","There is growing awareness that small-scale fisheries may have large impacts on threatened marine fauna. Bycatch of small cetaceans by the Peruvian small-scale driftnet fleet results in the deaths of thousands of animals annually. We sought to assess the effectiveness of acoustic alarms (pingers) for reducing the incidental capture of dolphins and porpoises by this fleet. Forty-three experimental trips (156 fishing sets) and 47 control trips (195 fishing sets) out of Salaverry Port, northern Peru, were observed from April 2009 to August 2011. Twenty-two percent of control sets captured small cetaceans (67 individuals) and 16% of experimental sets had captures of small cetaceans (33 individuals). The bycatch rate of experimental sets was 0.50 individuals km-2h-1, whereas for control sets the rate was 0.80 individuals km-2h-1. This 37% reduction in bycatch rate suggests that pingers may be effective in reducing the bycatch of small cetaceans in this fishery. Catch rates of the fishery's target shark and ray species were unchanged. Given the vast size of this fishery and its current levels of bycatch of small cetaceans (>Â 10,000 individuals annually), even the modest declines in bycatch we observed could result in reductions in mortality of hundreds or thousands of small cetaceans per annum. Challenges, including increased costs, to large-scale utilization of pingers have yet to be overcome.

In Brazil habitat destruction and overhunting severely reduced and fragmented the wild population, restricting extant subpopulations to the north and north-east coast. In response to these threats an ambitious government-led programme was initiated in 1994, with the aim of rehabilitating orphaned manatee calves and releasing them into the southernmost subpopulation. The programme is unique within Brazil, and has invested unprecedented resources in post-release monitoring. So far 30 manatees have been released at three sites, with a high rate of success (> 75%). Time in captivity appears to be a key variable determining post-release success: too long or too short a time in captivity decreasing the probability of survival. We describe the main features of this long-term programme and identify six key lessons learnt: (1) close monitoring, health assessments and rescues can significantly increase the success of releases, (2) combining different monitoring techniques results in high-quality data and reduces tracking costs, (3) long-term studies are needed to effectively evaluate the results, (4) releasing manatees at c. 5 years of age can increase chances of success, (5) soft-release is important to aid acclimatization, and (6) the programme has been effective in raising awareness among the general public, supporting education and fund-raising.",NA,"CE","CE_8722",219,0.541447888738049,0.184664200906491,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8724,2017,"An integrated approach for assessing translocation as an effective conservation tool for Hawaiian monk seals","Endangered Species Research","For threatened and endangered species, translocations have been widely used to mitigate multiple sources of mortality that threaten population recovery. Although numerous Hawaiian monk seals Neomonachus schauinslandi have been translocated for a variety of purposes, few monk seal translocations have addressed the problem of prey limitation. To assess the efficacy of using translocations to mitigate reduced prey availability, 12 weanling monk seals were translocated with pre-release health screening and post-release monitoring. Specifically, the health, foraging behavior, habitat use, and survival of translocated seals were compared with those of 17 monk seals resident to the release site. There was little evidence of infectious diseases in translocated and resident seals, although Chlamydophila abortus antibodies and enteric bacteria were detected in many individuals. Translocated and resident weanling seals also demonstrated similar diving, movements, and habitat use, whereas resident adult seals had greater variability in foraging patterns. First-year survival for translocated weanlings (50%, n = 12) and non-translocated weanlings at the donor (31%, n = 36) and recipient sites (69%, n = 16) was related to weaning body size, with larger individuals having greater survivorship. These results supported 3 main conclusions that have important consequences for future translocation and population recovery efforts: (1) there was minimal risk of exposing seals to novel infectious diseases as a result of translocation; (2) individuals translocated with limited foraging experience rapidly adapted to their post-release environment; and (3) translocation for the purpose of mitigating prey limitation is a viable and important conservation tool for Hawaiian monk seals.","10.3354/esr00788","CE","CE_8724",239,0.326863415429761,0.0237819285077508,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Acoustic recorders were used to document sperm whale creak-pause events, representative of depredation of the longline gear. Although there were more sablefish per skate quad on the beaded gear and there was a decrease in depredation events on the beaded gear compared with the control, neither effect was significant (p = 0.205 and 0.364, respectively).

Documented effects on pinnipeds in proximity to humans include changes in behaviour, site use and potentially higher aggression levels towards people. Effects vary considerably between populations and sites, thus requiring separate assessment of human impacts on activity and energy budgets. Responses of the endangered Australian sea lion, Neophoca cinerea, to human visitation were recorded from November 2013 through April 2014. Exposure levels and response types to anthropogenic activities were assessed at two easily accessible locations with different management schemes, Seal (landing prohibited) and Carnac (landing permitted) islands, Western Australia. Exposure levels were measured as both stimulus type (i.e. People, Paddlers, Small, Medium, and Large vessels, Tour vessels, and Jet skies), and people (Direct, Attract, Interact, View, Incidental, Water, Low-level), and vessel activities (Interact, Approach/Follow, Anchor noise, Engine noise, Close to beach, Moderate/Fast travel, Slow travel, Transit, Drift/At anchor, Aircraft noise). Exposure levels varied significantly between the islands in numbers, stimuli type, duration and minimum approach distances. The instantaneous behaviours of Lift head, Interact and Sit were the most frequent responses. Aggressive and Retreat responses, the highest disturbance levels measured, occurred on Carnac approximately once per day, but rarely on Seal Island. Aggressive behaviour towards People was observed only on Carnac Island and elicited only by People. People, Tour vessels, and scenic Aircrafts on both islands as well as Jet skis on Carnac Island had the highest probability of triggering responses. Owing to their relatively high visitation at Seal Island, Paddle powered vessels, followed by Tour vessels elicited the highest number of responses, compared with People, Small, and Medium vessels at Carnac Island. The majority of responses occurred when any stimulus type was at short-range (=10 m), and People Viewing N. cinerea elicited most. Vessels triggered more responses at larger ranges than People. To limit close-range access to N. cinerea, one possibility is to close the beach at Carnac Island to human visitation and increase the minimum approach distance by vessels and People by installing marker buoys at least 15 m from the shore. © 2016 The Authors.

This study investigated the effectiveness of 2 distinct tones for use as an alarm to acoustically alert whales to fishing gear presence and therefore reduce the chance of entanglement. We compared how whales responded in terms of changes of surface behaviour and changes in direction of travel in response to 2 acoustic tones and when there was no alarm. These 2 acoustic tones were a 5 kHz tone (5 s emission interval and 400 ms emission duration, similar to but higher frequency than the signal from a Future Oceans F3 3 kHz Whale Pinger®) and a 2-2.1 kHz swept tone (8 s emission interval and 1.5 s emission duration). A total of 108 tracks (focal follows) were collected using a theodolite at Cape Solander, Sydney, Australia, during the whales' 2013 northern migration. Linear mixed effects models were used to determine the effect of the different acoustic tones on whale direction (heading), and behaviour (dive duration and speed). Whales showed no detectable response to either alarm. Whale direction and surfacing behaviour did not differ whether the alarm was 'on' or 'off'. Although the response may have been different if the alarms were attached to fishing gear, the lack of measurable response suggests that the types of tones used are not likely to be effective in alarms intended to reduce entanglement of northward migrating Australian humpback whales.","10.3354/esr00712","CE","CE_8733",242,0.133029863218928,0.062057753419434,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Between September 2010 and November 2011, we followed 14 stranded California sea lions that survived to release and evaluated antibiotic efficacy in eliminating lep-tospiruria (urinary shedding of leptospires). Leptospiruria was assessed by real-time PCR of urine and urine culture, with persistence assessed using longitudinally collected samples. Serum chemistry was used to assess recovery of normal renal function. Microscopic agglutination testing (MAT) was performed to assess serum anti-Lepto-spira antibody titers, and the MAT reactivity pat-terns were consistent with L. interrogans serovar Pomona infection frequently observed in this population. Animals were initially treated for 6 to 16 d (median = 10.5; mean = 10.8) with antibiot-ics from the penicillin family, with some receiving additional antibiotics to treat other medical condi-tions. All urine cultures were negative; therefore, the presence of leptospiruria was assessed using PCR. Leptospiruria continued beyond the initial course of penicillin family antibiotics in 13 of the 14 sea lions, beyond the last antibiotic dose in 11 of the 14 sea lions, beyond recovery of renal func-tion in 13 of the 14 sea lions, and persisted for at least 8 to 86 d (median = 45; mean = 46.8). Five animals were released with no negative urine PCR results detected; thus, their total shedding duration may have been longer. Cessation of leptospiruria was more likely in animals that received antibiot-ics for a greater duration, especially if coverage was uninterrupted. Real-time PCR results indicate that an antibiotic protocol commonly used to treat leptospirosis in rehabilitating California sea lions does not eliminate leptospiruria. It is possible that antibiotic protocols given for a longer duration and/or including other antibiotics may be effec-tive in eliminating leptospiruria. These results may have important human and animal health implications, especially in rehabilitation facilities, as Leptospira transmission may occur through contact with animals with persistent leptospiruria.","10.1578/AM.41.2.2015.203","CE","CE_8734",311,0.255352159419136,0.0834127702732529,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Two adult male pygmy killer whales were found live-stranded in the state of Mississippi (USA) on 1 September 2015 and were subsequently rehabilitated and returned to the offshore waters of the GoM on 11 July 2016. To monitor the animals post-release, both were tagged with satellite-linked location and dive behavior tags. Tags were programed to record and transmit dive duration and depth (when dives were = 30 m deep for = 30 s), duration of time spent above 30 m depth, and estimate locations using the Argos system. The tags transmitted for 15 and 88 days, respectively, providing a total of 1,027 filtered locations and 3,150 dive duration and maximum depth records. The animals began diving after two and four days, respectively, post-release. More than 96% of dives occurred at night. The longest recorded dive was more than 9 min in duration, and the deepest was to 368 m. More than 98% of the locations were over the GoM shelf break, spanning water 200 to 1,200 m deep. Diving patterns indicate that this species is most active at night in the GoM, suggesting its prey species are likely diel migrators that are below reachable depths during daylight hours. Near simultaneous location data from both animals confirmed that they stayed in close proximity but did not dive synchronously. Success of the rehabilitation and release was inconclusive for pygmy killer whale ID 30IMMS, whereas 31IMMS met the established criteria for success with = 6 weeks of documented post-release survival.

We investigated the efficacy of a new depredation mitigation device called ""DEPRED"" in the interaction between bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris), and small pelagic fish (SPF) attached to branchlines to simulate caught fish. We suggest implications for DEPRED efficacy with larger toothed whales interacting with pelagic longline capture in the open ocean. The design of the device uses streamers to both deter cetaceans and protect fish from predation. In controlled experiments, we tested its efficacy by observing changes in the dolphin's behaviour brought on by the presence or absence of the device on branchlines. First, dolphin-SPF interactions were observed at the small scale using video footage recorded with an underwater camcorder. Second, the efficacy of the device was quantified from interactions between dolphins and 80 branchlines deployed on a longline 500 m long baited with SPF. One half of the SPF on successive branchlines was protected by DEPRED and the other half was not. A total of 707 branchlines were set when dolphins interacted with SPF, and among them, 355 were equipped with DEPRED. Encouraging results were obtained: over the short term, the number of damaged unprotected SPF was on average more than twice the number of protected ones. Nevertheless, habituation behaviour was observed for a resident group of T. aduncus in the experimental area.

Dolphin interactions with trawls were very common (98% of day-trawls, 118 ± 16 interactions per trawl), with durations and prey consumption positively correlated with the distances ventured into the net. Acoustic deterrents (pingers) had no effect on interaction numbers or durations. Based on in-situ observations, the factors that contribute toward dolphin bycatch in demersal fish trawls were likely associated with (i) risky dolphin behaviour (i.e., entering net during hauling, residing deep within trawl for extended periods or social aggression) and (or) (ii) instability of fishing gear resulting in entrapment. Given the high level of dolphin attendance during most day-trawls, mitigation strategies that focus on improving and monitoring the stability of trawl gear would be more effective than current acoustic deterrent devices aimed at modifying dolphin behaviour.","10.1139/cjfas-2017-0203","CE","CE_8741",177,0.43082789181076,0.130537853832975,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
8742,2017,"Can fear conditioning repel California sea lions from fishing activities?","Animal Conservation","Marine mammal interactions with fisheries create conflicts that can threaten human safety, economic interests and marine mammal survival. A deterrent that capitalizes on learning mechanisms, like fear conditioning, may enhance success while simultaneously balancing welfare concerns and reduce noise pollution. During fear conditioning, individuals learn the cues that precede the dangerous stimuli, and respond by avoiding the painful situations. We tested the efficacy of fear conditioning using acoustic stimuli for reducing California sea lion Zalophus californianus interactions from two fishing contexts in California, USA; bait barges and recreational fishing vessels. We performed conditioning trials on 24 individual sea lions interacting with bait barges. We tested for acquisition of conditioned fear by pairing a neutral tone with a startle stimulus. Avoidance was strongest in response to the startle stimulus alone, but low when paired with a neutral tone. From actively fishing vessels, we tested for fear conditioning by exposing sea lions to a neutral tone followed by a startle pulse, a startle pulse alone or a no sound control. We conducted playbacks from 146 (including 48 no sound control) stops over two summer fishing seasons (2013, 2014). The startle stimulus decreased surfacing frequency, reduced bait foraging and increased surfacing distance from the vessel while the conditioned stimulus only caused a mild reduction in surfacing frequency with no other behavioral change. Exposing animals to a pair of a conditioned stimulus with a startle pulse did not achieve the intended management outcome. Rather, it generated evidence (in two study contexts) of immediate learning that led to the reduction of the unconditioned response. Taken together, our results suggest that for fear conditioning to be applied as a non-lethal deterrent, careful consideration has to be given to individual behavior, the unconditioned/conditioned responses and the overall management goals.","10.1111/acv.12329","CE","CE_8742",289,0.239562073179437,-0.13588467126264,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Responders have been reluctant to release lone delphinids due to their social needs, even when they pass the same health evaluations as mass stranded animals. This study tracked postrelease success of 34 relocated and released satellite tagged delphinids from single and mass strandings. Three postrelease survival parameters (transmission duration, swim speed, and daily distance) were examined to evaluate whether they differed among single stranded/single released (SS/SR), mass stranded/single released (MS/SR), or mass stranded/mass released (MS/MR) dolphin groups. Comparisons were also made between healthy and borderline release candidates. Satellite tags transmitted for a mean of 21.2 d (SD = 19.2, range = 1-79), daily distance traveled was 42.0 km/d (11.25, 20.96-70.72), and swim speed was 4.3 km/h (1.1, 2.15-8.54). Postrelease parameters did not differ between health status groups, however, SS/SR dolphins transmitted for a shorter mean duration than MS/MR and MS/SR groups. Postrelease vessel-based surveys confirmed conspecific group location for two healthy, MS/SR dolphins. Overall, these results support the potential to release healthy stranded single delphinids; however, further refinement of health assessment protocols for these challenging cases is needed.","10.1111/mms.12255","CE","CE_8744",194,0.248664456833205,0.0141217314364355,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Consequently, many management agencies wish to implement practical and efficient bycatch mitigation systems that both protect species of conservation concern and are readily adopted by fishermen. Australian snubfin Orcaella heinsohni and humpback dolphins Sousa chinensis occur in small fragmented populations along most of the remote coast of subtropical and tropical Australia, where they are caught in gillnet fisheries operated from small vessels. We experimentally investigated whether a commercially available acoustic alarm modified the behaviour of each of these species in the absence of a net. The movements and behaviour of both species changed subtly when the pingers were active, but the likelihood of the animals leaving an area was not significantly different from the controls. Our results suggest that this technological approach may not be effective in reducing the bycatch of these species. We suggest that further experimentation is unlikely to be cost effective and that government agencies should work with fishers and scientists to explore alternative mitigation measures.","10.3354/esr00495","CE","CE_8747",175,0.362813785625373,0.0741473539751572,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

8759,2013,"A field test of acoustic deterrent devices used to reduce interactions between bottlenose dolphins and a coastal gillnet fishery","Biological Conservation","Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) interact frequently with gillnet fisheries throughout their range. These interactions, which include the depredation of captured fish, can have deleterious impacts on both dolphins and fishermen. Acoustic deterrent devices have been proposed as one means of reducing the frequency and severity of these interactions. We studied interactions between bottlenose dolphins and a gillnet fishery for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) in North Carolina, USA and investigated the effect of SaveWave® acoustic deterrent devices on target fish catch and the frequency and nature of interactions with bottlenose dolphins. We made observations from commercial vessels and conducted focal visual and acoustic follows of dolphins from a research vessel. We examined the effects of SaveWave® devices on fish catches and dolphin behavior by comparing sets with functioning (active) devices and non-functioning (control) devices. In 2003, we collected baseline data on catch and dolphin behavior from 136 gillnet sets; during 2004 and 2005 we monitored 151 gillnet sets (83 with active devices, 68 with control devices). Fish catches were significantly lower when dolphins were observed interacting with gillnets. SaveWave® status (active versus control) did not affect fish catch, but dolphins were less likely to interact with and more likely to echolocate around gillnets equipped with active SaveWaves® than gillnets with control SaveWaves®. Despite these encouraging findings, SaveWave® devices were not sufficiently durable to be deployed effectively in this fishery. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2012.07.012","CE","CE_8759",224,0.141935302628733,-0.049070619279433,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Advances in medical diagnosis, husbandry and therapy have improved survival of rehabilitation cases, and advances in radio-telemetry have improved postrelease monitoring. In total, 69 cases (1986-2010) were evaluated, involving 10 species of odontocete cetaceans with release data. Findings suggested a success criterion of surviving at least six weeks postrelease is useful in evaluating intervention strategies. No species had better success than others. Stranded beached cetaceans were less successful than free-swimming rescued animals. Rehabilitated animals were less successful than those released without rehabilitation. Mass stranded dolphins fared better than single stranded animals. Old age, diminished hearing ability, and lack of maternal care were factors in several unsuccessful cases. Success is not clearly related to rehabilitation duration. Retaining healthy individuals from mass strandings until all animals are ready for release may reduce success for some.

Because these are primarily pelagic, continental shelf-edge animals, much of what is known about this species has derived from mass stranding events. Post-release monitoring via satellite-linked telemetry was conducted with two adult males determined on-site to be healthy, and released directly from a mass stranding of 23 pilot whales in May 2011, near Cudjoe Key, Florida. Tracking provided an opportunity to evaluate the decision for immediate release vs rehabilitation, and to learn more about the lives of members of this difficult-to-study species in the wild. The two pilot whales remained together for at least 16 d before transmissions from one pilot whale (Y-404) ceased. Dive patterns and travel rates suggested that Y-404's condition deteriorated prior to signal loss. Pilot Whale Y-400 was tracked for another 51 d, moving from the Blake Plateau to the Greater Antilles, remaining in the Windward Passage east of Cuba for the last 17 d of tracking. Once he reached the Antilles, Y-400 remained in high-relief habitat appropriate for the species and made dives within or exceeding the reported range for depth and duration for this species, following expected diel patterns, presumably reflecting continued good health. Telemetry data indicate that he made at least one dive to 1,000 to 1,500 m, and several dives lasted more than 40 min. Although the fates of the two released pilot whales may have been different, the concept of evaluating health and releasing individuals determined to be healthy at the time of stranding appears to have merit as an alternative to bringing all members of mass-stranded pilot whale groups into rehabilitation.","10.1578/AM.39.1.2013.61","CE","CE_8762",284,0.309680888816364,0.208616011691277,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8764,2017,"Field trials of an acoustic decoy to attract sperm whales away from commercial longline fishing vessels in western Gulf of Alaska","Fisheries Research","In the Gulf of Alaska, sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are known to remove sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) from commercial longline fishing gear. This removal, called depredation, is economically costly to fishermen, presents risk of injury or mortality to whales, and could lead to unknown removals during the federal sablefish longline survey that contributes to estimation of the annual fishing quota. In 2013 the Southeast Alaska Sperm Whale Avoidance Project (SEASWAP) evaluated the efficacy of an acoustic decoy in reducing encounters between sperm whales and longline fishing gear. The aim of the acoustic decoy was to use fishing vessel sounds to attract whales to an area away from the true fishing haul in order to reduce interactions between commercial fishing vessels and whales. A custom playback device that could be remotely activated via a radio modem was incorporated into an anchored buoy system that could be deployed by the vessel during a two-month trip between June and July 2013. Once activated, the decoy broadcasted vessel-hauling noises known to attract whales, while the vessel performed several true hauls at various ranges from the device. Passive acoustic recorders at both the decoy and true set locations were also deployed to evaluate whale presence. Twenty-six hauls were conducted while a decoy was deployed, yielding fourteen sets with whales present while the decoy was functional. A significant relationship was found between the number of whales present at the true fishing haul and the distance of the haul from the decoy (114 km range), with the decoy being most effective at ranges greater than 9 km (t = -2.06, df = 12, p = 0.04). The results suggest that acoustic decoys may be a cost-effective means for reducing longlining depredation from sperm and possibly killer whales under certain circumstances.","10.1016/j.fishres.2017.08.017","CE","CE_8764",286,0.28409057941571,0.0299661409593967,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

At 6 wind farms, active noise mitigation systems (NMS) were applied during most piling events, and 1 was constructed without. Based on generalized additive modelling analyses, we describe a clear gradient in the decline of porpoise detections after piling, depending on noise level and distance to piling. Declines were found at sound levels exceeding 143 dB re 1 µPa2s (the sound exposure level exceeded during 5% of piling time, SEL05) and up to 17 km from piling. When only considering piling events with NMS, the maximum effect distance was 14 km. Compared to 24-48 h before piling, porpoise detections declined more strongly during unmitigated piling events at all distances: at 10-15 km declines were around 50% during piling without NMS, but only 17% when NMS were applied. Within the vicinity (up to about 2 km) of the construction site, porpoise detections declined several hours before the start of piling and were reduced for about 1-2 d after piling, while at the maximum effect distance, avoidance was only found during the hours of piling. The application of first generation NMS thus reduced the effect range of pile driving and led to a lower decline of porpoise detections over all distances. However, NMS were still under development and did not always work with equal efficiency. As NMS have further developed since, future investigations are expected to show additional reduction of disturbance effects.","10.3354/meps12560","CE","CE_8769",256,0.168475614072554,-0.11975285501245,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8770,2013,"Seal scarers as a tool to deter harbour porpoises from offshore construction sites","Marine Ecology Progress Series","Offshore pile driving, e.g. during wind farm construction, produces substantial noise emissions into the water column, which may harm marine mammals. Therefore, it is common practice to attempt to deter the mammals out of potential danger zones beforehand. Seal scarers are commonly used as a deterrent for harbour porpoises in spite of a lack of clear evidence in support of their effectiveness. We investigated the responses of harbour porpoises to a Lofitech seal scarer by conducting visual observations in conjunction with sound measurements. Porpoise sighting rates within 1 km of the seal scarer significantly decreased to only 1% during seal scarer activity. During 22 trials, when the seal scarer was deployed between 300 m and 3.3 km distance, all observed porpoises always avoided the seal scarer within 1.9 km (translating to sound levels of =122 dB re 1 µParms), avoided the seal scarer half the time within 2.1 to 2.4 km (119 to 121 dB re 1 µParms) and never avoided the seal scarer at distances beyond 2.6 km (=118 dB re 1 µParms). The closest observed approach distance of a porpoise to the activated seal scarer was 798 m (132 dB re 1 µParms). Thus, the deployment of a Lofitech seal scarer during offshore pile driving activities can greatly reduce the risk of acoustic traumata to harbour porpoises. However, danger zones and thus the necessary deterrence zones have to be calculated specifically for each project based on measurements of sound transmission in the area. © Inter-Research 2013.",NA,"CE","CE_8770",229,0.116053845175795,-0.142564389659904,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

However, this information is crucial to understanding the effects these devices have on the marine environment and to judge their potential as a mitigation measure. A study was conducted in the German North Sea, using passive acoustic monitoring and to some extent simultaneous aerial surveying to specifically study the spatial extent of the deterrence effects of a seal scarer on harbour porpoises. In order to link porpoise detections at various distances to actual sound levels, sound measurements of the seal scarer signal were carried out at several distances from the source. C-POD recordings revealed a significant deterrence effect on harbour porpoises up to 7.5 km away (at about 113 dB re 1 µParms), much further than previously reported. During seal scarer operation the number of porpoise detections within 750 m of the C-PODs decreased by between 52 and 95% of the value before the seal scarer was activated. An aerial survey revealed a significant decrease in porpoise density from 2.4 porpoises km-2 before to 0.3 porpoises km-2 during seal scarer operation within the 990 km2 study area, showing that the decrease in porpoise detections by passive acoustic monitoring was probably indeed the result of a decrease in porpoise abundance.

An acoustic deterrence device (seal scarer) was used to protect porpoises from hearing loss and bubble curtains were used to attenuate the pile-driving noise. Porpoise occurrence, quantified by echolocation signals, decreased when the seal scarer was engaged, during pile driving and up to 5 h after pile driving stopped. This effect extended out to 12 km, less than the 18-25 km reported from other pile drivings performed without bubble curtains. The bubble curtains thus effectively reduced the temporary habitat loss and risk of hearing loss. The 2 bubble curtains each attenuated the noise by between 7 and 10 dB, when used separately, and 12 dB when used together. Attenuation was most pronounced above 1 kHz, where the pile-driving noise at larger distances was comparable to or lower than ambient noise. This suggests that noise regulation should be based on frequency-weighted sound levels in addition to broadband levels, to assure that mitigation measures are effective in reducing impact on animals and not only in fulfilling legal requirements. The strong reaction to the seal scarer raises concern that it may surpass the reactions to the pile-driving noise itself, when operating with bubble curtains, and calls for a re-evaluation of the specifications of seal scarer sounds.","10.3354/meps12257","CE","CE_8774",230,0.19604894107825,-0.184849606515381,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) are especially at risk because they are relatively small, widely distributed, and often occur in coastal habitats where many types of fishing gear are deployed. It is unknown whether minke whales can detect and avoid ropes associated with fishing gear. To address this question we conducted a series of field experiments to measure behavioral responses of nearshore minke whales to underwater ropes simulating crab and whelk fishing gear. We also investigated correlations between whale behaviors and specific environmental variables. Our methods involved both visual and acoustic monitoring of whale behaviors near experimental ropes and buoys of different colors. A remote sensing system was also used to simultaneously monitor oceanographic conditions, record underwater sounds, and capture underwater video of whales swimming near ropes. Minke whales (N = 42) decreased their swimming velocity and altered their bearing when passing near experimental ropes, especially during trials with white and black ropes. Some minkes (N = 7) also altered their underwater swimming trajectories when passing near ropes, and often appeared to produce low-frequency vocalizations. Collectively this information provides strong evidence that minke whales detect and react behaviorally to the presence of underwater ropes that simulate fishing gear in nearshore areas. We hypothesize that visual and perhaps passive acoustic sensory abilities may be the mechanisms behind these rope avoidance behaviors. We recommend that high contrast ropes (white and black) be used with fishing gear in coastal areas to help minimize entanglements of minke and perhaps other whale species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.jembe.2011.11.018","CE","CE_8775",274,0.17452424401741,-0.0651337574448488,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

The effects of 2 types of pingers (Airmar: 10 kHz tone; Save-Wave Black Saver: 30-160 kHz sweep) on the presence of wild harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, were investigated in 2 areas. Pinger spacing within the areas was similar to that used in commercial fisheries. Two scenarios were tested: (1) pingers were periodically activated and deactivated during 6 periods resembling the deployment and recovery of nets in a gillnet fishery, and (2) pingers were active continuously for 28 d. Acoustic dataloggers (T-PODs) were deployed, 4 within the pinger areas and 3 in control areas, and detected porpoise echolocation activity throughout the entire study. During the periodic-exposure scenario, the porpoise detection rate was reduced by 56% when pingers were active. The reduction was larger for the SaveWave pingers (65%) than for the Airmar pingers (40%). There was a tendency for the encounter rate to increase after the first 2-4 periodic exposures, which could indicate gradual habituation. During the continuous-exposure scenario, the detection rate was reduced by 65% throughout the 28 d with no sign of habituation. In the control areas (2.5, 3 and 5 km distant), neither a decrease nor an increase in detection rate was observed, suggesting that porpoises were displaced either 5 km away.

To investigate whether the re-established reef attracts harbour porpoises, the acoustic activity of porpoises was monitored by static acoustic data loggers, T-PODs, before and after the restoration project. T-PODs were placed at the Laso Trindel reef and at a reference station 10 km away between June and August from 2006 to 2012. Results showed that porpoise activity increased significantly at Laso Trindel reef after the reconstruction in 2008. The number of minutes with porpoise recordings (PPM) increased on average from 9.5 PPM per day in 2006 to a maximum in 2010 (15.2 PPM per day) followed by a small decrease (12.75 PPM per day in 2012). An increase in mean encounter duration from 3.0 min in 2006 to 4.7 min in 2010 (3.7 min in 2012) showed that porpoises not only appeared more often, but also stayed longer at Laso Trindel.

This pattern became increasingly apparent over the study period. At the reference station, in contrast, most activity took place during the day throughout the study.

Depredation in longline pelagic fisheries targeting swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and tuna (Thunnus spp.) involves short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) and some pelagic sharks. Since no long-term solution could be found to date, we investigated fishing gear improvement by deploying a technology designed to physically protect the hooked fish by hiding it to predators: the DMD (depredation mitigation device). Two types of DMDs were designed: ""spiders"" and ""socks"". The efficiency of ""spiders"" was tested in November 2007 during a fishing trial of 26 longline fishing operations when 12,480 hooks and 1970 devices were set. The efficiency of ""socks"" was tested in October 2008 during a fishing trial of 32 longline fishing operations when 13,220 hooks and 339 devices were set. 117 and 24 fish were hooked on branchlines equipped with spiders and socks, respectively and among those devices, 87.3% versus 69.2% were correctly triggered and 80% versus 15% of the fish were correctly protected. A low entanglement rate of the spiders with the fishing gear was found (3.6%), but a higher one was associated to the socks (17.8%). Operational constraints to routinely deploy ""spiders"" were examined. The number of sets impacted by shark depredation was significantly greater than the number of sets involving toothed whale depredation. However, when depredation occurred, the proportion of fish damaged by toothed whales was significantly greater. While more trials should be carried out to deeply verify the efficiency of DMDs, we remain convinced that considerations of fishing gear technologies might be more actively investigated to propose innovative measures to mitigate toothed whale depredation in pelagic longlining.

There were few significant differences in the size of both sharks and bycatch in the two gear types, apart from significantly smaller (p < 0.05) tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier being taken on drumlines and smaller green turtles Chelonia mydas in nets. Catch per unit effort showed orders of magnitude differences among species, even within the same family. Hammerhead sharks and rays were particularly vulnerable to net capture, whereas higher catch rates of tiger sharks were observed for drumlines. Nets caught more marine mammals, teleost fish and rays, whereas drumlines exhibited higher catch rates of the threatened loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta. Survival of most taxa (particularly obligate ram ventilators) was lower in nets than drumlines. Bycatch species (turtles and marine mammals) were able to swim to the surface to breathe when they were hooked on drumlines, enhancing their survival potential.

Weinvestigated depredation by Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) in the hand-jig squid fishery around the Azores to determine the factors that may influence depredation behaviour and impacts on the fishery, and conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of acoustic deterrent devices. Monitoring of the interaction between dolphins and the fishery was carried out through interviews with fishers and observations made from fishing vessels. Depredation was reported in 50% of the 506 interviews conducted from 2009 to 2011 and Risso's dolphins were reportedly responsible for 92% of the depredation events. Risso's dolphin depredation was recorded in 33% of the observed fishing trips (n = 96). Generalized additive models revealed that depth, sea surface temperature, and fishing time were important factors affecting depredation probability. Generalized linear models showed that fishing time also influenced the number of squids depredated, with greater catch losses predicted as duration of the fishing events increased. Depredation rate was calculated at 3% yielding an estimate of 8-12 t of squid lost to dolphins per year and an annual economic loss of 50 000 for the squid fishery of S. Miguel. The use of pingers had no significant effect on the catch per unit effort of squids. Depredation rates were similar for the control (0.20), inactive (0.19), and active (0.19) pinger conditions. Models indicated no significant effect of pinger brand and condition on cetacean depredation.

Between 1990 and 2009, data on fishing gear, environmental variables, and bycatch were recorded for over 8,000 fishing sets by at-sea fishery observers, including over 4,000 sets outfitted with acoustic pingers between 1996 and 2009. Bycatch rates of cetaceans in sets with =30 pingers were nearly 50% lower compared to sets without pingers (p = 1.2 × 10 -6), though this result is driven largely by common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) bycatch. Beaked whales have not been observed entangled in this fishery since 1995, the last full year of fishing without acoustic pingers. Pinger failure (=1 nonfunctioning pingers in a net) was noted in 3.7% of observed sets. In sets where the number of failed pingers was recorded, approximately 18% of deployed pingers had failed. Cetacean bycatch rates were 10 times higher in sets where =1 pingers failed versus sets without pinger failure (p = 0.002), though sample sizes for sets with pinger failure were small. No evidence of habituation to pingers by cetaceans was apparent over a 14-year period of use. Bycatch rates of California sea lions in sets with =30 pingers were nearly double that of sets without pingers, which prompted us to examine the potential ""dinner bell"" effects of pingers. Depredation of swordfish catch by California sea lions was not linked to pinger use-the best predictors of depredation were total swordfish catch, month fished, area fished, and nighttime use of deck lights on vessels.","10.4031/MTSJ.45.5.3","CE","CE_8794",241,0.178458021439547,-0.0430151462036869,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Non-lethal management tools such as acoustic devices show highly varying success and often pose a conservation risk due to noise pollution and habitat degradation. We tested the long-term effectiveness of a deterrence system which harnesses an autonomous reflex (startle) to selectively inflict avoidance responses in a target species (phocid seals) by emitting band-limited noise pulses with sharp onset times. Seal predation was monitored at a marine salmon farm (test site) over a full production cycle (19 month) with a multi-transducer deterrent system deployed for the final year. Predation was also monitored for several months at two control sites and additional short-term tests were carried out at sites which suffered higher predation rates. Generalized linear (mixed) models revealed that sound exposure caused a 91% reduction in lost fish when comparing predation levels within the test site and 97% when comparing the test site against both control sites. Similarly, sound exposure led to a 93% reduction in the number of fish lost due to seal damage at a short-term test site. Visual monitoring of marine mammals around the long-term test site showed that the number of seal surfacings within 100 m from the loudspeakers was only slightly lower during sound exposure. Harbour porpoise and otter distribution around the farm was not affected by sound exposure. By adjusting the frequency composition of startle stimuli, our method has the potential to provide solutions for managing humanwildlife conflicts in terrestrial and marine habitats by selectively deterring target species.","10.1111/acv.12248","CE","CE_8801",259,0.126111397828624,-0.0834840595912472,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

We used data from skippers' logbooks and independent observers to assess common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) bycatch patterns between 2003 and 2009 in the Pilbara Trawl Fishery, Western Australia. Both datasets indicated that dolphins were caught in all fishery areas, across all depths and throughout the year. Over the entire datasets, observer reported bycatch rates (n = 52 dolphins in 4,124 trawls, or 12.6 dolphins/1,000 trawls) were ca. double those reported by skippers (n = 180 dolphins in 27,904 trawls, or 6.5 dolphins/1,000 trawls). Generalised Linear Models based on observer data, which better explained the variation in dolphin bycatch, indicated that the most significant predictors of dolphin catch were: (1) vessel - one trawl vessel caught significantly more dolphins than three others assessed; (2) time of day - the lowest dolphin bycatch rates were between 00:00 and 05:59; and (3) whether nets included bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) - the rate was reduced by ca. 45%, from 18.8 to 10.3 dolphins/1,000 trawls, after their introduction. These results indicated that differences among vessels (or skippers' trawling techniques) and dolphin behavior (a diurnal pattern) influenced the rates of dolphin capture; and that spatial or seasonal adjustments to trawling effort would be unlikely to significantly reduce dolphin bycatch. Recent skipper's logbook data show that dolphin bycatch rates have not declined since those reported in 2006, when BRDs were introduced across the fishery. Modified BRDs, with top-opening escape hatches from which dolphins might escape to the surface, may be a more effective means of further reducing dolphin bycatch. The vulnerability of this dolphin population to trawling-related mortality cannot be assessed in the absence of an ongoing observer program and without information on trawler-associated dolphin community size, broader dolphin population size and connectivity with adjacent populations. © 2014 Allen et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0093178","CE","CE_8810",288,0.193164084203592,0.128979293406745,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

A total of 90.7 h were spent in direct observation of 55 groups of bottlenose dolphins along the north-eastern coast of Sardinia (Italy). Activation of the AHD did not have a significant and immediate effect on bottlenose dolphins' presence, distance from the AHD, group size or time spent in the fish farm area. The AHD alone did not effectively deter bottlenose dolphins, particularly when other motivating factors, such as food, were present.

Mark-recapture methods were used to estimate annual abundance within the SAC from 1990 to 2010.

This study evaluates the social and ecological outcomes of the newly created fisheries co-management system in Tam Giang Lagoon, Vietnam. The data was gathered from six fishing communities and included a survey (n= 252), 12 focus groups and 12 in-depth interviews with fishers and 15 in-depth interviews with resource managers, policy makers, co-management experts and practitioners. The study investigates the social and ecological changes associated with the presence of the co-management system. Although there was insufficient evidence to conclude that there was an increase in fish yield in the lagoon since co-management commenced in the mid-2000s, there was a measurable improvement in fish stocks with no further collapse in the lagoon fishery. The presence of co-management has contributed to a considerable reduction in the violation of regulations and conflict between lagoon resources users. However, these positive social and ecological outcomes were reported only in some parts of the lagoon. The study indicated that if compliance with the regulations is not achieved, and especially if the number of Chinese Lu (a bottom fishing trap) is not controlled effectively, fishery degradation may recur in the future. Consistency in the co-management system and improvements in government policies and practices in support of the community in handling violators and enforcing regulations, are vital for the future of the lagoon system.","10.1016/j.fishres.2015.09.013","CE","CE_8825",246,0.280296996073777,0.195824612017906,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
8826,2019,"Managing hedgerows for nocturnal wildlife: do bats and their insect prey benefit from targeted agri-environment schemes?","Journal of Applied Ecology","Mitigating the detrimental impacts of intensive farming on biodiversity requires the implementation of cost-effective conservation actions. Targeted agri-environment schemes (AESs) to enhance populations of threatened species inhabiting farmland have been proposed for this purpose, yet their effectiveness for nocturnal wildlife remains unknown. We assessed whether hedgerow management prescribed by targeted AESs to improve habitat conditions for the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) in England may positively influence the species, the entire bat assemblage and the insect prey of bats. We specifically investigated the responses of bats (occurrence, activity and species richness) and insects (biomass, abundance and diversity) to time since last trimming (from 1 up to 10 years). We explored the mechanisms underlying the effects of AES via changes in trimming regime on bats. Moreover, we investigated the effects of landscape context on bats as we expected that highly mobile species would benefit further from landscape-scale management. Bat species richness significantly increased with time since last trimming. Three bat taxa of major conservation concern in Western Europe substantially benefited from the targeted prescription, namely R. ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Plecotus spp. Insect family richness and dipteran abundance were also significantly greater at hedgerows that were untrimmed for at least 3 years. The activity of more common bat species (i.e. pipistrelle bats) was not influenced by time since last trimming. Changes in trimming regime strongly affected hedgerow height which directly and indirectly (by increasing prey abundance) influenced bat occurrence, activity and species richness along hedgerows. The activity of highly mobile bat species was mainly associated with a range of landscape attributes. The amount of semi-natural grassland within 0.5 km of the sampling sites positively influenced R. ferrumequinum while the presence of urban areas negatively affected light-sensitive bat species. Synthesis and applications. The implementation of targeted agri-environment schemes can include effective measures to enhance bats and their insect prey in farmland. Although we highlight the success of current prescriptions on hedgerow management, we suggest that their effectiveness can easily be optimized by encouraging farmers to keep hedgerows untrimmed for longer periods (>3 up to 10 years). We also highlight that a multi-scale management approach is required to successfully promote bats in farmland.","10.1111/1365-2664.13412","CE","CE_8826",362,0.262904024981153,0.316373058289767,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

School shark (Galeorhinus galeus) have suffered significant stock declines in Australia; however, recent stock assessments suggest the population may have stabilized and the protection of closed nursery areas has been identified as a key management strategy to rebuilding their numbers. Young-of-The-year (YOY) and juvenile G. galeus were acoustically tagged and monitored to determine ontogenetic differences in residency and seasonal use of an important protected nursery area (Shark Refuge Area or SRA) in southeastern Tasmania. BothYOYand juvenile G. galeus showed a distinct seasonal pattern of occurrence in the SRAwith most departing the area during winter and only a small proportion of YOY (33%) and no juveniles returning the following spring, suggesting areas outside the SRA may also be important during these early life-history stages. While these behaviors confirm SRAs continue to function as essential habitat during G. galeus early life history, evidence of YOY and juveniles emigrating from these areas within their first 1-2 years and the fact that few YOY return suggest that these areas may only afford protection for a more limited amount of time than previously thought. Determining the importance of neighbouring coastal waters and maintaining the use of traditional fisheries management tools are therefore required to ensure effective conservation of G. galeus during early life history.","10.1093/icesjms/fsv079","CE","CE_8831",236,0.410973663554387,0.298876367983004,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Roads also affect bats, acting as barriers to movements and causing direct mortality by collisions with vehicles. Among wildlife crossing structures existing to maintain landscape connectivity, road underpasses are considered as one of the most effective conservation measure for bats. While a few studies assessed the effects of underpass attributes on bat use, none to date has assessed the impact of landscape context on underpass use and attractiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we monitored bat activity during three consecutive nights around 24 underpasses selected along a gradient of forest cover. We compared bat activity below and above underpasses (i.e., underpass use), at road sections with and without underpasses and at habitats adjacent to roads (i.e., underpass attractiveness). We found a significant positive effect of forest cover on both underpass use and attractiveness for Myotis spp. and Barbastella barbastellus, and significant negative effects of distance to the nearest forest patch for Rhinolophus spp. and hedgerow length for Myotis spp. Our study highlights the key influence of landscape context on road underpass efficiency to maintain landscape connectivity for bats.

Agri-environment schemes are advocated as the key government-funded mechanism to restore biodiversity, but evidence for their effects has been mixed. We examined the response of six bat species to Tir Gofal (TG), a Welsh AES that operated from 1999 to 2011. A large-scale multi-site study compared bat activity and key habitat variables on TG farms paired with control farms not in the scheme. Observations were made over three years (2009 to 2011) using three types of bat detector survey. Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, Myotis daubentonii, Rhinolophus hipposideros and R. ferrumequinum showed similar overall and foraging activity on TG and control farms (occurrence, intensity of activity where present). Occurrence of Nyctalus noctula and Nyctalus group was also similar on both farm types, but where they were present, the intensity of their activity was higher on control farms. The lack of influence of TG status on bat activity may reflect the close similarity in occurrence and condition of many key habitats on the two farm types and should be seen in the context of a mainly traditional extensively farmed landscape. Habitat prescriptions may have been insufficiently mature, implemented at too low density or lacking roosting provision to stimulate a species response, or may have had greater impact in a more intensively farmed landscape where less high quality bat habitat was available. A more targeted approach to creating and enhancing field and landscape scale roosting, foraging and commuting resources may be needed to effect positive responses in bat populations.","10.1016/j.agee.2018.12.011","CE","CE_8838",267,0.253910728070269,0.174244635339378,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
8839,2019,"A smart curtailment approach for reducing bat fatalities and curtailment time at wind energy facilities","Ecological Applications","The development and expansion of wind energy is considered a key global threat to bat populations. Bat carcasses are being found underneath wind turbines across North and South America, Eurasia, Africa, and the Austro-Pacific. However, relatively little is known about the comparative impacts of techniques designed to modify turbine operations in ways that reduce bat fatalities associated with wind energy facilities. This study tests a novel approach for reducing bat fatalities and curtailment time at a wind energy facility in the United States, then compares these results to operational mitigation techniques used at other study sites in North America and Europe. The study was conducted in Wisconsin during 2015 using a new system of tools for analyzing bat activity and wind speed data to make near real-time curtailment decisions when bats are detected in the area at control turbines (N = 10) vs. treatment turbines (N = 10). The results show that this smart curtailment approach (referred to as Turbine Integrated Mortality Reduction, TIMR) significantly reduced fatality estimates for treatment turbines relative to control turbines for pooled species data, and for each of five species observed at the study site: pooled data (84.5%); eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis, 82.5%); hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus, 81.4%); silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans, 90.9%); big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus, 74.2%); and little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus, 91.4%). The approach reduced power generation and estimated annual revenue at the wind energy facility by = 3.2% for treatment turbines relative to control turbines, and we estimate that the approach would have reduced curtailment time by 48% relative to turbines operated under a standard curtailment rule used in North America. This approach significantly reduced fatalities associated with all species evaluated, each of which has broad distributions in North America and different ecological affinities, several of which represent species most affected by wind development in North America. While we recognize that this approach needs to be validated in other areas experiencing rapid wind energy development, we anticipate that this approach has the potential to significantly reduce bat fatalities in other ecoregions and with other bat species assemblages in North America and beyond.","10.1002/eap.1881","CE","CE_8839",342,0.141752778742477,-0.031291878294404,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

We investigated the effectiveness of a bat box program designed to partially offset tree hollow loss from clearing for a coal mine. During the first year of monitoring, we detected bats in 5% of 1,308 box checks. Only 3 of 13 local tree cavity-roosting bat species/species groups used boxes and occupancy was not strongly associated with modeled box and site attributes. In the second year, we tested two hypotheses that may explain the relatively low box use: (1) solar exposure of boxes was inadequate for heterothermic bats and (2) available box designs were of low suitability. Relocating boxes to increase solar exposure did not increase use, or enhance the temperature profiles of relocated boxes. Introduction of a new box design led to 11 times higher use compared with existing designs for Nyctophilus spp. (long-eared bat). Overall, our data suggest that the bat box program was ineffective due to few bat species using boxes, infrequent box use by three species, and rarity of maternity roosting. The knowledge gap of species-specific box designs and roosting ecology limits the effectiveness of boxes to offset cleared hollow-bearing trees. Lack of knowledge and the widespread use of bat boxes to offset lost tree hollows highlights the need to (1) rigorously protect hollow-bearing trees and (2) advance our understanding of species-specific roost ecology, box design preferences and mechanical hollow creation into trees, before artificial hollows can be considered a meaningful offset measure.","10.1111/rec.12919","CE","CE_8840",250,0.14572838480904,-0.000580423410787696,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Two of the three methods used, installing plastic flags and ringing bells in the trees, were derived from those used by litchi growers in the southeast. We improved and standardized these methods and compared their effectiveness with an organic product made from dried blood and vegetable oil (Plantskydd®) with a taste and odour aimed at deterring mammal feeding. The bats damaged from 440-7,040 g of litchi fruits per tree and two of the three methods reduced the fruit lost to bats: the plastic flags and the organic deterrent. There were significant differences in the damage levels between the study sites and between our three methods of deterrence. The plastic flags and bell ringing methods were significantly less effective in reducing the fruit bat damage compared to the taste deterrent. The latter was most effective when it had enough time to dry and adhere to the fruits after spraying and before rain. Its effectiveness was further demonstrated in flight cage experiments during which Rousettus madagascariensis avoided litchis treated with Plantskydd®. Analysis of bat faecal samples revealed no feeding preference but the collected samples contained large numbers of Ficus seeds, suggesting that the bats feed extensively on Ficus fruits rather than on fruit of economic importance.

However, the potential benefits of AES to non-target groups such as bats are unclear. In the study presented here, we assessed how the vegetative characteristics (e.g. dicot coverage and bare ground coverage) of four commonly employed AES habitat types influenced the occurrence and activity of bats. AES plots were monitored using static acoustic bat detectors and each plot was surveyed three times between April and September, with detectors set to record over three consecutive nights during each survey. Analysis of this data identified some preferences for specific AES habitat characteristics by bats, but preferences differed between species. Relationships between bats and AES habitat type were not investigated due to structural similarities between habitats which were identified through principal component analysis. Our study therefore identifies simple species-specific habitat management practices which could be implemented as part of current AES to increase the suitability of these habitats to bats. For example, habitat management targeted towards Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Barbastellus barbastellus could focus on providing floristically diverse foraging sites, which are attractive to their invertebrate prey, in close proximity to potential woodland roost sites, whilst Pipistrellus pipistrellus may benefit from AES with high dicot coverage if such habitats are located along tall field boundaries with trees, which provide shelter for their prey.","10.1016/j.baae.2019.09.002","CE","CE_8843",231,0.234997306795882,0.160474441608344,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

We divided 10 clutches in halves, reburied them, and exposed them to 1 of 2 treatments. At emergence, 7 clutches met minimum criteria for inclusion in the study. One halfclutch received only ambient rainfall (""dry"" treatment) while the other half-clutch received ambient rainfall plus daily watering (""wet"" treatment). Data loggers were used to record incubation temperatures in both groups. Hatchlings were captured at emergence and laboratoryreared over a period of ~ 3 mo. Mass, straight carapace length (SCL), and straight carapace width (SCW) were measured weekly to track growth. Initial measurements were larger for turtles from the wet nests in all metrics. Turtles from wet nests grew more in SCW than turtles from dry nests. Turtle growth from the 2 treatments did not differ in SCL or mass measurements. Larger initial sizes and faster SCW growth may enable the turtles to more quickly achieve a refuge size from their gape-limited predators. Moisture availability during nesting season is projected to decrease based on climate change models. If that change materializes, it could negatively affect hatchling sizes and neonate growth rates, survival, and hence the recovery of this imperiled species.","10.2744/CCB-1301.1","CE","CE_9799",239,0.351050942702815,0.226043450178724,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

In 2013, at least 13% of green turtle (Chelonia mydas) and 25% of hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) nests were lost to domestic dog predation on Playa Norte, Costa Rica. In 2014 and 2015, plastic and bamboo protective screens were deployed to protect nests. Screens were deployed at different stages of the incubation period and the success of the nests analyzed. Predation rates increased as the seasons progressed with October and November being the peak depredation months, as well as the peak for hatchling emergences. Eggs remaining in nests that had been partially depredated had a significantly lower percentage of hatching success than eggs in undisturbed nests. There was no significant difference between timing of deployment and likelihood of a screen being breached. The likelihood of a screen being breached was highly dependent on the type of material used; bamboo screens were ca. 153% more effective than plastic and successfully prevented the complete predation of ca. 48% of nests. Bamboo screening is an inexpensive, environmentally inert, yet labor-intensive method for reducing nest depredation by domestic dogs. This screening method does not impact the hatching or emerging success of the nest.","10.2744/CCB-1316.1","CE","CE_9802",201,0.299944678980597,0.234160232035444,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The primary conservation education program has been an annual Sea Turtle Camp Program that was developed and initiated in 2007 with the goal of engaging and educating youth in the conservation of sea turtle species. In 2015 and 2016, the SKSTMN performed an assessment of this education program. The outcome assessment included 1) evaluation of pre-and postparticipation tests for the 2015 and 2016 participants, 2) comparison with a control group of nonparticipants who took the posttest, and 3) a survey of former participants and their parents or guardians. The pre/post exercise was performed to determine if students were gaining and retaining information during the Sea Turtle Camp Program and if participants had a stronger knowledge base than nonparticipants. The survey of former participants was performed to determine if this program had positively affected participants and their perceptions regarding sea turtles, the marine environment, and conservation; to ascertain strengths and weaknesses of the Sea Turtle Camp Program; and to identify conservation education areas that could be further developed. The results obtained for participants in the Sea Turtle Camp Program between the pre-and posttests indicated that the educational modalities used are successfully relaying the desired information and that the majority of the participants are retaining this information throughout the Sea Turtle Camp Program. Additionally, the results on the pre-and posttests for the Sea Turtle Camp Program participant group vs. the control group of nonparticipants indicate that the Program had a significant impact on participants' knowledge regarding sea turtle natural history, biology, and St. Kitts-specific sea turtle issues. Findings indicated that there were positive changes in behavior toward the marine environment and sea turtles in Sea Turtle Camp participants following participation and that there was a need for additional curriculum to be developed to accommodate former participants who were interested in continuing their participation in the program.","10.2744/CCB-1300.1","CE","CE_9803",329,0.248905465213132,0.314494365189626,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Although bog turtles (Glyptemys muhlenbergii) do not typically leave their wetlands for nesting, nest-site selection can impact hatching success and hatchling survival. Between 1974 and 2012, we monitored the fates of 258 bog turtle eggs incubated in the field and 91 eggs incubated under laboratory conditions from 11 different bogs, fens, or wetland complexes in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Laboratory-incubated eggs exhibited the greatest hatching success (81%), but we did not detect a significant difference in hatching success between nests protected with predator excluder cages (43%) and unprotected nests (33%). However, we found significantly lower predation rates in protected nests, suggesting that while predator excluder cages successfully reduced predation, other environmental factors persisted to reduce egg survival in the field. Natural hatching success was potentially reduced by poor weather conditions, which may have resulted in embryo developmental problems, dehydration, or embryos drowning in the egg. Our results suggest that egg depredation, coupled with embryo developmental problems and infertility, are limiting factors to hatching success in our study populations. Using predator excluder cages to protect bog turtle eggs in the field, or incubating eggs in the laboratory and releasing hatchlings at original nesting areas, may be an effective conservation tool for recovering populations of this federally threatened species.","10.2744/CCB-1237.1","CE","CE_9804",215,0.292488504306925,0.23013494114406,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

An estimated 250,000 loggerhead (Caretta caretta ) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) sea turtles are taken each year as incidental catch by the pelagic longline fishing industry. Studies have examined various deterrents for their potential to repel sea turtles from the vicinity of fishing operations; visual deterrents such as shark models/silhouettes and gillnet illumination have shown the most promise. However, given the difficulty of directly observing sea turtle behavior in the wild, laboratory trials are crucial for characterizing the sea turtle response to shark models. The present study examined the response of 42 captive-reared juvenile loggerhead sea turtles to a shark model in a controlled laboratory setting. Loggerheads exhibited defensive behavior toward the shark model, taking significantly more time to bite squid bait beneath the shark model than that for squid beneath a control object (sphere) and bare squid. Also, the turtles approached the shark model less often and exhibited more defensive carapace turns toward the shark model. Although the shark model in this study elicited avoidance behavior in loggerhead sea turtles, further research is needed to identify plausible applications, which would reduce sea turtle bycatch while maintaining target fish catch rates. It may be possible to develop a ""Children's Day Koinobori kite"" (a three-dimensional kite) in the shape of a shark that would unfurl and ""fly"" underwater and could possibly clip to main or float lines in commercial fisheries.","10.2744/CCB-1110.1","CE","CE_9812",240,0.5293943503999,-0.35379910667579,"250","negative","negative_250",0

All adult and juvenile tortoises monitored with temperature loggers survived overwintering; however, during the course of the study 2 translocated juvenile tortoises without temperature loggers died during winter months. Onset and termination of overwintering were not different between the 2 yrs and were not correlated with mean above-ground air temperature. Mean overwinter duration was 127±9 d SD and 128±13 d SD during 2002-2003 and 2004-2005, respectively. Tortoises experienced temperatures as low as 7°C and as high as 31°C while overwintering; however, most (12 of 15) tortoises experienced very little (<1°C) mean daily temperature fluctuation despite air temperatures regularly dropping below 0°C and exceeding 20°C.

Nesting and hatching data are reported here for the first 30 yrs of the research and conservation project. Because of intense nest relocation and conservation efforts, the population initially showed a steady increase in numbers, with the most dramatic rise occurring between 1997 and 2001. In spite of continued efforts, however, this recovery began to stall in the decade from 2000 to 2010. Analysis of nesting data, including specific reproductive parameters such as recruitment rate, remigration interval, and productivity (number of nests laid, hatching success) during this time frame, in conjunction with historical data, provided an opportunity to assess the contribution of these factors to the population dynamics at Sandy Point. Annual reproductive data demonstrated that regardless of overall nesting numbers, odd years consistently exhibited higher nesting numbers (115.6±18.58) than even years (68.4±7.63) (p<0.01). The average annual remigration interval increased over the study period with a record high of 3.41±0.18 yrs observed in 2008. A steady decline in average nests laid was observed (R2=0.84) between 1992 and 2010, with a record low of 3.60±2.16 nests per turtle in 2010. Hatching success varied over the 30-yr period from a project low of 40.28%±23.20% in 2005 to a record high of 67.80%±20.31% in 1991. Mean overall hatching success for the first 30 yrs of the project was 58.50%±7.75%. Hatching success declined over the course of the project, and the number of hatchlings produced per turtle declined in the 2000s. These factors contributed to a decrease in population productivity and may ultimately have inhibited continued population growth. Over the study period, a stable percentage of remigrants continued to nest at Sandy Point. However, a decreased number and percentage of neophytes was observed, suggesting either a delayed or a decreased recruitment, possibly due to increased age to sexual maturity, an increased mortality of early life stages, or a change in food resources at foraging grounds. These results suggest a population that has slowed growth and that may begin to decline in the future. Further research needs to be conducted to understand possible maternal, physiological, and environmental factors that are impacting these reproductive parameters and, ultimately, affecting the population dynamics at SPNWR.","10.2744/CCB-1224.1","CE","CE_9828",365,0.195698851559295,0.189633294098769,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Ninety-five percent of the natural nests in unswept control areas (n = 20) and all of the nests in swept treatment areas (n = 16) were depredated by raccoons within 24 hrs.

However, artificial facsimiles of the surface markings left by nesting turtles, lacking cavities, were disturbed less frequently (26%, n = 19). Findings suggest that broom sweeping was ineffective because the location cues used by raccoons to find newly constructed nests are not primarily visual but olfactory and related to soil profile disturbance, possibly via the microbial metabolite geosmin.","10.2744/ccab-14-01-64-72.1","CE","CE_9829",180,0.205250834707318,-0.0922884910869297,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Although substantial research has focused on the effect of the temperature during this canonical TSP, the effect of temperatures experienced before this time (pre-TSP) on the onset and duration of the TSP is less understood. Here, we incubated eggs of the endangered Magdalena River turtle, Podocnemis lewyana, under 3 relatively constant temperatures and 6 shift-twice treatments. Constant treatments included two 100% masculinizing temperatures that fostered a relatively slower and faster embryo development and one 100% feminizing temperature. The shift treatments included a masculinizing temperature and later a feminizing temperature for a period of time at different incubation stages. Sex ratios were determined by a geometric-morphometric sexing approach developed for this species and validated by gonadal histology. This technique is a nonlethal sexing alternative; thus, it contributes to the conservation of this endangered species. The sex ratios obtained under constant temperatures were more feminized than the sex ratio of another population native to a warmer climate. Shift-twice experiments revealed that pre-TSP temperatures affected the duration of the TSP and as such influenced sex determination. Specifically, at 29°C pre-TSP, the TSP lasted 20 d (28% of the incubation period), whereas at 31°C pre-TSP, the TSP was extended for 30 d (52% of the incubation period). An approximation of developmental stages based on the congeneric Podocnemis expansa is provided.

Not all efforts have been successful. For the threatened Agassiz's desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), one challenge to recovery is poor recruitment of juveniles into adult populations, and this is being addressed through headstart programs. We evaluated 8 cohorts of juvenile desert tortoises from 1 to 8 yrs old in a headstart program at Edwards Air Force Base, California, for health, behavior, and growth. We also examined capacities of the headstart pens. Of 148 juveniles evaluated for health, 99.3% were below a prime condition index; 14.9% were lethargic and unresponsive; 59.5% had protruding spinal columns and associated concave scutes; 29.1% had evidence of ant bites; and 14.2% had moderate to severe injuries to limbs or shell. Lifetime growth rates for juveniles 1-8 yrs of age were approximately two times less than growth rates reported for wild populations. Tortoises in older cohorts had higher growth rates, and models indicated that high density in pens and burrow sharing negatively affected growth rates. Densities of tortoises in pens (205-2042/ha) were 350-3500 times higher than the average density recorded in the wild (<1/ha) for tortoises of similar sizes. The predominant forage species available to juveniles were alien annual grasses, which are nutritionally inadequate for growth. We conclude that the headstart pens were of inadequate size, likely contained too few shelters, and lacked the necessary biomass of preferred forbs to sustain the existing population. Additional factors to consider for future reptilian headstart pens include vegetative cover, food sources, soil seed banks, and soil composition.","10.2744/CCB-1248.1","CE","CE_9833",249,0.201269360744825,-0.0555450418298723,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Relocation can alter the incubation environment, so there is concern regarding potential modifications to embryonic development. Several studies have explored the effects of relocation on nest productivity; however, these studies often only compare reproductive output and incubation environments between relocated and in situ nests without accounting for the incubating environment of the original nest location. We assessed the differences in sand temperature, inundation exposure, grain size, and moisture content between the original and final locations of relocated nests at a loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nesting beach in Fort Morgan, Alabama, as well as differences in nest productivity between in situ and relocated nests. Differences in mean sand temperature, likelihood of inundation, and sand moisture between original-relocated locations and in situ-relocated nests were not significant. Emergence success was significantly lower in relocated vs. in situ nests, and sand grain distributions were significantly different between original and relocated nest locations. Given that relocation did not improve nest productivity nor reduce the likelihood of inundation, this practice conferred minimal net benefit to sea turtle nests on dissipative-to-intermediate beach conditions typical of the northern Gulf of Mexico. To improve the justification for nest relocation under these beach conditions, a better understanding of embryonic tolerance to inundation and clarification of relocation criteria and guidelines is required.","10.2744/CCB-1306.1","CE","CE_9836",239,0.263109362299049,0.186224947741183,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Thus, in the short term, it is important to evaluate the acclimation of reintroduced individuals in order to assess the potential success of the project. In this study, we radio-tracked 30 European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) reintroduced in the Estagnol Nature Reserve (southern France) in 2008 and 2009. We analyzed each individual's dispersal over the site, its home range, and its pattern of displacement for 2 yrs after its release. About 80% of the released animals were still detected on the site 8 mo after the release operation. Home-range size was highly variable among individuals but was typical of what is known for the species. Home ranges were, however, larger in the first year after release than in the following year, probably because individuals explored the site immediately after release. The released individuals exhibited a typical displacement pattern over the first year, with a larger displacement during spring and summer that was earlier for males (April-May) than for females (June-September). All of these results strongly indicate the success of the acclimation phase of the reintroduction operation. To evaluate the success of reintroduction programs of long-lived species, we recommend, in addition to a long-term demographic study, a fine-scale study of space-use modalities, which allows the assessment of the acclimation phase of the individuals at the new site in the short term.

But prior to 1968, its green turtles suffered intense exploitation documented by trade statistics, historical literature, and a scientific study in 1927. Three population surveys conducted just before, during, and shortly after 1968 provide baseline data by which to assess the long-term population recovery monitored since 1980 using a standardized track count protocol. The 52 nesting beaches distributed along the 83-km outer rim of Aldabra were classified into 6 beach groups (WGT, SETT, DDM, DJL, CC, and North), with total beach length of 5.2 km. During Phase 1 (19801994) of the study, 17 index beaches (WGT #117) were monitored 4 times per month and other beaches opportunistically. During Phase 2 (19942008), index beaches (WGT #122 and SETT) were monitored at least 4 times per month and remote beaches monthly. Track counts were converted to estimated egg clutch production using nesting success data.

Although upland pine-dominated habitats have received much attention, few studies have examined tortoises in nearby coastal beach dune habitats. To examine the distribution and abundance of gopher tortoises in northeast Florida coastal habitats, comprehensive burrow surveys were conducted 3 times during the last 8 yrs on 2 separate gopher tortoise populations near St. Augustine, Florida. The objectives for these surveys were to 1) examine changes in population size and structure in representative upland and coastal dune habitats and 2) describe the response of gopher tortoises to land management practices (i.e., prescribed fire). Total burrow density within the upland population remained stable over the 3 surveys (0.68 burrows/ha in 2005, 0.66 burrows/ha in 2007, and 0.64 burrows/ha in 2011). Burrow densities in the burned areas of the upland habitat increased in areas that were burned at least once since the time of the first survey in 2005 but decreased in areas that were infrequently burned or remained unburned. Burrow density on the beach dunes, however, greatly increased between the most recent 2 surveys (3.63 burrows/ha in 2007 and 8.95 burrows/ha in 2011), possibly attributable to an increased use of a relatively confined habitat, or sampling biases by surveyors. Three different correction factor methods were used to determine gopher tortoise population estimates for each of the surveys, providing a range of estimates. The results of this study and the few others focused on coastal beach dunes suggest that this vulnerable, yet important, habitat should receive more attention because some of the highest gopher tortoise burrow densities have been observed there. © 2014 Chelonian Research Foundation.","10.2744/CCB-1053.1","CE","CE_9865",269,0.184274393096575,0.218260096474025,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

An open fishing season for sea turtles is active in St. Kitts and Nevis from 1 October through 28 February annually. In 2006, sea turtle fishers in St. Kitts were assessed by the SKSTMN through a survey process to determine the status of sea turtle stocks in the St. Kitts area and to determine the feasibility of developing a local community-based ecotourism project focusing on sea turtles. Based on the results of this survey, the SKSTMN made the decision to develop alternative livelihoods for the fishers to serve as a replacement for the harvest. These included a Sea Turtle Technician Program and a St. Kitts Leatherback Ecotour Package. Prior to the development and implementation of the St. Kitts Leatherback Ecotour Package, a representative survey was prepared and distributed to 3 target groups: local citizens, tourists, and residents. A complete tour package was developed according to the survey results, and the package was offered during leatherback nesting seasons from 2009 to 2014. In 2014, an outcome assessment of the ecotourism initiative was conducted that consisted of electronic survey delivery to a subset of former ecotour participants.

A total of more than 251,000 hatchlings were released into the wild as a part of the project; however, its contribution to the recent increase in nesting females is not well understood. The increase in nesting females may be attributed to the temporary suspension of the turtle harvest and reduction of catch from 1942 to 1968, which allowed for stable production of hatchlings from natural beaches.

Thermal regimes during embryogenesis might therefore have direct consequences on fitness, potentially even shaping population trajectories. These effects are likely strongest in short-lived species where even temporary temperature-induced differences in body size or shape might have adaptive significance. We investigated the effects of incubation temperature on the body size and shape of hatchling Australian Painted Dragons (Ctenophorus pictus). Eggs incubated at low temperature required a longer incubation period, but produced hatchlings of greater body mass. However, no effect of temperature was found on the structural dimensions of hatchlings. These results might be explained by an increased absorption of water by the developing embryo during the prolonged incubation period. A greater water content might increase early-life desiccation tolerance in this short-lived lizard inhabiting arid and semiarid environments. Egg mass, however, had the strongest effect on hatchling phenotype, with larger eggs producing larger hatchlings. Furthermore, there was a seasonal effect on yolk allocation, with eggs laid earlier being larger than those laid later. Our results indicate that yolk allocation is the most important factor affecting hatchling phenotype in this species, while temperature mainly affects embryo developmental rate and likely has an indirect effect on hatchling water content.","10.1655/HERPETOLOGICA-D-17-00052.1","CE","CE_9959",231,0.172875535445608,0.14572500882681,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

When compared, only the snout-vent length and mass of neonates, averaged for each litter, did not change throughout the birth season. The temporal variation in neonate body condition found in the two species could explain increased offspring survival when neonates face challenging environmental conditions.

Freshwater turtles are considered to be susceptible species since their development is dependent on incubation temperature. In Thailand, although several species of freshwater turtle are present, the extent of their susceptibility to temperature change is unknown due to the lack of information on their developmental patterns. This research, therefore, is aimed at examining the effects of temperature on somatic development in Malayemys macrocephala, a native species and the most common freshwater turtle in Thailand. Turtle eggs were collected from rice fields in the central part of Thailand during December 2011 to February 2012 inclusive.

Following release, snakes that had experienced a period of enrichment during captivity to better simulate natural environments did not differ from conspecifics reared in more simplistic conditions on any measure of post-release behavior or performance. Moreover, captive snakes in both treatments exhibited habitat use, movement, thermoregulatory, and seasonal activity behaviors largely indistinguishable from resident conspecifics at the release site, and ultimately performed similarly in maintenance of body condition and survivorship. These results are in contrast to earlier releases and suggest that using older and larger individuals that have undergone a period of simulated winter dormancy may improve success during the early phase of establishment. However, captive snakes grew only one third as fast as wild native snakes, suggesting they experienced difficulties foraging in the wild.

We determined the influence of fire on wildlife, by quantifying reptile assemblage composition in response to fire in a weedy environment characterised by very short-term fire return intervals (<2 years). We used reptiles because they are often understudied, and are only moderately vagile compared to other vertebrates, and they respond strongly to changes in vegetation structure. We repeatedly sampled 24 replicate sampling sites after they had been unburned for two years, just prior to burning (pre-burnt), just after burning (post-burnt), and up to 15 months after burning (revegetated) and monitored vegetation structure and reptile richness, abundance and assemblage composition. Our sites were not spatially auto-correlated, and were covered by native kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra), black spear grass (Heteropogon contortus), or an invasive weed (grader grass, Themeda quadrivalvis). Reptile abundance and richness were highest when sites had been unburned for 2 years, and greatly reduced in all areas post burning. The lowest reptile abundances occurred in sites dominated by the weed. Reptile abundance and richness had recovered in all grass types 15 months after burning, but assemblage composition changed. Some species were present only in before our focus fire in native grass, and their populations did not recover even 15 months post-burning. Even in fire-prone, often-burnt habitats such as our study sites, in which faunal richness and abundance were not strongly influenced by fire, reptile assemblage composition was altered. To maintain faunal biodiversity in fire-prone systems, we suggest reducing the frequency of prescribed fires, and (if possible) excluding fire from weedy invasions if it allows native grasses to return.","10.1016/j.gecco.2016.02.002","CE","CE_9984",293,0.218617665426127,-0.0723279348621704,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
9985,2017,"Conservation and population recovery of gharials (<i>Gavialis gangeticus</i>) in Nepal","Herpetologica","The remnant populations of Gharials, Gavialis gangeticus, are now confined to the large, deep rivers of northern India and Nepal. In lowland Nepal, the populations are restricted to a few stretches of the Narayani-Rapti and Karnali-Babai river systems. Periodic censuses of the wild populations have been made over the past 12 yr. Here, we present population trends of Gharials in the Narayani, Rapti, and Babai rivers based on these surveys. The results indicate that the combined numbers of adults and subadults have been gradually increasing since 2005, but the numbers of adults are low and female biased, with very few males recorded from all study sites. In 1978, Nepal established a captive breeding center in Chitwan National Park, from which captive-bred animals have been periodically released 4-7 yr after hatching, at which time the animals are about 1.5 m total length. The detection of hatchlings and subadult classes that are smaller than these released animals in the rivers indicates that there is natural recruitment. Therefore, collecting all nests for ex-situ breeding might not be the best strategy until more rigorous field assessments are completed to determine the relative contributions of captive-bred versus natural recruitment. We suggest that more effort should be channeled toward field assessments, including mapping and monitoring habitat availability, habitat management to ensure necessary environmental flows to create sand banks and deep pools, and research to better understand the ecology and behavior of Gharials in Nepal's rivers.","10.1655/herpetologica-d-16-00048.1","CE","CE_9985",239,0.394051610328632,0.0788210571129247,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

However, these activities change local climate, and this, in turn, alter the composition of natural communities. The effect of these changes may be greater in those taxonomic groups with high sensitivity to habitat disturbance, such as amphibians and reptiles, which are the unique terrestrial ectothermic vertebrates. The present study aims to know the differences in diversity of amphibians and reptiles in a temperate forest under two silvicultural treatments, one of low and the other of high intensity, as well as from one, five and ten years of regeneration since the last logging event, Sierra Sur of Oaxaca, Mexico. Records of 21 species of herpetofauna (six amphibians and 15 reptiles) were obtained. The total species richness was similar in both treatments; however, the composition varied between sites with different recovery times. Higher abundance of amphibian was presented on sites with the low-intensity treatment, while reptiles were more abundant at sites with intensive treatment. Compared to a mature forest without management, sites with intensive treatment have more rare species, although the values of true diversity of amphibians were similar between treatments with different intensities, while for reptiles sites under treatment showed less diversity that unmanaged site: 33 % for intensive treatment and 28 % at sites with low intensity with respect to one control site. Complementary Analysis showed a difference of 86 % between the compositions of species in sites with intensive treatment. The treatment intensity was associated with an increase in the number of species, but the way they respond to changes in habitat depends largely on the population characteristics of each species and its ability to adapt to new conditions.","10.15517/rbt.v64i3.21525","CE","CE_9987",296,0.317758697103325,0.210022926542384,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
9988,2018,"Dispersal and population state of an endangered island lizard following a conservation translocation","Ecological Applications","Population size is widely used as a unit of ecological analysis, yet to estimate population size requires accounting for observed and latent heterogeneity influencing dispersion of individuals across landscapes. In newly established populations, such as when animals are translocated for conservation, dispersal and availability of resources influence patterns of abundance. We developed a process to estimate population size using N-mixture models and spatial models for newly established and dispersing populations. We used our approach to estimate the population size of critically endangered St. Croix ground lizards (Ameiva polops) five years after translocation of 57 individuals to Buck Island, an offshore island of St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands. Estimates of population size incorporated abiotic variables, dispersal limits, and operative environmental temperature available to the lizards to account for low species detection. Operative environmental temperature and distance from the translocation site were always important in fitting the N-mixture model indicating effects of dispersal and species biology on estimates of population size. We found that the population is increasing its range across the island by 5-10% every six months. We spatially interpolated site-specific abundance from the N-mixture model to the entire island, and we estimated 1,473 (95% CI, 940-1,802) St. Croix ground lizards on Buck Island in 2013 corresponding to survey results. This represents a 26-fold increase since the translocation. We predicted the future dispersal of the lizards to all habitats on Buck Island, with the potential for the population to increase by another five times in the future. Incorporating biologically relevant covariates as explicit parameters in population models can improve predictions of population size and the future spread of species introduced to new localities.","10.1002/eap.1650","CE","CE_9988",271,0.16765638639427,0.186017012736415,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
9989,2015,"Movement of translocated turtles according to translocation method and habitat structure","Restoration Ecology","Dispersal away from the release site is among the main obstacles that reduce translocation success. Scientists should therefore test a variety of translocation methods to reduce dispersal when moving wildlife between sites. The objective of this research was to examine how translocation method (hard- vs. soft-release) and habitat structure (continuous vs. patchy) affect movement of translocated turtles. A hard-release consists of releasing individuals to their new environment without any prior acclimation, whereas a soft-release forces animals to spend time at the release site prior to release. Our results suggest that the most effective translocation technique depends upon habitat structure. A soft-release was effective in minimizing post-release dispersal of translocated turtles in a continuous lotic habitat as there was no difference in the movement of soft-released and resident turtles. However, hard-released turtles undergo extensive movement when translocated to a continuous lotic habitat as hard-released turtles had greater movement than resident turtles. When the release site consists of a patchy wetland complex, a hard-release translocation may be effective as there was no difference in the movement between resident and hard-released turtles. Our study suggests that both the habitat structure of the release site and translocation method play a role in the movement patterns of translocated wildlife. Semi-aquatic turtles or species with poor vagility may make better candidates for hard-release translocations in patchy habitats because these species may be less likely or unable to disperse long distances as result of their behavior, physiology, or the structure of the release site.","10.1111/rec.12233","CE","CE_9989",259,0.214419852168054,0.241772461162567,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

In the Mediterranean Basin, planting pines has been a widespread practice that has transformed and degraded natural habitats. Understanding the response of living organisms to these anthropogenic disturbances and their management is essential for the conservation of biodiversity. Reforestation in Spain until the end of the 20th century was conducted primarily with Pinus species at unnaturally high densities. We have analyzed the response of a reptile community to thinning management in pine plantations within the Sierra Nevada National Park (SE Spain). Surveyed plots covered a gradient of tree densities (according treatments) from unlogged plots, 50% logged trees, 66% logged trees, and surrounding areas of open landscape with sparse trees. Four replicates (plots) were considered per treatment, with 4 visits per plot. In each plot, we measured three reptile community metrics, species richness, abundance, and Pielou's evenness. We hypothesize that reptile metrics will increase with the reduction of pine density and canopy, and an increase of solar radiation. Our results showed a negligible response after a 50% thinning, but a significant response of the reptile community after a 66% reduction. This study demonstrates that intense logging in pine plantations restores reptile diversity in the Mediterranean Basin. This is intended to serve as a model for forest management to restore biodiversity in this region.","10.1016/J.FORECO.2015.06.020","CE","CE_9993",217,0.298793080031142,0.108601050869359,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Approximately 77% of the Green Turtles were caught in nearshore fish corrals, mostly between October and May; whereas, 75% of the Olive Ridley Turtles were caught in offshore gill nets and long lines between April and October. Seventy-nine captured turtles were released, 73 of them with inconel flipper tags. Several turtles died from entanglement, serious injuries, slaughter for market, or diseases. An Olive Ridley Turtle and three Green Turtles were seen nesting at three beaches in southern and western Panay. Nesting of Hawksbill Turtles has been recorded at secluded beaches in Lawi, Guimaras about every three years; several batches of hatchlings have been raised by local residents before being released.

9995,2015,"Sea turtle rehabilitation success increases with body size and differs among species","Endangered Species Research","Wildlife rehabilitation can contribute to species conservation by releasing healthy individuals back into the wild and educating the public about threatening processes. Rehabilitation has substantial financial costs, however, and thus it is important to understand the success rates of these potential conservation management actions. We quantified the success rates for 1700 sea turtles admitted to rehabilitation facilities in Florida (USA) between 1986 and 2004. Rehabilitation success was low: 61.5% of turtles died in rehabilitation and only 36.8% were released back into the wild. A further 1.6% of turtles were maintained in captivity permanently due to the severe nature of their injuries. Most mortality occurred early during the rehabilitation process (within a few weeks), and successful rehabilitation often took several months to more than 3 yr. Loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta were most likely to survive rehabilitation, followed by Kemp's ridleys Lepidochelys kempii and green turtles Chelonia mydas; for all 3 species, larger individuals had an increased chance of successful rehabilitation. At face value, the low rates of rehabilitated turtles successfully released back into the wild may contribute only modestly to conservation in terms of contributing to population viability. However, many rehabilitation facilities provide important educational experiences that increase public awareness of the threats facing animals and highlight potential conservation solutions. Media coverage highlighting the release of rehabilitated animals further extends the conservation value of these efforts. Wildlife rehabilitation provides important direct benefits that, combined with social benefits, together may justify the expense and difficulty of rehabilitating individual animals.","10.3354/esr00696","CE","CE_9995",239,0.408356296846378,0.529307917323955,"250","positive","positive_250",0

Past studies have identified multiple factors that contribute to habitat suitability, including resource availability, presence of invasive species, landscape connectivity and climate. However, visual camouflage  coloration that conceals individuals from predators or prey  is another important ecological requirement that has been largely overlooked. We provide a case study to illustrate how color patterns of a prey species can change from that of the source site following translocation. Shore skinks (Oligosoma smithi) were moved from a coastal sand dune ecosystem to an offshore island beach that differed in substrate and color. Within one year following release, the translocated population's color pattern variation had reduced to mostly one pattern type. The high match in color patterns between the skinks and release site (including a new substrate type) may have contributed to the observed color pattern shift. This reduced variation in color pattern implies that not all founders survived, potentially decreasing the genetic diversity in the population. Our study highlights the importance of considering a species camouflage requirements when selecting habitat for release, not only to maximize founder survival and establishment success, but also to maintain phenotypic and genotypic diversity in the long-term.","10.1016/j.biocon.2016.10.002","CE","CE_9996",205,0.158267931840572,0.1327666954531,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Throughout the study area and regardless of management area, tortoise abundance was positively associated with one of the more diverse associations of perennial vegetation. The management area with the longest history of protection, a fence, and legal exclusion of livestock and vehicles had significantly more live tortoises and lower death rates than the other two areas. Tortoise presence and abundance in this protected area had no significant positive or negative associations with predators or human-related impacts. In contrast, the management area with a more recent exclusion of livestock, limited vehicular traffic, and with a recent, partial fence had lower tortoise densities and high death rates. Tortoise abundance here was negatively associated with vehicle tracks and positively associated with mammalian predators and debris from firearms. The management area with the least protection-unfenced, with uncontrolled vehicle use, sheep grazing, and high trash counts-also had low tortoise densities and high death rates.

10000,2018,"The importance of including survival release costs when assessing viability in reptile translocations","Biological Conservation","Translocations to restore populations of endangered species are an important conservation tool, but a reliable diagnosis is needed to assess their success. We used capture-recapture modeling to analyze the adult apparent survival of released and resident tortoises in two translocation projects in Spain monitored for 14 and 29 years. We tested if long-term survival rates differ between released and resident individuals, if survival was lower during the phase of establishment (i.e. release cost), how long acclimation lasts and if increased density due to releases affects survival. We found lower survival of released tortoises during the phase of establishment (1 to 3 years) when residents were already present. After establishment, survival was very high and unaffected by density-dependence. Body condition before release was similar between recaptured and dead/missing tortoises, and did not predict establishment survival. Stochastic population viability analysis showed that success when releasing small numbers of individuals strongly depends upon adult long-term survival. Release of small second batches of tortoises was not sensitive to a growing population, regardless of its release timing. Our results highlight long-term survival as crucial in translocation projects of long-lived species, invalidating short-term (first year) survival assessment, when survival release cost does not match long-term survival. A release cost of different duration should be included in model estimation before modeling predictions. Releasing tortoises (for welfare of captive individuals or for mitigating human negative impacts) in an already established population is not recommended under most circumstances. Acclimation cost is followed by survival approaching wild counterparts. If this milestone is not achieved, the project needs to be carefully assessed to adopt other management options or should be stopped altogether.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.11.023","CE","CE_10000",277,0.382942382557247,0.208242251543341,"300","neutral","neutral_300",1

Understanding how these forces interact is critical for designing better conservation measures for endangered species. This study draws on Indigenous ecological knowledge and practice to explore heterogeneity in faunal responses to Indigenously managed landscapes in the Western Desert of Australia. Using track plot surveys and satellite image analysis of fire histories, we find evidence that pyrodiversity increases activity measures of dingoes and monitor lizards. Dingoes were more active in recently burnt patches, while foxes were more active in slightly older burnt patches. These results add to previous work showing significant effects of pyrodiversity on kangaroo populations in the region. Together, the findings suggest that Aboriginal burning not only creates diverse niches for native animals, it helps to facilitate the ecological role of species that are themselves functionally vital. This work adds to a growing body of research suggesting that the loss of Aboriginal burning can cascade through ecosystems by transforming and simplifying ecological networks, thus contributing to the decline and extinction of vulnerable species.","10.1016/j.biocon.2018.01.008","CE","CE_10001",177,0.271209059655005,-0.015013177008866,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Continued rapid growth of suburban areas has accelerated this shift in habitat quality. Management strategies that promote shrub habitat within developed areas are rarely greeted with public acceptance because bushy thickets (e.g. Rubus brambles) shelter undesired species of animals (e.g. snakes, small mammals) and are typically associated with a lack of property maintenance. We conducted an experiment in a heavily impacted suburban habitat (population density of ~2700humans/km2). Our study site, containing forest and meadow habitats, was adjacent to a large city (~320,000 inhabitants) and visited by >70,000 people annually. We manipulated the forest habitat by removing trees, and through active maintenance, thereby promoting the growth of brambles. Within six years, we observed that newly-created shrub habitat was rapidly colonized by snakes, notably Vipera aspis. The total number of detected individuals increased markedly over time.

10004,2017,"Can protective attributes of artificial refuges offset predation risk in lizards?","Austral Ecology","Artificial refuges are often used to supplement habitat in areas where natural shelters have been degraded or removed. Although artificial refuges are intended to support particular species, they may be equally attractive and accessible to others, including predators. We explored the influence of snake predation risk and shelter attributes on the overnight use of different artificial refuges (timber, tiles, and iron) using the predator-prey relationship between Boulenger's skink, Morethia boulengeri and the curl snake, Suta suta. We collected adult M. boulengeri from two bioregions in south-eastern Australia: the Riverina, where the two species co-occur, and the South Western Slopes, where S. suta does not occur. Two adult S. suta were collected for use as chemical donors. We conducted four experiments on overnight refuge choice to determine: (i) predator-scent avoidance, (ii) artificial refuge preferences, (iii) a trade-off between a preferred refuge and predator-avoidance, and (iv) the effect of gap height on refuge preference. We found that skinks avoided predator-scented refuges in favour of identical, but unscented refuges. Skinks preferred timber refuges, and most skinks maintained this preference when predator-scent was added. However, when gap height was manipulated, skinks shifted to the refuge with the smallest gap. Skinks displayed complex regional variation in behaviour; skinks from both bioregions avoided predator-scent, but in the trade-off experiment, skinks from the South Western Slopes were less likely to avoid predator-scented timber refuges than those from the Riverina. Our findings suggest that protective refuge attributes, such as small gap height, can offset the risk implied by predator-scent within a refuge. This study highlights the need to consider predator-prey interactions when designing and using artificial refuges for habitat restoration or biological monitoring.","10.1111/aec.12469","CE","CE_10004",288,0.254734499841755,0.163705573679511,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Some introduced grasses can be managed using fire and grazing, but experiments, replicated in time and space, are required to determine the relative costs and benefits of this action on native biodiversity. We aimed to experimentally determine the effect on reptile and amphibian assemblages of repeated burning and grazing of the invasive weed para grass (. Urochloa mutica) over three years in a north Queensland conservation reserve in Australia. We measured the diversity and abundance of reptiles and amphibians, and quantified temperature and humidity during an experiment that repeatedly grazed, burnt, or burnt and grazed para grass in a replicated series of experimental plots. All burnt plots were drier and sites that were both burnt and grazed were hotter. The frog and reptile community was dominated by a few common species. Richness changed seasonally and was strongly related to the distance from the nearest woodland and free water, but it was unaffected by the management treatments. Abundance of the skink (. Lampropholis delicata) and frog (. Limnodynastes convexiusculus) decreased with burning and grazing, while a closely related frog (. Limnodynastes tasmaniensis) remained unaffected. There was a clear trade-off between decreasing the abundance of a few common species to increase the overall suitability of habitat for a diversity of native species. We suggest that, in this case, it is reasonable to make the value judgement that this trade-off is acceptable.","10.1016/j.biocon.2014.09.003","CE","CE_10005",249,0.329107139751669,0.212795221660855,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

We monitored 215 tortoises over 3 years to evaluate translocation effects on temperature, condition, growth, and mortality of tortoises adjacent to the world's largest solar thermal plant located in southern California. On the basis of generalized estimating equation mixed models, maximum daily tortoise temperature increased with environmental temperature then leveled off at highest environmental temperatures for all three groups (translocated, resident, and control) likely due to behavioral thermoregulation. This pattern was consistent among groups, but translocated tortoises had higher average maximum daily temperature and durations above 35 °C than resident and control tortoises in the first month post-translocation, with smaller effects in the second and fourth months, and no differences in subsequent years. During the first year, adult translocated males had higher temperatures than females. Average percent changes in body condition and carapace length increased post-translocation for all groups and there were no differences in mortality probability among groups or years. Based on the relatively short-term thermal effects, and lack of negative effects on condition, growth, or mortality, our study suggests relatively minimal impacts following short-distance translocation releases in spring.

We examined changes in Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) population size and changes in the size-class distribution within the population using aerial and ground survey data from 1971-2009 in the Ndumo Game Reserve (NGR), South Africa. In addition, crocodiles were caught opportunistically for aging, sexing, and tagging. Precision and accuracy of population estimates were affected by water level, season, and the use of different observers. Future surveys should occur in austral winter and at low water levels. The NGR population increased from an absolute abundance of 348 (±3.4; an estimate of precision based on 1 SE) in the early 1970s to maximum absolute abundance of 992 (±58.7) in 1994 as a result of a restocking program initiated in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The population structure is currently skewed towards subadults and adults and the current population is in decline. This is a result of low recruitment levels in NGR, which are unable to sustain the artificially high population size created by the restocking program. Also contributing to this decline is the poaching of crocodiles and destruction of suitable and historical nest sites. Sex ratios were skewed toward females in juveniles and subadults and toward males in adults, while the overall sex ratio in the population was even. The current NGR Nile Crocodile population is estimated at an absolute abundance of 846 (±263). We predict that the NGR Nile Crocodile population will continue to decline in the future as part of the natural process, but the decline will be accelerated on account of poaching, uncontrolled harvesting, and destruction of nesting habitat.","10.1655/herpetologica-d-13-00090","CE","CE_10009",275,0.334620732123807,-0.051834296995442,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10010,2016,"Challenges of monitoring reintroduction outcomes: insights from the conservation breeding program of an endangered turtle in Italy","Biological Conservation","Captive breeding and reintroduction programs remain a powerful but divisive tool for management of threatened species, with a proven potential to avoid extinction, but low long-term success rates and high resource requirements. Monitoring the results of reintroductions is critical to be able to assess short- and long-term success, adjusting management decisions as new information becomes available. In this study, we assessed the first 15 years of the captive breeding and restocking program for the European pond turtle Emys orbicularis in Liguria, northern Italy. We estimated survival of released turtles by modelling mark-recapture monitoring data. We then used those estimates to update our prior expectations about long-term outcomes, and to adjust management decisions about the age of individuals to release. Modelling results suggest released turtles had sufficiently high survival, matching prior expectations, such that local extinction has been averted in the short-term. Survival was similar among candidate age classes for releases, suggesting the release of younger individuals can provide positive outcomes while reducing management costs. On the other hand, survival varied among sites, indicating the need for ongoing in-situ habitat management to ensure long-term persistence. Moreover, the late onset of sexual maturity in the species means reproduction of released animals cannot yet be determined with certainty. Captive breeding and reintroduction programs normally require long-term efforts; therefore, focused monitoring that is clearly linked to decision-making is necessary to continually refine and adjust management strategies.","10.1016/j.biocon.2016.05.003","CE","CE_10010",240,0.287613357973788,0.287259821979602,"250","neutral","neutral_250",1

Currently, the terrapin is listed as a species of special concern in several states where one of the prominent threats to populations is the drowning of terrapins in commercial crab pots. Bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) that narrow the funnel opening on crab pots exclude terrapins, but BRDs face opposition from the fishing industry due to fears that they will decrease target species catch. The primary goals of this research were to examine the efficacy of two sizes of BRDs in excluding terrapins from crab pots and to assess the impact of BRDs on blue crab catch. Crab pots were deployed in paired and triplicate designs at estuarine sites along the central and southern coast of North Carolina in the summers of 2012 and 2013. A total of 4039 legal sized blue crabs and 14 terrapins were captured over the course of the study. Bycatch reduction devices did not have a statistically significant effect on catch rates or carapace width of legal-sized blue crabs. Thirteen of the 14 captured terrapins were in control pots, and one male terrapin was captured in a pot equipped with a large size BRD. An integrated approach that combines data on the spatial ecology and demography of terrapins with information on the most appropriate BRD dimensions for terrapin exclusion is most likely to succeed in addressing the issue of terrapin bycatch.","10.1016/j.fishres.2016.08.010","CE","CE_10011",244,0.316506816092827,-0.0354197581760815,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
10012,2011,"Movement patterns by <i>Egernia napoleonis</i> following reintroduction into restored jarrah forest","Wildlife Research","Context The value of animal reintroduction as a conservation tool is debated. This is largely because the limited quantity of research that has been conducted on animal reintroductions has shown varying degrees of success in establishing new populations. The reasons why some reintroductions are successful, whereas others are not, are often not clear. Aims The present research aims to determine whether reptile reintroduction into restored mine pits is a potential management technique for managing and conserving reptile populations within a mined landscape. Methods Twelve Napoleon's skinks were trapped then fitted with 0.9-g transmitters. Half were reintroduced into 5-year-old restored mine pits and the other half into unmined forest. Bodyweights, movement patterns and macro-habitat selection were recorded weekly during November and then monthly until March. Key results Skinks reintroduced into restored sites quickly moved into unmined forest. Both groups of skinks moved large distances, but those reintroduced into restored sites travelled further than did control skinks and took longer to reduce their distances travelled, showing possible stress as a result of release into unsuitable habitat. Eventually, almost all skinks found suitable habitat in unmined forest and settled into these areas while continuing to gain weight. Conclusions Reintroduction was an ineffective technique for facilitating colonisation of restored minesites by Napoleon's skink. Lack of suitable micro-habitats within restoration areas, such as ground logs and coarse, woody debris piles, is likely limiting the use of these areas by Napoleon's skinks and is likely to be the cause of their failure to remain or settle in restored sites after reintroduction. Implications Determining the habitat requirements of skinks and replicating this in restoration sites would seem the more appropriate management option than is reintroduction, and this may be the case for other reptiles and habitat specialists. © 2011 CSIRO.","10.1071/WR11063","CE","CE_10012",294,0.263731139131196,0.147223498426465,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10013,2015,"Effects of hook and bait in a tropical northeast Atlantic pelagic longline fishery: Part I-Incidental sea turtle bycatch","Fisheries Research","The interaction between tuna fisheries and sea turtles is commonly recognized as one of the major threats and causes for the decline of sea turtle populations. Within the tuna and swordfish fisheries, the incidental sea turtle bycatch is usually more frequent from longline fisheries targeting swordfish. Therefore it is important to test possible mitigation measures, particularly in areas where fishing activities and high abundance of these species overlaps, as is the case of the Tropical Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Between August 2008 and December 2011, a total of 202 experimental pelagic longline sets were carried out in that region (latitude: 11-22°N, longitude: 20-38°W). The aim was to test the effects of changing the traditional J-style hooks (10° offset) baited with squid used by the fishing industry, against two circle hooks (one non-offset and one with 10° offset) and mackerel bait. Four sea turtle species were captured, with the leatherback Dermochelys coriacea comprising most of the bycatches (BPUE, bycatch per unit of effort using the traditional configuration of 0.990 turtles/1000 hooks), followed by three hardshell species: the loggerhead Caretta caretta and the olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea (BPUE. =. 0.165 turtles/1000 hooks), and the Kemp ridley Lepidochelys kempii (BPUE. =. 0.024 turtles/1000 hooks). In general, the sea turtle interactions in the fishery can be reduced by changing from the traditional gear to one of the experimental combinations. However, those reductions were species-specific, with the leatherback bycatches reduced only when changing from J-style to the non-offset circle hook, while for the hardshell turtles both the hook style (using a circle hook, with or without offset) and the bait (using mackerel) significantly reduced the incidental bycatches. Hooking location was also species-specific, with most hardshell specimens hooked by the mouth and esophagus, while leatherbacks were mostly hooked externally by the flippers. Most of the sea turtles were captured and released alive with the mortality rates independent of the hook style and bait type used. A reduction of 55% in leatherback incidental bycatches can be expected in this fishery by changing from J-style to circle hooks, whereas for the hardshell species a 50-59% reduction can be obtained by changing to circle hooks (respectively with and without offset), and a 55% reduction by using mackerel bait.","10.1016/j.fishres.2014.11.008","CE","CE_10013",362,0.177216710246858,-0.00652643641640398,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
10015,2017,"Mitigation reduces road mortality of a threatened rattlesnake","Wildlife Research","Context Reducing road mortality is essential to reptile conservation in regions with dense road networks. The Georgian Bay, Ontario population of the eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus) is designated as Threatened, in part because of high road mortality. In Killbear Provincial Park, four ecopassages and barrier fencing were constructed along three busy park roads to reduce road mortality of massasaugas. Aim Although mitigation of road mortality has been widely recommended and in some instances implemented for reptiles, effectiveness of mitigation efforts is often inadequately evaluated. The goals of our study were to use long-term data to quantify the effectiveness of ecopassages and barrier fencing in reducing massasauga fatalities on roads, and to evaluate the potential of these structures to serve as movement corridors for individual snakes. Methods We used five approaches to assess the overall efficacy of mitigation efforts: (1) comparison of pre- and post-mitigation road mortality; (2) camera traps in ecopassages to document massasauga and predator presence; (3) automated tag readers in ecopassage entrances to detect PIT-tagged individuals; (4) an experiment to assess massasauga willingness to enter and travel through ecopassages; and (5) measurement of temperature fluctuations in ecopassages to assess thermal suitability for massasaugas. Key results We found a significant decrease in road mortality of massasaugas on stretches of park roads associated with ecopassages and barrier fencing post construction. Automated tag readers and cameras detected the presence of massasaugas and other animals within the ecopassages, and experimental data showed that massasaugas willingly entered, and in some cases crossed through, ecopassages. Conclusion Our evaluation of mitigation structures determined that they successfully reduce road mortality and provide potential movement corridors between bisected habitats, provided that intense maintenance of the fencing is conducted yearly. We also demonstrated the need to utilise a combination of multiple post-monitoring methods to effectively evaluate mitigation structures. Implications This study provides a template for construction of similar mitigation in other key locations where reptile road mortality occurs.","10.1071/WR16130","CE","CE_10015",320,0.193501341089559,-0.0151584755809356,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Natural disturbance cycles of erosion and accretion maintain nesting habitat on these beaches by controlling dune vegetation and sand quality. The nesting beach at Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, is designated 'critical habitat' for leatherback turtles by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. It harbors the largest nesting population (>800 females) in the USA. It is an important rookery for Atlantic leatherback recovery efforts. For the past 30 yr, the beach has been continuously monitored and managed in order to increase hatchling recruitment and conservation. Our study highlights how a multiyear change in the natural disturbance cycle has affected dune plant growth and leatherback production at this beach. Reduced summer erosion relaxed natural control of Ipomoea pes-caprae, a native dune plant, allowing its seaward spread to cover >75% of the nesting beach. This spread of vegetation led to both direct and indirect interactions between nesting leatherbacks and I. pes-caprae. Because the beach is managed in order to protect leatherback nests, a dune vegetation control plan was needed. We measured the effects of 3 vegetation management options on nest success: herbicide treatment, aboveground mechanical removal, and undisturbed vegetation. These treatments were compared to nest success at a non-vegetated control site. We found that the spread of I. pes-caprae reduced nesting habitat and nest productivity. Aboveground vegetation treatment did not control root growth into nests. We discuss possible vegetation management strategies to improve leatherback nesting habitat quality and maximize nest productivity while minimizing anthropogenic disturbance to the natural beach dynamics. © Inter-Research 2011.","10.3354/esr00361","CE","CE_10016",272,0.242569630630694,0.176425387271584,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

This situation applies within large tracts of land owned by Indigenous people across northern Australia. The commercial use of saltwater crocodiles Crocodylus porosus is a growing industry in Australia's Northern Territory. Although Indigenous people sell crocodile eggs and hatchlings, the majority of harvesting and incubation is done by non-indigenous people from less remote areas. One Indigenous community has been heavily involved in this industry and now manages its own harvest and incubation programme. We present a case study of this programme, which has transitioned from outside agencies managing the harvest, to complete local ownership and management. Egg harvests and incubation success rates declined by 40% following the switch to local management. Income increased, as did production costs; in particular, royalty payments made to Indigenous landowners. The declines reflect the community's motives for engaging in the industry, which have been socially rather than commercially driven, and damage to nesting habitat by feral animals. The increase in royalties reflects the need to compete with non-indigenous harvesters from outside the township, who are strictly commercially driven. Harvesting, incubation and trade in crocodile eggs and hatchlings can form a viable and sustainable enterprise for remote Indigenous communities. However, efficiency needs to be improved to fulfil the need for a reliable and dependable supply chain, and regulatory institutions should give Indigenous harvesters sufficient freedom to pursue innovative and viable livelihood options.","10.1017/S0030605317000217","CE","CE_10017",248,0.254958116314409,0.244987572466548,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

In a seawater tank, far fewer crabs entered crab pots fitted with red plastic by-catch reduction devices (BRDs), relative to pots without BRDs. Crab retention times, however, were significantly longer in pots fitted with red BRDs. In a second experiment, fewer terrapins entered crab pots with funnels painted red relative to black. From a field pilot study, the legal crab catch from pots with red BRDs was similar to pots without BRDs, and terrapin by-catch was reduced. Relative to those treatments, fewer crabs and more terrapins were captured in pots with orange BRDs and blue BRDs, and in pots with a magnetic field directed into the funnel openings. Based on these results, a final field trial yielded comparable crab catch from 15 pots without BRDs and 15 pots fitted with red plastic BRDs. Of a by-catch of 68 terrapins, 58 were from pots without BRDs.

We investigated filters through a long-term study examining reptile and mammal recolonization of, and population persistence in, post-mining restoration in the northern jarrah forest of southwestern Australia. Neither mammal community composition, nor individual mammal species, differed between unmined forest and restoration but reptile communities did and some reptile species were significantly less abundant in restoration than in unmined forest. We concluded that there were no filters to mammal recolonization and persistence but that there were both unidirectional (decreasing gradually over time) and dynamic (fluctuating over time) filters to reptile recolonization of post-mining restoration that influenced both recolonization and population persistence of some reptile species. Low volumes of coarse woody debris appeared to be a unidirectional filter that will slow recolonization by some reptile species for decades or even centuries. Canopy cover appeared to be a dynamic filter that fluctuated over a period of >7 years and precluded population persistence of some reptile species that had already recolonized the post-mining restoration. A dearth of studies made it difficult to generalize how widespread these filters were in restoration areas but studies of thinning and burning in natural forests suggested they were likely to be widespread. Although management techniques to reduce the effect of unidirectional and dynamic filters remain poorly developed, their development and adoption will improve the ability of restoration to facilitate fauna recolonization and persistence and better contribute towards biodiversity conservation.","10.1111/aec.12647","CE","CE_10019",260,0.386143613536174,0.169537266092356,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Integrated modeling approaches can improve estimation of demographic rates necessary for making predictions, even for rare or cryptic species with sparse data, but their use in management applications is limited. We developed integrated models for a population of diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) impacted by road-associated threats to (i) jointly estimate demographic rates from two mark-recapture datasets, while directly estimating road mortality and the impact of management actions deployed during the study; and (ii) project the population using population viability analysis under simulated management strategies to inform decision-making. Without management, population extirpation was nearly certain due to demographic impacts of road mortality, predators, and vegetation. Installation of novel flashing signage increased survival of terrapins that crossed roads by 30%. Signage, along with small roadside barriers installed during the study, increased population persistence probability, but the population was still predicted to decline. Management strategies that included actions targeting multiple threats and demographic rates resulted in the highest persistence probability, and roadside barriers, which increased adult survival, were predicted to increase persistence more than other actions. Our results support earlier findings showing mitigation of multiple threats is likely required to increase the viability of declining populations. Our approach illustrates how integrated models may be adapted to use limited data efficiently, represent system complexity, evaluate impacts of threats and management actions, and provide decision-relevant information for conservation of at-risk populations.","10.1016/j.biocon.2018.03.023","CE","CE_10021",254,0.260005550625359,0.140974707172627,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Previous studies have reared hatchlings in outdoor, predator-proof pens for 59 y before release, in efforts to produce hatchlings in excess of 100110 mm midline carapace length that are believed to be predation-resistant. We began a comparative study to evaluate indoor-rearing to shorten this rearing period by facilitating faster initial growth.

The Cerrado biodiversity hotspot suffers higher deforestation rates than Amazonia and concentrates most of the burned areas in South America. To support adequate fire-management decisions in Cerrado, knowledge on the effects of altered fire regimes upon its animal populations is necessary. Based on a long-term, large-scale fire experiment, we investigated the effects of different fire regimes on the demography of the gymnophthalmid Micrablepharus atticolus, an endemic lizard of the Cerrado. Because M. atticolus is more abundant in open habitats, we predicted that frequent burns should favor its populations. Over eight years, we conducted a mark-recapture study using pitfall trap arrays in five 10 ha plots of cerrado sensu stricto, subjected to prescribed burns. Using generalized linear mixed-models of time series data and an information theoretic approach to select demographic models, we describe the life history of M. atticolus and assess the response of apparent survival, detectability, and recruitment to burn regimes and climate variation. Micrablepharus atticolus has an annual life cycle, with complete annual population turnover; breeding takes place during the dry season, when activity is higher, and hatchlings appear in the wet season. Apparent survival, detectability, and recruitment increased in the short-run after the passage of fire in all experimental plots. In the long run, however, both fire-suppression and more severe fire regimes were seemingly detrimental, presumably by affecting microclimatic conditions and food availability. Short-term studies may not adequately describe the effects of fire on the demography of lizard populations. Adequate fire management is warranted for biodiversity conservation in Cerrado, both inside and outside protected areas, including a reduction in the frequency and severity of burns in open physiognomies and controlled, patch mosaic fires to prevent excessive fuel accumulation in denser physiognomies.","10.2994/sajh-d-15-00011.1","CE","CE_10027",305,0.312433479385412,-0.0848515746863679,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
10028,2017,"Translocating ratsnakes: does enrichment offset negative effects of time in captivity?","Wildlife Research","Context Wildlife translocation is a conservation tool with mixed success. Evidence suggests that longer time in captivity may negatively affect an animal's post-release behaviour and survival. However, environmental enrichment may reduce the deleterious effects of captivity for animals that are going to be released into the wild. Aims The aim of the present study was to compare first-year post-release survival and behaviour of translocated ratsnakes (Pantherophis obsoletus) held captive for varying durations (1-7 years) either with or without enrichment, with that of resident and wild-to-wild (W-W)-translocated ratsnakes. Key results Being in captivity before release negatively affected survival; 11 of 19 (57.9%) captive snakes died or were removed from the study within 12 months, compared with 3 of 11 (27.3%) resident snakes and none of five (0%) W-W snakes. Furthermore, survival probability declined the longer a snake had been in captivity. Six of the seven snakes (86%) that we released that had been in captivity for four or more years before release died during this study, regardless of whether they were enriched or not. Although W-W-translocated ratsnakes moved more often and further than did snakes in other groups, this difference was apparent only in the first month post-release. We found no evidence that abnormal movement patterns or winter behaviour was the cause of reduced survival for captive snakes. Instead, our data suggested that spending time in captivity reduced concealment behaviour of snakes, which likely increased the vulnerability of snakes to predators. Captivity also compromised the foraging ability of some of the snakes. Although there were no overall differences in percentage weight change among the four groups, two snakes (one enriched, one unenriched) were removed from the study because of extreme weight loss (>30%). Conclusions Our results suggested that environmental enrichment did not offset the negative effects of captivity on ratsnakes and that the likely mechanism responsible for low survival was vulnerability to predators. Implications Whether extended periods in captivity render other species unsuitable for translocation, how long it takes for captivity to have deleterious effects, and whether environmental enrichment is also ineffective at offsetting captivity effects in other species remain to be determined.","10.1071/WR17016","CE","CE_10028",352,0.246585205274037,-0.0976409705769957,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

There is abundant evidence that wildlife makes use of such structures as safe passages to cross roads. We analyzed the spatial relationship between road drainage elements (N = 253; mostly culverts) as potential faunal underpasses, and mortality due to vehicle collisions in two seasons and on four relatively low-traffic roads (<5000 cars/day) traversing oak rangelands of western Andalusia (S Spain). Focusing on amphibians, reptiles and mammals, we recorded and located casualties (N = 238 individuals, 35 species) along these roads, identifying and characterizing all potential underpasses. Overall frequencies of casualties and spatial distribution were highly variable both within and among these roads. We obtained an estimation of potential permeability for the different roads. We detected, located and described a wide supply and a very variable pattern of drainage culverts and other underpasses, with differences among roads in passage attributes potentially affecting permeability for wildlife, such as spatial arrangement, number, density (frequency or concentration of passages) and dimensions. We used Mantel tests to assess spatial congruence of passages and road-killed animals. We applied generalized linear mixed models fitted by maximum likelihood through Akaike Information Criterion to explain the variation in the distance of the 238 casualties to the nearest underpasses, with road transect and season as random factors, and traffic intensity, speed and vertebrate class as fixed effects. Both road-killed animals and underpass distribution followed aggregated patterns, and casualties were not significantly related to underpasses along any of the 4 roads. There were no differences in distance of casualties to the nearest underpass for the three vertebrate classes. Although existing underpasses were abundant, we could not correlate potential permeability with reduced mortality along these roads, and other factors potentially affecting roadkill aggregations should be evaluated along with permeability assessment. Mitigation of road-caused mortality can still be greatly improved for these roads, through measures of reconditioning and proper management of existing underpasses, aiming to maximize road permeability and reducing major impacts upon animal populations of Andalusian rangelands.","10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.05.043","CE","CE_10029",350,0.157945463892328,0.0848364602961903,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

We examined whether prescribed fire can be used to aid in conservation of the endangered eastern massasauga rattlesnake Sistrurus catenatus catenatus Raf. by maintaining open-canopy early successional summer habitats that this species requires for thermoregulation (basking). Using a formal experimental design, we characterized vegetation, surface temperature, moisture, and snake occurrence in control and burned treatments before and after prescribed fire. Prescribed fire increased vegetative cover and thereby decreased ground temperature compared to pre-treatment and control conditions, whereas rattlesnake occurrence increased dramatically after the prescribed fire. A habitat suitability model indicated that snake presence was negatively affected by forb cover, which became more dominant relative to other vegetation in the absence of fire. Prescribed fire also increased the cover of legumes and maintained graminoid cover and high overall plant functional diversity-all of which decreased in the absence of fire. In conclusion, prescribed fire stimulated overall vegetation growth while promoting varied microhabitats that included greater proportions of graminoids and sufficient number of patches of bare ground, both locally associated with warmer temperatures and presence of this endangered species of rattlesnake. © Inter-Research 2013.","10.3354/esr00529","CE","CE_10031",198,0.259883283619942,0.0302504086089455,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

This exploratory study compared turtle assemblages in six reference and six restored streams in the North Carolina Piedmont, which were assessed using standard trapping practices with baited hoop nets. We also quantified turtle-relevant habitat characteristics (structure, water quality, vegetation) through reach-scale surveys to assess potential differences in turtle composition. Turtle abundance at restored sites was more than twice that of references sites and trends existed in the distribution of turtle species, but neither abundance nor composition was found to be statistically different. Habitat characteristics that affect turtle communities were not equivalent between sites, with reference streams having higher canopy cover, and lower total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and total suspended solids than restored streams. Mantels test and non-metric multidimensional scaling plots indicated that turtle composition was significantly correlated with habitat and vegetation, and that turtle communities were generally separated between restored and reference streams. These findings suggest a pattern that restored streams with riparian wetlands may provide more suitable habitat than reference streams for most southeastern Piedmont turtle species, but further studies are required to fully examine these patterns.","10.1007/s13157-014-0603-5","CE","CE_10032",204,0.445286073907373,0.44636877122272,"250","positive","positive_250",0
10034,2011,"Freshwater turtle conservation in Texas: harvest effects and efficacy of the current management regime","Journal of Wildlife Management","The collapse of Asian turtle populations led to the creation of a worldwide freshwater turtle market in the 1990s. Texas is one of several states in the United States that has capitalized on this market. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) recently instituted regulations designed to protect turtles from commercial harvest in public waters. Two counties in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) accounted for 66.1% of known wild turtle harvest in 1999, with no reported harvest in subsequent years. We sampled 60 sites in the LRGV to determine if we could detect harvest effects. We also investigated the potential for sustainable harvest under the new harvest guidelines using source-sink dynamics implemented in a Geographic Information System (GIS) approach. We detected differences congruent with harvest effects for red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Texas spiny softshells (Apalone spinifera). Based on a GIS analysis of water bodies throughout the entire state, we estimated that only 2.2% of water bodies are protected under the current commercial harvest regulations. We determined source water bodies could supply 30.5% of sink water bodies in the LRGV, and we concluded that long-term sustainable turtle harvest is unlikely under the current management regime due to the intensity of commercial harvests, the low number of protected water bodies, and non-robust or non-interactive protected populations. One solution to this would be modification of the regulations to include season and bag limits, a management strategy currently implemented in various forms by 14 states in the eastern half of the United States. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.73","CE","CE_10034",253,0.233713242134345,0.18396193242019,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Translocated reptiles do not always become established at the release site. We simulated a translocation site for an Endangered Australian skink, the pygmy bluetongue lizard Tiliqua adelaidensis, to investigate whether adding food would encourage released individuals to disperse less. We provided artificial burrows in a central release area within circular cages and found that lizards were more likely to remain in a burrow, spent less time exposed on the ground surface and were less likely to move out of the central area when food was provided. These modified behaviours are likely to encourage translocation success if lizards with added food expose themselves less frequently to predators, and if fewer of those lizards disperse away from the translocation site in the early days after release. We suggest that the provision of supplementary food will be an important component of any trans -location programme for this lizard. © Inter-Research 2012.","10.3354/esr00446","CE","CE_10035",182,0.261818016875326,0.182768973828594,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Translocated animals might disperse from prime habitat and face unsuitable habitat and possible increased exposure to predators. This might lead to decline of a translocated population and could compromise the success of translocation. We assessed whether short-term confinement within enclosures at the translocation site can significantly decrease post release movement, if confinement allowed animals to become familiar with the new habitat, and to overcome handling related stress. We simulated the translocation of an Australian lizard, the endangered pygmy bluetongue lizard Tiliqua adelaidensis, into the centre of a large enclosure and compared the behaviour between individuals confined to the central region for one or five days before release. We found that lizards confined for five days spent less time basking, and were more likely to disperse than lizards confined for just one day. We suggest that short-term confinement of lizards induces additional stress and that extra days of short-term confinement will not necessarily improve the success of a translocation. Future research could determine the effectiveness of different durations of confinement for releasing animals at translocation sites. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2013.","10.1163/15685381-00002863","CE","CE_10036",203,0.211331576427581,0.00741160319695454,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

This fleet interacts with loggerhead turtles. During twenty trips in which 48,020 hooks were deployed, a total of 16 loggerheads were captured, most of them were juveniles, and direct mortality was estimated to be 43.75%. During the fishing operation, the hauling of the gear started one to three hours after and sometimes occurred immediately after setting. Results obtained show that the soak time did not affect the capture of turtles and target species, whereas it influenced the mortality rate of turtles. Bottom longline should be studied more in depth throughout the Mediterranean Sea, as well as parameters related to the interaction with sea turtles. However, mitigation measures to reduce turtle by-catch are urgently needed. In this way, we propose: (i) reducing the fishing soak time; (ii) experimenting with gear modification such as the use of circle hooks; and (iii) conducting an awareness campaign aimed at fishermen to show them how to deal with turtle by-catch.

Indeed, beneficial effects of grazing are expected by maintaining open meadows, but overgrazing is supposed to increase mortality by trampling. Grazing has been shown to negatively impact the survival of European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in the Camargue. Consequently, a new management plan was defined. We investigated the consequences of this management using capture-recapture methods to estimate variations of population sizes in this managed site and a control site over a 17 years period. Results show an increase of the number of adults and juveniles on the managed site after the management change. Our results suggest that improved water management with flooding in autumn provided better hibernation conditions, and that reduced grazing intensity in autumn/winter likely decreased the risk of trampling. Population size significantly increased in less than 4 years following the management change, probably by the relaxation of density-dependence.

We report on a successful translocation of the critically endangered St. Croix ground lizard, Ameiva polops, extirpated from St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, Caribbean, by predation from introduced mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus). We translocated 57 adult A. polops from Green Cay to Buck Island in May 2008. We placed 4 females and 3 males each in eight, 100 m2, enclosures on Buck Island for 71 days, then the enclosures were opened. During the enclosure period, 20 individuals were identified and 32 others were seen. The average number sighted per survey was only 5.28 (range = 2-10). One hatchling was sighted in an enclosure, indicating a translocated female successfully nested. Body condition of the translocated individuals increased significantly by the end of the enclosure period. Population monitoring surveys at 61 sites across Buck Island showed that 5 years after the initial translocation in June 2013, the new population had grown to an estimated 1,473 individuals and occupied 58.9% of the island. We attribute eradication of mongoose, life history of the species, large propagule size, condition of habitat, soft-release, use of adults, interagency collaboration, and systematic assessment as primary factors that facilitated this successful translocation.

10045,2017,"Increased pollinator habitat enhances cacao fruit set and predator conservation","Ecological Applications","The unique benefits of wild pollinators to the productivity of agricultural crops have become increasingly recognized in recent decades. However, declines in populations of wild pollinator species, largely driven by the conversion of natural habitat to agricultural land and broad-spectrum pesticide use often lead reductions in the provision of pollination services and crop production. With growing evidence that targeted pollinator conservation improves crop yield and/or quality, particularly for pollination specialist crops, efforts are increasing to substitute agriculturally intensive practices with those that alleviate some of the negative impacts of agriculture on pollinators and the pollination services they provide, in part through the provision of suitable pollinator habitat. Further, similarities between the responses of some pollinators and predators to habitat management suggest that efforts to conserve pollinators may also encourage predator densities. We evaluated the effects of one habitat management practice, the addition of cacao fruit husks to a monoculture cacao farm, on the provision of pollination services and the densities of two groups of entomophagous predators. We also evaluated the impacts of cacao fruit husk addition on pollen limitation, by crossing this habitat manipulation with pollen supplementation treatments. The addition of cacao fruit husks increased the number of fruits per tree and along with hand pollination treatments, increased final yields indicating a promotion of the pollination ecosystem service provided by the specialist pollinators, midges. We also found that cacao fruit husk addition increased the densities of two predator groups, spiders and skinks. Further, the conservation of these predators did not inhibit pollination through pollinator capture or deterrence. The findings show that, with moderate habitat management, both pollinator and predator conservation can be compatible goals within a highly specialized plant-pollinator system. The effectiveness of this habitat manipulation may be attributable to the increased availability of alternative habitat and food resources for both pollinators and predators. The results exemplify a win-win relationship between agricultural production and biological conservation, whereby agricultural practices to support vital pollinators and pollination services can increase production as well as support species conservation.","10.1002/eap.1491","CE","CE_10045",339,0.306505810172934,0.422129219932935,"350","positive","positive_350",1

Large natural and anthropogenic debris were removed from one of three sections of a sea turtle nesting beach and distributions of nests and false crawls (non-nesting crawls) in pre- (2011-2012) and post- (2013-2014) removal years in the three sections were compared. The number of nests increased 200% and the number of false crawls increased 55% in the experimental section, whereas a corresponding increase in number of nests and false crawls was not observed in the other two sections where debris removal was not conducted. The proportion of nest and false crawl abundance in all three beach sections was significantly different between pre- and post-removal years. The nesting success, the percent of successful nests in total nesting attempts (number of nests + false crawls), also increased from 24% to 38%; however the magnitude of the increase was comparably small because both the number of nests and false crawls increased, and thus the proportion of the nesting success in the experimental beach in pre- and post-removal years was not significantly different. The substantial increase in sea turtle nesting activities after the removal of large debris indicates that large debris may have an adverse impact on sea turtle nesting behavior. Removal of large debris could be an effective restoration strategy to improve sea turtle nesting.","10.1016/j.jembe.2016.04.005","CE","CE_10047",238,0.206064737369848,0.0976028818969684,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) has become Australia's most endangered snake due to a dependence on rock habitats that are subject to high rates of human-induced degradation. The permanence of degradation can only be reversed by outcrop restoration. We constructed experimental outcrops near ( 500 m) from roads and walking trails (access points). We tested two hypotheses over a 14-year period: that outcrop restoration can restore habitat quality, and that the frequency of outcrop degradation is influenced by distance from access points. We confirmed that habitat value was restored: lizard prey of the broad-headed snake was more abundant in constructed compared to natural outcrops; broad-headed snakes were detected equally in constructed and natural outcrops. Disturbance to constructed outcrops occurred more often and was more severe at near compared to far outcrops. The probability of occupancy by broad-headed snakes was 0.75 ± 0.13 in 29 far outcrops compared to 0.41 ± 0.11 in 35 near outcrops, suggesting a response to disturbance and more frequent poaching at near outcrops. Habitat restoration for the broad-headed snake should have its greatest value at locations far from access points. Restricting access should be a principal strategy to manage rock outcrop ecosystems. Outcrop disturbance is not unique to Australia. These findings have relevance to management of rock outcrops worldwide. Habitat restoration is an expensive conservation tool for endangered species, particularly if unsuccessful. Small-scale restoration experiments that aim to refine procedures should precede large-scale restoration.","10.1111/rec.12421","CE","CE_10051",245,0.331177001985835,-0.0643381821132636,"250","neutral","neutral_250",1
10053,2016,"Reptile and amphibian response to oak regeneration treatments in productive southern Appalachian hardwood forest","Forest Ecology and Management","Forest restoration efforts commonly employ silvicultural methods that alter light and competition to influence species composition. Changes to forest structure and microclimate may adversely affect some taxa (e.g., terrestrial salamanders), but positively affect others (e.g., early successional birds). Salamanders are cited as indicators of ecosystem health because of their sensitivity to forest floor microclimate. We used drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps in a replicated Before-After-Control-Impact design to experimentally assess herpetofaunal community response to initial application of three silvicultural methods proposed to promote oak regeneration: prescribed burning; midstory herbicide; and shelterwood harvests (initial treatment of the shelterwood-burn method) and controls, before and for five years post-treatment. Species richness of all herpetofauna, amphibians, reptiles, frogs, salamanders, or snakes was unaffected by any treatment, but lizard species richness increased in the shelterwood harvest. Capture rate of total salamanders decreased post-harvest in shelterwood units after a 23 year delay; Plethodon teyahalee decreased post-harvest in shelterwoods, but also in control units. In contrast, capture rate of total lizards and Plestiodon fasciatus increased in shelterwood stands within the first year post-harvest. Prescribed burn and midstory herbicide treatments did not affect any reptile or amphibian species. A marginally lower proportion of juvenile to adult P. teyahalee, and a higher proportion of juvenile P. fasciatus in shelterwood than control units suggested that heavy canopy removal and associated change in microclimate may differentially affect reproductive success among species. Our study illustrates the importance of longer-term studies to detect potential changes in herpetofaunal communities that may not be immediately apparent after disturbances, and highlights the importance of including multiple taxa for a balanced perspective when weighing impacts of forest management activities.","10.1016/j.foreco.2016.06.023","CE","CE_10053",283,0.334450493848533,0.142536068616542,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Many species of reptiles and amphibians are ground-dwelling, potentially increasing their vulnerability to prescribed fire, especially during the growing-season when they are most active. We used drift fences with pitfall traps to experimentally assess how herpetofaunal species and communities responded to early, growing-season burns, dormant-season burns, and unburned controls. We documented no adverse effects of either growing-season burns or dormant-season burns on any common herpetofaunal taxa, but capture rates of total, adult, and juvenile five-lined skinks (Plestiodon fasciatus) were greater following growing-season burns. Most measurements reflected little or transient change in forest structure. However, canopy cover decreased by an average of 16% in growing-season burns within four growing-seasons of burning, with some tree mortality in patches where fire temperature likely was hotter. Our study suggests that even modest reductions in canopy cover may positively affect relative abundance and reproductive success of P. fasciatus. We cautiously suggest that a higher mean ground-level fire temperature and the physiologically active condition of vegetation in growing-season burns interacted to damage a greater proportion of trees, resulting in more canopy thinning than in dormant-season burns. However, weather, fuel types and condition, vegetation structure, and topography interact to affect fire intensity and the level of mortality or damage to canopy trees within and among stands, regardless of season conducted. We suggest that herpetofaunal response, for the species we studied, is more closely linked to change in canopy cover than to season of burn per se.","10.1016/j.foreco.2017.12.016","CE","CE_10054",266,0.322937286749226,0.0415426907578537,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Whether the removal of livestock facilitates passive recovery of these assemblages depends on habitat condition and the species present. We explore changes in small mammal and reptile species richness, abundance, and composition in a degraded chenopod shrubland dominated by Acacia victoriae ssp. and open Acacia aneura (mulga) woodland destocked in 1976 and 1984, respectively. Data were obtained between 1997 and 2007, from two grazed and two ungrazed sites in each community. Species richness increased at a faster rate in ungrazed open A. aneura woodland, but did not differ significantly between ungrazed and grazed degraded chenopod shrubland. Subsequent analyses at a finer-scale detected disparate responses in richness and abundance for microhabitat. At this scale, a greater number of species-specific responses were also detected, including increased abundance of generalist species and decreased abundance of species requiring low cover. These results reiterate the potential for species-specific responses to livestock that are more apparent in particular microhabitats. Furthermore, this investigation provides evidence for the gradual passive recovery of small mammal and reptile assemblages in both communities, which is facilitated by the removal of livestock in open A. aneura woodland in fair condition, but not degraded chenopod shrubland in poor condition.","10.1111/rec.12542","CE","CE_10056",212,0.226446488355199,0.27336547959377,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Key stakeholders were interviewed to investigate the perceived impact of the main interventions employed in Cape Verde to reduce illegal harvesting, trade and consumption of marine turtles. Despite an apparent decrease in harvesting and consumption, our results suggest there has been a shift from subsistence harvesting to trade in Boa Vista. The existence of laws to protect marine turtles was perceived as a deterrent to harvesting, and awareness campaigns and a lack of availability were perceived as reasons for the decrease in consumption in Boa Vista and Santiago, respectively. Aiming to inform ongoing discussions, we recommend a multi-targeted approach focusing on both suppliers and consumers to magnify conservation effectiveness.

These measures have been associated with reduced hatching rates, altered hatchling sex ratio, fetal dysmorphic anatomical features, and feeble hatchlings health. Previous studies have shown that MMN and natural nests (NN) provide different incubatory conditions. Therefore, incubatory challenges imposed by MMN conditions on fetal development could induce stress responses affecting hatchlings functional morphology later on life. There is no evidence of incubatory stress associated with conservation measures in turtle fetuses or hatchlings. Thus, in this paper we tested the hypothesis that MMN incubation exposes turtle fetuses to stressing conditions. Given that the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis begins functioning by day 11 of incubation in reptiles, our experiments explored the effects of incubatory conditions, rather than those associated with translocation, on fetal stress responses. We showed that Lepidochelys olivacea hatchlings incubated in MMN displayed reduced body weight, hypertrophic inter-renal glands, testicular hypotrophy and hypotrophic dorso-medial cortical pyramidal neurons, when compared with hatchlings emerging from NN. Furthermore, MMN hatchlings had higher serum levels of corticosterone at emergence, and displayed an attenuated acute stress response after traversing the beach. Therefore, the relocation of nests to protect them could negatively impact the health and survival of sea turtles. Thus, this action should only be undertaken when no alternative is available.","10.3389/fmars.2017.00400","CE","CE_10066",225,0.284363172000933,0.00553682020469233,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
10069,2016,"Effects of a landscape disturbance on the habitat use and behavior of the black racer","Copeia","The effects of disturbance, including prescribed fire, vary among species and their ability to adjust to the altered environment. Our objective was to link fire-caused habitat changes with shifts in habitat use and behavioral changes in the Southern Black Racer (Coluber constrictor priapus). We compared habitat availability between burned (experimental) and unburned (control) plots and used radio telemetry to evaluate snake behavior and habitat use. The numerical abundance of C. constrictor in burned habitat was nearly twice that in the control. In both treatments, C. constrictor was associated with areas that were more open, had less canopy cover, more new vegetative growth, and less, shallower leaf litter. However, the availability of these habitats was greater in the burn treatment. Snakes were more surface active in the burn treatment and tended to be more arboreal in the control treatment. Differences in available habitat may have caused an increase in surface activity in the burn treatment, which could have biased detection rates and created higher apparent abundance in the burned treatment. Females moved more often in the control treatment, which may be due to a lack of preferred thermal habitat and reproductive thermoregulatory demands. Ultimately, fire changed habitat availability and altered the movement rates and behavior of C. constrictor causing ecological effects that may not be detected when researchers only compare abundance.","10.1643/CE-15-373","CE","CE_10069",221,0.150077508160777,0.0437904544793582,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
10070,2018,"Response of reptile and amphibian communities to the reintroduction of fire in an oak/hickory forest","Forest Ecology and Management","Fire can have diverse effects on ecosystems, including direct effects through injury and mortality and indirect effects through changes to available resources within the environment. Changes in vegetation structure such as a decrease in canopy cover or an increase in herbaceous cover from prescribed fire can increase availability of preferred microhabitats for some species while simultaneously reducing preferred conditions for others. We examined the responses of herpetofaunal communities to prescribed fires in an oak/hickory forest in western Kentucky. Prescribed fires were applied twice to a 1000-ha area one and four years prior to sampling, causing changes in vegetation structure. Herpetofaunal communities were sampled using drift fences, and vegetation attributes were sampled via transects in four burned and four unburned plots. Differences in reptile community structure correlated with variation in vegetation structure largely created by fires. Amphibian community structure differed on a yearly basis, indicating that sampled communities were likely influenced by environmental factors other than the burning. We found taxa-specific differences in abundances for Coluber constrictor, Diadophis punctatus, Sceloporus undulatus, Lithobates clamitans and snakes as a group, being more abundant in burned areas while Anaxyrus sp., Notophthalmus viridescens and Plethodon glutinosus were more abundant in unburned areas. Differences in amphibian taxa abundances may have been influenced by availability of aquatic breeding habitat and yearly weather variation. Our results suggest that the vegetation structure changes caused by prescribed fire can have indirect impacts on reptile abundances and community structure, while not significantly impacting amphibian communities.","10.1016/j.foreco.2018.06.018","CE","CE_10070",246,0.132905402443481,0.099889721454263,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

However, these management tools have demonstrated capabilities of improving conservation value in these forests in the southeastern United States. Therefore, we investigated summer herpetofaunal responses to factorial combinations of dormant-season prescribed fire and a commonly used herbicide (imazapyr) with a randomized complete block design of 6 mid-rotation pine stands with 4 experimental units in Mississippi, USA, to which we applied at random 1 of 4 treatments (i.e., burn only, herbicide only, burn+herbicide, control). We captured 814 reptiles and 3,699 amphibians of 17 and 16 species, respectively, using drift-fence arrays during May and June, 1999-2007. Herpetofaunal assemblages only differed between burn+herbicide and control plots in 2002. Species-specific responses were limited to differences across years within treatments and greater eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) relative abundance in burned or herbicide-treated sites soon after treatment. Furthermore, herpetofaunal associations with measured environmental variables (e.g., vegetation structure and biomass and trap-site characteristics) did not indicate that treatment influenced fluctuations in species relative abundances. Consistent with past studies, forest managers of commercial pine forests using dormant-season prescribed fire with or without imazapyr will most likely have minimal additional effects on herpetofaunal assemblages, but current knowledge gaps require additional research to better understand mechanisms of species abundance and persistence in these landscapes. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/wsb.372","CE","CE_10072",254,0.479682344645569,0.244191894893939,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Experimental approaches are needed to compare the outcomes of translocation strategies, including those involving head-starting (the rearing of juveniles in captivity before release). Here, we studied the reintroduction of head-started and wild-caught juveniles of a distinctive reptile, the tuatara Sphenodon punctatus, on the South Island of New Zealand. We compared morphometric, ecophysiological, behavioural and spatial aspects for juveniles from three groups (wild-caught from a warmer climate, head-started from a warmer climate and head-started from the local climate), focusing on the first 5months of summer following release. Group did not affect body condition at recapture, but wild-caught juveniles, despite being the only animals with ticks at release, grew faster and had higher inferred body temperatures than individuals head-started in a warmer climate. Wild-caught juveniles were less frequently seen emerged than juveniles head-started at the release site, and no animals had ticks at the summer's end. Mean dispersal distance and home-range size did not differ significantly between groups, and all groups had high survival (96.4-100% over first summer; at least 66.7-73.3% after the first winter following release). We conclude that, for most metrics, post-release performance of head-started and wild-caught juvenile tuatara was similar, and that head-started groups can differ between each other as much as between captive and wild.

We assessed how endangered eastern massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) responded to 2 types of manipulations at a wetland site in New York, USA: 1) cutting shrubs to create =100-m2 plots within known gestation areas in 2008, 2011, and 2012, and 2) cutting tree and shrub cover in the adjacent forest to create a 4-ha forest clearing in 2011. Based on systematic visual surveys from June to August in 2011 and 2012, we estimated snake presence among manipulated and unmanipulated plots in response to plot treatment date. We observed massasaugas selecting newly manipulated plots more often than unmanipulated plots within known gestation areas in both 2011 and 2012, but we detected no increase in massasauga activity within the adjacent forest clearing in either year. The effectiveness of vegetation cutting appeared to decline after 3 years because of vegetation re-growth.

However, the specific mechanisms influencing dispersal within such landscapes remain poorly understood. The objective of our study was to assess how matrix type (improved pasture, native pasture or crop) and structure (grass height) influence fine-scale reptile movement, as well as influences of crop sowing direction and setting-sun position. In an agricultural region of south-eastern Australia, we first released 20 individuals of an arboreal gecko (Christinus marmoratus) at set distances from trees to determine the distance at which they could perceive their tree habitat (perceptual range). We then translocated 36 individuals into six matrix environments within their perceptual range of isolated trees to examine how gecko movement was modified by the type and structure of the matrix. We also recorded crop sowing direction and setting-sun position and examined all recorded tracks using angular statistics. We found that geckos exhibited a perceptual range of 4080m. Short matrix environments promoted direct movements towards trees, irrespective of matrix type. Furthermore, movements were significantly affected by crop sowing direction with individuals following the planted lines. Our study has three significant implications: (i) restoring mature tree spacing to 80 m apart will assist gecko movements, (ii) targeted management for low pasture height, such as by maintaining directional narrow strips of low vegetation among taller pastures, might assist movement and facilitate increased connectivity, (iii) directional sowing of crops between habitat patches presents a simple but potentially effective tool for reconnecting fragmented landscapes.","10.1016/j.agee.2016.10.019","CE","CE_10079",254,0.286667378713278,0.180890636862258,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10080,2017,"Effects of past and present livestock grazing on herpetofauna in a landscape-scale experiment","Conservation Biology","Livestock grazing is the most widespread land use on Earth and can have negative effects on biodiversity. Yet, many of the mechanisms by which grazing leads to changes in biodiversity remain unresolved. One reason is that conventional grazing studies often target broad treatments rather than specific parameters of grazing (e.g., intensity, duration, and frequency) or fail to account for historical grazing effects. We conducted a landscape-scale replicated grazing experiment (15,000 km2, 97 sites) to examine the impact of past grazing management and current grazing regimes (intensity, duration, and frequency) on a community of ground-dwelling herpetofauna (39 species). We analyzed community variables (species richness and composition) for all species and built multiseason patch-occupancy models to predict local colonization and extinction for the 7 most abundant species. Past grazing practices did not influence community richness but did affect community composition and patch colonization and extinction for 4 of 7 species. Present grazing parameters did not influence community richness or composition, but 6 of the 7 target species were affected by at least one grazing parameter. Grazing frequency had the most consistent influence, positively affecting 3 of 7 species (increased colonization or decreased extinction). Past grazing practice affected community composition and population dynamics in some species in different ways, which suggests that conservation planners should examine the different grazing histories of an area. Species responded differently to specific current grazing practices; thus, incentive programs that apply a diversity of approaches rather than focusing on a change such as reduced grazing intensity should be considered. Based on our findings, we suggest that determining fine-scale grazing attributes is essential for advancing grazing as a conservation strategy.","10.1111/cobi.12779","CE","CE_10080",266,0.310574532899914,0.130285946840812,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

While land management agencies in the United States promote conservation buffer strips as beneficial to wildlife populations, we know little about snake use of these habitats, especially in relation to multiscale factors. Our poor understanding of these relationships hinders effective design and management of these habitats to conserve biodiversity. We evaluated the influence of buffer design, management, and surrounding landscape characteristics on snake occurrence in grassed waterways in southeastern Iowa. We documented snakes at nearly 80% of the grassed waterways and captured 119 individual snakes of five species; one of which, the Smooth Green Snake (Lioclonorophis vernalis), is listed as a species of conservation concern in Iowa. We used a multiple logistic regression and an information theoretic approach to determine the most parsimonious local and landscape variable models that best explained snake species occurrence. The ""local"" waterway design variable, width, occurred in the best local variable models for three of the five species and was positively associated with snake presence for all three species. Landscape variable models also helped explain snake presence; individual species responded differently to the various landscape metrics.

10084,2018,"An empirical test of the role of learning in translocation","Animal Conservation","Translocation centers on the introducing, reintroducing, or augmenting populations by moving individuals from existing wild source populations to different locations with purportedly suitable habitat. Despite much research in and application of translocation, this technique is often marred by low success rates. While many possible factors could contribute to low translocation success, outcomes are often improved when researchers engage in a soft release, which provides the animals with the opportunity for extra time to acclimate to their release site, indicating that aspects of learning may play an important role in translocation success. To test the importance of the time available for learning in translocation success, we performed hard and soft releases into an existing population of Eastern painted turtles Chrysemys picta that has experienced seasonal ephemeral water sources and in which resident turtles navigate to new permanent sources of water with extreme precision (±3.5 m) using specific routes known to be facilitated by learning. Translocated adult turtles in both hard- and soft-release groups failed to successfully negotiate upland habitat, even when given 3 months to prospect and learn (the maximum time possible in our system). Likewise, turtles in both groups moved more slowly, stopped more frequently, and were slower to restart movement than resident adults. Finally, both translocated groups exhibited significant drops in body mass and elevated rates of predation. In contrast, juveniles from the same donor population navigated to alternative water successfully, with movements and mortality rates not different from resident animals. These results indicate that complex aspects of cognition beyond time to learn can influence translocation success and highlight the importance of considering how and when animals learn.","10.1111/acv.12357","CE","CE_10084",268,0.432788041759259,0.391951228352499,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10085,2012,"Spatial and temporal effects of grazing management and rainfall on the vertebrate fauna of a tropical savanna","The Rangeland Journal","Grazing by domestic livestock is one of the most widespread uses of the rangelands of Australia. There is limited information on the effects of grazing by domestic livestock on the vertebrate fauna of Australia and the establishment of a long-term grazing experiment in north-eastern Queensland at Wambiana provided an opportunity to attempt an examination of the changes in vertebrate fauna as a consequence of the manipulation of stocking rates. The aim was to identify what the relative effects of vegetation type, stocking rate and other landscape-scale environmental factors were on the patterns recorded. Sixteen 1-ha sites were established within three replicated treatments (moderate, heavy and variable stocking rates). The sites were sampled in the wet and dry seasons in 19992000 (T0) and again in 200304 (T1). All paddocks of the treatments were burnt in 1999. Average annual rainfall declined markedly between the two sampling periods, which made interpretation of the data difficult. A total of 127 species of vertebrate fauna comprising five amphibian, 83 bird, 27 reptile and 12 mammal species were recorded. There was strong separation in faunal composition from T0 to T1 although changes in mean compositional dissimilarity between the grazing stocking rate treatments were less well defined. There was a relative change in abundance of 24 bird, four mammal and five reptile species from T0 to T1. The generalised linear modelling identified that, in the T1 data, there was significant variation in the abundance of 16 species explained by the grazing and vegetation factors. This study demonstrated that vertebrate fauna assemblage did change and that these changes were attributable to the interplay between the stocking rates, the vegetation types on the sites surveyed, the burning of the experimental paddocks and the decrease in rainfall over the course of the two surveys. It is recommended that the experiment is sampled again but that the focus should be on a rapid survey of abundant taxa (i.e. birds and reptiles) to allow an increase in the frequency of sampling and replication of the data. This would help to articulate more clearly the trajectory of vertebrate change due to the relative effects of stocking rates compared with wider landscape environmental changes. Given the increasing focus on pastoral development in northern Australia, any opportunity to incorporate the collection of data on biodiversity into grazing manipulation experiments should be taken for the assessment of the effects of land management on faunal species. © Australian Rangeland Society 2012.","10.1071/RJ11049","CE","CE_10085",397,0.22334513758188,0.0809845708529376,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Methods to mitigate turtle bycatch mortality typically involve reducing the capture of bycatch using gear modifications. Another method to reduce mortality is to keep bycatch alive following capture. Using physiological measures of anoxia, this study determined whether providing air spaces using floats within fyke nets could prevent turtles from drowning. In a controlled setting, blood lactate and pH of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) experimentally introduced into submerged nets, nets with floats, and nets that breached the surface were compared. While emulating commercial fishing practices - where turtles and fish voluntarily entered nets - catch rates and compositions as well as blood lactate in turtles captured were compared in submerged nets with and without floats. Painted turtles in submerged nets exhibited elevated blood lactate and pronounced acidosis compared with turtles from nets with floats and surfaced nets. Catch rates and compositions from emulated fishing were statistically similar in nets with and without floats; however, total fish catches were roughly one-third less in nets with floats. The same pattern of physiological disturbance was observed with turtles captured in submerged nets with and without floats as in the controlled experiment. Overall, blood physiology indicated that anoxia occurred in turtles in submerged nets while nets with floats reduced physiological disturbance. However, variation in blood lactate levels when fishing fyke nets with floats suggests that turtles were experiencing slight anoxia and so the size of air spaces may be important in allowing access to air. Creating air spaces in fyke nets using floats is a simple and cost-effective method to avoid the drowning of turtles. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","10.1002/aqc.1247","CE","CE_10086",281,0.140971641218999,-0.0315332138075421,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Few studies have assessed the impacts of fire and cattle grazing on herpetofauna assemblages in grasslands. A patch-burn grazing study at Osage Prairie, MO, USA in 20112012 created landscape patches with treatments of grazing, fire, and such legacies. Response variables were measured before and after the application of treatments, and I used robust-design occupancy modeling to estimate patch occupancy and detection rate within patches, and recolonization and extinction (i.e., dispersal) across patches. I conducted redundancy analysis and a permuted multivariate analysis of variance to determine if patch type and the associated environmental factors explained herpetofauna assemblage. Estimates for reptiles indicate that occupancy was seasonally constant in Control patches ( ~ 0.5), but declined to ~ 0.15 in patches following the applications of fire and grazing. Local extinctions for reptiles were higher in patches with fire or light grazing (e ~ 0.7) compared to the controls. For the riparian herpetofaunal community, patch type and grass height were important predictors of abundance; further, the turtles, lizards, snakes, and adult amphibians used different patch types. The aquatic amphibian community was predicted by watershed and in-stream characteristics, irrespective of fire or grazing. The varying responses from taxonomic groups demonstrate habitat partitioning across multiple patch types undergoing fire, cattle grazing, and legacy effects. Prairies will need an array of patch types to accommodate multiple herpetofauna species.","10.1007/s00267-014-0355-2","CE","CE_10088",238,0.213467337886303,0.0126876991412992,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Using path analysis, we identified some of the mechanisms giving rise to differences in patterns of species richness and individual species occurrence between grazed and ungrazed plantings. Specifically, we found evidence of both: (1) indirect effects of grazing on various elements of biodiversity mediated through changes in vegetation condition (primarily the leaf litter layer), and (2) direct effects of grazing on biodiversity (irrespective of modification in vegetation cover attributes), possibly as a result of trampling by livestock. We also uncovered evidence of direct effects on bird and reptile biota of other planting attributes such as planting width and planting age. The results of our study suggest that the biodiversity benefits of restoration programs can be undermined by grazing, especially by uncontrolled grazing.

Fish bycatch was similar between bait types, but tandem hoop nets baited with ZOTE© soap caught up to 61% fewer turtles and mortality of turtles that were captured was up to 12% lower than those baited with cheese. Depth of net set, water temperature, and Secchi depth were environmental factors measured that affected catch and bycatch, but varied among species.

On small oceanic islands that host very important endangered sea turtle rookeries, ghost crabs are the main nest predators. Mortality in nests was evaluated on the island of Boa Vista which hosts around 75% of the nests in the Cape Verde archipelago, which is one of the world's largest loggerhead turtle (. Caretta caretta) rookeries. In an extensive survey of the island, egg mortality significantly varied between beaches and averaged 70%. One of the main causes of egg mortality was predation by ghost crabs (. Ocypode cursor) that stole an average of 33 eggs per nest. No other egg predator was observed during the study. In an intensive field experiment, the egg mortality for non-protected nests was 82% and ghost crabs predated an average of 50% of the total number of eggs. Even though female tracks on the beach are very conspicuous immediately after egg laying, very few nests were predated during this period. In contrast, most of the nests were predated at the end of the incubation period (after day 40 of incubation), when female tracks are not visible on the beach. Nests predated by larger crabs suffered a lower predation rate, suggesting that these larger dominant crabs defend the nest they prey upon. On-beach nest relocation had no significant influence on reducing egg predation. Females preferred nesting on beaches with higher hatching success although predation was not a risk that they seemed able to assess.","10.1016/j.jembe.2015.03.010","CE","CE_10137",248,0.230096084840722,-0.0741227289363578,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

After mitigation, locations where we found reptiles on the road were associated with fence ends, underscoring the importance of fence integrity and ineffectiveness of partial fencing as a mitigation strategy. We confirmed use of culverts by Blanding's turtles, northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica), snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), and midland painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). Through radio-tracking, we determined that male and female Blanding's turtles home ranges overlapped with different segments of the causeway.

We used this unexpected herbicide application as an opportunity to provide a preliminary assessment of the short-term impacts on reptiles of glyphosate spot-spraying of Bitou Bush. Using an M-BARCI design, we compared reptile assemblages among uninvaded (reference) sites, invaded (control) sites and invaded and sprayed (impact) sites before and after spraying. We found no significant short-term (7 - 10 months) differences in reptile abundance, species richness or assemblage composition among invaded, uninvaded and sprayed sites before and after glyphosate application. We cautiously interpret our results to generate a preliminary finding that spot-spraying of Bitou Bush with glyphosate appears not to have a deleterious effect on reptile assemblages at seven and ten months following herbicide application. While we would not recommend basing management decisions on the outcomes of our study alone, we suggest that our findings can be used to assist in the development of strategic analyses of glyphosate impacts on native flora and fauna. © 2012 Ecological Society of Australia.","10.1111/emr.12019","CE","CE_10139",201,0.167849050154028,0.0150538311387893,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

We conducted a controlled, replicated experiment to optimise habitat restoration for the threatened Australian pink-tailed worm-lizard, Aprasia parapulchella while reducing fire fuel load in a rapidly developing urban area. We used dense addition of natural rock (30 % cover) and native grass revegetation (Themedatriandra and Poasieberiana) to restore critical habitat elements. Combinations of fire and herbicide (Glyphosate) were used to reduce fuel load and invasive exotic species. Rock restoration combined with herbicide application met the widest range of restoration goals: it reduced fire fuel load, increased ant occurrence (the primary prey of A. parapulchella) in the short-term and increased the growth and survival of native grasses. Lizards colonised the restored habitat within a year of treatment.

To minimize the risk of terrapins entering crab pots, researchers have suggested the use of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) to reduce the size of crab pot openings and thereby exclude terrapins from entering crab pots. Despite these recommendations, few studies have observed terrapin interactions with BRDs and effectively evaluated the efficacy of these devices at preventing the entry of terrapins into pots. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of BRD presence and orientation on terrapin behaviour around crab pots and overall terrapin capture rates. In a controlled laboratory setting, terrapins investigated crab pots more frequently when crab pots were baited with fish versus chicken. Terrapins were captured more frequently when BRDs were not installed. The presence of the BRDs also increased the length of time necessary for a terrapin to enter a crab pot and decreased the proportion of entries relative to the number of investigations. Vertically-oriented BRDs were more effective than horizontally-oriented BRDs at reducing terrapin captures. To prevent the continued decline of terrapin populations due to crab fisheries, it is recommended that crabbers avoid the use of fish as bait in crab pots to reduce the attractiveness of pots to terrapins and fit all crab pots with vertically-oriented BRDs to reduce terrapin entrapment.

Our objective was to relate variation in herpetofauna abundance to changes in habitat caused by a beetle used for Tamarix biocontrol (Diorhabda carinulata; Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and riparian restoration. During 2013 and 2014, we measured vegetation and monitored herpetofauna via trapping and visual encounter surveys (VES) at locations affected by biocontrol along the Virgin River in the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. Twenty-one sites were divided into four riparian stand types based on density and percent cover of dominant trees (Tamarix, Prosopis, Populus, and Salix) and presence or absence of restoration. Restoration activities consisted of mechanically removing non-native trees, transplanting native trees, and restoring hydrologic flows. Restored sites had three times more total lizard and eight times more yellow-backed spiny lizard (Sceloporus uniformis) captures than other stand types. Woodhouse's toad (Anaxyrus woodhousii) captures were greatest in unrestored and restored Tam-Pop/Sal sites. Results from VES indicated that herpetofauna abundance was greatest in the restored Tam-Pop/Sal site compared with the adjacent unrestored Tam-Pop/Sal site. Tam sites were characterized by having high Tamarix cover, percent canopy cover, and shade. Restored Tam-Pop/Sal sites were most similar in habitat to Tam-Pop/Sal sites. Two species of herpetofauna (spiny lizard and toad) were found to prefer habitat components characteristic of restored Tam-Pop/Sal sites. Restored sites likely supported higher abundances of these species because restoration activities reduced canopy cover, increased native tree density, and restored surface water.","10.1111/rec.12273","CE","CE_10151",261,0.173772813881794,0.224113087945873,"300","neutral","neutral_300",1
10152,2017,"No paternal genetic integration in desert tortoises (<i>Gopherus agassizii</i>) following translocation into an existing population","Biological Conservation","Translocations are a tool widely used by wildlife managers, yet their impact is often insufficiently evaluated. Most translocation studies only assess the initial establishment phase, and the majority of long-term persistence studies to date have only tracked female fecundity. Male genetic integration for mitigative translocations have as of yet not been assessed and could greatly undermine the validity of translocation evaluations. To test for successful male integration, we determined genetic paternity of 92 desert tortoise hatchlings (Gopherus agassizii), from both resident and translocated females, four years after the initial translocation event and found that all 35 hatchlings with a paternal match in our genotype database were sired by residents. Given that translocated males constitute 46% of the genotyped males found in the home ranges of the females, they produce significantly fewer offspring than resident males in the same area (G-test, p value < 0.0001). This is the first study assessing paternal genetic integration following a translocation of a wild sourced population into a native resident population. We hypothesize that male condition following the translocation, female mate preference for prior residents and competitive exclusion by resident males may contribute to the lower reproductive output of translocated males. We advocate the use of genetic paternity testing in other species to determine the generality of male translocation success across taxa given this unexpected and alarming result.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.04.030","CE","CE_10152",220,0.184958131887892,0.0760307812963458,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Turtle interactions with gear can be defined as those that are "" observable"" based on standard fishery observer protocols, plus unobserved interactions, which include both quantifiable and unquantifiable interactions. Once a gear modification is in place, a turtle interaction that was once observable may become unobservable, because the gear modification successfully prevented the turtle from being captured. This paper describes turtle interactions in scallop dredge gear from 2001 to 2008, identifies gear and environmental correlates with observable interaction rates, and reports the average annual number of interactions and adult-equivalent interactions before and after chain mats were mandated in the fishery. Fisheries observer data were used to develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to estimate rates of observable interactions of hard-shelled turtles. These rates were applied to commercial dredge fishing effort to estimate the total number of observable interactions, and to infer the number of unobservable, yet quantifiable interactions after chain mats were implemented. Interaction rates of hard-shelled turtles were correlated with sea surface temperature, depth, and use of a chain mat. The average number of annual observable interactions of hard-shelled turtles in the Mid-Atlantic scallop dredge fishery prior to the implementation of chain mats (1 January 2001 through 25 September 2006) was estimated to be 288 turtles (CV = 0.14, 95% CI: 209-363), which is equivalent to 49 adults. After implementation of chain mats, the average annual number of observable interactions was estimated to be 20 turtles (CV = 0.48, 95% CI: 3-42), equivalent to 4 adults. If the rate of observable interactions from dredges without chain mats had been applied to trips with chain mats, the estimated number of observable and inferred interactions of hard-shelled species after chain mats were implemented would have been 125 turtles per year (CV = 0.15, 95% CI: 88-163). Results from this analysis suggest that chain mats and fishing effort reductions contributed to the decline in estimated turtle interactions after 2006. © 2010.","10.1016/j.fishres.2010.10.017","CE","CE_10154",333,0.118149502835423,0.0103645495557513,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
10155,2017,"Habitat drives dispersal and survival of translocated juvenile desert tortoises","Journal of Applied Ecology","In spite of growing reliance on translocations in wildlife conservation, translocation efficacy remains inconsistent. One factor that can contribute to failed translocations is releasing animals into poor-quality or otherwise inadequate habitat. Here, we used a targeted approach to test the relationship of habitat features to post-translocation dispersal and survival of juvenile Mojave desert tortoises Gopherus agassizii. We selected three habitat characteristics  rodent burrows, substrate texture (prevalence and size of rocks) and washes (ephemeral river beds)  that are tied to desert tortoise ecology. At the point of release, we documented rodent burrow abundance, substrate texture and wash presence and analysed their relationship to the maximum dispersal. We also documented the relative use by each individual for each habitat characteristic and analysed their relationships with survival and fatal encounters with a predator in the first year after release. In general, the presence of refugia or other areas that enabled animals to avoid detection, such as burrows and substrate, decreased the overall mortality as well as predator-mediated mortality. The presence of washes and substrate that enhanced the tortoises ability to avoid detection also associated with the reduced dispersal away from the release site. These results indicate an important role for all three measured habitat characteristics in driving dispersal, survival or fatal encounters with a predator in the first year after translocation. Synthesis and applications. Resource managers using translocations as a conservation tool should prioritize acquiring data linking habitat to fitness. In particular, for species that depend on avoiding detection, refuges such as burrows and habitat that improved concealment had notable ability to improve the survival and dispersal. Our study on juvenile Mojave desert tortoises showed that refuge availability or the distributions of habitat appropriate for concealment are important considerations for identifying translocation sites for species highly dependent on crypsis, camouflage or other forms of habitat matching.","10.1111/1365-2664.12774","CE","CE_10155",306,0.330563956157539,0.304603193848065,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

The first day of nesting varied by 29 d among years and was correlated with the number of heating degree days in May (i.e., colder springs were associated with later start dates). Substantial variation in body size was found among reproductive females, with a range of carapace lengths (CL) of 79 mm and a 3.8-fold difference in body mass. Larger females showed a weak but significant tendency to nest earlier than smaller females each year. Females captured on coal tailings had significantly higher body temperatures than females in the mitigated area. We estimated minimum female age at maturity at 9 y and the median age at 14 y from counts of scute annuli. Population age structure was probably much broader (and older) than that indicated by our age estimates, however, because more than a quarter of all adult females appeared to be too old to accurately age. Clutch size averaged 10.3 eggs and increased with female body size. Larger and heavier females also produced larger and heavier hatchlings. We estimate that 12-21% of females produced two clutches annually, and 0.5% of females produced three clutches.

We determined sex ratios in juvenile tortoises hatched from first clutches of 4 annual cohorts at the head-start facility at the US Marine Corps Base, Twentynine Palms, California, USA, using non-fatal, endoscopic inspection of gonads. Cohort sexes ranged from 97% females ( : ratio of 6.25:1) in 2008 to 84% males ( : ratio of 0.19:1) in 2009, apparently primarily in response to local weather conditions during the temperature-sensitive phase of incubation. Warmer weather during development of a second clutch laid in 2009 led to fewer males (55%, : ratio of 0.82). Efforts to cool (artificially shade) some nesting burrows were unsuccessful in increasing the proportion of male hatchlings in 2009. Cohort sex ratios were associated with average daily air temperatures during incubation, such that more females were produced during warmer periods, in good agreement with published temperaturecontrolled laboratory experiments. These results suggest that weather played a major role in determining sex ratios, with apparently smaller or negligible influences resulting from initial location, structure and operation of the head-start facility; experimental shading of nests; and individual mothers' variation in the timing of egg laying and placement of nests within the natal burrows. These results, obtained from a remote, mostly natural field site, indicate the potentially great sensitivity of sex determination in nests of wild, free-living desert tortoises to changes in climate.","10.3354/esr00737","CE","CE_10157",246,0.195519417782895,0.192143221125378,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Small vertebrate predators of invertebrates are often characterized as diet generalists based on diet descriptions, but few studies examine prey availability to determine whether prey choice occurs. We studied the prey availability in relation to the diet of two common and abundant, but understudied small vertebrates: Gehyra dubia, an arboreal nocturnal gecko, and Cryptoblepharus australis, an arboreal diurnal skink. We sampled lizards in two major woodland habitat types, Reid River box (Eucalyptus brownii) and Silver-leaf ironbark (Eucalyptus melanophloia) and among four cattle grazing regimes (ranging from moderate  heavy stocking). Cryptoblepharus australis were more abundant in the Silver-leaf ironbark habitat, but there was no effect of grazing regime on their abundance. In contrast, G. dubia did not differ significantly in abundance in relation to habitat type, but were more abundant in paddocks with heavier stocking rates. We quantified invertebrate prey available to lizards in these habitats using defined-area searches and light trapping. Invertebrate community composition did not differ significantly between the habitat types or among the four grazing regimes. Although G. dubia and C. australis both occupied the same microhabitats, they were temporally segregated based on their activity times. While both species are apparently habitat generalists, we found that G. dubia and C. australis are selective in their diets. Only half of the invertebrate groups available in the environment occurred in the diets of either lizard species. Both species positively selected Coleoptera (beetles), Araneae (spiders), and Scorpiones (scorpions), and they exhibited high dietary niche overlap (O = 0.97). We suggest the increased availability of the top three preferred prey groups (beetles, spiders, and scorpions) may contribute to the high abundances of G. dubia in heavily grazed areas.","10.1111/aec.12570","CE","CE_10159",289,0.227499302615304,0.101120792966721,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

10164,2015,"Hooking locations in sea turtles incidentally captured by artisanal longline fisheries in the eastern Pacific Ocean","Fisheries Research","Bycatch by longline fisheries, especially by artisanal small-scale fisheries, is one of the main conservation problems for some sea turtle populations around the world. Since 2004, a network of professionals under the ""Eastern Pacific Regional Sea Turtle Bycatch Program"" have been working with artisanal longline fishers in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) to reduce sea turtle bycatch and related mortality. Trials assessing circle hooks of different sizes and shapes, and different baits, have been conducted to determine the effectiveness in the reduction of sea turtle bycatch and changes in hooking location. In this paper, information from 1823 olive ridley sea turtles incidentally captured in the EPO were analyzed to assess how hook type (J, tuna hooks or circle hooks), hook size, bait type (squid or fish), turtle size and target species (tunas, sharks or mahi-mahi) affect hooking location on sea turtles. This were modeled with a Classification and Regression Tree using hooking location as a multinomial variable response (for 6 categories of hooking locations); and also as a binomial response (swallowed vs. non-swallowed) using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). Hook type and size, plus bait type, were the most important factors affecting hooking location, while turtle size and target species did not have any significant effect. J-hooks and tuna hooks had a much greater probability of being swallowed than circle hooks. In addition, as the hook size increased, the likelihood of swallowing it decreased. The use of fish bait in combination with larger circle hooks tended to produce higher proportions of external hookings. An increase in external or lower mandible hookings is preferred since these locations are assumed to be less dangerous for the animal's post-release survival, and because hooks and attached gear are easier to remove by well-trained fishermen.","10.1016/j.fishres.2014.11.012","CE","CE_10164",294,0.190488865543151,0.0690040566417013,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

In the marine turtles, sex is determined by incubation temperature, such that warming temperatures could lead to a higher production of female hatchlings. By measuring nest temperature, and using a model to relate the incubation temperature to sex ratio, we estimate that Caribbean Colombian leatherback sea turtles currently produce approximately 92% female hatchlings. We modelled the relationship between incubation, sand and air temperature, and under all future climate change scenarios (0.4-6.0 °C warming over the next 100 years), complete feminization could occur, as soon as the next decade. However, male producing refugia exist in the periphery of smaller nests (0.7 °C cooler at the bottom than at the centre), within beaches (0.3 °C cooler in the vegetation line and inter-tidal zone) and between beaches (0.4 °C higher on dark beaches), and these natural refugia could be assigned preferential conservation status. However, there exists a need to develop strategies that may ameliorate deleterious effects of climate-induced temperature changes in the future. We experimentally shaded clutches using screening material, and found that it was effective in reducing nest temperature, producing a higher proportion of male hatchlings, without compromising the fitness or hatching success. Artificial shade in hatcheries is a very useful and simple tool in years or periods of high environmental temperatures. Nevertheless, this is only an emergency response to the severe impacts that will eventually have to be reversed if we are to guarantee the stability of the populations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02532.x","CE","CE_10165",263,0.19060143395786,0.196866531427456,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

In 136 controlled sets of net pairs, buoyless nets reduced mean turtle bycatch rates by 68% while maintaining target catch rates and composition.

Crucial questions regarding the exact timing and place of possible settlement remain unanswered. To examine these issues we radio-tracked during three years 24 tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni) released to reinforce a resident population impacted by fire. Individuals from the resident population (N = 20) and from a distant control population (N = 11) were also radio-tracked. More than 11,000 fixes were collected, enabling us to precisely describe movement patterns. Most translocated tortoises first dispersed (> 500 m to > 3000 m away) in a random direction and sometimes crossed unfavorable areas. Later, a marked shift in movement pattern, from a relatively unidirectional course to multidirectional displacements indicated settlement. Movement patterns of translocated and resident individuals became undistinguishable after settlement. Most individuals settled during the first year after release but several settled in the second year. Mean annual survival rate (> 85%) remained within the range of the species but was lower compared to the resident (93%) and control tortoises (100%). Overall, most translocated individuals (~ 63%) settled and adapted well to their novel environment. This result is essential regarding current controversies that are unfounded and that limit conservation translocations. Yet, translocation sites should be large enough and/or surrounded by secondary favorable areas to limit the mortality associated with dispersal in hazardous environments. Large numbers of individuals rescued during urbanization works may easily supply conservation translocations to reinforce fragile populations.","10.1007/s10531-017-1445-2","CE","CE_10168",232,0.220240719937035,0.0251727572850903,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

In the north-western Sahara shepherds are increasingly building water cisterns of reinforced concrete for watering livestock. These infrastructures attract desert fauna and act as indiscriminate death traps for the amphibians and reptiles (herps) in the surrounding habitats. Here we propose an on-site, cost-effective management measure. We selected two groups of 36 cisterns, managed a group by covering the lateral openings with wire mesh (managed cistern), leaving the other group unmanaged (control cistern). Managed cisterns trapped fewer species, fewer individuals (one third), and individuals of smaller body size and of less conservation concern than did control cisterns. In a multivariate approach by Generalized Mixed Models, the best models explaining the number of species and individuals of herps trapped within cisterns included as the predictor only the management condition, with a trend for higher values in control cisterns.","10.1163/15685381-00003087","CE","CE_10171",148,0.219019334081935,0.0187429654150829,"150","neutral","neutral_150",0
10173,2017,"Remnant vegetation, plantings and fences are beneficial for reptiles in agricultural landscapes","Journal of Applied Ecology","Managing agricultural landscapes for biodiversity conservation is increasingly difficult as land use is modified or intensified for production. Finding ways to mitigate the negative effects of agriculture on biodiversity is therefore critical. We asked the question: How do remnant patches, paddock types and grazing regimes influence reptile assemblages in a grazing landscape? At 12 sites, we surveyed reptiles and environmental covariates in remnant woodland patches and in four paddock types: (i) grazed pasture, (ii) linear plantings, (iii) coarse woody debris (CWD) added to grazed pasture and (iv) fences between grazed pasture. Each site was either continuously or rotationally grazed. Remnant vegetation and other vegetation attributes such as tree cover and leaf litter greatly influenced reptiles. We recorded higher reptile abundance and species richness in areas with more tree cover and leaf litter. For rare species (captured in =4 sites <70 captures), there were 5·7 more animals and 2·6 more species in sites with 50% woody cover within 3 km compared to 5% woody cover. The abundance and richness of rare species, and one common species differed between paddock types and were higher in linear plantings and fence transects compared to CWD and pasture transects. Synthesis and applications. Grazed paddocks, particularly those with key features such as fences and plantings can provide habitat for reptiles. This suggests that discrete differentiation between patch and matrix does not apply for reptiles in these systems. Management to promote reptile conservation in agricultural landscapes should involve protecting existing remnant vegetation, regardless of amount; and promote key habitat features of trees, leaf litter and shrubs. Establishing plantings and fences is important as they support high numbers of less common reptiles and may facilitate reptiles to move through and use greater amounts of the landscape.","10.1111/1365-2664.12923","CE","CE_10173",280,0.302820943012474,0.125243233866144,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

During 2014 and 2015, we head-started and released 145 tortoises, of which we radio-tracked a subset of 41 individuals, from 2 cohorts at 2 release areas within Yuchi Wildlife Management Area in Burke County, Georgia, USA.

Annual survivorship of our second cohort was low (7.1%) at the southeast release area but much higher (75.0%) at the northwest release area because of spatial variation in predation. Although survivorship was variable, site fidelity remained high throughout the study and no tortoise moved >122.0 m from its release location.

Roads are known to negatively impact species, but railways can often cause similar effects. Certain taxa, such as turtles and tortoises, are more vulnerable to railways than others due to limitations in mobility. We studied the impact of rails on the movement and behavior of Gopher Tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus), a threatened, highly terrestrial species likely in frequent contact with railways. First, we used radio-telemetry to determine the frequency of railway crossings and compared this to correlated random walk (CRW) simulations to assess if tortoises were crossing the rails less frequently than is expected by unconstrained movement. Second, we placed tortoises into the railway and measured behavior for one hour to assess crossing ability. Lastly, we tested whether trenches dug underneath the rails could allow safe passage for tortoises. We found that railways impacted the movement of Gopher Tortoises. Gopher Tortoises crossed the railway less often than what would be expected by unhindered movement for five of our ten tortoises tracked. During behavioral trials, 0 of 24 tortoises placed within the railways were capable of escaping from the rails. Using game cameras, we detected tortoises using trenches dug underneath the rails and between the ties 68 times over the course of a single summer. For minimal financial cost, the trenches facilitated tortoise movement across the railway, maintained full rail functionality, and created an escape route for individuals that were trapped between the rails, and thus should be implemented as a mitigation strategy. Given the thousands of km of railways around the world, we recommend future studies focus on the new field of rail ecology.","10.1643/CE-17-635","CE","CE_10217",283,0.191241691752255,-0.0199125153052747,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Here we present the results of an artificial incubation programme started in 2007 to protect the clutches from human predation. A preliminary survey in 2006 showed that about 60% of clutches laid were taken by humans. Over the study period (2007-2010) we recorded 400 clutches, of which 38.2% were predated by humans, 40.7% were artificially incubated and 21% were incubated in situ. Overall, the artificial incubation programme allowed the release of 12,340 hatchlings. No differences were found in hatching and emergence success between clutches incubated in situ and clutches artificially incubated. However, incubation temperatures and incubation durations recorded suggest a male-biased hatchling sex-ratio in artificially incubated clutches. Although artificial incubation may mitigate the effect of egg take, our results indicate that other measures, such as clutch relocation to protected sections of the beach should be taken. Beach patrolling and education are currently implemented so that artificial incubation will be eventually phased out in favour of in situ incubation.

This nesting aggregation is threatened by widespread illegal egg take, and clutch relocation and artificial incubation have been carried out as protection measures since 1974. We assess the efficacy of such efforts and investigate how artificial incubation may be influencing the success and sex ratios of clutches. We compare hatching success, incubation duration and embryo mortality in in-situ clutches (nÂ =Â 43) with those incubated artificially at sites in the east and west of the Park (nÂ =Â 35 and nÂ =Â 31, respectively). Our results show that in the west, artificial incubation significantly decreases hatching success in clutches. In the east the duration of incubation is increased, which we predict would result in an increase in the number of males from these clutches. Clutch relocation is currently the only viable conservation option for clutches on eastern beaches because of illegal egg take but action is needed to ensure that the natural sex ratio is not distorted. However, on the western beaches in situ clutch incubation seems possible through beach protection. Further community engagement and enforcement are required to improve conservation measures at eastern beaches if long-term, less sustainable intervention is to be avoided.","10.1017/s0030605313001488","CE","CE_10220",217,0.229986154914944,0.228828538772257,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Wildlife differs in their responses to urbanization depending upon species and site-specific factors. We used capture-mark-recapture to examine the abundance, population demographics, growth, and movements of the eastern long-necked turtle (Chelodina longicollis) in Australia over 1 year in a suburban environment and an adjacent nature reserve during drought. Contrary to expectations, sex ratios, injury incidence, and frequency of juvenile size classes did not differ between turtles in the suburbs and the nature reserve. Moreover, turtles in the suburbs were nearly 3 times more abundant, grew 5 times faster, and had populations comprised of more adults in the larger size classes than nature reserve populations. These findings, together with net movements from the nature reserves into the suburbs, suggest that suburban water bodies were the higher quality habitat, effectively buffering turtles from temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions during drought. However, reserve managers and urban planners need to recognize that suburban water bodies have the potential to attract turtles from nearby reserves during drought, and that even low levels of persistent mortality during these travels across reserve boundaries may have consequences for populations of long-lived vertebrates. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.219","CE","CE_10221",202,0.242587368724088,0.0848122750066753,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The present paper reports marine turtle bycatch composition and rates from a Portuguese commercial longline fishery targeting swordfish in the South Atlantic, and investigates the effects of changes in hook style and bait type. In total, 310 longline sets were carried out between 2008 and 2012. Three different hook styles were tested, traditional J hook (9/0) and two 17/0 circle hooks (a non-offset and a 10o offset), but only one bait type was used in each set (Scomber spp. or Illex spp.). Two species of sea turtles were caught, the leatherback Dermochelys coriacea, and the loggerhead Caretta caretta, the latter comprising the majority of the catches. The highest mean bycatch per unit of effort values for both species combined (1.693/1000 hooks) and for the individual species (1.505/1000 hooks for loggerheads) occurred with J-style hooks baited with squid. Changing from J-style to one of the circle hooks was only significant when using squid bait (with the odds-ratios decreasing between 54% and 63%). Hooking location was species-specific, with most loggerheads hooked by the mouth, while leatherbacks were mostly hooked externally by the flippers. Overall, 65% of all sea turtles were released alive (85% for leatherbacks compared with 63% for loggerheads). Significant reduction of sea turtle accidental catches on the swordfish longline fisheries can be achieved by changing the J hooks to circle hooks, especially if baited with mackerel. However, such gain is species-specific and area dependent. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","10.1002/aqc.2324","CE","CE_10226",247,0.165734188738542,-0.0694884254023882,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Coarse woody debris (CWD) is a critical resource for a whole suite of animal taxa but remains an underappreciated component of some forest ecosystems and restoration activities. The extent to which recovery of animal communities can be accelerated through artificial supplementation of woody debris is poorly understood especially for highly diverse tropical forest systems. Here, we report early results from an experiment designed to manipulate CWD in young restoration plantings (0-7 year old) in tropical north-east Australia for the purposes of facilitating re-establishment of rainforest reptiles. After 1 year, we demonstrate that CWD addition within restoration plantings adjacent to remnant forest can increase the local abundance of reptiles and promote colonisation of the log-specialist Prickly Skink (Gnypetoscincus queenslandiae). These preliminary results, however, are based on observations of just 44 individual reptiles encompassing seven species. Ongoing monitoring will elucidate longer-term outcomes to enable a proper evaluation of when and where CWD addition might be most beneficial in realising restoration goals. © 2014 Ecological Society of Australia.","10.1111/emr.12079","CE","CE_10231",195,0.263280848988173,0.0244751185517534,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

The success of these programs depends on increasing population numbers while maintaining fitness within populations that contain some captive-reared individuals. As part of an ongoing conservation project with Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) in Saginaw, Michigan, USA, the Detroit Zoological Society (DZS) headstarted Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) to 18 months of age. To determine survival, movements, and habitat use of these headstarted Blanding's turtles, we externally attached radio-transmitters to 24 turtles and released them at 4 sites in release groups of 6 along a transect in a wetland within SNWR during June 2014. We located turtles weekly during the active season (MaySep) and every 2 weeks during the inactive season (OctApr) for 18 months, starting immediately after release and ending November 2015. We calculated straight-line distances between release sites and home range centers over the study period. We examined habitat use of the turtles in relation to habitat availability. To predict movement of headstarted Blanding's turtles away from release sites, we used geographically weighted regression (GWR) with measured habitat factors and release sites as independent variables. There were differences in home range sizes across release groups but not between years. Headstarted juvenile Blanding's turtles in this study have home range sizes similar to those measured in other studies for wild-hatched juveniles but smaller home ranges than those measured for wild-hatched adults. Our study showed that headstarted Blanding's turtles used habitats with muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) dens and cattails (Typha spp.) more than proportionally available, and used open water, willows (Salix spp.), and lowland forest less than proportionally available. The GWR model was able to predict habitat characteristics (water depth and temperature, duckweed [Lemna minor], cattails, muskrat dens and fields, buttonbush [Cephalanthus occidentalis]) that influenced the movement of turtles away from the release sites. The habitat coefficient's influence on movement varied in relation to the current location of the turtle and as habitat characteristics increased or decreased. Turtle distance from release sites decreased as water depth, water temperature, and duckweed increased, and increased as cattails, muskrat dens and fields, and buttonbush increased. Habitat in the small spatial extent at release sites may affect movement of headstarted Blanding's turtles. Furthermore, this study uses novel methodologies for assessing headstart programs that can aid future conservation and management efforts by providing information on habitat use and movement patterns of headstarted Blanding's turtles after release. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21530","CE","CE_10234",408,0.22236792508186,0.217488170301065,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Then, we examined reptile assemblages after all sites experienced more than a decade of prescribed burning at two- to thee-year return intervals. Data were collected concurrently at reference sites chosen to represent target conditions for restoration. Reptile assemblages changed most rapidly in response to prescribed burning, but reptile assemblages at all sites, including reference sites, were generally indistinguishable by the end of the study. Thus, we suggest that prescribed burning in longleaf pine forests over long time periods is an effective strategy for restoring reptile assemblages to the reference condition.

We conducted a field experiment to evaluate the impact of feral cats on terrestrial vertebrates in tropical savanna environments of northern Australia. Three experimental treatments were applied to six 64 ha plots to compare and contrast responses of reptile abundance and species richness to predator exclusion and the additive effects of frequent fire. Replicated pitfall-trapping was undertaken in each plot on seven sampling occasions between November 2013 and November 2015. We analysed relative abundance and species richness data using generalized linear mixed models. There was a significant increase in the abundance of reptiles over a two year period in cat-excluded plots with reptile abundance increasing at twice the rate in cat-exclusion plots compared with cat-accessible plots and there was an additive effect of time-since-fire. Cat exclusion had a positive effect on reptile species richness over time, however the evidence for this pattern was weak when seasonal variation was taken into account.

Methods to reduce turtle bycatch and mortality must strike a balance between bycatch reduction and target species retention if they are to gain acceptance from fishers. To investigate potential bycatch reduction measures, we examined the effects of hook size, bait type, baiting technique, and animal size on the frequency of loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta ingesting a baited hook during controlled trials. Results indicated that as hook size increased, the likelihood for deep ingestion decreased. Smaller turtles were less likely to swallow larger hooks. Turtles were less likely to swallow hooks baited with sardines than with squid and single-baited rather than threaded baits. Results are likely due to differences in bait texture, hook shielding effects, and turtles' behavioral differences. We suggest that fishing with large hooks, using finfish instead of squid, and using single-baited instead of threaded baits might reduce deep ingestion rates of hooks by loggerheads as large as 65 cm in standard straight carapace length (notch to tip). © Inter-Research 2011.","10.3354/esr00339","CE","CE_10239",182,0.181340584306241,0.00610698445840756,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Studying lizards under controlled laboratory conditions is a useful method for evaluating the relative effects of phenotypic plasticity and underlying genetic constraints on variable reproductive parameters. Therefore, there is a need to determine the best techniques for maintaining various species under laboratory conditions to avoid biasing data as much as possible. The purpose of our study was to determine if housing female Western Fence Lizards, Sceloporus occidentalis, in different sized breeding groups increased variability in reproductive parameters. We randomly assigned each of 96 healthy females to a control or one of three different sized groups, i.e. one female per cage (control), two females per cage, four females per cage, and eight females per cage. One male was randomly assigned to each cage. There were no statistical differences between the controls and females in the two-female groups for any parameter measured. Housing females in four-and eight-female groups decreased the mean number of clutches laid by females and decreased reproductive effort in terms of relative clutch mass (clutch mass divided by maternal body mass). Housing four or eight females together also increased the number of days before the first clutch was laid and increased the percentage of infertile eggs per clutch. © 2013. Larry Talent.

10247,2016,"The relative influence of in situ and neighborhood factors on reptile recolonization in post-mining restoration sites","Restoration Ecology","Restoration can be important in slowing, or reducing, rates of biodiversity loss, but needs to consider the factors influencing fauna recolonization as part of the recovery process. Although many studies of factors influencing faunal recolonization have examined the influence of in situ site factors, fewer have examined the influence of neighborhood landscape factors, especially in landscapes with permeable matrices. To assess the relative influence of landscape and site factors on reptile recolonization in a production landscape with a permeable matrix, we surveyed reptiles at intact reference sites and post-mining restoration sites (320 years post-mining [YPM]) in a forest ecosystem in southwestern Australia. Reptile assemblages in restoration sites never converged on those in reference habitat. Reptile species composition and individual species abundances (>20 detections) in restoration sites were primarily influenced by site factors such as canopy height, litter cover, and coarse woody debris volume, and not by landscape factors. We suggest that the most common reptile species in our study area are primarily influenced by site factors, not landscape factors, and most reptiles detected in restoration sites were present by 34 YPM. Therefore, it is likely that habitat suitability is the main barrier to most species' recolonization of restoration sites in landscapes with permeable matrices. Management should continue to focus on restoring microhabitats and vegetation structure, which is similar to reference habitat to promote recolonization of restoration sites by reptiles.","10.1111/rec.12340","CE","CE_10247",228,0.249208775599775,0.091299040256333,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

An ethnozoological approach was used to analyze people's attitudes and perceptions on the effectiveness of conservation programs for these species and to identify conservation measures that would contribute to turtle population sustainability. Available statistics on turtle trade were also used as complementary information. We interviewed local residents who were exposed (n = 50) and not exposed (n = 50) to turtle conservation initiatives. When evaluating the two focal turtle species, we found differences in direct use between people exposed and not exposed to conservation programs, where people exposed to conservation initiatives made less direct use of these focal species. However, when other sympatric turtle species were considered, there were no significant differences in levels of turtle exploitation between people exposed and not exposed to conservation programs. Thus, successfully reducing the consumption of a focal turtle species might lead to an increased use of other local turtle species. Almost all interviewed locals were aware of turtle population declines, with the perceived most serious risk to turtle species reported being habitat loss and degradation followed by human consumption. Regarding turtle trade, we did not find significant differences between the two groups. Illegal trade levels in 2010 were 6.5 greater compared to 2016. We propose several new directions for turtle management and conservation of these species.","10.1177/1940082918779069","CE","CE_10251",243,0.477978734735807,0.0764310065134752,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

This endangered subspecies is found within the Albera Nature Reserve, where this study was performed. We selected three formerly high-density tortoise areas to carry out different trials whose aims were to: (1) identify nest predator species, (2) test the success of reducing the shrub cover to reduce nest predation in potential new nesting areas, and (3) assess fencing efficiency to exclude predators. For the first objective, camera-trapping was used to identify nest predators, with sardines and artificial tortoise nests as lures. We obtained 825 pictures of possible predators and demonstrated that the beech marten was the most abundant predator in the study areas, followed by the badger and the wild boar. For the second objective, predation of artificial nests was compared between plots managed for shrub reduction (27 plots of 4, 25, and 100 m2) and a natural nesting area (nine control plots of 100 m2). Predation was strong in the managed plots (43. 6% after 48 h and 99. 6% after 144 h) but highest in the control area (100% after 48 h). Surprisingly, predation occurred at an even faster pace when we repeated the trial with a single artificial nest (in order to reduce odor intensity). Finally, we compared predation rates between eight fenced and eight unfenced plots of 100 m2. Fencing was partially effective to control nest predation because it excluded all the main predator species except the beech marten, which learned to go through it. Since the nest predation threat to this endangered population is critical, new strategies are needed to control nest predation by taking into account the ability of predators to learn nest location. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","10.1007/s10344-012-0620-8","CE","CE_10254",289,0.168900065744251,0.0981553334346994,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10255,2015,"Knowledge of habitat preferences applied to habitat management: the case of an endangered tortoise population","Amphibia-Reptilia","To avoid the possible extinction of the last native population of western Hermann's tortoise in the Iberian Peninsula it is essential to make sound management decisions. Knowledge of macro and microhabitat use and home range size has considerable practical value for land managers. With this aim we first studied the home range and habitat preferences in western Hermann's tortoises by radio tracking 15 adults weekly from March 2008 to May 2009 in three localities within the Albera population range (NE Iberian Peninsula). We estimated home ranges with Fixed Kernel estimator (FK) and Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) after checking tortoise site fidelity. We observed that home range size did not differ significantly between males and females (mean FK = 2.01 ha, mean MCP = 3.01 ha). Secondly, we studied macrohabitat selection using a vegetation map. Preferred habitats were open shrubland, open forest and barren land during the activity period, and dense forest, dense shrubland and open shrubland during the hibernation. Next, we assessed microhabitat selection along five periods of the annual cycle: hibernation, emergence from hibernation, spring, summer and autumn. We then located marked tortoises weekly and classified the plant species observed in each location. Principal component analyses showed that tortoises selected shrubs with trees during hibernation, bramble during summer and herbaceous habitat during the breeding season. All these results can provide guidelines for management programs that set aside areas of habitat critical to conserve viable populations, although it is also important to prevent mortality from forestry works. We therefore tested a new brush cutter head accessory to achieve tortoise-safe undergrowth clearing. To this aim we distributed 52 frozen hybrid tortoises among eight plots of 100 m2, cleared six of these plots with the accessory and two without it, and evaluated the scars of the blade on caparaces. We observed no damage in plots that were cleared with the accessory but scars in most carapaces in the plots cleared without it (with potential mortality ranging from 40% in neonates to 100% in adults). These results outline the importance of supporting habitat management decisions with proper field studies.","10.1163/15685381-00002971","CE","CE_10255",336,0.323287305375016,0.185762401766583,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
10256,2018,"Can ultraviolet illumination reduce sea turtle bycatch in Mediterranean set net fisheries?","Fisheries Research","Sea turtles suffer from the cumulative and synergistic effects of natural phenomena and human activities. Among the latter, incidental interaction with commercial fisheries is considered as the main threat to their conservation. Fixed nets are common gears traditionally used in Mediterranean small scale fisheries (SSF). The loggerhead turtle bycatch of fixed nets is estimated to be high and similar to that of trawl nets and longlines, but seems to be associated with higher mortality rates. Devices aiming at reducing sea turtle bycatch through gear modifications have largely been developed for large-scale commercial fisheries, i.e. longlines and trawls, but not for set nets. In the present study ultraviolet LED lamps, which have already proved to be effective visual deterrents along the Northern and Southern Pacific coasts, were mounted on fixed nets and assessed for their ability to reduce the loggerhead turtle bycatch in the Mediterranean set net fishery. No turtles were caught in the illuminated net, whereas 16 individuals were captured by the traditional net (mortality rate, 30%). There were no significant differences in the catch rates of target species. This is the first test of a BRD designed to reduce sea turtle bycatch in a Mediterranean set net fishery. A broad diffusion of these bycatch reducer devices (BRDs) would provide a significant contribution to the conservation of loggerhead turtles while enabling large-scale production and cost reduction. However, until this happens the cost of adopting this BRD cannot be afforded by the fishermen operating SSF.","10.1016/j.fishres.2017.11.012","CE","CE_10256",245,0.248283687741638,0.133439684961079,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
10262,2018,"Fire-disturbed landscapes induce phenotypic plasticity in lizard locomotor performance","Journal of Zoology","Phenotypic plasticity can occur in response to environmental fluctuation and can bring about pronounced changes in behavioral, physiological, or morphological traits. Anthropogenic habitat modifications, such as prescribed fire, can provide insight on the phenotypic response of ectotherms to structural habitat change. Our objective was to quantify the effect of fire-altered landscapes on the locomotor performance of the eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Lizard sprint performance was compared among three habitats with different fire histories: a control habitat, which had not experienced fire in more than 60 years, a recovering habitat that had not experienced fire in 4 years, and a recent burn habitat that burned less than 6 months prior to the study. There were significant differences in locomotor performance among lizards from the different habitats (indicative of phenotypic plasticity), and lizards in the recent burn habitat had significantly higher maximum sprint speeds than lizards in recovering and control habitats. To measure the consistency of locomotor performance within individuals, lizards were captured and raced during the field seasons of 2014 and again in 2015. Locomotor performance was significantly repeatable across years, suggesting lizard populations contain considerable individual variation, despite this trait being closely tied to fitness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to observe individual between-year repeatability in performance of free-ranging S. undulatus. Lizards had similar body condition among habitats suggesting that nutritional status did not play a role in performance plasticity. Habitats differed both structurally and thermally, and less restrictive thermal regimes in recently burned habitats appear to be the underlying mechanism permitting increased lizard locomotor performance.","10.1111/jzo.12545","CE","CE_10262",261,0.213599993927698,0.162895421465311,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10263,2017,"Hypoxia as a novel method for preventing movement-induced mortality during translocation of turtle eggs","Biological Conservation","Relocation of turtle eggs for research or conservation purposes is associated with significant risk, because they are prone to movement-induced mortality resulting from damage to embryonic membranes. Hypoxic incubation of eggs after oviposition maintains embryos in pre-ovipositional embryonic arrest and delays development. Whether or not this extended developmental pause also delays the onset of sensitivity to movement-induced mortality remains unknown. In previous studies eggs have been incubated in hypoxia using heavy and expensive Perspex chambers. We tested whether extending pre-ovipositional embryonic arrest through hypoxic incubation protects embryos from movement-induced mortality and we investigated more practical and cost-effective methods for transporting eggs under hypoxic conditions. Olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) eggs were randomly divided among four different treatments after oviposition; a control (normoxic) treatment, Perspex containers or ziplock bags filled with nitrogen gas, or vacuum-sealed bags. Eggs remained in their respective treatment for three days before being removed from their container or bag and placed into artificial incubators. Some eggs from each treatment were inverted when removed from their respective treatment in order to test their susceptibility to movement-induced mortality. We found a reduction in hatching success in the hypoxic treatments (2043%) compared with the control (68%). However, all methods of hypoxic incubation delayed development and protected against movement-induced mortality. We conclude that plastic bags filled with nitrogen or vacuum bags can be used for maintenance of hypoxia in turtle eggs, thus providing a simple and cost-effective method for transportation of eggs for conservation and research purposes.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.10.009","CE","CE_10263",255,0.326197982281144,-0.0155539305068897,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10265,2011,"Ex situ conservation genetics: a review of molecular studies on the genetic consequences of captive breeding programmes for endangered animal species","Biodiversity and Conservation","Captive breeding has become an important tool in species conservation programmes. Current management strategies for ex situ populations are based on theoretical models, which have mainly been tested in model species or assessed using studbook data. During recent years an increasing number of molecular genetic studies have been published on captive populations of several endangered species. However, a comprehensive analysis of these studies is still outstanding. Here, we present a review of the published literature on ex situ conservation genetics with a focus on molecular studies. We analysed 188 publications which either presented empirical studies using molecular markers (105), studbook analyses (26), theoretical work (38), or tested the genetic effects of management strategies using model species (19). The results show that inbreeding can be minimized by a thorough management of captive populations. There seems to be a minimum number of founders (15) and a minimum size of a captive population (100) necessary in order to minimize a loss of genetic diversity. Optimally, the founders should be unrelated and new founders should be integrated into the captive population successively. We recommend that genetic analyses should generally precede and accompany ex situ conservation projects in order to avoid inbreeding and outbreeding depression. Furthermore, many of the published studies do not provide all the relevant parameters (founder size, captive population size, Ho, He, inbreeding coefficients). We, therefore, propose that a general standard for the presentation of genetic studies should be established, which would allow integration of the data into a global database. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10531-011-0074-4","CE","CE_10265",248,0.309478758941743,0.114604224398266,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
10266,2018,"Rodent, snake and raptor use of restored native perennial grasslands is lower than use of unrestored exotic annual grasslands","Journal of Applied Ecology","In California's Central Valley, most native grasslands have been destroyed or degraded due to invasion, farming and development. Grassland restoration is often assumed to provide improved wildlife habitat, ostensibly increasing the abundance and diversity of at least some native wildlife species relative to unrestored, invaded annual grasslands. We compared rodent, snake and raptor activity and species richness at paired unrestored and restored grasslands across four blocked locations in the Central Valley using trapping and observational surveys in up to four seasons per guild from 2014 to 2015. Restored treatments were planted with native perennial grasses 1324 years prior to study initiation but were partially re-invaded by Mediterranean annual grasses and forbs. Unrestored treatments contained similar non-native plant species assemblages as restored treatments, but did not contain any native grass. Rodent, snake and raptor activity was generally higher in unrestored relative to restored treatments. For rodents, the non-native Mus musculus (house mouse) showed the greatest disparity in abundance, while greater raptors and snakes likely responded to greater rodent abundance. Within treatments, species-specific rodent responses were related to structure of physical vegetation. In particular, Peromyscus maniculatus (native deer mouse) was associated with more bare ground and shorter vegetation, while the house mouse was associated with less bare ground and taller vegetation, regardless of treatment type. Substantial changes in rodent species composition were observed over short periods of time (<3 months) after unplanned manipulation of vegetation structure via livestock grazing, with patterns reflecting the species-specific response to physical vegetation structure. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that while grassland restoration may promote persistence of native plant communities, restoration may not be beneficial to some higher trophic levels, and in fact may reduce habitat value for some native predators in grasslands invaded by Mediterranean plant species. Changes in vegetation structure can strongly impact wildlife species composition, suggesting a more nuanced approach is required for the restoration of desired wildlife communities. Thus, species-specific goals should be carefully considered to ensure improved alignment of restoration methods with expected restoration outcomes.","10.1111/1365-2664.12990","CE","CE_10266",336,0.353249638120982,0.0543239327224614,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Translocated snakes experience modified behaviours, spatial use and survivorship, and few studies have investigated the impacts of translocation within a metropolitan area. Aims In the present study, we investigated the impacts of translocation on the most commonly encountered snake in Perth Western Australia, the dugite (Pseudonaja affinis, Elapidae), by comparing the space use of resident and translocated snakes. Methods We captured 10 dugites and attached telemetry packages, composed of a radio-telemetry transmitter and global positioning system (GPS) data-logger, externally to their tails. Snakes were either released within 200 m of their initial capture sites (residents, n = 6) or moved to new unconnected habitat at least 3 km away (translocated, n = 4). Spatial-use data were analysed using general linear models to identify differences between resident and translocated dugites. Key results Translocation influenced space use of dugites and detrimentally affected their survivorship. Translocated snakes had larger activity ranges than did residents, and there was a trend towards travelling greater distances over time. Mortality for all snakes was high: 100% for translocated snakes, and 50% for residents. Conclusions Urban dugites face many threats, and snakes were negatively affected by translocation. The GPS technology we used did not improve the quality of the data over traditional radio-telemetry methods, owing to the cryptic nature of the snakes that spent much of their time under cover or underground. Implications These findings support the growing body of evidence that translocating 'problem' snakes is a not a humane method of animal management, and alternatives such as public education, may be more appropriate.","10.1071/WR17166","CE","CE_10267",273,0.174584626292713,-0.0161840252319749,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10268,2014,"Sun exposure, nest temperature and loggerhead turtle hatchlings: implications for beach shading management strategies at sea turtle rookeries","Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","Sea turtle incubation biology is tightly linked to nest thermal conditions due to the effect temperature has on hatching success, sex determination, morphology and locomotion performance. Because of this relationship between nest temperature and hatchling outcomes, global warming presents an immediate threat to many sea turtle nesting beaches throughout the world. Even small rises in nest temperatures may skew sex ratios and, raise egg mortality and influence hatchling phenotypes adversely, impacting on hatchling recruitment and ultimately species survival at some rookeries. The development of adaptive management practices capable of minimizing the effects of increasing global temperature on nest temperatures is thus a priority for animals exhibiting temperature-dependent sex-determination, such as sea turtles. Here, the relationship between solar radiation exposure and nest temperatures at the Mon Repos turtle rookery, south east Queensland, Australia was explored and the relationship between nest temperature and hatchling attributes examined. Shading decreased nest temperature, and higher nest temperatures were associated with smaller sized hatchlings that had decreased locomotion performance. The use of shading to minimize nest temperature is a management strategy that may be used to mitigate detrimental effects of increased global temperatures at some rookeries. Here, we explored the viability of natural shading options, such as the planting of trees behind nesting beaches, for combating the adverse effect of increased nest temperature caused by increased air temperatures.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.jembe.2013.11.005","CE","CE_10268",227,0.240805390970659,0.163508697057759,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
10272,2014,"Effects of habitat alteration on lizard community and food web structure in a desert steppe ecosystem","Biological Conservation","Habitat alteration has major impacts on biodiversity, but we do not fully understand how changes in vegetation structure alter community interactions among vertebrate predators and their prey. Desertification is a major threat to degraded steppe habitats, prompting re-vegetation efforts to slow wind erosion. These processes alter both the structure and composition of the vegetation, and thus could influence predator and prey abundances, and their interactions. We investigated how habitat structure (degraded [sparse], natural [intermediate], or re-vegetated [dense]) influences lizard species richness, abundance, and diversity, and the interactions between these predators and invertebrate prey in the arid desert steppe. Structurally sparse and dense vegetation supported higher lizard abundances than natural habitats, with Phrynocephalus frontalis and Eremias argus dominating sparse and dense habitats respectively, and P. frontalis and E. multiocellata co-dominating natural habitats. Habitats that were structurally dense also supported the most complex trophic interactions among predators and prey, whereas structurally sparse habitats had low interaction diversity and interaction evenness, with most energy flowing along few trophic pathways. Steppe degradation therefore simplifies community trophic interactions, and restoration through enhanced protection of natural steppe habitat structure may play an important role in the conservation of healthy predator-prey communities. Desertification is a pressing issue throughout most of the arid steppe; revegetation efforts resulted in robust communities, in addition to promoting persistence of E. argus, which is endemic and threatened. Maintaining a heterogenous structural landscape thus may be the most promising way to combat desertification while at the same time restoring predator-prey community composition.","10.1016/j.biocon.2014.09.011","CE","CE_10272",254,0.420359878804942,-0.047200901469101,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10282,2015,"Assessing the effectiveness of the BirdsbesafeÂ® anti-predation collar cover in reducing predation on wildlife by pet cats in Western Australia","Applied Animal Behaviour Science","Many pet cats hunt and, irrespective of whether or not this threatens wildlife populations, distressed owners may wish to curtail hunting while allowing their pets to roam. Therefore we evaluated the effectiveness of three patterned designs (simple descriptions being rainbow, red and yellow) of the anti-predation collar cover, the Birdsbesafe® (BBS), in reducing prey captures by 114 pet cats over 2 years in a suburban Australian context. The BBS offers a colourful indicator of a cat's presence and should therefore alert prey with good colour vision (birds and herpetofauna), but not most mammals with limited colour vision. We also interviewed the 82 owners of cats in the study about their experience using the BBS and their assessment of the behavioural responses of their cats. In the first year of the study, which focused on the effectiveness of different BBS colours, captures of prey with good colour vision were reduced by 54% (95% CL 43-64%) when cats were wearing a BBS of any colour, with the rainbow and red BBS more effective than the yellow when birds were prey. Captures of mammals were not reduced significantly. The second year assessed the rainbow BBS alone, and those data combined with rainbow data in the first year found a significant reduction of 47% (95% CL 43-57%) in capture of prey with good colour vision, with no effect of differences across years. We found no evidence that cats maintained a lower predation rate once the BBS was removed. Seventy-nine per cent of owners reported that their cats had no problems with the BBS and another 17% reported that their cats adjusted within 2 days. Fourteen owners reported that their cats spent more time at home and ate more while wearing the BBS. Two owners reported their cats stayed away from home more while wearing it. Sixty-four per cent of owners using the red collar, 48% using rainbow and 46% using yellow believed that it worked. Overall, 77% of owners planned to continue using the BBS after the study had finished. The BBS is an option for owners wishing to reduce captures of birds and herpetofauna by free-ranging cats, especially where mammalian prey are introduced pests. To date, the BBS is the only predation deterrent that reduces significantly the number of herpetofauna brought home. It is unsuitable where endangered mammalian prey or large invertebrates are vulnerable to predation by pet cats.","10.1016/j.applanim.2015.01.004","CE","CE_10282",386,0.248258493641462,0.0268197656029481,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1
10284,2013,"Evaluating the role of fire disturbance in structuring small reptile communities in temperate forests","Biodiversity and Conservation","Fire is an integral disturbance shaping forest community dynamics over large scales. However, understanding the relationship between fire induced habitat disturbance and biodiversity remain equivocal. Ecological theories including the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) and the habitat accommodation model (HAM) offer predictive frameworks that could explain faunal responses to fire disturbances. We used an 80 year post-fire chronosequence to investigate small reptile community responses to fires in temperate forests across 74 sites. First, we evaluated if changes in species richness, abundance and evenness post-fire followed trends of prior predictions, including the IDH. Second, using competing models of fine scale habitat elements we evaluated the specific ways which fire influenced small reptiles. Third, we evaluated support for the HAM by examining compositional changes of reptile community post-fire. Relative abundance was positively correlated to age post-fire while richness and evenness showed no associations. The abundance trend was as expected based on the prior prediction of sustained population increase post-disturbance, but the trend for richness contradicted the prediction of highest diversity at intermediate levels of disturbance (according to IDH). Abundance changes were driven mainly by changes in overstorey, ground layer, and shelter, while richness and evenness did not associate with any vegetation parameter. Community composition was not strongly correlated to age since fire, thus support for the HAM was weak. Overall, in this ecosystem, frequent fire disturbances can be detrimental to small reptiles. Future studies utilizing approaches based on species traits could enhance our understanding of biodiversity patterns post-disturbance. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","10.1007/s10531-013-0519-z","CE","CE_10284",254,0.213134025579134,0.0907736344116127,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Mitigating for the ecological consequences of large herbivore losses through the use of ecological replacements to fill extinct species' niches and thereby replicate missing ecological functions has been proposed. It is unknown how different morphologically and ecologically a replacement can be from the extinct species and still provide similar functions. We studied niche equivalency between 2 phenotypes of Galápagos giant tortoises (domed and saddlebacked) that were translocated to Pinta Island in the Galápagos Archipelago as ecological replacements for the extinct saddlebacked giant tortoise (Chelonoidis abingdonii). Thirty-nine adult, nonreproductive tortoises were introduced to Pinta Island in May 2010, and we observed tortoise resource use in relation to phenotype during the first year following release. Domed tortoises settled in higher, moister elevations than saddlebacked tortoises, which favored lower elevation arid zones. The areas where the tortoises settled are consistent with the ecological conditions each phenotype occupies in its native range. Saddlebacked tortoises selected areas with high densities of the arboreal prickly pear cactus (Opuntia galapageia) and mostly foraged on the cactus, which likely relied on the extinct saddlebacked Pinta tortoise for seed dispersal. In contrast, domed tortoises did not select areas with cactus and therefore would not provide the same seed-dispersal functions for the cactus as the introduced or the original, now extinct, saddlebacked tortoises. Interchangeability of extant megaherbivores as replacements for extinct forms therefore should be scrutinized given the lack of equivalency we observed in closely related forms of giant tortoises. Our results also demonstrate the value of trial introductions of sterilized individuals to test niche equivalency among candidate analog species. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/cobi.12038","CE","CE_10285",289,0.264537023972017,-0.0391398865411927,"300","neutral","neutral_300",1
10286,2014,"Reptiles in restored agricultural landscapes: the value of linear strips, patches and habitat condition","Animal Conservation","Habitat restoration, including revegetation of linear strips and enlargement of remnant patches, may benefit native fauna in highly fragmented landscapes. Such restoration has occurred around the world, even though the relative importance of strips and patches of vegetation remains controversial. Using reptile communities from south-eastern Australia, we assessed the conservation value of revegetation in strips and alongside remnant patches compared with remnant vegetation and cleared roadsides. We also examined the distance that reptiles occurred from remnant patches into linear vegetation. We found that reptile species richness and counts did not substantially differ between revegetated, remnant and cleared habitats, or between linear strip and patch treatments. This may indicate that species sensitive to land clearing have already been lost from the landscape. These results imply that if specialist species have already been lost, we may be unable to measure the effects of agriculture on biodiversity. Furthermore, revegetation with the expectation that fauna will recolonize may be unrealistic and translocations may be necessary. Unexpectedly, we recorded higher species richness and counts of rare reptile species in remnant linear strips as distance from remnant patches increased. Ground-layer attributes were important for increasing reptile species richness and counts and in structuring reptile communities, explaining approximately three times as much variation as remnant shape or vegetation type (remnant, revegetated, cleared). Management agencies should protect and effectively manage remnant linear strips if rarer reptiles are to be retained, paying particular attention to ground-layer attributes. The decision to include ground layers in future revegetation activities will be more important than the shape of restored areas.","10.1111/acv.12121","CE","CE_10286",261,0.291709692651627,0.108054699963901,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10295,2014,"How effective are agri-environment schemes for protecting and improving herpetofaunal diversity in Australian endangered woodland ecosystems?","Journal of Applied Ecology","Summary: Agricultural intensification is a major cause of reptile and amphibian decline world-wide, prompting concern on how to best protect biodiversity in commodity production landscapes and meet global food demands. Agri-environment schemes (AES) attempt to integrate biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes but are often compromised by a lack of baseline data, monitoring and evaluation. Few studies have examined the benefits of AES in protecting biodiversity relative to the wider farming landscape, and no studies have explicitly quantified the effectiveness of AES to increase herpetofaunal diversity. To examine whether AES protect and increase herpetofauna, we established a landscape-wide biodiversity monitoring programme in threatened semi-arid and temperate woodland communities in south-eastern Australia. With 31 species recorded, regional herpetofaunal diversity was relatively high, whereas local diversity was low. Herpetofaunal richness and reptile assemblage structure did not differ significantly between sites under AES and sites managed for livestock production. A gradient in species richness as a function of time-since-management intervention was not evident, although the abundance of one lizard species increased under vegetation management. Reptile richness and frog abundance differed significantly among vegetation types. Herpetofaunal richness was positively related to native plant richness and bare ground cover, whereas Boulenger's skink Morethia boulengeri was negatively affected by bare ground cover. The ragged snake-eyed skink Cryptoblepharus pannosus was positively related to the amount of woody debris. Synthesis and applications. In this system, strong habitat specificity implies local-scale management interventions under agri-environment schemes (AES) may not significantly increase herpetofaunal diversity in the short term. Vegetation management is likely to increase the abundance of common lizard species rather than increase local species richness due to barrier effects. Future incentive schemes should focus on improving habitat connectivity, enhancing pasture condition and increasing woody debris in the agricultural matrix to dissolve dispersal barriers and mitigate the legacy of historical land-use practices. We propose that AES, which manage mosaics of intergrading vegetation types at multiple spatial scales, will protect maximum herpetofaunal diversity. These recommendations have implications for AES world-wide, many of which currently do not adequately address the habitat requirements of herpetofauna. © 2013 British Ecological Society.","10.1111/1365-2664.12215","CE","CE_10295",355,0.210486391475618,0.193139213317977,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Roads limit animal movements through behavioral avoidance and mortality during crossing attempts. We investigated the impact of a road network on the movement patterns of Blanding's Turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) in Québec, Canada. We tested the hypothesis that roads act as a barrier to movements. We monitored 52 Blanding's Turtles (22 females, 24 males, and 6 juveniles) via radiotelemetry during their active season from May to August 2010. Road avoidance was quantified for each individual by comparing the number of inferred road crossings with the number of expected road crossings predicted by 1,000 movement path randomizations. Overall, Blanding's Turtles significantly avoided crossing roads. Roads were a significant barrier to movement for 3-6 of the 52 turtles, and an individual's tendency to cross roads was not influenced by its sex or by the road surface (unpaved or paved). Preserving demographic and genetic connectivity of animal populations separated by roads is a major conservation challenge for species at risk such as the Blanding's Turtle.

Roads increase habitat fragmentation, but properly managed roadsides may be able to function as wildlife corridors. Here we use radiotelemetry to observe movement patterns of Gopher Tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) along potential roadside corridors at the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, USA, to determine if tortoises use roadsides as movement pathways between larger habitat patches or as residential habitat. Additionally, we translocated tortoises to study the feasibility of roadsides to function as movement corridors. We found that roadsides are not used as a movement pathway but rather as an apparent long-term residential habitat. Only one tortoise was observed exiting the roadside corridor, and minimum convex polygon (MCP) home range sizes and distances traveled remain similar to those exhibited by tortoises in larger habitat patches. Following translocation, we observed a failure to return home, either by direct paths or by corridor use, for all but one tortoise. Instead, most tortoises remained along roadsides after only a brief period of exploration. Overall, we find that roadsides act as independent, residential habitat instead of as a movement corridor. Future studies should focus on understanding the actual suitability of roadsides, as they may function as ecological traps given their attractiveness but high risk of mortality. While we urge caution, current management should treat roadsides as residential locations for Gopher Tortoises and focus on reducing road mortality.","10.1670/17-013","CE","CE_10301",248,0.285619615239971,0.127458653297341,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
10310,2013,"Demographic Evidence of Illegal Harvesting of an Endangered Asian Turtle","Conservation Biology","Harvesting pressure on Asian freshwater turtles is severe, and dramatic population declines of these turtles are being driven by unsustainable collection for food markets, pet trade, and traditional Chinese medicine. Populations of big-headed turtle (Platysternon megacephalum) have declined substantially across its distribution, particularly in China, because of overcollection. To understand the effects of chronic harvesting pressure on big-headed turtle populations, we examined the effects of illegal harvesting on the demography of populations in Hong Kong, where some populations still exist. We used mark-recapture methods to compare demographic characteristics between sites with harvesting histories and one site in a fully protected area. Sites with a history of illegal turtle harvesting were characterized by the absence of large adults and skewed ratios of juveniles to adults, which may have negative implications for the long-term viability of populations. These sites also had lower densities of adults and smaller adult body sizes than the protected site. Given that populations throughout most of the species' range are heavily harvested and individuals are increasingly difficult to find in mainland China, the illegal collection of turtles from populations in Hong Kong may increase over time. Long-term monitoring of populations is essential to track effects of illegal collection, and increased patrolling is needed to help control illegal harvesting of populations, particularly in national parks. Because few, if any, other completely protected populations remain in the region, our data on an unharvested population of big-headed turtles serve as an important reference for assessing the negative consequences of harvesting on populations of stream turtles. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.","10.1111/cobi.12102","CE","CE_10310",264,0.26687450628612,-0.0132904982531986,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10314,2013,"Post-emergence handling of green turtle hatchlings: Improving hatchery management worldwide","Animal Conservation","Hatcheries are commonly used to protect sea turtle eggs from poaching and predation; however, there is currently limited scientific evidence to support good hatchery management practices, particularly post-hatching. This study investigated the effects of retaining hatchlings in hatcheries after emergence and delaying nest excavations on the quality of green turtle Chelonia mydas hatchlings. In addition, the effect of artificial lighting on the sea-finding ability of green turtles was investigated to highlight the importance of hatchling release locations on hatchery beaches. Hatchling running speed, an indicator of vigour and predation exposure, progressively decreased when hatchlings were retained in the hatchery for 1, 3 and 6 hours following emergence. Similarly, body condition (mass:straight carapace length), an indicator of dehydration and/or energy consumption, decreased after being retained for 3 and 6 hours. It was estimated that hatchlings retained for 6 hours after emergence would become significantly dehydrated and double their exposure to beach slope predation. Residual hatchlings that were immediately excavated from emerged nests had similar running speed and body condition to naturally emerged siblings. However, residual hatchlings removed from nests 5 days later had significantly reduced running speed and body condition, resulting in estimates of double the exposure to predation in near-shore areas. The mean angle of hatchling dispersal varied at different sites along the Ma'Daerah beach in relation to proximity to artificial lighting. Important recommendations for post-hatching management of sea turtle hatcheries worldwide can be made from the results of this study. To maximize release of hatchlings in the best condition as is possible, hatchlings should be released immediately after emergence, including excavation of any residual hatchlings. In addition, the dispersal angles of hatchlings should be tested at each hatchery beach to determine suitable release sites for efficient dispersal. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00603.x","CE","CE_10314",292,0.15290087899747,0.172811576026302,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10316,2012,"Roadside connectivity does not increase reptile abundance or richness in a fragmented mallee landscape","Austral Ecology","The effect of isolation and the importance of dispersal in establishing and maintaining populations in fragments of remnant habitat remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, environmental connectivity is likely to be important for ensuring the long-term preservation of biodiversity in extensively cleared landscapes. In this study, we compared reptile communities in large conservation parks with those in small woodland remnants 6.5-12km from the parks, on the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia, Australia. We assessed the impact of fragmentation on the abundance, richness and habitat preferences of reptiles, and examined whether connection to linear roadside vegetation altered reptile communities in small woodland remnants. Of the 31 reptile species, 12 were restricted to conservation parks and six to habitat fragments in farmland. There was a substantial reduction in reptile species richness and abundance in farmland fragments. Direct connection of remnant vegetation to roadside corridors did not affect abundance of common species in the farmland fragments, although species richness was lower in isolated remnants in one of our two study regions. The habitat preference of the scincid lizard Menetia greyii differed between farmland fragments, where they were regularly found on dunes and roadsides, and conservation parks, where they were rare and not detected on dunes. We suggest that habitat fragmentation may have altered interspecific interactions, enabling an expansion of habitat use in the farming landscape. Significantly lower abundance of four common species in farmland settings compared with reserves indicated that existing corridors and small fragments provide inadequate connectivity over larger distances. To counter this effect, large reserves may need to be less than 10km apart. © 2011 The Authors.

All three species are harvested from wild populations. None of these species are protected by Indonesian law, but there is a national harvest and export quota system in place to prevent overexploitation. For each species, we collected data from catchers, middlemen and exporters on harvest volumes, catching locales, turn-over and prices, and compared these figures with the quota allocated by the Indonesian authorities. The trade in G. gecko from Central and East Java (3 traders, 2006) amounts to around 1.2 million individuals annually, greatly exceeding the national quota of 50,000 G. gecko for the entire year and representing a monetary value for exporters of around one million USD/year. The annual trade in A. javanicus (in five cities in East and South Kalimantan, and North Sumatra, Riau (central Sumatra) and South Sumatra, 2005-6) was estimated at around 300,000 individuals from Kalimantan and 30,000 from Sumatra, exceeding the national quota of 200,000 individuals/year and representing a monetary value for exporters of at least three million USD/year. The trade in A. cartilaginea was monitored in three cities in North Sumatra and Riau in 1999: 200-450,000 individuals were traded in 1998 and 1999, greatly exceeding the national quota of 10,000, with a monetary value for exporters in excess of ten million USD/year. We conclude that implementation of wildlife trade regulations by and large are not abided by many reptile traders and are not sufficiently enforced by the Indonesian authorities.

Many North American estuaries are adversely affected by anthropogenic impacts, such as pollution, dredging and invasion by non-native plants. Many nesting areas have been altered or destroyed, causing terrapins to nest on roadsides and artificial islands made of dredged substrate from bottom sediments. Shading by non-native plants may suppress development and reduce survival of embryos. In Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, USA, there is a mosaic of natural and degraded terrapin nesting habitats. We investigated the effects of dredge soil and shade on the hatching success of diamondback terrapins to determine whether nesting habitat could be increased by using dredged bottom sediments. In year 1, unshaded nests in natural loamy-sand had the highest hatching success (55.2%), while nests in dredge soil produced no hatchlings. In year 2, nests in unshaded loamy-sand had a hatching success of 85.3%, whereas those in dredge soil, aged 1 year, had a hatching success of 59.4%. Dredge soil improved as an incubation substrate after aging 1 year by the washout of salt. Nest temperatures were generally cool and produced mostly male hatchlings. Uncontaminated dredge soil may provide suitable nesting substrates for diamondback terrapins if used after one year, and may be particularly beneficial if used for constructing islands that provide new nesting sites with reduced access of mammalian predators. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","10.1111/1749-4877.12042","CE","CE_10389",233,0.266535233179401,0.169295531999068,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

To understand the relationship between physiological stress and translocation, we conducted a multiyear study (2007-2009) using a population of desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) near Fort Irwin, California. Blood samples were collected from adult tortoises in three treatment groups (resident, translocated and control) for 1 year prior to and 2 years after translocation. Samples were analyzed by radioimmunoassay for plasma total corticosterone (CORT), a glucocorticoid hormone commonly associated with stress responses in reptiles. CORT values were analyzed in relation to potential covariates (animal sex, date, behavior, treatment, handling time, air temperature, home-range size, precipitation and annual plant production) among seasons and years. CORT values in males were higher than in females, and values for both varied monthly throughout the activity season and among years. Year and sex were strong predictors of CORT, and translocation explained little in terms of CORT. Based on these results, we conclude that translocation does not elicit a physiological stress response in desert tortoises. Animal Conservation © 2012 The Authors.

Comparing behavioral traits of translocated individuals with those of sympatric or nearby resident individuals can provide an ecologically relevant baseline to determine if translocated individuals show behavioral traits consistent with those of long-term residents. We used radio telemetry to concurrently monitor 21 translocated and 15 resident gopher tortoises across 2 sites in southern Georgia and compared movement patterns, body weights, and multi-scale habitat selection between treatments. Translocated tortoises moved farther and had larger home ranges than resident tortoises but showed similar patterns of site fidelity. We observed no differences in body weight change between treatments. Patterns of habitat selection were similar between treatments in that tortoises selected structurally open habitats at all scales. Our study suggests that more extensive post-release movements compared to resident individuals may not necessarily lead to lower site fidelity in translocated individuals. We suspect that the presence of structurally suitable habitat within the release area and retaining translocated individuals within a pre-release enclosure for 10 months contributed to high site fidelity. Although comparing translocated and resident individuals can help inform translocation efforts, we caution that using resident individuals from ecological sinks may lead to misleading results.","10.1002/jwmg.790","CE","CE_10414",219,0.171069910373531,0.166825162886243,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
10419,2013,"Is there really no place like home? Movement, site fidelity, and survival probability of translocated and resident turtles","Biodiversity and Conservation","Wildlife translocations, the deliberate movement of wild individuals from one part of their distribution to another, are increasingly being used as a conservation tool. Despite the popularity of translocations as a conservation technique, translocations are often not successful as a result of excessive movement, poor release site fidelity, and low survival. This study compares the movement patterns, site fidelity, and survival probability of resident and hard-released musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus) in a complex of patchy distributed wetlands. Our results are different from most translocation studies as the majority of translocated turtles had movement (minimum convex polygon area, total distance moved, number of wetlands used, and the number of movement shifts between wetlands), release site fidelity, and wetland fidelity patterns that were similar to resident turtles. In addition, the survival probabilities of resident and translocated turtles were both high. We believe the combination of poor overland movement capabilities and the patchy distribution of wetlands surrounded by a strong boundary matrix of terrestrial habitat, potentially increased the costs of leaving the wetland. The high costs of travelling overland to more distant wetlands may have constrained the translocated turtles dispersal from the release site and increased release site fidelity. Our study suggests that hard-release translocations may be an effective conservation method for highly aquatic species unlikely to leave the wetland and travel long overland distances. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","10.1007/s10531-013-0578-1","CE","CE_10419",229,0.134044765151175,0.171368620169803,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Our results suggest that forced aestivation soft-releases may succeed in reducing dispersal by forcing spur-thighed tortoises to spend time at the release site as the majority of translocated tortoises had similar activity range sizes and movement path tortuosity as resident tortoises. Spur-thighed tortoise conservation will require protecting habitat at multiple scales, with the remaining native forests in the country of Jordan being important to the spur-thighed tortoise during the activity and aestivation/hibernation seasons, as this macrohabitat was used significantly more than the human-modified habitats.

To date, there has been limited retrospective evaluation on the impact of recovery plans, despite an increasing interest in evaluating recovery planning motivated by demands for greater accountability and a shift away from single-species focused strategies to multi-species, landscape and ecosystem-based plans. In the context of threatened species management in Australia, we aimed to investigate whether listed species with recovery plans are more likely to have improved their status compared to listed species without recovery plans. Since 1999, over 600 draft and approved recovery plans have been developed for more than 850 of 1663 species currently listed threatened species in Australia. We applied a novel econometric matching analysis to reduce biases associated with the non-random selection of species for listing and recovery planning. We found that the presence or absence of a recovery plan did not have a statistically significant effect on whether a species' status was improving, stable or declining. The result suggests that recovery plans may not be useful in the short term and uncertainty persists about whether or not they make a long term contribution to species recovery. One major contributing factor is the lack of basic accounting of recovery planning efforts. This limits our ability to refute or confirm the impact of recovery planning on species status, and has the potential to reduce public confidence in government expenditures. Better systems for reporting and evaluation are therefore required to promote transparency, improve existing knowledge and facilitate efficient investments in future management actions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2011.02.008","CE","CE_10423",264,0.31128692836468,0.158421993866241,"300","neutral","neutral_300",1

Their behaviour in the wild after release was compared with that of 12 healthy control turtles captured in the same region and fitted with similar satellite tags. The behaviour of the rehabilitated turtles was more variable than that of the control turtles and an outlier analysis revealed that only two of the six rehabilitated turtles did not differ in their behaviour from that of the control turtles. For the other turtles, the following anomalies were detected: a higher speed of travel, a negative cosine of the turning angle (the turtle turns back very often), a higher percentage of shelf use, a longer time at the surface at night, a higher averaged latitude during tracking, a shorter total tracking time and lower percentage of good quality fixes. Nevertheless, none of the turtles exhibited simultaneously these anomalies and only one turtle exhibited more than two anomalies. These results suggest that most rehabilitated loggerhead sea turtles survive in the wild at least for several months after release, even after a long and complicated process of veterinarian treatment, but many may exhibit behavioural anomalies, which casts doubts on the success of readaptation in the long run. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","10.1002/aqc.1242","CE","CE_10427",218,0.0632488538029934,0.0681571425954438,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
10428,2017,"Herbaceous cover enhances the squamate reptile community in woody crops","Journal for Nature Conservation","The intensification of agriculture entails the simplification and homogenisation of the landscape, which has serious negative impacts on animal biodiversity. Herbaceous ground cover in olive groves creates heterogeneous patchworks that differ as regards how intensively farmed olive groves are structured and composed, which may lead to a decrease in this loss of biodiversity. Reptiles rapidly respond to changes in vegetation and other habitat disturbances, in spite of which, this taxa has received very little attention with regard to their vulnerability to agriculture systems. In this study, we investigated the response of a squamate reptile assemblage to different management systems in olive groves. Reptile communities were recorded in areas with three types of olive grove management systems: bare ground, natural cover crop, and monospecific cover crop. We further compared habitat structure and vegetation richness in the study area in order to verify if management systems have an impact on the frequency of occurrence and diversity of squamate reptiles species within olive groves. The community composition of reptiles differed among the three management systems, although this was modulated by the age of the olive trees. Our results show that the squamate reptile communities were more restricted in areas of intense management (bare ground) than in those with cover crops. When herbaceous covers existed, natural ground cover harboured a more diverse community. Our data suggest that while monospecific cover crops improve the frequency of occurrence of reptiles, species richness does not increase; however, more heterogeneous herbaceous ground cover (which, for instance, contain more species and are more similar to natural vegetation) would be a better solution regarding the promotion of diversity in reptile assemblages in agricultural landscapes. Finally our results may be used to improve the habitat quality of squamate reptile communities in similar woody crops like vineyards or orchards, where cover crops are beginning to be implemented.","10.1016/j.jnc.2017.02.009","CE","CE_10428",305,0.280217865433501,0.19519757914238,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Simply documenting usage of the newly created habitats by biota is not enough, because such areas may serve as sink populations. We need to monitor viability (growth, survival, reproduction) of individuals that colonize the newly created habitat, compared with conspecifics in non-restored areas. In the Sydney region in south-eastern Australia, humans have degraded sandstone rock outcrops by removing natural rocks for landscaping urban gardens. We restored degraded rock outcrops by placing artificial rocks at sites where natural rocks had been removed. We measured growth rates and survival in velvet geckos Oedura lesueurii at control and restored sites over a 2-year period. Gecko growth rates were unaffected by habitat restoration, but restoring sites with artificial rocks increased the overall numbers of lizards detected (both adults and juveniles). The apparent survival rates of adult male lizards (as estimated using mark) were not significantly affected by habitat restoration. However, apparent survival rates of juvenile geckos were higher at restored sites than at unrestored sites. Synthesis and applications. Habitat restoration using artificial rocks has had measurable conservation benefits on these degraded rocky outcrops. Quantifying those benefits in terms of species' survival and growth rates enables management decisions about habitat restoration to be based upon evidence rather than wishful thinking or untested intuition.

However, the methods used are often applied haphazardly and are rarely evaluated, especially in tropical Asia. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of long-distance translocation on the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) in South China, where they are routinely removed from urban areas or homes and translocated into national parks. Using radio telemetry, we compared the ecology and biology of resident and translocated snakes to determine if long-distance translocation (> 3 km) is a viable conservation option. Translocation extended the period over which predation occurred and significantly decreased survival. Translocated snakes made unidirectional movements away from points of release, yet these movements were not oriented towards points of origin and there was no evidence for homing behavior. Translocation significantly increased frequency of movements and distances moved by female snakes, but no such differences were observed for male snakes. In contrast with resident snakes, translocated snakes did not show synchrony in the onset of brumation, and translocation appeared to negatively affect reproduction in both males and females. Our results suggest that long-distance translocation is not the best management approach to handle nuisance individuals of this species. Findings of this study can be used to prescribe improvements for current strategies to deal with nuisance snakes in Hong Kong and in the region.","10.1016/j.biocon.2016.10.013","CE","CE_10431",238,0.219546104053487,0.0720720877952385,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

On Florida's Keewaydin Island predation by raccoons Procyon lotor and invasive feral swine Sus scrofa are disparate, significant threats to marine turtle nests. Using 6 years of nesting data (mostly for loggerhead marine turtles Caretta caretta) we examined the impacts of swine predation on nests and the benefits of swine eradication, caging nests to protect them from raccoon predation, and the effects of nest caging on swine predation. Nest predation by swine began in mid nesting season 2007, after which swine quickly annihilated all remaining marine turtle nests. During 2005-2010 raccoon predation rates for caged nests (0.7-20.4%) were significantly lower than for uncaged nests (5.6-68.8%) in every year except 2009, when little raccoon predation occurred. The proportions of eggs lost from raccoon-predated nests did not differ between caged and uncaged nests. Caging did not prevent destruction by swine but median survival time for caged nests was 11.5 days longer than for uncaged nests, indicating that caged eggs in nests have a greater chance of hatching before being predated by swine. The financial cost of the eradication of swine greatly outweighed the value of hatchlings lost to swine predation in 2007.","10.1017/S0030605314000805","CE","CE_10434",202,0.309464608140956,-0.237378461588201,"250","negative","negative_250",0

The community-based turtle conservation programme that we developed on Vamizi Island has facilitated the identification and protection of a key nesting site for the green marine turtle Chelonia mydas in Mozambique, with a mean of 122 nests per year. The area is also used by nesting female and immature hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata. Nesting activity of green turtles was observed all year round, with a peak in the summer (February-March). Incubation periods of this species showed seasonal fluctuations inversely correlated with air temperature. Hatching success was high (87%) when nests were not lost through tidal overwash and erosion, which affected nearly 40% of all nests in 2007. Using satellite tracking of four green turtles nesting on Vamizi we identified foraging grounds in marine protected areas in Kenya, Tanzania and north-west Madagascar. Migratory routes of two individuals along the East African coast were generally neritic and all passed through the waters of multiple nations and as many as six marine conservation areas, emphasizing the importance of regional cooperation.

Roadkill has been documented widely and affects all taxonomic groups. Although roadkill is associated mainly with traffic density, some life-history traits of species and the area surrounding roads are expected to modify number of roadkills both taxonomically and geographically. Here we studied the number of roadkills of vertebrates in an extensive region in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula. We surveyed 820 km of 41 roads in two different seasons (spring and autumn), that differ in traffic intensity. In addition, we covered zones with distinct climatic characteristics and levels of protection of the surrounding habitats. Amphibians showed the highest number of roadkills whereas reptiles, birds and mammals had similar rates. General Linear Model tests showed no differences in roadkills by climatic region; however, differences in number of roadkills were linked to protection status, with the highest number of casualties in highly protected areas. Redundancy Analysis demonstrated that the number of amphibians and reptiles killed was associated with roads in highly protected areas whereas that of mammals and birds was linked to unprotected areas. Protected areas often receive many visitors, which in turn may increase wildlife casualties as a result of greater traffic density. We recommend that correction measures be taken to reduce the high number of vertebrate fauna killed along roads that cross protected areas. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10531-012-0332-0","CE","CE_10438",233,0.1676866306198,0.122961819655196,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Why some translocations succeed and others fail is not well understood, but may be related to phenotypic changes brought about by captivity. We found that variation in speed and body condition index among a small group of captive-reared Otago skinks (Oligosoma otagense) did not influence their survival after release to the wild. In the first 12 months, 75% of skinks persisted, and this reduced to 58% by 18 months. After combining our results with data for other Oligosoma species, we found that captive-reared skinks pre-release have a higher body condition index and are about 50% slower than wild lizards; however, slower speeds are not consistently associated with higher body condition indices.

Despite the availability of by-catch reduction devices (BRDs) for crab pots, adoption of BRDs has not been mandated and by-catch of terrapins continues. We conducted experimental fishing studies in North Carolina's year-round blue crab fishery from 2000 to 2004 to evaluate the ability of various BRDs to reduce terrapin by-catch without a concomitant reduction in the catch of blue crabs. In 4,822 crab pot days fished, we recorded only 21 terrapin captures. Estimated capture rates were 0.003 terrapins/pot per day in hard crab experimental fishing and 0.008 terrapins/pot per day in peeler experimental fishing. All terrapin captures occurred from April to mid-May within 321.4 m of the shoreline. Longer soak times produced more dead terrapins, with 4 live and 4 dead during hard crab experimental fishing and 11 live and 2 dead during peeler experimental fishing. The 4.0-cm BRDs in fall and 4.5-cm and 5.0-cm BRDs in spring reduced the catch of legal-sized male hard crabs by 26.6%, 21.2%, and 5.7%, respectively. Only the 5.0-cm BRDs did not significantly affect the catch of legal-sized hard male crabs. However, BRDs had no measurable effect on catch of target crabs in the peeler crab fishery. Our results identify 3 complementary and economically feasible tools for blue crab fishery managers to exclude terrapins from commercially fished crab pots in North Carolina: 1) gear modifications (e.g., BRDs); 2) distance-to-shore restrictions; and 3) time-of-year regulations.

For the repatriation experiment, 27 snakes were captive-born, raised for four years, and released into a nature reserve previously known to host massasaugas. Other than being relatively sedentary, snakes behaved normally upon release in that they engaged in reproductive behavior. Survival (70%) was relatively high until hibernation (19 weeks). However, none of the snakes that did hibernate (n = 19) survived into the following active season.

However, in some species, homing and movement behaviors may undermine the success of translocation efforts. For the federally protected Agassiz's desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), translocation is a strategy used to manage declining populations, yet homing behavior in this species is poorly understood. To explore homing behavior and movement patterns after translocation, we radio tracked 80 tortoises during a 2-phase experimental translocation. Phase 1 included 40 tortoises that were translocated, then monitored for a period of 37 days (21 Sep-28 Oct 2009), and phase 2 included a different group of 40 tortoises that were translocated and then monitored for 186 days (13 Apr-20 Oct 2010). In both phases, we assigned tortoises randomly to 1 of 3 treatment groups: translocated (displaced 2, 5, or 8 km from their source location), handling control, or control. After translocation, 20% of the translocated tortoises were able to navigate to their source location, and translocation distance had an effect on their ability to navigate home. We found 44% of tortoises in the 2-km translocated group returned home; 1 tortoise in the 5-km group, and no tortoises in the 8-km translocated group returned. The time required to reach home ranged from 5 to 37 days for the 2-km group, and 34 days for the 5-km group. We deemed tortoises to have homed successfully if they returned to their source location within 37 days of translocation as this reflected the duration of phase 1 and allowed for a balanced comparison between the 2 phases. We found that translocated tortoises moved at least 1.5 times more overall than the control groups, with some individuals moving >10 km from the translocation site. These patterns persisted even after accounting for seasonal and sex differences in distance traveled. By identifying homing behaviors and quantifying post-translocation movement patterns, this experiment addressed a key data gap in tortoise behavior that may limit the efficacy of tortoise translocation efforts. Our results point to the need to account for behavioral responses of tortoises to minimize risk to translocated individuals and maximize the success of translocation projects.","10.1002/jwmg.823","CE","CE_10444",329,0.135648034611398,0.0710555684552676,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Nest protection techniques vary but wire box cages and plastic mesh screens are two common tools used to deter predation by a host of beach-foraging, opportunistic mammalian predators. We empirically tested the efficacy of wire cages and plastic mesh screens in preventing red fox Vulpes vulpes predation on artificial nests. Both techniques averted fox predation (0%), whereas unprotected control nests suffered 33% predation under conditions of normal predator motivation, or a level of motivation stimulated by loggerhead turtle egg scent. However, in side-by-side comparisons under conditions of presumed high predator motivation, 25% of mesh screens were breached whereas no cage-protected nests were successfully predated. In addition to effectiveness at preventing predation, factors such as cost, ease of use, deployment time, and magnetic disturbance were evaluated.

Inland commercial fisheries that use passive gears such as fyke nets cause the drowning of some freshwater turtles. To reduce fisheries impacts on turtles, bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) successfully implemented in marine systems may be adapted to freshwater systems. We tested the efficacy of two BRDs designed to exclude turtles from fyke nets by comparing catch rates and composition to unmodified nets. We also tested the efficacy of a BRD designed to let turtles escape the net by comparing turtle and fish escape capacities to a large hole in the net. The exclusion device with bars across the net opening significantly reduced turtle catch rates, and both exclusion devices did not affect fish catch rates. With the escape device, all turtles escaped (using painted turtles, Chrysemys picta, as an experimental model) and most (88%) fish were retained while a large hole allowed 60% and 77% of turtles and fish to escape, respectively. The escape device was the most effective for avoiding turtle bycatch mortality while retaining fish.

A major campaign to eradicate nonnative goats and burros was initiated in 1995 on Alcedo Volcano in the Galápagos Archipelago that ultimately removed 62,868 goats and eliminated them by 2006. Planners of the eradication program had the foresight to invest in intensive monitoring of the status of the volcano's giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra) population whose welfare was a primary motivation for the eradication effort. Monitoring revealed an increase in the proportion of juveniles among all tortoises as well as increased growth rates of individual tortoises on Alcedo Volcano from earlier to later phases of the eradication campaign. Over the same time frame in a control population on nearby Santa Cruz Island (where goats and donkeys were not removed) juvenile fraction and individual growth rates remained unchanged. Although goat removal coincided with occurrence of a rare climatic event that simultaneously boosted forage availability for tortoises, failure to observe a comparable improvement in the control population implies that removal of goats and burros was the primary causative factor of improving population status of tortoises on Alcedo Volcano. © 2012 Society for Ecological Restoration.","10.1111/j.1526-100X.2012.00891.x","CE","CE_10451",209,0.0961193985482475,0.102862416182142,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Despite often being designed for larger mammals, crossing structures appear to enable safe crossings for a range of smaller, ground dwelling species that exhibit high vulnerability to roads. Less attention has been paid to the extent to which fauna overpasses function as habitat in their own right, an issue particularly relevant to reptiles and amphibians. The Compton Road fauna array (Brisbane, Australia) includes a vegetated fauna overpass which connects two urban forest reserves and traverses a major four lane arterial road. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which colonisation of the Compton Road fauna overpass by reptile and amphibian species living in adjacent forests occurred. Pitfall sampling at seven sampling sites occurred between June 2005 and February 2010, starting approximately six months after overpass construction, with additional observational detections throughout this period. The overpass yielded higher species diversity and capture rates compared with the forest areas. Species accumulation curves demonstrated a strong and consistent colonisation rate of the overpass throughout the six year monitoring period, while persistent occupation by species on the overpass throughout the six years suggests permanent colonisation of the vegetated structure as an extension of the natural forest habitat. These outcomes demonstrate that the fauna overpass at Compton Road provides suitable habitat for diverse local herpetofauna communities and suggest enhanced habitat connectivity across the road.","10.1016/j.gecco.2015.07.002","CE","CE_10452",252,0.225876764002553,0.14091915297587,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

In this study, we examined the effectiveness of illuminating nets with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) placed on floatlines in order to reduce sea turtle bycatch in a smallscale bottom-set gillnet fishery. In Sechura Bay, northern Peru, 114 pairs of control and illuminated nets were deployed. The predicted mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) of target species, standardized for environmental variables using generalized additive model (GAM) analysis, was similar for both control and illuminated nets. In contrast, the predicted mean CPUE of green turtles Chelonia mydas was reduced by 63.9% in illuminated nets. A total of 125 green turtles were caught in control nets, while 62 were caught in illuminated nets. This statistically significant re duction (GAM analysis, p < 0.05) in sea turtle bycatch suggests that net illumination could be an effective conservation tool. Challenges to implementing the use of LEDs include equipment costs, increased net handling times, and limited awareness among fishermen regarding the effectiveness of this technology. Cost estimates for preventing a single sea turtle catch are as low as 34 USD, while the costs to outfit the entire gillnet fishery in Sechura Bay can be as low as 9200 USD. Understanding these cost challenges emphasizes the need for institutional support from national ministries, inter-national non-governmental organizations and the broader fisheries industry to make possible widespread implementation of net illumination as a sea turtle bycatch reduction strategy.","10.3354/meps11610","CE","CE_10459",242,0.158420124515469,0.136901864901872,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Installing artificial nesting mounds may increase recruitment and decrease the risk of mortality for gravid females by enticing them to nest closer to aquatic habitats. We evaluated the effectiveness of artificial nesting mounds installed in Algonquin Park, Canada. Artificial mounds were monitored for 2 years to determine if turtles would select them for nest sites. We also simulated turtle paths from wetlands to nests to determine the probability that females would encounter the new habitat. A transplant experiment with clutches of Chrysemys picta and Chelydra serpentina eggs compared nest success and incubation conditions in the absence of predation between artificial mounds and natural sites. More turtles than expected used the artificial mounds, although mounds comprised a small proportion of the available nesting habitat and the simulations predicted that the probability of females encountering mounds was low. Hatching success was higher in nests transplanted to artificial mounds (93%) than in natural nests (56%), despite no differences in heat units.

10464,2013,"Reducing the impact of a toxic invader by inducing taste aversion in an imperilled native reptile predator","Animal Conservation","It is virtually impossible to eradicate invasive organisms once they have spread widely, and even low densities of invaders may have devastating impacts. We need to explore alternative management options that accept the inevitability of encounters between alien and native taxa, but reduce the negative consequences of those encounters. Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is one approach that offers promise in this respect. The spread of the invasive cane toad Rhinella marina across northern Australia is devastating populations of predators such as the blue-tongued skink Tiliqua scincoides intermedia. Predators unable to tolerate the toads' powerful bufadienolide chemical defences are likely to die if they ingest a toad. We trained field-caught skinks to avoid eating cane toad flesh, by offering them toad sausages laced with a nausea-inducing chemical (lithium chloride). These individuals (and controls) were then released and radio-tracked as toads arrived at our study site in north-western Australia. Skinks that regurgitated after consuming the toad sausage survived after release, whereas most untrained animals were fatally poisoned by toad ingestion. Even if we cannot eradicate invasive cane toads, we can ameliorate their ecological impact by CTA training of vulnerable predators. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/acv.12004","CE","CE_10464",198,0.575406628509443,-0.316780661135596,"200","negative","negative_200",1

However, there have been no studies that have tested whether 'turtle-friendly' lights are benign to hatchling sea turtle sea-finding ability. Aims We tested two different types of 'turtle-friendly' lights (LED amber-light peak intensity 620nm and LED red-light peak intensity 640nm) to see whether they are disruptive to the sea-finding ability of eastern-coast Australian loggerhead turtle hatchlings. Methods Using standard circular-arena experiments, we assessed the directional preference of newly emerged loggerhead turtle hatchlings from the Woongarra Coast of Queensland, Australia, during different moon phases without artificial lighting and in the presence of 'turtle-friendly' lights. Key results Contrary to expectations, sea-finding ability of hatchlings was disrupted by the amber lights, particularly in the absence of a moon. The less intense red lights were less disruptive to hatchlings; however, misorientation and disorientation events still occurred when lights were within 4m of hatchlings. The disruptive impact on sea-finding ability increased with the cumulative impact of multiple lights increasing light intensity. Conclusions The 'turtle-friendly' lights we used disrupted the sea-finding ability of eastern-coast Australian loggerhead turtle hatchlings, with the most pronounced disruption occurring under moonless conditions. Implications The use of amber and red LED lights adjacent to the nesting beaches of loggerhead sea turtles should be managed because this lighting has the potential to disrupt the sea-finding ability of sea turtle hatchlings.","10.1071/WR15138","CE","CE_10468",271,0.172833600038901,-0.0149818057674127,"300","neutral","neutral_300",1

Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project","Restoration Ecology","Aquatic turtles worldwide are plagued with habitat loss due to development and shoreline alteration that destroys the terrestrial-aquatic linkage which they must cross to reproduce successfully. Furthermore, nesting habitat loss can concentrate nesting, increasing nest predator efficiency. We describe how the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island created nesting habitat for Malaclemys terrapin (Diamondback Terrapin), and document nesting success in response to construction progress and the absence of raccoons and foxes, the primary nest predators. We monitored terrapin nests throughout the nesting seasons from 2002 to 2011 to determine overall and within-nest survivorship. Female terrapins began nesting on the restoration project within 1 year but planned construction during the study eliminated some nesting areas and opened previously inaccessible areas. Overall, nest survivorship was considerably higher than mainland nesting areas due to the absence of raccoons and foxes on the island and within-nest survivorship was similar. Egg size, hatchling size, and the frequency of shell scute anomalies were similar to other terrapin populations, suggesting normal developmental conditions on the island. We documented annual variation in hatchling size that correlated negatively with mean air temperature during the incubation season. Our results indicate that restored or created isolated island habitat can be located rapidly by terrapins and can become an important source of recruitment in regions where nesting habitat is limited and predation is high. Poplar Island illustrates how habitat loss and restoration can affect turtle populations by revealing the changes in nesting patterns and success in newly created, predator-free habitat.","10.1111/rec.12147","CE","CE_10469",252,0.166649319456847,0.11571136482693,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10470,2014,"Evaluation of headstarting and release techniques for population augmentation and reintroduction of the smooth green snake","Animal Conservation","Headstarting is a conservation technique for improving survival of species with high juvenile mortality by accelerating growth rate and increasing body size of captive-born young. With reptiles, headstarts are often kept active year-round to achieve body size goals and increase survival, omitting overwintering (brumation). As brumation is part of the life cycle of reptiles, there may be tradeoffs related to temperature response post-release when reptiles are kept active. Upon release into habitats, reptiles are either soft released, where acclimation is provided with in situ enclosures, or hard released without acclimation, directly into habitat. Soft releases have resulted in greater survival and site fidelity than hard releases, but evaluations with snakes are rare. We used a comparative approach to examine effects of brumation versus year-round activity on prerelease growth and survival of smooth green snake Opheodrys vernalis headstarts. We estimated short-term post-release daily survival rates of headstarts and compared movements of hard and soft released snakes. Despite decreases in body mass during brumation, prerelease body size, growth rate and survival did not differ among brumation treatments. Brumated headstarts exhibited rapid compensatory growth, attaining the size of active headstarts within 2 months of brumation. We observed qualitative evidence of reproductive potential in brumated snakes with the production of spermatozoa and unfertilized eggs, which was absent in active headstarts. The short-term survival rate of all headstarts during post-release tracking was 0.83 (±0.01), but we lacked power to examine differences in survival among release treatments. Daily movements did not differ among release treatments. Soft releases had slightly greater recaptures, facilitating monitoring. Although brumation comparisons produced equivalent prerelease growth and survival, as a precautionary measure for post-release survival, we recommend incorporating brumation into headstarting efforts. While further study with other reptiles is warranted, we recommend a comparative framework in planning headstarting efforts with additional species.","10.1111/acv.12151","CE","CE_10470",306,0.189074403756848,0.241717349180307,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Therefore, we documented gopher tortoise nest success and hatchling survival relative to mammalian predator control. We used 4, large (approx. 40-ha) fenced, predator exclosures to exclude mid-sized mammalian predators: bobcat (Lynx rufus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginianus), fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus and Vulpes vulpes), coyote (Canis latrans), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and skunk (Mephitis mephitis); 4 unfenced plots served as controls. We monitored nests for survival through hatching and used radio-telemetry to examine hatchling survival. We radio-tracked 40 hatchlings for up to 329 days, but we were only able to track 8 individuals from a single nest at an unfenced plot because of high nest predation. Mean nest survival was greater at exclosures than at unfenced controls (F1, 2 = 45.80, P = 0.0001). Hatchling survival differed ( 2 = 5.839, P = 0.016) between unfenced plots (37.5%) and exclosures (74.4%), suggesting that mammals also were significant predators of hatchlings. The number of juvenile (<13 cm in diameter) and subadult tortoise burrows (13-21.9 cm) increased over a 6-year period in exclosures, providing further support for an effect of excluding mammalian predators on nest and juvenile tortoise survival. © The Wildlife Society, 2012.","10.1002/jwmg.449","CE","CE_10473",204,0.218385446935298,0.0892242699772156,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Most turtles were small, surface-pelagic juveniles that were collected from oiled habitat distant from shore. Serial hematology, plasma biochemistry, and blood gas analyses were reviewed to characterize abnormalities relative to observed degree of oiling. Clinicopathological abnormalities upon admission indicated acute, nonspecific metabolic and osmoregulatory derangements that were attributable to a combination of events including stress, exertion, physical exhaustion, and dehydration related to oiling, capture, and transport. Specific toxicological effects reported in other taxa were not observed. Initial point-of-care blood data from one rescue center were evaluated using clinical assessment of physiological status for all turtles of all species with available data for pH, pCO2, sodium, and potassium. In addition, a prognostic model that was specifically developed for cold-stunned Kemp's ridley sea turtles Lepidochelys kempii was applied to oiled Kemp's ridley turtles from one center. Thirty-six percent of oiled turtles were identified as physio - logically de ranged based on a clinical assessment of their physiological status, and 25% of oiled Kemp's ridley sea turtles exceeded the mortality risk threshold of the prognostic model. These results indicate that the physiological derangements in these animals were relatively severe and clinically relevant. Based on observations during the DWH spill, adverse physiological effects in sea turtles may be an important consequence of stress, exertion, physical exhaustion, and de - hydration secondary to oiling, capture, and transport.","10.3354/esr00769","CE","CE_10474",249,0.314601899894151,0.0957445637399345,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

To evaluate how the species responded to forest restoration, we conducted a mark-recapture study in formerly fire-suppressed Longleaf pine forests exposed to prescribed fire or fire surrogates (i.e. mechanical or herbicide-facilitated hardwood removal) as well as in fire-suppressed control sites and reference sites, which represented the historic condition. After initial treatment, all sites were exposed to over a decade of prescribed burning with an average return interval of approximately 2 years. We used population-level response of A. sexlineata as an indicator of the effectiveness of the different treatments in restoring habitat. Specifically, we compared mean numbers of marked adults and juveniles at treatment sites to that of reference sites. After 4 years, restoration objectives were met at sites treated with burning alone and at sites treated with mechanical removal of hardwoods followed by fire. After over 10 years of prescribed burning, restoration objectives were met at all treatments.

Bankhead National Forest located in northwestern Alabama. We captured 2643 individuals representing 47 species (20 amphibians and 27 reptiles) during 3132 trap nights. Pre-treatment captures varied widely for both amphibians and reptiles among the stands designated for management, which was likely due to forest structural changes caused by tree mortality resulting from Southern Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis) infestations. Within each amphibian and reptile species assemblage, we observed species-specific associations with specific treatments and environmental characteristics. In regards to individual species responses, Eastern Fence Lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) increased in thin-with-burn treatments and Green Anoles (Anolis carolinensis) tended to increase in all thinned stands. North American Racers (Coluber constrictor) increased in thin-only plots primarily during the second post-treatment year. Mississippi Slimy Salamander (Plethodon mississippi) captures tended to decrease in all treatment stands throughout the study period, which may been due to either drier environmental conditions during post-treatment sampling or natural population cycling. Pool-breeding amphibian captures were more likely related to the hydroperiod of aquatic breeding environments within 290. m of survey locations rather than forest treatments. Our results illustrate that forest restoration through tree thinning can positively influence certain reptile species with limited impacts on amphibians in upland, pine-dominated forests of northern Alabama.

Our results show that both plant and reptile species richness as well as plant cover and reptile abundance was significantly higher in the protected KTP than in the non-protected farmland. The higher proportion of shrub but lower proportions of perennial grass cover, herb cover, and herb species richness in the farmland can be explained by higher stocking rates and the differences in feeding behaviour between native wild ungulates (e.g. Antidorcas marsupialis, Oryx gazella) and livestock (mainly sheep). The reptile's prey availability and microhabitats (perennial grass tussocks and rodent burrows) for thermoregulation and protection against predators were significantly lower in the farmland. To conclude, our results clearly show that long term effects of different land use options (wildlife in protected KTP versus extensive livestock production in the non-protected farmland) even within the same habitat type have led to significant changes in vegetation composition, availability of microhabitat structures and in the reptile community. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.jaridenv.2011.04.011","CE","CE_10478",205,0.420744474272493,0.43722801344211,"250","positive","positive_250",0
10481,2014,"Penning prior to release decreases postâtranslocation dispersal of jewelled geckos","Animal Conservation","Translocation is an essential conservation tool often used to re-establish reptile populations following anthropogenic extirpation, but is not always successful. One factor potentially limiting success is dispersal of individuals from the release site immediately after translocation and consequent non-overlap of ranges. 'Penning' involves the use of an enclosure to restrict dispersal of translocated animals for a pre-determined period of time, with the aim of habituating animals to the release site so that they will establish a breeding population. We evaluated the utility of penning for limiting post-translocation dispersal of jewelled geckos (Naultinus gemmeus) by simultaneously tracking 19 geckos that had either been translocated into a pen for 9-10 months prior to the pen's removal (n=10) or were translocated to a nearby site with no physical barrier to dispersal (n=9) over a 3-week period. The area occupied by penned geckos did not increase following removal of their pen, despite suitable habitat being available outside the pen area. In contrast, un-penned geckos moved distances of up to 40m outside of their release area, and effectively increased the area that they were occupying as a group 4.4-fold over the 3-week period. We suspect that when Naultinus geckos are released without time in a pen, some individuals may disperse too far to contribute to a breeding population and, consequently, the likelihood of population establishment and rate of population growth may be diminished. Our hypothesis is supported by a survey we conducted the following summer in which all four adult female geckos found at the penned site were gravid, but neither of the females resighted at the un-penned site was gravid. We believe that the potential advantages of penning (e.g. restricting initial dispersal, increased ease of monitoring) may outweigh the disadvantages (e.g. cost) for many herpetofauna translocations.","10.1111/acv.12149","CE","CE_10481",298,0.140693251918569,0.112344360396504,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
10482,2014,"Increasing the chance of successful translocation of a threatened lizard","Animal Conservation","Many reptile translocations fail, and they fail largely because the translocated individuals are faced with low habitat quality at the recipient site and/or disperse away from it. At least some failures may be forestalled by developing clear goals and success criteria, having a better understanding of the species' biology and the threats it faces, ensuring the quality of the site to which individuals are being moved and following through with long-term monitoring. We incorporated these considerations into a translocation that moved more than 500 individuals of the threatened Florida sand skink Plestiodon reynoldsiStejneger from a site slated for mining to an apparently suitable, but unoccupied site. Translocated individuals were placed into enclosures at the recipient site at densities similar to those at the donor site. Environmental conditions were varied within the enclosures in a replicated design, to tease out the conditions that promote successful colonization by translocated individuals. Overall success of the translocation will be judged by population viability, but we also set two benchmarks (initial survival and reproduction; completion of the life cycle through subsequent recruitment of offspring) to monitor progress. So far, we have monitored the translocated individuals long enough to determine that they have survived and are reproducing. Modeling of the influence of the environment on successful establishment suggests that soil and light conditions are important influences, but in a complex way that implicates the overriding importance of habitat heterogeneity. The Florida sand skink appears to be a resilient species that exploits the available habitat heterogeneity to find suitable microhabitats, and we suggest that these characteristics of the habitat and species contributed to its successful meeting of the first benchmark. These characteristics may contribute to successful translocation of xeric reptiles in general.","10.1111/acv.12145","CE","CE_10482",286,0.272034256254125,0.363624227486624,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Translocation sites included several elevations, and extended to sites with vegetation assemblages not typically associated with desert tortoises in order to explore the possibility of moving animals to upper elevation areas. We measured survivorship, reproduction, and movements of translocated and resident animals at each site. Survivorship was not significantly different between translocated and resident animals within and among sites, and survivorship was greater overall during non-drought years. The number of eggs produced by tortoises was similar for translocated and resident females, but differed among sites. Animals translocated to atypical habitat generally moved until they reached vegetation communities more typical of desert tortoise habitat. Even within typical tortoise habitat, tortoises tended to move greater distances in the first year after translocation than did residents, but their movements in the second or third year after translocation were indistinguishable from those of resident tortoises. Our data show that tortoises translocated into typical Mojave desert scrub habitats perform well; however, the large first-year movements of translocated tortoises have important management implications. Projects that employ translocations must consider how much area will be needed to contain translocated tortoises and whether roads need fencing to prevent the loss of animals. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

We investigated the impact of foxes on the nests of the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) and occasional green turtle (Chelonia mydas) over ten nesting seasons. Meshing of nests with fox exclusion devices (FEDs) was undertaken in all years accompanied by lethal fox control in the first five-year period, but not in the second five-year period. Lethal fox control was undertaken in the study area from 2005 to February 2010, but foxes still breached 27% (range19-52%) of turtle nests. In the second five-year period, despite the absence of lethal fox control, the average percentage of nests breached was less than 3% (range 0-4%). Comparison of clutch depredation rates in the two five-year periods demonstrated that continuous nest meshing may be more effective than lethal fox control in mitigating the impact of foxes on turtle nests. In the absence of unlimited resources available for the eradication of exotic predators, the use of FEDs and the support and resourcing of a dedicated volunteer base can be considered an effective turtle conservation tool on some beaches.","10.1371/journal.pone.0171831","CE","CE_10488",217,0.323365001041583,0.0738922230677481,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Wildlife farming has been proposed to promote sustainable trade, but characterizing markets and understanding consumer behavior remain neglected but essential steps in the design and evaluation of such operations. We used sea turtle trade in the Cayman Islands, where turtles have been farm raised for human consumption for almost 50 years, as a case study to explore consumer preferences toward wild-sourced (illegal) and farmed (legal) products and potential conservation implications. Combining methods innovatively (including indirect questioning and choice experiments), we conducted a nationwide trade assessment through in-person interviews from September to December 2014. Households were randomly selected using disproportionate stratified sampling, and responses were weighted based on district population size. We approached 597 individuals, of which 37 (6.2%) refused to participate. Although 30% of households had consumed turtle in the previous 12 months, the purchase and consumption of wild products was rare (e.g., 64742 resident households consumed wild turtle meat [i.e., 0.33.5% of households] but represented a large threat to wild turtles in the area due to their reduced populations). Differences among groups of consumers were marked, as identified through choice experiments, and price and source of product played important roles in their decisions. Despite the long-term practice of farming turtles, 13.5% of consumers showed a strong preference for wild products, which demonstrates the limitations of wildlife farming as a single tool for sustainable wildlife trade. By using a combination of indirect questioning, choice experiments, and sales data to investigate demand for wildlife products, we obtained insights about consumer behavior that can be used to develop conservation-demand-focused initiatives. Lack of data from long-term socialecological assessments hinders the evaluation of and learning from wildlife farming.

We measured their effects on survival of a translocated population of an endangered lizard in New Zealand. Twelve captive-reared Otago skinks (Oligosoma otagense) were translocated to a 0.3-ha area of grassland/shrubland cleared of invasive mammals and surrounded by a mammal-resistant fence. Sixteen more skinks were released 2 years later but this was followed by an incursion of mice for c. 160 days. Peak mouse density was at least 63 per hectare, and they were seen attacking adult skinks (> 25 cm in length), which is previously undocumented for this lizard species. Using photo/re-sight methods and Program MARK, we estimated skink survival (phi) and detectability (p) in the presence of mice (second cohort: phi = 0.15 per annum, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.01 - 0.48; p = 0.28, 0.20 - 0.38) and in their absence (first cohort: phi = 0.44 p.a., 95% CI 0.03 - 0.82; p = 0.29, 0.22 - 0.39). Survival of skinks from the first cohort during the mouse incursion was unaffected, presumably because they were already established and had access to familiar or more optimal refugia. Their survival over the entire 3 years of monitoring (0.83, 95% CI 0.60 - 0.93) compared favourably with published estimates for viable populations in the wild, protected from all invasive mammals.

We investigated the effects of sand temperature on emergence success and sex ratio of Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) hatchlings in in situ and relocated nests in Alas Purwo National Park (APNP), East Java, Indonesia. Over two years of observation no in situ nests survived due to predation, while emergence success in relocated nests varied between the years. Temperatures above 34°C experienced by the nests over at least three consecutive days during incubation (T3dm) had decreased emergence success in both years. These high temperatures occurred as a result of metabolic heating of developing embryos combined with high sand temperatures. The indirect method of determining sex ratios from nest temperature profiles indicated that the hatchery at APNP generated more male hatchlings than female. Our study provides justification for on-going egg relocation to the hatchery as a conservation management strategy.

In the present study we assessed the species richness, diversity, abundance, and functional guilds of amphibians and reptiles inside and outside of the NPA Reserva Estatal de la Biósfera Sierra San Juan (REBSSJ), Nayarit, Mexico. Our results showed that species numbers of amphibian and reptiles were higher outside than inside the reserve, as well the individual number distributed among species, except for lizard species. Analyses of functional guilds showed that both richness and functional dispersion were greater in amphibians and reptiles outside the reserve. Likewise, outside the reserve we recorded a higher species number with some category of risk at the national level (NOM-059), international level (IUCN), and also by using the Environmental Vulnerability Score (EVS) algorithm. The results suggest that areas outside of the reserve are crucial to the maintenance of regional biodiversity, due to high complementarity with species composition inside of the reserves. These data can be used to implement conservation measures that include a new demarcation of the reserve and the consideration of surrounding areas to include a great number of species.","10.3897/natureconservation.21.12875","CE","CE_10496",225,0.343758444186368,0.28747291023055,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The effect of e-flows on fish, waterbirds and vegetation has been assessed in Australia, but their influence on turtles remains largely unstudied. We opportunistically examined the effect of e-flows on the eastern longnecked turtle (Chelodina longicollis), a species that occupies ephemeral aquatic habitats, by measuring an index of abundance (catch per unit effort) and body condition before and after an environmental watering event that replenished a severely contracted creek in the mid-Murray region. We found that average body condition increased after watering. Abundance decreased markedly after watering, but the change was not statistically significant. While the causal inference of our study was limited by the opportunistic nature of our before-after experimental design, this study provides preliminary evidence that environmental flows may improve the health of turtles occupying ephemeral floodplain habitats.Weencourage further research into the effect of e-flows on turtles to confirm the hypothesis that the increase in average body condition recorded in the current study was a function of e-flows.","10.1071/ZO16076","CE","CE_10497",188,0.148093254659167,0.131226509517167,"200","neutral","neutral_200",1

Yet, repeated mechanical or prescribed fire treatments may gradually change forest structure and microhabitat conditions, favoring some taxa and decreasing suitability for others. We experimentally assessed long-term (intermittent years, 20032016) effects of repeated dormant-season mechanical and prescribed fire treatments on capture rates of reptiles and amphibians in southern Appalachian upland hardwood forests. Treatments were mechanical understory removal (twice), prescribed burning (4 times; burn-only), mechanical understory removal followed 1 year later by high-severity prescribed burns and 3 subsequent burns (mechanical + burn), and untreated controls. Initial burns were hotter in mechanical + burn than burn-only units, resulting in heavy tree mortality and increased canopy openness within 2 growing-seasons post-burn. We captured 4,606 individuals of 15 amphibian and 20 reptile species. Capture rates of American toads (Anaxyrus americanus), green frogs (Lithobates clamitans), plethodontid salamanders (Plethodon spp.), and northern red salamanders (Pseudotriton ruber) were not affected by any fuel reduction treatment. The capture rate of five-lined skinks (Plestiodon fasciatus) was greater in mechanical + burn than burn-only or control units, and the capture rate of eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) was greater in mechanical + burn than control units. Juvenile eastern fence lizard captures were greater in mechanical + burn units and increased over time, indicating that high-severity burning followed by repeated burns may improve conditions for successful recruitment.

10499,2011,"Recovery of saltwater crocodiles following unregulated hunting in tidal rivers of the Northern Territory, Australia","Journal of Wildlife Management","Saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in the Northern Territory of Australia were protected in 1971, after a severe population decline resulting from 26 yr of intense commercial hunting. By that time wild saltwater crocodiles were rarely sighted anywhere and they were commercially extinct in areas where they had once been abundant. Standardized monitoring by spotlight surveys started in 1975 and provided relative density indices over time (1975-2009) as a unique record of the post-protection recovery of a wild crocodilian population. We examined the survey data for populations at 12 major tidal rivers, individually and as a single subpopulation. The pattern of recovery in the subpopulation in both abundance and biomass was approximated by logistic curves, predicting 5.26 non-hatchling crocodiles weighing 387.64 kg sighted per kilometer of river in 2010. We predicted potential carrying capacity as 5.58 non-hatchling crocodiles (5.73% higher than 2010) weighing 519.0 kg (25.31% higher than 2010). Individual rivers showed largely different abundance and biomass among rivers. The statistical model that best described the recovery in individual rivers was not always logistic. However, where it was logistic, expected carrying capacity of different rivers showed considerable variation in abundance and biomass. The variation indicates different habitat quality among the rivers. Recovery occurred despite various consumptive uses, particularly a widespread egg-harvest program, which has been an integral part of the incentive-driven conservation program for saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory since 1983. We suggest that the saltwater crocodile population of the Northern Territory is achieving full recovery from uncontrolled hunting in 1945-1971. Although saltwater crocodiles are considered an important natural resource, their increase in number, size, and distribution is posing management issues for public safety. Continuation of human-crocodile conflict management through public education and strategic removal of problem crocodiles will be essential.

10502,2015,"Mitigating reptile road mortality: Fence failures compromise ecopassage effectiveness","PLoS ONE","Roadways pose serious threats to animal populations. The installation of roadway mitigation measures is becoming increasingly common, yet studies that rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of these conservation tools remain rare. A highway expansion project in Ontario, Canada included exclusion fencing and ecopassages as mitigation measures designed to offset detrimental effects to one of the most imperial groups of vertebrates, reptiles. Taking a multispecies approach, we used a Before-After-Control-Impact study design to compare reptile abundance on the highway before and after mitigation at an Impact site and a Control site from 1 May to 31 August in 2012 and 2013. During this time, radio telemetry, wildlife cameras, and an automated PIT-tag reading system were used to monitor reptile movements and use of ecopassages. Additionally, a willingness to utilize experiment was conducted to quantify turtle behavioral responses to ecopassages. We found no difference in abundance of turtles on the road between the un-mitigated and mitigated highways, and an increase in the percentage of both snakes and turtles detected dead on the road post-mitigation, suggesting that the fencing was not effective. Although ecopassages were used by reptiles, the number of crossings through ecopassages was lower than road-surface crossings. Furthermore, turtle willingness to use ecopassages was lower than that reported in previous arena studies, suggesting that effectiveness of ecopassages may be compromised when alternative crossing options are available (e.g., through holes in exclusion structures). Our rigorous evaluation of reptile roadway mitigation demonstrated that when exclusion structures fail, the effectiveness of population connectivity structures is compromised. Our project emphasizes the need to design mitigation measures with the biology and behavior of the target species in mind, to implement mitigation designs in a rigorous fashion, and quantitatively evaluate road mitigation to ensure allow for adaptive management and optimization of these increasingly important conservation tools.","10.1371/journal.pone.0120537","CE","CE_10502",302,0.300034832689331,0.0630138097200116,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
10504,2017,"A structurally enriched agricultural landscape maintains high reptile diversity in sub-arid south-western Madagascar","Journal of Applied Ecology","The concept of biodiversity conservation relies primarily on protected areas. Yet, protected areas are influenced by the surrounding anthropogenic matrix as degradation of landscapes used by humans also has negative consequences on species within the adjacent protected, non-degraded ecosystems. Increasing the heterogeneity of the anthropogenic landscape has the potential to promote biodiversity conservation in protected and non-protected sites. To find options for reconciling land use and biodiversity conservation, we evaluated reptile diversity of two areas. Both areas contained three types of habitat: cultivated areas, degraded forest and undegraded forest. In one area (Tsim), a network of hedges surrounding fields provided a variety of possible resources for reptile species. Another area (Andremba) lacked such landscape elements. In 480 survey walks on 48 transects evenly distributed over two areas, we recorded a total of 24 reptile species, of which 18 occurred in both areas. Perennial plant cover explained the variation in local (per transect) species richness best. Species richness was low along field margins in the cultivated area that lacked hedges and had a perennial plant cover below 20%. It was high in undegraded and degraded forest and along hedges in the cultivated area where perennial plant cover was above 40%. Similarities of reptile assemblages were higher between habitat types in the area structurally enriched with hedges, than in the area lacking such enrichment. In the latter area, beta diversity was largely the result of species losses which could result from impeded movement between habitats. Synthesis and applications. A continuous network of hedges and associated trees and shrubs contribute to the maintenance of reptile biodiversity in dry south-western Madagascar. When present, these interconnected landscape elements enhance habitat suitability of the agriculturally used matrix. They also provide habitat for species of conservation concern. High similarity between assemblages in the area with hedges indicated that movement between habitats was facilitated. We conclude that incorporating hedges in pastures contributes not just to the suitability of the matrix, but also enhances landscape connectivity and thus improves biodiversity conservation in the human-used landscape.","10.1111/1365-2664.12752","CE","CE_10504",334,0.321553474623508,0.201802522369348,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Between 2010 and 2013, cattle were excluded from six hectares of lowland heath, in southern England, that had been subject to annual summer cattle grazing between May 1997 and autumn 2009. Changes in grass snake Natrix natrix, common lizard Zootoca vivipara, slow worm Anguis fragilis and sand lizard Lacerta agilis numbers were recorded annually in the ungrazed area and in a four hectare area of heathland adjacent to it that continued to be grazed. The number of grass snake, common lizard and slow worm sightings were significantly higher in the ungrazed heath than the grazed heath and were associated with increased habitat structure, resulting principally from increased height and cover of grasses, particularly Molinia caerulea. Conversely, there was no significant difference in the number of adult sand lizard sightings between the grazed and ungrazed heath though sighting frequency was inversely correlated with both grass and grass litter cover. Our results suggest that the use of cattle grazing as a management tool on lowland heath is detrimental to grass snake, slow worm and common lizard populations but may be less so to adult sand lizards. Although newborn slow worms and common lizards were observed throughout the study area, significantly fewer were found in the grazed areas than the ungrazed areas.

10507,2013,"Evaluation of predator-exclusion cages used in turtle conservation: Cost analysis and effects on nest environment and proxies of hatchling fitness","Wildlife Research","Context A main goal of conservation is to mitigate anthropogenic impacts on natural ecosystems, thus conservation tools themselves should not negatively affect target species. Predator-exclusion cages are effectively used to reduce predation of turtle nests; however, their effects on nest environment and developing hatchlings have not been examined. Aims Our study had the following four goals: (1) to examine effects of cages on the nest environment, (2) determine whether nest caging affects proxies for hatchling fitness, (3) evaluate whether nest predators preferentially interact with certain cage types, and (4) assess the cost-effectiveness of different nest caging designs. Methods In 2010 and 2011 in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, painted turtle (Chrysemys picta; n=93) and snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina; n=91) nests were assigned to one of three treatments (wooden-sided cages, above- and below-ground wire cages) or a control (no nest cage) and outfitted with a data logger to record incubation temperature. After emergence, hatching success and proxies of hatchling fitness were measured. Key results Nest temperature, hatching success, frequency of hatchling deformities and locomotor performance did not differ among cage treatments. However, hatchling body condition differed among treatments; wooden-sided and below-ground cages had the most positive influence on body condition in painted and snapping turtles, respectively. Predator interactions did not differ among treatments, and wooden-sided cages were the most inexpensive to construct. Conclusions Nest cages did not alter the nest environment from natural conditions but did alter hatchling body condition, and nest caging affected species differently. Implications Nest cages are known to reduce nest depredation, and our data indicated that, in general, nest cages also do not affect the nest environment or proxies for hatchling fitness. Thus, our findings indicated that cages are effective conservation tools that do not present secondary deleterious effects on potential recruitment. © CSIRO 2013.","10.1071/WR13090","CE","CE_10507",296,0.258675749749872,0.206827937100955,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

However, this approach may not be applicable in all cases, in particular for data-limited stocks, which may suffer from uncertain catch information and consequently lack reliable estimates of fishing mortality. In this study we develop an approach to obtain proxies for changes in fishing mortality based on effort information and predicted stock distribution. Cod in the Kattegat is used as an example. We use GAM analyses to predict local cod densities and combine this with spatio-temporal data of fishing effort based on VMS (Vessel Monitoring System). To quantify local fishing impact on the stock, retention probability of the gears is taken into account. The results indicate a substantial decline in the impact of the Danish demersal trawl fleet on cod in the Kattegat in recent years, due to a combination of closed areas, introduction of selective gears and changes in overall effort. © 2013 © 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

11629,2012,"Can catch share fisheries better track management targets?","Fish and Fisheries","Fisheries management based on catch shares - divisions of annual fleet-wide quotas among individuals or groups - has been strongly supported for their economic benefits, but biological consequences have not been rigorously quantified. We used a global meta-analysis of 345 stocks to assess whether fisheries under catch shares were more likely to track management targets set for sustainable harvest than fisheries managed only by fleet-wide quota caps or effort controls. We examined three ratios: catch-to-quota, current exploitation rate to target exploitation rate and current biomass to target biomass. For each, we calculated the mean response, variation around the target and the frequency of undesirable outcomes with respect to these targets. Regional effects were stronger than any other explanatory variable we examined. After accounting for region, we found the effects of catch shares primarily on catch-to-quota ratios: these ratios were less variable over time than in other fisheries. Over-exploitation occurred in only 9% of stocks under catch shares compared to 13% of stocks under fleet-wide quota caps. Additionally, over-exploitation occurred in 41% of stocks under effort controls, suggesting a substantial benefit of quota caps alone. In contrast, there was no evidence for a response in the biomass of exploited populations because of either fleet-wide quota caps or individual catch shares. Thus, for many fisheries, management controls improve under catch shares in terms of reduced variation in catch around quota targets, but ecological benefits in terms of increased biomass may not be realized by catch shares alone. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00429.x","CE","CE_11629",253,0.389565400226237,0.122910269700564,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

From the early 2000s, discarding of common megrim in the northern North Sea has been widespread. In this study, we investigated temporal variation in megrim discarding in the mixed demersal fishery in the northern North Sea before, and following recent quota increases. Furthermore, logistic regression models were applied to investigate the effects of a range of explanatory factors on the probability of individual fish being discarded. Results indicate that discarding on the vessels sampled has declined from an average of 54% of the total common megrim catch in 2009 to 20% in 2012. The decrease in total discards was primarily a result of a decrease in the proportions of discards categorized by the crew as small within the catches from 0.39 (±0.02 s.e.) in 2009 to 0.10 (±0.01 s.e.) in 2012. Model outputs also suggest that the likelihood of a fish being discarded decreases significantly (p < 0.001) with increasing quota. The current megrim total allowable catch serves only to regulate landings and does little to regulate fishing mortality. Additionally, the proposed reform of the CFP, including the move towards a discards ban and the implementation of maximum sustainable yield, raises a number of concerns that need to be addressed if the northern North Sea mixed demersal fishery is to be managed sustainably and remain economically viable in the future. © 2014 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

These stocks vary in status from lightly exploited to rebuilding to severely depleted. Previous studies suggested that this variability could result from differences in life-history characteristics and economic incentives, but differences in exploitation histories and management measures also have a strong effect on current stock status. Although the status (biomass and fishing mortality rate) of major tuna and billfish stocks is well documented, the effect of these diverse factors on current stock status and the effect of management measures in rebuilding stocks have not been analysed at the global level. Here, we show that, particularly for tunas, stocks were more depleted if they had high commercial value, were long-lived species, had small pre-fishing biomass and were subject to intense fishing pressure for a long time. In addition, implementing and enforcing total allowable catches (TACs) had the strongest positive influence on rebuilding overfished tuna and billfish stocks. Other control rules such as minimum size regulations or seasonal closures were also important in reducing fishing pressure, but stocks under TAC implementations showed the fastest increase of biomass. Lessons learned from this study can be applied in managing large industrial fisheries around the world. In particular, tuna regional fisheries management organizations should consider the relative effectiveness of management measures observed in this study for rebuilding depleted large pelagic stocks.","10.1111/faf.12163","CE","CE_11631",238,0.283290891737449,0.248614090593365,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Several management measures were taken during the decline, including reductions in total allowable catch and a minimum size limit. Concurrently, removals by the otter trawl fishery were drastically reduced following the collapse of the cod (Gadus morhua) fishery. In 2003, recruitment increased and continued to be high for 6 years. Fishing mortality rates were moderate in the late 1990s and 2000s and the population increased. By 2009, the Atlantic halibut population was highly productive with both high biomass and high levels of recruitment.

This diversity in the degree of harvest rights may influence the effectiveness of IQ fisheries to meet management objectives. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 167 stocks managed under IQs to test whether the strength of harvest rights impacts the conservation status of stocks in terms of catch, exploitation rate and biomass relative to management targets. We used non-parametric methods to assess non-linear relationships and linear regression models to explicitly consider interactions among predictors. Most IQ fisheries consistently met fleet-wide quota limits (94% of stocks had recent catches below or within 10% of quotas), but only 2/3 of IQ fisheries adhered to sustainable management targets for biomass and exploitation rate (68% of stocks had exploitation rates below or within 10% of targets and 63% of stocks had biomass above or within 10% of biomass targets). Strikingly, when exclusivity of the harvesting privilege was low, exploitation rates depended on whether IQ implementation was industry-driven (exploitation below targets) or government-mandated (exploitation above targets). At high levels of exclusivity, exploitation rates converged to just below management targets. Transferability of quota units was associated with stock biomass closer to and slightly above target levels than stocks with non-transferable quota. However, regional differences had the strongest effect on biomass, suggesting that other management or biological attributes of regional fishery systems have greater influence on marine populations.","10.1111/faf.12094","CE","CE_11633",249,0.334165065053268,0.0242627795915685,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Two protection areas which, historically, have been targeted by fisheries directed at blue ling (Molva dypterygia), were defined. The study aims to assess the effectiveness of restricting fishing activity within the protection areas during the blue ling spawning period (March-May) and to determine whether the existing boundaries are fit for purpose. Estimations of the spatial apportionment of blue ling landings within and outside the protection areas are achieved by combining low-resolution data from fishing vessel logbook entries with higher-resolution vessel monitoring system (VMS) data. High-resolution spatial apportionment of blue ling landings is limited by a lack of high-resolution logbook data, and certain assumptions need to be made on whether vessels are engaging in fishing activity at any individual VMS data point, based on vessel speed and types of fishing gear available. Although current measures appear to have influenced fishing activity in the vicinity of the protection areas, more evidence is needed for a robust evaluation of their effectiveness in protecting blue ling.

The effects of mitigation measures (including fishing gear modification, time/area closures, bycatch quotas and caps, incentive programs, and fleet communication programs) have been evaluated with respect to reducing bycatch and discards. Less attention has been focused on evaluating unanticipated results related to shifts in fishing effort, changes in the size of non-target species caught, reduced catch of target species, and economic viability to fishing fleets. Time/area closures, bycatch quotas/caps, and fleet communication programmes were evaluated against a set of criteria to assess overall effectiveness in reducing bycatch without causing unintended biological and socio-economic impacts.

11638,2016,"Benefits of marine protected areas for tropical coastal sharks","Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems","Coastal sharks face increasing pressure from anthropogenic impacts and environmental change. Estimated population declines in some species have created uncertainty about the effectiveness of existing management approaches. In particular, there are scarce data on the benefits of marine protected areas (MPAs) for sharks, including whether they can be used to conserve multiple sympatric species comprising diverse life histories and habitat use patterns. This study used fishery-independent longline and gill-net surveys to investigate the effects of sub-bay-sized MPAs (c. 100300 km2) on the abundance and community structure of tropical coastal sharks. In addition, tagrecapture data from fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources were used to investigate the movements of individuals across MPA boundaries. Species composition varied significantly between management zones, and overall shark abundance on longlines was higher inside MPAs. Lengthfrequency distributions of blacktip (Carcharhinus tilstoni/Carcharhinus limbatus) and pigeye (Carcharhinus amboinensis) sharks inside MPAs included a greater proportion of sharks larger than c. 800 mm compared with those in open zones, although results varied between gear types for pigeye sharks. Tagging and recapture locations indicated repeated and potentially long-term use of MPAs by individuals of some species. Although the potential benefits of MPAs were not equal for all species, coastal MPAs may increase the survival of young sharks to maturity, or shelter parts of breeding stocks, and therefore do not necessarily need to be large to provide benefits.

We developed a dedicated expert survey, focused at the ecosystem level, with a series of questions addressing aspects of management and governance, from an ecosystem-based perspective, using objective and evidence-based criteria. The survey was completed by ecosystem experts (managers and scientists) and results analysed using ranking and multivariate methods. Results were further examined for selected ecosystems, using expert knowledge, to explore the overall findings in greater depth. Higher scores for Management Effectiveness and Governance Quality were significantly and positively related to ecosystems with better ecological status. Key factors that point to success in delivering fisheries and conservation objectives were as follows: the use of reference points for management, frequent review of stock assessments, whether Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) catches were being accounted for and addressed, and the inclusion of stakeholders.

Genetic management, by mixing founders from both a reintroduced and highly productive site (Tiritiri Matangi) and the only naturally occurring extant population (Little Barrier), appears successful with at least one mixed pairing producing fledglings in the first breeding season after release. Monitoring this population is challenging due to the large area and rugged terrain of the reserve. However, closed mark-recapture analysis based on a 15-day survey about 1 year after release indicated that between 15 and 41 (19-52%) of the translocated hihi had survived. Unringed hihi were also observed during this survey (25 observations but it is unknown how many of these were the same individuals), indicating successful breeding in the first year. If they persist and thrive in the longer term, this translocation will provide an important hihi population at a large mainland site and will contribute to the ongoing ecological restoration of Maungatautari.",NA,"CE","CE_2348",172,0.261053260607196,0.136991493861874,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
2626,2011,"Autumn-sowing of cereals reduces breeding bird numbers in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape","Biological Conservation","The switch from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereals and the loss of habitat heterogeneity are often suggested to be key drivers of breeding bird decline on arable farmland. Yet, both factors are interlinked and it remains uncertain whether autumn-sown cereals reduce breeding bird numbers also in the structurally complex arable farmland of northern Europe. We tested whether autumn-sowing of cereals at both local and landscape scales affected the breeding bird community in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape of south-central Sweden. Rotation between sowing types was used as a semi-experiment based on 34 spring- vs. 41 autumn-sown cereal plots centred on infield non-crop islands of similar structure, size and surroundings. Species richness and territory abundance of ground-foraging species were significantly lower in autumn- than in spring-sown cereal plots both in the crop fields and the infield non-crop islands during the breeding season. No such effect was observed among foliage gleaning birds. Species richness in spring-sown cereal plots was less the more autumn-sown crops in the surrounding landscape within a 500. m radius. Average skylark densities did not differ between autumn- and spring-sown cereal plots because habitat preferences changed; densities declined in autumn-sown cereals during the growing season whereas they increased on spring-sown fields which had shorter swards throughout the breeding season. Our results indicate that negative effects of autumn-sown crops on breeding bird numbers spill over into both neighbouring non-crop and crop habitats. We conclude that agri-environmental schemes should place more emphasis on facilitating the value of the cropped area of fields as a foraging and nesting habitat. The retention of various non-crop habitats alone may not provide sufficient food close to nest sites for farmland birds that rely on crop fields for foraging. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,"CE","CE_2626",300,0.13053314021729,0.0105407134078097,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
2901,2011,"Cereal-based wholecrop silages: a potential conservation measure for farmland birds in pastoral landscapes","Biological Conservation","Declines of farmland birds have been pronounced in landscapes dominated by lowland livestock production and densities of seed-eating birds are particularly low in such areas. Modern livestock production often entails a simple cropping system dominated by ley grassland and maize grown for animal feed. These crops often lack invertebrate and seed resources for foraging birds and can be hostile nesting environments. Cereal-based wholecrop silages (CBWCS) offer potential benefits for farmland birds because they can be grown with minimal herbicide applications and can be spring-sown with following winter stubbles. We compared the biodiversity benefits and agronomic yields of winter-sown wheat and spring-sown barley as alternatives to grass and maize silage in intensive dairy livestock systems. Seed-eating birds foraged mainly in CBWCS fields during summer, and mainly on barley stubbles during winter and this reflected the higher densities of seed-bearing plants therein. Maize and grass fields lacked seed-bearing vegetation and were strongly avoided by most seed-eating birds. Production costs of CBWCS are similar to those of maize and lower than those of grass silage. Selective (rather than broad-spectrum) herbicide application on spring barley crops increased forb cover, reduced yields (by 11%) but caused only a small (<4%) increase in production costs. CBWCS grown with selective herbicide and with following winter stubbles offer a practical conservation measure for seed-eating farmland birds in landscapes dominated by intensively-managed grassland and maize. However, the relatively early harvesting of CBWCS could destroy a significant proportion of breeding attempts of late-nesting species like corn bunting (Emberiza calandra) or yellow wagtail (Motocilla flava). Where late-breeding species are likely to nest in CBWCS fields, harvesting should be delayed until most nesting attempts have been completed (e.g. until after 1st August in southern Britain). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,"CE","CE_2901",298,0.241954247221125,0.0523416519072033,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

However, there have been recent declines and the colonies continue to face ongoing threats from habitat change and excessive commercial harvesting of their eggs, as well as potential threats by commercial fishing and climate change. A possible method to counter these threats is to re-establish breeding colonies on islands from which they have disappeared. An attempt was made to attract birds to a previously occupied island through habitat management, decoy birds and playback of recorded sooty tern calls. Habitat preparation involved predator eradication and tree removal to provide open ground with bare sandy areas and low herb vegetation. Overflying birds were attracted by broadcast calls, with some circling over and landing among the decoys. Large three-dimensional plastic models were superior to other models presented. This study demonstrated that large numbers of birds can be attracted by these means and that the birds then undertook behaviour associated with breeding, including egg laying by a few birds. However, after five seasons a breeding colony has not yet been established; one possible cause is the emergence of unexpected egg predators, common moorhen Gallinula chloropus and common myna Acridotheres tristis.",NA,"CE","CE_5498",198,0.240590044854166,0.0931443223840496,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

The number of breeding pairs of saker falcons increased at a faster rate than ravens, reflecting their social dominance. Saker falcons and common ravens preferred to breed inside closed-box artificial nests with a roof, whereas upland buzzards preferred open-top nests. For saker falcons nest survival was higher in closed nests than open nests but there was no significant difference in laying date, clutch size and brood size in relation to nest design.

5916,2013,"Evaluation of artificial nests as a conservation tool for three forest-dwelling raptors","Animal Conservation","Forest age structure has become younger and the amount of old forest has decreased due to intensive forestry in Northern Europe. Consequently, large forest-dwelling hawks may lack nest sites as they need large trees to support their nests. Construction of artificial nests has been a globally adopted conservation measure to provide nest sites for several raptors, but the impact of this practice has seldom been evaluated. We compared the nesting success of northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis, common buzzard Buteo buteo, and honey buzzard Pernis apivorus in natural and artificial nests based on long-term data in Finland. The probability of successful nesting of goshawk and common buzzard was lower in artificial nests, whereas no difference was found in the nesting success of honey buzzard between the nest types. Brood size did not differ between natural and artificial nests in successful nests of any of the three species. Finally, distances to anthropogenic features had no effect on nesting success. These results indicate that hawks switching from natural to artificial nests are potentially lured to an ecological trap with higher risk of nesting failure. However, breeding at artificial nests, even with lower success than in natural nests, can still add to the population, if otherwise nonbreeding individuals settle to nest. It should be investigated which part of the population breeds in artificial nests and whether the site selection for artificial nests needs revision.

5921,2015,"Seabird recovery and vegetation dynamics after Norway rat eradication at Tromelin Island, western Indian Ocean","Biological Conservation","Seabirds are notoriously sensitive to introduced mammalian predators and eradication programs have benefitted seabird populations and their habitats on numerous islands throughout the world. However, less evidence is available from the tropics as to the benefits of rat eradication. Here, we report the seabird recovery and vegetation dynamics on a small coralline island of the tropical western Indian Ocean, eight years after Norway rat (. Rattus norvegicus) eradication. Two species of seabirds were breeding before rat eradication (red-footed and masked boobies, Sula sula and Sula, dactylatra) and, in both species, the number of breeding pairs had an apparent increase of 22-23% per year after rat eradication. Such a high annual growth rate cannot be achieved by auto-recruitment only and our data suggest that immigration from other source populations never occurred in at least one of these species. We suggest that it is rather due to a rapid increase in breeding success, which rapidly increased the observed number of breeders since birds remained in the available-for-counting-as-breeders group for much longer. Two other species, the white tern (. Gygis alba) and the brown booby (. Sula leucogaster) were recorded breeding in 2014. The former species has not bred on the island since 1856 and the latter has never bred on the island. Plant cover (monospecific formation of the ruderal herb Boerhavia diffusa) dramatically increased from less than 30% of surface coverage to more than 70%. Although the initial restoration project was to eradicate all introduced mammals of the island simultaneously, house mouse (. Mus musculus) eradication failed. Mouse density was high 8. years after rat eradication (32. mice/ha in dry season and 52. mice/ha in rainy season) but not higher than at a comparable tropical island of the region (Juan de Nova) where mice coexist with introduced black rats (. Rattus rattus) and feral cats (. Felis catus). These results are discussed in terms of the direct positive effects of rat eradication on seabirds and plants and the indirect positive effects of post-eradication seabird increase on soil manuring and vegetation recovery. Overall, our results show that on tropical islands, seabird and habitat recovery can be very rapid after rat eradication and should be implemented as a restoration tool wherever possible.",NA,"CE","CE_5921",363,0.257381931305761,-0.0149835935528273,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Data on birds collected during the nonbreeding season are particularly lacking. We captured birds in mist nets and resighted banded birds to estimate species richness and diversity, abundance, demographic indexes, and site-level persistence of permanent-resident and overwintering migrants in remnant and restored riparian sites in California. Species richness in riparian remnants was significantly higher than in restored sites because abundances of uncommon permanent residents were greater in remnants. Species richness of overwintering migrants did not differ between remnants and restored sites. Responses among overwintering migrants (but not permanent residents) to remnant and restored riparian sites differed. Capture rates were higher in remnant or restored riparian sites for 7 of 10 overwintering migratory species. For Lincoln's Sparrows (Melospiza lincolnii) and White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) proportions of older birds were significantly higher in remnants, even though capture rates of these species were higher in restored sites. Overwinter persistence of 4 migrant species was significantly higher in remnant than in restored sites. A higher proportion of Hermit Thrushes (Catharus guttatus, 56.3%), older Fox Sparrows (Passerella iliaca, 57.1%), Lincoln's Sparrows (59.7%), and White-crowned Sparrows (67.8%) persisted in remnants than restored sites.

6211,2012,"Impact of cattle grazing on the occupancy of a cryptic, threatened rail","Ecological Applications","Impacts of livestock grazing in arid and semiarid environments are often concentrated in and around wetlands where animals congregate for water, cooler temperatures, and green forage. We assessed the impacts of winter-spring (November-May) cattle grazing on marsh vegetation cover and occupancy of a highly secretive marsh bird that relies on dense vegetation cover, the California Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus), in the northern Sierra Nevada foothills of California, USA. Using detection- nondetection data collected during repeated call playback surveys at grazed vs. ungrazed marshes and a ""random changes in occupancy"" parameterization of a multi-season occupancy model, we examined relationships between occupancy and habitat covariates, while accounting for imperfect detection. Marsh vegetation cover was significantly lower at grazed marshes than at ungrazed marshes during the grazing season in 2007 but not in 2008. Winter- spring grazing had little effect on Black Rail occupancy at irrigated marshes. However, at nonirrigated marshes fed by natural springs and streams, grazed sites had lower occupancy than ungrazed sites. Black Rail occupancy was positively associated with marsh area, irrigation as a water source, and summer vegetation cover, and negatively associated with marsh isolation. Residual dry matter (RDM), a commonly used metric of grazing intensity, was significantly associated with summer marsh vegetation cover at grazed sites but not spring cover. Direct monitoring of marsh vegetation cover, particularly at natural spring- or streamfed marshes, is recommended to prevent negative impacts to rails from overgrazing. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/11-1021.1","CE","CE_6211",243,0.177228929957688,-0.0881293846048536,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Here we investigate possible causes of spatial variation in breeding success in two neighbouring Scots pine Pinus sylvestris woods in Scotland, Abernethy Forest and Craigmore Wood. Breeding success declined with increasing June rainfall at both sites, but there was a stronger effect at Abernethy. Average productivity (chicks/female) during 2000-2011 was 1.61 (95% C.I. 1.08-2.41) times greater at Craigmore than Abernethy. It was possible that the difference was due to increased wetting of chicks by vegetation during and after rain at Abernethy, where the vertical density of the shrub and grass layer was greater than at Craigmore. Wet chicks may then die. To test this hypothesis, 2 m wide routes were cut through tall heather Calluna vulgaris at Abernethy, so that broods could move between bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus feeding areas without having to brush against tall dense vegetation. However, there was no improvement in breeding success in the treated area compared to a control area. Possible explanations are that the capercaillies did not use the cut routes, that cutting did not provide sufficiently short vegetation, that rain affects capercaillie chicks in other ways (e.g. through insect availability), or that broods shelter from rain using pine thickets.",NA,"CE","CE_6237",212,0.393758993815202,0.0959767378819047,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Electrocution resulted from birds contacting live conductor cables either when perched at the top of the grounded steel-reinforced concrete pole or when perched on the steel crossarm. Mitigation focused on line poles and involved creating a barrier between the live conductors and perch sites at randomly selected poles. This involved attaching the pin insulator at the top of the pole with a new mount so that it was repositioned centrally to discourage birds from perching on top of the pole, while additional unconnected pin insulators were affixed adjacent to those supporting the conductor cables on the crossarm to provide a barrier to birds touching the live cables. Electrocution rates were significantly lower at mitigated poles compared to control poles, with an average reduction of 85%. This mitigation technique is relatively inexpensive to implement (approximately US$12/pole for materials), with no additional maintenance requirement and a life expectancy similar to that of the base pole design. While not eliminating electrocution risk, this mitigation technique may be useful in circumstances where the cost of implementation and sustained maintenance largely determines whether or not any form of mitigation is undertaken.",NA,"CE","CE_6861",211,0.177903959412033,0.13959622321149,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

242,2011,"Modelling the effect of fishing on southern Buller's albatross using a 60_year dataset","New Zealand Journal of Zoology","Many albatross populations are declining and a major cause is believed to be incidental mortality from fishing. We investigated the effect of fishing on southern Buller's albatross Thalassarche bulleri bulleri, using a new approach to seabird population modelling that allows estimation of demographic parameters from multiple data types. Three types of data were used: a 60-year set of mark-recapture observations, four censuses of the breeding population, and estimates of fishing effort and bycatch. The fisheries risk to the viability of this population over the last 60 years appears to have been small, since the adult population is estimated to have increased about fivefold over that time. There is some cause for concern in recent changes (population growth has slowed, and perhaps reversed, and adult survival rates are falling). The most common age at first breeding was 12 years, and about 80% of adults breed each year. Annual survival was estimated to bc 0.91 for juveniles, and varied between this value and 1 for adults. Though this population is not in immediate danger from fishing, there is a need for continued monitoring to see whether the recent fall in survival rates persists and causes a decline in abundance. Our analysis showed that when, as is common, mark-recapture data do not provide good estimates of all demographic rates, the assessment of seabird population trends can be improved by the use of other types of data, particularly abundance. © 2012 The Royal Society of New Zealand.","10.1080/03014223.2011.600766","Williams","Williams_242",238,0.143422195202801,0.059037128687809,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
243,2011,"Seabird mortality associated with ice trawlers in the Patagonian shelf: effect of discards on the occurrence of interactions with fishing gear","Animal Conservation","This study investigated the level of seabird mortality caused by the domestic trawl fleet (freshies) for hake (among other less important targets) operating in waters off central Patagonia (37-48°S), analyzing the effect of environmental and operational variability on the level of seabird interactions. With a total of 135 vessels, the fleet is one of the largest in Argentina. Specifically tasked seabird observers were placed onboard trawlers during the summer and winter seasons of the years 2006 and 2007. The type and number of seabird interactions (i.e. contacts with fishing gear) were recorded during shooting and hauling operations, covering 72days of observation and 328 trawls. Black-browed albatrosses, white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis, southern giant petrels Marconectes giganteus and southern royal albatrosses Diomedea epomophora were the most abundant species interacting with trawlers. Confirmed mortalities of black-browed and southern royal albatrosses were the result of collisions and entanglement with the warp cable while birds were scavenging. The estimated total mortality rate was 0.017 birds h-1 and 0.105 birds per vessel per day. The intensity of interactions (in terms of the number of contacts per unit time) was largely explained by the distribution of the fishing effort. Seasonality and the incidence of discards were the strongest factors explaining the occurrence of seabird interactions. The total annual mortality in the trawl fleet under investigation was roughly estimated to be from several hundred to over a thousand albatrosses. However, these figures should be considered preliminary due to the limited spatial and temporal coverage of data and the fact that estimations were based on a low number of observed mortalities. The implementation of a strategic discard management may significantly reduce the number of seabird mortalities from collisions with warp cables or improve the effectiveness of other complementary mitigation methods. Urgent implementation of mitigation measures is needed in this fleet to reduce the mortality of albatrosses and petrels along the Patagonian shelf. © 2010 The Authors.

244,2011,"Global seabird bycatch in longline fisheries","Endangered Species Research","Bycatch in longline fisheries is believed to govern the adverse conservation status of many seabird species, but no comprehensive global assessment has been undertaken. We reviewed the extent of seabird bycatch in all longline fisheries for which data are available. Despite the many inadequacies and assumptions contained therein, we estimated that at least 160 000 (and potentially in excess of 320 000) seabirds are killed annually. Most frequently caught are albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters, with current levels of mortality liable to be unsustainable for some species and popula- tions. Where realistic comparisons can be made, with data from the 1990s, there is evidence of sub- stantially reduced bycatch in some key fisheries. Reductions stem from decreased fishing effort (especially in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean), and greater and more effective use of technical mitigation measures, notably in demersal fisheries. However, bycatch problems in other fisheries have also emerged. Current concerns include those with previously unidentified bycatch problems (e.g. Spanish Gran Sol demersal fleet) and those where bycatch was identified, but where persistent data gaps prevented adequate assessments of the scale of the impact (e.g. Nordic demersal fisheries). Future assessments will only achieve greater precision when mini- mum standards of data collection, reporting and analysis are implemented by longline fishing fleets and the relevant regional fishery management organisations. Those fisheries in which bycatch has been substantially reduced demonstrate that the problem of seabird bycatch could be reduced to negligible proportions by enforced implementation of appropriate best-practice mitigation devices and techniques. © Inter-Research 2011.","10.3354/esr00347","Williams","Williams_244",254,0.240662394473827,0.0535388864054054,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
245,2011,"Impact of Taiwanese distant water longline fisheries on the Pacific seabirds: finding hotspots on the high seas","Animal Conservation","Seabird bycatch by the longline fisheries of the Pacific Ocean is a major conservation concern. However, relatively few studies have examined the impacts of distant water longline fishing on the high seas due to the difficulty associated with deploying observers. Our study addresses this data gap by analyzing data from 2666 Taiwanese scientific observation data sets from 2002 to 2007 to calculate the seabird bycatch rate and to estimate the mortality of seabirds as a result of fishing activities by the entire fleet. A total of 379 seabirds were caught and 88% were albatross. A negative binomial distribution was used to represent the observed data based on spatial and temporal stratification, which yielded bycatch rates that ranged from 0.0003 to 0.2213 birds per 1000 hooks. The bycatch rates were highest in the areas between 25-45°N and 165°E-160°W between October and March and the areas between 25-35°S and 170°E-165°W between April and September. Using the observed data for bycatch rates and total fishing effort, the estimated number of seabird deaths caused by the Taiwanese fleet ranged from 1120 to 4290 birds annually. Increasing the observer coverage of specific fleets and areas, prioritizing observer programs and combined with international cooperation in research, would improve bycatch calculations. Seabird conservation efforts can be improved by monitoring fishing effort and the mandatory implementation of multiple mitigation measures. © 2011 The Authors.

247,2011,"Albatrosses Following Fishing Vessels: How Badly Hooked Are They on an Easy Meal","PLoS ONE","Fisheries have major impacts on seabirds, both by changing food availability and by causing direct mortality of birds during trawling and longline setting. However, little is known about the nature and the spatial-temporal extent of the interactions between individual birds and vessels. By studying a system in which we had fine-scale data on bird movements and activity, and near real-time information on vessel distribution, we provide new insights on the association of a threatened albatross with fisheries. During early chick-rearing, black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophris from two different colonies (separated by only 75 km) showed significant differences in the degree of association with fisheries, despite being nearly equidistant to the Falklands fishing fleet. Most foraging trips from either colony did not bring tracked individuals close to vessels, and proportionally little time and foraging effort was spent near ships. Nevertheless, a few individuals repeatedly visited fishing vessels, which may indicate they specialise on fisheries-linked food sources and so are potentially more vulnerable to bycatch. The evidence suggests that this population has little reliance on fisheries discards at a critical stage of its nesting cycle, and hence measures to limit fisheries waste on the Patagonian shelf that also reduce vessel attractiveness and the risk of incidental mortality, would be of high overall conservation benefit. © 2011 Granadeiro et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0017467","Williams","Williams_247",219,0.150007034241737,0.0091266497731741,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

This applies particularly to the area of the continental slope, due to the high rates of incidental catch from pelagic longliners. We analyzed the temporal variation in the seabird assemblage associated with this fishery, identified the species that make use of discards, and evaluated their interactions while foraging. During 20 commercial fishing trips between 2005 and 2008, we completed 415 bird counts and recorded behavior in 172 of these. The observed species richness (=38 species) is greater than that reported for any other fishery in the region and was highest from October to April, although many species in the assemblage were significantly more abundant between May and September. Only 14 species made significant use of discards, and all of these were albatrosses and petrels captured incidentally. We observed within- and between-species competition for access to discards. In general, the frequency of intraspecific competition was greater in the most abundant species, during the period of their greatest abundance. Albatrosses were more successful in interspecific competitive interactions, and we observed a dominance hierarchy related to body size. We conclude that the composition and seasonality of the seabird bycatch is determined by the spatiotemporal dynamics of the assemblage and by the observed pattern of interspecific interactions. Discards from pelagic longline fleets operating in the BMC may be an important food source for at least 8 species of globally threatened seabirds. Understanding the effect of discards on these populations could generate useful information for conservation, although reducing bycatch levels should be considered the main goal. © Inter-Research 2011.","10.3354/esr00378","Williams","Williams_248",269,0.306160688332274,0.177160505856644,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

258,2012,"Reducing effects of trawl fishing on seabirds by limiting foraging opportunities provided by fishery waste","Emu","By-catch of seabirds on trawl-fishing gear has been reported worldwide, and is exacerbated by the discharge of fisheries waste. We compared the attraction of seabirds to three forms of fishery waste unprocessed discharge (offal, fish discards), hashed discharge (smaller chunks passed through a hasher pump) and cutter pump discharge (waste passed through the hasher and a cutter pump to further reduce particle size) to identify the discharge form that most effectively reduced the risk of seabird by-catch. Seabird responses measured within specified areas astern of the vessel were the abundance of: large albatrosses (Diomedea spp.), small albatrosses and giant-petrels (Thalassarche spp.; Southern Giant-Petrels, Macronectes giganteus; and Northern Giant-Petrels, M. halli), Cape Petrels (Daption capense) and all other procellariid species. Seabirds on the water were less numerous during cutter pump and hashed discharge relative to unprocessed discharge (except small albatrosses cutter treatment). Also, in some cases, the total number of birds decreased, relative to unprocessed discharge treatments (but not small and large albatrosses cutter treatment). Particle size may be less important for reducing abundances than temporal discharge patterns, which affected how birds tracked the discharge stream. Manipulating discharge characteristics can reduce seabird attraction to fishing vessels. However, the risk of by-catch remained lowest when no discharging occurred. © 2012 BirdLife Australia.","10.1071/MU12002","Williams","Williams_258",215,0.163977388576547,-0.0658543827319795,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
259,2012,"Direct evidence of the impact of longline fishery on mortality in the Black_footed Albatross","Bird Conservation International","Summary The incidental bycatch of seabirds in longline fisheries is one of the most striking examples of diffuse and incidental impact of human activities on vertebrate species. While there are various types of evidence of a strong impact of longline fisheries on seabirds, in particular albatrosses, the incidental bycatch mortality has never been directly linked to estimates of bycatch derived from on-board surveys. We develop a capture-recapture analysis which relates the annual probability of survival in the Black-Footed Albatross to the estimated absolute bycatch. By converting the absolute bycatch into an estimate relative to population size and using the theory of exploited populations, we show that survival probability decreases linearly with bycatch, and that the bycatch is underestimated by at least 50%, confirming suspicions based on reviews of the bycatch survey procedures, and raising further concerns about the impact of longline fisheries on seabirds.

Analysis of data from the US National Marine Fisheries Service Pelagic Observer Program (POP ) revealed a significant hook effect on seabird bycatch. Our analysis focused on the three areas with highest seabird bycatch, the northeast US coast (60°W-71°W, 35°N-42°N), the Middle Atlantic Bight (71°W-82°W, 35°N-41°N), and the South Atlantic Bight (71°W-82°W, 30°N-35°N). We developed two generalized linear models to examine effects of four hook treatments, i.e., four combinations of hook type and size (8/0 J-hook, 9/0 J-hook, 16/0 circle hook, and 18/0 circle hook), on: (1) the probability of catching seabirds on a set and (2) the positive catch rate (i.e., number of seabirds per 1000 hooks in longline sets with at least one seabird caught). Results indicated that combinations of hook type and size significantly influenced the probability of catching seabirds in the United States Atlantic pelagic longline fishery. Use of the 8/0 J-hook led to the highest probability of catching a seabird. Use of circle hooks may significantly reduce seabird bycatch in the US Atlantic pelagic longline fishery, but its effectiveness may be confounded by other factors such as bait type, fishing location, season, and target species.

261,2012,"Bycatch susceptibility in pelagic longline fisheries: are albatrosses affected by the diving behaviour of medium_sized petrels","Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems","Species of petrels and shearwaters with high diving ability could facilitate the catch of albatrosses in pelagic longline fisheries, because they retrieve bait to the surface from depths that albatrosses cannot reach. Once on the surface, large seabirds such as albatrosses can easily displace smaller species thus gaining access to baited hooks which increases their likelihood of getting caught. This paper evaluates the extent to which diving species (i.e. Procellaria aequinoctialis, Procellaria conspicillata and Puffinus gravis) increase the susceptibility of albatross to bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries. In 48 sets, attacks on baits were quantified. When more than one bird (of the same or different species) tried to attack the same bait this was defined as a multiple attack. There were 384 attacks on baits, of which 260 were made by a single individual and 124 by more than one. Multiple attacks were the largest source of bycatch of albatrosses (22 of 27 albatrosses whose attacks were observed). Of the baits attacked by albatrosses (n=244), 17% were indirectly facilitated by diving medium-sized petrels. Considering only the multiple attacks in which albatrosses participated (n=114), 36% were initiated by these medium-sized petrels. Eleven (41%) of the albatrosses captured, and whose attacks were observed, resulted from a diving medium-sized seabird species first having contacted the terminal tackle. This paper shows that medium-sized petrels, with a strong ability to dive, increase considerably the access to bait, and indirectly, the incidental bycatch of albatrosses. Observations made in the absence of mitigation measures also provide useful information to improve the performance of tori lines. Based on the seabird behaviour, it is recommended that tori lines should have a minimum aerial coverage of 50 m. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd..","10.1002/aqc.2242","Williams","Williams_261",277,0.256876578280154,-0.0526408631613932,"300","neutral","neutral_300",1

In this study, we analyze fishing effort and catch data of the Taiwanese distant-water longline tuna fleet - the largest fleet in the Atlantic Ocean. These data collected by fishery observers over a 5-year span include 61 trips involving 6181 observed sets of over 20 million hooks, where 198 seabirds were caught (23 of which were released alive). Most birds were caught in the South Atlantic, with estimated seabird bycatch rates ranging from 0.026 birds per thousand hooks in the southwest Atlantic to 0.063 birds per thousand hooks in the southeast Atlantic. Black-browed, Atlantic yellow-nosed, and wandering albatrosses, as well as spectacled and southern giant petrels, were the most frequently caught species. Seabird bycatch hotspots were identified at 20°-40°S/10°W-15°E and 35°-45°S/45°-55°W. In the South Atlantic Ocean, generalized additive models indicated that fishing location and the number of birds sighted significantly influenced seabird bycatch rates. Extrapolating these spatially and temporally explicit seabird bycatch rates to the fishing effort data of other distant-water longline fleets and extrapolating the bycatch rates reported in the literature to the reported fishing effort of coastal nation fleets, we estimate the total seabird incidental mortality from pelagic longline fishing in the southern Atlantic Ocean to be between 3446 and 6083 birds per year from 2004 to 2008. These findings support proposals calling for the required use of best-practice mitigation measures by all pelagic longline vessels operating in seabird bycatch hotspots in the South Atlantic Ocean.

264,2012,"Risk assessment and relative impact of Uruguayan pelagic longliners on seabirds","Aquatic Living Resources","Bycatch in longline fisheries is considered one of the main threats for the conservation of albatrosses and petrels worldwide. However, the relative impact of fisheries on all the affected populations or species still remains poorly understood. This paper applied a Productivity and Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) and the concept of ""Potential Biological Removal Level"" (PBR) to assess the relative impact caused by the Uruguayan pelagic longline fishery on several populations. This two-step approach allowed us to obtain an objective view of the relative impact of the Uruguayan pelagic longline fleet on most of the populations or species of albatrosses and petrels with high association with this fishery. Of fifteen species considered, fourteen were finally assessed and a ranking of risk derived. The concept of PBR was applied to the nine most at-risk species. The impact of fishing on populations could not be straightforwardly inferred from their bycatch rates. Results indicate that large albatrosses (Diomedea spp.) and Thalassarche chlororhynchos are more affected than some of the main species caught by the fishery (i.e. Thalassarche melanophrys and Procellaria aequinoctialis). Diomedea exulans from South Georgia is likely to be the population most affected by the Uruguayan fleet. This work should be seen as a case study of the fisheries operating in the southwestern Atlantic. The Uruguayan fleet within its operation area was responsible for only the 4.3% to 12.5% of the total annual effort deployed by the different fleets during 2004-2008. The combined impact of these fleets could be sufficiently high to account for many of the observed declines in the populations of D. exulans, D. dabbenena and T. chlororhynchos. However, the seabird bycatch numbers for most of the pelagic longline fleets that operate in the southwest Atlantic remain unknown. Applying mitigation measures to reduce the impact of pelagic longline fleets operating in this region should be considered a high priority. ©2012 EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD.","10.1051/alr/2012026","Williams","Williams_264",311,0.164935582324354,0.0123332572360799,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

266,2012,"Safe Leads for safe heads: safer line weights for pelagic longline fisheries","Fisheries Research","In many pelagic longline fisheries around the world there is reluctance to adopt a line weighting regime that will sink fishing gear rapidly to reduce seabird bycatch. In many cases this is due to safety concerns caused by traditional leaded swivels causing serious injuries, and even fatalities, when they fly-back at the crew in the event of line breakage (e.g. from shark bite offs) during line hauling. This paper presents the results of at-sea and on-shore trials to test the safety and operational effectiveness of an alternative line weight (the Safe Lead) which is designed to slide down, or off the line, in the event of a bite-off, significantly reducing danger to the crew from line weights. At-sea trials in South Africa revealed that Safe Leads can reduce the incidence of dangerous fly-backs to very low levels. In at-sea trails, only 4.2% of Safe Lead fly-backs reached the vessel (the remainder fell in the sea) whereas 73.3% of fly-backs by leaded swivels hit the vessel and one hit a crewmen in the head. Simulated bite-off events on shore revealed the degree of slippage (influences whether leads slide but remain on the branch line, or slide off the end of the line) varied as a function of distance from Safe Lead to hook (1-4. m range) and tension on the line (20-120 kg range). All Safe Lead replicates placed within 2. m of the hook slid off the line under all four tension treatments. Under the higher tension categories of 80 kg and 120 kg, 80% of Safe Leads positioned 3. m from the hook position slid off the line after a simulated bite-off (cut-away). High speed photography of fly-backs showed a significant (P 80% reduction in kinetic energy on impact. Our results suggest that Safe Leads are a cost-effective and operationally simple alternative to traditional leaded swivels with significant benefits to crew safety. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2012.07.024","Williams","Williams_266",321,0.38138012378729,0.103435768723645,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
279,2013,"Reducing seabird bycatch in the South African joint venture tuna fishery using bird_scaring lines, branch line weighting and nighttime setting of hooks","Fisheries Research","We compared the performance of two bird-scaring line designs (light lines with short streamers vs. hybrid lines with a mix of long and short streamers) deployed in pairs with unweighted branch lines on two joint venture tuna vessels typical of distant-water tuna fisheries in the South Africa Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). We also added weight to a subset of branch lines, and compared the effects of line weighting and night vs. day setting in combination with bird-scaring lines on bird and fish catch rates. White-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis), a diving seabird, dominated the seabird assemblage; they were the most numerous seabird and they attacked baited hooks and were killed at the highest rates. Secondary attacks - surface foraging albatrosses stealing baits from white-chinned petrels - drove albatross mortality. With hybrid scaring lines deployed, both diving and surface foraging seabirds made fewer attacks (1.5 and 2 times, respectively) within the lines' 100. m aerial extent, where hooks are closest to the surface and birds are most vulnerable to hooking, than with light lines. However, all metrics of comparison between hybrid and light lines were not statistically conclusive, primarily because birds could access baited hooks in areas beyond the protection afforded by bird-scaring lines (aft and to port of their aerial extent). Seabird bycatch rates were 4.6 times higher during daylight hours (2.00 birds/1000 hooks; 52 birds) than at night (0.439 birds/1000 hooks; 28 birds) and night catch rates near the full moon doubled. Bird catch rates were 18 times higher on unweighted branch lines (1.07/1000 hooks; 79 birds) than on weighted branch lines (0.06/1000 hooks; 1 bird) with no detectable effect on fish catch. With respect to streamer lines, our results suggest that in Procellaria petrel dominated systems the aerial extent of bird-scaring lines (of any design) should span the distance that baited hooks are within 10. m of the surface to effectively prevent bird attacks on baits. Overall, results suggest that night setting, adequate branch line weighting, and proper deployment of two bird-scaring lines have the potential to reduce seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries without reducing the catch rates of target fishes. Further development of safe, fast-sinking branch line weighting configurations and bird-scaring lines less prone to tangling on fishing gear is critical to this effort. © 2013.","10.1016/j.fishres.2013.04.015","Williams","Williams_279",371,0.178724821023803,-0.0275243596072326,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Detailed observations of seabird species abundance and attacks on baits were conducted from a longliner operating in the western North Pacific from December 2010 to January 2011. Line settings alternated between ST and PT deployments. About 90% of the seabirds attending the vessel were Laysan albatrosses (Phoebastria immutabilis), and most attacks were by this species. Attacks occurred across broad areas from 25 to 200. m of the stern during ST deployments, whereas PT deployment resulted in few attacks within 75. m of the stern. The number of secondary attacks (birds charging for the bait brought to the surface by the bird making the primary attack) was significantly lower during PT than during ST deployment. These results suggest that PT performed better than ST in reducing bait attacks, and consequently seabird mortality. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2012.11.007","Williams","Williams_281",162,0.162332513177496,-0.217693620372221,"200","negative","negative_200",0

Bycatch - the accidental catch of non-target species - spans the spectrum of marine fauna and constitutes a harvesting pressure. Individual differences in attraction to fishing vessels and consequent susceptibility to bycatch exist, but few studies integrate this individual heterogeneity with demography. Here, we tested for the evidence and consequences of individual heterogeneity on the demography of the wandering albatross, a seabird heavily affected by fisheries bycatch. We found strong evidence for heterogeneity in survival with one group of individuals having a 5.2% lower annual survival probability than another group, and a decrease in the proportion of those individuals with the lowest survival in the population coinciding with a 7.5 fold increase in fishing effort in the foraging areas. Potential causes for the heterogeneity in survival are discussed and we suggest that bycatch removed a large proportion of individuals attracted by fishing vessels and had significant phenotypic and population consequences. © 2013 Barbraud et al.","10.1371/journal.pone.0060353","Williams","Williams_282",166,0.248977530651872,0.0481231658070169,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
284,2013,"Scaling down the analysis of seabird_fishery interactions","Marine Ecology Progress Series","Seabird-fishery interactions are currently a major issue in marine conservation management. A common approach to quantifying the extent of interactions is to overlay density maps of seabird and fishing activities derived from point locations. Such large-scale evaluations of overlap can be misleading due to the static representation of birds and vessels that in reality are spatially and temporally dynamic. Additionally, overlap at large scales does not necessarily indicate interaction; overlapping distributions of seabirds and fisheries could reflect coincident use of habitat. Using 4 yr of distribution data, we conducted a fine-scale analysis of overlap between albatrosses and fishing vessels. Results were compared to those derived from large-scale density comparisons. Additionally, we compared overlap versus interaction rates by calculating the proportion of time that birds foraged in close association with a fishing vessel versus independently while within 10 km of a vessel. Results of our fine-scale analysis indicated generally low rates of overlap while foraging and high variability among sexes, years and types of fishery. Changes in overlap rates were attributed to shifts in both albatross and vessel distributions. Albatrosses foraged independently of fishing vessels half the time they were within 10 km of a vessel, indicating that 50% of overlap is due to coincident habitat use rather than vessel interaction. Overlaying of large-scale distribution maps failed to distinguish annual variation in the degree of bird-fishery overlap, and suggested overlap where none was identified at the finer scale. This study illustrates the increased insight derived from fine-scale analyses of seabird-fisheries interactions. © Inter-Research 2013.","10.3354/meps10071","Williams","Williams_284",257,0.138486983903852,0.0448071684668609,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Despite the importance of diving ability for mitigating longline bycatch, little is known of this species' diving behaviour. We obtained data from temperature-depth recorders from nine white-chinned petrels breeding on Marion Island, southwestern Indian Ocean, during the late incubation and chick-rearing period. Maximum dive depth (16 m) was slightly deeper than the previous estimate (13 m), but varied considerably among individuals (range 2-16 m). Males dived deeper than females, and birds feeding chicks dived deeper than incubating birds, but dive rate did not differ between the sexes.

Identification of the principal factors that determine this by-catch and understanding how they could be controlled is fundamental for improving the management of fisheries and so carry out a better conservation of Cory's shearwater populations in the Mediterranean. The aim of this paper was to model the longline by-catch of Mediterranean Cory's shearwater in the Spanish Mediterranean longline fishery as a function of time of the year, technical characteristics of the fishing operation, and geographical location. We used data recorded by an onboard observer program monitoring commercial longline fisheries. During the 10 years covered in this study, 80 birds were captured in 30 fishing operations out of a total of 2,587 observed fishing sets. We used favourability functions and Random Forest analyses to relate the presence of Cory's shearwater in the by-catch with the explanatory factors. The most explanatory factor in relation to incidence of by-catch was the geographical location (longitude and fishing over the continental shelf) and then the technical characteristics of the fishing operation (number of hooks and fishing during non-working days). Our conclusion is clear, because seabirds are more likely to approach longline vessels when trawlers are not allowed to operate (i.e. non-working days), activity of longliners should be limited to working days, and closing longliners activity during the month of October could reduce greatly reducing seabird bycatch. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","10.1007/s10531-014-0625-6","Williams","Williams_290",251,0.217130342717437,0.121193408173972,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
291,2014,"Mitigating Seabird Bycatch during Hauling by Pelagic Longline Vessels","PLoS ONE","Bycatch in longline fisheries threatens the viability of some seabird populations. The Hawaii longline swordfish fishery reduced seabird captures by an order of magnitude primarily through mitigating bycatch during setting. Now, 75% of captures occur during hauling. We fit observer data to a generalized additive regression model with mixed effects to determine the significance of the effect of various factors on the standardized seabird haul catch rate. Density of albatrosses attending vessels during hauling, leader length and year had largest model effects. The standardized haul catch rate significantly increased with increased albatross density during hauling. The standardized catch rate was significantly higher the longer the leader: shorter leaders place weighted swivels closer to hooks, reducing the likelihood of baited hooks becoming available to surface-scavenging albatrosses. There was a significant linear increasing temporal trend in the standardized catch rate, possibly partly due to an observed increasing temporal trend in the local abundance of albatrosses attending vessels during hauling. Swivel weight, Beaufort scale and season were also significant but smaller model effects. Most (81%) haul captures were on branchlines actively being retrieved. Future haul mitigation research should therefore focus on reducing bird access to hooks as crew coil branchlines, including methods identified here of shorter leaders and heavier swivels, and other potentially effective methods, including faster branchline coiling and shielding the area where hooks becomes accessible. The proportion of Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) captures that occurred during hauling was significantly, 1.6 times, higher than for black-footed albatrosses (P. nigripes), perhaps due to differences in the time of day of foraging and in daytime scavenging competitiveness; mitigating haul bycatch would therefore be a larger benefit to Laysans. Locally, findings identify opportunities to nearly eliminate seabird bycatch. Globally, findings fill a gap in knowledge of methods to mitigate seabird bycatch during pelagic longline hauling.","10.1371/journal.pone.0084499","Williams","Williams_291",299,0.205019638926162,0.208001678973846,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
292,2014,"Best practice seabird bycatch mitigation for pelagic longline fisheries targeting tuna and related species","Fisheries Research","We comprehensively tested combinations of three primary mitigation measures in a pelagic longline fishery with one of the highest rates of interaction with what may be the world's most challenging seabird assemblage (dominated by Procellaria genus petrels), aboard fishing vessels typical of the Asian distant water fleet. Multiple measures were used to compare the performance of weighted vs. unweighted branch lines set with two bird-scaring lines - hybrid lines with long and short streamers - during daytime and nighttime. The weights used were a novel double-weight configuration. Secondary attacks on baits brought to the surface by white-chinned petrels drove albatross mortality. Regardless of time of day, weighted branch lines with two bird-scaring lines, deployed and maintained with an aerial extent of 100. m, reduced bird attacks by a factor of four, and secondary attacks and seabird mortality by a factor of seven, compared to unweighted branch lines, with little effect on fish catch rates and with no injuries to crew. This combination yielded zero bird mortalities when gear was set at night. We conclude that the simultaneous use of two bird-scaring lines, weighted branch lines and night setting meet our criteria for best-practice seabird bycatch mitigation for the joint-venture fleet targeting tuna and related species in the South African EEZ. To be successful, the aerial extent of bird-scaring lines should be aligned with the distance astern that baited hooks sink beyond the foraging depth of the dominant seabird - in this case white-chinned petrels to a depth near 5. m. Given that these measures were successful in one of the most challenging pelagic longline fisheries, they are likely to be widely applicable to pelagic longline fisheries using similar gear. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.fishres.2013.07.012","Williams","Williams_292",286,0.101027376953871,-0.0222476548231413,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

The aim of this study was to examine the spatial and temporal variation in bycatch rates of these species, and to identify the contributing environmental and operational factors. We used data collected by observers on board pelagic longliners in the Uruguayan fleet in 2004-2011, and on Japanese vessels operating in Uruguay under an experimental fishing license in 2009-2011. Bycatch rates for northern and southern royal albatrosses were higher than expected based on previous reports, particularly over the shelf break. Wandering and Tristan albatrosses were caught predominantly in pelagic waters, where there are numerous fishing fleets from other flag states. Bycatch of great albatrosses was highest in April-November, with the peak for royal albatrosses in June-July, and for wandering and Tristan albatrosses in September-November.

294,2014,"Comparing bycatch mitigation strategies for vulnerable marine megafauna","Animal Conservation","Marine megafauna such as seabirds, marine mammals and sea turtles are subject to high mortality from incidental capture or bycatch in fisheries. Recent research suggests that fishing effort is increasing worldwide, highlighting the need to evaluate strategies intended to reduce marine megafauna bycatch. Here, we use three focal species (i.e. leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea, black-footed albatross Phoebastria nigripes and vaquita porpoise Phocoena sinus) as case studies to compare management outcomes of four bycatch mitigation measures: time-area closures, individual bycatch limits, gear modifications and buy-outs. Time-area closures were used for leatherbacks and vaquitas with limited effectiveness, although timing, size and enforcement influenced their efficacy. Individual bycatch limits were employed for leatherbacks in one fishery, sometimes simultaneously with gear modifications and closures. Gear modifications consistently reduced bycatch of leatherbacks and black-footed albatross and showed strong promise for vaquitas. True buy-outs were only used for vaquitas and were costly, most fishers were unwilling to be bought out, and it is unclear if they reduced bycatch. Our review suggests that gear modifications were the most widely used and generally most promising technique for these species, although management outcomes of each strategy depended largely on the species-fishery interaction, fishery characteristics and socioeconomic context. Based on lessons learned from our case studies, we outline when and where a particular approach may be most effective, provide recommendations for improving each strategy and highlight priorities for future research. © 2013 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/acv.12051","Williams","Williams_294",243,0.397206046153978,0.0731502589661173,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Fisheries can impact large predator abundance directly through targeted capture and indirectly through incidental capture of nontarget species or bycatch. However, measures of the global nature of bycatch are lacking for air-breathing megafauna. We fill this knowledge gap and present a synoptic global assessment of the distribution and intensity of bycatch of seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles based on empirical data from the three most commonly used types of fishing gears worldwide. We identify taxa-specific hotspots of bycatch intensity and find evidence of cumulative impacts across fishing fleets and gears. This global map of bycatch illustrates where data are particularly scarce-in coastal and small-scale fisheries and ocean regions that support developed industrial fisheries and millions of small-scale fishers-and identifies fishing areas where, given the evidence of cumulative hotspots across gear and taxa, traditional species or gear-specific bycatch management and mitigation efforts may be necessary but not sufficient. Given the global distribution of bycatch and the mitigation success achieved by some fleets, the reduction of air-breathing megafauna bycatch is both an urgent and achievable conservation priority.","10.1073/pnas.1318960111","Williams","Williams_295",202,0.237486009840826,0.0903728325943582,"250","neutral","neutral_250",1

In this study we used remote sensing techniques to model the degree of spatial overlapping between the Black-browed albatross ( Thalassarche melanophris) and Argentine fisheries, assuming this as a proxy of risk for albatrosses. Eleven tags were deployed on albatrosses during the non-breeding seasons 2011 and 2012 in the Patagonian Shelf. Their distribution overlapped to different extents with the two coastal trawl, three offshore trawl and one demersal longline fisheries. The overlap index showed highest values with both coastal fleets, followed by the ice-chilling trawl fleet. These intersections were located in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone, in coastal areas of the SE of Buenos Aires province, El Rincón estuary and over the shelf break. The analysis of intersections of focal areas from albatrosses and all fisheries allowed the identification of thirty-four fishing management units (1° by 1° grid within the Argentine EEZ) classified as of medium, high or very high conservation priority. Very high priority units were placed between 35 and 38°S in the external mouth of Rio de la Plata, and between 45 and 47°S in neighboring waters East to the hake fishing closure. Although there were possible biases due to the limited number of tracked birds and the locations where albatrosses were captured and instrumented, the information presented in this study provides a comprehensive picture of important areas of overlapping during winter that could be used by the fishery administration to prioritize conservation actions under limited resource scenarios. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.seares.2014.02.006","Williams","Williams_296",255,0.328708894764723,0.0727739112632948,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

To evaluate the effectiveness of the ban we undertook surveys of > 250 veterinary and general pharmacies in 11 Indian states from November 2007 to June 2010. Twelve different classes of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were purchased from 176 pharmacies. Other than meloxicam (of negligible toxicity to vultures at likely concentrations in their food), diclofenac and ketoprofen (both toxic to vultures), little is known of the safety or toxicity of the remaining nine NSAIDs on sale. Meloxicam was the most commonly encountered drug, sold in 70% of pharmacies, but 50% of the meloxicam brands sold had paracetamol (acetaminophen) as a second ingredient. Diclofenac and ketoprofen were recorded in 36 and 29% of pharmacies, respectively, with states in western and central India having the highest prevalence of diclofenac (44-45%). Although the large number of manufacturers and availability of meloxicam is encouraging, the wide range of untested NSAIDs and continued availability of diclofenac is a major source of concern. Circumvention of the 2006 diclofenac ban is being achieved by illegally selling forms of diclofenac manufactured for human use for veterinary purposes.

The governments of India, Pakistan and Nepal took action in 2006 to prevent the veterinary use of diclofenac on domesticated livestock, the route by which contamination occurs. We analyse data from three surveys of the prevalence and concentration of diclofenac residues in carcasses of domesticated ungulates in India, carried out before and after the implementation of a ban on veterinary use. There was little change in the prevalence and concentration of diclofenac between a survey before the ban and one conducted soon after its implementation, with the percentage of carcasses containing diclofenac in these surveys estimated at 10.8 and 10.7%, respectively. However, both the prevalence and concentration of diclofenac had fallen markedly 7-31 months after the implementation of the ban, with the true prevalence in this third survey estimated at 6.5%. Modelling of the impact of this reduction in diclofenac on the expected rate of decline of the oriental white-backed vulture (Gyps bengalensis) in India indicates that the decline rate has decreased to 40% of the rate before the ban, but is still likely to be rapid (about 18% year-1).

Populations of all three species of vulture remained at a low level, but the decline had slowed and may even have reversed for G. bengalensis, both in India and Nepal. However, estimates of the most recent population trends are imprecise, so it is possible that declines may be continuing, though at a significantly slower rate. The degree to which the decline of G. bengalensis in India has slowed is consistent with the expected effects on population trend of a measured change in the level of contamination of ungulate carcasses with the drug diclofenac, which is toxic to vultures, following a ban on its veterinary use in 2006.

Population sizes of each species are estimated at 50-200+ individuals, ranging across an area of approximately 300 km by 250 km, including adjacent areas in Laos and Vietnam. The principal causes of vulture mortality were poisoning (73%), probably as an accidental consequence of local hunting and fishing practices, and hunting or capture for traditional medicine (15%). This represents a significant loss from such a small population of long-lived, slow breeding, species such as vultures. Cambodian vultures are severely food limited and are primarily dependent on domestic ungulate carcasses, as wild ungulate populations have been severely depleted over the past 20 years. Local people across the vulture range still follow traditional animal husbandry practices, including releasing livestock into the open deciduous dipterocarp forest areas when they are not needed for work, providing the food source. Reducing threats through limiting the use of poisons (which are also harmful for human health) and supplementary food provisioning in the short to medium-term through 'vulture restaurants' is critical if Cambodian vultures are to be conserved.

The birds died when they fed on carrion from treated animals. Veterinary diclofenac was banned in 2006 and meloxicam was advocated as a vulture-safe alternative. We examine the effectiveness of the 2006 ban, whether meloxicam has replaced diclofenac, and the impact of these changes on vultures. Drug residue data from liver samples collected from ungulate carcasses in India since 2004 demonstrate that the prevalence of diclofenac in carcasses in 2009 was half of that before the ban and meloxicam prevalence increased by 44%. The expected vulture death rate from diclofenac per meal in 2009 was one-third of that before the ban. Surveys at veterinary clinics show that diclofenac use in India began in 1994, coinciding with the onset of rapid Gyps declines ascertained from measured rates of declines. Our study shows that one pharmaceutical product has had a devastating impact on Asias vultures. Large-scale research and survey were needed to detect, diagnose and quantify the problem and measure the response to remedial actions.

364,2014,"Management implications of genetic studies for ex situ populations of three critically endangered Asian Gyps vultures","Animal Conservation","Captive breeding and ex situ conservation have become important tools in species conservation programmes. The effectiveness of the management of captive populations can be hampered by the absence of pedigree data, but molecular markers can be used to inform conservation objectives and reduce inbreeding in the captive population. Using microsatellite markers, we examined the genetic diversity and relatedness among wild-caught individuals of three critically endangered Asian vulture species, Gyps bengalensis, Gypsindicus and Gypstenuirostris, populations established for captive breeding. Estimates of the inbreeding coefficient (f) were low, indicating that populations of all three species do not appear to be inbred. Moreover, the data show that a large proportion of wild-taken birds were unrelated individuals (94.6, 87.1 and 85.3% in G.bengalensis, G.indicus and G.tenuirostris, respectively). No significant genetic differentiation (FST) was observed between historic and 2000/2001 populations of G.bengalensis in Pakistan and India. However, the more recent sampling (2002-2006) in Pakistan showed a significant difference from India. A genetic signal of a demographic bottleneck in all three species was found in some (M-ratio test), but not all, tests (heterozygote excess and mode shift in allele frequencies). Levels of genetic diversity in G.bengalensis and G.indicus populations were comparable to levels prior to or soon after the start of their decline, respectively, suggesting that adequate numbers of birds exist in captivity for these two species and reflect neutral diversity levels observed in the wild. The genetic data obtained from this study allow us to minimize the loss of neutral genetic diversity in small wild and captive populations and to identify related pairs to avoid inbreeding depression.","10.1111/acv.12166","Williams","Williams_364",266,0.22501725494919,0.00554924813639497,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Vultures died after feeding on carcasses of recently-medicated animals. The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan banned the veterinary use of diclofenac in 2006. We analysed results of 62 necropsies and 48 NSAID assays of liver and/or kidney for vultures of five species found dead in India between 2000 and 2012. Visceral gout and diclofenac were detected in vultures from nine states and three species: Gyps bengalensis, Gyps indicus and Gyps himalayensis. Visceral gout was found in every vulture carcass in which a measurable level of diclofenac was detected. Meloxicam, an NSAID of low toxicity to vultures, was found in two vultures and nimesulide in five vultures. Nimesulide at elevated tissue concentrations was associated with visceral gout in four of these cases, always without diclofenac, suggesting that nimesulide may have similar toxic effects to those of diclofenac. Residues of meloxicam on its own were never associated with visceral gout. The proportion of Gyps vultures found dead in the wild in India with measurable levels of diclofenac in their tissues showed a modest and non-significant decline since the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac. The prevalence of visceral gout declined less, probably because some cases of visceral gout from 2008 onwards were associated with nimesulide rather than diclofenac. Veterinary use of nimesulide is a potential threat to the recovery of vulture populations.","10.1017/S003060531500037X","Williams","Williams_369",242,0.239988452476422,-0.201176758510428,"250","negative","negative_250",0

The manufacture of veterinary formulations of diclofenac has since been banned across the region with mixed success. However, at least 12 other NSAIDs are available for veterinary use in South Asia. Aceclofenac is one of these compounds, and it is known to metabolize into diclofenac in some mammal species. The metabolic pathway of aceclofenac in cattle, the primary food of vultures in South Asia, is unknown. We gave 6 cattle the recommended dose of aceclofenac (2 mg/kg), collected blood thereafter at intervals for up to 12 h, and used liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry in a pharmacokinetic analysis of aceclofenac and diclofenac in the plasma. Nearly all the aceclofenac administered to the cattle was very rapidly metabolized into diclofenac. At 2 h, half the aceclofenac had been converted into diclofenac, and at 12 h four-fifths of the aceclofenac had been converted into diclofenac. Therefore, administering aceclofenac to livestock poses the same risk to vultures as administering diclofenac to livestock. This, coupled with the risk that aceclofenac may replace diclofenac in the veterinary market, points to the need for an immediate ban on all aceclofenac formulations that can be used to treat livestock. Without such a ban, the recovery of vultures across South Asia will not be successful.","10.1111/cobi.12711","Williams","Williams_372",232,0.343252005381811,-0.169194044215633,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

This paper reports results from the latest in a series of road transect surveys conducted across northern, central, western and north-eastern India since the early 1990s. Results from the seven comparable surveys now available were analysed to estimate recent population trends. Populations of all three species of vulture remained at a low level. The previously rapid decline of White-rumped Vulture has slowed and may have reversed since the ban on veterinary use of diclofenac in India in 2006. A few thousand of this species, possibly up to the low tens of thousands, remained in India in 2015. The population of Indian Vulture continued to decline, though probably at a much slower rate than in the 1990s.

Not surprisingly, concern has been raised over other similar drugs. In this study, we evaluate the toxicity of carprofen to the Gyps vulture clade through plasma pharmacokinetics evaluations in Bos taurus cattle (their food source) and Gyps africanus (a validated model species); tissue residues in cattle; and the effect of carprofen as a secondary toxicant as both tissue-bound residue or pure drug at levels expected in cattle tissues. Carprofen residues were highest in cattle kidney (7.72 ± 2.38 mg/kg) and injection site muscle (289.05 ± 98.96 mg/kg of dimension of 5 × 5 × 5 cm). Vultures exposed to carprofen as residues in the kidney tissue or pure drug equivalents showed no toxic signs. When exposed to average injection site concentrations (64 mg/kg) one of two birds died with evidence of severe renal and liver damage. Toxicokinetic analysis revealed a prolonged drug half-life of 37.75 h in the dead bird as opposed to 13.99 ± 5.61 h from healthy birds dosed intravenously at 5 mg/kg. While carprofen may generally be harmless to Gyps vultures, its high levels at the injection site in treated cattle can result in lethal exposure in foraging vultures, due to relative small area of tissue it is found therein. We thus suggest that carprofen not be used in domesticated ungulates in areas where carcasses are accessible or provided to vultures at supplementary feeding sites.","10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.08.167","Williams","Williams_378",250,0.269620574051789,-0.0664517025612282,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
496,2011,"Decision Analysis for Conservation Breeding: Maximizing Production for Reintroduction of Whooping Cranes","Journal of Wildlife Management","Captive breeding is key to management of severely endangered species, but maximizing captive production can be challenging because of poor knowledge of species breeding biology and the complexity of evaluating different management options. In the face of uncertainty and complexity, decision-analytic approaches can be used to identify optimal management options for maximizing captive production. Building decision-analytic models requires iterations of model conception, data analysis, model building and evaluation, identification of remaining uncertainty, further research and monitoring to reduce uncertainty, and integration of new data into the model. We initiated such a process to maximize captive production of the whooping crane (Grus americana), the world's most endangered crane, which is managed through captive breeding and reintroduction. We collected 15 years of captive breeding data from 3 institutions and used Bayesian analysis and model selection to identify predictors of whooping crane hatching success. The strongest predictor, and that with clear management relevance, was incubation environment. The incubation period of whooping crane eggs is split across two environments: crane nests and artificial incubators. Although artificial incubators are useful for allowing breeding pairs to produce multiple clutches, our results indicate that crane incubation is most effective at promoting hatching success. Hatching probability increased the longer an egg spent in a crane nest, from 40% hatching probability for eggs receiving 1 day of crane incubation to 95% for those receiving 30 days (time incubated in each environment varied independently of total incubation period). Because birds will lay fewer eggs when they are incubating longer, a tradeoff exists between the number of clutches produced and egg hatching probability. We developed a decision-analytic model that estimated 16 to be the optimal number of days of crane incubation needed to maximize the number of offspring produced. These results show that using decision-analytic tools to account for uncertainty in captive breeding can improve the rate at which such programs contribute to wildlife reintroductions. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.88","Williams","Williams_496",314,0.383156241752308,0.131085379073907,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
500,2012,"River inflow, estuarine salinity, and Carolina wolfberry fruit abundance: linking abiotic drivers to Whooping Crane food","Journal of Coastal Conservation","The supply of freshwater to estuarine ecosystems is a critical factor in maintaining the overall health and organization of coastal marshes. Specifically along the Texas Gulf coast, the coupled effects of decreased freshwater inflows to the estuary and natural processes (e. g., precipitation, wind, and tides) can exert significant salt-stress on coastal marsh vegetation. In this project we sought to quantitatively link the inflow of freshwater to the estuary (San Antonio Bay) with Aransas National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) coastal marsh salinity and assess the influence of salinity and inundation on Carolina wolfberry (Lycium carolinianum Walt.) phenology (leaf and fruit abundance). The Carolina wolfberry is one of the more common high marsh plant species found at ANWR and has been shown to be a key food source for endangered Whooping Cranes which inhabit the coastal marshes of the ANWR each fall/winter. Results from our study show that periods of decreased freshwater inflows to the estuary correlated with increased marsh salinity at the ANWR. Wolfberry plants at ANWR marsh sites displayed increased fruit abundance during years which had lower mean summer time salinity (June, July, and August) in San Antonio Bay; conversely, during years of increased bay salinity during the same summertime months, wolfberry plants showed decreased fruit abundance. Through the continued validation of the relationship between inflows and coastal marsh salinity, we hope to provide additional insight into how wolfberry phenology varies inter-annually across both salinity and inundation regimes and how freshwater inflows may affect food availability for the endangered Whooping Crane. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s11852-012-0205-4","Williams","Williams_500",260,0.137847569355049,0.127900784559789,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

We describe a method that integrates correlates of persistence for multiple species into a single currency - site quality. Site quality is, in turn, an explicit measure of performance used in optimization. We develop a Bayesian network to assess site quality, which assigns an expected value to a property based on criteria arrayed into a causal diagram. We then use stochastic dynamic programming to determine whether an organization should acquire or reject a site placed on the public market. Our framework for assessing sites and making land acquisition decisions represents a compromise between the use of generic spatial design criteria and more intensive computational tools, like spatially-explicit population models. There is certainly a loss of precision by using site quality as a surrogate for more direct measures of persistence. However, we believe this simplification is defensible when sufficient data, expertise, or other resources are lacking. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2012.03.014","Williams","Williams_501",166,0.164291659934781,0.259480966055526,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
502,2012,"Archive Eggs: A Research and Management Tool for Avian Conservation Breeding","Wildlife Society Bulletin","Worldwide, approximately 168 bird species are captive-bred for reintroduction into the wild. Programs tend to be initiated for species with a high level of endangerment. Depressed hatching success can be a problem for such programs and has been linked to artificial incubation. The need for artificial incubation is driven by the practice of multiclutching to increase egg production or by uncertainty over the incubation abilities of captive birds. There has been little attempt to determine how artificial incubation differs from bird-contact incubation. We describe a novel archive (data-logger) egg and use it to compare temperature, humidity, and egg-turning in 5 whooping crane (Grus americana) nests, 4 sandhill crane (G. canadensis) nests, and 3 models of artificial incubator; each of which are used to incubate eggs in whooping crane captivebreeding programs. Mean incubation temperature was 31.78 °C for whooping cranes and 32.838 °C for sandhill cranes. This is well below that of the artificial incubators (which were set based on a protocol of 37.68 °C). Humidity in crane nests varied considerably, but median humidity in all 3 artificial incubators was substantially different from that in the crane nests. Two artificial incubators failed to turn the eggs in a way that mimicked crane egg-turning. Archive eggs are an effective tool for guiding the management of avian conservation breeding programs, and can be custom-made for other species.

503,2012,"Evaluating release alternatives for a long-lived bird species under uncertainty about long-term demographic rates","Journal of Ornithology","The release of animals to reestablish an extirpated population is a decision problem that is often attended by considerable uncertainty about the probability of success. Annual releases of captive-reared juvenile Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) were begun in 1993 in central Florida, USA, to establish a breeding, non-migratory population. Over a 12-year period, 286 birds were released, but by 2004, the introduced flock had produced only four wild-fledged birds. Consequently, releases were halted over managers' concerns about the performance of the released flock and uncertainty about the efficacy of further releases. We used data on marked, released birds to develop predictive models for addressing whether releases should be resumed, and if so, under what schedule. To examine the outcome of different release scenarios, we simulated the survival and productivity of individual female birds under a baseline model that recognized age and breeding-class structure and which incorporated empirically estimated stochastic elements. As data on wild-fledged birds from captive-reared parents were sparse, a key uncertainty that confronts release decision-making is whether captive-reared birds and their offspring share the same vital rates. Therefore, we used data on the only population of wild Whooping Cranes in existence to construct two alternatives to the baseline model. The probability of population persistence was highly sensitive to the choice of these three models. Under the baseline model, extirpation of the population was nearly certain under any scenario of resumed releases. In contrast, the model based on estimates from wild birds projected a high probability of persistence under any release scenario, including cessation of releases. Therefore, belief in either of these models suggests that further releases are an ineffective use of resources. In the third model, which simulated a population Allee effect, population persistence was sensitive to the release decision: high persistence probability was achieved only through the release of more birds, whereas extirpation was highly probable with cessation of releases. Despite substantial investment of time and effort in the release program, evidence collected to date does not favor one model over another; therefore, any decision about further releases must be made under considerable biological uncertainty. However, given an assignment of credibility weight to each model, a best, informed decision about releases can be made under uncertainty. Furthermore, if managers can periodically revisit the release decision and collect monitoring data to further inform the models, then managers have a basis for confronting uncertainty and adaptively managing releases through time. © 2010 Dt.

504,2012,"Potential Impact of Climate Change Scenarios on Whooping Crane Life History","Wetlands","Whooping crane (Grus americana), a rare and critically endangered species, are wetland dependent throughout their life cycle. The whooping crane's small population size, limited distribution, and wetland habitat requirements make them vulnerable to potential climate changes. Climate change predictions suggest overall temperature increases and significant changes in precipitation regimes throughout North America. At the individual level, temperature changes should have neutral to positive effects on thermoregulation and overall energy expenditure throughout the whooping crane's range. In the breeding grounds, earlier snow melt and increasing temperatures should improve food resources. However, increased precipitation and more extreme rainfall events could impact chick survival if rainfall occurs during hatching. Increased precipitation may also alter fire regimes leading to increased woody plant abundance thus reducing nesting habitat quality. During winter, higher temperatures will lead to a northward shifting of the freeze line, which will decrease habitat quality via invasion of black mangrove. Large portions of current winter habitat may be lost if predicted sea level changes occur. Stopover wetland availability during migration may decrease due to drier conditions in the Great Plains. Current and future conservation actions should be planned in light of not only current needs but also considering future expectations. © Society of Wetland Scientists 2011.","10.1007/s13157-011-0250-z","Williams","Williams_504",202,0.238583173382425,0.148813541104795,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
505,2012,"Demography and population trends of Whooping Cranes","Journal of Field Ornithology","Previous studies of Whooping Crane demography used estimates of fecundity rates based on females in captivity, and breeding success was estimated based on either the number of unbanded pairs nesting or the number arriving in wintering areas with chicks. We analyzed demographic data from 12 cohorts of banded Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) from the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge/Wood Buffalo National Park (ANWR/WBNP) population that had not been compiled previously into a single data base and had not been included in previous population analyses. We estimated age-specific survival and natality, parameterized an age-structured density-dependent model, and projected population sizes assuming two different estimates of wintering ground carrying capacity. Sixty-seven of 132 birds banded between 1977 and 1988 formed nesting pairs, females first produced hatchlings when 3 to 7 yrs old, and the annual proportion of mature females that reproduced successfully ranged from 0.566 to 0.606. Population projections indicate that the down-listing criterion of reaching a population size of 1000 individuals might be attained considerably later than the target year (2035) indicated in the Whooping Crane recovery plan. Even assuming that all suitable habitat within a ~100-km radius of their current winter range could be occupied, projections suggest that population size may be ~700 in 2035, and might not reach 1000 individuals until the mid-2060s. Based on their territorial behavior on the wintering grounds, long generation time and faithfulness to their migratory route, we suspect that the population growth rate may decrease markedly in the near future and the ANWR/WBNP population may remain below the target down-listing size of 1000 individuals. © 2012 The Authors.

Decisions to reduce the potential for inbreeding depression by balancing genotypic contributions to reintroduced populations may exact a cost on long-term demographic performance of the population if those decisions result in reduced numbers of animals released and/or restriction of particularly successful genotypes (i. e., heritable traits of particular family lines). As part of an effort to restore a migratory flock of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) to eastern North America using the offspring of captive breeders, we obtained a unique dataset which includes post-release mark-recapture data, as well as the pedigree of each released individual. We developed a Bayesian formulation of a multi-state model to analyze radio-telemetry, band-resight, and dead recovery data on reintroduced individuals, in order to track survival and breeding state transitions. We used studbook-based individual covariates to examine the comparative evidence for and degree of effects of inbreeding, genotype, and genotype quality on post-release survival of reintroduced individuals. We demonstrate implementation of the Bayesian multi-state model, which allows for the integration of imperfect detection, multiple data types, random effects, and individual- and time-dependent covariates. Our results provide only weak evidence for an effect of the quality of an individual's genotype in captivity on post-release survival as well as for an effect of inbreeding on post-release survival.

508,2013,"Whooping crane Grus americana chick mortality and management intervention","Wildlife Biology","Translocation of captive-reared animals is widely used as a tool for endangered species recovery. Frequently, translocated populations have relatively low initial productivity, requiring management intervention. A translocated population of whooping cranes Grus americana in central Wisconsin is such a case. We examined chick mortality for this population and used daily chick survival rates as our response variable to model several parameters including phenology, chick age, energetics and parent age and experience. We also developed and evaluated adoption techniques using sandhill cranes Grus canadensis to mitigate the effects of high chick mortality and increase the probability of fledging. Our results illustrate the challenges that translocated populations can face as they encounter novel breeding conditions. We found that whooping crane daily chick survival was relatively low and most mortality events occurred within the first 20 days. Our results indicated that variables related to age of the parents as well as the pair's previous chick rearing experience were useful for predicting daily chick survival. We found that sandhill crane foster parents readily accepted replacement chicks. We also demonstrated adopted chicks acceptance of foster parents and that the chicks' source (captive-born vs wild-born) did not affect success of the adoption. Chick adoption provides several management options that could be used to bypass the period when chicks experience the greatest mortality. Reducing chick mortality and developing techniques to increase the number of fledged chicks is paramount for whooping crane recovery as well as the recovery of other endangered bird species. © Wildlife Biology, NKV.","10.2981/12-133","Williams","Williams_508",250,0.218569525557721,0.140643062959986,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
509,2013,"Avian mortalities due to transmission line collisions: a review of current estimates and field methods with an emphasis on applications to the Canadian electric network","Avian Conservation and Ecology","Birds are vulnerable to collisions with human-made fixed structures. Despite ongoing development and increases in infrastructure, we have few estimates of the magnitude of collision mortality. We reviewed the existing literature on avian mortality associated with transmission lines and derived an initial estimate for Canada. Estimating mortality from collisions with power lines is challenging due to the lack of studies, especially from sites within Canada, and due to uncertainty about the magnitude of detection biases. Detection of bird collisions with transmission lines varies due to habitat type, species size, and scavenging rates. In addition, birds can be crippled by the impact and subsequently die, although crippling rates are poorly known and rarely incorporated into estimates. We used existing data to derive a range of estimates of avian mortality associated with collisions with transmission lines in Canada by incorporating detection, scavenging, and crippling biases. There are 231,966 km of transmission lines across Canada, mostly in the boreal forest. Mortality estimates ranged from 1 million to 229.5 million birds per year, depending on the bias corrections applied. We consider our most realistic estimate, taking into account variation in risk across Canada, to range from 2.5 million to 25.6 million birds killed per year. Data from multiple studies across Canada and the northern U.S. indicate that the most vulnerable bird groups are (1) waterfowl, (2) grebes, (3) shorebirds, and (4) cranes, which is consistent with other studies. Populations of several groups that are vulnerable to collisions are increasing across Canada (e.g., waterfowl, raptors), which suggests that collision mortality, at current levels, is not limiting population growth. However, there may be impacts on other declining species, such as shorebirds and some species at risk, including Alberta's Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) and western Canada's endangered Whooping Cranes (Grus americana). Collisions may be more common during migration, which underscores the need to understand impacts across the annual cycle. We emphasize that these estimates are preliminary, especially considering the absence of Canadian studies. © 2013 by the author(s).","10.5751/ACE-00614-080207","Williams","Williams_509",324,0.331395627188279,-0.240930373942464,"350","negative","negative_350",1

Musculoskeletal disorders were described in 57 birds (90%); five birds were removed from the project prior to release (8%), all for abnormalities that prevented normal function. Fourteen birds died or were euthanized prior to release (22%); pre-release mortality was attributed to developmental abnormality, predation, trauma or infectious disease. Chronic respiratory aspergillosis, diagnosed in seven birds (11%), was the most common infectious disease of concern. Predation and trauma were primary causes of post-release mortality; no evidence of infectious disease of captive origin was detected in the study population by the end of 2010. The assessment of data accumulated by this project helped to outline successful health management strategies, as well as identify and mitigate ongoing risks to captive whooping cranes that impede reintroduction efforts and achieving management goals for species recovery. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","10.1002/zoo.21097","Williams","Williams_511",215,0.541639497092533,-0.0849783467751754,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
512,2013,"A hierarchical nest survival model integrating incomplete temporally varying covariates","Ecology and Evolution","Nest success is a critical determinant of the dynamics of avian populations, and nest survival modeling has played a key role in advancing avian ecology and management. Beginning with the development of daily nest survival models, and proceeding through subsequent extensions, the capacity for modeling the effects of hypothesized factors on nest survival has expanded greatly. We extend nest survival models further by introducing an approach to deal with incompletely observed, temporally varying covariates using a hierarchical model. Hierarchical modeling offers a way to separate process and observational components of demographic models to obtain estimates of the parameters of primary interest, and to evaluate structural effects of ecological and management interest. We built a hierarchical model for daily nest survival to analyze nest data from reintroduced whooping cranes (Grus americana) in the Eastern Migratory Population. This reintroduction effort has been beset by poor reproduction, apparently due primarily to nest abandonment by breeding birds. We used the model to assess support for the hypothesis that nest abandonment is caused by harassment from biting insects. We obtained indices of blood-feeding insect populations based on the spatially interpolated counts of insects captured in carbon dioxide traps. However, insect trapping was not conducted daily, and so we had incomplete information on a temporally variable covariate of interest. We therefore supplemented our nest survival model with a parallel model for estimating the values of the missing insect covariates. We used Bayesian model selection to identify the best predictors of daily nest survival. Our results suggest that the black fly Simulium annulus may be negatively affecting nest survival of reintroduced whooping cranes, with decreasing nest survival as abundance of S. annulus increases. The modeling framework we have developed will be applied in the future to a larger data set to evaluate the biting-insect hypothesis and other hypotheses for nesting failure in this reintroduced population; resulting inferences will support ongoing efforts to manage this population via an adaptive management approach. Wider application of our approach offers promise for modeling the effects of other temporally varying, but imperfectly observed covariates on nest survival, including the possibility of modeling temporally varying covariates collected from incubating adults. © 2013 The Authors.

515,2013,"A Matter of Tradeoffs: Reintroduction as a Multiple Objective Decision","Journal of Wildlife Management","Decision making in guidance of reintroduction efforts is made challenging by the substantial scientific uncertainty typically involved. However, a less recognized challenge is that the management objectives are often numerous and complex. Decision makers managing reintroduction efforts are often concerned with more than just how to maximize the probability of reintroduction success from a population perspective. Decision makers are also weighing other concerns such as budget limitations, public support and/or opposition, impacts on the ecosystem, and the need to consider not just a single reintroduction effort, but conservation of the entire species. Multiple objective decision analysis is a powerful tool for formal analysis of such complex decisions. We demonstrate the use of multiple objective decision analysis in the case of the Florida non-migratory whooping crane reintroduction effort. In this case, the State of Florida was considering whether to resume releases of captive-reared crane chicks into the non-migratory whooping crane population in that state. Management objectives under consideration included maximizing the probability of successful population establishment, minimizing costs, maximizing public relations benefits, maximizing the number of birds available for alternative reintroduction efforts, and maximizing learning about the demographic patterns of reintroduced whooping cranes. The State of Florida engaged in a collaborative process with their management partners, first, to evaluate and characterize important uncertainties about system behavior, and next, to formally evaluate the tradeoffs between objectives using the Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART). The recommendation resulting from this process, to continue releases of cranes at a moderate intensity, was adopted by the State of Florida in late 2008. Although continued releases did not receive support from the International Whooping Crane Recovery Team, this approach does provide a template for the formal, transparent consideration of multiple, potentially competing, objectives in reintroduction decision making. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.472","Williams","Williams_515",297,0.239301925678598,0.179523319595343,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
516,2013,"Influence of whooping crane population dynamics on its recovery and management","Biological Conservation","Wildlife populations experience periods of negative growth of varying magnitudes and duration. Understanding these dynamics and a population's sensitivity to them informs conservation planning, policy decisions, recovery criteria and management triggers, especially when management actions are expensive or risky. Therefore, to inform management and conservation of the only wild, migratory population of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana), we modeled its 73-year time-series of abundances and simulated future growth using Monte Carlo forecasting. We estimated the probability of the population reaching downlisting criteria. We used Monte Carlo simulation to examine this population's sensitivity to periods of negative growth (i.e., annual growth rate (r) = -0.025, -0.050, -0.100, or -0.150 for 1-3 consecutive years). We found this population exhibiting periodic declines on a 10-year cycle. We show it is unlikely to go extinct assuming conditions remain similar to the past. Our forecasts suggested the population will contain >400 birds by 2025. We found =3 consecutive years of r= -0.1 or =2 consecutive years of r= -0.15 must occur to significantly reduce abundance from the current trajectory and delay recovery. Favorably, the probability of reaching 400 birds by 2040 was 0.892 for the worst scenario. Such a scenario has only occurred once in 73. years of monitoring. Our simulations provide managers and policy makers information for evaluating recovery timelines, while forecasts aid setting habitat conservation targets. By describing how the population responds to periods of negative growth (natural or manmade), we identify management triggers, while informing monitoring frequency. Furthermore, our analyses provide a framework for moving discussions away from short-term, reactive decisions such as supplemental feeding, aquaculture, or small-scale freshwater provisioning, to long-term conservation approaches. © 2013.","10.1016/j.biocon.2013.04.003","Williams","Williams_516",261,0.256136774160449,0.143548710598944,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
519,2013,"Effects of environmental stressors on nest success of introduced birds","Journal of Wildlife Management","Understanding the influence of environmental stressors on daily nest survival of introduced birds is important because it can affect introduction success as well as the ability to evaluate introduction programs. For long-lived birds with low annual production, adjustment to local breeding conditions can take many years. We examined nest success rates of 2 introduced bird species, whooping crane (Grus americana) and trumpeter swan (Cygnus buccinator), in Wisconsin. Both species are long-lived with low annual reproductive rates. Trumpeter swans were established in our study area approximately 10 years before whooping cranes. We predicted that trumpeter swans would show less sensitivity to environmental stressors. We used daily nest survival rates (DNSRs) as our response variable to model several environmental parameters including weather, phenology, and ornithophilic black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae). Additionally, we examined the influence of captive history, age, release method, energetics, and nesting experience on whooping crane DNSRs. Daily nest survival of whooping cranes was the most sensitive to stressors. Trumpeter swan daily nest survival showed less sensitivity to the same stressors. Daily nest survival for both species peaked later in the nesting season, after 30 April and before 30 May. We also found that the daily nest survival rate (DNSR) for whooping cranes was potentially affected by captive exposure (measured by generations removed from the wild). Our results highlight the difficulties associated with conservation of long-lived birds with low annual productivity as they adjust to local breeding conditions and that nest phenology at the source location can determine how these conditions are interfaced. We recommend that the juxtaposition of source and introduction location nest phenology be considered prior to introduction site selection. Additionally, strategically selecting offspring from captive pairs with nest phenology similar to that of sympatric species at the introduction location should be considered. Published 2013.

521,2014,"Winter Distribution Dynamics and Implications to a Reintroduced Population of Migratory Whooping Cranes","Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management","From 2001 to 2012, the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership released 196 costume-reared juvenile whooping cranes Grus americana in the eastern United States in an effort to reintroduce a migratory population of this endangered species. Techniques included leading juveniles from Wisconsin to wintering areas by ultralight aircraft or direct release of juveniles in Wisconsin prior to their first autumn migration. With few exceptions, ultralight-led cranes released on the Florida Gulf Coast wintered in inland freshwater habitats in subsequent winters. Wintering of the population occurred in four general regions: Florida-southern Georgia, coastal Carolina, the Mid-South (primarily Tennessee and northern Alabama), and the North (Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky). Releases of ultralight-led juveniles resulted in the majority of the population returning to winter in Florida during the early years of the reintroduction. Later direct autumn releases and shortstopping by ultralight-led birds increased numbers in the Mid-South. Winter climate played a large role in wintering in the North. Drought resulted in changes in wintering locations, especially in Florida. Other factors influencing changes in distribution included habitat degradation and associations with other whooping cranes, especially new mates and birds released by different techniques. Breeding pairs and direct autumn-released birds exhibited greater winter site fidelity than did nonbreeders or ultralight aircraft-led birds, but fidelity was low for all groups. Causes of mortality differed across the winter range, with predation being most prevalent in Florida and gunshot accounting for the majority of mortalities north of Florida. Because most pairing occurred in central Wisconsin, the widespread winter distribution had no apparent negative effect on pair formation. There was no clear relationship between winter region and subsequent incubation success. The widespread distribution of the population poses minimal risk to the outcome of the reintroduction in comparison to reproduction problems in the core reintroduction area of central Wisconsin.","10.3996/092012-JFWM-088","Williams","Williams_521",303,0.214535055622354,0.118847254539431,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
522,2014,"Whooping crane demographic responses to winter drought focus conservation strategies","Biological Conservation","Focusing conservation strategies requires identifying the demographic parameters and environmental conditions affecting the growth of animal populations most. Therefore, we examined relationships between population demographics and winter drought (1950-2011) for endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) wintering in Texas, USA. We modeled winter loss and its contribution to annual mortality as functions of winter drought, determined recruitment needed to maintain population growth after drought, and identified which demographic parameters underpin this population's growth. Previous research assumed winter loss (i.e., birds missed in subsequent surveys) represented mortality. We show that loss includes temporary emigration to upland habitats, early migration, and incomplete detection. Despite this, we maintained this assumption to evaluate the relevance of winter mortality to population growth. We found that winter loss (ß^=-0.308, SE = 0.042) and its contribution to annual mortality (ß^=-0.318, SE = 0.047) increased with drought severity (Palmer hydrological drought index; PHDI). Given average recruitment (0.145, SD = 0.090), this population increases 1.2% (95% CI = -2.9% to 4.2%) after extreme drought (PHDI = -4). No recruitment must occur for 3. years with moderate to severe drought (PHDI < -2.5) to delay species' recovery 7. years. This scenario has not occurred since population monitoring began in 1938. Of the demographic parameters we examined, winter loss explained population growth least (14.4%; 95% CI = 3.6-35.8%), and it was partially compensatory. Breeding-migratory mortality explained 42.2% (95% CI = 19.1-61.5%) of population growth and recruitment 49.9% (95% CI = 20.6-75.2%). Our results focus conservation on breeding and migratory periods, and deemphasize winter mortality and drought. On the wintering grounds, conservation of whooping cranes should emphasize maintaining coastal, upland, and interior habitats for this population.","10.1016/j.biocon.2014.08.021","Williams","Williams_522",243,0.234325159674094,-0.054272812615806,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
524,2014,"Refining Reintroduction of Whooping Cranes with Habitat Use and Suitability Analysis","Journal of Wildlife Management","A successful species reintroduction depends, in part, on the correct identification of suitable habitats. In cases where a species has been extirpated from a region for decades, however, this task is fraught with uncertainty. Uncertainty can be minimized and adjusted for by monitoring and adaptive management. The central goal of this study was to identify reintroduction sites that facilitate dispersion of whooping cranes (Grus americana), a federally listed endangered species, into optimal habitat as quickly as possible. First, we described the habitat selection of breeding home ranges for reintroduced whooping cranes in and around Necedah National Wildlife Refuge of central Wisconsin. We defined home ranges as 95% fixed spatial kernel density estimates from location data gathered from nesting whooping cranes from April through July 2005-2010. Whooping crane home ranges contained more emergent herbaceous wetlands than expected by chance and less developed or barren land, forest, and scrubland. Breeding whooping crane home ranges usually were composed of distinct nesting territories and off-territory elements; when moving off-territory, cranes decreased wetland selection and increased selection for open uplands. Second, we used habitat composition values and strength of selection (as determined by Jacob's index) to create a habitat suitability map to identify potential habitats that breeding whooping cranes could use in unoccupied eastern Wisconsin. With this method, we identified 2 large suitable wetland complexes within our study area associated with the Fox and Rock Rivers. Based on this analysis, the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership began releasing whooping cranes into White River Marsh State Wildlife Area and Horicon National Wildlife Refuge in 2011.","10.1002/jwmg.789","Williams","Williams_524",256,0.296743111063258,0.247901157648376,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
526,2014,"Demography of a reintroduced population: moving toward management models for an endangered species, the Whooping Crane","Ecological Applications","The reintroduction of threatened and endangered species is now a common method for reestablishing populations. Typically, a fundamental objective of reintroduction is to establish a self-sustaining population. Estimation of demographic parameters in reintroduced populations is critical, as these estimates serve multiple purposes. First, they support evaluation of progress toward the fundamental objective via construction of population viability analyses (PVAs) to predict metrics such as probability of persistence. Second, PVAs can be expanded to support evaluation of management actions, via management modeling. Third, the estimates themselves can support evaluation of the demographic performance of the reintroduced population (e.g., via comparison with wild populations). For each of these purposes, thorough treatment of uncertainties in the estimates is critical. Recently developed statistical methods (namely, hierarchical Bayesian implementations of state-space models) allow for effective integration of different types of uncertainty in estimation. We undertook a demographic estimation effort for a reintroduced population of endangered Whooping Cranes with the purpose of ultimately developing a Bayesian PVA for determining progress toward establishing a self-sustaining population, and for evaluating potential management actions via a Bayesian PVA-based management model. We evaluated individual and temporal variation in demographic parameters based upon a multi-state, mark-recapture model. We found that survival was relatively high across time and varied little by sex. There was some indication that survival varied by release method. Survival was similar to that observed in the wild population. Although overall reproduction in this reintroduced population is poor, birds formed social pairs when relatively young, and once a bird was in a social pair, it had a nearly 50% chance of nesting the following breeding season. Also, once a bird had nested, it had a high probability of nesting again. These results are encouraging, considering that survival and reproduction have been major challenges in past reintroductions of this species. The demographic estimates developed will support construction of a management model designed to facilitate exploration of management actions of interest, and will provide critical guidance in future planning for this reintroduction. An approach similar to what we describe could be usefully applied to many reintroduced populations. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/13-0559.1","Williams","Williams_526",358,0.242417022046604,0.155496688964286,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

We identified potential stopover habitats within an avian migratory flyway and demonstrated how this information can guide the site-selection process for new development. We used the random forests modeling approach to map the distribution of predicted stopover habitat for the Whooping Crane (Grus americana), an endangered species whose migratory flyway overlaps with an area where wind energy development is expected to become increasingly important. We then used this information to identify areas for potential wind power development in a U.S. state within the flyway (Nebraska) that minimize conflicts between Whooping Crane stopover habitat and the development of clean, renewable energy sources. Up to 54% of our study area was predicted to be unsuitable as Whooping Crane stopover habitat and could be considered relatively low risk for conflicts between Whooping Cranes and wind energy development. We suggest that this type of analysis be incorporated into the habitat conservation planning process in areas where incidental take permits are being considered for Whooping Cranes or other species of concern.

We used an iterative process of inductive analysis to examine structural and cognitive dimensions of social capital within the community. We observed networks with bonding ties within the community that are strengthened by active engagement in crane-related activities, shared values and community identity, and institutions that have fostered leadership and service. Bridging ties between community and state, federal, academic, and nonprofit organizations offer opportunities for knowledge sharing and legitimacy. Reciprocity and trust were evident from descriptions of the community working together effectively to address environmental and crane-related concerns. Challenges to successful community involvement include finding ways for meaningful community contributions to foster greater trust between the community and federal natural resource managers. We suggest social capital in this community provides a resource that has the potential to save time and money in addressing ongoing efforts to protect this charismatic endangered species.","10.1002/wsb.602","Williams","Williams_534",234,0.378034686938935,0.395022809842129,"250","neutral","neutral_250",1

Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) are one of the rarest birds in the world, and conservation and management of habitat is required to ensure their survival. We developed a species distribution model (SDM) that could be used to inform habitat management actions for Whooping Cranes within the state of Nebraska (U.S.A.). We collated 407 opportunistic Whooping Crane group records reported from 1988 to 2012. Most records of Whooping Cranes were contributed by the public; therefore, developing an SDM that accounted for sampling bias was essential because observations at some migration stopover locations may be under represented. An auxiliary data set, required to explore the influence of sampling bias, was derived with expert elicitation. Using our SDM, we compared an intensively managed area in the Central Platte River Valley with the Niobrara National Scenic River in northern Nebraska. Our results suggest, during the peak of migration, Whooping Crane abundance was 262.2 (90% CI 40.2-3144.2) times higher per unit area in the Central Platte River Valley relative to the Niobrara National Scenic River. Although we compared only 2 areas, our model could be used to evaluate any region within the state of Nebraska.

In May-September 2010, we interviewed 35 Texas individuals interested in crane conservation, and then analyzed transcripts using both a priori and emergent coding techniques. We found that active stakeholders were eager to work with wildlife managers because of the charismatic and economic values they attributed to the whooping crane. We also found that these stakeholders responded positively to agency intervention for the purpose of sharing expert knowledge and providing stakeholders with standing in the dynamically complex management practices surrounding the species and ecosystem.

Recently introduced, captively reared whooping cranes have had periods of poor reproductive performance in central Wisconsin that sometimes coincided with black fly (Diptera: Simuliidae) emergences. Sandhill crane Grus canadensis reproductive performance in central Wisconsin is approximately double that of whooping cranes. We used comfort behaviors as a measure of black fly harassment to infer whether behavioral differences existed between nesting sandhill cranes and nesting whooping cranes and between successful and unsuccessful whooping crane pairs. To further explore the interaction between black flies and incubating whooping cranes, we examined differences in behaviors between incubating birds and their off-nest mates. Compared to their off-nest mates, incubating whooping cranes exhibited elevated comfort behaviors, suggesting a bird at a nest may experience greater harassment from black flies. Sandhill cranes had elevated head-flicks over whooping cranes. Whooping cranes exhibited more headrubs than sandhill cranes, and successful whooping crane pairs had elevated head-rubs over pairs that deserted their nests. Behavioral differences between sandhill cranes and whooping cranes as well as differences in reproductive performance, could be explained by exposure to local breeding conditions. Whereas sandhill cranes have nested in the area for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, whooping cranes were only recently introduced to the area. Behavioral differences between the species as well as those between successful and unsuccessful whooping crane pairs could also be explained by the effect of captive exposure, which could affect all whooping crane introductions.","10.3996/042014-JFWM-032","Williams","Williams_540",259,0.125777048655904,0.221648319416336,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
542,2016,"Adaptive management for improving species conservation across the captive-wild spectrum","Biological Conservation","Conservation of endangered species increasingly envisages complex strategies that integrate captive and wild management actions. Management decisions in this context must be made in the face of uncertainty, often with limited capacity to collect information. Adaptive management (AM) combines management and monitoring, with the aim of updating knowledge and improving decision-making over time. We provide a guide for managers who may realize the potential of AM, but are unsure where to start. The urgent need for iterative management decisions, the existence of uncertainty, and the opportunity for learning offered by often highly-controlled captive environments create favorable conditions for AM. However, experiments and monitoring may be complicated by small sample sizes, and the ability to control the system, including stochasticity and observability, may be limited toward the wild end of the spectrum. We illustrate the key steps to implementing AM in threatened species management using four case studies, including the management of captive programs for cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and whooping cranes (Grus americana), of a translocation protocol for Arizona cliffroses Purshia subintegra and of ongoing supplementary feeding of reintroduced hihi (Notiomystis cincta) populations. For each case study, we explain (1) how to clarify whether the decision can be improved by learning (i.e. it is iterative and complicated by uncertainty) and what the management objectives are; (2) how to articulate uncertainty via alternative, testable hypotheses such as competing models or parameter distributions; (3) how to formally define how additional information can be collected and incorporated in future management decisions.","10.1016/j.biocon.2016.04.026","Williams","Williams_542",247,0.272075396184114,0.141642880706522,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

We developed an integrated population model to study the dynamics of the only remnant population of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) in North America, 1977-2013. Despite much conservation attention for this species, there has been little study on temporal variability in demography and how that variation contributes to population dynamics. Demographic rates were most variable for fledge rate and survival of the youngest age classes while adult survival was less variable. Population growth was influenced mainly by variation in fledge rate, breeding propensity and survival of hatch year and second year cranes while survival of older age classes had less influence. Fledge rates were correlated to the boreal snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus)-Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) cycle and were lowest 2 years after increases in lynx population growth. In terms of management, mean annual fledge rates were similar between years with and without egg collection for captive rearing (0.523 vs 0.518), suggesting no influence of this practice on population-level productivity. Our findings add to the growing body of results showing that while population growth may be most sensitive to changes in adult survival in long-lived vertebrates, variation in breeding parameters often drives annual fluctuations in abundance. Maintaining adult whooping crane survival at currently high rates and increasing breeding output where possible may be effective management strategies for achieving conservation goals.","10.1016/j.biocon.2016.02.022","Williams","Williams_544",247,0.367183741157698,0.312282656126459,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Air sac membrane thickening was observed in three cranes in the cranial and caudal thoracic air sacs, and air sac diverticulum opacification was observed in four cranes. Necropsy lesions consisted of severe, subacute to chronic, focally extensive granulomatous pathology of the trachea, primary bronchi, lungs, or air sacs. No false positive CT scan results were documented. Seven instances of false negative CT scan results occurred; six of these consisted of subtle, mild air sacculitis including membrane opacification or thickening, or the presence of small plaques found at necropsy. The number of CT tracheal bends was associated with bird age but not sex. Findings supported the use of CT as a diagnostic test for avian species with respiratory disease and tracheal coiling or elongated tracheae where endoscopic evaluation is impractical.","10.1111/vru.12306","Williams","Williams_546",243,0.257663755236836,-0.0302820438093677,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Despite 15 y of reintroduction efforts, the reproductive success of these whooping cranes has been near zero. Preliminary data suggest sandhill cranes nesting in central Wisconsin have apparent nest success rates that are similar to those reported from other populations in the region (~50%). One hypothesized cause of the whooping crane populations low reproductive success is nest abandonment induced by blood-feeding ornithophilic black flies Diptera: Simuliidae. Species-specific differences in selection of nest sites could influence the abundance of black flies at nests and affect reproductive success rates. We measured multiple vegetative and hydrologic characteristics at 35 sandhill crane nests, 20 whooping crane nests, and 164 randomly selected locations at 5- and 200-m scales. We were unable to detect a species-specific difference in vegetation characteristics within 5 m of nest sites. At the 200-m scale, sandhill cranes built nests at sites with slightly greater coverage of woody vegetation than whooping cranes. Differences observed between nest sites of sandhill and whooping cranes appeared to be slight and likely insufficient to explain the dramatic differences in reproductive success in central Wisconsin.","10.3996/032016-JFWM-025","Williams","Williams_547",194,0.178911664060502,0.158073879047661,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

The Program's Flow-Sediment-Mechanical management strategy consists of sediment augmentation, mechanical vegetation clearing and channel widening, channel consolidation, and short duration high flow releases of 142227 m3/s for three to five days in two out of three years in order to increase the unvegetated width of the main channel and, by extension, create and maintain suitable habitat for whooping crane use. We examined the influence of a range of hydrologic and physical metrics on total unvegetated channel width (TUCW) and maximum unobstructed channel width (MUOCW) during the period of 20072015 and applied those findings to assess the performance of the Flow-Sediment-Mechanical management strategy for creating and maintaining whooping crane roosting habitat. Our investigation highlights uncertainties that are introduced when exploring the relationship between physical process drivers and species habitat metrics. We identified a strong positive relationship between peak flows and TUCW and MUOCW within the Associated Habitat Reach of the central Platte River. However, the peak discharge magnitude and duration needed to create highly favorable whooping crane roosting habitat within our study area are much greater than short duration high flow releases, as currently envisioned. We also found disking in combination with herbicide application to vegetated portions of the channel are effective for creating and maintaining highly favorable unobstructed channel widths for whooping cranes in all but the very driest years. As such, resource managers could prioritize the treatment of mid-channel islands that are vegetated to increase the suitability of roosting habitat for whooping cranes.","10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e00851","Williams","Williams_558",287,0.415270175617084,0.591652490541559,"300","positive","positive_300",0
561,2018,"Examination of multiple working hypotheses to address reproductive failure in reintroduced Whooping Cranes","Condor","Understanding multiple challenges that restrict conservation success is a central task of applied ecology, especially when resources are limited and actions are expensive, such as with reintroduction programs. Simultaneous consideration of multiple hypotheses can expedite identification of factors that most limit conservation success. Since 2001, reintroduction of a migratory population of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) has been under way in eastern North America. Hatching success, however, has been extremely low. In our study area, in and near Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in central Wisconsin, USA, we simultaneously tested 3 hypotheses explaining poor hatching success: harassment of incubating birds by black flies (Simuliidae), effects of captivity, and inexperience of breeders. When black flies were experimentally suppressed, hatching probability doubled. Daily nest survival for Whooping Cranes was strongly and negatively related to an index of black fly abundance, particularly of Simulium annulus. Daily nest survival was negatively but only weakly related to the number of generations that ancestors of breeding Whooping Cranes had been in captivity and was not related to nesting experience. We also examined whether Whooping Cranes were nesting later to avoid stress from black flies. Phenology shifted earlier with more growing degree days and greater nesting experience and was only weakly related to year. Overall, improved hatching success did not lead to better reproductive success. Although effects of black flies on hatching success can be mitigated through management, such actions would not be adequate to generate satisfactory population growth. Recognition of this limitation was hastened through experimentation.","10.1650/CONDOR-17-263.1","Williams","Williams_561",246,0.39216340418361,-0.00537368731613314,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The present study sought to develop effective cryopreservation protocols for whooping (Grus americana) and white-naped (Grus vipio) cranes, through examining the influences of two permeating (DMA and Me 2 SO) and one non-permeating (sucrose) cryoprotectants, as well as vitamin E on post-thaw sperm survival. In Study 1, ejaculates (whooping: n = 10, white-naped: n = 8) were collected and cryopreserved in one of six cryo-diluents (crane extender with: DMA; DMA+0.1M sucrose; Me 2 SO; Me 2 SO+0.1M sucrose; 0.1M sucrose; 0.2M sucrose) using a two-step cooling method. Frozen samples were thawed and assessed for overall motility, motion characteristics, membrane integrity, morphology, and ability to bind to the inner perivitelline membrane (IPVM). In Study 2, whooping crane ejaculates (n = 17) were frozen in crane extender containing Me 2 SO alone or with vitamin E (5 µg/mL or 10 µg/mL). Frozen samples were thawed and assessed as in Study 1, except the binding assay. White-naped crane sperm were more tolerant to cryopreservation than whooping crane (15% vs 6% post-thawed motility). In both species, sperm cryopreserved in medium containing Me 2 SO alone displayed higher post thaw survival and ability to bind to IPVM than the other cryodiluent treatments. Vitamin E supplementation exerted no benefits to post thaw motility or membrane integrity. The findings demonstrated that there was species specificity in the susceptibility to cryopreservation. Nevertheless, Me 2 SO was a preferred cryoprotectant for sperm from both whooping and white-naped cranes.","10.1016/j.cryobiol.2018.01.010","Williams","Williams_562",262,0.23030625741421,0.157511661196115,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Specialization level was positively related to awareness, knowledge, and conservation attitudes.

574,2019,"The dilemma of pest suppression in the conservation of endangered species","Conservation Biology","In the conservation of endangered species, suppression of a population of one native species to benefit another poses challenges. Examples include predator control and nest parasite reduction. Less obvious is the control of blood-feeding arthropods. We conducted a case study of the effect of native black flies (Simulium spp.) on reintroduced Whooping Cranes (Grus americana). Our intent was to provide a science-driven approach for determining the effects of blood-feeding arthropods on endangered vertebrates and identifying optimal management actions for managers faced with competing objectives. A multiyear experiment demonstrated that black flies reduce nest success in cranes by driving incubating birds off their nests. We used a decision-analytic approach to develop creative management alternatives and evaluate trade-offs among competing objectives. We identified 4 management objectives: establish a self-sustaining crane population, improve crane well-being, maintain native black flies as functional components of the ecosystem, and minimize costs. We next identified potential management alternatives: do nothing, suppress black flies, force crane renesting to occur after the activity period of black flies, relocate releases of cranes, suppress black flies and relocate releases, or force crane renesting and relocate releases. We then developed predictions on constructed scales of 0 (worst-performing alternative) to 1 (best-performing alternative) to indicate how alternative actions performed in terms of management objectives. The optimal action depended on the relative importance of each objective to a decision maker. Only relocating releases was a dominated alternative, indicating that it was not optimal regardless of the relative importance of objectives. A rational decision maker could choose any other management alternative we considered. Recognizing that decisions involve trade-offs that must be weighed by decision makers is crucial to identifying alternatives that best balance multiple management objectives. Given uncertainty about the population dynamics of blood-feeding arthropods, an adaptive management approach could offer substantial benefits.","10.1111/cobi.13262","Williams","Williams_574",306,0.255497204871714,0.147021165903916,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
575,2019,"Factors affecting captive whooping crane egg fertility: A retrospective analysis","Journal of Wildlife Management","The whooping crane (Grus americana) has been managed in captivity since the 1960s following a substantial genetic bottleneck in the wild population. Through major ex situ conservation efforts, there are 158 whooping cranes managed in North American institutions and chicks are released annually into the wild. Current reintroduction goals for the whooping crane however, are impeded by poor reproduction within the ex situ population, in part because of low egg fertility. Development of improved management techniques to overcome low egg fertility requires a better understanding of factors that influence egg fertility. We collected data for eggs laid at Patuxent Wildlife Research Center from 20052014 (n = 438 eggs; n = 23 pairs). We constructed 5 sets of generalized linear mixed-models, with a Bernoulli-distributed response variable (fertile or infertile), to address the effects of egg-specific variables (month laid, sequence, and clutch order of the egg), life-history events of the male and female (age, rearing method, wing condition, age at first pairing, age at current pairing, and female age at first laying), pair-specific characteristics (kinship, years paired, chick-rearing experience, and previous pairings), and captive management decisions (inclusion in the artificial insemination program and pair experience chick-rearing) on the probability of egg fertility. Our results indicate that female-specific factors (especially age, age at current pairing, and wing status) and pair-specific factors of kinship, chick-rearing experience, copulation, and inclusion in the artificial insemination program influenced fertile egg production. Specifically, the younger a female is when paired with her current social mate, the higher probability that her eggs will be fertile. Furthermore, high kinship reduced fertility, whereas chick-rearing experience and artificial insemination of females with a donor male other than her social mate increased fertility. Further research on mate selection and reproductive mechanisms is needed to better understand egg laying and egg fertility in the whooping crane. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21717","Williams","Williams_575",309,0.280977264226006,0.282912133040184,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
577,2019,"Long-term demographic and genetic effects of releasing captive-born individuals into the wild","Conservation Biology","Because of continued habitat destruction and species extirpations, the need to use captive breeding for conservation purposes has been increasing steadily. However, the long-term demographic and genetic effects associated with releasing captive-born individuals with varied life histories into the wild remain largely unknown. To address this question, we developed forward-time, agent-based models for 4 species with long-running captive-breeding and release programs: coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia), western toad (Anaxyrus boreas), and Whooping Crane (Grus americana). We measured the effects of supplementation by comparing population size and neutral genetic diversity in supplemented populations to the same characteristics in unaltered populations 100 years after supplementation ended. Releasing even slightly less fit captive-born individuals to supplement wild populations typically resulted in reductions in population sizes and genetic diversity over the long term when the fitness reductions were heritable (i.e., due to genetic adaptation to captivity) and populations continued to be regulated by density-dependent mechanisms over time. Negative effects for species with longer life spans and lower rates of population replacement were smaller than for species with shorter life spans and higher rates of population replacement. Programs that released captive-born individuals over fewer years or that avoided breeding individuals with captive ancestry had smaller reductions in population size and genetic diversity over the long term. Relying on selection in the wild to remove individuals with reduced fitness mitigated some negative demographic effects, but at a substantial cost to neutral genetic diversity. Our results suggest that conservation-focused captive-breeding programs should take measures to prevent even small amounts of genetic adaptation to captivity, quantitatively determine the minimum number of captive-born individuals to release each year, and fully account for the interactions among genetic adaptation to captivity, population regulation, and life-history variation.","10.1111/cobi.13217","Williams","Williams_577",301,0.158648441043333,-0.0408406355443362,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
578,2019,"Whooping crane use of riverine stopover sites","PLoS ONE","Migratory birds like endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) require suitable nocturnal roost sites during twice annual migrations. Whooping cranes primarily roost in shallow surface water wetlands, ponds, and rivers. All these features have been greatly impacted by human activities, which present threats to the continued recovery of the species. A portion of one such river, the central Platte River, has been identified as critical habitat for the survival of the endangered whooping crane. Management intervention is now underway to rehabilitate habitat form and function on the central Platte River to increase use and thereby contribute to the survival of whooping cranes. The goal of our analyses was to develop habitat selection models that could be used to direct riverine habitat management activities (i.e., channel widening, tree removal, flow augmentation, etc.) along the central Platte River and throughout the species range. As such, we focused our analyses on two robust sets of whooping crane observations and habitat metrics the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program (Program or PRRIP) and other such organizations could influence. This included channel characteristics such as total channel width, the width of channel unobstructed by dense vegetation, and distance of forest from the edge of the channel and flow-related metrics like wetted width and unit discharge (flow volume per linear meter of wetted channel width) that could be influenced by flow augmentation or reductions during migration. We used 17 years of systematic monitoring data in a discrete-choice framework to evaluate the influence these various metrics have on the relative probability of whooping crane use and found the width of channel unobstructed by dense vegetation and distance to the nearest forest were the best predictors of whooping crane use. Secondly, we used telemetry data obtained from a sample of 38 birds of all ages over the course of seven years, 20102016, to evaluate whooping crane use of riverine habitat within the North-central Great Plains, USA. For this second analysis, we focused on the two metrics found to be important predictors of whooping crane use along the central Platte River, unobstructed channel width and distance to nearest forest or wooded area. Our findings indicate resource managers, such as the Program, have the potential to influence whooping crane use of the central Platte River through removal of in-channel vegetation to increase the unobstructed width of narrow channels and through removal of trees along the bank line to increase unforested corridor widths. Results of both analyses also indicated that increases in relative probability of use by whooping cranes did not appreciably increase with unobstructed views 200 m wide and unforested corridor widths that were 330 m. Therefore, managing riverine sites for channels widths >200 m and removing trees beyond 165 m from the channels edge would increase costs associated with implementing management actions such as channel and bank-line disking, removing trees, augmenting flow, etc. without necessarily realizing an additional appreciable increase in use by migrating whooping cranes.","10.1371/journal.pone.0209612","Williams","Williams_578",485,0.240442606887983,0.204301781178626,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

In reintroduced populations, managers often attempt to promote adaptive behaviors by controlling the early life experiences of individuals, but it remains largely unknown whether this early life training has lasting effects on behavior. We investigated the behavior of reintroduced whooping cranes (Grus americana) trained to migrate using two different methods to see whether their migration behavior remained different or converged over time. We found that the behavior of the two groups converged relatively rapidly, indicating that early life training may not produce lasting effects, especially in species that display lifelong learning and behavioral adaptation. In some cases, managers may consider continual behavioral interventions after release if desired behaviors are not present. Understanding the roles early life experience and animal cultures play in determining behavior is crucial for successful reintroduction programs.","10.1111/conl.12599","Williams","Williams_579",149,0.141999233741717,0.230163834797385,"150","neutral","neutral_150",0

Physiological responses to stress can compromise growth and reproduction, increase susceptibility to infection and lead to deleterious effects on health and conservation efforts. However, physiological measures of energetic stress in association with habitat disturbance are uncommon, especially for wild primate species. Here, we report differences in the stress hormone cortisol in two subpopulations of wild gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) inhabiting disturbed and undisturbed forest areas of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Cortisol levels were assessed via opportunistically and noninvasively collected urine samples using previously validated methods. We hypothesized that mangabeys in disturbed forest (DF) areas would experience greater stress and therefore exhibit higher average cortisol levels than conspecifics in nearby relatively undisturbed forest areas (UF). As predicted, mangabeys in the disturbed area had significantly higher cortisol levels (unpaired t-test of log transformed data, t=4.88, d.f.=108, P<0.0001). Mangabeys in undisturbed forest exhibited expected diurnal patterns of cortisol excretion while those in disturbed areas did not, suggesting alteration of the circadian pattern of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function (DF, r=0.12, P=0.43; UF, r=0.35, P=0.005). Reasons for differences are unclear, but could include altered food availability and distribution, human contact or other anthropogenic effects.

612,2012,"Influence of space use on fitness and the reintroduction success of the   Laysan teal","Animal Conservation","Translocation is an important tool for wildlife conservation and biodiversity restoration, but an inefficient one because of the unpredictability of success. Predictors of success such as habitat quality of the release site and number of individuals released have been identified, but the dynamics of successful translocations remain poorly understood. In particular, little is known about the relationship of individual post-release movements to population establishment. In 2004, Laysan teal Anas laysanensis were reintroduced by translocating 20 wild birds from Laysan Island to Midway Atoll. Twenty-two additional wild founders were brought the next year. We monitored the survival, reproductive success and movements of the 42 translocated individuals and their offspring for 4 years. Additionally, we monitored population size from 2004 to 2010. Unlike most translocations, we did not observe elevated post-release mortality despite flight-feather trimming to prevent immediate dispersal off-island: first year survival was >90% and survival rates until 2009 were 0.65±0.08 for founding adults. Laysan teal flew between the two main islands of Midway Atoll, and offspring had significantly larger maximum movement distances than founders. We monitored 84 nests and observed a significant, negative relationship of home range size to productivity for founding females. Flightless founders did not show fidelity to their release sites, but had strong fidelity to annual home ranges after attaining flight. Although we observed a component Allee effect on mate-finding, this did not translate into a demographic Allee effect, and generally, the high fitness of founders contributed substantially to successful population establishment. Laysan teal abundance increased linearly until 2009, but showed evidence of population regulation afterwards. The population estimate was 473 (95% confidence interval 439-508) in 2010. On the much larger main Hawaiian Islands, we expect greater post-release movement, a stronger component Allee effect, lower survival and lower reproductive rates because of predation to preclude successful reintroductions of this species to sites without predator management. © 2012 The Authors.

613,2012,"Unexpected outcomes of invasive predator control: the importance of   evaluating conservation management actions","Animal Conservation","Decisions regarding the implementation of conservation management actions should be based on the effectiveness of past investments. However, because of limited evaluation of existing data, actions may be prescribed without evidence of producing a beneficial conservation outcome. We analysed empirical data, collected over 23 years across southern Australia, on the impact of fox baiting on malleefowl to determine its effectiveness. We employed data from extensive monitoring surveys to evaluate the observed relationships between investment in fox control, fox baiting intensity, fox presence and two alternative measures of the malleefowl's response: the number of breeding pairs and population growth. This study is the first to quantify the return on investment from fox control in a conservation context. We discovered there is limited quantitative evidence for a benefit of fox baiting on malleefowl, despite it being the main management action implemented for this nationally threatened, well-studied and iconic species. We found that fox baiting did not significantly decrease the presence of foxes and fox presence was positively correlated with malleefowl conservation. Malleefowl breeding population size increased with investment in baiting, although this relationship depended on the number of years the site had been baited. Nonetheless, most sites had a negative relationship between investment and breeding population. In contrast, malleefowl population growth did not benefit from baiting, suggesting that fox baiting is generally not a cost-effective management action for the conservation of this species. This study provides a powerful example of why management decisions should be based on evidence, rather than ecological intuition. Even though the malleefowl is one of the best-monitored species of conservation concern in Australia, we are still uncertain how to cost-effectively manage this species. We emphasize the urgent need to assess what data we have and determine which species and what actions are most in need of evaluation. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00537.x","Williams","Williams_613",307,0.335497608888926,0.0943407946595569,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
614,2012,"Cross-scale predictions allow the identification of local conservation   priorities from atlas data","Animal Conservation","For planning practical measures aimed at biodiversity protection, conservation priorities must be identified at a local scale. Unfortunately, identifying local conservation priorities requires high-resolution data on species distribution, and these are often unavailable. Atlases of species distribution provide data for several groups of organisms in many different areas but are often too coarse in resolution to provide valuable information. We explored the possibility of cross-scale modelling species distributions and we clarified, for the first time, its effect on prioritization exercises. We used different modelling techniques for scaling down atlas data for Sardinian reptiles, validated the outcomes with detailed, field-sampled data, and compared conservation priorities deriving from atlas maps and downscaled models. Doing this, we obtained as a further result the identification of priority species and areas for future conservation strategies. Our results encourage us to experiment further with this approach. Through the downscaling procedure, we obtain high-resolution models with strong variations in predictive performances, although most of the models show satisfactory/excellent scores. This testifies that low-resolution data can be downscaled maintaining low rates of omission and commission errors. Increasing the resolution of distribution maps used for prioritization influences the spatial patterns of priority but does not modify the evaluation of species representation. Overall, we show that atlases can meet the large demand for distribution data by decision makers if appropriate downscaling procedures are adopted. In addition, we provide practical instruments for the conservation of reptiles in Sardinia by identifying priority species and areas that require strict management. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00526.x","Williams","Williams_614",258,0.421650514519659,0.344063932536094,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
615,2012,"Bird functional diversity and wildfires in the Amazon: the role of   forest structure","Animal Conservation","Fire is becoming a common phenomenon in Amazonian forest, modifying the structure and composition of natural assemblages. In particular, fire is known to affect patterns of bird diversity in tropical forests, but we have little understanding of the consequences of this for the functional diversity of bird assemblages. For example, frequent fires could act as an environmental filter selecting species with similar traits and, thus, producing a functional clustering pattern. Here, we used body mass, and dietary and foraging traits to calculate the functional structure of understorey bird assemblages in Amazonian forests analysed 3 years after they had passed under three disturbance levels within the 1997-1998 El-Niño period: unburned, burned once and burned twice. First, we tested whether observed levels of functional diversity were different among these forests and also from what one would expect by chance. Then, we investigated if habitat structure was able to predict changes in the functional structure of the studied bird assemblages. In general, there was no evidence of fire reducing functional diversity nor selecting species functionally more similar than expected by chance. Therefore, bird functional diversity was not different from random in unburned and burned forests. This provides some evidence in favour of high functional redundancy of bird species in the tropics, but also indicates that neutral theories of biodiversity, where processes such as dispersal and survival are more important than biological traits to community assembly, may apply to the assemblages studied. Also, we showed that bird assemblages from forests disturbed by wildfires have the tendency to be functionally overdispersed whereas assemblages from pristine forests tend to be functionally clustered. Thus, environmental structure, in part driven by forest responses to fire, is more important than simple categorical definitions of burn frequency for explaining trait-based assembly rules of understorey birds in the Amazon forest. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00528.x","Williams","Williams_615",304,0.204339989547589,0.135423173622228,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
616,2012,"Habitat relationships among biodiversity indicators and co-occurring   species in a freshwater fish community","Animal Conservation","It is often assumed that indicator species can act as surrogates for conservation of other taxa because the habitat characteristics that limit the distribution of indicators should also affect multiple co-occurring native species. However, this assumption is rarely explicitly tested. Here, we test whether four fish species are potential indicators of overall fish diversity in the Bear River drainage (UT and WY, USA). We then examine whether biodiversity indicator relationships are driven by shared habitat associations among species by examining species-habitat models. We use these models to test for correlations between indicator species and common co-occurring species in predicted occurrence and density. Fish diversity was higher at sites with potential indicators than sites without, indicating that conservation aimed at any of these species is likely to affect a broad number of co-occurring taxa. However, with minor exceptions, habitat correlations were inconsistent between indicator and co-occurring species. Instead, most species showed idiosyncratic habitat relationships. Thus, while conservation of habitats containing indicator species is likely to positively affect the distribution of a minority of co-occurring taxa, they may have neutral (or even negative) effects on the distribution or abundance of a majority of other native taxa that are common to the region. These data suggest that reliance on indicator taxa in conservation can be misleading because they obscure important ecological information about affected non-target species. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.","10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00538.x","Williams","Williams_616",235,0.217705485415669,0.190647570965816,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

We studied the pattern of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx population genetic variability in the westernmost part of its natural range from Scandinavia to the Carpathian Mountains (north-central Europe) based on 190 samples using 613 base pair-long sequences from the mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA-cr). We examined whether the population history or contemporary habitat constraints of this large and mobile carnivore could have significantly affected its genetic structure. We recorded nine mtDNA haplotypes, including five not previously reported. Lynx from Latvia and Estonia had the highest variability with haplotype and nucleotide diversities of 0.81-0.88% and 0.44-0.47%, respectively. In contrast, there was no polymorphism present in peripheral populations from Norway and the Carpathian Mountains. Lynx populations were strongly differentiated [analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA): F ST=0.570, P<0.001, F ST=0.464, P<0.001)]. Spatial Analysis of Molecular Variance identified four separate groups of populations: (1) Norway, Finland and Estonia; (2) Latvia and North Eastern Poland; (3) the Bialowieza Primeval Forest; (4) the Carpathians. The patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation suggested a number of discrete populations that are poorly connected by contemporary gene flow and could therefore be considered demographically independent. The peripheral location of these populations, habitat fragmentation and the strict territorial structure of lynx populations are factors likely contributing to the observed patterns. The study provides suggestions for active conservation/management decisions including translocations or reintroductions of lynx.

620,2017,"Divergent forecasts for two salt marsh specialists in response to sea   level rise","Animal Conservation","Ecosystem specialists are predicted to be more vulnerable to global change than generalists, but whether specialists within an ecosystem will respond similarly to those changes is often largely unknown. Will specialists track changes in their habitats as a group, or are their distributions governed by landscape gradients that will make some species more sensitive to habitat changes? In this study, we forecasted the effects of sea level rise (SLR) on two salt marsh specialist bird species: clapper rails Rallus crepitans and seaside sparrows Ammodramus maritimus. We sampled the abundance of these two species in salt marshes throughout the Georgia, USA, coast in 20132014, and analyzed count data using a Bayesian N-mixture model. Model predictions were applied to an SLR land cover model to determine distribution shifts over 100 years. Both species distributions were most sensitive to the relative elevation gradient, with clapper rails using lower elevation marshes and seaside sparrows using higher elevation marshes. These disparities in habitat use, along with other differences according to marsh salinity and distance to forested areas, led to divergent responses to SLR. Clapper rail habitat is predicted to increase with SLR by 52%, but seaside sparrow habitat will contract by 81% by the year 2100. Seaside sparrow habitat is not predicted to decline until sometime between 2025 and 2050, at which point the decline will rapidly accelerate, indicating the importance of careful monitoring in future decades. Diverging responses to a global perturbation create a conservation planning dilemma: if specialists have opposing responses to SLR, it may be difficult to manage conservation areas that accommodate many species.","10.1111/acv.12280","Williams","Williams_620",256,0.163808951589121,0.101825893353079,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
621,2017,"National assessment of threatened species using sparse data: IUCN Red   List classification of Anatidae in Iran","Animal Conservation","Classifying the status of threatened species using tools such as the IUCN Red List is a critical step for identifying at-risk species, and for conservation planning at global and sub-global levels. The requirement for data on population trends, geographic ranges and population sizes has proved challenging to carry out at the national level, especially in countries with unstructured and spatially limited monitoring schemes and limited conservation resources. In this study, we investigated the repeatability of risk assessments made under the IUCN Red List guidelines for assessment at the national level. Specifically, we assessed the national threat status of breeding and non-breeding populations of Anatidae in Iran using population and distribution data. The variable quality of these data led to uncertainties in decision-making. To evaluate the impact of these uncertainties on population trend estimates, we generated a range of alternative possible threat categories under three scenarios of population trend estimation. For the non-breeding populations, for which long-term population data were available, we were able to classify 93% of species, 72% of which were placed in threatened categories. For the breeding populations, 78% of the species were categorized as Data Deficient. Of those species in data-sufficient categories, 67% were classified as threatened. We conclude that effective use of the IUCN categories and criteria at the national level is hampered in situations where monitoring schemes have a short history. Therefore, available data need to be complemented with some level of standardized data collection. We further make suggestions about efficient means of data collection in such cases and the importance of the use of modeling techniques prior to Red Listing and discuss the most useful IUCN criteria for threat categorization in such circumstances.","10.1111/acv.12282","Williams","Williams_621",282,0.250143728569014,0.0759417410085561,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Many protected areas with high conservation value, but little funding, lack charismatic species. Exploring tourists' preferences alternative to charismatic species may help identify ecotourism markets that are more likely to support such areas. We used a choice experiment and latent class model to explore tourists' heterogeneous preference for biodiversity and biodiversity-related activities in South African national parks. We found that tourists' preferences were not restricted to charismatic species, but extended to less charismatic biodiversity, as well as to landscapes. In addition, biodiversity-related activities, such as camping and game drives, the sense of wilderness attached to the place tourists were visiting and accessibility of protected areas, also affected tourists' preferences. Particularly, domestic tourists, as well as more experienced international tourists, were more likely to support initiatives that promote a broader biodiversity experience than charismatic species alone, and were prepared to travel longer distances to do so. Our results reveal new opportunities to promote and support biodiversity conservation at sites where only less charismatic biodiversity is present. In addition, our results may help inform land-use planning based on public preferences for biodiversity conservation, incorporating sense of place.","10.1111/acv.12292","Williams","Williams_623",218,0.529467513242638,0.692536269643255,"250","positive","positive_250",0
625,2017,"Local factors mediate the response of biodiversity to land use on two   African mountains","Animal Conservation","Land-use change is the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss in the tropics. Biodiversity models can be useful tools to inform policymakers and conservationists of the likely response of species to anthropogenic pressures, including land-use change. However, such models generalize biodiversity responses across wide areas and many taxa, potentially missing important characteristics of particular sites or clades. Comparisons of biodiversity models with independently collected field data can help us understand the local factors that mediate broad-scale responses. We collected independent bird occurrence and abundance data along two elevational transects in Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania and the Taita Hills, Kenya. We estimated the local response to land use and compared our estimates with modelled local responses based on a large database of many different taxa across Africa. To identify the local factors mediating responses to land use, we compared environmental and species assemblage information between sites in the independent and African-wide datasets. Bird species richness and abundance responses to land use in the independent data followed similar trends as suggested by the African-wide biodiversity model, however the land-use classification was too coarse to capture fully the variability introduced by local agricultural management practices. A comparison of assemblage characteristics showed that the sites on Kilimanjaro and the Taita Hills had higher proportions of forest specialists in croplands compared to the Africa-wide average. Local human population density, forest cover and vegetation greenness also differed significantly between the independent and Africa-wide datasets. Biodiversity models including those variables performed better, particularly in croplands, but still could not accurately predict the magnitude of local species responses to most land uses, probably because local features of the land management are still missed. Overall, our study demonstrates that local factors mediate biodiversity responses to land use and cautions against applying biodiversity models to local contexts without prior knowledge of which factors are locally relevant.","10.1111/acv.12327","Williams","Williams_625",313,0.141730238863907,0.110010470793827,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Here we use original data from a unique natural experiment to study some of the mechanisms by which African lions Panthera leo impact on African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. Using a study site where wild dogs outnumbered lions for several years prior to lion population recovery, we aimed to investigate whether or not, and by which means, wild dog populations are regulated and influenced by lions. We used 38 pack-years of demographic and behavioural data across two 4-year periods where lion density differed 20-fold (pre-lion era: 19961999 and lion era: 20102013) to assess how lions may affect wild dog pack size and age structure, litter size and pup survival (n = 329 pups), as well as den site selection (n = 46 dens). Pack size was significantly greater during the pre-lion era. The pup to adult ratio was lower during the lion era and the change in pack composition was directly attributable to significantly greater lion-induced pup mortality. We also demonstrate a behavioural shift, with locations selected for the vulnerable denning period being in more rugged terrain and in areas with lower prey densities during the lion era, as compared with the pre-lion era. Lower adult recruitment into a population of an obligate cooperative breeder like the African wild dog can have complex consequences, including on feeding and defence of young, and mate finding.","10.1111/acv.12328","Williams","Williams_626",248,0.209119852373215,0.099983614299124,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
627,2017,"Grain spilled from moving trains create a substantial wildlife   attractant in protected areas","Animal Conservation","Transportation corridors can attract threatened wildlife via habitat enhancement and foraging opportunities, leading to collisions with vehicles. But wildlife may also be attracted to energy-dense food products that are spilled or discarded from moving vehicles, which is rarely studied. Therefore, we quantified train-spilled attractants in Banff and Yoho National Parks, Canada, where agricultural products (hereafter, grain) are transported along 134 km of railway and may contribute to wildlife mortality. We measured grain deposition from 2012 to 2015 at 19 sites and assessed the performance of three structures developed to measure spilled grain. We then modeled grain deposition with respect to four types of spatial and temporal variables: those related to grain shipment, physical habitat characteristic, train-related characteristics and variables specific to the study site. Grain was spilled at a mean rate of 1.64 g m-2 day-1 (sd = 3.60) from April to October (n = 3 years) and 1.52 (sd = 2.37) from November to March (n = 1 year). Extrapolating annual deposition across the study area yielded enough grain (110 tons) to provide 4.77 × 108 kcal of gross energy, which is equivalent to the average annual caloric needs of 4254 grizzly bears Ursus arctos horribilis; the regional population is estimated at 5073 animals. Much of this energy will not be accessible or available to bears; however, their attraction to it could contribute to rising and unsustainable rates of mortality. Models explained 931% of the variance in deposition for each grain type, primarily via coarse temporal variables of shipping rates and month. The absence of more specific predictive variables suggests that mitigation should target broader policies, such as prompt reporting and repair of leaky hopper cars, and limits to train stoppage in protected areas. We encourage more global assessment of the under-studied issue of food attractants spilled by vehicles along transportation corridors.","10.1111/acv.12336","Williams","Williams_627",286,0.244351504551851,0.104318406511316,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Here, we used species distribution modelling (SDM) of tracking data from 14 seabird species to identify key marine areas in the southwest Atlantic Ocean, valuing areas based on seabird species occurrence, seasonality and extinction risk. We also compared overlaps between the outputs generated by the SDM and layers representing important human threats (fishing intensity, ship density, plastic and oil pollution, ocean acidification), and calculated loss in conservation value using fishing and ship density as cost layers. The key marine areas were located on the southern Patagonian Shelf, overlapping extensively with areas of high fishing activity, and did not change seasonally, while seasonal areas were located off south and southeast Brazil and overlapped with areas of high plastic pollution and ocean acidification. Non-seasonal key areas were located off northeast Brazil on an area of high biodiversity, and with relatively low human impacts. We found support for the use of seasonal areas depending on the seabird assemblage used, because there was a loss in conservation value for the seasonal compared to the non-seasonal approach when using cost layers. Our approach, accounting for seasonal changes in seabird assemblages and their risk of extinction, identified additional candidate areas for incorporation in the network of pelagic MPAs.","10.1111/acv.12339","Williams","Williams_628",232,0.186875729233884,0.15791614291012,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

A conservation status assessment based on 17 years of field studies directed to record habitat decline indicates that five species of seasonal killifish, Leptolebias marmoratus, Nematolebias papilliferus, Notholebias cruzi, Notholebias fractifasciatus and Ophthalmolebias constanciae, distributed among three areas of endemism, are on the edge of survival. Conservation priority, focusing on five remnant isolated locations where those species occur, was evaluated on the basis of the phylogenetic diversity content of each location established through a phylogenetic base containing data on relationships of 118 cynolebiasine species, including all species endemic to Rio. Data on species diversity for each area and data on morphological uniqueness were subsequently compared and discussed. The Barra de São João pool, in the São João-Cabo Frio area, habitat of Nematolebias whitei, No. cruzi, O. constanciae, concentrates the highest value for conservation proposal, followed by the Inoã pool, in the Maricá area, habitat of Ne. papilliferus and No. fractifasciatus. However, in case of the Barra de São João pool being effectively preserved, it is recommended to concentrate efforts to preserve the Cava swamp as a second priority, since although the latter location showing the lowest individual value, Cava swamp and Barra de São João pool together sum a higher phylogenetic diversity index by preserving more distinct cynolebiasine lineages. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10531-012-0301-7","Williams","Williams_664",236,0.145235608606624,0.148103778976744,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Therefore, threatened species lists are a powerful tool for conservation planning and prioritization. Our objective is to compare the global, the national and state red lists of amphibians in Brazil. Threatened species were categorized according to their listing in one or several of these lists. We analyzed for true inconsistencies across lists in order to evaluate practical consequences of such incongruences on amphibian conservation in Brazil. We recorded a total of 61 threatened amphibian species in Brazil (across all red lists). Only one species, Phrynomedusa fimbriata, was listed as Extinct (both in IUCN, Brazil and São Paulo lists). A total of eleven endemic species are listed as threatened by the global red list, but do not appear in Brazil's national red list, which represent an inconsistence among these lists. Besides that, the threat category of Thoropa lutzi and Thoropa petropolitana, two endemic species, differ among both lists, which also represents a problem between both lists. These mismatches may be due to several reasons such as different interpretation of the criteria; different methodologies used; different data availability on species; differences in the dates of assessments processes; the assessors' attitudes to uncertainty; outdated red lists. Harmonization among red lists permits a better picture of threatened amphibian diversity across scales and to develop global, national and state plans to complement conservation actions in order to maximize the chance of success of these initiatives. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10531-012-0322-2","Williams","Williams_665",250,0.347446290923834,0.0378436753690893,"250","neutral","neutral_250",1

We investigated the impact of bark beetle attacks and subsequent salvage logging on insectivorous bats in a temperate mountain forest. We quantified bat activity (25,373 min counts; 32 plots) using batcorders during 221 all-night surveys in stands killed by bark beetles, with dead trees removed or not, and in vital, single- or multi-layered mature forest stands. We analysed the differences in activity of all bats in general and of bats of foraging guilds (open habitat, forest edge, closed habitat) in these habitats using a generalized linear Poisson mixed model, with plot and observation as random factors, and temperature and habitat as fixed factors. Only open-habitat foragers were slightly more active in salvage-logged stands than in bark-beetle-affected stands; they generally benefited from an open forest canopy, whereas closed-habitat foragers did not. Our results indicated that: (1) bats are less affected by salvage logging after a disturbance of a magnitude typical for European forests, probably because enough roosts are present in surrounding areas, (2) habitats for open foragers are improved by bark beetle infestation and (3) bats are poor bioindicators of negative impacts of salvage logging after natural disturbance in forests with a composition typical for Central Europe. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10531-012-0334-y","Williams","Williams_666",218,0.38052684016715,-0.033010836985838,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
667,2012,"Exploited for pets: the harvest and trade of amphibians and reptiles   from Indonesian New Guinea","Biodiversity and Conservation","Over-exploitation of wildlife is a significant threat to global biodiversity, but addressing the sustainability of harvests can be difficult when trade is conducted illegally. The wildlife trade is driven chiefly by consumer demand, largely in developed nations (but increasingly in Asia), and more species are traded to meet international demand for pets than for any other purpose. We surveyed traders of amphibians and reptiles in the Indonesian provinces of Maluku, West Papua and Papua between September 2010 and April 2011. We recorded 5,370 individuals representing 52 species collected solely for the pet trade. At least 44 % were either fully protected or had not been allocated a harvest quota, making their harvest and trade illegal. Approximately half were listed within the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Trade operates via a complex chain, with hunters receiving little income compared to middlemen and exporters. Examination of Indonesian harvest quotas for amphibians and reptiles suggests limited knowledge of species distributions, with quotas often set for species in provinces where they do not occur. Illegal trade is due, partly, to an inadequate understanding of the species being traded and is facilitated by poor monitoring and enforcement at key trade hubs. As a first step to combatting illegal trade, and to better understand the effects of harvest on wild populations, we recommend the need for increased monitoring and enforcement, improving the knowledge base of species traded and educating consumers about the effects their demand for pets has on these species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10531-012-0345-8","Williams","Williams_667",253,0.240816032021099,-0.110689883018607,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

From a conservation perspective, identifying the primary preferred habitats could help improve the foraging conditions of target species and, consequently, enhance their breeding success and survival. Here, we investigated the ranging behaviour and foraging habitat selection of the European roller (Coracias garrulus) during the breeding season in an agricultural landscape of South Iberia. The occurrence of foraging rollers was predicted to gradually increase with decreasing distance from the nest and increasing availability of perches, such as fences and electric wires. Traditional olive groves and stubble fields were positively and negatively associated with the occurrence of rollers, respectively. Additionally, analysis of hunting strikes showed that rollers highly prefer foraging in fallows rather than cereal or stubble fields. Prey surveys revealed that fallows had the highest abundance of grasshoppers, rollers preferred prey during chick-rearing. Pair home-ranges, obtained from 95% fixed Kernel estimators averaged 70.9 ha (range = 34118 ha) and most foraging trips (80%) occurred in the close vicinity of the nest (<500 m). Number of chicks fledged was not affected by mean foraging distances travelled during the chick-rearing period. Overall, our results suggest that traditional extensive practices of cereal cultivation, with large areas of low-intensity grazed fallows, represent a high-quality foraging habitat for rollers and should be promoted through agri-environmental schemes within at least 1-km radius from the nest. These recommendations are targeted at the roller, but have been shown to apply broadly to several other steppe-bird species.","10.1007/s10531-016-1241-4","Williams","Williams_670",252,0.348266112517557,0.230457643345792,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

We conducted surveys from 2003 to 2011 in eight of the 12 mountain blocks in Tanzania, and, through an overall sampling effort of 11,500 camera days, we detected 43 species. We normalized species richness and species detection events by effort, and used these metrics to assess the effect of habitat and human disturbance variables. We found that rarefied richness is positively affected by forest area at the block level, and that richness at forest patch level is also affected by forest area as well as surrounding human density (negative effect). For a subset of 17 species, we found consistent patterns of avoidance or tolerance of human disturbance and forest edges, and increased occurrence in areas at higher elevation, matching the historical forest loss that in most mountains occurred at lower elevation. Our study provides ecological insights that are novel for most species and sites, and reveals a general trend of negative impact of human disturbance on both community size and species relative abundance.

Management strategies are urgently required to halt further habitat decline and to aid in restoration of this important moss-dominated summit community. Grazing exclosure and phosphorus (P) addition experiments were conducted at 10 sites across the UK to assess the potential of Racomitrium heath to respond to (1) the removal of grazing pressure, and (2) the addition of P, a measure intended to alleviate the impacts of high N deposition. After two years, growth and depth of Racomitrium lanuginosum, the dominant moss species, were significantly enhanced by both treatments. However, while the addition of P resulted in increased cover of R. lanuginosum and decreased grass cover, grazing exclusion resulted in the opposite effects. While both practices clearly have the potential to promote improvement in the condition of Racomitrium heath, their suitability for individual sites appears to differ. Results indicate that for the most degraded heaths, where grass abundance is high, complete removal of grazing pressure may, at least initially, stimulate grass performance, potentially leading to further habitat decline. The addition of P, on the other hand, appears to produce desirable effects in terms of both R. lanuginosum performance and community composition, and thus could be used as a local management option to kick-start recovery in the most damaged heaths. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2012.04.025","Williams","Williams_711",239,0.228542221726688,0.236899417379558,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

There, the causes of decline have not been properly identified and conservation decisions are too frequently based on poor evidence. We analysed the trend of a relict capercaillie population in the Spanish Pyrenees on the basis of bird densities during the period 1989-2010, and we developed the first modelling exercise for the dynamics of a capercaillie population in southern Europe. We also explored management actions commonly used to enhance endangered prey species thought to be affected by hyperpredation: the release of captive-bred females, in varying numbers, the removal of predators and the combination of both actions, using available information from past captive-breeding experiments and from an ongoing experiment involving the removal of terrestrial mesopredators. The population was found to be declining at an annual rate of 4%. Restraining the unknown adult survival rate according to values reported in the literature, our modelling approach showed that recruitment (productivity. +. fledgling survival), rather than adult survival, was the demographic parameter to be improved as a result of management and, thus, most likely to increase the population growth rate. The removal of terrestrial mesocarnivores may lead to the stabilisation of the capercaillie population (lambda 0.99. ±. 0.06), through the improvement of productivity, although this result should be considered as preliminary. However, the most effective management strategy was the combination of predator removal together with the release of 15, 30 or 45 adult females per year. These strategies should be viewed as urgency measures and should be implemented in combination with other long-term measures, such as the reduction of forest density, which may influence predation rate and food availability, and the control of the numbers of wild ungulates, which could be subsidising mesopredators in the area.

The current extinction crisis has resulted in a wealth of monitoring programs focussed on tracking the status of threatened species, and the perceived importance of monitoring has seen it become the cornerstone of many biodiversity conservation programs. However, many monitoring programs fail to produce useful outcomes due to inherent flaws. Here we use a monitoring program from south-eastern Australia as a case study to illustrate the potential of such endeavours. The threatened carnivorous marsupial, the brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa), has been monitored at various locations between 2000 and 2010. We present strong evidence for a decline in relative abundance during this period, and also describe relationships with environmental variables. These results provide insights likely to be valuable in guiding future management of the species. In the absence of the monitoring program, informed management would not be possible. While early detection of population declines is important, knowledge of the processes driving such declines is required for effective intervention. We argue that monitoring programs will be most effective as a tool for enhanced conservation management if they test specific hypotheses relating to changes in population trajectories. Greater emphasis should be placed on rigorous statistical analysis of monitoring datasets in order to capitalise on the resources devoted to monitoring activities. Many datasets are likely to exist for which careful analysis of results would have benefits for determining management directions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","10.1016/j.biocon.2011.10.016","Williams","Williams_719",240,0.273082586287576,0.154559793791873,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
720,2017,"Free-ranging livestock threaten the long-term survival of giant pandas","Biological Conservation","China has implemented forest policies and expanded protected areas to halt deforestation and protect giant panda habitats. These policies simultaneously encouraged local communities to raise livestock that then freely range in forests. This grazing had unintended consequences. As an alternative livelihood, it has become the most prevalent human disturbance across the panda's range. How do free-ranging livestock impact giant panda habitats and what are the implications for future conservation and policy on a larger scale? We use Wanglang National Nature Reserve as a case study. It has seen a nine-fold livestock increase during past 15 years. We combined bamboo survey plots, GPS collar tracking, long-term monitoring, and species distribution modelling incorporating species interaction to understand the impacts across spatial and temporal scales. Our results showed that livestock, especially horses, lead to a significant reduction of bamboo biomass and regeneration. The most intensively used areas by livestock are in the valleys, which are also the areas that pandas prefer. Adding livestock presence to predictive models of the giant panda's distribution yielded a higher accuracy and suggested livestock reduce panda habitat by 34%. Pandas were driven out of the areas intensively used by livestock. We recommend the nature reserve carefully implement a livestock ban and prioritise removing horses because they cause the greater harm. To give up livestock, local communities prefer long-term subsidies or jobs to a one-time payment. Thus, we recommend the government provide payments for ecosystem services that create jobs in forest stewardship or tourism while reducing the number of domestic animals.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.09.019","Williams","Williams_720",255,0.214984029450088,0.101033788614003,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
721,2017,"Evidence of reproductive senescence of released individuals in a   reinforced bird population","Biological Conservation","In free-ranging populations, age-dependent variation in fitness related parameters, in particular the pattern of senescence, has major eco-evolutionary implications and potential influence on population dynamics. Despite the recent surge of studies of senescence in the wild, senescence patterns in species for which population dynamics assessments are crucial, such as translocated populations, remain virtually unexplored. Based on a 15-year nest survey of a North-African Houbara bustard population in Morocco, we investigated age variation in the breeding performance of captive-bred females released in the wild. We identified 781 females, from 1 to 10 years of age, on 1094 nests. We examined how age influenced nest initiation date, clutch size, egg volume, daily nest survival and daily brood survival, as well as whether age-dependent patterns varied according to environmental conditions. Most breeding parameters exhibited variation, suggesting an increase in breeding performance with age in young females (those from 1 to 3 years old). In older females (> 78 years old), the egg volume and clutch size decreased with age, in concordance with expectations from senescence theories and previous empirical results obtained from captive Houbara bustards. Finally, our analysis uncovered a significant interaction between age and the amount of precipitation prior to the breeding season on clutch size, suggesting differential abilities of females of different ages to increase their breeding investment. Our study suggests that life histories in translocated individuals are not affected by translocation protocols and provides insights for implementing age dependencies in population viability assessments.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.08.023","Williams","Williams_721",241,0.148497969280076,0.131755244118687,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Terrestrial species typically become stranded in post-isolation land-bridge islands within hydroelectric reservoirs. Understanding the resulting extinction dynamics of insular communities is critical to inform, if not to avert, the ongoing blitzkrieg of dam development. Here we assess the effects of forest patch and landscape metrics on diurnal lizard species richness and composition within the Balbina Hydroelectric Dam and surrounding areas in the Central Brazilian Amazon. This 28-yr-old dam created a reservoir of ~ 4438 km2, comprising 3546 islands. We sampled 25 of these islands (0.831466 ha) and five mainland continuous forest sites, one of which placed along stream banks. We further related morpho-ecological traits and the geographic distribution of lizard species to the spatial metrics of islands where they occurred. Using 100 L-pitfall traps operated over 5447 trap-days, we recorded 1123 lizards from 17 taxa, two of which exclusively found along stream banks within continuous forest. Island area was the best predictor of species richness and composition. Small islands (= 2 ha) harboured fewer than a third of all species typically observed in larger islands and continuous forest (= 8 species), and only islands = 100 ha retained nearly complete lizard faunas. Lizard assemblages inhabiting small, isolated islands consisted almost exclusively of an oversimplified set of widely distributed, large-bodied, habitat generalist, heliophile species associated with open areas and forest edges, and that feed on a wide spectrum of prey sizes. These wholesale changes in lizard community structure were characterized by severe losses in functional traits, and may profoundly affect ecosystem functioning.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.08.002","Williams","Williams_722",258,0.17270739968852,-0.0159762014927472,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
727,2017,"Measuring the effectiveness of protected area management by comparing   habitat utilization and threat dynamics","Biological Conservation","The conservation outcomes of a protected area depend on management actions. The effectiveness of protected area management remains a concern for donors and policy-makers. However, very few feasible methods assessing the ability and performance of management teams have been developed. Behavioral shifts in habitat usage, direct and sensitive wildlife responses to threats, have been ignored in the evaluation of protected area management. To address the technical limitations, we developed a method that uses the behavioral dynamics of target species as indicators of the efficacy of threat reduction, control, and overall management effort. By comparing wildlife behavior with threat avoidance distances and patterns we can examine threat mitigation efficacy as a proxy for overall reserve management effectiveness. Using evidence of giant panda habitat utilization in eleven reserves across Qinling Mountains from 2000 to 2012, we built a model of behavior based on the avoidance of four types of anthropogenic threat. We stratified the eleven reserves into five efficacies, of which Changqing reserve was deemed to have the highest management effectiveness. Our approach was validated and supported by changes in suitable habitat and population size across reserves. Focusing on the end result of all threats and management effort means that our framework is straightforward for reserve staff to implement, produces easily interpreted results, and is worthy of application. This study highlights the value of behavioral dynamics when making a full and scientific assessment of the effectiveness of protected area management, and helps investors and policy-makers realize the efficacy of conservation inputs.","10.1016/j.biocon.2017.04.027","Williams","Williams_727",249,0.300387444300122,0.297512858509363,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

We measured source populations of these exotics in the St. Lawrence River and found population densities of dreissenids (range of ~1,000-6,400 individuals m -2) and round gobies (6-32 individuals m -2) similar to those in other Great Lake locations from which they have spread inland. However, we found little evidence for their secondary invasion of inland tributary rivers and lakes of northern New York State. Using natural waters collected from inland ecosystems, we ran laboratory bioassays of reproduction, growth, and survival of several life stages of zebra and quagga mussels as well as the round goby. We found little difference in the responses of zebra and quagga mussels, with each species showing moderate reproductive success, growth, and survival at Ca concentrations > 13 mg L -1 and dramatic improvements at >18 mg L -1. Round gobies showed moderate survival in waters with Ca concentrations > 8 mg L -1 and high survival > 18 mg L -1. These bioassays are the first such experiments for quagga mussels and round gobies and show how all three species may be similarly restricted in their ability to invade and permanently colonize significant geographic regions of New York State and perhaps the US. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10530-011-0146-0","Williams","Williams_763",228,0.252319772276755,0.284695285315736,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
773,2017,"Relative leaping abilities of native versus invasive cyprinids as   criteria for selective barrier design","Biological Invasions","Restoration of river connectivity favors the spread of native but also of exotic invasive populations, mainly freshwater fish. This has rarely been studied, and never between migrating cyprinids. To harmonize both objectives, the feasibility of a selective leaping barrier for migratory cyprinids is studied through the measurement of fish leaping capabilities while freely migrating at a weir in the Guadiana River of southwest Spain. A cross-population analysis provided the cost-benefit outcomes of completely blocking the invasive Carassius auratus while allowing negotiation for most of the native Luciobarbus sp. populations. Larger fish reached higher leap heights, the highest being attained by the native barbel species. Barbels reached up to four times its total length and a maximum height of approximately 150 cm, while the figures for the invasive goldfish were double total length with a maximum of approximately 80 cm. The selective obstacle height (SOH) for goldfish was 81.2 cm, the estimated maximum height that the tip of a jumping goldfish could reach. Facility designs (whether culvert, weir or fish pass) with this SOH criterion guarantees complete migration failure of goldfish. Also, most (9599%) of the barbels migrating populations will surpass the SOH regardless of body length; only the less capable or those in poor condition will be blocked. Advice on SOH utility to evaluate existing instream structuresand their position within the cost-benefit balanceis provided.","10.1007/s10530-016-1328-6","Williams","Williams_773",225,0.199218295352569,0.0156405488120896,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
810,2012,"Breeding biology and population increase of the Endangered Bermuda   Petrel Pterodroma cahow","Bird Conservation International","The Bermuda Petrel Pterodroma cahow was thought to have become extinct early in the 17 th century due to a combination of hunting by human colonists and predation by introduced rats, cats, dogs and pigs. However, single individuals were found on four occasions during the first half of the 20 th century, and in 1951 a small population was discovered breeding on several rocky islets in north-east Bermuda. Recovery actions began in 1962 when the population numbered just 18 pairs, dispersed among five small islets. Although rats extirpated one of these five colonies in 1967, the population has grown steadily to 56 breeding pairs in 2000. We investigated the breeding phenology, productivity and population size of the Bermuda Petrel between 2000/2001 and 2007/2008. Each year, the birds began arriving in Bermuda around mid-October. They departed on a pre-breeding exodus between 19 November and 14 December, returning after 32-56 days to lay a single egg between 31 December and 31 January. Eggs hatched from 16 February to 26 March after a mean (± SD) incubation period of 53 ± 2 days, and young fledged from 15 May to 25 June after a mean fledging period of 91 ± 5 days. Between 2000/2001 and 2007/2008, reproductive output ranged from 29 to 40 fledglings per annum. Mean annual breeding success (62%) was reasonably high relative to other Procellariiformes, largely due to the provision of artificial (concrete) nesting burrows. In 2008, the population numbered 85 breeding pairs. Monitoring since 1961 indicates the population has been increasing exponentially, doubling approximately every 22 years. This rate of increase, together with the increased incidence of storm damage, is making it progressively more impracticable to construct sufficient concrete burrows on the current nesting islets to accommodate all breeding pairs. The vulnerability of these sites to accelerating storm damage and erosion as a result of anthropomorphic climate change is now the greatest threat to the Bermuda Petrel. © Copyright BirdLife International 2012.","10.1017/S0959270911000396","Williams","Williams_810",289,0.252267322644109,0.0639365201576359,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
811,2012,"The economic cost of seabird bycatch in Argentinean longline fisheries","Bird Conservation International","Seabird mortality in longline fisheries is believed to be an important cause of the reductions in many seabird populations worldwide, and results in reduced fishing efficiency and economic losses for fishing companies. We estimated the economic cost of not using seabird bycatch deterrents in Argentinean longline fisheries, with the intention of encouraging adoption of mitigation measures in those fisheries. We conducted the study in the Argentine ling Genypterus blacodes and Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides fisheries from 2001 to 2006 on three fishing vessels. Data on the incidence of seabird bycatch were collected by seabird observers specially trained in seabird identification and data on the catch rates of target species, cost of bait and fish were provided by the fishing company, supervised by Federal Inspectors from the Provincial Fisheries Agency. To estimate the bait loss, we set lines both with and without the use of deterrents (streamer lines, night setting and strategic discharge of offal) in both fisheries. Seabird bycatch varies temporally and geographically, so to estimate economic losses using deterrents in each fishery, we used different bycatch rates/1000 hooks registered for different periods and fishing areas. Bycatch rates in the absence of deterrents were two birds/1000 hooks and 1.53 birds/1000 hooks for the Patagonian toothfish and ling fisheries, respectively. These rates equate to the loss of more than 1.5 and 2 million dollars over a 10 year period for each fishery. When estimations are made with lower mortality rates, economic losses declined abruptly and were in the order of hundreds of dollars/fishing trip, for the same period of time. Results show that using deterrents, long term profits for the fishing company increase at a considerably high rate (the decrease in monetary loss is an order of magnitude), and the mortality of seabirds decreases by the same proportion (CPUE of seabirds decreases from tens of thousands to a few hundred). In these fisheries, the use of mitigation measures that reduce bait loss and seabird mortality represents a win-win situation with benefits to conservation and fishing companies. © Copyright BirdLife International 2011.","10.1017/S0959270911000219","Williams","Williams_811",334,0.194097345460464,-0.0927270582038826,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

In an environment under a high level of threat, the high breeding site fidelity (or breeding site persistence) of this species enables long term monitoring of colony site occupancy, colony size and other breeding parameters, which provide multiple indicators of population status. We surveyed known colony sites and searched for new sites in three recent breeding seasons in order to assess the current population status in the most important part of their range in Sierra Leone, the Gola Forest. We found 157 active nests at 40 colonies, equating to at least 314 adult birds. Less than half of the known colonies were protected by the Gola Forest Reserve. Colonies outside the reserve tended to be confined to larger rocks and subject to disturbance from human activities in close proximity, but did not have fewer active nests in them. Colonies outside the reserve were also more likely to be inactive in a given year whereas all colonies inside the reserve were active in every survey year. A predictive distribution model indicated that the survey region could have as many as 234 nests equating to at least 468 breeding birds. There was no evidence that mean colony size had declined since surveys undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s but it was not possible to compare colony abandonment rates inside and outside the reserve over that time period. Clutch and brood sizes were similar in each year, though brood size appeared slightly lower in the third survey year possibly because of a slightly later survey date. Mean clutch and brood sizes reported during the study period were similar to those found in the 1980s and 1990s. We conclude that the population of White-necked Picathartes in the Gola Forest area has been relatively stable over the last two decades, reflecting both the efficacy of protection afforded by the Gola Forest Reserve and presumably low pressure to farm new areas in the nearby community forest. However, regular monitoring of colonies both inside and outside the reserve is required to detect any systematic impact on the birds as pressure for land increases. © 2011 BirdLife International.","10.1017/S0959270911000220","Williams","Williams_812",365,0.26797401783392,0.0983621471715111,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Recently, overall forest cover in Vietnam has increased, but most of the increase has been attributed to plantations of non-native trees. The conservation value of these plantations for birds is unknown. We compared avian species richness in pine plantations to that in second-growth and mature native forests in Tam Dao National Park, Vietnam. Bird species were classified into two categories: forest specialists or forest generalists. To account for strong heterogeneity in detection probabilities, the number of species in each category was estimated using the Pledger-Huggins estimator. We estimated total species richness and number of forest specialist species to be highest in mature forest (191; 95% CI = 96, 287, and 88; 95% CI = 47, 129 respectively), lower in second-growth forest (158; 95% CI = 87, 245 and 58; 95% CI = 18, 98 respectively), and lowest in pine plantation (106; 95% CI = 52, 158 and 49; 95% CI = 2, 97 respectively).

Three main wintering regions were identified: the Moghan Plain in the north-west of the country, the Turkmen Sahra Plain at the south-east corner of the Caspian Sea and the Sarakhs Plain in the north-east, close to the Afghan border. Up to 10,050 individuals were counted in winter 2009 in the Moghan Plain, which was recognised as the most important area for wintering Little Bustards in Iran. The species was also found in good numbers in Miankaleh, Gomishan, Soufikam, Shour Lake and Sarakhs. Flocks comprising 51 to 500 individuals were the most commonly observed and represented 32% of occurrences. A marked increase in wintering population size was noted in recent years. The main wintering period in Iran extends from November to February. At a national scale, we estimated the Iranian wintering population of Little Bustards at 5,000-10,000 individuals.

The most important foraging habitat during the entire breeding season was grassland (especially pastures) reaching 90% for all locations. Vegetation height and cover were the main factors determining habitat selection: Little Owls significantly preferred sparse and short sward vegetation patches that enabled hunting of ground-dwelling prey.

Here we compare nesting success of the Reed Parrotbill Paradoxornis heudei in annually harvested and non-harvested reedbed habitats in the Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve in China, by recording the number of nestlings produced per nest and the causes of nest failure. We modelled daily nest survival rate (DSR) by considering the effects of harvesting, vegetation characteristics, year, date, advancement within the breeding season, nest age and nearest-nest distance, using the program MARK. Nest densities, but not the number of fledglings per nest, were significantly lower in harvested than non-harvested reedbed habitats. The best-fit DSR model estimated constant survival; none of the tested co-variables had significant effects. Moreover, harvesting did not affect the date of breeding initiation, likelihood of nest failure, or causes of nest failure, as vegetation cover was not significantly different between harvested and non-harvested reedbeds during the whole breeding season. Nest failure following adverse weather conditions was unusually common in harvested and non-harvested reedbeds, accounting for as many nest failures as depredation. However, comparisons with other studies suggest that deriving a conclusion on the impact of harvesting on nesting success is not straightforward and is probably linked to environmental characteristics affecting reed growth. © 2011 BirdLife International.","10.1017/S0959270911000384","Williams","Williams_817",222,0.406405104649021,0.0705302600259418,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

We studied the nesting requirements of the Tucuman Parrot and assessed cavity availability, reuse, and spatial pattern of nests in El Rey National Park-one of the last mature, undisturbed areas of the Southern Yungas forest. We recorded 44 nesting attempts in seven tree species, with most nests (95%) being located in live canopy trees > 60 cm DBH. Most parrot nest-cavities occurred in Blepharocalix salicifolius (60%) and cavities in this species were selected significantly more than expected based on availability. Nests were shallower and higher than nests of other Amazona species. For all years combined, mean nest density of Tucuman Parrot was 0.24 ± 0.04 nest ha-1 and the distance to the nearest active nest was significantly greater than the distance between all trees used as nests. Nesting pairs of Tucuman Parrot were separated by 144.1 ± 152.8 m, while potential nest-trees were 66.0 ± 55.4 m apart. Density of suitable cavities for nesting was 4.6 cavities ha-1. Approximately 16 suitable cavities were available for each breeding pair (0.24 breeding pair ha-1 and four suitable cavities ha-1) and 5% of the suitable cavities available were occupied, suggesting that suitable cavities are not a limiting resource. However, due to the territorial behaviour of breeding pairs, some of these cavities are unavailable to other breeding pairs.

Using systematic migration counts from multiple localities in the southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, as well as observations of their flight trajectories during eight consecutive years (2007-2014), we describe the magnitude of these movements, their geographic extent, and the phenology of the most abundant species in both spring and fall seasons. The most abundant species were Turkey Vulture Cathartes aura, Swainson's Hawk Buteo swainsoni, Broad-winged Hawk Buteo platypterus, Wood Stork Mycteria americana, American White Pelican Pelecanus erythrothynchos, Franklin's Gull Leucophaeus pipixcan, and American Kestrel Falco sparverius. In spring, the seasonal average magnitude of migration was over 28,000 birds, while in autumn the average was over one million. The aggregated seasonal phenologies recorded illustrate a variety of migration patterns. The inter-annual variation is lower in autumn than in spring. Migrating raptors and other soaring birds did not seem to use any topographical feature as a leading line for their movements in spring, while in autumn they did. We estimated the main axis of spring flights to run along a SE-NW vector, while autumn migration follows a WNW-ESE general trajectory. Our results place the isthmus as one of the five most important sites in the world for raptors and soaring migrants. Sustaining annual migration counts at these sites is of high importance to track substantial portions (> 90%) of the global population of Turkey Vulture and Swainson's Hawk, as well as over 10% of the global population of Broad-winged Hawk.

822,2017,"Volunteer survey effort for high-profile species can benefit   conservation of non-focal species","Bird Conservation International","Summary The last irrefutable record of the Critically Endangered Slender-billed Curlew Numenius tenuirostris came from 1995. The range of the species is poorly known, but between 2009 and 2011, volunteer observers surveyed more than 680 sites in 19 countries, with additional search effort in a further 12 countries. Although there were no definite sightings (two birds that might have been Slender-billed Curlew were reported), there were other benefits. These included increased knowledge of species distributions and populations in seldom visited areas (over 500,000 birds of over 400 species were observed), the identification of threats to at least 10 Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, the identification of sites that could qualify as Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, and capacity building and education through involvement with local survey teams and observers and finally recommendations for future surveys. Thus, these surveys demonstrate the potential benefits of volunteer field surveys for non-focal species.","10.1017/S0959270916000186","Williams","Williams_822",143,0.253015281107646,0.279367853233485,"150","neutral","neutral_150",0
823,2017,"The importance of protected and unprotected areas for colony occupancy   and colony size in White-necked Picathartes Picathartes gymnocephalus in   and around Gola Rainforest National Park, Sierra Leone","Bird Conservation International","Summary Most attention on tropical biodiversity conservation has focussed on protected areas. Recognising and enhancing the value of biodiversity outside, as well as inside, protected areas is increasingly important given recognition that biodiversity targets will not be met through protected areas alone. We investigated the extent to which protection influences colony occupancy and colony size of a species of conservation concern, the rock-nesting White-necked Picathartes Picathartes gymnocephalus. We used mixed models to compare long term trends at 42 colonies located both inside and outside a protected area of forest, Gola Rainforest National Park, and considered colonies further inside the boundary as being better protected. Colony occupation was primarily predicted by the level of protection, with occupation highest within protected areas, but was not different between colonies situated close to or far from the boundary. Mean colony occupation was consistently high in protected areas, and lower in unprotected areas. The surface area of colony rocks was also an important predictor with larger rock faces having a higher probability of occupancy. Our best models also included distance to forested habitat, presence of cleared forest and evidence of hunting as less important predictors. Over the eight-year study, after controlling for rock surface area, active colony size declined significantly. However, declines were only significant in colonies in unprotected forest, whilst colonies located within protected areas were buffered from significant decline. Together this suggests colony occupancy and the number of active nests are influenced by protection and human disturbance. Although a lack of demographic and population dynamic work on picathartes prevents identifying mechanisms, we show that despite unprotected colonies having lower occupancy and fewer active nests they can persist in human altered and disturbed areas, partly because larger traditionally used rocks remain important nesting sites.","10.1017/S0959270916000113","Williams","Williams_823",292,0.38282074621977,0.256501588654217,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
824,2017,"Ruddy-headed Goose Chloephaga rubidiceps: former plague and present   protected species on the edge of extinction","Bird Conservation International","Summary The Ruddy-headed Goose Chloephaga rubidiceps has two separate and genetically distinct populations, one sedentary that inhabits the Malvinas/Falklands Islands and another migratory, which inhabits continental southern South America. New information suggests that these populations should be considered as different evolutionarily significant units. The latter population breeds in Austral Patagonia (Argentina and Chile) and overwinters in Central Argentina. It was a very common species in Austral Magellanic steppe grasslands before 1931, when it was declared an agricultural pest by the Argentinian government, together with other sheldgeese species. Since then, the continental Ruddy-headed Goose population has declined becoming one of the scarcest species in Austral Magellanic steppe. Nowadays, its population is categorised as critically endangered in Argentina and endangered in Chile. We present data from six road censuses conducted in the breeding areas of Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego provinces, Argentina, during 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 (>4600 km, 70 days) and review population trends of the Ruddy-headed Goose since the early 1900s. We counted a maximum of 19 individuals in Santa Cruz and 49 in Tierra del Fuego throughout the breeding season. A literature review indicates that during the last 40 years the size of continental population of Ruddy-headed Goose has been < 800 individuals, approximately 10% of the estimated population in the 1900s. This decline matches the period following the application of control techniques and the introduction of exotic predator species in the breeding grounds of Tierra del Fuego. We review and discuss formerly proposed conservation actions that may have a positive and rapid effect on sheldgoose numbers recovery. We suggest that the continental population of Ruddy-headed Goose should on a precautionary basis be treated as a critically endangered population until genetic studies determine whether we are in the presence of a new 'Critically Endangered' species.","10.1017/S0959270916000101","Williams","Williams_824",291,0.277883141274936,0.00245276185023754,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
825,2017,"Effect of landscape variables on the long-term decline of Great Argus in   the rainforest of Southern Thailand","Bird Conservation International","Summary In Thailand, as for most of South-East Asia, large vertebrates are declining rapidly due to habitat degradation and increasing hunting pressure. Once relatively common in the evergreen forest of Southern Thailand, the Great Argus Argusianus argus is currently limited to a few populations, whose status is currently unknown. In this study we investigated changes in Great Argus abundance over the past 13 years in Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary. Our aim was to estimate and compare the abundance and density of this species from an earlier two-year survey in 2001-2002 and ours in 2014, and to assess the effect of landscape change on its status of the species. We conducted surveys from March to August 2014 during the breeding season. We placed point counts that overlapped the line transects from the 2001-2002 survey. The results indicated a decline of > 35% in mean abundance from 2001 to 2014. In addition, male abundance has shifted and is now positively related to distance from the forest edge. High levels of human disturbance close to the forest edge may have resulted in the birds moving to the core of the forest, suggesting a need to increase protection and management of forest edge areas. In common with other studies of large vertebrates, our results confirm the importance of long-term studies to highlight the negative effects of human disturbance.","10.1017/S0959270916000277","Williams","Williams_825",218,0.221876760899306,0.0818838566738457,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Surveys of waterbirds at three sites on the coast of southern Jiangsu Province, China, in 2014 and 2015 produced peak counts of international importance for 24 species, including seven globally threatened and six Near Threatened species. The area is of particular global importance for the 'Critically Endangered' Spoon-billed Sandpiper Calidris pygmaea (peak count across all three study sites: 62 in spring [2015] and 225 in autumn [2014] and 'Endangered' Spotted Greenshank Tringa guttifer (peak count across all three study sites: 210 in spring [2014] and 1,110 in autumn [2015]). The southern Jiangsu coast is therefore currently the most important migratory stopover area in the world, in both spring and autumn, for both species. Several serious and acute threats to waterbirds were recorded at these study sites. Paramount is the threat of large-scale land claim which would completely destroy intertidal mudflats of critical importance to waterbirds. Degradation of intertidal mudflat habitats through the spread of invasive Spartina, and mortality of waterbirds by entrapment in nets or deliberate poisoning are also real and present serious threats here. Collisions with, and displacement by, wind turbines and other structures, and industrial chemical pollution may represent additional potential threats. We recommend the rapid establishment of effective protected areas for waterbirds in the study area, maintaining large areas of open intertidal mudflat, and the urgent removal of all serious threats currently faced by waterbirds here.","10.1017/S0959270917000223","Williams","Williams_826",251,0.501841140357053,0.0328151734625125,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
827,2017,"Atlas data indicate forest dependent bird species declines in South   Africa","Bird Conservation International","Forest ecosystems in South Africa are at risk from a variety of anthropogenic threats impacting the faunal species dependent on them. These impacts often differ depending on species-specific characteristics. Range data on forest dependent bird species from the South African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP1 and SABAP2) were analysed to determine links between deforestation, species characteristics and range declines. Half of the species studied were found to have declining ranges. Range change data for these species were correlated with data on changes in land cover from 1990 to 2014. To determine which land cover changes affect extinction, occupancy was modelled for 30 sites across South Africa which experienced a loss of more than 10 species. Most species lost were birds of prey or insectivores. Indigenous forest decreased in 17% (n = 5) sites, while plantations/woodlots decreased in 60% (n = 18) sites. Occupancy modelling showed extinction to be mitigated by plantations in 6/28 species, and forest expansion mitigated extinction in 7/28 species. Responses to deforestation did not appear to be related to particular species characteristics. Half of South Africa's forest-dependent bird species have declining ranges, with the loss of these species most prominent in the Eastern Cape province. Four responses to changes in forest and plantation cover are discussed: direct effects, with forest loss causing species loss; matrix effects, where plantation loss resulted in species loss; degradation of indigenous forest; and the advent of new forest arising from woody thickening caused by carbon fertilisation, which may not result in optimal habitat for forest-dependent birds.","10.1017/S095927091600040X","Williams","Williams_827",245,0.210533678649967,-0.191535688606552,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
829,2017,"On the brink: status and breeding ecology of Eleonora's Falcon Falco   eleonorae in Algeria","Bird Conservation International","This is the first study reporting the population status and reproductive biology of the Eleonoras Falcon in Algeria. To determine the status, nest site selection, and breeding parameters, data were collected at Chetaïbi, north-east Algeria in 2010 and 2012. During this period, the number of breeding pairs decreased from 130 to 100, which represents an annual decrease rate of 12.29%. The mean clutch size was 2.6 ± 0.5 (n = 90) and 2.9 ± 0.4 (n = 34) in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Clutches displayed a low rate of hatching (56% and 41%) and productivity decreased from 0.8 chicks/nest in 2010 to 0.4 chicks/nest in 2012. Breeding outcome and productivity were negatively related to sun exposure and were weakly linked to hatching date in 2012 but not in 2010. Although fluctuations in population size have been reported across the species breeding range, our results suggest that the Algerian population of Eleonoras Falcon is experiencing a sharp decline in recent times that also involves the near extinction of a small neighbouring colony. Apart from the effect of environmental factors on breeding performance, this negative population trend is likely to be explained by increasing anthropogenic pressures associated with an upsurge of recreational activities on and around the island as well as the introduction of mammal predators. Active management across the country is urgently needed to mitigate such pressures and ensure the long-term persistence of a bird listed as a priority species for conservation.","10.1017/S0959270916000484","Williams","Williams_829",222,0.188886297345463,0.161349411902556,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
862,2012,"Population Dynamics of Hawaiian Seabird Colonies Vulnerable to Sea-Level   Rise","Conservation Biology","Globally, seabirds are vulnerable to anthropogenic threats both at sea and on land. Seabirds typically nest colonially and show strong fidelity to natal colonies, and such colonies on low-lying islands may be threatened by sea-level rise. We used French Frigate Shoals, the largest atoll in the Hawaiian Archipelago, as a case study to explore the population dynamics of seabird colonies and the potential effects sea-level rise may have on these rookeries. We compiled historic observations, a 30-year time series of seabird population abundance, lidar-derived elevations, and aerial imagery of all the islands of French Frigate Shoals. To estimate the population dynamics of 8 species of breeding seabirds on Tern Island from 1980 to 2009, we used a Gompertz model with a Bayesian approach to infer population growth rates, density dependence, process variation, and observation error. All species increased in abundance, in a pattern that provided evidence of density dependence. Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor), Masked Boobies (Sula dactylatra), Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda), Spectacled Terns (Onychoprion lunatus), and White Terns (Gygis alba) are likely at carrying capacity. Density dependence may exacerbate the effects of sea-level rise on seabirds because populations near carrying capacity on an island will be more negatively affected than populations with room for growth. We projected 12% of French Frigate Shoals will be inundated if sea level rises 1 m and 28% if sea level rises 2 m. Spectacled Terns and shrub-nesting species are especially vulnerable to sea-level rise, but seawalls and habitat restoration may mitigate the effects of sea-level rise. Losses of seabird nesting habitat may be substantial in the Hawaiian Islands by 2100 if sea levels rise 2 m. Restoration of higher-elevation seabird colonies represent a more enduring conservation solution for Pacific seabirds. Conservation Biology © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.

Monitoring can also be used to inform law enforcement and managers of where hunting is concentrated. We evaluated the effects of law enforcement informed by monitoring data on density and spatial distribution of 8 monkey species in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. We conducted intensive surveys of monkeys and looked for signs of human activity throughout the park. We also gathered information on the activities of law-enforcement personnel related to hunting and evaluated the relative effects of hunting, forest cover and proximity to rivers, and conservation effort on primate distribution and density. The effects of hunting on monkeys varied among species. Red colobus monkeys (Procolobus badius) were most affected and Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli) were least affected by hunting. Density of monkeys irrespective of species was up to 100 times higher near a research station and tourism site in the southwestern section of the park, where there is little hunting, than in the southeastern part of the park.

We evaluated the trade-off among sustainable food production, profitability, and conservation objectives in the groundfish bottom-trawl fishery off the U.S. West Coast, where depletion (i.e., reduction in abundance) of six rockfish species (Sebastes) is of particular concern. Trade-offs are inherent in this multispecies fishery because there is limited capacity to target species individually. From population models and catch of 34 stocks of bottom fish, we calculated the relation between harvest rate, long-term yield (i.e., total weight of fish caught), profit, and depletion of each species. In our models, annual ecosystem-wide yield from all 34 stocks was maximized with an overall 5.4% harvest rate, but profit was maximized at a 2.8% harvest rate. When we reduced harvest rates to the level (2.2% harvest rate) at which no stocks collapsed ( 30% of total sustainable yield, whereas yield lost from stock depletion was 3% of total sustainable yield.

To date,uncertain sightings have been treated in an ad hoc way, either excluding them from the record or including them as if they were certain. We developed a Bayesian method that formally accounts for such uncertain sightings. The method assumes that valid and invalid sightings follow independent Poisson processes and use noninformative prior distributions for the rate of valid sightings and for a measure of the quality of uncertain sightings. We applied the method to a recently published record of sightings of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker(Campephilus principalis).This record covers the period 1897-2010 and contains 39 sightings classified as certain and 29 classified as uncertain. The Bayes factor in favor of extinction was 4.03,which constitutes substantial support for extinction. The posterior distribution of the time of extinction has 3 main modes in 1944,1952,and 1988.

In doing so, they allow one to identify influential nodes that are not well studied empirically so that future research can be prioritized. We identified relationships in host and pathogen biology to examine disease-driven declines of amphibians associated with amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). We constructed a Bayesian network consisting of behavioral, genetic, physiological, and environmental variables that influence disease and used them to predict host population trends. We varied the impacts of specific variables in the model to reveal factors with the most influence on host population trend. The behavior of the nodes (the way in which the variables probabilistically responded to changes in states of the parents, which are the nodes or variables that directly influenced them in the graphical model) was consistent with published results. The frog population had a 49% probability of decline when all states were set at their original values, and this probability increased when body temperatures were cold, the immune system was not suppressing infection, and the ambient environment was conducive to growth of B. dendrobatidis. These findings suggest the construction of our model reflected the complex relationships characteristic of hostpathogen interactions. Changes to climatic variables alone did not strongly influence the probability of population decline, which suggests that climate interacts with other factors such as the capacity of the frog immune system to suppress disease. Changes to the adaptive immune system and disease reservoirs had a large effect on the population trend, but there was little empirical information available for model construction. Our model inputs can be used as a base to examine other systems, and our results show that such analyses are useful tools for reviewing existing literature, identifying links poorly supported by evidence, and understanding complexities in emerging infectious-disease systems.","10.1111/cobi.12950","Williams","Williams_870",317,0.302724666661608,0.0956063051025209,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Studies on seafood fraud often report high rates of mislabeling (e.g., >70%), but these studies have been limited to a single sampling year, which means it is difficult to assess the impact of stricter governmental truth-in-labeling regulations. We used DNA barcoding to assess seafood labeling in 26 sushi restaurants in Los Angeles over 4 years. Seafood from 3 high-end grocery stores were also sampled (n = 16) in 2014. We ordered 9 common sushi fish from menus, preserved tissue samples in 95% ethanol, extracted the genomic DNA, amplified and sequenced a portion of the mtDNA COI gene, and identified the resulting sequence to known fish sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information nucleotide database. We compared DNA results with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) list of acceptable market names and retail names. We considered sushi-sample labels that were inconsistent with FDA names mislabeled. Sushi restaurants had a consistently high percentage of mislabeling (47%; 151 of 323) from 2012 to 2015, yet mislabeling was not homogenous across species. Halibut, red snapper, yellowfin tuna, and yellowtail had consistently high ( 15%). All sampled sushi restaurants had at least one case of mislabeling.

874,2017,"Trait-based prediction of extinction risk of small-bodied freshwater   fishes","Conservation Biology","Small body size is generally correlated with r-selected life-history traits, including early maturation, short-generation times, and rapid growth rates, that result in high population turnover and a reduced risk of extinction. Unlike other classes of vertebrates, however, small freshwater fishes appear to have an equal or greater risk of extinction than large fishes. We explored whether particular traits explain the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List conservation status of small-bodied freshwater fishes from 4 temperate river basins: Murray-Darling, Australia; Danube, Europe; Mississippi-Missouri, North America; and the Rio Grande, North America. Twenty-three ecological and life-history traits were collated for all 171 freshwater fishes of =120 mm total length. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to assess which combination of the 23 traits best explained whether a species was threatened or not threatened. We used the best models to predict the probability of 29 unclassified species being listed as threatened. With and without controlling for phylogeny at the family level, small body sizeamong small-bodied specieswas the most influential trait correlated with threatened species listings. The k-folds cross-validation demonstrated that body size and a random effect structure that included family predicted the threat status with an accuracy of 78% (SE 0.5). We identified 10 species likely to be threatened that are not listed as such on the IUCN Red List. Small body size is not a trait that provides universal resistance to extinction, particularly for vertebrates inhabiting environments affected by extreme habitat loss and fragmentation. We hypothesize that this is because small-bodied species have smaller home ranges, lower dispersal capabilities, and heightened ecological specialization relative to larger vertebrates. Trait data and further model development are needed to predict the IUCN conservation status of the over 11,000 unclassified freshwater fishes, especially those under threat from proposed dam construction in the world's most biodiverse river basins.","10.1111/cobi.12882","Williams","Williams_874",310,0.173499915485075,0.059248527110973,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
875,2017,"Desert pastoralists' negative and positive effects on rare wildlife in   the Gobi","Conservation Biology","In arid regions of the developing world, pastoralists and livestock commonly inhabit protected areas, resulting in humanwildlife conflict. Conflict is inextricably linked to the ecological processes shaping relationships between pastoralists and native herbivores and carnivores. To elucidate relationships underpinning humanwildlife conflict, we synthesized 15 years of ecological and ethnographic data from Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in Mongolia's Gobi steppe. The density of argali (Ovis ammon), the world's largest wild sheep, at Ikh Nart was among the highest in Mongolia, yet livestock were >90% of ungulate biomass and dogs >90% of large-carnivore biomass. For argali, pastoral activities decreased food availability, increased mortality from dog predation, and potentially increased disease risk. Isotope analyses indicated that livestock accounted for >50% of the diet of the majority of gray wolves (Canis lupus) and up to 90% of diet in 25% of sampled wolves (n = 8). Livestock composed at least 96% of ungulate prey in the single wolf pack for which we collected species-specific prey data. Interviews with pastoralists indicated that wolves annually killed 14% of Ikh Nart's livestock, and pastoralists killed wolves in retribution. Pastoralists reduced wolf survival by killing them, but their livestock were an abundant food source for wolves. Consequently, wolf density appeared to be largely decoupled from argali density, and pastoralists had indirect effects on argali that could be negative if pastoralists increased wolf density (apparent competition) or positive if pastoralists decreased wolf predation (apparent facilitation). Ikh Nart's argali population was stable despite these threats, but livestock are increasingly dominant numerically and functionally relative to argali. To support both native wildlife and pastoral livelihoods, we suggest training dogs to not kill argali, community insurance against livestock losses to wolves, reintroducing key native prey species to hotspots of humanwolf conflict, and developing incentives for pastoralists to reduce livestock density.","10.1111/cobi.12881","Williams","Williams_875",293,0.183300946784407,-0.0850136250226418,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Although intact primary forests harbor many Himalayan birds during breeding, a large number of bird species use agricultural lands during winter. We assessed how Himalayan bird species richness, abundance, and composition during winter are affected by forest loss stemming from agriculture and grazing. Bird surveys along 12 elevational transects within primary forest, low-intensity agriculture, mixed subsistence agriculture, and intensively grazed pastures in winter revealed that bird species richness and abundance were greatest in low-intensity and mixed agriculture, intermediate in grazed pastures, and lowest in primary forest at both local and landscape scales; over twice as many species and individuals were recorded in low-intensity agriculture than in primary forest. Bird communities in primary forests were distinct from those in all other land-use classes, but only 4 species were unique to primary forests. Low-, medium-, and high-intensity agriculture harbored 32 unique species. Of the species observed in primary forest, 80% had equal or greater abundance in low-intensity agricultural lands, underscoring the value of these lands in retaining diverse community assemblages at high densities in winter. Among disturbed landscapes, bird species richness and abundance declined as land-use intensity increased, especially in high-intensity pastures. Our results suggest that agricultural landscapes are important for most Himalayan bird species in winter. But agricultural intensificationespecially increased grazingwill likely result in biodiversity losses. Given that forest reserves alone may inadequately conserve Himalayan birds in winter, comprehensive conservation strategies in the region must go beyond protecting intact primary forests and ensure that low-intensity agricultural lands are not extensively converted to high-intensity pastures.","10.1111/cobi.12812","Williams","Williams_877",286,0.234845316673384,0.292720101306202,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
910,2012,"Population structure and landscape genetics in the endangered   subterranean rodent Ctenomys porteousi","Conservation Genetics","In order to devise adequate conservation and management strategies for endangered species, it is important to incorporate a reliable understanding of its spatial population structure, detecting the existence of demographic partitions throughout its geographical range and characterizing the distribution of its genetic diversity. Moreover, in species that occupy fragmented habitats it is essential to know how landscape characteristics may affect the genetic connectivity among populations. In this study we use eight microsatellite markers to analyze population structure and gene flow patterns in the complete geographic range of the endangered rodent Ctenomys porteousi. Also, we use landscape genetics approaches to evaluate the effects of landscape configuration on the genetic connectivity among populations. In spite of geographical proximity of the sampling sites (8-27 km between the nearest sites) and the absence of marked barriers to individual movement, strong population structure and low values of gene flow were observed. Genetic differentiation among sampling sites was consistent with a simple model of isolation by distance, where peripheral areas showed higher population differentiation than those sites located in the central area of the species' distribution. Landscape genetics analysis suggested that habitat fragmentation at regional level has affected the distribution of genetic variation among populations. The distance of sampling sites to areas of the landscape having higher habitat connectivity was the environmental factor most strongly related to population genetic structure. In general, our results indicate strong genetic structure in C. porteousi, even at a small spatial scale, and suggest that habitat fragmentation could increase the population differentiation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10592-011-0273-2","Williams","Williams_910",256,0.206023200277186,0.159112584900219,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
911,2012,"Population structure and genetic diversity of Rana dalmatina in the   Iberian Peninsula","Conservation Genetics","The increasing fragmentation of natural habitats may strongly affect patterns of dispersal and gene flow among populations, and thus alter evolutionary dynamics. We examined genetic variation at twelve microsatellite loci in the Agile frog (Rana dalmatina) from 22 breeding ponds in the Iberian Peninsula, the southwest limit of its range, where populations of this species are severely fragmented and are of conservation concern. We investigated genetic diversity, structure and gene flow within and among populations. Diversity as observed heterozygosities ranged from 0. 257 to 0. 586. The mean number of alleles was 3. 6. Just one population showed a significant F IS value. Four populations show evidence of recent bottlenecks. Strong pattern of structure was observed due to isolation by distance and to landscape structure. The average degree of genetic differentiation among populations was F ST = 0. 185. Three operational conservation units with metapopulation structure were identified. Additionally, there are some other isolated populations. The results reinforce the view that amphibian populations are highly structured even in small geographic areas. The knowledge of genetic structure pattern and gene flow is fundamental information for developing programmes for the preservation of R. dalmatina at the limits of its geographic distribution. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10592-011-0276-z","Williams","Williams_911",195,0.112625467134899,0.0492115475969091,"200","neutral","neutral_200",1
912,2012,"Connectivity of prairie dog colonies in an altered landscape: inferences   from analysis of microsatellite DNA variation","Conservation Genetics","Connectivity of populations influences the degree to which species maintain genetic diversity and persist despite local extinctions. Natural landscape features are known to influence connectivity, but global anthropogenic landscape change underscores the importance of quantifying how human-modified landscapes disrupt connectivity of natural populations. Grasslands of western North America have experienced extensive habitat alteration, fragmenting populations of species such as black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Population sizes and the geographic range of prairie dogs have been declining for over a century due to habitat loss, disease, and eradication efforts. In many places, prairie dogs have persisted in the face of emerging urban landscapes that carve habitat into smaller and smaller fragments separated by uninhabitable areas. In extreme cases, prairie dog colonies are completely bounded by urbanization. Connectivity is particularly important for prairie dogs because colonies suffer high probabilities of extirpation by plague, and dispersal permits recolonization. Here we explore connectivity of prairie dog populations using analyses of 11 microsatellite loci for 9 prairie dog colonies spanning the fragmented landscape of Boulder County, Colorado. Isolation-by-resistance modeling suggests that wetlands and high intensity urbanization limit movement of prairie dogs. However, prairie dogs appear to move moderately well through low intensity development (including roads) and freely through cropland and grassland. Additionally, there is a marked decline in gene flow between colonies with increasing geographic distance, indicating isolation by distance even in an altered landscape. Our results suggest that prairie dog colonies retain some connectivity despite fragmentation by urbanization and agricultural development. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10592-011-0293-y","Williams","Williams_912",255,0.290158460009577,0.0248393279213051,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
913,2012,"Evidence for evolutionary distinctiveness of a newly discovered   population of sooglossid frogs on Praslin Island, Seychelles","Conservation Genetics","Amidst a worldwide decline in amphibian populations, those species endemic to islands remain an important focus for conservation efforts. The Sooglossidae are a family of frog species endemic to the Seychelles islands that are believed to have evolved in isolation for approximately 75 million years. Formerly thought to inhabit just two Seychelles islands (Mahé and Silhouette), a third population was discovered on Praslin in 2009. Phylogenetic analysis based on 438 bp of mitochondrial 16S rRNA suggests that the Praslin population is most closely related to Sooglossus sechellensis from Silhouette, and identifies these as two separate clades which together sit distinct from the population on Mahé. An average of 4. 06% uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence between the Praslin and Silhouette populations suggests substantial evolutionary divergence rather than recent introduction. Discriminant function analysis also revealed differences in morphology in frogs from Praslin and Mahé. DNA sequences of two Praslin specimens group more closely with the Mahé population, indicating some shared haplotypes that suggest recent secondary contact. Tests for a genetic signature of recent population expansion on either island were not significant. Our results suggest substantial evolutionary divergence between the three populations of S. sechellensis, most likely following isolation due to changes in sea level in the Indian Ocean. Whilst further genetic sampling and ecological studies are needed, our initial phylogenetic analyses suggest that the sooglossid population on Praslin should be managed as an evolutionarily significant unit to retain the uniqueness of its genetic diversity and its evolutionary trajectory within this ancient family of amphibians. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10592-011-0307-9","Williams","Williams_913",253,0.117122758158001,0.0810218377878592,"300","neutral","neutral_300",1
914,2012,"Genetic consequences of intensive conservation management for the   Mauritius parakeet","Conservation Genetics","For conservation managers tasked with recovering threatened species, genetic structure can exacerbate the rate of loss of genetic diversity because alleles unique to a sub-population are more likely to be lost by the effects of random genetic drift than if a population is panmictic. Given that intensive management techniques commonly used to recover threatened species frequently involve movement of individuals within and between populations, managers need to be aware not only of pre-existing levels of genetic structure but also of the potential effects that intensive management might have on these patterns. The Mauritius parakeet (Psittacula echo) has been the subject of an intensive conservation programme, involving translocation and reintroduction that has recovered the population from less than 20 individuals in 1987 to approximately 500 in 2010. Analysis of genotype data derived from 18 microsatellite markers developed for this species reveals a clear signal of structure in the population before intensive management began, but which subsequently disappears following management intervention. This study illustrates the impacts that conservation management can have on the genetic structure of an island endemic population and demonstrates how translocations or reintroductions can benefit populations of endangered species by reducing the risk of loss of genetic diversity. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10592-012-0319-0","Williams","Williams_914",202,0.145633337152864,-0.0571494894413154,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
915,2012,"Consequences of metapopulation collapse: comparison of genetic   attributes between two Allegheny woodrat metapopulations","Conservation Genetics","Disruptions in metapopulation connectivity due to demographic pressure can leave genetically isolated subpopulations susceptible to genetic drift, accumulation of deleterious alleles, and inbreeding depression. Such a scenario may be playing out within Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister) metapopulations as a series of synergistic extrinsic pressures have contributed to the rangewide decline of the species over the last 40 years. Our goal was to elucidate the effects of demographic collapse on metapopulation function by using 11 microsatellites markers to quantify differences in patterns of connectivity and genetic diversity between a demographically stable metapopulation and one in severe demographic decline. The demographically diminished metapopulation had lower levels of genetic diversity than the stable metapopulation at all levels evaluated (metapopulation-, subpopulation-, and individual-scales). In contrast to patterns of connectivity observed within the stable metapopulation, peripheral subpopulations in the diminished metapopulation had become completely isolated and were drifting toward genetic fixation, likely as a result of the extirpation of stepping-stone subpopulations. The declining genetic parameters observed within these isolated peripheral subpopulations suggest that inbreeding depression may be contributing significantly to their demographic decline. Allegheny woodrats readily express the genetic consequences of metapopulation decline due to the low effective population sizes of subpopulations and the species' limited dispersal capacity. Differences in genetic parameters observed between demographically stable and diminished Allegheny woodrat metapopulations emphasize the risks posed to metapopulation function and associated genetic processes introduced with demographic decline. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10592-012-0334-1","Williams","Williams_915",237,0.328481154974498,-0.224399112787815,"250","negative","negative_250",0

Bayesian assignment approaches-perhaps the most conservative analyses we performed-consistently grouped the sites into two distinct groups, with all individuals from the smallest and most isolated population clustering separately from the other four sites. Additional analyses revealed (1) overall significant genetic structure; (2) a pattern of population differentiation consistent with a hypothesis of isolation by resistance (landscape connectivity), but not distance; and (3) relatively short dispersal distances indicated by elevated mean pairwise relatedness in several of the sites. Our results are somewhat surprising given the small geographic distances between sites (11-34 km) and the short time (~60 years) since wide-spread deforestation in this landscape. We suspect fine-scale genetic structure may occur in many resident tropical bird species, and in the case of the chestnut-backed antbird it appears that anthropogenic habitat fragmentation has important population genetic implications. It appears that chestnut-backed antbirds may persist in fragmented landscapes in the absence of significant migration among patches, but mechanisms that allow this species to persist when many other similar species do not are not well understood. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","10.1007/s10592-012-0341-2","Williams","Williams_916",220,0.153766062625031,0.0042498958434503,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
921,2017,"Cryptic genetic diversity and spatial patterns of admixture within   Belizean marine reserves","Conservation Genetics","Despite the potential for long-distance gene flow in the sea, there is growing evidence of cryptic genetic diversity in many marine taxa. Understanding the geographic distribution of cryptic lineages, as well as the spatial patterns of admixture among them, can have important implications for conservation planning. Here, we explore patterns of divergence in a coral reef fish, the neon goby Elacatinus lori, across the species range. First, we use targeted amplicon sequencing to describe the spatial pattern of genetic divergence using two marker types (57 anonymous ddRAD-derived loci and mtDNA cytb). Second, we quantify the degree of admixture and hybridization between two previously-unidentified divergent lineages within Belize. Third, we assess whether the existing group of marine protected areas (MPAs) in Belize protects this cryptic genetic diversity. The results provide strong evidence for two divergent genetic lineages of E. lori within Belize, separated geographically by only 30 km of low-suitability habitat. There is a sharp genetic cline across these 30 km, and evidence of admixture and introgression at the boundary regions of the habitat break. We also show that the broadly-distributed arrangement of MPAs within Belize protects both major lineages as well as subtle structure within-lineages, and therefore may confer protection to co-distributed species that exhibit similar spatial patterns of divergence.","10.1007/s10592-016-0895-5","Williams","Williams_921",214,0.27110311117241,0.270892864754157,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
922,2017,"Temporal shifts in the saltmarsh-Nelson's sparrow hybrid zone revealed   by replicated demographic and genetic surveys","Conservation Genetics","Conservation of threatened or endangered species in a hybrid zone requires a comprehensive understanding of interspecific dynamics over time and space. We evaluated changes in location and composition of a hybrid zone over a 15-year period (with replicated sampling in 19972000 and 20112013) for saltmarsh (Ammodramus caudacutus) and Nelsons (A. nelsoni) sparrows, two tidal marsh specialists of high conservation priority in the northeastern United States. We combined genetic analyses using microsatellite and mitochondrial markers with species distribution patterns. In both time periods, replicate genetic sampling (n = 85; five sites) and field population surveys (93 sites) were conducted. We compared the distribution of parental species and hybrids and estimates for hybrid zone width and center between the two time periods. An increase in the relative proportion of Nelsons sparrows in sympatric marshes and an approximate doubling of hybrid zone width provides evidence for expansion. Introgression rates increased over time for neutral loci but declined for a mitochondrial gene and two gene-associated loci under the influence of selection, as expected under a speciation model with barriers to gene flow. On average, the center of the hybrid zone shifted 60 km southward over the 15 years. We placed our findings within a policy framework to evaluate management options for hybrids. We conclude that despite increasing rates of introgression, hybridization poses a substantially lesser threat to parental populations than the imminent consequences of sea-level rise and habitat degradation. Based on our current knowledge of hybrid zone dynamics in this system, we conclude that the conservation of hybrids is warranted along with parental species at this time.","10.1007/s10592-016-0920-8","Williams","Williams_922",260,0.220128350580206,0.120921368968451,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Taking into account the multiple negative impacts that allochthonous animals can cause in an ecosystem, it is important to know and track the introductions in order to take efficient management measures to enhance biodiversity conservation. We study the origin of an Ichthyosaura alpestris population in Peñalara Massif within the Guadarrama National Park, Central Spain. To accomplish this goal, we used nine microsatellite markers and sequences from 16S and ND4 genes. Both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite analyses showed the close relationship between Peñalara and Asturian populations, despite their geographical distance, confirming the allochthonous origin of this population. Interestingly, more than one introduction event seems to have occurred with individuals from Lago Ercina and Pozos de Lloroza populations participating in the founding of the Peñalara population. Due to predation, competition and transmission of diseases enhanced by its ongoing expansion, I. alpestris population might be considered a threat to Peñalara biodiversity. We advise an efficient population control to conserve the biodiversity within the Guadarrama National Park and an update of the position of this population in the Spanish indexes and list of species.","10.1007/s10592-017-0934-x","Williams","Williams_925",194,0.227576252905726,0.222484348092258,"200","neutral","neutral_200",1

In this study we apply non-invasive genetic tagging from feather samples to reveal the genetic structure and estimate local population size of red-and-green macaws (Ara chloropterus) without the need to capture these animals. The study was centered in the Tambopata region of the Peruvian Amazon. Here macaws frequently visit clay licks and their naturally molted feathers provide a unique source of non-invasively sampled DNA. We analyzed 249 feathers using nine microsatellite loci and identified 221 unique genotypes. The remainder revealed 21 individuals which were recaptured one or more times. Using a capture-mark-recapture model the average number of different individuals visiting clay licks within one breeding season was estimated to fall between 84 and 316 individuals per clay lick. Analysis of population genetic structure revealed only small genetic differences among regions and clay licks, suggesting a single red-and-green macaw genetic population. Our study confirms the utility of non-invasive genetic tagging in harsh tropical environment to obtain crucial population parameters about an abundant parrot species that is very difficult to capture in the wild.","10.1007/s10592-017-0954-6","Williams","Williams_926",200,0.298065693370846,0.0225236756362881,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
927,2017,"Landscape genetics of the Tasmanian devil: implications for spread of an   infectious cancer","Conservation Genetics","Emerging infectious diseases are increasingly recognized in species declines and extinctions. Landscape genetics can be used as a tool to predict disease emergence and spread. The Tasmanian devil is threatened with extinction by a nearly 100% fatal transmissible cancer, which has spread across 95% of the species geographic range in 20 years. Here, we present a landscape genetic analysis in the last remaining uninfected parts of the Tasmanian devils geographic range to: describe population genetic structure, characterize genetic diversity, and test the influence of landscape variables on Tasmanian devil gene flow to assess the potential for disease spread. In contrast to previous genetic studies on Tasmanian devils showing evidence for two genetic populations island-wide, our genetic based assignment tests and spatial principal components analyses suggest at least two, and possibly three, populations in a study area that is approximately 15% of the size of the overall species geographic range. Positive spatial autocorrelation declined at about 40 km, in contrast to 80 km in eastern populations, highlighting the need for range-wide genetic studies. Strong genetic structure was found between devils in the northern part of the study area and those found south of Macquarie Harbor, with weaker structure found between the northeastern and northwestern portion of our study area. Consistent with previous work, we found low overall genetic diversity, likely owing to a combination of founder effects and extreme weather events thousands of years ago that likely caused large-scale population declines. We also found possible signs of recent bottlenecks, perhaps resulting from forest clearing for dairy farming in the central part of the study area. This human disturbance also may have contributed to weak genetic structuring detected between the northeastern and northwestern part of the study area. Individual-based least cost path modeling showed limited influence of landscape variables on gene flow, with weak effects of variation in elevation in the northeast. In the northwest, however, landscape genetic models did not perform better than the null isolation-by-distance model. At the larger spatial scale of the northern part of the study area, elevation and temperatures were negatively correlated with gene flow, consistent with low dispersal suitability of higher elevation habitats that have lower temperatures and dense, wet vegetation. Overall, Tasmanian devils are a highly vagile species for which dispersal and gene flow appear to be influenced little by landscape features, and spread of devil facial tumor disease to the remaining portion of the devils geographic range seems imminent. Nonetheless, strong genetic structure found between the northern and southern portions of our study area, combined with low densities and limited possible colonization of DFTD from the east suggest there is some time for implementation of management strategies.","10.1007/s10592-017-0980-4","Williams","Williams_927",445,0.250462949308924,-0.13519255345492,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

We demonstrate that game rancher tolerance towards free-ranging wildlife has significantly decreased as the game ranching industry has evolved. Our findings reveal a conflict of interest between wealth and wildlife conservation resulting from local decision making in the absence of adequate centralized governance and evidence-based best practice.

We collected data on Antarctic fur seals from 1987/1988 to 1994/1995 at Seal Island, Antarctica. The BHM allowed us to link together predators and prey into a model that uses all the data efficiently and accounts for major sources of uncertainty. Based on the literature, we made hypotheses about the relationships in the model, which we compared with the model outcome after fitting the BHM. For each BHM parameter, we calculated the mean of the posterior density and the 95% credible interval. Our model confirmed others' findings that increased sea ice was related to increased krill density. Higher krill density led to reduced dive intensity of maternal fur seals, as measured by dive depth and duration, and to less time spent foraging by maternal fur seals. Heavier maternal fur seals and lower maternal foraging effort resulted in heavier pups at 22 d. No relationship was found between krill density and maternal mass, or between maternal mass and foraging effort on pup growth rates between 22 and 85 days of age. Maternal mass may have reflected environmental conditions prior to the pup provisioning season, rather than summer prey densities. Maternal mass and foraging effort were not related to pup growth rates between 22 and 85 d, possibly indicating that food was not limiting, food sources other than krill were being used, or differences occurred before pups reached age 22 d. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/11-0102.1","Williams","Williams_992",274,0.169912497618138,0.123285861342898,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
993,2012,"Genetic structure among coastal tailed frog populations at Mount St.   Helens is moderated by post-disturbance management","Ecological Applications","Catastrophic disturbances often provide ""natural laboratories"" that allow for greater understanding of ecological processes and response of natural populations. The 1980 eruption of the Mount St. Helens volcano in Washington, USA, provided a unique opportunity to test biotic effects of a large-scale stochastic disturbance, as well as the influence of post-disturbance management. Despite severe alteration of nearly 600 km2 of habitat, coastal tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei) were found within a portion of the blast area five years after eruption. We investigated the genetic source of recolonization within the blast area and tested whether post-eruption salvage logging and subsequent tree planting influenced tailed frog movement patterns. Our results support widespread recolonization across the blast area from multiple sources, as all sites are grouped into one genetic cluster. Landscape genetic models suggest that gene flow through the unmanaged portion of the blast area is influenced only by distance between sites and the frost-free period (r2 = 0.74). In contrast, gene flow pathways within the blast area where salvage logging and replanting occurred post-eruption are strongly limited (r2 = 0.83) by the physiologically important variables of heat load and precipitation. These data suggest that the lack of understory and coarse wood (downed and standing dead tree boles) refugia in salvaged areas may leave frogs more susceptible to desiccation and mortality than those frogs moving through the naturally regenerated area. Simulated populations based on the landscape genetic models show an increase in the inbreeding coefficient in the managed area relative to the unmanaged blast area. In sum, we show surprising resilience of an amphibian species to a catastrophic disturbance, and we suggest that, at least for this species, naturally regenerating habitat may better maintain longterm genetic diversity of populations than actively managed habitat. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/11-0627.1","Williams","Williams_993",294,0.340706061830128,-0.00162024881900192,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
998,2012,"Birds and bats reduce insect biomass and leaf damage in tropical forest   restoration sites","Ecological Applications","Both birds and bats are important insect predators in tropical systems. However, the relative influence of birds and bats on insect populations and their indirect effects on leaf damage have not previously been investigated in tropical forest restoration sites. Leaf damage by herbivorous insects can negatively affect the growth and survival of tropical plants and thus can influence the success of tropical forest restoration efforts. We used an exclosure experiment to examine the top-down effects of birds and bats on insects and leaf damage in a large-scale forest restoration experiment. Given the potential influence of tree planting design on bird and bat abundances, we also investigated planting design effects on bird and bat insectivory and leaf damage. The experiment included two planting treatment plots: islands, where trees were planted in patches, and plantations, where trees were planted in rows to create continuous cover. In both types of plots, insect biomass was highest on tree branches where both birds and bats were excluded from foraging and lowest on branches without exclosures where both birds and bats were present. In the island plots, birds and bats had approximately equal impacts on insect populations, while in plantations bats appeared to have a slightly stronger effect on insects than did birds. In plantations, the levels of leaf damage were higher on branches where birds and bats were excluded than on branches where both had access. In island plots, no significant differences in leaf damage were found between exclosure treatments although potential patterns were in the same direction as in the plantations. Our results suggest that both birds and bats play important roles as top predators in restoration systems by reducing herbivorous insects and their damage to planted trees. Tropical restoration projects should include efforts to attract and provide suitable habitat for birds and bats, given their demonstrated ecological importance. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","10.1890/11-1118.1","Williams","Williams_998",313,0.290324994439098,0.111298813709861,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1
1000,2017,"Improved management of small pelagic fisheries through seasonal climate   prediction","Ecological Applications","Populations of small pelagic fish are strongly influenced by climate. The inability of managers to anticipate environment-driven fluctuations in stock productivity or distribution can lead to overfishing and stock collapses, inflexible management regulations inducing shifts in the functional response to human predators, lost opportunities to harvest populations, bankruptcies in the fishing industry, and loss of resilience in the human food supply. Recent advances in dynamical global climate prediction systems allow for sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly predictions at a seasonal scale over many shelf ecosystems. Here we assess the utility of SST predictions at this ""fishery relevant"" scale to inform management, using Pacific sardine as a case study. The value of SST anomaly predictions to management was quantified under four harvest guidelines (HGs) differing in their level of integration of SST data and predictions. The HG that incorporated stock biomass forecasts informed by skillful SST predictions led to increases in stock biomass and yield, and reductions in the probability of yield and biomass falling below socioeconomic or ecologically acceptable levels. However, to mitigate the risk of collapse in the event of an erroneous forecast, it was important to combine such forecast-informed harvest controls with additional harvest restrictions at low biomass.","10.1002/eap.1458","Williams","Williams_1000",202,0.124241553615664,0.139142071779611,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
1001,2017,"Functional diversity response to hardwood forest management varies   across taxa and spatial scales","Ecological Applications","Contemporary forest management offers a trade-off between the potential positive effects of habitat heterogeneity on biodiversity, and the potential harm to mature forest communities caused by habitat loss and perforation of the forest canopy. While the response of taxonomic diversity to forest management has received a great deal of scrutiny, the response of functional diversity is largely unexplored. However, functional diversity may represent a more direct link between biodiversity and ecosystem function. To examine how forest management affects diversity at multiple spatial scales, we analyzed a long-term data set that captured changes in taxonomic and functional diversity of moths (Lepidoptera), longhorned beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), and breeding birds in response to contemporary silvicultural systems in oak-hickory hardwood forests. We used these data sets to address the following questions: how do even- and uneven-aged silvicultural systems affect taxonomic and functional diversity at the scale of managed landscapes compared to the individual harvested and unharvested forest patches that comprise the landscapes, and how do these silvicultural systems affect the functional similarity of assemblages at the scale of managed landscapes and patches? Due to increased heterogeneity within landscapes, we expected even-aged silviculture to increase and uneven-aged silviculture to decrease functional diversity at the landscape level regardless of impacts at the patch level. Functional diversity responses were taxon-specific with respect to the direction of change and time since harvest. Responses were also consistent across patch and landscape levels within each taxon. Moth assemblage species richness, functional richness, and functional divergence were negatively affected by harvesting, with stronger effects resulting from uneven-aged than even-aged management. Longhorned beetle assemblages exhibited a peak in species richness two years after harvesting, while functional diversity metrics did not differ between harvested and unharvested patches and managed landscapes. The species and functional richness of breeding bird assemblages increased in response to harvesting with more persistent effects in uneven- than in even-aged managed landscapes. For moth and bird assemblages, species turnover was driven by species with more extreme trait combinations. Our study highlights the variability of multi-taxon functional diversity in response to forest management across multiple spatial scales.","10.1002/eap.1532","Williams","Williams_1001",357,0.112483819886326,0.184055864401602,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
1002,2017,"Species' traits help predict small mammal responses to habitat   homogenization by an invasive grass","Ecological Applications","Invasive plants can negatively affect native species, however, the strength, direction, and shape of responses may vary depending on the type of habitat alteration and the natural history of native species. To prioritize conservation of vulnerable species, it is therefore critical to effectively predict species' responses to invasive plants, which may be facilitated by a framework based on species' traits. We studied the population and community responses of small mammals and changes in habitat heterogeneity across a gradient of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) cover, a widespread invasive plant in North America. We live-trapped small mammals over two summers and assessed the effect of cheatgrass on native small mammal abundance, richness, and species-specific and trait-based occupancy, while accounting for detection probability and other key habitat elements. Abundance was only estimated for the most common species, deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). All species were pooled for the trait-based occupancy analysis to quantify the ability of small mammal traits (habitat association, mode of locomotion, and diet) to predict responses to cheatgrass invasion. Habitat heterogeneity decreased with cheatgrass cover. Deer mouse abundance increased marginally with cheatgrass. Species richness did not vary with cheatgrass, however, pocket mouse (Perognathus spp.) and harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys spp.) occupancy tended to decrease and increase, respectively, with cheatgrass cover, suggesting a shift in community composition. Cheatgrass had little effect on occupancy for deer mice, 13-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), and Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii). Species' responses to cheatgrass primarily corresponded with our a priori predictions based on species' traits. The probability of occupancy varied significantly with a species' habitat association but not with diet or mode of locomotion. When considered within the context of a rapid habitat change, such as caused by invasive plants, relevant species' traits may provide a useful framework for predicting species' responses to a variety of habitat disturbances. Understanding which species are likely to be most affected by exotic plant invasion will help facilitate more efficient, targeted management and conservation of native species and habitats.","10.1002/eap.1535","Williams","Williams_1002",332,0.318621418431666,0.199801150787156,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1
1004,2017,"Interactive effects of predator and prey harvest on ecological   resilience of rocky reefs","Ecological Applications","A major goal of ecosystem-based fisheries management is to prevent fishery-induced shifts in community states. This requires an understanding of ecological resilience: the ability of an ecosystem to return to the same state following a perturbation, which can strongly depend on species interactions across trophic levels. We use a structured model of a temperate rocky reef to explore how multi-trophic level fisheries impact ecological resilience. Increasing fishing mortality of prey (urchins) has a minor effect on equilibrium biomass of kelp, urchins, and spiny lobster predators, but increases resilience by reducing the range of predator harvest rates at which alternative stable states are possible. Size-structured predation on urchins acts as the feedback maintaining each state. Our results demonstrate that the resilience of ecosystems strongly depends on the interactive effects of predator and prey harvest in multi-trophic level fisheries, which are common in marine ecosystems but are unaccounted for by traditional management.","10.1002/eap.1581","Williams","Williams_1004",155,0.265026461562058,0.307650886277987,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
1006,2017,"Understanding the demographic drivers of realized population growth   rates","Ecological Applications","Identifying the demographic parameters (e.g., reproduction, survival, dispersal) that most influence population dynamics can increase conservation effectiveness and enhance ecological understanding. Life table response experiments (LTRE) aim to decompose the effects of change in parameters on past demographic outcomes (e.g., population growth rates). But the vast majority of LTREs and other retrospective population analyses have focused on decomposing asymptotic population growth rates, which do not account for the dynamic interplay between population structure and vital rates that shape realized population growth rates ( t=Nt+1/Nt) in time-varying environments. We provide an empirical means to overcome these shortcomings by merging recently developed ""transient life-table response experiments"" with integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs allow for the estimation of latent population structure and other demographic parameters that are required for transient LTRE analysis, and Bayesian versions additionally allow for complete error propagation from the estimation of demographic parameters to derivations of realized population growth rates and perturbation analyses of growth rates. By integrating available monitoring data for Lesser Scaup over 60 yr, and conducting transient LTREs on IPM estimates, we found that the contribution of juvenile female survival to long-term variation in realized population growth rates was 1.6 and 3.7 times larger than that of adult female survival and fecundity, respectively. But a persistent long-term decline in fecundity explained 92% of the decline in abundance between 1983 and 2006. In contrast, an improvement in adult female survival drove the modest recovery in Lesser Scaup abundance since 2006, indicating that the most important demographic drivers of Lesser Scaup population dynamics are temporally dynamic. In addition to resolving uncertainty about Lesser Scaup population dynamics, the merger of IPMs with transient LTREs will strengthen our understanding of demography for many species as we aim to conserve biodiversity during an era of non-stationary global change.","10.1002/eap.1594","Williams","Williams_1006",298,0.543492464968785,0.358512925286803,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
1009,2017,"Long-term trends in trait structure of riverine communities facing   predation risk increase and trophic resource decline","Ecological Applications","Many large European rivers have undergone multiple pressures that have strongly impaired ecosystem functioning at different spatial and temporal scales. Global warming and other environmental changes have favored the success of invasive species, deeply modifying the structure of aquatic communities in large rivers. Some exogenous species could alter trophic interactions within assemblages by increasing the predation risk for potential prey species (top-down effect) and limiting the dynamics of others via resource availability limitation (bottom-up effect). Furthermore, large transboundary rivers are complex aquatic ecosystems that have often been poorly investigated so that data for assessing long-term ecological trends are missing. In this study, we propose an original approach for investigating long-term combined effects of global warming, trophic resource decrease, predation risk, and water quality variations on the trait-based structure of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages over 26 yr (1985-2011) and 427-km stretch of the river Meuse (France and Belgium). The study of temporal variations in biological, physiological, and ecological traits of macroinvertebrate and fish allowed identifying community trends and distinguishing impacts of environmental perturbations from those induced by biological alterations. We provide evidence, for this large European river, of an increase in water temperature (close to 1°C) and a decrease in phytoplankton biomass (-85%), as well as independent effects of these changes on both invertebrate and fish communities. The reduction of trophic resources in the water column by invasive molluscs has dramatically affected the density of omnivorous fish in favor of invertebrate feeders, while scrapers became the major feeding guild among invertebrates. Macroinvertebrate and fish communities have shifted from large-sized organisms with low fecundity to prolific, small-sized organisms, with early maturity, as a response to increased predation pressure.","10.1002/eap.1621","Williams","Williams_1009",280,0.187874328689492,0.0650315670597027,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Focusing on luxury seafood, in particular bêche-de-mer, shark fin and live reef food fish, this paper firstly examines the links between Chinese consumption and species population trends in source countries. After a discussion of current efforts at conservation and management of these fisheries, the paper shows how the consumption of luxury seafood in contemporary China is intertwined with broader historical trends, including the expansion of Southern Chinese cuisine; cultural beliefs and traditions, in particular surrounding elements of traditional Chinese medicine; and most importantly, notions of social status and conspicuous consumption linked to the development of the Chinese economy and social stratification.

1046,2012,"Opinions of the public, conservationists and magistrates on sentencing   wildlife trade crimes in the UK","Environmental Conservation","The illegal trade in wild harvested plants and animals is a significant threat to populations and species worldwide. There is concern that in many countries sanctions for wildlife trade crimes are insufficient to act as a deterrent, and do not reflect the seriousness of offences. For these reasons it is important to understand professional and public opinions as to which aspects of such crimes make them more or less serious, and so deserving of a greater or lesser sentence. Conjoint analysis, a method used in marketing to understand which characteristics of a product are valued by consumers, was used to investigate which attributes of hypothetical wildlife trade offences (threat status and taxon of species involved, illegal profit, previous convictions and plea) UK-based conservation professionals, magistrates and the general public considered most important when sentencing wildlife criminals in the UK. Eighty-seven per cent of 682 respondents completed enough of the survey to be included in the analysis. Magistrates and the public considered illegal profit to be the single most important attribute, while conservationists considered the threat status of the species involved to be most important (considered second most important by magistrates and the public). Magistrates, when presented with adequate information, considered the threat status and corresponding legal protection afforded to wildlife when considering how serious a wildlife trade crime was, and doing so is in line with public opinion on sentencing such offences. This study highlights the importance of ensuring that judiciaries are presented with information concerning both the potential profit and conservation impact of wildlife trade crimes.

Many have been subject to commercial deep-sea bottom trawl fisheries and have exhibited 'boom and bust' characteristics. There is growing concern about the effect of fishing on fragile and vulnerable benthic invertebrate species. This review examines why deep-sea fisheries have generally failed, and recommends measures that are necessary to improve their sustainability. Much is based on lessons learned in the south-west Pacific that may be more generally applicable to global deep-sea fisheries. Sustainable fisheries require highly precautionary feature-based catch limits, and credible and timely stock assessment advice. Management also needs to consider fishing impacts on the benthic habitat, and while reducing and spreading fishing effort on seamounts is beneficial for fish stocks, it can have a negative effect on the benthos. To balance exploitation and conservation, elements of spatial management are required, whereby some seamounts are protected before any fishing has occurred. Protected areas should include entire seamounts, and multiple seamounts in a network. A management regime should incorporate closed seamounts, open seamounts for fishing, and management of adjacent slope areas where these are important for the productivity of fish and invertebrate populations. © Copyright Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2012.","10.1017/S0376892912000021","Williams","Williams_1047",205,0.236770905825712,0.291616556565243,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

This is particularly common when resource users perceive more personal costs than benefits from specific management actions. Analysis of interviews with managers and fishers from 22 landing sites along the coast of Kenya indicated how key stakeholders perceived the scale of benefits and costs from different management strategies. Potential underlying causes of divergent perceptions towards different management tools were evaluated, including marine protected areas, no-take fisheries closures, gear use, minimum size of fish caught and species restrictions. The analysis identified three distinct opinion groups: (1) a group of nine landing sites that scaled their preference for most management restrictions neutral to low, with exceptions for minimum sizes of captured fish and gear restrictions; (2) a group of eight landing sites that scaled their preference for the above and species restrictions and closed season higher, and were more neutral about closures and marine protected areas; and (3) a group containing four landing sites and the managers' offices that rated their preference for the above and closed areas and marine protected areas as high. Logistic regression was used to examine whether these groups differed in wealth, education, age, perceptions of disparity in benefits, dependence on fishing and distance to government marine protected areas. The most frequent significant factor was the resource users' perceived disparity between the benefits of the management to themselves and their communities, with the benefits to the government. Consequently, efforts to reduce this real or perceived disparity are likely to increase adoption and compliance rates. Most widespread positively-viewed restrictions, such as gear use and minimum size of fish, should be promoted at the national level while other restrictions may be more appropriately implemented at the community level. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2012.","10.1017/S0376892912000197","Williams","Williams_1049",302,0.220096798228668,0.331039887556364,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0

Although war may have substantial impacts on hunting, how these effects vary across different spatial scales and over multiple stages of warfare remain largely unknown. In addition, despite serious conflicts that may have affected hunting patterns in West Africa, no studies have examined the impacts of war on hunting in Sierra Leone. We used the randomized response technique together with semi-structured interviews to examine variations in hunting techniques and the proportion of the population that engages in hunting over three time periods (before, during and after war) among different communities bordering a protected area. At the scale of the whole protected area, the proportion of people hunting did not vary significantly over time. Similarly, the methods used for hunting were generally consistent over time and space. However, within each community, the proportion of the population hunting varied significantly over time, and the locations with the greatest participation rates in hunting changed at each time period. Access to alternative livelihood options and the severity of the war's impact shaped patterns of change in hunting participation across different communities.

In this paper, we compare wildlife species preferences among children from a continental location (North Carolina, USA, n = 433) and an island location (Andros Island, The Bahamas, n = 197). Children on the island preferred feral domesticated species and different types of taxa than mainland children, perhaps due to the strongly divergent species richness between the regions (e.g. island children showed greater preferences for invertebrates, lizards and aquatic species). Boys preferred fish, birds and lizards more than girls, whereas girls preferred mammals. The fact that island children showed strong preferences for invasive species suggests challenges for conservation efforts on islands, where controlling invasive exotic species is often of paramount importance, but can conflict with cultural preferences for these same species.","10.1017/S0376892917000133","Williams","Williams_1058",174,0.408235732982144,0.28183310002299,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Surveys were performed by recording the number and size of edible fish species and benthic composition. Fishing impact was described through six proxies representing level of catch, alternative incomes, degree of commercial catch and country economic development derived from a simultaneous socioeconomic assessment. The relative importance of broadly defined habitat (geographical location, island and reef type, substrate composition) and fishing impact in controlling the distribution of fish trophic groups, families and species was measured through multivariate analysis. The extreme faunistic diversity was shown by the large variation in fish density (difference of up to an order of magnitude) and fish biomass (displaying a 20-fold difference across the region). Herbivores were dominant in the eastern part of the region, at what we classified as complex islands and at islands with small lagoon and at coastal reefs, while carnivores were dominant at oceanic islands and atolls and at outer reefs. Specific habitat associations were shown for Scaridae, Acanthuridae, Siganidae, Balistidae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae and Serranidae. Relative importance and size decrease of several fish families (Mullidae, Scaridae, Lutjanidae and Serranidae) were related to high fishing impact. Acanthuridae and Lethrinidae appeared to have a role as opportunistic groups in impacted sites. The relative impact from fishing and habitat on fishes accounted for, respectively, 20 and 30% of variance, demonstrating the effect of human impacts even at such large scale and taking into account only limited fishing impact variables. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00425.x","Williams","Williams_1079",256,0.113830998496056,0.0603551942164147,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

We present a case-study from over 100years of data for the endemic landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, Salmonidae) and brown trout (Salmo trutta, Salmonidae) in Lake Vänern, Sweden. We use this case-study to develop life history-based research and monitoring priorities for migratory salmonids. In Vänern, small wild populations of salmon and trout remain only in the heavily regulated Rivers Klar (Klarälven) and Gullspång (Gullspångsälven), and commercial and sport fisheries are maintained by hatchery stocking. These populations represent some of the last remaining large-bodied (up to 20kg) landlocked salmon stocks worldwide. We found that one of four stocks of wild fish has increased since 1996; the other three remain critically low. Hatchery return rates for three of four stocks appear stable at roughly 1% and annual fisheries catch is roughly 75metric tons, with an estimated 7.5% of hatchery smolts being recruited to the fishery; this also appears relatively stable since 1990. Our analysis reveals much uncertainty in key data requirements, including both river return and fisheries catch rates, estimates of wild smolt production and survival, and hatchery breeding and genetics protocols. These uncertainties, coupled with a lack of information on their riverine and lacustrine ecology, preclude effective management of these unique populations.

1081,2012,"Beyond Individual Transferrable Quotas: methodologies for integrating   ecosystem impacts of fishing into fisheries catch rights","Fish and Fisheries","While there has been a growing concern for the adverse ecological impacts of fishing, progress on incorporating these into operational fisheries management has been slow. Many fisheries management organizations have addressed the problem of overharvesting and over-capitalization first. In this domain, the question of access regulation has gained growing recognition as a key dimension of fisheries sustainability, leading to recommendation and progressive implementation of rights-based systems, in particular Individual Transferrable Quotas (ITQs). While adjustments in fishing capacity resulting from the implementation of these systems may entail a reduction in some unwanted ecosystem impacts of fishing, it is also recognized that they will not be sufficient to achieve the ecological outcomes increasingly demanded by the global community. There is thus a need to examine the possibilities for a common management framework for dealing with both over-capitalization of fisheries and adverse ecological effects of fishing. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of incorporating greater ecosystem goods and services into ITQ policy instruments initially designed with a narrow focus on commercial target species. We consider the advantages and limitations of alternative approaches in this respect and identify some of the practical issues associated with the different alternatives, in particular the underpinning knowledge requirements. We argue that given the need for increasingly streamlined management processes, further investigation into practical ways forward in this domain is crucial if management of fisheries is to achieve economic efficiency while fully encompassing the ecologically sustainable development objectives of ecosystem-based fisheries management. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Commonwealth of Australia.","10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00442.x","Williams","Williams_1081",255,0.395968729729901,0.196909215131407,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
1083,2012,"Seafood mislabelling: comparisons of two western European case studies   assist in defining influencing factors, mechanisms and motives","Fish and Fisheries","The global seafood industry, influenced by consumer demand, is closely linked to the global fishing industry, which determines the variety of fish available for consumption. The recently revealed issue of seafood mislabelling threatens to weaken this link by removing consumer power to influence patterns of fisheries exploitation through informed choice. Recognizing this, there is an urgent need to go beyond the mere documentation of the phenomenon and learn more about the origins of this problem and the nature of factors influencing its occurrence to develop solutions. In an attempt to understand seafood mislabelling more thoroughly in Europe, 226 cod products were purchased from Ireland and the UK, genetically identified using a DNA barcoding technique (COI barcoding gene), and species identification results were compared against product labels. Cod mislabelling proved more severe in Ireland than in the UK (28.4% vs. 7.4%). Moreover, whereas data show that in Ireland, cheaper species are sold as cod, in the UK, threatened Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) may be sold as 'sustainably sourced' Pacific cod. Considering these countries operate under the same EU policies for seafood traceability and labelling, it is likely that this situation has been influenced by heightened consumer awareness in the UK, which has created an environment where mislabelling is discouraged. In addition to identifying samples, traceability information from packaged cod was used to trace products back to supplying companies. Although inconclusive in determining blame, this exercise has demonstrated that using traceability information can add explanatory power when attempting to determine responsibility for the occurrence of mislabelling. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00426.x","Williams","Williams_1083",254,0.240475070049022,0.0154028309583931,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
1084,2012,"Conservation status of eulachon in the California Current","Fish and Fisheries","Eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), an anadromous smelt in the Northeast Pacific Ocean was examined for listing under the USA's Endangered Species Act (ESA). A southern Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of eulachon - that occurs in the California Current and is composed of numerous subpopulations that spawn in rivers from northern California to northern British Columbia - was identified on the basis of ecological and environmental characteristics, and to a lesser extent, genetic and life history variation. Although the northern terrestrial boundary of this DPS remains uncertain, our consensus opinion was that this northern boundary occurs south of the Nass River and that the DPS was discrete from more northern eulachon, as well as significant to the biological species as a whole and thus is a 'species' under the ESA. Eulachon have been nearly absent in northern California for over two decades, have declined in the Fraser River by over 97% in the past 10years, and are at historically low levels in other British Columbia rivers in the DPS, and nearly so in the Columbia River. Major threats to southern eulachon include climate change impacts on ocean and freshwater habitat, by-catch in offshore shrimp trawl fisheries, changes in downstream flow timing and intensity owing to dams and water diversions, and predation. These threats, together with large declines in abundance, indicate that the southern DPS of eulachon is at moderate risk of extinction throughout all of its range. The southern DPS was listed as threatened under the ESA in May 2010 - the first marine forage fish to be afforded these statutory protections, which apply only to waters under U.S. jurisdiction.

1085,2012,"Assessing opportunity and relocation costs of marine protected areas   using a behavioural model of longline fleet dynamics","Fish and Fisheries","Increasing use of spatial management tools in fisheries requires an understanding of fleet response, and in particular to where displaced fishing effort is likely to move. We develop a state-dependent decision-making model to address the spatial allocation of effort in an Australian tuna longline fishery. We assume that fishers have an economic objective in deciding where to fish, but that decisions in any period are also influenced by the remaining quota held at the time of the decision. Key features of the model include endogenous price dynamics, a moving stock and a competitive pool of different vessel types operating from different port locations. We utilize this model to illustrate fleet responses to marine reserves and limits on fishing effort. The results illustrate that the model framework provides advantages over statistically based models in that decisions made in response to the imposition of a reserve are not consistent with a proportional reallocation of effort. Rather, the stochastic dynamic model yielded an overall profit level of ~4% higher relative to scenarios with no reserve. Incorporating the opportunity cost of a quota into the model resulted in an optimal utilization of effort, in which effort was concentrated in time periods and locations yielding maximized profit. Under a low level of effort relative to the season length, the model indicated an overall profit level 43% greater than the highest obtained when the same level of effort was applied solely within any given quarter of the season. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00422.x","Williams","Williams_1085",245,0.180099322181274,0.144956425732786,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
1089,2017,"Global reduction fisheries and their products in the context of   sustainable limits","Fish and Fisheries","Globally, one-sixth of landings from marine capture fisheries are destined for the production of fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO), which are currently overwhelming utilized by fed aquaculture. Many different species are used globally for the production of FMFO, but little concern has been given to the divergent environmental and ecological impacts of FMFO products based on species, ecosystem and fishing gear used in their capture. We evaluated the variable environmental performance of FMFO products from a wide range of fisheries whose products are either primarily intended for reduction or whose by-products are redirected to reduction. Assessed fisheries accounted for 44% of global reduction fishery landings in 2014. Analysis was conducted on the basis of two measures: the carbon footprint (i.e., greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions) and the marine footprint (i.e., primary production required [PPR]). We found large differences between the impacts of FMFO products across the 18 reduction fisheries examined. Cumulatively, we estimate that reduction fisheries emitted 4.6 million tonnes of CO2-e GHGs in 2014, and appropriated over 4% of primary production in some ecosystems, demonstrating a non-trivial impact. As demand for aquafeeds grow, the sustainable sourcing of raw material inputs will be of great importance. Results here suggest that the source of FMFO inputs can have dramatic effects on the environmental performance of fish feeds and fed aquaculture. We recommend further research on the environmental and ecological impacts of food production systems, and specifically to understand these results in relation to global production and sustainable boundaries.","10.1111/faf.12222","Williams","Williams_1089",246,0.31400696701744,0.139889438737876,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
1090,2017,"Ecoviability for ecosystem-based fisheries management","Fish and Fisheries","Reconciling food security, economic development and biodiversity conservation is a key challenge, especially in the face of the demographic transition characterizing many countries in the world. Fisheries and marine ecosystems constitute a difficult application of this bio-economic challenge. Many experts and scientists advocate an ecosystem approach to manage marine socio-ecosystems for their sustainability and resilience. However, the ways by which to operationalize ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) remain poorly specified. We propose a specific methodological frameworkviability modellingto do so. We show how viability modelling can be applied using four contrasted case-studies: two small-scale fisheries in South America and Pacific and two larger-scale fisheries in Europe and Australia. The four fisheries are analysed using the same modelling framework, structured around a set of common methods, indicators and scenarios. The calibrated models are dynamic, multispecies and multifleet and account for various sources of uncertainty. A multicriteria evaluation is used to assess the scenarios outcomes over a long time horizon with different constraints based on ecological, social and economic reference points. Results show to what extent the bio-economic and ecosystem risks associated with the adoption of status quo strategies are relatively high and challenge the implementation of EBFM. In contrast, strategies called ecoviability or co-viability strategies, that aim at satisfying the viability constraints, reduce significantly these ecological and economic risks and promote EBFM. The gains associated with those ecoviability strategies, however, decrease with the intensity of regulations imposed on these fisheries.","10.1111/faf.12224","Williams","Williams_1090",247,0.203111160544214,0.0192887069965067,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

National policies have historically encouraged unsustainable practices, and recent decades have witnessed a sharp increase in harmful activities. Our aim with this review was to expose this situation and illustrate how national policies constitute the main threat to freshwater fish biodiversity. We explain that the most devastating, pervasive and systemic threats are rooted in official policies, particularly unsustainable activities (e.g. hydropower, water diversion, mining, aquaculture, agriculture and fishing), poor management/conservation (e.g. fish stocking and passages) and harmful legislation (e.g. poor licensing, non-native species). We provide a broad portrait of the Neotropical scenario, where unsustainable policies have caused considerable damage to freshwater ecosystems, and focus on major examples from Brazil, where development projects have caused large-scale losses to fish biodiversity. Such modus operandi of human development is incompatible with the persistence of biodiversity, and no simple solution is available to correct or minimize its effects. The current situation demands a profound behavioural shift towards better practices and policies, or these multiple high-impact activities will continue eroding freshwater fish biodiversity and impairing essential ecosystem services.","10.1111/faf.12228","Williams","Williams_1091",202,0.387499238262716,-0.029223286947066,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

The review provided 523 abstracts of which 19 areas from various regions worldwide had peer-reviewed studies that met strict selection criteria. Criteria included fisher involvement, biodiversity conservation and fisheries management objectives. A repeat search without fisher and synonyms found, 62,622 papers indicating that most closed area studies had no mention of any fisher involvement. The general success of the areas selected suggests that fisher involvement benefits both biological conservation and fisheries management. Fisheries and biodiversity conservation outcomes were not exclusive to any one type of management closure (e.g. MPA, Fishery Closure). Twenty-four indicators were selected, designed to provide measurable targets. High scoring indicators included management, planning and socio-economic indicators such as local support (100%), habitat protection (100%), conservation and fisheries objectives (100%), monitoring (91.7%) and fishers concerns (91.7%). Bio-ecological-based indicators scored lower in most cases for all types of areas. Fisheries closures rated as highly as the MPAs with respect to both fisheries and bio-ecological indicators. The scorecard provided a reasonable means to evaluate management success in the light of often qualitative or missing data. Addressing the interests and utilizing knowledge of those affected by closures and familiar with the area, most often local fishers, is key to achieving management objectives.","10.1111/faf.12211","Williams","Williams_1092",247,0.311466404301293,0.317268392959794,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
1093,2017,"Indirect effects of bottom fishing on the productivity of marine fish","Fish and Fisheries","One quarter of marine fish production is caught with bottom trawls and dredges on continental shelves around the world. Towed bottom-fishing gears typically kill 2050 per cent of the benthic invertebrates in their path, depending on gear type, substrate and vulnerability of particular taxa. Particularly vulnerable are epifaunal species, which stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for benthic invertebrates. To identify the habitats, fisheries or target species most likely to be affected, we review evidence of the indirect effects of bottom fishing on fish production. Recent studies have found differences in the diets of certain species in relation to bottom fishing intensity, thereby linking demersal fish to their benthic habitats at spatial scales of ~10 km. Bottom fishing affects diet composition and prey quality rather than the amount of prey consumed; scavenging of discarded by-catch makes only a small contribution to yearly food intake. Flatfish may benefit from light trawling levels on sandy seabeds, while higher-intensity trawling on more vulnerable habitats has a negative effect. Models suggest that reduction in the carrying capacity of habitats by bottom fishing could lead to lower equilibrium yield and a lower level of fishing mortality to obtain maximum yield. Trawling effort is patchily distributed  small fractions of fishing grounds are heavily fished, while large fractions are lightly fished or unfished. This patchiness, coupled with the foraging behaviour of demersal fish, may mitigate the indirect effects of bottom fishing on fish productivity. Current research attempts to scale up these localized effects to the population level.","10.1111/faf.12193","Williams","Williams_1093",251,0.222376149597588,0.0197194480868445,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

We conducted a literature review of 390 studies to assess how fisheries characteristics affected management tool performance across both small-scale and large-scale fisheries. We defined success as increased or maintained abundance or biomass, reductions in fishing mortality or improvements in population status. Because the literature only covered a narrow set of biological factors, we also conducted an expert elicitation to create a typology of broader fishery characteristics, enabling conditions and design considerations that affect performance. The literature suggested that the most commonly used management tool in a region was often the most successful, although the scale of success varied. Management tools were more often deemed successful when used in combination, particularly pairings of tools that controlled fishing mortality or effort with spatial management. Examples of successful combinations were the use of catch limits with quotas and limited entry, and marine protected areas with effort restrictions. The most common factors associated with inadequate biological performance were structural issues, including poor design or implementation. The expert-derived typologies revealed strong local leadership, high community involvement and governance capacity as common factors of success across management tool categories (i.e. input, output and technical measures), but the degree of importance varied. Our results are designed to inform selection of appropriate management tools based on empirical data and experience to increase the likelihood of successful fisheries management.","10.1111/faf.12192","Williams","Williams_1094",253,0.399878538115621,0.371413978336318,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
1095,2017,"Efficiency of fisheries is increasing at the ecosystem level","Fish and Fisheries","Managing fisheries presents trade-offs between objectives, for example yields, profits, minimizing ecosystem impact, that have to be weighed against one another. These trade-offs are compounded by interacting species and fisheries at the ecosystem level. Weighing objectives becomes increasingly challenging when managers have to consider opposing objectives from different stakeholders. An alternative to weighing incomparable and conflicting objectives is to focus on winwins until Pareto efficiency is achieved: a state from which it is impossible to improve with respect to any objective without regressing at least one other. We investigate the ecosystem-level efficiency of fisheries in five large marine ecosystems (LMEs) with respect to yield and an aggregate measure of ecosystem impact using a novel calibration of size-based ecosystem models. We estimate that fishing patterns in three LMEs (North Sea, Barents Sea and Benguela Current) are nearly efficient with respect to long-term yield and ecosystem impact and that efficiency has improved over the last 30 years. In two LMEs (Baltic Sea and North East US Continental Shelf), fishing is inefficient and winwins remain available. We additionally examine the efficiency of North Sea and Baltic Sea fisheries with respect to economic rent and ecosystem impact, finding both to be inefficient but steadily improving. Our results suggest the following: (i) a broad and encouraging trend towards ecosystem-level efficiency of fisheries; (ii) that ecosystem-scale winwins, especially with respect to conservation and profits, may still be common; and (iii) single-species assessment approaches may overestimate the availability of winwins by failing to account for trade-offs across interacting species.","10.1111/faf.12171","Williams","Williams_1095",264,0.327128210044713,0.319705797466534,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Therefore, we investigated breeding season habitat use of radio-tagged wild turkeys (n= 78) in a frequently burned pine savanna system in southwest Georgia during 2003-2005. Ground story vegetation structure and composition in pine savannas change rapidly following fire such that categorical (i.e., burned vs. unburned) habitat selection analyses does not depict the fine scaled time-dependent relationships; therefore, we analyzed turkey selection of savanna on a seasonal and continuous scale. From a seasonal standpoint, pine savanna habitat-type were selected by gobblers, but used less than availability by hens. However, selection of pine savanna was influenced by time since fire; hens more likely selected pine savannas burned within 1.4. years whereas gobblers selected pine savannas burned within 1.6. years. Hens also selected hardwood drains whereas gobblers demonstrated proportional use of these habitats. Selection of pine savannas by wild turkeys was dependent on application of prescribed burning <2. years and suggests that previous recommendations for longer burning frequencies are too long to balance turkey habitat needs with those of a suite of declining birds associated with pine savanna ecosystems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","10.1016/j.foreco.2012.07.051","Williams","Williams_1133",218,0.265296224962595,-0.00965514085960947,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
1144,2017,"Relative importance of timber harvest and habitat for reptiles in   experimental forestry plots","Forest Ecology and Management","Forestry practices affect various habitat characteristics that influence wildlife populations. Understanding the relative importance of the broad effects of forestry practices versus specific habitat variables for wildlife may help managers balance multiple forest management objectives and potentially adjust forestry practices to better conserve biodiversity. We compared the relative importance of experimental timber harvest treatments (clearcutting, thinning to remove undesirable tree species) to habitat variables (coarse down wood, herbaceous vegetation, leaf litter) for captures of reptiles in central Missouri, USA for two years post-harvest. We also used drift fences along the edges between uncut control forest and clearcut to detect changes in movements between treatments after timber harvest, which is one potential mechanism for differences in captures among timber harvest treatments. We found that habitat variables best predicted captures of small snakes, while both habitat and timber harvest treatment predicted lizard captures. Two lizard taxa (Plestiodon spp., Sceloporus undulatus) had higher captures in clearcuts than in the no harvest control, which is consistent with studies across the southeastern United States. Plestiodon spp. showed significantly more movements into clearcuts from control forest than in the opposite direction, demonstrating that higher captures in clearcuts were at least in part due to immigration from adjacent forested areas. Small snakes and Sceloporus undulatus captures were higher in areas with more coarse down wood and higher herbaceous vegetation cover, which were associated with the clearcut plots. These results for small snakes are consistent with another study in Missouri, but in contrast to two from South Carolina, indicating that there may be regional differences in the response of small snakes to forestry practices. Further work on the effects of forestry management on reptiles should examine regional differences and seek to understand underlying mechanisms.","10.1016/j.foreco.2017.07.014","Williams","Williams_1144",287,0.257940025587918,0.231634058912343,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
1179,2012,"Effects of climate change on an emperor penguin population: analysis of   coupled demographic and climate models","Global Change Biology","Sea ice conditions in the Antarctic affect the life cycle of the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). We present a population projection for the emperor penguin population of Terre Adélie, Antarctica, by linking demographic models (stage-structured, seasonal, nonlinear, two-sex matrix population models) to sea ice forecasts from an ensemble of IPCC climate models. Based on maximum likelihood capture-mark-recapture analysis, we find that seasonal sea ice concentration anomalies (SIC a) affect adult survival and breeding success. Demographic models show that both deterministic and stochastic population growth rates are maximized at intermediate values of annual SIC a, because neither the complete absence of sea ice, nor heavy and persistent sea ice, would provide satisfactory conditions for the emperor penguin. We show that under some conditions the stochastic growth rate is positively affected by the variance in SIC a. We identify an ensemble of five general circulation climate models whose output closely matches the historical record of sea ice concentration in Terre Adélie. The output of this ensemble is used to produce stochastic forecasts of SIC a, which in turn drive the population model. Uncertainty is included by incorporating multiple climate models and by a parametric bootstrap procedure that includes parameter uncertainty due to both model selection and estimation error. The median of these simulations predicts a decline of the Terre Adélie emperor penguin population of 81% by the year 2100. We find a 43% chance of an even greater decline, of 90% or more. The uncertainty in population projections reflects large differences among climate models in their forecasts of future sea ice conditions. One such model predicts population increases over much of the century, but overall, the ensemble of models predicts that population declines are far more likely than population increases. We conclude that climate change is a significant risk for the emperor penguin.

1229,2012,"Impacts of an invasive herbivore on indigenous forests","Journal of Applied Ecology","Invasive herbivores can have large negative impacts on natural ecosystems. Management of invasive populations often requires frequent, broadscale, expensive control, which must be justified by demonstrating progress in achieving conservation objectives. This study evaluates benefits of regular extensive control of an invasive herbivore and develops an alternative strategy based on damage thresholds. We carried out replicated experimental management of brushtail possums, Trichosurus vulpecula, in three areas of native forest in New Zealand. Each area included a site that had extensive possum control for 10 years, prior to and during the 5-year study, and a paired site with no control. We measured indices of possum browse on c.2400 possum 'preferred' and c.1200 'non-preferred' trees, and an index of possum abundance, at the beginning and end of the experiment. Extensive control was effective in reducing possum browse on preferred tree species. Reductions in browse led to increased foliage cover and decreased probability of tree mortality. The probability of browse on an individual tree decreased with increasing amounts of possum-preferred foliage on nearby trees but increased with tree size and with increasing levels of browse on nearby trees. At one site where possum control ceased prematurely, foliage cover decreased, reducing benefits from earlier control. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides evidence that sustained, extensive control of invasive herbivores can result in significant conservation benefits to susceptible tree species, and that both impacts and benefits can be measured using data typically collected in herbivore impact studies. Furthermore, it shows how local factors such as forest composition can influence the impact of herbivory, how this can be included in large-scale assessments of the benefits of pest control and how site- and species-specific damage thresholds can be derived for improving pest management.

1232,2012,"Vehicle traffic shapes grizzly bear behaviour on a multiple-use   landscape","Journal of Applied Ecology","Roads cause functional habitat loss, alter movement patterns and can become ecological traps for wildlife. Many of the negative effects of roads are likely to be a function of the human use of roads, not the road itself. However, few studies have examined the effect of temporally and spatially varying traffic patterns on large mammals, which could lead to misinterpretations about the impact of roads on wildlife. We developed models of traffic volume for an entire road network in south-western Alberta, Canada, and documented for the first time the response of grizzly bears Ursus arctos L to a wide range of traffic levels. Traffic patterns caused a clear behavioural shift in grizzly bears, with increased use of areas near roads and movement across roads during the night when traffic was low. Bears selected areas near roads travelled by fewer than 20 vehicles per day and were more likely to cross these roads. Bears avoided roads receiving moderate traffic (20-100 vehicles per day) and strongly avoided high-use roads (>100 vehicles per day) at all times. Synthesis and applications. Grizzly bear responses to traffic caused a departure from typical behavioural patterns, with bears in our study being largely nocturnal. In addition, bears selected private agricultural land, which had lower traffic levels, but higher road density, over multi-use public land. These results improve our understanding of bear responses to roads and can be used to refine management practices. Future management plans should employ a multi-pronged approach aimed at limiting both road density and traffic in core habitats. Access management will be critical in such plans and is an important tool for conserving threatened wildlife populations. © 2012 The Authors.

1233,2012,"Exploiting avian vision with aircraft lighting to reduce bird strikes","Journal of Applied Ecology","1.Bird-aircraft collisions (bird strikes) represent a substantial safety concern and financial burden to civil aviation world-wide. Despite an increase in the rate of damaging bird strikes, necessary steps to develop a mitigation method outside of the airport environment have not been empirically tested. 2.We assessed whether use of aircraft lighting might enhance detection of and reaction to the approach of an aircraft in flight by Canada geese Branta canadensis Linnaeus, a species responsible for a high rate of damaging bird strikes. We used a novel approach by estimating the visibility to the goose visual system of a standard radio-controlled (RC) aircraft (standard aircraft) exhibiting either a 2-Hz alternating pulse of two lights, or lights off; and another RC aircraft designed to mimic a raptor (predator model). We then exposed wing-clipped Canada geese to the approach of each aircraft and quantified behavioural responses to respective treatments. 3.Estimates of chromatic and achromatic contrasts indicated that the standard aircraft with lights on was more salient to the visual system of the Canada goose than with lights off or the predator model. 4.At individual and group levels, quicker alert responses were observed to the standard aircraft with lights compared with the lights off and predator model. Goose groups showed similar responses to approaches by the standard aircraft and the predator model, suggesting use of antipredator behaviour to avoid the aircraft. 5.Synthesis and applications. Understanding animal sensory ecology and associated behaviours can aid the development of methods exploiting certain behaviours to reduce negative human-wildlife interactions. For example, reducing the frequency of bird strikes requires the integration of wildlife management efforts within and outside of the airport environment that target species resource use and response to disturbance, with mitigation techniques focused on the aircraft. Moreover, the design of aircraft lighting systems to enhance detection and avoidance by birds is contingent upon understanding avian visual ecology and behaviour. Based on spectral sensitivity in Canada geese, aircraft-mounted lights that peak in the ultraviolet/violet range (380-400nm) are likely to produce the maximal behavioural effect.

1235,2012,"Predicting species vulnerability with minimal data to support rapid risk   assessment of fishing impacts on biodiversity","Journal of Applied Ecology","Large-bodied species are especially vulnerable to fishing in mixed fisheries. Their effective conservation requires predictions of sensitivity and exposure to fishing mortality, but such predictions are hard to make when the population dynamics of most of these species have not been described. We present a method for assessing sensitivity and conservation management reference points using widely available life-history data. The method allows the sensitivity of all fish species in a community to be assessed in relation to conservation- and yield-based fishery reference points. Knowledge of sensitivity is used to (i) rank species by sensitivity, (ii) conduct a risk assessment to identify species potentially vulnerable to current fishing pressure and (iii) examine potential trade-offs between fishery catches and the conservation status of sensitive species. The method is applied to the Celtic Sea bottom-dwelling fish community. For the species present, conservation threshold fishing mortalities ranged from 0·05 per year for the most sensitive large elasmobranchs to over 1 per year for small teleosts. The assessment predicts that current levels of fishing mortality may place all the elasmobranchs and over a quarter of the teleosts below conservation reference points. Depending on the relative mortality rates affecting commercially targeted species and species of conservation concern, up to 65% of the potential yield-per-recruit of commercially important species may have to be forgone to reduce fishing mortality below conservation limit reference points for the most sensitive species. Synthesis and applications. The method presented provides a clear objective procedure to construct ranked species sensitivity lists that can inform management, monitoring and research. The Celtic Sea case study demonstrated that limiting fishing pressure on key commercial stocks to meet fisheries production targets may be insufficient to guarantee the persistence of more sensitive species. Management actions that effectively decouple the mortality rates on commercial species and 'conservation' species are likely to be required to make progress in relation to conservation objectives. The method would support rapid assessment of sensitivity to fishing in many regions around the world as only taxonomic lists and estimates of body size are required. © 2011 Crown copyright.

1238,2012,"Modelling large-scale relationships between changes in woodland deer and   bird populations","Journal of Applied Ecology","There is increasing evidence from local studies carried out in several parts of the world to suggest that increases in the abundance of deer may be depressing population levels of breeding woodland bird populations that are associated with dense understorey habitats. We examine whether habitat modification by deer is likely to be a factor contributing to recent large-scale population declines of woodland birds in lowland England. Novel analytical methods are applied to extensive national bird and deer monitoring data, to examine whether populations of 11 woodland bird species that are associated with dense understorey habitats in lowland England may have been depressed following increases in the abundance of three widespread and abundant deer species: Reeves' muntjac Muntiacus reevesi, roe deer Capreolus capreolus and fallow deer Dama dama. An additional four woodland bird species that are not specifically associated with understorey habitats are included as controls. For five of the 11 understorey species considered, there is evidence that increases in deer are associated with large-scale depression of abundance or population declines in lowland England. Of these species, we suggest that the impacts of deer are likely to have been greatest for two species of conservation concern, common nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos and willow tit Poecile montanus. Synthesis and applications. Large-scale analyses of extensive national monitoring data provide evidence for a negative association between three widespread and abundant deer species and several woodland bird populations that are associated with dense understorey habitats. These findings are consistent with those from small-scale experimental studies and indicate that deer-related habitat modification may be affecting some bird species on far larger scales than previously appreciated. Mainly through their effects on understorey vegetation, high deer populations are now likely to be affecting woodland biodiversity over large parts of lowland England and deer management plans, involving integrated exclusion and culling of deer, need to be co-ordinated on large scales. It is suggested that such management plans could most usefully target areas that still support relatively high populations of species that are sensitive to deer. Knowledge about the form of relationships between deer abundance and habitat quality for birds and other biodiversity is an important knowledge gap that needs to be addressed if sound, collaborative deer management plans are to be developed. © 2011 The Authors.

1239,2017,"Cats, connectivity and conservation: incorporating data sets and   integrating scales for wildlife management","Journal of Applied Ecology","Understanding resource selection and quantifying habitat connectivity are fundamental to conservation planning for both land-use and species management plans. However, data sets available to management authorities for resource selection and connectivity analyses are often highly limited and fragmentary. As a result, measuring connectivity is challenging, and often poorly integrated within conservation planning and wildlife management. To exacerbate the challenge, scale-dependent resource use makes inference across scales problematic, resource use is often modelled in areas where the species is not present, and connectivity is typically measured using a source-to-sink approach, erroneously assuming animals possess predefined destinations. Here, we used a large carnivore, the leopard Panthera pardus, to characterise resource use and landscape connectivity across a vast, biodiverse region of southern Africa. Using a range of data sets to counter data deficiencies inherent in carnivore management, we overcame methodological limitations by employing occupancy modelling and resource selection functions across three orders of selection, and estimated landscape-scale habitat connectivity  independent of a priori source and sink locations  using circuit theory. We evaluated whether occupancy modelling on its own was capable of accurately informing habitat connectivity, and identified conservation priorities necessary for applied management. We detected markedly different scale-dependent relationships across all selection orders. Our multi-data, multi-scale approach accurately predicted resource use across multiple scales and demonstrates how management authorities can more suitably utilise fragmentary data sets. We further developed an unbiased landscape-scale depiction of habitat connectivity, and identified key linkages in need of targeted management. We did not find support for the use of occupancy modelling as a proxy for landscape-scale habitat connectivity and further caution its use within a management context. Synthesis and applications. Maintaining habitat connectivity remains a fundamental component of wildlife management and conservation, yet data to inform these biological and ecological processes are often scarce. We present a robust approach that incorporates multi-scale fragmentary data sets (e.g. mortality data, permit data, sightings data), routinely collected by management authorities, to inform wildlife management and land-use planning. We recommend that management authorities employ a multi-data, multi-scale connectivity approach  as we present here  to identify management units at risk of low connectivity.","10.1111/1365-2664.12851","Williams","Williams_1239",365,0.278084051568697,0.189124963259656,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1
1241,2017,"Prioritising seascape connectivity in conservation using network   analysis","Journal of Applied Ecology","Connectivity is regarded globally as a guiding principle for conservation planning, but due to difficulties in quantifying connectivity, empirical data remain scarce. Lack of meaningful connectivity metrics is likely leading to inadequate representation of important biological connections in reserve networks. Identifying patterns in landscape connectivity can, theoretically, improve the design of conservation areas. We used a network model to estimate seascape connectivity for coral reef-associated fishes in a subtropical bay in Australia. The model accounted for two scales of connectivity: (i) within mosaics at a local scale and (ii) among these mosaics at a regional scale. Connections among mosaics were modelled using estimations of post-larval small and intermediate movement distances represented by home ranges of two fish species. Modelled connectivity patterns were assessed with existing data on fish diversity. For fishes with intermediate home ranges (06 km), connectivity [quantified by the index Probability of Connectivity (dPC)] explained 5160% of species diversity. At smaller home ranges (01 km), species diversity was associated closely with intramosaic connectivity quantified by the index dPCintra. Mosaics and their region-wide connections were ranked for their contribution to overall seascape connectivity and compared against current positions and boundaries of reserves. Our matching shows that only three of the 10 most important mosaics are at least partly encompassed within a reserve, and only a single important regional connection lies within a reserve. Synthesis and applications. Notwithstanding its formal recognition in reserve planning, connectivity is rarely accounted for in practice, mainly because suitable metrics of connectivity are not available in planning phases. Here, we show how a network analysis can be effectively used in conservation planning by identifying biological connectivity inside and outside present reserve networks. Our results demonstrate clearly that connectivity is insufficiently represented within a reserve network. We also provide evidence of key pathways in need of protection to avoid nullifying the benefits of protecting key reefs. The guiding principle of protecting connections among habitats can be achieved more effectively in future, by formally incorporating our findings into the decision framework.","10.1111/1365-2664.12824","Williams","Williams_1241",333,0.269078662819631,0.270666968410284,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1
1244,2017,"Genetic erosion and escalating extinction risk in frogs with increasing   wildfire frequency","Journal of Applied Ecology","Wildfires are increasing in both frequency and intensity in many ecosystems, with climate change models predicting further escalations in fire-prone environments. Set against this background is the global decline of amphibians, with up to 40% of species facing extinction from multiple additive threats. Despite these disturbing figures, it is currently unclear how increasing fire frequency may impact the long-term persistence of frog populations. Following a severe wildfire in south-eastern Australia in 2009, field surveys indicated healthy tree frog populations. However, the 2009 fire had significant impacts on genetic diversity, including increased levels of inbreeding and declines in effective population size. Using stochastic population modelling under a range of fire-frequency scenarios, we demonstrate that amphibian populations in fire-prone environments may be increasingly vulnerable to extinction, particularly where rates of immigration are low. Synthesis and applications. This study of amphibian population genetics before and after a major wildfire emphasizes the importance of integrating both ecological and genetic data into population models. This will help managers make more appropriate conservation decisions regarding fire management of natural environments, especially those containing threatened populations. Priorities for agencies involved in planning controlled burns should consider carefully the timing of controlled burns, along with maintaining habitat connectivity.","10.1111/1365-2664.12809","Williams","Williams_1244",202,0.261448796068308,0.0645592960218289,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
1246,2017,"Avian pest control in vineyards is driven by interactions between bird   functional diversity and landscape heterogeneity","Journal of Applied Ecology","Insectivorous birds are increasingly recognized for the crucial pest control services they provide to agroecosystems. While both the foraging activity and functional diversity of birds are enhanced by multiscale habitat heterogeneity, little is known about how these relationships may influence avian top-down control of insects. Specifically, interactive effects of bird community structure and habitat heterogeneity on pest control across spatial scales have rarely been explored. We sampled bird communities and measured avian predation on plasticine model prey, as a proxy for lepidopteran pest control, in 20 vineyards of south-western France. Vineyards differed both in sward heterogeneity at the local scale and amount of surrounding semi-natural habitats at the landscape scale. Functional diversity metrics and community-weighted mean traits were computed for bird communities based on a speciestrait table including diet, foraging method, nesting site, migration strategy, laying date, home range size, clutch size and body mass. We used mixed models to test for the interacting effects of habitat heterogeneity and bird functional diversity on avian predation rates of plasticine prey. Contrary to expectations, bird functional diversity decreased with landscape-scale heterogeneity, but was higher in vineyards managed with heterogeneous sward structures. In contrast, foliage-gleaning insectivores were more abundant in landscapes supporting more semi-natural habitats, suggesting an increase in their contribution to pest control along the landscape heterogeneity gradient. Accordingly, we found that avian predation on plasticine prey increased with bird functional evenness both in more heterogeneous vineyards at the local scale and in landscape mosaics supporting more semi-natural habitats. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that habitat heterogeneity at both local and landscape scales influenced avian insectivory in vineyard agroecosystems by interacting with bird community structure. It provides important insights for ecological intensification in vineyards, pointing out that management options need to be adapted to both the functional composition of local bird communities and landscape context. We suggest that both on-field and off-field management can be used to enhance natural pest control services provided by birds in vineyards, especially by favouring sward heterogeneity and patches of semi-natural habitats within large vineyard stands at the landscape scale.","10.1111/1365-2664.12740","Williams","Williams_1246",355,0.308001008316465,0.232858702931534,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

We found significant differences among attitudes of stakeholders identifying major threats to wildlife, the use of science, the role of poaching in conservation, and the composition of species illegally traded. Policy makers and field officials differed in their views with NGOs and scientists on community response to wildlife policies and the varying threat perceptions to different species due to poaching and illegal trade. We noted ambiguity among stakeholders about sustainable use principles in India.

We analyzed I:A ratios in the daily harvest of dusky grouse (Dendragopus obscurus) and ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) in northeastern Oregon over 28 years (1981-2008) and found that I:A ratios in the harvest declined for both species as the hunting season progressed. We also analyzed ratios of adult female to adult male (AF:AM) grouse to determine if female and male grouse were harvested in equal numbers throughout the harvest season. We found that more males than females of both species were harvested, but that AF:AM ratio of both dusky and ruffed grouse did not change during most of the hunting season. Approximately 50% of the annual harvest occurred during the first 14 days of the hunting season.

We conducted a 3-year study (2007-2009) to determine the influence of CRP on fawn ecology during a time of declining CRP enrollment. We captured and radiocollared 81 fawn white-tailed deer during 15 May to 15 June 2007-2009 in north-central South Dakota, collected 6,505 locations, and documented 70 summer home ranges. Mean summer home ranges increased temporally during 2007-2009 (P<0.001) and corresponded to a 41% loss of CRP grasslands in the area (2.3% loss in land cover and approx. 21% loss in cover habitat in the study area) over the duration of the study. Additionally, mean movement between daily locations increased (P<0.001) from 2007 to 2009. Analysis of covariance models indicated that change in CRP influenced home-range size, and change in CRP and wheat influenced daily movement. Smaller home ranges and reduced movements were associated with greater quantity of CRP available to fawns, and increased movements were associated with more acreage of wheat available to fawns. Fawns shifted resource selection during the summer at a mean age ranging from 48.8 days to 58.6 days, and this shift was associated with height of corn (83-87cm). During early summer, fawns consistently selected for CRP; selection of wheat progressed temporally from avoidance in 2007 to selection in 2009. During late summer, fawns consistently selected for corn habitat and used CRP at least in proportion to its availability. Reduction in CRP-grasslands seemed to increase fawn home-range size and daily movements and, influenced change in resource selection to wheat. Current legislation mandates continued decrease in CRP enrollment and concomitant increase in the planting of corn for ethanol production. Management of habitat throughout the grasslands of the Northern Great Plains that maximizes cover habitats would provide neonates with adequate cover for protection from predators.

Specifically, we analyzed the isotopic composition of hair from bears known a priori to be food-conditioned or non-food-conditioned and used these data to predict whether bears with an unknown management status were food-conditioned (FC) or non-food-conditioned (NFC). We used a stable isotope mixing model to estimate the proportional contribution of natural foods (plants and animals) versus human food in the diets of FC bears. We then used results from both analyses to evaluate proactive (population-level) and reactive (individual-level) human-bear management, and discussed new metrics to evaluate the overall human-bear management program in Yosemite. Our results indicated that 19 out of 145 (13%) unknown bears sampled from 2005 to 2007 were food-conditioned. The proportion of human food in the diets of known FC bears likely declined from 2001-2003 to 2005-2007, suggesting proactive management was successful in reducing the amount of human food available to bears. In contrast, reactive management was not successful in changing the management status of known FC bears to NFC bears, or in reducing the contribution of human food to the diets of FC bears. Nine known FC bears were recaptured on 14 occasions from 2001 to 2007; all bears were classified as FC during subsequent recaptures, and human-bear management did not reduce the amount of human food in the diets of FC bears. Based on our results, we suggest Yosemite continue implementing proactive human-bear management, reevaluate reactive management, and consider removing problem bears (those involved in repeated bear incidents) from the population. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.318","Williams","Williams_1333",294,0.264966004292068,0.220405580621184,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Additionally, upland habitat characteristics may affect duckling survival rates but this potential relationship has largely been ignored. We evaluated several unresolved hypotheses about causes of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) duckling survival variation, with an emphasis on assessing effects of managed and remnant natural upland habitats. During 1993-2000, 617 radio-marked females provided information about brood habitat use and duckling survival on 27 sites in prairie Canada. We contrasted a priori and exploratory models that incorporated effects of upland, wetland, weather, female, and brood-related variables on duckling survival rates. Survival was highest for ducklings when a greater proportion of their surrounding landscape (i.e., within a 500-m radius buffer around the brood) was comprised of wetlands characterized by a central expanse of open water and a peripheral ring of flooded emergent vegetation. Cold and wet weather in the first week of life resulted in lower duckling survival. In a post hoc analysis, duckling survival (of older ducklings) was negatively related to increasing proportions of managed hayland. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.297","Williams","Williams_1334",179,0.115329307475576,0.0277727157789064,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0
1335,2012,"Estimating breeding season abundance of golden-cheeked warblers in   Texas, USA","Journal of Wildlife Management","Population abundance estimates using predictive models are important for describing habitat use and responses to population-level impacts, evaluating conservation status of a species, and for establishing monitoring programs. The golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) is a neotropical migratory bird that was listed as federally endangered in 1990 because of threats related to loss and fragmentation of its woodland habitat. Since listing, abundance estimates for the species have mainly relied on localized population studies on public lands and qualitative-based methods. Our goal was to estimate breeding population size of male warblers using a predictive model based on metrics for patches of woodland habitat throughout the species' breeding range. We first conducted occupancy surveys to determine range-wide distribution. We then conducted standard point-count surveys on a subset of the initial sampling locations to estimate density of males. Mean observed patch-specific density was 0.23 males/ha (95% CI = 0.197-0.252, n = 301). We modeled the relationship between patch-specific density of males and woodland patch characteristics (size and landscape composition) and predicted patch occupancy. The probability of patch occupancy, derived from a model that used patch size and landscape composition as predictor variables while addressing effects of spatial relatedness, best predicted patch-specific density. We predicted patch-specific densities as a function of occupancy probability and estimated abundance of male warblers across 63,616 woodland patches accounting for 1.678 million ha of potential warbler habitat. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, our approach yielded a range-wide male warbler population estimate of 263,339 (95% CI: 223,927-302,620). Our results provide the first abundance estimate using habitat and count data from a sampling design focused on range-wide inference.

1337,2012,"Harvest of red-legged partridge in central Spain","Journal of Wildlife Management","A basic rule to attain sustainable use of harvested resources is to adjust take to availability. Populations of red-legged partridges in Spain have decreased in recent decades, and releases of farm-bred partridges to improve short-term availability are increasingly common. We used questionnaires and bird surveys to assess whether harvest was related to availability of wild partridges or intensity of farm-bred partridge releases. We studied 50 hunting estates, including 6 administratively labeled as intensive (with few numerical and temporal restrictions to releases). In addition, we considered hunting pressure (number of huntersá - hunting days/km 2) and habitat as explanatory variables in the analyses. In intensive estates, annual harvest was exclusively related to release intensity, indicating that in these estates hunting is detached from natural resources and approaches an industrial activity based on external inputs. In non-intensive estates, harvest was affected by wild stock availability, walked-up shooting pressure, and habitat (greater harvest in estates with more Mediterranean shrubland). In these estates, releases did not increase annual harvest, and can be considered an inefficient practice. Additionally, the relationship between abundance estimates and harvest disappeared in estates with low partridge abundance estimates, suggesting possibilities for overharvesting in a large proportion of estates. Increasing the abundance of wild red-legged partridge through techniques like habitat management, and improving the adjustment of harvest to availability, may be a good strategy to increase long-term harvest in non-intensive estates. Additionally, Government and managers must create ways to segregate and label the estates where only wild red-legged partridges are managed from those where releases are used, to reduce ecological costs of management decisions. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

1338,2012,"Predation by coyotes on white-tailed deer neonates in South Carolina","Journal of Wildlife Management","Coyotes (Canis latrans) are novel predators throughout the southeastern United States and their depredation of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) neonates may explain observed declines in some deer populations in the region, but direct evidence for such a relationship is lacking. Our objective was to quantify neonate survival rates and causes of mortality at the United States Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina to directly evaluate degree of predation in this deer population. From 2006 to 2009, we radio-monitored 91 neonates captured with the aid of vaginal implant transmitters in pregnant adult females and opportunistic searches. Overall Kaplan-Meier survival rate to 16 weeks of age was 0.230 (95% CI=0.155-0.328), and it varied little among years. Our best-fitting model estimated survival at 0.220 (95% CI=0.144-0.320). This model included a quadratic time trend variable (lowest survival rate during the first week of life and increasing to near 1.000 around week 10), and Julian date of birth (survival probability declining as date of birth increased). Predation by coyotes was the most frequent cause of death among the 70 monitored neonates that died, definitively accounting for 37% of all mortalities and potentially accounting for as much as 80% when also including probable coyote predation. Predation by bobcats (Felis rufus) accounted for 7% (definitive) to 9% (including probable bobcat predation) of mortalities. The level of coyote-induced mortality we observed is consistent with the low recruitment rates exhibited in the SRS deer population since establishment of coyotes at the site. If representative of recruitment rates across South Carolina, current harvest levels appear unsustainable. This understanding is consistent with the recent declining trend in the statewide deer population. The effects of coyote predation on recruitment should be considered when setting harvest goals, regardless of whether local deer population size is currently above or below desired levels, because coyotes can substantially reduce fawn recruitment.

Permitted wildlife rehabilitators routinely treat cat-caused injuries. However, extent of these activities is under-reported in the scientific literature. To determine incidence, age class, mortality, diversity and frequency of species affected, nature of injuries, time in care, and temporal and geospatial trends associated with interactions between free-roaming cats and wildlife, we conducted a retrospective analysis on 20,921 records from small birds and mammals presented to the Wildlife Center of Virginia (WCV), USA between 2000 and 2010. Cat interaction was the second greatest cause of small-mammal admissions (14.8%), fourth greatest cause of mammal mortality (70.8%), fourth greatest cause of bird admissions (13.7%), and second greatest cause of avian mortality (80.8%). Eighty-three species were admitted following interactions with cats. Age of wildlife admitted following cat interaction varied by class; juvenile mammals were captured most frequently (40.5%), followed by neonates (34%), then adults (25.5%). However, adults were documented most frequently in birds (42.7%), followed by juveniles (37.2%), then nestlings (20.1%). Birds were more likely to have interactions with cats in rural areas, whereas degree of urbanization did not differ for mammals. Eighty-eight percent of cat interactions occurred between April and September, indicating a strong seasonal trend. Our findings indicate that free-roaming cats substantially contribute to admissions in a wildlife rehabilitation hospital and even with veterinary intervention, release potential is limited. Reducing the number of free-roaming cats will reduce interactions with wildlife and decrease the need for medical assistance. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21181","Williams","Williams_1339",254,0.136954166254034,0.14668080303579,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
1340,2017,"Sustainability of the grizzly bear hunt in British Columbia, Canada","Journal of Wildlife Management","The sustainability of the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) hunt in British Columbia, Canada has been questioned and is a high profile issue, particularly in the media. To investigate the hypothesis that the hunt is unsustainable, we examined the sustainable human-caused mortality rate for grizzly bears using recent data on vital rates and population projection models and compare these to rates used by the management agency; examined the age and sex ratio of the kill and how the sex ratio changes with age for the entire province, each population unit, and cohorts born each year between 1977 and 1990; summarized population density estimates in hunted population units in British Columbia and compared these to unhunted areas in adjacent jurisdictions; and reviewed case studies of population units that have been highlighted as most likely to have had unsustainable kill levels. Because the natural mortality rate of adult grizzly bears is 12% and lower than was estimated when sustainable human-caused mortality targets were developed, estimated sustainable kill rates are 410%, and generally higher than the 46% used in British Columbia. We estimated that males have been 34 times more vulnerable to being killed by hunters than females, yet males dominate the kill at all ages and the proportion of males increased with age, which is opposite of what is predicted for a heavily hunted population. The average age of female and male grizzly bears killed by hunters increased from 7.1 years and 7.4 years, respectively, in the 1980s to 7.7 years and 8.7 years, respectively, in the 2000s. An average of 107.4 females and 204.9 males per cohort born between 1977 and 1990 were eventually killed by people and recorded, suggesting that many more females than males died for unknown reasons. There have been more population inventories of grizzly bears in British Columbia than in any other jurisdiction. The average density estimate of 21 inventories in hunted areas without salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in British Columbia (31.2 bears/1,000 km2) was as high as or higher than nearby unhunted areas. The case studies had the highest kill densities or among the highest kill rates in the province and hunting targets were commonly exceeded and seasons closed or the hunter kill target reduced. Although population inventories in these areas found moderate or even high densities of bears, some are now in decline. Hunter kill data from declining populations had a high proportion of males and these were older, demonstrating that these indices of kill rates are sometimes unreliable. Although more population density, trend, and vital rate measurements would be beneficial, the hypothesis that the grizzly bear hunt has been unsustainable was not supported by our investigation of available information. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21189","Williams","Williams_1340",432,0.254435313000939,-0.2547339054726,"350","negative","negative_350",0
1341,2017,"Low breeding propensity and wide-ranging movements by marbled murrelets   in Washington","Journal of Wildlife Management","The marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is a threatened seabird that forages in nearshore marine waters but nests inland, commonly in older coniferous forests. Information on ranging behavior and breeding propensity can be useful for informing management, especially when comparisons can be made between declining or threatened populations and more stable, unthreatened populations. Over 5 years, we measured ranging behavior and breeding propensity of marbled murrelets in Washington, USA where murrelets are considered threatened. Our primary objective was to compare space use and breeding by murrelets in Washington with those from other regions and where the species is not considered threatened. We radio tracked 157 murrelets from 2004 to 2008. Median marine 95% kernel ranges were 487 km2 (Formula presented.) and larger than those reported for non-threatened populations in Alaska, USA in other studies. Ranges computed from minimum convex polygons (MCPs; median = 404 km2; (Formula presented) were on average similar to those reported for threatened populations in California, USA, although larger than those reported for Alaska. Distances traveled between consecutive marine telemetry locations were greater than reported previously in Alaska. Variation in movements in our study were not associated with oceanographic conditions although appeared greater for murrelets captured along the Pacific Coast compared to those occupying interior marine waters in the Salish Sea. Twenty individuals (12.7%) attempted to breed in our study, and we estimated breeding propensity was 13.120.0%. This is the lowest breeding propensity reported for a population of murrelets to date. For breeders, nest-sea commuting distances were greater than reported previously, with 4 breeders traveling farther than the previously reported maximum of 125 km. The low breeding propensity, large marine ranges, and long nest-sea commutes in this study may point to poor-quality marine habitat in Washington compared to other parts of the murrelet's range. In combination with reported declines in terrestrial nesting habitat from other studies, this indicates that additional management is needed to improve murrelet breeding habitat in Washington. Future management actions should focus on improving both terrestrial and marine habitat. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21192","Williams","Williams_1341",329,0.212507516707517,0.124684413928441,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
1342,2017,"Demography of an Increasing Caribou Herd With Restricted Wolf Control","Journal of Wildlife Management","Understanding the limiting factors of a prey population is important before and during predator control programs, and optimal intensive management of an increasing prey population requires formal recognition of a sustainable population size. The migratory Fortymile caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herd in Alaska reached a low of approximately 6,000 caribou during 19731975. To regain peak numbers of approximately 50,000 caribou estimated in the 1960s, stakeholder groups gained approval for conservative harvest rates (19732013) and periods of restricted nonlethal (19982004) and lethal wolf (Canis lupus) control (20052013). We studied demography of the herd using radio-telemetry during 19902014, when herd size increased from about 22,000 to 52,000 caribou. Parturition rates in the early 1990s were among the highest reported, but parturition rates of primiparous females subsequently declined to a level indicating resource-limitation as caribou numbers approached and then exceeded 50,000. This and companion studies documented several other cautionary signals to an eventual decline, including declining October calf weights, early summer movement off the alpine and subalpine tundra to lower elevation sprucemoss taiga, relatively high caribou densities, a nearly 40-year history of increasing caribou numbers, and a return to previous peak numbers. We studied mortality of calves and older females during the 4 years before wolf control and the first 5 years of nonlethal wolf control. During those 9 years, annual mortality rates averaged 54% for calves and 9% for adult females. We detected no convincing support for decreased wolf predation during nonlethal control. We also detected no support for increased caribou survival during nonlethal or lethal wolf control. Based on counts of caribou during summer aggregations using a total search photocensus technique, rate of herd increase ( r) was negligible ( r = 1.00) during 19901995, highest during the 3 years immediately before nonlethal wolf control ( r = 1.11, 19951998), moderate during nonlethal wolf control ( r = 1.07, 19982003), and low during the period that included the first 5 years of lethal wolf control ( r = 1.02, 20032010). We combined observed cause of death with the 9 annual modeled starting populations (all newborn calves and adults) and estimated that wolves killed 1015% of the populations annually, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) killed 47%, other predators killed 24%, nonpredation factors killed 12%, and hunters killed =2%. Wolves killed 59% of the annual populations as calves and 56% as adults. In retrospect, nonlethal wolf control efforts were too localized to decrease wolf numbers (e.g., adjacent untreated wolf packs reached max. mean numbers). Lethal wolf control efforts had only seasonal and localized effects on wolf numbers. It is important that stakeholders focus on describing a preferred, sustainable herd size, or nutritional status and proceed toward managing this increasing herd in a sustainable manner because, when ungulates overshoot carrying capacity, the effects of high density, adverse weather, and increased predation can have synergistic negative effects on prey numbers and long-lasting negative effects on sustainable yields, contrary to the intended purpose of the wolf control programs. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21209","Williams","Williams_1342",456,0.280994237123096,-0.106938728163598,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Dispersing wolves from Canada naturally recolonized Montana and first denned there in 1986. In 1995 and 1996, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service reintroduced 66 wolves into central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park. By 2008, there were =1,655 wolves in =217 packs, including 95 breeding pairs in the NRM. From 19932008, we captured and radio-collared 1,681 wolves and documented 297 radio-collared wolves dispersing as lone individuals. We monitored dispersing wolves to determine their pack characteristics (i.e., pack size and surrounding pack density) before and after dispersal, their reproductive success, and eventual fate. We calculated summary statistics for characteristics of wolf dispersal (i.e., straight-line distance, age, time of year, sex ratio, reproduction, and survival), and we tested these characteristics for differences between sexes and age groups. Approximately, 10% of the known wolf population dispersed annually. The sex ratio of dispersals favored males (169 M, 128 F), but fewer dispersed males reproduced (28%, n = 47) than females (42%, n = 54). Fifty-nine percent of all dispersers of known age were adults (n = 156), 37% were yearlings (n = 99), and 4% were pups (n = 10). Mean age at dispersal for males (32.8 months) was not significantly different (P = 0.88) than for females (32.1 months). Yellowstone National Park had a significant positive effect on dispersal rate. Pack density in a wolf's natal population had a negative effect on dispersal rate when the entire NRM population was considered. The mean NRM pack size (6.9) from 1993 to 2008 was smaller than the mean size of packs (10.0) from which wolves dispersed during that time period (P 300 km. On average, dispersal distance decreased later in the study (P = 0.006). Sex, survival rate in the natal population, start date, dispersal distance, and direction were not significant predictors of dispersal rate or successful dispersal. Wolves that formed new packs were >11 times more likely to reproduce than those that joined packs and surrounding pack density had a negative effect on successful dispersal. Dispersal behavior seems to be innate in sexually mature wolves and thereby assures that genetic diversity will remain high and help conserve the NRM wolf population. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21238","Williams","Williams_1343",346,0.183275207609864,0.122114871344993,"350","neutral","neutral_350",0
1344,2017,"Predictable features attract urban coyotes to residential yards","Journal of Wildlife Management","Several species of urban-adapted carnivores, including coyotes (Canis latrans), use anthropogenic resources in residential areas, which may increase rates of encounters and conflict with people. These negative interactions might be reduced with more understanding of individual variation in the use of residential areas and if attractants were better predicted by residents and targeted for securement or removal. We fitted 19 urban coyotes with global positioning system (GPS) collars (11 healthy, 8 with sarcoptic mange [Sarcoptes scabiei]) and compared their selection for residential areas at different times of day. We also identified 173 clusters of GPS locations (representing foraging and bedding sites) and paired them with available sites to measure selection for anthropogenic food, shelter, and visual cover. Seventeen of 19 coyotes avoided residential areas in general, but lesser avoidance of residential areas occurred in animals that used these areas during the day. Backyards selected by coyotes were 66.7 times less likely to have fences, 22.2 times more likely to contain anthropogenic food, and had 3.3 times as much visual cover than available yards. Diseased coyotes were 9 times more likely than healthy animals to select for yards with anthropogenic food. Our results suggest that coarse measurements of habitat selection via land cover classes may underestimate the attraction to wildlife of particular features in residential areas. Greater management of these features by municipal governments, residents, and communities might reduce animal use, disease transmission, and human-wildlife conflict for diverse species in urban areas. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21223","Williams","Williams_1344",237,0.264755607208369,0.0792974879652706,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
1345,2017,"Removal of an exotic fish influences amphibian breeding site selection","Journal of Wildlife Management","For pond-breeding species, the distribution of larvae is a reflection of habitat suitability and adult breeding site selection. Some species preferentially breed in ephemeral ponds, which can provide benefits for larvae. An alternative strategy used by adults to increase offspring survival is to detect aquatic predators and avoid them when selecting breeding sites. We investigated whether either of these types of breeding site selection are contributing to the negative correlation between the distributions of tadpoles of the threatened green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) and the introduced eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) in Sydney, Australia. From 2003 to 2012 we drained ponds to temporarily remove gambusia and examined the effect of removal on the numbers of male, female, and juvenile frogs, and tadpoles. We found that males preferentially selected fish-free ponds as breeding sites. In addition, the removal of gambusia increased tadpole abundance to over 140 times that of an undrained pond. Pond draining did not influence female or juvenile abundances. The ability to detect and avoid gambusia may be mitigating the effect of predation to a certain extent. We conclude that pond draining to remove exotic fish is an effective strategy that can be used to greatly increase the reproductive success of this and potentially other threatened amphibian species in the presence of exotic predators. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21232","Williams","Williams_1345",218,0.233237749377448,0.191647601972316,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
1346,2017,"Growth of Black Brant and Lesser Snow Goose Goslings in Northern Alaska","Journal of Wildlife Management","Gosling body mass can affect first year survival, recruitment, adult body size, and future fecundity of geese, and can serve as an indicator of forage availability and quality on brood-rearing areas. From 20122014 we measured body mass of 76 black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) and 268 lesser snow goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) goslings of known age on the Colville River Delta (CRD) of northern Alaska to determine if there was evidence of density-dependent declines in gosling growth following recent population increases of those species and sympatric greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis). We contrasted contemporary body mass of brant goslings and forage biomass in brood-rearing habitats that were shared by all species, with measures obtained on, and near the CRD in the 1990s, prior to the establishment of snow goose nesting colonies in the area. Body mass of brant goslings recaptured between 25 and 32 days of age had not changed over the past 2 decades, despite an influx of snow geese, and increases in populations of brant and white-fronted geese. At 30 days of age, body mass of brant goslings on the CRD was 100400 g heavier than for brant goslings of the same age on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD), Alaska. Contemporary biomass of grazed Carex subspathacea on CRD brood-rearing areas was comparable to the 1990s and was 24 times greater than for the same plant community on the YKD. Historical data on growth of snow goose goslings were not available for the CRD. However, average body mass of 34-day-old snow goose goslings was >230 g heavier than for conspecifics of the same age in the Hudson Bay region. We conclude that the establishment of nesting snow geese on the CRD has not negatively affected brant gosling growth, and that recent population increases of all species have likely not been constrained by forage availability on brood-rearing areas. Barring demographic changes elsewhere in their annual cycles, we predict that goose populations will continue to increase in northern Alaska. However, snow geese are increasing more rapidly than brant in the region. Because the black brant population has periodically been below conservation objectives, the effects of the increasing number of snow geese on forage biomass and growth of brant goslings in northern Alaska should be monitored. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21246","Williams","Williams_1346",376,0.0944264178624294,0.116335245407621,"350","neutral","neutral_350",1

Our objective was to describe the temporal pattern of train accidents related to wild ungulates (i.e., roe deer [Capreolus capreolus], red deer [Cervus elaphus], moose [Alces alces], and wild boar [Sus scrofa]) to determine when the risk of collision is highest. We gathered data on train collisions with wild ungulates throughout Poland between 2012 and 2015 from Polish Railways Polskie Koleje Panstwowe SA. We used generalized additive mixed models to investigate whether the number of collisions changed over time. The number of wildlife-train collisions varied depending on time of year. Most collisions occurred in autumn when animals form winter herds and migrate to and stay in winter refugia. The fewest collisions occurred in summer during breeding season. For all species except red deer, the number of collisions was significantly lower during weekends compared to weekdays. The distribution of collisions with regard to time of day was significantly different from simulated uniform random distribution, with peaks before dawn and after dusk, which reflect activity peaks of ungulates. During the day, the probability of collision was lower, with only single events observed between 0800 and 1600. We observed another collision-free period after midnight until 0400, probably because train traffic was minimal during this period. Most train collisions with ungulates took place in relatively narrow time windows in terms of time of year and time of day (i.e., 50% of the recorded cases took place in ~17% of the total time observed). Consequently, mitigation measures of lowering speed limits can be applied during times when the risk of collision is highest. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","10.1002/jwmg.21311","Williams","Williams_1348",276,0.175172891241331,-0.0559092530337906,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0
1385,2017,"Large conservation gains possible for global biodiversity facets","Nature","Different facets of biodiversity other than species numbers are increasingly appreciated as critical for maintaining the function of ecosystems and their services to humans. While new international policy and assessment processes such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) recognize the importance of an increasingly global, quantitative and comprehensive approach to biodiversity protection, most insights are still focused on a single facet of biodiversity - species. Here we broaden the focus and provide an evaluation of how much of the world's species, functional and phylogenetic diversity of birds and mammals is currently protected and the scope for improvement. We show that the large existing gaps in the coverage for each facet of diversity could be remedied by a slight expansion of protected areas: an additional 5% of the land has the potential to more than triple the protected range of species or phylogenetic or functional units. Further, the same areas are often priorities for multiple diversity facets and for both taxa. However, we find that the choice of conservation strategy has a fundamental effect on outcomes. It is more difficult (that is, requires more land) to maximize basic representation of the global biodiversity pool than to maximize local diversity. Overall, species and phylogenetic priorities are more similar to each other than they are to functional priorities, and priorities for the different bird biodiversity facets are more similar than those of mammals. Our work shows that large gains in biodiversity protection are possible, while also highlighting the need to explicitly link desired conservation objectives and biodiversity metrics. We provide a framework and quantitative tools to advance these goals for multi-faceted biodiversity conservation.","10.1038/nature22368","Williams","Williams_1385",275,0.297019340904532,0.3760248028783,"300","neutral","neutral_300",0

Species that live in the centre of the forest (forest core), that were more likely to be listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), reached peak abundances only at sites farther than 200-400 m from sharp high-contrast forest edges. Smaller-bodied amphibians, larger reptiles and medium-sized non-volant mammals experienced a larger reduction in suitable habitat than other forest-core species.

Guanacos have declined because of competition with sheep for forage, high hunting pressure and habitat degradation. Península Valdés is a protected area where sheep ranching is the predominant activity. A ranch formerly dedicated to sheep production was converted into a private wildlife reserve, from which all the sheep were removed in 2005. We studied changes in guanaco abundance inside and outside the reserve after sheep removal, and also plant cover of various vegetation types. We found that guanaco abundance was higher inside than outside the reserve, and increased by three-fold within 3 years. Total plant cover and grass cover were higher inside than outside the reserve. Our results showed that guanacos reacted rapidly to changes in management, and suggest that even at a high density guanacos would not be as damaging to the vegetation as sheep. Although management changes resulted in significant changes in guanaco abundance locally, the size of a protected area influences the persistence of wild populations. A large herbivore such as the guanaco needs to be managed across large areas. We believe it is necessary to implement a management plan for Península Valdés that allows for the coexistence of sustainable livestock production and healthy wildlife populations. © 2012 Fauna & Flora Internationa.","10.1017/S0030605311000214","Williams","Williams_1423",223,0.338373375497915,0.154138993663273,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Most populations appeared to have declined in the small fragments but primate abundance has increased significantly in the largest fragment over the last decade.

As data on the pre-hunting state of mammal populations in Africa are not generally available, we evaluated the impacts of illegal bushmeat hunting on the mammal community of two ecologically similar forests in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania. The forests differ only in their protection status: One is a National Park and the other a Forest Reserve. We deployed systematic camera trap surveys in these forests, amounting to 850 and 917 camera days in the Forest Reserve and the National Park, respectively, and investigated differences between the two areas in estimated species-specific occupancies, detectabilities and species richness. We show that the mammal community in the Forest Reserve is degraded in all aspects relative to the National Park. Species richness was almost 40% lower in the Forest Reserve (median 18 vs 29 species, highest posterior density intervals 15-30 and 23-47, respectively). Occupancy of most species was also reduced significantly and the functional community appeared significantly altered, with an increase in rodents, and loss of large carnivores and omnivores. Overall, our results show how ineffective reserve management, with almost absent law enforcement, leads to uncontrolled illegal hunting, which in turn has a significant impact on the mammal fauna of globally important sites for conservation.","10.1017/S0030605315000836","Williams","Williams_1433",222,0.29905278136037,0.102036409553584,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Annual survival probability over a 5-year interval was 78% (95% CI 58-98) and the recapture probability was 62% (95% CI 42-79). Although our results are among the highest densities reported for the jaguar in this biome, the future of the population is threatened by genetic deterioration and local threats, including the expansion of an existing highway and depletion of the jaguar's native prey base as a result of poaching, and will depend upon urgent implementation of conservation actions. The necessary actions include establishing gene flow with other compatible populations, increasing surveillance against poaching, continuing population monitoring of jaguars and their main prey species, and implementing mitigation measures in relation to the impacts of the highway on local fauna.","10.1017/S0030605315001222","Williams","Williams_1435",180,0.174309189640571,-0.00619221668221193,"200","neutral","neutral_200",0

Estimating the potential distribution of threatened species to guide surveys and conservation is crucial, primarily because such species tend to exist in small fragmented populations. The Endangered huemul deer Hippocamelus bisulcus is endemic to the southern Andes of Chile and Argentina. Although the species occurs in the Valdivian Ecoregion, a hotspot for biodiversity, we have no information on its occupancy and potential distribution in this region. We built and compared species distribution models for huemul using the maximum entropy approach, using 258 presence records and sets of bioclimatic and geographical variables as predictors, with the objective of assessing the potential distribution of the species in the Valdivian Ecoregion. Annual temperature range and summer precipitation were the predictive variables with the greatest influence in the best-fitting model. Approximately 12,360 km2 of the study area was identified as suitable habitat for the huemul, of which 30% is included in the national protected area systems of Chile and Argentina. The map of potential distribution produced by our model will facilitate prioritization of future survey efforts in other remote and unexplored areas in which huemul have not been recorded since the 1980s but where there is a high probability of their occurrence.","10.1017/S0030605315001106","Williams","Williams_1436",209,0.275437106137975,0.0714820844771244,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

China has the largest extent of potential snow leopard habitat and is thus crucial for snow leopard conservation. There are many challenges to snow leopard conservation in China, however, and there is still little information on the species for many geographical locations, including the Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang province, which are important because they potentially connect snow leopard populations in Krygyzstan and Kazakhstan with those in Mongolia. We used camera traps in four areas across eastern, central and western Tianshan, with a total survey effort of 3,216 camera-Trapping days. We confirmed the presence of snow leopards and an abundance of potential snow leopard prey, including the Siberian ibex Capra sibirica, in all areas. We found 2-3 individual adult snow leopards at each site, with relatively limited survey effort, and more study is needed to fully investigate the importance of the Tianshan Mountains for the species.

1442,2017,"Conservation payments in a social context: determinants of tolerance and   behavioural intentions towards wild cats in northern Belize","ORYX","Carnivores are valued by conservationists globally but protecting them can impose direct costs on rural, livestock-dependent communities. Financial incentives are increasingly used with the goal of increasing people's tolerance of predators, but the definition of tolerance has been vague and inconsistent. Empirical correlations between attitudinal and behavioural measures of tolerance imply that attitudes may be a valid proxy for behaviours. However, theoretical differences between the concepts suggest that attitudinal tolerance and behavioural intention to kill cats would have different underlying determinants. We surveyed 112 residents within a forest-farm mosaic in northern Belize inhabited by jaguars Panthera onca and four other species of wild cats. A conservation payment programme pays local landowners when camera traps record cat presence on their land. Results indicated that tolerance was associated with gender and participation in the camera-Trapping programme, whereas intention to kill cats was associated with cultural group (Mennonites vs Mestizos), presence of children in the home and, to a lesser extent, tolerance. Neither dependent variable was significantly related to depredation losses or economic factors. Results suggest that monetary payments alone are unlikely to affect attitudes and behaviours towards carnivores. Payment programmes may be enhanced by accentuating non-monetary incentives, leveraging social norms and targeting specific groups with information about risks and benefits associated with carnivores. By empirically separating two concepts commonly conflated as 'tolerance' we clarify understanding of how social forces interact with financial incentives to shape people's relationships with predators.","10.1017/S0030605316000545","Williams","Williams_1442",240,0.355532779258747,-0.0631823673202282,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

However, due to the unprecedented rapidity of projected climatic changes, some species may not be able to move their ranges fast enough to track shifts in suitable climates and associated habitats. Here, we investigate the ability of 493 mammals to keep pace with projected climatic changes in the Western Hemisphere. We modeled the velocities at which species will likely need to move to keep pace with projected changes in suitable climates. We compared these velocities with the velocities at which species are able to move as a function of dispersal distances and dispersal frequencies. Across the Western Hemisphere, on average, 9.2% of mammals at a given location will likely be unable to keep pace with climate change. In some places, up to 39% of mammals may be unable to track shifts in suitable climates. Eighty-seven percent of mammalian species are expected to experience reductions in range size and 20% of these range reductions will likely be due to limited dispersal abilities as opposed to reductions in the area of suitable climate. Because climate change will likely outpace the response capacity of many mammals, mammalian vulnerability to climate change may be more extensive than previously anticipated.","10.1073/pnas.1116791109","Williams","Williams_1475",213,0.126627252371904,0.00526189021561373,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Using a newly assembled and taxonomically expansive database, we analyzed the relationships between extinction risk and body mass (27,647 species) and between extinction risk and range size (21,294 species) for vertebrates across six main classes. We found that the probability of being threatened was positively and significantly related to body mass for birds, cartilaginous fishes, and mammals. Bimodal relationships were evident for amphibians, reptiles, and bony fishes. Most importantly, a bimodal relationship was found across all vertebrates such that extinction risk changes around a body mass breakpoint of 0.035 kg, indicating that the lightest and heaviest vertebrates have elevated extinction risk. We also found range size to be an important predictor of the probability of being threatened, with strong negative relationships across nearly all taxa. A review of the drivers of extinction risk revealed that the heaviest vertebrates are most threatened by direct killing by humans. By contrast, the lightest vertebrates are most threatened by habitat loss and modification stemming especially from pollution, agricultural cropping, and logging. Our results offer insight into halting the ongoing wave of vertebrate extinctions by revealing the vulnerability of large and small taxa, and identifying size-specific threats. Moreover, they indicate that, without intervention, anthropogenic activities will soon precipitate a double truncation of the size distribution of the worlds vertebrates, fundamentally reordering the structure of life on our planet.","10.1073/pnas.1702078114","Williams","Williams_1479",247,0.280251203682789,-0.0728887703544726,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0

Ecosystem restoration is required to mitigate these damages and losses, but its practice is in its infancy in the region. Here we demonstrate that species diversity can set the trajectory of restoration. In a seagrass restoration experiment in the heart of the Coral Triangle (Sulawesi, Indonesia), plant survival and coverage increased with the number of species transplanted. Our results highlight the positive role biodiversity can play in ecosystem restoration and call for revision of the common restoration practice of establishing a single target species, particularly in regions having high biodiversity.

Results demonstrate that species with more fragmentation are at greater risk of extinction, even after accounting for the effects of key macroecological predictors, such as body size and geographic range size. Species with higher fragmentation had smaller ranges and a lower proportion of high-suitability habitat within their range, and most high-suitability habitat occurred outside of protected areas, further elevating extinction risk.

To ensure that priorities are biologically comprehensive, multiple dimensions of diversity must be considered. Further, understanding how the different dimensions relate to one another spatially is important for conservation prioritization, but the relationship remains poorly understood. Here, we use spatial conservation planning to (i) identify and compare priority regions for global mammal conservation across three key dimensions of biodiversity - taxonomic, phylogenetic, and traits - and (ii) determine the overlap of these regions with the locations of threatened species and existing protected areas. We show that priority areas for mammal conservation exhibit low overlap across the three dimensions, highlighting the need for an integrative approach for biodiversity conservation. Additionally, currently protected areas poorly represent the three dimensions of mammalian biodiversity. We identify areas of high conservation priority among and across the dimensions that should receive special attention for expanding the global protected area network. These high-priority areas, combined with areas of high priority for other taxonomic groups and with social, economic, and political considerations, provide a biological foundation for future conservation planning efforts.","10.1073/pnas.1706461114","Williams","Williams_1483",197,0.328127054158762,0.467673588665482,"200","positive","positive_200",0

This study modelled the spatial effects of organic farming (intensity of local farming systems), environmental heterogeneity, and urbanisation on two widely studied environmental taxa â vascular plant and bird species richness (surrogate measures of biodiversity) â in south australia, using a unique certified organic farming postcode level dataset from 2001 to 2016 (n = 5440). The spatial durbin error model results confirmed the positive spatial congruence of organic farming with greater vascular plant species richness, whereas only weak to no significant evidence was found for bird species richness. Landscape features (habitat heterogeneity) and green vegetation (a proxy indicator of resource availability) â rather than organic farming â appeared to be most associated with bird species richness. Both plant and bird species richness were positively associated with habitat heterogeneity (land cover diversity and elevation range), plant productivity and proportion of conservation land and water bodies. Whereas, increased anthropogenic land use for cropping and horticultural farming, soil type diversity and proximity to the coast significantly reduced species richness of both taxa. The results suggest that a multi-scale spatially refined biodiversity conservation strategy, with spatial targeting that promotes low intensive farming systems and increases landscape heterogeneity to provide quality habitat (a whole of landscape approach by incorporating private agricultural landholders), could be beneficial for biodiversity conservation.

However, captive-reared animals are often raised in conditions dissimilar to their release sites and lacking natural characteristics, which could alter movement patterns and postrelease survivorship. These patterns can be further altered by season of release and soft-release conditions. We reared juvenile eastern hellbenders (cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis) for 18 mo in captivity in one of two conditions: a control condition with low-velocity water flow (unconditioned) or a treatment condition with moving water (conditioned) that simulated natural flow velocities at their intended release site. We divided 4-yr-old hellbenders (n = 118) into six treatment groups to determine the effects of release season (fall or summer), release type (standard soft release or enhanced soft release), and conditioning (unconditioned or conditioned) on the number of days until first movement, release site retention, and survival. In november 2017, we released 80 radio-tagged individuals (40 conditioned and 40 unconditioned) into soft-release structures in the blue river, indiana. In july 2018, we released another 38 radio-tagged individuals (18 conditioned and 20 unconditioned) into soft-release structures at the same site. After release, we tracked each individual one to three times weekly for 10 mo (fall release) or 12 mo (summer release). We found that treatment groups released into caged cobble beds (i.e., enhanced soft release) delayed their first movement and had higher release site retention relative to groups released under caged shelter rocks (i.e., standard soft release). We found that conditioning had a positive effect on survival but only in the treatment group released in the summer. By combining techniques and releasing conditioned individuals in the summer using enhanced soft releases, we increased annual survival of captive-reared hellbenders from a probability of 0.50 (95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.31-0.79) to 0.74 (95% ci = 0.55-0.99). Our results provide important information about techniques that can be adopted across captive-rearing programs to help maximize the conservation success of eastern hellbenders.

It has been determined that the effect of climate change on wildlife population will accelerate the rate and process of decline of global vertebrate populations. We investigated wildlife composition, occupancy, and activity pattern along the larger climate resilient forests that serve as microrefugia for a wide range of species under the escalating climate change. We used camera trap survey covering 250 km2 of climate microrefugia in dadeldhura hills in far western region of nepal. We used 62 trapping locations accumulating 1800 trap nights taking 98,916 photographs in 62 days-survey period during the summer season of 2020. We photographed 23 mammalian species with estimated species richness of 30 species (95% ci: 25â34) based on multi-species occupancy model. We estimated overall species occupancy î¨(se(î¨)) to be 0.87 (0.09) in climatic microrefugia. While human activity predominated throughout the day, the majority of animals was found to exhibit nocturnal temporal patterns. Tiger and hyaena, two of the top predators, were newly discovered in the western himalayan range of nepal, with their discovery at the 34 highest elevations of 2511 meters and 2000m, respectively. In nepal, high-altitude tiger range is characterized by tiger distribution above a 2000 m cutoff representing habitats in the physiographic zone of high mountains and above. Our findings establish a baseline and show that the climatic microrefugia that have been identified have high levels of species richness and occupancy, which characterize the dadeldhura hill forest ranges as biologically varied and ecologically significant habitat. These areas identified as climatic microrefugia habitats should be the focus of conservation efforts, particularly efforts to reduce human disturbance and adapt to climate change.

5,2022,"Effects of diversity on thermal niche variation in bird communities under climate change","Scientific Reports","Climate change alters ecological communities by affecting individual species and interactions between species. However, the impacts of climate change may be buffered by community diversity: diverse communities may be more resistant to climate-driven perturbations than simple communities. Here, we assess how diversity influences long-term thermal niche variation in communities under climate change. We use 50-year continental-scale data on bird communities during breeding and non-breeding seasons to quantify the communitiesâ thermal variability. Thermal variability is measured as the temporal change in the communityâs average thermal niche and it indicates communityâs response to climate change. Then, we study how the thermal variability varies as a function of taxonomic, functional, and evolutionary diversity using linear models. We find that communities with low thermal niche variation have higher functional diversity, with this pattern being measurable in the non-breeding but not in the breeding season. Given theâ expected increase in seasonal variation in the future climate, the differences in bird communitiesâ thermal variability between breeding and non-breeding seasons may grow wider. Importantly, our results suggest that functionally diverse wildlife communities can mitigate effects of climate change by hindering changes in thermal niche variability, which underscores the importance of addressing the climate and biodiversity crises together.

Environmental dna (edna) metabarcoding has been used as a powerful tool for identifying community composition, but it does not necessarily provide quantitative information due to several methodological limitations. Thus, the quantification of edna through metabarcoding is an important frontier of edna-based biomonitoring. Particularly, the qmiseq approach has recently been developed as a quantitative metabarcoding method and has attracted much attention due to its usefulness. The aim here was to evaluate the performance of the qmiseq approach as a quantitative monitoring tool for fish communities by comparing the quantified edna concentrations with the results of fish capture surveys. The edna water sampling and the capture surveys using the electrical shocker were conducted at a total of 21 sites in four rivers in japan. As a result, we found significant positive relationships between theâ edna concentrations of each species quantified by qmiseq and both the abundance and biomass of each captured taxon at each site. Furthermore, for seven out of eleven taxa, a significant positive relationship was observed between quantified dna concentrations by sample and the abundance and/or biomass. In total, our results demonstrated that edna metabarcoding with the qmiseq approach is a suitable and useful tool for quantitative monitoring of fish communities. Due to the simplicity of the edna analysis, the edna metabarcoding with qmiseq approach would promote further growth of quantitative monitoring of biodiversity.

The assessment of ecosystems under the influence of livestock production is essential for knowing their integrity and ability to provide ecosystem services. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the application of leap/fao guidelines for quantitative assessment of biodiversity in the livestock sector at the local scale (farm level) in a group of six study cases in uruguay. A set of 20 indicators was used, including seven key thematic issues: habitat protection, habitat change, wildlife conservation, invasive species, pollution, aquatic biodiversity, off-farm feed, and landscape-scale conservation. The results show that the leap biodiversity assessment guidelines can be useful to characterize the state of ecosystems under pastoral use and some specific components of their biodiversity, as well as assess the interaction of the production system with the environment and plan management accordingly. This work also provides an analysis of the methodology used and recommendations to facilitate its application by the sector. The results from the application of the indicators show a great deal of wild biodiversity that uses grazing systems based on native grasslands as habitats and the acceptable integrity of these ecosystems. On average, farms have 83% of their native ecosystem, with a value of 3.5 for the ecosystem integrity index. In terms of the richness of different groups, there was an average number of species of 112 herbaceous plants, 48 woody plants, 48 spiders, 150 birds, and 14 fish. The main goal of this work is to help in the wider application of the guidelines by facilitating decisions about methodology, necessary resources, and technical support. Moreover, another goal is to show the importance of native grasslands-based livestock systems for biodiversity conservation.

We used this combination of long-term temporal and large-scale spatial sampling to evaluate 3 hypotheses relating to genetic recovery that (i) gene flow between subpopulations would increase over time, (ii) genetic diversity of previously isolated populations would increase and that (iii) genetic structuring would weaken over time. Although we found an increase in inter-regional gene flow and admixture levels among subpopulations, there was no significant temporal change in either heterozygosity or allelic richness. Genetic structuring among the main subpopulations hence remained strong and showed a clear historical continuity. These findings highlight an underappreciated aspect of population recovery of endangered species: that genetic recovery may often lag behind the processes of spatial and demographic recovery. In other words, the restoration of the physical connectivity of populations does not necessarily lead to genetic connectivity. Our findings emphasize the need for genetic data as an integral part of conservation monitoring, to enable the potential vulnerability of populations to be evaluated. Â© 2022 the authors.

9,2022,"Predictors of support for biodiversity loss countermeasure and bushmeat consumption among vietnamese urban residents","Conservation Science And Practice","Biodiversity loss is happening at an unprecedented rate, especially in countries like vietnam, with rich biodiversity and a high population growth rate. One of the main causes of biodiversity loss in vietnam is the unsustainable bushmeat consumption rate in urban areas. To help mitigate the demand for bushmeat, this study aims to examine the associations between biodiversity loss perceptions, perception toward the prohibition of illegal wildlife consumption, and bushmeat consumption behaviors among urban residents in vietnam. The investigation employed the bayesian mindsponge framework (bmf)âan analytical framework that combines the strengths of the mindsponge mechanism and bayesian inference to facilitate investigation into psychological and behavioral issuesâon 535 respondents from urban areas across vietnam (mostly in the two urban centers of ho chi minh and hanoi). We found that people perceiving environmental degradation, and losses of economic growth, nature-based recreation opportunities, health, and knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss were more likely to support the prohibition of illegal wildlife consumption. Although urban residents tended to consume bushmeat less frequently if they perceived losses of economic growth and knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss, the perception of environmental degradation had an opposite effect on the behavior. Additionally, people consuming bushmeat frequently and supporting the biodiversity loss preventive measure seemed to share similar features: high income and educational levels. These paradoxical results hint at the cultural additivity phenomenonâthe willingness to incorporate into one's mind the new values that might or might not logically contradict their existing core cultural valuesâand its influence on psychology and behavior among vietnamese urban residents. Given the influence of cultural additivity, it is recommended to put tougher measures (e.g., financial punishment) into perspective so that urban people can recognize the high âcostâ of bushmeat consumption and change their perceptions and behaviors accordingly. Apart from that, social marketing, demarketing, or educational campaigns should convey knowledge and information that can help receivers relate biodiversity loss and bushmeat consumption to their subjective cost-benefit judgments rather than the rarity of the species to avoid triggering an anthropogenic allee effectâfor example, emphasizing the penalty for consuming bushmeat and negative impacts of biodiversity loss on humans in targeted campaigns (e.g., losses of economic growth and knowledge).

10,2022,"Using population monitoring programs to detect changes in mammalian communities","Biological Conservation","The global biodiversity crisis is escalating rapidly, with nearly a million species facing extinction risk in the near future. Monitoring of essential biodiversity variables (ebv; key variables measured to detect changes in biodiversity) over time is important for biodiversity conservation, which in turn necessitates baseline estimates of ebvs. Using camera-trap data for six years (2013â2018) and a bayesian multispecies occupancy model, we estimated species richness and species-specific occupancy of a mammalian community in pakke tiger reserve, india. We detected 28 species of mammals in our camera traps. The model-based estimate of species richness during the study period was 41 (95 % cri: 39â42) species, with no evidence of any substantial temporal variation. We found that carnivore and herbivore species richness was higher in greener habitats and that omnivore species richness was higher at lower-elevation sites. Annual average species occupancy probability (at the scale of 4-km2 sampling units) did not vary substantially between years but was lowest in 2014 (0.54, 95 % cri: 0.20â0.84) and highest in 2013 (0.59, 95 % cri: 0.27â0.87). Mean species-specific occupancy averaged across the years varied substantially among species, ranging from a low of 0.03 (95 % cri: 0.00â0.08) for the masked palm civet paguma larvata to a high of 0.94 (95 % cri: 0.87â0.98) for the asian elephant elephas maximus. Mean occupancy probability was highest for herbivores followed by omnivores and carnivores. Species-specific detection probability (for a 30â60-day survey period) was not influenced by survey effort but increased with body mass for carnivores and decreased with body mass for herbivores and omnivores. We propose a framework for efficient monitoring of species and community-level ebv, utilizing data collected during the monitoring of high-profile species of conservation concern, such as tigers panthera tigris in india.

11,2022,"Fence management and time since pack formation influence african wild dog escapes from protected areas in south africa","Journal For Nature Conservation","In human-dominated and highly fragmented landscapes, keeping wildlife within reserve boundaries is vital for conservation success. In south africa, fences are a widely employed conservation management tool for protected areas and are successful in mitigating human-wildlife conflict. However, fences are permeable, and predators are able to cross through reserve fences. African wild dogs (lycaon pictus) often leave fenced boundaries, resulting in high capture and translocation costs. Moreover, when wild dog packs (up to 30 individuals) leave fenced reserves they enter human-dominated landscapes where they face strong persecution and livestock predation incurs high costs. The factors driving packs to leave managed reserves are poorly understood, thus, to effectively manage wild dogs in fenced systems, it is important to understand why they leave reserve boundaries. There are several hypotheses as to why wild dogs cross through reserve fences, including inter- and intra-specific competition, social behaviour, management, prey density and environmental variability. Using a long-term dataset comprising 32 resident packs across five reserves, we investigated the relative strength of these hypotheses on the probability of wild dogs exiting a fenced reserve. During the 14-year study period, we recorded 154 exit events. We found that the interaction of fence integrity and time since pack formation were the primary factors affecting the probability of a pack leaving a reserve. When fence integrity was poor, escape probability decreased with pack age likely due to the exploratory behaviour of new packs. When fence integrity was average, escape probability increased with pack age likely due to the fitness benefits of holding larger and more exclusive territories as packs age. When fence integrity was good, the probability of a pack escaping was very low (only 1% occurrence). The implications of this research suggest that the primary management consideration for reducing wild dog escapes from fenced reserves should be maintaining adequate reserve-wide fence integrity, rather than focusing on social structure or drivers of inter- and intra-specific competition.

12,2022,"Body mass and latitude as global predictors of vertebrate populations exposure to multiple threats","Ecography","The interactive effects of multiple threats are one of the main causes of biodiversity loss, yet our understanding of what predisposes species to be impacted by multiple threats remains limited. Here we analyse a global dataset of over 7000 marine, freshwater and terrestrial vertebrate populations, alongside trait, threat and geographical data, to identify the factors influencing the number of threats a species is subjected to at the population level. Out of a suite of predictors tested, we find that body mass and latitude both are broadly available for vertebrate species and influence the number of threats a population is subjected to. Larger-bodied species and those nearer the equator are typically affected by a higher number of threats. However, whilst this pattern broadly holds across ecosystems for most taxa, amphibians and reptiles show opposing trends. We suggest that latitude and body mass should be considered as key predictors to identify which vertebrate populations are likely to be impacted by multiple threats. These general predictors can help to better understand the impacts of the anthropocene on global vertebrate biodiversity and design effective conservation policies. Â© 2022 the authors.

13,2022,"Biological invasions as a selective filter driving behavioral divergence","Nature Communications","Biological invasions are a multi-stage process (i.e., transport, introduction, establishment, spread), with each stage potentially acting as a selective filter on traits associated with invasion success. Behavior (e.g., exploration, activity, boldness) plays a key role in facilitating species introductions, but whether invasion acts as a selective filter on such traits is not well known. Here we capitalize on the well-characterized introduction of an invasive lizard (lampropholis delicata) across three independent lineages throughout the pacific, and show that invasion shifted behavioral trait means and reduced among-individual variationâtwo key predictions of the selective filter hypothesis. Moreover, lizards from all three invasive ranges were also more behaviorally plastic (i.e., greater within-individual variation) than their native range counterparts. We provide support for the importance of selective filtering of behavioral traits in a widespread invasion. Given that invasive species are a leading driver of global biodiversity loss, understanding how invasion selects for specific behaviors is critical for improving predictions of the effects of alien species on invaded communities.

14,2022,"Impacts of pastures and forestry plantations on herpetofauna: a global meta-analysis","Journal Of Applied Ecology","The establishment of pastures and forestry plantations has increased globally to meet growing demands for meat and wood products. Pasture and plantation expansion often drives deforestation, which causes homogenization of biotic communities and is a major driver of the global extinction crisis. A core question is how the severity of losses varies between pastures and plantations, and in turn, how geographical location and plantation management characteristics moderate these impacts. Focusing on herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles) as the most endangered vertebrate group, we performed a global synthesis using 41 scientific articles that reported species richness or abundance in pastures and forestry plantations relative to natural forest in 191 case studies among 19 countries. We found a severe negative effect of pasture and a less negative effect of forestry plantations on species richness and abundance of herpetofauna. Within plantations, species richness and total abundance were more negatively impacted in amphibians than reptiles, in the tropics, when planting exotic tree species, monocultures, large or commercial plantations, and when clearing understory vegetation. Yet mixed, old, small or conservation plantations and those permitting recovery of understory vegetation had no negative impacts relative to the reference natural forest. Synthesis and applications. The loss of herpetofauna species richness and abundance underscores the importance of halting ongoing tropical deforestation for pasture and intensive forestry plantations. The potential for appropriately managed forestry plantations to support biodiversity in regions lacking forest cover, including via replacement of anthropogenic pastures, suggests that such plantations have an important role under global reforestation agendas.

15,2022,"Spatio-temporal changes in chimpanzee density and abundance in the greater mahale ecosystem, tanzania","Ecological Applications","Species conservation and management require reliable information about animal distribution and population size. Better management actions within a species' range can be achieved by identifying the location and timing of population changes. In the greater mahale ecosystem (gme), western tanzania, deforestation due to the expansion of human settlements and agriculture, annual burning, and logging are known threats to wildlife. For one of the most charismatic species, the endangered eastern chimpanzee (pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), approximately 75% of the individuals are distributed outside national park boundaries, requiring monitoring and protection efforts over a vast landscape of various protection statuses. These efforts are especially challenging when we lack data on trends in density and population size. To predict spatio-temporal chimpanzee density and abundance across the gme, we used density surface modeling, fitting a generalized additive model to a 10-year time-series data set of nest counts based on line-transect surveys. The chimpanzee population declined at an annual rate of 2.41%, including declines of 1.72% in riparian forests (from this point forward, forests), 2.05% in miombo woodlands (from this point forward, woodlands) and 3.45% in nonforests. These population declines were accompanied by ecosystem-wide declines in vegetation types of 1.36% and 0.32% per year for forests and woodlands, respectively; we estimated an annual increase of 1.35% for nonforests. Our model predicted the highest chimpanzee density in forests (0.86 chimpanzees/km2, 95% confidence intervals (cis) 0.60â1.23; as of 2020), followed by woodlands (0.19, 95% ci 0.12â0.30) and nonforests (0.18, 95% ci 0.10â1.33). Although forests represent only 6% of the landscape, they support nearly one-quarter of the chimpanzee population (769 chimpanzees, 95% ci 536â1103). Woodlands dominate the landscape (71%) and therefore support more than a half of the chimpanzee population (2294; 95% ci 1420â3707). The remaining quarter of the landscape is represented by nonforests and supports another quarter of the chimpanzee population (750; 95% ci 408â1381). Given the pressures on the remaining suitable habitat in tanzania, and the need of chimpanzees to access both forest and woodland vegetation to survive, we urge future management actions to increase resources and expand the efforts to protect critical forest and woodland habitat and promote strategies and policies that more effectively prevent irreversible losses. We suggest that regular monitoring programs implement a systematic random design to effectively inform and allocate conservation actions and facilitate interannual comparisons for trend monitoring, measuring conservation success, and guiding adaptive management.

16,2022,"Tree mixtures mediate negative effects of introduced tree species on bird taxonomic and functional diversity","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Recent biodiversity loss has emphasized the necessity to critically evaluate the consequences of human alterations of forest ecosystems. Stand diversification via tree species mixtures and the use of non-native trees are two such alterations currently gaining importance as climate change adaptations. However, the effects of local versus regional tree mixing on associated biodiversity and notably the modifying role of tree species growing outside their natural range remain poorly understood. We assessed how monocultures and mixtures of native and introduced tree species influence the taxonomic and functional diversity of bird communities at stand and landscape scales in north-west germany. We focused on the dominant natural tree species (fagus sylvatica) and economically important conifer species planted outside their natural range (the native picea abies and non-native pseudotsuga menziesii). We found that bird species richness and functional diversity were generally higher in pure and mixed stands of native f. Sylvatica than in pure conifer stands, especially in comparison to non-native p. Menziesii. These differences were particularly strong at the landscape scale. Pure conifer stands harboured only a reduced set of functionally similar bird species. Structural diversity based on tree microhabitat availability emerged as a key predictor of bird diversity. Synthesis and applications. Our study suggests that tree species mixtures do not necessarily increase bird diversity compared to pure stands of native trees, but can promote bird diversity relative to pure stands of species planted outside their natural range. Moreover, local mixtures, rather than a mosaic of pure stands, may promote bird diversity also at the landscape scale. By contrast, pure stands of tree species planted outside their natural range can increase biotic homogenization of forest birds. Promoting structural diversity of microhabitats via tree retention and ensuring that non-native trees are planted in mixtures with native trees may alleviate potential limitations of climate change-oriented management for biodiversity.

17,2022,"Can secondary forests mitigate the negative effect of old-growth forest loss on biodiversity? A landscape-scale assessment of two endangered primates","Landscape Ecology","Context: old-growth forest loss drives the global biodiversity crisis. Nevertheless, this impact could be buffered by the increasing expansion of secondary (regenerating) forests, which can provide supplementary habitat for wildlife. Objectives: we tested this hypothesis assessing the effect of old-growth and secondary forest cover on the abundance and immature-to-female ratio (proxy of reproductive success) of two endangered primates: geoffroyâ spider monkeys and black howler monkeys. Methods: we measured the response and predictor variables across 18 whole landscapes (landscape-scale approach) in the lacandona rainforest, mexico. As there could be tipping points of forest loss beyond which species extinction is accelerated (extinction thresholds), we separately tested the linear and non-linear effect of forest cover on each response, independently for three spatial scales. Results: we found stronger and larger-scale negative responses to forest loss in spider monkeys than in howler monkeys. However, the data were better predicted by linear models, giving no support to the extinction threshold hypothesis. In both species, forest loss had stronger negative impacts on monkey abundance when considering old-growth forest, than when considering secondary forest cover, or total (old-growth + secondary) forest cover. Yet, the immature-to-female ratio was weakly related to forest cover in both species. Conclusion: secondary forests seem to have a weak buffering effect in both species, possibly because they are relatively young (< 30 years old) and do not have large trees. This implies that old-growth forests are irreplaceable for preventing primate extirpation, especially for species with specialized diet and large spatial requirements, such as spider monkeys.

18,2022,"Predicting current and future species distribution of the raccoon dog (nyctereutes procyonoides) in shanghai, china","Landscape And Urban Planning","Rapid urbanization has caused drastic changes in urban ecosystems, resulting in various urgent management needs from mitigating biodiversity loss to preventing human-wildlife conflicts. Using species distribution modeling to understand urban speciesâ distributional patterns and predict their future changes is thus important to support decision-making. Raccoon dog (nyctereutes procyonoides) that previously inhabited shanghai had been extirpated from the metropolitan area but recently returned to and expanded in almost all districts, causing hundreds of human-raccoon dog conflicts. In this study, we initiated a citizen science project, identified factors associated with raccoon dog habitat selection, and predicted its current suitable habitat as well as potential future ranges under different city development scenarios. By constructing an ensemble modeling using data from camera trap surveys, interviews and rescuing records, we found that raccoon dog distribution was positively associated with several anthropogenic factors including nighttime light, human population, and percentage area of buildings. We predicted a 156,024 ha suitable habitat for raccoon dogs throughout shanghai, among which only 5,811 ha (3.72 %) was currently occupied. Our results indicated considerable potential of raccoon dogsâ future expansion, which had been consistently ignored in previous management plans. To alleviate the increasing human-raccoon dog conflicts, we found strategies to slow down raccoon dog movement effective tools, and suggest adaptive management to provide fast response and flexible solutions. This is the first study to investigate human-wildlife conflict in china's urban environment, and our approach has substantial implications for shanghai as well as other regions where urban species are undergoing rapid expansion.

19,2022,"Potential distribution and connectivity for two plethodontid salamanders: conservation areas and landscape corridors for two endemic species of mãxico and guatemala","Environmental Management","Habitat loss is one of the most important threats to biodiversity; it alters the habitat connectivity of species and is among the main causes of the global amphibian extinction crisis. Identifying the potential areas of distribution and connectivity of species is of the utmost importance so that informed decisions can be made for the conservation of vulnerable amphibian populations. In this study, we performed species distribution models and used circuit theory to model omnidirectional connectivity for two plethodontid salamanders of conservation concern distributed in the forests of chiapas, mexico, and guatemala (bolitoglossa franklini and bolitoglossa lincolni). Potential distribution maps show an affinity for well-preserved montane forests for both species. Likewise, we found that the niches of the species are not similar. The connectivity models show that the main areas of connectivity are in the meseta central de chiapas, sierra madre de chiapas, and the cordillera volcãnica guatemalense, in this last range, important areas of connectivity were located, as well as least-cost paths and barriers to the movement of both species. We identified that important areas of climatic suitability and connectivity are not within the protected natural areas and may be threatened by the increasing influence of anthropogenic activities. The results of our study show the importance of preserving the regional forests to ensure the persistence of species with arboreal habits and high sensitivity to habitat transformation, as well as to recognize and prioritize potential areas for management and protection in both southern mexico and guatemala.

20,2022,"Quantifying the conservation status and abundance trends of wildlife communities with detectionânondetection data","Conservation Biology","Effective conservation requires understanding speciesâ abundance patterns and demographic rates across space and time. Ideally, such knowledge should be available for whole communities because variation in speciesâ dynamics can elucidate factors leading to biodiversity losses. However, collecting data to simultaneously estimate abundance and demographic rates of communities of species is often prohibitively time intensive and expensive. We developed a multispecies dynamic n-occupancy model to estimate unbiased, community-wide relative abundance and demographic rates. In this model, detectionânondetection data (e.g., repeated presenceâabsence surveys) are used to estimate species- and community-level parameters and the effects of environmental factors. To validate our model, we conducted a simulation study to determine how and when such an approach can be valuable and found that our multispecies model outperformed comparable single-species models in estimating abundance and demographic rates in many cases. Using data from a network of camera traps across tropical equatorial africa, we then used our model to evaluate the statuses and trends of a forest-dwelling antelope community. We estimated relative abundance, rates of recruitment (i.e., reproduction and immigration), and apparent survival probabilities for each speciesâ local population. The antelope community was fairly stable (although 17% of populations [speciesâpark combinations] declined over the study period). Variation in apparent survival was linked more closely to differences among national parks than to individual speciesâ life histories. The multispecies dynamic n-occupancy model requires only detectionânondetection data to evaluate the population dynamics of multiple sympatric species and can thus be a valuable tool for examining the reasons behind recent biodiversity loss.

21,2022,"Combining surface and soil environmental dna with artificial cover objects to improve terrestrial reptile survey detection","Conservation Biology","Reptiles are increasingly of conservation concern due to their susceptibility to habitat loss, emerging disease, and harvest in the wildlife trade. However, reptile populations are often difficult to monitor given the frequency of crypsis in their life history. This difficulty has left uncertain the conservation status of many species and the efficacy of conservation actions unknown. Environmental dna (edna) surveys consistently elevate the detection rate of species they are designed to monitor, and while their use is promising for terrestrial reptile conservation, successes in developing such surveys have been sparse. We tested the degree to which inclusion of surface and soil edna sampling into conventional artificial-cover methods elevates the detection probability of a small, cryptic terrestrial lizard, scincella lateralis. The edna sampling of cover object surfaces with paint rollers elevated per sample detection probabilities for this species 4â16 times compared with visual surveys alone. We readily detected s. Lateralis edna under cover objects up to 2 weeks after the last visual detection, and at some cover objects where no s. Lateralis were visually observed in prior months. With sufficient sampling intensity, edna testing of soil under cover objects produced comparable per sample detection probabilities as roller surface methods. Our results suggest that combining edna and cover object methods can considerably increase the detection power of reptile monitoring programs, allowing more accurate estimates of population size, detection of temporal and spatial changes in habitat use, and tracking success of restoration efforts. Further research into the deposition and decay rates of reptile edna under cover objects, as well as tailored protocols for different species and habitats, is needed to bring the technique into widespread use.

Populations locally adapted to spatially heterogeneous environments may respond differentially to climate change, but this intraspecific variation has only recently been considered when modelling vulnerability under climate change. Here, we incorporate intraspecific variation in genomic offset and ecological niche modelling to estimate climate change-driven vulnerability in two bird species in the sino-himalayan mountains. We found that the cold-tolerant populations show higher genomic offset but risk less challenge for niche suitability decline under future climate than the warm-tolerant populations. Based on a genome-niche index estimated by combining genomic offset and niche suitability change, we identified the populations with the least genome-niche interruption as potential donors for evolutionary rescue, i.e., the populations tolerant to climate change. We evaluated potential rescue routes via a landscape genetic analysis. Overall, we demonstrate that the integration of genomic offset, niche suitability modelling, and landscape connectivity can improve climate change-driven vulnerability assessments and facilitate effective conservation management.

Invasive species are the primary driver of native biodiversity loss on islands, though eradication of invasive species from islands has been effective at halting or reversing these trends. A global compendium of this conservation tool is essential for scaling best-practices and enabling innovations to maximize biodiversity outcomes. Here, we synthesize over 100â years of invasive vertebrate eradications from islands, comprising 1550 eradication attempts on 998 islands, with an 88% success rate. We show a significant growth in eradication activity since the 1980s, primarily driven by rodent eradications. The annual number of eradications on islands peaked in the mid-2000s, but the annual area treated continues to rise dramatically. This trend reflects increases in removal efficacy and project complexity, generating increased conservation gains. Our synthesis demonstrates the collective contribution of national interventions towards global biodiversity outcomes. Further investment in invasive vertebrate eradications from islands will expand biodiversity conservation while strengthening biodiversity resilience to climate change and creating co-benefits for human societies.

24,2022,"Win-win opportunities combining high yields with high multi-taxa biodiversity in tropical agroforestry","Nature Communications","Resolving ecological-economic trade-offs between biodiversity and yields is a key challenge when addressing the biodiversity crisis in tropical agricultural landscapes. Here, we focused on the relation between seven different taxa (trees, herbaceous plants, birds, amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and ants) and yields in vanilla agroforests in madagascar. Agroforests established in forests supported overall 23% fewer species and 47% fewer endemic species than old-growth forests, and 14% fewer endemic species than forest fragments. In contrast, agroforests established on fallows had overall 12% more species and 38% more endemic species than fallows. While yields increased with vanilla vine density and length, non-yield related variables largely determined biodiversity. Nonetheless, trade-offs existed between yields and butterflies as well as reptiles. Vanilla yields were generallyâ unrelated to richness of trees, herbaceous plants, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and ants, opening up possibilities for conservation outside of protected areas and restoring degraded land to benefit farmers and biodiversity alike.

25,2022,"Climate change is expected to restructure forest frugivorous bird communities in a biodiversity hot-point within the atlantic forest","Diversity And Distributions","Aim: changes in climatic conditions are predicted to impact species distribution and hence alter their diversity patterns. Modifications in the composition of biological communities are expected as a result of the loss and replacement of species due to global warming. Forest frugivorous birds already suffer from habitat loss and may disappear locally due to suitable area contraction or range shifts to novel areas, disrupting seed dispersal and consequently the functioning of natural ecosystems. Here, we investigate the impacts of different climate scenarios on alpha and beta diversities of forest frugivorous birds. Location: central corridor of the atlantic forest (ccaf), brazil. Methods: we used ecological niche models to project species distribution of 68 frugivorous birds for the baseline and future (2050 and 2070) scenarios. We generated binary maps of suitable areas for each species by climate scenario to calculate alpha and beta diversities. Results: most forest frugivorous birds were projected to lose suitable area, as a consequence of climate change, reducing alpha diversity in future scenarios and increasing temporal beta diversity, which is dominated by the nestedness component. In addition, species richness decreased from the east to the west portion of the ccaf, while differentiation of bird communities increased in the same direction, a pattern consistent across all climate scenarios evaluated. Main conclusions: climate change may exert drastic alterations in the composition of frugivorous bird communities in the ccaf. As forest frugivorous birds are critical to seed dispersal of forest plant species, impoverishment of their communities can drastically affect forest regeneration, diversity, and structure in the decades to come. Therefore, a better comprehension of spatio-temporal changes in diversity patterns of frugivorous birds can help us to avoid the disruption of seed dispersal and its consequences, such as cascading effects that will trigger biodiversity loss in the ccaf.

26,2022,"Using pva and captive breeding to balance trade-offs in the rescue of the island dibbler onto a new island ark","Scientific Reports","In the face of the current global extinction crisis, it is critical we give conservation management strategies the best chance of success. Australia is not exempt from global trends with currently the worldâs greatest mammal extinction rate (~ 1 per 8â years). Many more are threatened including the dibbler (parantechinus apicalis) whose remnant range has been restricted to western australia at just one mainland site and two small offshore islandsâwhitlock island (5â ha) and boullanger island (35â ha). Here, we used 14 microsatellite markers to quantify genetic variation in the remaining island populations from 2013 to 2018 and incorporated these data into population viability analysis (pva) models, used to assess factors important to dibbler survival and to provide guidance for translocations. Remnant population genetic diversity was low (< 0.3), and populations were highly divergent from each other (pairwise fsts 0.29â0.52). Comparison of empirical data to an earlier study is consistent with recent declines in genetic diversity and models projected increasing extinction risk and declining genetic variation in the next century. Optimal translocation scenarios recommend 80 founders for new dibbler populationsâprovided by captive breedingâand determined the proportion of founders from parental populations to maximise genetic diversity and minimise harvesting impact. The goal of our approach is long-term survival of genetically diverse, self-sustaining populations and our methods are transferable. We consider mixing island with mainland dibblers to reinforce genetic variation.

27,2022,"Faunal communities mediate the effects of plant richness, drought, and invasion on ecosystem multifunctional stability","Communications Biology","Understanding the stability of ecosystem multifunctionality is imperative for maintaining ecosystem health and sustainability under augmented global change. However it remains unknown whether and how biological communities mediate multifunctional stability in response to biodiversity loss and disturbances. Here, we conducted a 3-year experiment by exposing 270 plant communities of four plant richness levels, i.e., 1, 2, 4, or 8 species, to drought and exotic plant invasion disturbances. Then, the direct effects of plant richness, drought and invasion, and their indirect effects mediated by the stability of plant, litter-faunal, and soil-faunal communities on multifunctional stability were disentangled. We found that plant richness increased, while drought and invasion decreased ecosystem multifunctional stability, which were mediated by plant or faunal community stability. By incorporating the stability of communities into the complex ecological mechanisms, the completeness and goodness of ecological models for explaining and maintaining the stability of ecosystem multifunctionality will be improved.

28,2022,"What evidence exists on the impact of climate change on some of the worst invasive fish and shellfish? A systematic map protocol","Environmental Evidence","Background: the intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services (ipbes) has estimated that invasive alien species (ias) might cause billions of dollars of losses every year across the world. One example is south-east asia, where ias have caused an estimated loss of 33.5â billion usd, affecting the environment, human health, and agricultural production. Factors associated with climate change, such as increased carbon dioxide (co2), heavy precipitation, and elevated temperatures is expected to facilitate biological invasion, leading only to further financial and public health loss. Thus, further study is needed to identify, collate and categorise what evidence exists on the impacts of climate change on fish and shellfish species that contribute to the list of âone hundred of the worldâs worst invasive alien speciesâ as identified by the international union for conservation of natureâs (iucn). Such mapping will identify regions more at risk of biological invasion as climate change progresses. Methods: we outline a systematic mapping review protocol that follows the guideline and standards for evidence synthesis in environmental management and reporting standards for systematic evidence syntheses (roses). We describe how peer-reviewed articles will be collected from web of science and scopus, and then analyzed to create knowledge maps on the impact climate change has on invasive species. Finally, we speculate on how our results will aid future management of invasive species in the light of climate change.

29,2022,"Response of farmland reptiles to agricultural intensification: collapse of the common adder vipera berus and the western green lizard lacerta bilineata in a hedgerow landscape","Animal Conservation","Agricultural landscapes cover a large portion of the planet and the intensification of farming is a primary cause of biodiversity loss. Changes in agricultural practices have been particularly marked in western europe over the last century. Hedgerow landscapes consist of complex mosaics of pastures, ponds, and hedges connected with forest patches that are favourable for biodiversity. Recently, however, these traditional farming landscapes have been profoundly simplified with a massive reduction in hedgerows. Reptiles are currently facing an important global decline, but the impact of the intensification of agricultural practices on their populations remains understudied. We studied the common european adder vipera berus and the western green lizard lacerta bilineata in western france in a hedgerow landscape undergoing agricultural intensification. We first quantified the habitat changes (density of hedgerows and forest edges) from 1950 to 2015. Second, we documented changes in the distribution of v. Berus and l. Bilineata in the area between two surveys conducted 18 years apart (survey 1: 1994â1997 and survey 2: 2012â2015). The two species were more likely to be found at sites with dense hedgerows and forest edges at the first survey. We detected marked range contractions in the distributions of both species over 18 years (92% and 74%, respectively, for v. Berus and l. Bilineata). Population monitoring of the adder with capture-mark-recapture at two sites revealed marked declines related to the degradation of hedgerows and closure of the forest patches. Our results underline the importance of traditional agricultural landscapes for biodiversity conservation and the value of squamate reptiles as indicator speciesed in such landscapes.

30,2022,"Failure is the greatest teacher: embracing the positives of failure in primate conservation","International Journal Of Primatology","Âfailureâ is recognised as being vital for success in many fields but is seldom embraced in primate conservation or conservation more generally. In this paper, we use examples from the literature, particularly around reintroduction, to reflect on failure and consider the contribution it can make to primate conservation success. Barriers to acknowledging failure are highlighted and include concerns regarding reputational damage that impact on communication with funders, publishing, and discussing our projects more widely. We also discuss the need for a broader and adaptive approach to include multiple steps of experimentation, reflection, and subsequent learning. This process, which necessarily includes failures and the results of unintended consequences, will require primatologists to use a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and reflective approach to effectively address factors that contribute to failure, including those external to the traditional focus of primatologists. The paper concludes with specific recommendations for progressing in this area, including (i) fundingâfunders to incorporate greater flexibility in response to project change and to specifically ask grantees to consider risk, failure, and lessons learnt, and funders and grantees to improve dialogue; (ii) publishingâjournals to have a section that considers failure and lessons learnt and, along with societies, to further engage with researchers from the global south about the best ways to support with publishing; and (iii) communicationâprimate conservationists to lead by example and reflect/discuss failure openly and to create spaces that encourage sharing of these topics. Whilst not exhaustive, we hope that these recommendations will contribute to developing a culture of constructive discussion around failure in primate conservation.

31,2022,"The architecture of assisted colonisation in sea turtles: building new populations in a biodiversity crisis","Nature Communications","Due to changing environmental conditions, many species will have to migrate or occupy new suitable areas to avoid potential extinction in the current biodiversity crisis. Long-lived animals are especially vulnerable and ex-situ conservation actions can provide solutions through assisted colonisations. However, there is little empirical evidence on the process of founding new populations for such species or the feasibility of assisted colonisations as a viable conservation measure. Here, we combined genetics with reproductive data to study the rise of two wild populations of green turtles (chelonia mydas) in the cayman islands as a possible outcome of a reintroduction program started 50 years ago. We show that both populations are highly related to the captive population but rapidly diverged due to genetic drift. Individuals from the reintroduced populations showed high levels of nest fidelity, within and across nesting seasons, indicating that philopatry may help reinforce the success of new populations. Additionally, we show that reintroduction from captive populations has not undermined the reproductive fitness of first generation individuals. Sea turtle reintroduction programs can, therefore, establish new populations but require scientific evaluation of costs and benefits and should be monitored over time to ensure viability in the long-term.

32,2022,"Forest regeneration may reduce the negative impacts of climate change on the biodiversity of a tropical hotspot","Diversity And Distributions","Aim: evaluate how large-scale forest regeneration based on a low-cost restoration method may mitigate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation associated to future climate changes on the distribution of birds and arboreal mammals in a tropical biodiversity hotspot; find areas with different current and future potential species richness and assess how passive restoration can reduce the risk of species extinction. Location: brazilian atlantic forest (baf). Methods: we built a forest regeneration scenario via a model of seed dispersal based on the potential movement of frugivorous fauna and projected the potential distribution of 356 bird species and 21 arboreal mammals based on species distribution models (sdm) which employed 79,462 occurrence records and four algorithms for different climate and landscape scenarios. Sdm were based on climate and landscape predictors separately and the results were combined into maps of species richness. Finally, we assessed the speciesâ risk of extinction based on the speciesâarea relationship. Results: without considering the effects of climate change, the potential distribution area for each species increases on average by 72.5% (sd = 8%) in the scenario of potential regeneration. Climate change decreases the area of potential occurrence of 252â species, which may suffer a mean reduction of 74.4% (sd = 9.3%) in their current potential distribution areas. Baf regions with the largest amounts of forest had the greatest potential richness of species. In future climate scenario, 3.4% of species may become extinct, but we show that large-scale regeneration may prevent these extinctions. Main conclusions: despite the possible negative impacts of climate change on the distribution of 67% of the studied species, which would increase the risk of species extinction, our analysis indicated that promoting large-scale baf restoration based on natural regeneration may prevent biodiversity loss.

33,2022,"Cumulative effects of human footprint, natural features and predation risk best predict seasonal resource selection by white-tailed deer","Scientific Reports","Land modified for human use alters matrix shape and composition and is a leading contributor to global biodiversity loss. It can also play a key role in facilitating range expansion and ecosystem invasion by anthrophilic species, as it can alter food abundance and distribution while also influencing predation risk; the relative roles of these processes are key to habitat selection theory. We researched these relative influences by examining human footprint, natural habitat, and predator occurrence on seasonal habitat selection by range-expanding boreal white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) in the oil sands of western canada. We hypothesized that polygonal industrial features (e.g. Cutblocks, well sites) drive deer distributions as sources of early seral forage, while linear features (e.g. Roads, trails, and seismic lines) and habitat associated with predators are avoided by deer. We developed seasonal 2nd -order resource selection models from three years of deer gps-telemetry data, a camera-trap-based model of predator occurrence, and landscape spatial data to weigh evidence for six competing hypotheses. Deer habitat selection was best explained by the combination of polygonal and linear features, intact deciduous forest, and wolf (canis lupus) occurrence. Deer strongly selected for linear features such as roads and trails, despite a potential increased risk of wolf encounters. Linear features may attract deer by providing high density forage opportunity in heavily exploited landscapes, facilitating expansion into the boreal north.

34,2022,"Impacts on biodiversity from codend and fisher selection in bottom trawl fishing","Frontiers In Marine Science","Fisheries have important impacts on marine biodiversity. In this work, combined information on the abundance, species richness, diversity indices, species composition, trophic level and vulnerability index were examined for the first-time to detect differences in five units related to trawl fishing: the fish assemblage entering the trawl codend, and the escaping, retained, discarded and landed fractions, derived by the gear and fisher selection practices. The work was based on a case study conducted in the mediterranean sea, using three different meshes in the trawl codend (40mm-40d and 50mm-50d diamond meshes, and 40 mm-40s square meshes) and a cover of the codends with small mesh size. In general, trawl fishing produces an escaping fraction that was always lower in abundance, richness, and vulnerability index, similar in diversity indices and trophic level, and different in species composition compared to the fish assemblage entering the codend. In almost all cases, fishers selected as landings a fraction that was the lowest in diversity indices, and the highest in trophic level. In contrast, fishers discarded a fraction that was the highest in diversity and vulnerability index, and the lowest in trophic level. Although the three codends did not differ significantly in the fraction of escapees in terms of diversity indices, trophic level, and vulnerability index, the 40s codend showed a significantly higher percentage in the escaping number of species and individuals, and less differences in the species composition; in addition, lower percentage in abundance of discards and higher of landings in the retained catch (0.6:1) than did the other two codends (0.9:1). It was suggested that an urgent modification of the trawl for the elimination of the discarded highly vulnerable species (e.g. Elasmobranchs) is needed, and that trawl species-selectivity should be improved by allowing escape or avoiding catch of the discarded fraction to minimize biodiversity losses.

Unlike insects, genetic biocontrol strategies including population-suppressing gene drives with biased inheritance have not been developed in mice. Here, we demonstrate a gene drive strategy (tcrispr) that leverages super-mendelian transmission of the t haplotype to spread inactivating mutations in a haplosufficient female fertility gene (prl). Using spatially explicit individual-based in silico modeling, we show that tcrispr can eradicate island populations under a range of realistic field-based parameter values. We also engineer transgenic tcrispr mice that, crucially, exhibit biased transmission of the modified t haplotype and prl mutations at levels our modeling predicts would be sufficient for eradication. This is an example of a feasible gene drive system for invasive alien rodent population control. Copyright â© 2022 the author(s).

After ~58 years of increasing risk of extinction, effective fisheries management has shifted the biodiversity loss curve for tunas and billfishes, whereas the curve continues to worsen for sharks, which are highly undermanaged. While populations of highly valuable commercial species are being rebuilt, the next management challenge is to halt and reverse the harm afflicted by these same fisheries to broad oceanic biodiversity.

37,2022,"How does invasion degree shape alpha and beta diversity of freshwater fish at a regional scale?","Ecology And Evolution","Freshwater ecosystems appear more vulnerable to biodiversity loss due to several anthropogenic disturbances and freshwater fish are particularly vulnerable to these impacts. We aimed to (1) identify the contribution of land use, spatial variables, and invasion degree in determining freshwater fish alpha (i.e., species richness) and beta (i.e., local contributions to beta diversity, lcbd) diversity, evaluating also the relationship between invasion degree and nestedness ((formula presented.) Nes) and turnover ((formula presented.) Sim) components of beta diversity. (2) investigate the relationship between alpha diversity and lcbd, under the hypothesis that alpha diversity and lcbd correlate negatively and (3) investigate the relationship between species contributions to beta diversity (scbd) and species occurrence, hypothesizing that non-native species show a lower contribution to beta diversity. The linear mixed models and the partition of r2 retained the invasion degree as the most important variables explaining alpha and beta diversity, having a positive relationship with both diversity components. Furthermore, land use related to human impacts had a positive influence on alpha diversity, whereas it showed a negative effect on lcbd. Regression model further showed that invasion degree related positively with (formula presented.) Sim, but negatively with (formula presented.) Nes, suggesting that non-native species were involved in the replacement of native species in the fish community. Alpha diversity and lcbd showed a weak positive correlation, meaning that sites with low species richness have higher lcbd. Scbd scaled positively with species occurrence highlighting that rarer species contribute less to scbd. Finally, native and exotic species contributed similarly to beta diversity. These results suggest that invasion degree plays a central role in shaping alpha and beta diversity in stream fish, more than land use features reflecting habitat alteration or other geospatial variables. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate separately the native and the non-native components of biotic communities to identify linkages between invasion dynamics and biodiversity loss.

38,2022,"Origin of introduced italian wall lizards, podarcis siculus (rafinesque-schmaltz, 1810) (squamata: lacertidae), in north america","Bioinvasions Records","Invasive species are one of the main causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. As introduced, populations may increase in abundance and expand geographical range, so does the potential for negative impacts on native communities. As such, it is necessary to understand the processes driving range expansion, before a species becomes established in new areas. Through an investigation into capacity for population growth and range expansion of introduced populations of a non-native lizard, we aimed to demonstrate how multi-scale factors influence spatial spread, population growth, and invasion potential in introduced species. The italian wall lizard (podarcis siculus) was introduced multiple times to the united states with extant populations in california, kansas, new jersey, and new york. Recently, a single specimen was discovered in british columbia, canada, and unstudied populations are on orcas island and missouri (usa). We used phylogenetic analysis of mtdna sequences (cytb gene) of individuals sampled from these introduced populations and across the native range to identify potential source populations. Our phylogenetic analysis result with documentation of the introductions revealed that the canadian individual is derived from the tuscany clade (together with samples from kansas and new york). The new jersey population is likely from the adriatic clade and the californian one from sicily. The orcas island and missouri populations still require study. Consequently, humans are key drivers of the distribution of alien reptiles in north america, but the distributions are determined by a complex interplay between human activities, geographic factors and species features. Genetic evidence is essential for reliable biogeographic assessment of invasive species, particularly in systems with a long history of human influence.

39,2022,"Aligning conservation and public health goals to tackle unsustainable trade of mammals","Conservation Science And Practice","Unsustainable wildlife trade is a major driver of biodiversity loss and an important public health threat. Yet, effective wildlife trade regulation is currently at odds with food security and economic incentives provided by this global, multibillion-dollar industry. Given such limitations, public health and conservation resources can be aligned to target species for which trade both increases risk of extinction and threatens public health. Here, we developed a simple conservation and health trade risk (cht) index (range: 2â50) using a case study of traded mammals based on species' extinction and zoonotic risks, weighed by the extent of their trade. We applied this index to 1161 international union for the conservation of nature-listed terrestrial mammals involved in the wildlife trade to identify 284 high-priority species that scored high in the cht index (cht â¥ 18). Species ranking high for conservation, public health, and trade risks include those belonging to the orders primates, cetartiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), rodentia (rodents), chiroptera (bats), and carnivora (carnivores). Of the high-priority species, 33% (nâ =â 95) are country-endemics and may be good candidates for trade regulations and enforcement at national scales. Our study provides a preliminary step in prioritizing species, taxonomic groups, and countries for focused wildlife trade regulation to meet both conservation and public health goals.

40,2022,"Differential response to climate change and human activities in three lineages of sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (rhinopithecus roxellana)","Diversity And Distributions","Aim: determining the mechanisms by which climate change and human activities affect patterns of ecological specialization in different genetic units of the same species is crucial for developing local or regionally-based conservation solutions. This study uses species distribution models and genetic analysis to (1) identify the evidence of intraspecific differences in the population size and distribution of the three extant lineages (sichuan/gansu (sg), qinling (ql) and shennongjia (snj)) of sichuan snub-nosed monkeys and (2) determine why some lineages have lower population numbers, a smaller geographical distribution, and are more threatened with extinction. Location: china. Methods: we used n-dimensional hypervolume modelling and genotype-environment association (gea) models to compare the climatic niches of three snub-nosed monkey lineages, sdms to reconstruct the historical, current and future distributions of each lineage and smc++ to calculate their effective population sizes. Results: we found evidence of: (1) climatic niche differentiation among the sg, ql and snj lineages of sichuan snub-nosed monkeys; (2) geographical isolation combined with a decrease in population size during the lgm resulted in ecological specialization among these three lineages; and (3) a decline in climatic suitability and anthropogenically driven land conversion, combined with small population size and a narrow distributional range, indicates that the snj lineage is at a greater risk of extinction than the sg and ql lineages. Main conclusions: we demonstrate that during the lgm a reduction in habitat suitability driven by climate change, in concert with decreasing population size, resulted in the geographical isolation of the three sichuan snub-nosed monkey subpopulations, leading to lineage differences in ecological specialization. Gea models and hypervolume models demonstrated that the three lineages occupy different ecological niches. Based on lineage-level models, the snj and ql lineages should be the immediate focus of conservation efforts due to their small effective population size and expected future reductions in available suitable habitats. The modelling approach used here is robust and can be applied effectively to examine the biogeography, recent evolutionary history and effective population size of other endangered animal taxa.

41,2022,"Where have all the lions gone? Establishing realistic baselines to assess decline and recovery of african lions","Diversity And Distributions","Aim: predict empirically the current and recent historical (c1970) landscape connectivity and population size of the african lion as a baseline against which to assess conservation of the species. Location: continental africa. Methods: we compiled historical records of lion distribution to generate a recent historical range for the species. Historical population size was predicted using a generalized additive model. Resistant kernel and factorial least-cost path analyses were used to predict recent historical landscape connectivity and compare this with contemporary connectivity at continental, regional and country scales. Results: we estimate a baseline population of ~92,054 (83,017â101,094 95% ci) lions in c1970, suggesting africa's lion population has declined by ~75%, over the last five decades. Although greatly reduced from historical extents (c1500ad), recent historical lion habitat was substantially connected. However, in comparison, contemporary population connectivity has declined dramatically, with many populations now isolated, as well as large declines within remaining population core areas. This decline was most marked in the west and central region, with a 90% decline in connected habitat compared with its c1970 extent. The eastern and southern regions have experienced lower, though significant, declines in connected habitat (44% and 55%, respectively). Contemporary populations are connected by three non-core habitat linkages and 15 potential corridors (spanning unconnected habitat) that may allow dispersal and gene flow. Declining connectivity mirrors recent studies showing loss of genetic diversity and increasing genetic isolation of lion populations. Main conclusions: we provide an empirically derived baseline for african lion population size, habitat extent and connectivity in c1970 and at present against which to evaluate contemporary conservation of the species, avoiding a shifting baseline syndrome where conservation success/failure is measured only against recent population size or range.

42,2022,"A national fish passage barrier inventory to support fish passage policy implementation and estimate river connectivity in new zealand","Ecological Informatics","Fragmentation of river systems is a key driver of freshwater biodiversity loss. Instream structure inventories are an essential component of delivering a strategic approach to restoring river connectivity. We used a range of data sources to collate the best available information on fish passage barriers and instream structures across the whole of new zealand. To support implementation of new national policy objectives to maintain and improve river connectivity, the structure inventory has been integrated with a new fish passage assessment mobile application that allows river managers and asset owners to ground-truth, update and add records to the database. The data are provided open access and are being used for environmental reporting and to support strategic prioritisation of barrier mitigation actions. We used these data to quantify river connectivity at regional and national scales and demonstrated that at least half of new zealand's river network is upstream of fish migration barriers. Limitations to our calculation of upstream river connectivity included the unknown influence of unrecorded structures, particularly on private land, missing information within recorded data, the large number of instream structures that have been identified but not yet assessed for their risk to fish passage, and spatial errors in the automated pairing of structures to a digital river network. A critical challenge for river managers is understanding the consequences of these uncertainties in the data for prioritisation and decision-making regarding barrier removal or mitigation.

43,2022,"Population genomics of a predatory mammal reveals patterns of decline and impacts of exposure to toxic toads","Molecular Ecology","Mammal declines across northern australia are one of the major biodiversity loss events occurring globally. There has been no regional assessment of the implications of these species declines for genomic diversity. To address this, we conducted a species-wide assessment of genomic diversity in the northern quoll (dasyurus hallucatus), an endangered marsupial carnivore. We used next generation sequencing methods to genotype 10,191 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in 352 individuals from across a 3220-km length of the continent, investigating patterns of population genomic structure and diversity, and identifying loci showing signals of putative selection. We found strong heterogeneity in the distribution of genomic diversity across the continent, characterized by (i) biogeographical barriers driving hierarchical population structure through long-term isolation, and (ii) severe reductions in diversity resulting from population declines, exacerbated by the spread of introduced toxic cane toads (rhinella marina). These results warn of a large ongoing loss of genomic diversity and associated adaptive capacity as mammals decline across northern australia. Encouragingly, populations of the northern quoll established on toad-free islands by translocations appear to have maintained most of the initial genomic diversity after 16 years. By mapping patterns of genomic diversity within and among populations, and investigating these patterns in the context of population declines, we can provide conservation managers with data critical to informed decision-making. This includes the identification of populations that are candidates for genetic management, the importance of remnant island and insurance/translocated populations for the conservation of genetic diversity, and the characterization of putative evolutionarily significant units.

44,2022,"Nabat ml: utilizing deep learning to enable crowdsourced development of automated, scalable solutions for documenting north american bat populations","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Bats play crucial ecological roles and provide valuable ecosystem services, yet many populations face serious threats from various ecological disturbances. The north american bat monitoring program (nabat) aims to use its technology infrastructure to assess status and trends of bat populations, while developing innovative and community-driven conservation solutions. Here, we present nabat ml, an automated machine-learning algorithm that improves the scalability and scientific transparency of nabat acoustic monitoring. This model combines signal processing techniques and convolutional neural networks (cnns) to detect and classify recorded bat echolocation calls. We developed our cnn model with internet-based computing resources (âcloud environmentâ), and trained it on >600,000 spectrogram images. We also incorporated species range maps to improve the robustness and accuracy of the model for future âunseenâ data. We evaluated model performance using a comprehensive, independent, holdout dataset. Nabat ml successfully distinguished 31 classes (30 species and a noise class) with overall weighted-average accuracy and precision rates of 92%, and â¥90% classification accuracy for 19 of the bat species. Using a single cloud-environment computing instance, the entire model training process took <16â h. Synthesis and applications. Our convolutional neural network (cnn)-based model, nabat ml, classifies 30 north american bat species using their recorded echolocation calls with an overall accuracy of 92%. In addition to providing highly accurate species-level classification, nabat ml and its outputs are compatible with bayesian and other statistical techniques for measuring uncertainty in classification. Our model is open-source and reproducible, enabling future implementations as software on end-user devices and cloud-based web applications. These qualities make nabat ml highly suitable for applications ranging from grassroots community science initiatives to big-data methods developed and implemented by researchers and professional practitioners. We believe the transparency and accessibility of nabat ml will encourage broad-scale participation in bat monitoring, and enable development of innovative solutions needed to conserve north american bat species.

45,2022,"Community science data provide evidence for upward elevational range shifts by eastern himalayan birds","Biotropica","The ongoing climate crisis is a significant threat to global biodiversity. As earth warms, many species respond by shifting their geographical ranges either polewards, or in mountainous regions, upslope towards higher elevations, presumably to track suitable thermal environments. Upslope range shifts are of particular concern in tropical mountain ranges because: (a) tropical species are particularly thermally sensitive; (b) species moving upwards could become locally extirpated as they run out of habitable space; and (c) tropical mountains harbor a high fraction of earth's terrestrial biodiversity. Rapid upslope shifts can, therefore, result in significant biodiversity losses. We used community science data over a 13-year period to evaluate whether 93 eastern himalayan bird species might be shifting to higher elevations. To do this, we analyzed changes in their occurrence probabilities in ebird checklists from birdwatching hotspots at fixed elevations. We found patterns consistent with upslope range shifts; species with elevational ranges primarily below hotspot elevations show increases in their occurrence probability over time, and those with most of their elevational ranges above a hotspot elevation decline in occurrence probability. Our findings are suggestive of rapid responses to climate change by eastern himalayan birds. We caution that eastern himalayan bird species might be at special risk from increasing global temperatures because of heightened thermal sensitivity coupled with high rates of warming in the region. To remain resilient in the face of climate change, eastern himalayan birds likely require undisturbed habitats spanning entire elevational gradients, to track rising temperatures by moving to higher elevations.

46,2022,"Long-term effects of rewilding on species composition: 22 years of raptor monitoring in the chernobyl exclusion zone","Restoration Ecology","Large-scale rewilding has been proposed as an effective method to combat the global biodiversity crisis, although there is a lack of data to support this. Rewilding generally refers to a process that allows nature to recover by reducing human interference, without the predefined end-goal that more traditional restoration projects usually have. The chernobyl exclusion zone (cez) is perhaps the most famous example of passive rewilding (rewilding with little or no management), but until now, most research has focused on the impact of radiation on wildlife rather than on rewilding. Here, we analyze species composition change of raptors in the belarusian cez over a 22-year period, starting 12 years after the accident, alongside national raptor monitoring data. Generalist and farmland-associated mesopredators, super-abundant at the beginning of our study, strongly declined, as open habitats (former agricultural land) rewetted or became overgrown. Increase in waterlogged areas saw wetland specialists increase in abundance, including two species locally extinct from the area before the accident: greater spotted eagle (endangered in europe) and white-tailed eagle. Greater spotted eagles are an indicator of wetland habitat quality, and while declining throughout europe in recent decades, they have increased from zero to at least 13 pairs, over the whole belarusian cez. Our research is evidence that rewilding could be an effective way of restoring species and species interactions found in near-natural habitats, and if human interferences in ecological processes are reduced, a priori restoration goals and continued management are not always necessary to conserve threatened species.

To investigate these impacts, we characterized the fish community's composition by environmental dna metabarcoding in the urban and suburban sites along xiang river in central china. The results showed that 32 species were identified, and most species were from cypriniform. The analysis indicated no significant differences in fish communities among the three urban areas. However, significant differences were observed between the bank solidified and non-solidified areas, which indicated that the channelization significantly influenced the biodiversity and abundances. An alien species, clarias gariepinus, was discovered in all examined sites, and it was negatively associated with ten native species. Furthermore, human populations and acidification were also negatively related to diversity. Our findings clearly showed that the consequences of anthropogenic activities shaped ichthyofauna and caused biodiversity loss in the urban river.

48,2022,"How modified landscapes filter rare species and modulate the regional pool of ecological traits?","Hydrobiologia","Common and rare species differ in their level of dispersal ability and habitat specialization, and thus should respond to distinct assembly rules. Rare species are much more spatially restricted and usually show higher habitat specialization, so they can be much more vulnerable to landscape changes than common species. We simulated three species-loss scenarios to assess how different groups of stream fish species respond to environmental and spatial variables and how potential extinctions affected regional functional richness and the average functional distinctiveness. Rare and common species contribute similarly to the global functional richness, but the loss of common species led to a marked decrease in local redundancy. Whilst intermediate and rare species are regulated by dispersal, dominant species respond to niche processes and are more affected by land-use changes. Therefore, common and rare species are under distinct assembly rules and may exhibit distinct responses in the face of environmental anthropization. Addressing rare species is often overlooked, despite constant claims regarding their importance and their frequently concerning conservation status. Accounting for their rarity can offer a more refined look at the responses of species to human modifications, providing valuable information on how to tackle biodiversity loss.

50,2022,"Bending the curve: simple but massive conservation action leads to landscape-scale recovery of amphibians","Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America","Success stories are rare in conservation science, hindered also by the research-implementation gap, where scientific insights rarely inform practice and practical implementation is rarely evaluated scientifically. Amphibian population declines, driven by multiple stressors, are emblematic of the freshwater biodiversity crisis. Habitat creation is a straightforward conservation action that has been shown to locally benefit amphibians, as well as other taxa, but does it benefit entire amphibian communities at large spatial scales? Here, we evaluate a landscape-scale pond-construction program by fitting dynamic occupancy models to 20 y of monitoring data for 12 pond-breeding amphibian species in the swiss state aargau, a densely populated area of the swiss lowlands with intensive land use. After decades of population declines, the number of occupied ponds increased statewide for 10 out of 12 species, while one species remained stable and one species further declined between 1999 and 2019. Despite regional differences, in 77% of all 43 regional metapopulations, the colonization and subsequent occupation of new ponds stabilized (14%) or increased (63%) metapopulation size. Likely mechanisms include increased habitat availability, restoration of habitat dynamics, and increased connectivity between ponds. Colonization probabilities reflected species-specific preferences for characteristics of ponds and their surroundings, which provides evidence-based information for future pond construction targeting specific species. The relatively simple but landscape-scale and persistent conservation action of constructing hundreds of new ponds halted declines and stabilized or increased the state-wide population size of all but one species, despite ongoing pressures from other stressors in a human-dominated landscape.

51,2022,"Effects of habitat degradation on bird functional diversity: a field test in the valdivian rainforest","Forest Ecology And Management","Deforestation and forest degradation are among the main biodiversity loss drivers worldwide. The expansion of productive activities, such as forest plantations, often results in the loss and degradation of native forests, affecting native species in many ways. While many studies have assessed the effects of habitat degradation on taxonomic diversity, the effects on functional diversity have been little explored. Functional diversity provides a robust framework for understanding how anthropogenic disturbance changes biodiversity. We assessed how bird functional diversity changes along a habitat degradation gradient in the valdivian rainforests (southern chile). We used four functional diversity indices and compared four habitat types (old-growth, secondary, and logged native forests and exotic plantations) to assess how functional diversity changes depending on habitat structure and bird life history, and behavioral traits. We found that most functional diversity differences occur between old growth and secondary native forests, being the latter the less functionally diverse habitat. Further, secondary forests lack natural tree cavities, and birds nesting there are more prone to be affected by brood parasitism. Changes in habitat structure seem to be determinant for bird functional diversity along a habitat degradation gradient. Therefore, habitat degradation can lead to functional homogenization beyond changes in species richness or abundance, with less evident ecological consequences.

52,2022,"Large-scale mammal monitoring: the potential of a citizen science camera-trapping project in the united kingdom","Ecological Solutions And Evidence","In light of global biodiversity loss, there is an increasing need for large-scale wildlife monitoring. This is difficult for mammals, since they can be elusive and nocturnal. In the united kingdom, there is a lack of systematic, widespread mammal monitoring, and a recognized deficiency of data. Innovative new approaches are required. We developed mammalweb, a portal to enable uk-wide camera trapping by a network of citizen scientists and partner organizations. Mammalweb citizen scientists contribute to both the collection and classification of camera trap data. Following trials in 2013â2017, mammalweb has grown organically to increase its geographic reach (e.g. â¼2000 sites in britain). It has so far provided the equivalent of over 340 camera trap-years of wild mammal monitoring, and produced nearly 440,000 classified image sequences and videos, of which, over 180,000 are mammal detections. We describe mammalweb, its background, its development and the novel approaches we have for participation. We consider the data collected by mammalweb participants, especially in light of their relevance to the main goals of wildlife monitoring: to provide spatial data, abundance data and temporal behavioural data. Mammalweb can complement existing approaches to mammal monitoring. Explicit accounting for spatial and temporal patterns in animal activity enables accounting of bias relative to ad hoc observational data. Estimating abundance presents challenges, as for many camera-trapping studies, but we discuss the potential of the data as they stand, and opportunities to advance their value for abundance estimation. Challenges remain to mammalweb's central missions of enhancing engagement with and connection to nature, and delivering policy-relevant data on britain's wild mammals. We discuss these challenges and the opportunities they provide for advances in respect of engagement, science and financial security. Our approach reduces administrative burden and increases spatial coverage and, as such, mammalweb provides a useful addition to existing case studies of citizen science camera-trapping program design. We believe mammalweb is an important step towards fulfilling calls for uk-wide mammal monitoring and our description of challenges identifies an agenda for fulfilling that purpose.

53,2022,"Amphibian collapses increased malaria incidence in central america","Environmental Research Letters","Biodiversity in ecosystems plays an important role in supporting human welfare, including regulating the transmission of infectious diseases. Many of these services are not fully-appreciated due to complex environmental dynamics and lack of baseline data. Multicontinental amphibian decline due to the fungal pathogen batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd) provides a stark example. Even though amphibians are known to affect natural food websâincluding mosquitoes that transmit human diseasesâthe human health impacts connected to their massive decline have received little attention. Here we leverage a unique ensemble of ecological surveys, satellite data, and newly digitized public health records to show an empirical link between a wave of bd-driven collapse of amphibians in costa rica and panama and increased human malaria incidence. Subsequent to the estimated date of bd-driven amphibian decline in each âcountyâ (canton or distrito), we find that malaria cases are significantly elevated for several years. For the six year peak of the estimated effect, the annual expected county-level increase in malaria ranges from 0.76 to 1.1 additional cases per 1000 population. This is a substantial increase given that cases country-wide per 1000 population peaked during the timeframe of our study at approximately 1.5 for costa rica and 1.1 for panama. This previously unidentified impact of biodiversity loss illustrates the often hidden human welfare costs of conservation failures. These findings also show the importance of mitigating international trade-driven spread of similar emergent pathogens like batrachochytrium salamandrivorans. Â© 2022 the author(s).

54,2022,"A multifaceted index of population health to detect risk-prone populations and underlying stressors in wildlife","Biological Conservation","Local declines of wild populations represent the most visible part of biodiversity loss, and their detection often relies on long-term surveys. An alternative to identify risk-prone populations is to use indicators informing on their general health (i.e., their general fitness and ability to cope with changing environment) based on simple and complementary parameters estimated from snapshot sampling. However, most studies on wildlife population health focus on one or only a few parameters, yielding potentially biased conclusions for conservation. Here, we developed a multifaceted index of population health by combining 3 complementary indicators, namely pathological, ecological, and genetic indicators, based on an integrative approach traditionally used to assess ecosystem multifunctionality. We investigated their complementarity and relevance for detecting brown trout (salmo trutta) risk-prone populations at a large spatial scale, and the underlying environmental stressors. The multifaceted health index properly represented the individual indicators' complementary information. It identified a cluster of moderately risk-prone populations and raised the alarm for one population. Each indicator was individually associated with distinct environmental stressors relevant for brown trout requirements. The multifaceted health index highlighted surrounding agricultural land and oxygen concentration as the most impacting environmental factors for the general health and sustainability of brown trout populations. The implementation of such integrative index can be transferred to a wide range of species and contexts. This index therefore provides to environmental managers and conservationists a snapshot and easily operated tool to identify risk-prone populations and areas to restore or conserve.

55,2022,"Interactions between land use, taxonomic group and aspects and levels of diversity in a brazilian savanna: implications for the use of bioindicators","Journal Of Applied Ecology","The conversion of natural habitats into anthropogenic uses is a key driver of global biodiversity loss, but effects can vary among taxa and diversity metrics. This has important implications for the use of bioindicators in land management. We evaluated the local-scale responses of multiple faunal taxa to land-use change in the brazilian cerrado measuring different aspects (taxonomic and functional) and levels (alpha and beta) of diversity. We compared ant, dung beetle and bird assemblages inhabiting remnants of natural habitat (savanna and semi-deciduous forest) with those found in cattle pastures, soy fields or eucalyptus plantations. Species richness was markedly higher in natural habitats for ants and birds but not for dung beetles. Effects on functional alpha diversity were taxon specific and there was not such a contrast between natural and anthropogenic habitats. Patterns of functional beta diversity were correlated with patterns of taxonomic beta diversity and were also taxon specific. For dung beetles, site-to-site variation in taxonomic and functional composition was greatest in forests, whereas birds tended to present greater spatial turnover and ants greater nestedeness in the anthropogenic than in the natural habitats. Among the three anthropogenic land uses, tree plantations presented the most similar composition to natural habitat for all taxa. Overall, similarity in taxonomic and functional composition between natural and anthropogenic habitats was greater for savanna than forest. Synthesis and applications. The responses of ant, dung beetle and bird assemblages to land-use change in the cerrado were highly variable. Nonetheless, results indicate that the extent of impacts on biodiversity reflects the extent of habitat transformation and that impacts at a landscape scale may be reduced by a mix of land uses. We showed that effects were more severe from a taxonomic than from a functional perspective, for the forest than for the savanna-associated fauna, for the ant and bird than for the dung beetle fauna, and often in lands devoted to intensive agriculture rather than to pastoralism or plantation forestry. Our findings can help guide the selection and assessment of indicator taxa and the interpretation of exactly what they are indicating. Â© 2022 the authors.

56,2022,"Habitat fragmentation rather than habitat amount or habitat split reduces the diversity and abundance of ground-dwelling anurans within forest remnants of the brazilian cerrado","Journal For Nature Conservation","Rampant deforestation has caused the loss and fragmentation of natural habitats, which has precipitated a global biodiversity crisis. Research on how land-use change contributes to a loss of biodiversity is urgently needed, especially in ecosystems that have undergone rapid anthropogenic changes. We sought to investigate the extent to which habitat loss, fragmentation, and habitat split (the separation of forest and aquatic habitats) negatively influenced taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, total abundance, and the individual abundances of five anuran species in the brazilian cerrado. We sampled anurans between december 2017 and march 2018 using pitfall traps at sites distributed along a gradient of habitat fragmentation/habitat split: unfragmented forest, forest fragments without habitat split, and forest fragments with habitat split. Forest cover was measured within a 1-km radius of each site. Sites within unfragmented forests had higher taxonomic and functional diversities than either fragment type. Taxonomic diversity was highly correlated with functional diversity, but we did not find a pattern to the loss of functional traits. Total anuran abundance and the abundances of chiasmocleis albopunctata, physalaemus cuvieri, and rhinella diptycha were higher in unfragmented forests compared to forest fragments. No species was more abundant in fragments than in unfragmented forests. Our results indicate that the fragmentation of forests by agricultural land use is directly and indirectly responsible for the loss of taxonomic and functional diversity, as well as for reducing population sizes of ground-dwelling anurans. Although we did not find a distinct effect of habitat split on ground-dwelling anurans, our study underscores the importance of preserving continuous forest habitats for the maintenance of anuran diversity in the cerrado.

57,2022,"Winter severity affects occupancy of spring- and summer-breeding anurans across the eastern united states","Diversity And Distributions","Aim: climate change is an increasingly important driver of biodiversity loss. The ectothermic nature of amphibians may make them particularly sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation regimes, adding to declines from other threats. While active season environmental conditions can influence growth and survival, effects of variation in winter conditions on population dynamics are less well-studied. Given that extreme winter temperatures can influence amphibian survival and fitness, we expected that increased winter severityâas measured by variability in winter temperatures and snow coverâwould be associated with decreased occupancy, and that populations that experience more severe winters would have the largest sensitivities and show the greatest declines. Location: eastern united states. Time period: 2001â2015. Major taxa studied: anurans. Methods: we used large-scale citizen science data from the eastern half of the united states, a diverse biogeographic and climatic region, to assess how variation in winter severity influenced occupancy dynamics (i.e. Presence or absence of species across sites and years) of 11 spring and summer breeding anuran species. Results: most species had increased occupancy in years with greater than average snow cover and warmer than average mean winter temperatures. Surprisingly, climatic conditions in winter affected occupancy dynamics of species with varying life history characteristics, including both spring and summer breeding species, those that overwinter under the soil, and those that overwinter in ponds and stream beds. For two wide-ranging species (lithobates catesbeianus and lithobates clamitans), colder winter temperatures reduced occupancy more at northern latitudes, while the association between days of snow cover and latitude was equivocal. Main conclusions: as the climate continues to change, expected reductions in snowpack may reduce occupancy of already declining anuran populations, while milder winters may improve overwinter survival for some species. The contradictory impacts of temperature and snow cover illustrate the importance of considering multi-dimensional impacts of climate change on anuran populations. Published 2022.

Geckos are particularly vulnerable to habitat alterations due to their small range and their restricted and specific terrestrial habits. However, our understanding of how introduced plants affect geckos, is poor. In this study, we investigate the potential effects of non-native and invasive neo-tropical tree cedrela odorata on the critically endangered electric blue gecko, lygodactylus williamsi, and its sole habitat, pandanus rabaiensis. We used 107 square (10 m x 10 m) sample plots distributed systematically throughout the forest to assess the extent and effects of c. Odorata on p. Rabaiensis forest patches. We compared the abundance of l. Williamsi on 125 p. Rabaiensis trees growing in a mixture with c. Odorata, native trees, and in pure stands and at three canopy cover categories (0â30%, >30â50%, and > 50%). We found an inverse relationship between the abundance of c. Odorata trees (diameter at breast height (dbh)> 10 cm) and the abundance of p. Rabaiensis. Spatially, the two trees dominated different parts of the forest. In contrast, the abundance of l. Williamsi was not significantly affected by the presence of c. Odorata. However, change in the canopy cover of the trees growing above the p. Rabaiensis significantly affected the abundance of l. Williamsi. The abundance of l. Williamsi in a 0â30% cover was significantly higher than 30â50% and > 50% canopy covers. The findings of this study suggest that if left unmanaged, c. Odorata could continue to take up the space that could be occupied by p. Rabaiensis and other native plants, and thus limit the population size of an endangered species.

59,2022,"The critically endangered hainan gibbon (nomascus hainanus) population increases but not at the maximum possible rate","International Journal Of Primatology","With the ongoing global biodiversity crisis in the anthropocene, it is critical to understand how to save endangered species to âbend the curveâ of biodiversity decline. The hainan gibbon (nomascus hainanus) is a critically endangered species that is endemic to hainan island. We performed two synchronized total count surveys in hainan tropic rain forest national park in november and december of 2020 and 2021 by locating gibbon groups from their morning calls and conducting detailed counts in all potential habitat fragments. We compared our findings with existing data to model the population trend, and analyzed the potential and realized reproductive potentials. We found 5 groups with a total of 33 gibbons in 2020 and 35 in 2021, including 4 and 6 solitary individuals respectively. This is an increase of 169% since 2003, when there were 13 individuals with 2 groups and 2 solitary individuals. Logistic and linear curves fitted the 2003-2021 population census data equally well. Although the population is growing, it has not realized its full reproductive potential (when all adult females give births at 24-month intervals), suggesting that external factors like available habitat, as well as nutritional, physiological, and behavioral factors may be limiting the population. The gibbonâs recovery demonstrates that establishing a nature reserve with regular patrols, banning logging, curbing poaching, and environmental education have been effective. Because the hainan gibbon population is still extremely small, carefully planned conservation actions, including an ambitious forest restoration program, will be needed to ensure the speciesâ continued survival.

60,2022,"Evaluation of ongoing crested ibis (nipponia nippon) reintroduction using an integrated population model and bayesian population viability analysis","Ibis","Reintroduction has often been used as a technique for re-establishing self-sustaining animal populations that have become extinct within their indigenous range. To achieve conservation success, it is essential to accurately assess the demographic parameters and the iucn red list criteria of the population. However, acquiring data on all indicators and estimating criteria according to established definitions can be challenging. Here, we developed an integrated population model (ipm) and population viability analysis (pva) framework to estimate all demographic parameters and criteria for a reintroduced population of crested ibis nipponia nippon, and to project population dynamics under a range of release scenarios on sado island, japan. Our ipm-pva framework integrated roost count and markâresight data for 415 released and 203 wild-hatched individuals, as well as reproductive performance for a total of 575 pairs. We aimed to assess survival, reproductive success, population size, number of mature individuals and population projection. In the first year after release, the estimated apparent annual survival rate was 0.566 [bayesian credible intervals (cri) 0.518â0.614]; however, this rate increased after 1 year (0.865; cri 0.836â0.892). Wild-hatched juveniles exhibited a high survival rate (0.757; cri 0.670â0.838) that was just lower than that of adults (0.899; cri 0.844â0.949). The reproductive success rate varied with pair attributes (releasedâreleased pair: 0.245, cri 0.194â0.299; releasedâwild pair: 0.377, cri 0.281â0.471; wildâwild pair: 0.350, cri 0.237â0.471). Total population size was estimated to be 457 individuals (cri 384â525), with 261 mature individuals (cri 211â304) in june 2021. The probability of crested ibis extinction in the next five generations was 0%, even if the release was discontinued. Our comprehensive case study demonstrated the effectiveness of ipm-pva for the evaluation of ongoing reintroduction programmes.

61,2022,"Climate change threatens striped hyena (hyaena hyaena) distribution in nepal","Mammal Research","Climate change can be expected to alter ecosystems and influence the spatial distribution of species. Understanding the effects of climate change on species distribution can help develop effective conservation protocols to tackle further biodiversity loss. Striped hyena (hyaena hyaena) global populations appear to follow an overall decreasing trend as the species faces numerous threats. Hyena presence location data was collected, and we utilized a maxent species distribution model to predict current and future distribution patterns in nepal. We used two distinct representative concentration pathway (rcp) values (rcp 4.5 and rcp 8.5) to determine potential impacts on hyena distribution. We found that hyena current suitable habitat in nepal extends over 22,000 km2 and is projected to significantly decrease in both (rcp 4.5 and rcp 8.5) scenarios. In terms of habitat reduction, we further showed that rcp 8.5 was more adverse than rcp 4.5. We found that the chure hills and the terai regions hold the largest extent of hyena habitat in nepal. Hyena habitat reduction was comparatively lower within the protected areas. Future projections, however, portend severe consequences for the speciesâ survival as suitable habitat areas will be drastically reduced in the next 50â years. Further research on hyena microhabitat suitability under anthropogenic and topographic variables will be useful for future conservation policies.

62,2022,"The two extinctions of the carolina parakeet conuropsis carolinensis","Bird Conservation International","Due to climate change and habitat conversion, estimates of the resulting levels of species extinction over the next century are alarming. Devising conservation solutions will require many different approaches, including examining the extinction processes of recently extinct species. Given that parrots are one of the most threatened groups of birds, information regarding parrot extinction is pressing. While most recent parrot extinctions have been island endemics, the carolina parakeet conuropsis carolinensis had an 18th-century range covering nearly half of the present-day united states, yet mostly disappeared by the end of the 19th century. Despite a great deal of speculation, the major cause of its extinction remains unknown. Establishing the date when a species went extinct is one of the first steps in determining what caused their extinction. While there have been estimates of their extinction date, these analyses used a limited dataset and did not include observational data. We used a recently published, extensive dataset of carolina parakeet specimens and observations combined with a bayesian extinction estimating model to determine the most likely extinction dates. By considering each of the two subspecies independently, we found that they went extinct 30 years apart: the western subspecies c. C. Ludovicianus going extinct around 1914 and the eastern subspecies c. C. Carolinensis either in the late 1930s or mid-1940s. Had we only considered all observations together, this pattern would have been obscured, possibly missing a major clue in solving the mystery of the parakeet's extinction. Since the carolina parakeet was a wide-ranging species that went extinct during a period of rapid agricultural and industrial expansion, conditions that mirror those occurring in many parts of the world where parrot diversity is highest, any progress we make in unraveling the mystery of their disappearance may be vital to modern conservation efforts.

63,2022,"A theory of change to reverse the current mexican freshwater fish extinction crisis","Frontiers In Environmental Science","Freshwater ecosystems are considered amongst the most imperiled on earth, since rivers, lakes, wetlands, and other surface waters receive most of the impacts from unsustainable human activities. This has had measurable impacts on freshwater species, and more specifically on freshwater fishes, as data from the red list show that 23.5% of the 11,937 freshwater fish species evaluated so far, are classified as threatened. Mexico is not exempt from this situation, as a recent report demonstrates that 39.9% of mexican freshwater fishes are threatened, and there are 21 lost species (extinct + extinct in the wild), the highest number for any country or region of the world. Here we develop a theory of change (toc) to guide management interventions when seeking to prevent further freshwater fish extinctions in mexico and reversing the current extinction crisis. We describe four thematic areas of intervention: (1) restoration and reintroduction aimed at eight extinct in the wild and four regionally extinct species, (2) conservation management prioritizing 39 critically endangered species, distinguishing between those inhabiting protected areas, water parks, and those with no management nor protection, (3) explorations to find eight possibly extinct species, and (4) communication and outreach to gain support for conservation interventions. The framework has been developed as a tool for conservation advocates and policymakers to implement and monitor change that prevents extinctions, but also to seek and attract funding. It is also meant to guide different levels of government in setting priorities for conservation interventions.

64,2022,"Organic farming positively affects the vitality of passerine birds in agricultural landscapes","Agriculture, Ecosystems And Environment","Conventional farming has been implicated in global biodiversity loss, with many farmland birds in decline. Organic farming is often considered a more ecological alternative since it generally hosts greater faunal diversity. To date, the impact of conventional agriculture on the decline in avian species has mainly been assessed through the lens of biodiversity loss; few studies have examined the effects of conventional farming on individual life-history trait components. Behaviour represents the final integrated outcome of a range of biochemical and physiological pathways and can be considered a proxy of health as it is more sensitive than other life-history traits, potentially allowing environmental changes to be better tracked. The goal of this study was to understand how exposure to conventional versus organic farming affects the behaviour of passerine birds in real conditions. By sampling 6 species of passerine birds in 10 hedgerows in organic landscapes and 10 hedgerows in conventional landscapes during the breeding period, we found evidence that organic farming sharply increased the vitality of individuals, irrespective of species. This was measured through behaviour such as flee attempts, aggressivity, pecking and distress calls when captured, all of which were higher in birds caught in organic hedges than those caught in conventional landscapes. We posit that passerines living in organically farmed landscapes benefit from reduced pesticide exposure rather than a greater abundance of food, as body condition was identical in the two contexts. These findings suggest that the behaviour of passerines can be a useful indicator of the state of the environment and can thus serve as an early warning of specific environmental change in agricultural areas. Further studies assessing the life-history traits of farmland birds may be a valuable aid to understanding the impact of conventional agriculture on biodiversity.

Tokay geckos (gekko gecko) are among the most traded reptile species worldwide. In hong kong, pet and tcm markets sell tokay geckos while wild populations also persist. To clarify connections between trade sources and destinations, we compared genetics and stable isotopes of wild tokays in local and non-local populations to dried individuals from tcm markets across hong kong. We found that tcm tokays are likely not of local origin. Most wild tokays were related to individuals in south china, indicating a probable natural origin. However, two populations contained individuals more similar to distant populations, indicating pet trade origins. Our results highlight the complexity of wildlife trade impacts within trade hubs. Such trade dynamics complicate local legal regulation when endangered species are protected, but the same species might also be non-native and possibly damaging to the environment.

66,2022,"Putting sharks on the map: a global standard for improving shark area-based conservation","Frontiers In Marine Science","Area-based conservation is essential to safeguard declining biodiversity. Several approaches have been developed for identifying networks of globally important areas based on the delineation of sites or seascapes of importance for various elements of biodiversity (e.g., birds, marine mammals). Sharks, rays, and chimaeras are facing a biodiversity crisis with an estimated 37% of species threatened with extinction driven by overfishing. Yet spatial planning tools often fail to consider the habitat needs critical for their survival. The important shark and ray area (isra) approach is proposed as a response to the dire global status of sharks, rays, and chimaeras. A set of four globally standardized scientific criteria, with seven sub-criteria, was developed based on input collated during four shark, biodiversity, and policy expert workshops conducted in 2022. The isra criteria provide a framework to identify discrete, three-dimensional portions of habitat important for one or more shark, ray, or chimaera species, that have the potential to be delineated and managed for conservation. The isra criteria can be applied to all environments where sharks occur (marine, estuarine, and freshwater) and consider the diversity of species, their complex behaviors and ecology, and biological needs. The identification of isras will guide the development, design, and application of area-based conservation initiatives for sharks, rays, and chimaeras, and contribute to their recovery.

We use a comprehensive set of continuous morphological traits extracted from museum collections of 8,455 bird species, including geometric morphometric beak shape data,9 and sequentially remove species from those at most to least threat of extinction. We find evidence of morphological, but not phylogenetic, homogenization across the avian class, with species becoming more alike in terms of their morphology. We find that most biome and ecoregions are expected to lose morphological diversity at a greater rate than predicted by species loss alone, with the most imperiled regions found in east asia and the himalayan uplands and foothills. Only a small proportion of assemblages are threatened with phylogenetic homogenization, in particular parts of indochina. Species extinctions will lead to a major loss of avian ecological strategies, but not a comparable loss of phylogenetic diversity. As the decline of species with unique traits and their replacement with more widespread generalist species continues, the protection of assemblages at most risk of morphological and phylogenetic homogenization should be a key conservation priority.

68,2022,"Freshwater fish biodiversity restoration in floodplain rivers requires connectivity and habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales","Science Of The Total Environment","With a sixth mass extinction looming and freshwater biodiversity declining at unprecedented rates, evaluating ecological efficacy of river restoration efforts is critical in combatting global biodiversity loss. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the functioning for fishes of 46 river restoration projects in the river rhine, one of the world's most heavily engineered lowland rivers. Floodplains with permanent, either one- or two-sided lateral connectivity to the main channel, favour total fish abundance, and are essential as nursery areas for riverine fishes. Habitat heterogeneity had a strong positive effect on species richness but was negatively related with fish abundances. However, the effects of environmental variables varied between ecological groups and spatial scales. Surprisingly, richness of critical rheophilic fishes declined with large-scale habitat heterogeneity (~1000 m), while it increased at small scales (~100 m), possibly because of the presence of unfavourable habitats for this ecological group at larger scales. Clearly, there is no one-size-fits-all design for river restoration projects. Whether a river section is free-flowing or impounded dictates the scope and efficacy of restoration projects and, within a river section, multiple complementary restoration projects might be key to mitigate freshwater fish biodiversity loss. An essential element for success is that these projects should retain permanent lateral connection to the main channel.

69,2022,"The effectiveness of a large protected area to conserve a global endemism hotspot may vanish in the face of climate and land-use changes","Frontiers In Ecology And Evolution","Endemic vertebrates are a crucial component of biodiversity, yet face disproportionally high extinction risk as climate and land-use changes drive habitat loss. Large protected areas are therefore deemed necessary to mitigate biodiversity loss. In 2021, chinaâs giant panda national park (gpnp, 27,134 km2) was established in one of the global endemism hotspots. In this study we ask the question whether this large national park is able to conserve the many threatened endemic vertebrates occurring in the region in the face of climate and land-use changes, in order to assess the long-term effectiveness of the gpnp. We used species distribution modeling techniques to project the distributions of 40 threatened terrestrial (and freshwater) endemic vertebrates under land-use and climate change scenarios ssp2â4.5, ssp3â7.0 and ssp5â8.5 in 2081â2100, and assessed the extent to which their distributions are covered by the gpnp, now and in the future. We found that by 2081â2100, two thirds of the threatened endemic vertebrates are predicted to lose part (15â79%, n = 4) of or (nearly) their entire (80â100% loss, n = 23) range under all three climate and land-use change scenarios. Consequently, fewer species are predicted to occur in the gpnp than at present. Our findings confirm the high vulnerability of threatened endemic species to climate and land-use changes, despite protected areas. Habitat loss due to climate and land-use changes elevate extinction risk of species in endemism hotspots across the globe. Urgent, widespread and intensified mitigation measures and adaptation measures are required at a landscape scale for effective conservation efforts in the future.

70,2022,"Tools and metrics for species prioritization for conservation planning and action: case studies for antelopes and small mammals","Diversity","Given the scale of the current biodiversity loss, setting conservation priorities is essential to direct scarce resources to where they will be most effective. Many prioritization schemes have been described by using a wide range of criteria that vary across taxonomic groups, spatial scales, and ecological, socio-economic, and governance contexts. Currently, there is no single prioritization process applicable to all situations, nor is there a list of agreed metrics. The iucn ssc antelope specialist group and the small mammal specialist group recently performed species prioritization exercises based on a similar approach. The variables used included biological, socio-political, and feasibility criteria. The two exercises contained both common and some unique variables, arranged in a matrix for the target species (29 threatened antelopes and 19 critically endangered mexican small mammals, respectively). The asg framework provided a global summary of the antelope priorities, which can be updated and adapted to the national level. The smsg matrix was applied in a regional workshop to select species for which the likelihood of implementing conservation actions was high and led to conservation action plans being developed for six species. The framework we jointly developed in theory can be applied to other taxa, certainly all mammals and perhaps most vertebrates.

The increasing rarity of many taxa renders comprehensive sampling difficult, further compounding the problem. Vertebrate lineages such as birds, which are thought to be taxonomically well understood, are therefore used as indicator groups for mapping and quantifying global extinction. To test whether extinction patterns are adequately gauged in well-studied groups, we implemented ancient-dna protocols and retrieved whole genomes from the historic dna of museum specimens in a widely known songbird radiation of shamas (genus copsychus) that is assumed to be of least conservation concern. We uncovered cryptic diversity and an unexpected degree of hidden extinction and terminal endangerment. Our analyses reveal that >40% of the phylogenetic diversity of this radiation is already either extinct in the wild or nearly so, including the two genomically most distinct members of this group (omissus and nigricauda), which have so far flown under the conservation radar as they have previously been considered subspecies. Comparing the genomes of modern samples with those from roughly a century ago, we also found a significant decrease in genetic diversity and a concomitant increase in homozygosity affecting various taxa, including small-island endemics that are extinct in the wild as well as subspecies that remain widespread across the continental scale. Our application of modern genomic approaches demonstrates elevated levels of allelic and taxonomic diversity loss in a songbird clade that has not been listed as globally threatened, highlighting the importance of ongoing reassessments of extinction incidence even across well-studied animal groups.

The present study analyzed the flora and fauna composition, structure, and trend in pt. Geo dipa energi dieng well pad surrounding area from 2019-2021, as a critical part of the proper assessments. The study revealed that the study area was homogeneously dominated by shrubs-herbaceous plants, contributing to 60% of total species richness and abundance. Two dominant species were the introduced wild species ageratina riparia and the cultivated plant solanum tuberosum. Moreover, despite tree individual scarcity, the tree growth form was primarily constituted by introduced species with a mean abundance of 347 individuals, or 5-fold higher than native species. Acacia decurrens and cupressus sempervirens, the introduced tree species planted during the rehabilitation program, dominated the area. The homogeneous floristic composition led to a homogenization of the fauna community, particularly birds, dominated by cosmopolitan insectivorous species. Nmds analysis and shannon-diversity index also revealed that the pattern and trend among sites and years were similar, and there was an insignificant change, showing the urgency of the long-term revegetation programs to rehabilitate the ecosystem.

74,2022,"Population genomic monitoring provides insight into conservation status but no correlation with demographic estimates of extinction risk in a threatened trout","Evolutionary Applications","The current extinction crisis requires effective assessment and monitoring tools. Genetic approaches are appealing given the relative ease of field sampling required to estimate genetic diversity characteristics assumed related to population size, evolutionary potential, and extinction risk, and to evaluate hybridization with non-native species simultaneously. However, linkages between population genetic metrics of diversity from survey-style field collections and demographic estimates of population size and extinction risk are still in need of empirical examples, especially for remotely distributed species of conservation concern where the approach might be most beneficial. We capitalized on an exceptional opportunity to evaluate congruence between genetic diversity metrics and demographic-based estimates of abundance and extinction risk from a comprehensive multiple population viability analysis (mpva) in a threatened fish, the lahontan cutthroat trout (lct). We sequenced non-native trout reference samples and recently collected and archived tissue samples of most remaining populations of lct (nâ =â 60) and estimated common genetic assessment metrics, predicting minimal hybridization with non-native trout, low diversity, and declining diversity over time. We further hypothesized genetic metrics would correlate positively with mpva-estimated abundance and negatively with extinction probability. We uncovered several instances of hybridization that pointed to immediate management needs. After removing hybridized individuals, cautious interpretation of low effective population sizes (2â63) suggested reduced evolutionary potential for many lct populations. Other genetic metrics did not decline over time nor correlate with mpva-based estimates of harmonic mean abundance or 30-year extinction probability. Our results demonstrate benefits of genetic monitoring for efficiently detecting hybridization and, though genetic results were disconnected from demographic assessment of conservation status, they suggest reduced evolutionary potential and likely a higher conservation risk than currently recognized for this threatened fish. We emphasize that genetic information provides essential complementary insight, in addition to demographic information, for evaluating species status. Â© 2022 the authors.

The observed assemblage included different trophic and functional groups (from lizards and snakes to apex species among birds and mammals), as well as a 38 % of threatened and near threatened species (according to spanish and portuguese vertebrate red list and uicn list). The size (weight) of the bait outstands as a reliable predictor of the number of species (0â8 species/bait, mean = 2) and individuals (0â99 individuals/bait, mean = 5) susceptible to poisoning. The habitat where the bait was placed modulated the abundance of individuals affected (greater in open than in closed habitats). Type of bait and habitat drove the compositional variation of species. Our approach enables uncover entire species assemblages prone to illegal poisoning and their ecological drivers associated, advancing the understanding of the impact of wildlife poisoning in ecosystems.

76,2022,"Southwest china, the last refuge of continental primates in east asia","Biological Conservation","Knowledge of primate evolutionary history from the late miocene to the present in east asia is necessary to develop a conservation strategy for primates today and future. This background is especially evident from the distributions of fossil-bearing sites in the pleistocene and historical records over the past 800 years. We illustrate catarrhines' early dispersal and radiation routes, paths, and later shrinking trajectories, providing robust evidence and information for making or amending conservation strategies. Catarrhines (apes and old-world monkeys) in east asia are analyzed in this study. The results indicate that their spread during the pleistocene from the west to east remarkably involved the three river systems (yangtze, yellow, and pearl) and the coastlines, resulting in broad distributions in the far east (taiwan, korea, and japan). Unfortunately, their continental taxa significantly suffered reductions from ancient to modern holocene, leading to a tremendous biodiversity loss in east asia. These events corresponded to major periodic social upheavals and anthropogenic activities, particularly in the first half of the last century and the post-war period after 1950 that has involved unparalleled environmental devastation and natural resource depletion. Except for the taxa in taiwan and japan, primates in east asia will finally be confined to southwest china, especially a convergence-divergence center (cdc) that has played a unique role in shielding primates and other animals, as well as the plants since the later miocene. Thus, developing a specific conservation priority is critical for the cdc and its adjacent regions to mitigate primate extinction in east asia.

77,2022,"Entomological identification of the post-mortem colonization of wolf cadavers in different decomposition stages","Science And Justice","Human-driven biodiversity loss is progressively becoming a problem with dramatic consequences for the conservation of vital ecosystems. The increasing number of illegal killings of the grey wolf (canis lupus, linnaeus, 1758), a threatened species, displays the need for investigation and prosecution of such offences. Forensic entomology makes use of the knowledge about necrophagous insects to estimate a minimum time-since-death interval of the deceased person or animal, which can give important information on a possible perpetrator. The cadaver fauna along five decomposition stages of wolves in germany was investigated in the period 2014â2021. The insects from 70 wolf cadavers, originating from all over germany, were provided by the leibniz institute for zoo and wildlife research berlin. The accumulated degree day (add) model was applied for the post-mortem interval estimation on wolf cadavers for the first time. A total of 20 coleopteran species and 14 different dipteran species were discovered and identified. Almost 99 % of all insect specimens were from the order of diptera, and beetles (coleoptera) accounted for only 1 % of the cadaver fauna. The blowflies (calliphoridae) are of particular importance for forensic issues, accounting for about 66 % of all families. Carrion beetles (silphidae) were found as the second most abundant family (about 21 %). In addition, combining all cases, a steadily increasing insect species richness s was detected from early decay to advanced decay (fresh s = 8; bloated s = 12; active decay s = 21; advanced decay s = 34). In the following remains stage, the species number decreased again (s = 24). However, no significant difference in the number of species was found between the stages of decay when the cases were considered individually. The temporal pattern of insect appearance was found to be congruent with those of previous studies. Furthermore, a time of death was determined for each case and compared to the pathologist's estimates. This study provides insights into the arthropod fauna of wolf remains for the first time, applies the add-model for post-mortem interval estimation, and discusses the suitability of forensic entomology for wildlife death investigations.

78,2022,"Regional variation in responses of a vulnerable bird species to land-use and climate change","Biotropica","Climate and land-use changes are expected to negatively affect many species and ecological processes, leading to biodiversity loss. However, some species can adapt to these changes. Wide-ranging species are expected to be less impacted by such changes, but they can occur in different domains with contrasting environmental conditions, resulting in different conservation statuses along their range. To understand whether a species will overall benefit or lose with global change, we evaluated the responses of a wide-ranging but a vulnerable bird (crax fasciolata) to separate and combined effects of climate and land-use changes under different environmental policies in brazil. Using ecological niche modeling and a land-use model within the brazilian political context, we quantified climatic, habitat, and environmental suitability for crax fasciolata under historical (2000) and future (2050) scenarios. Our findings showed that environmental suitability can increase for crax fasciolata in brazil in future, but these effects vary according to the domain and the specific future scenario considered. Climatically suitable areas will increase in all scenarios, and those environmental scenarios that include better habitat conditions will provide more environmentally suitable areas for crax fasciolata. However, this increase comes from newly suitable areas in the atlantic forest and the amazon, while the pantanal, the caatinga, and the cerrado will lose environmental suitability due to native vegetation loss. Despite the availability of these new areas, reduced landscape permeability may hinder crax fasciolata from reaching them. This reinforces the urgent call for public policies for native vegetation protection, reforestation, and effective deforestation control. Abstract in portuguese is available with online material.

79,2022,"Marine protected areas ineffectively protect seagrass and coral reef fish communities in the phu quoc and an thoi archipelago, vietnam","Aquatic Conservation: Marine And Freshwater Ecosystems","The phu quoc marine protected area (mpa) is a multiple-use mpa that was established in 2007 and is a component of vietnamâs national mpa system. The mpa is divided into two spatially separated zones based on habitat type: a seagrass zone and a coral reef zone. In this study, visual census data were collected in 2018â2019 and were used to derive fish biomass and community diversity metrics as proxies for ecosystem condition and function (trophic and mobility). The effectiveness of the mpa in protecting fish communities in the seagrass and coral reef zones was evaluated. An updated characterization of the phu quoc fish communities, and an assessment of fish community variation among regions and between habitat types, is provided. In total, 125 species representing 74 genera of 40 families were recorded. Omnivores were the most abundant (38%), followed by planktivores (24%), whereas piscivores (2%) were scarce. There was an especially low density of high-value fishery target species such as haemulidae ( 20â cm only accounted for 1% of the total individuals. Species and functional composition were similar between protected and unprotected areas but differed among regions and between habitats. These results suggest that the protection of fishes provided by phu quoc mpa at the time of this study was ineffective. The taxonomic composition of fish communities has remained relatively unchanged over the last approximately 25â years, with the density of large fishes and commercial species remaining low. There is capacity to improve mpa performance by providing adequate resources for threat management and using evidence-based decision-making in management. The 2020 rezoning and expansion of the phu quoc mpa is discussed with regards to prioritizing biodiversity and coverage targets.

81,2022,"Automated distance estimation for wildlife camera trapping","Ecological Informatics","The ongoing biodiversity crisis calls for accurate estimation of animal density and abundance to identify sources of biodiversity decline and effectiveness of conservation interventions. Camera traps together with abundance estimation methods are often employed for this purpose. The necessary distances between camera and observed animals are traditionally derived in a laborious, fully manual or semi-automatic process. Both approaches require reference image material, which is both difficult to acquire and not available for existing datasets. We propose a fully automatic approach we call automated distance estimation (audit) to estimate camera-to-animal distances. We leverage existing state-of-the-art relative monocular depth estimation and combine it with a novel alignment procedure to estimate metric distances. Audit is fully automated and requires neither the comparison of observations in camera trap imagery with reference images nor capturing of reference image material at all. Audit therefore relieves biologists and ecologists from a significant workload. We evaluate audit on a zoo scenario dataset unseen during training where we achieve a mean absolute distance estimation error over all animal instances of only 0.9864 m and mean relative error (rel) of 0.113.

82,2022,"Grazing and global change factors differentially affect biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in grassland ecosystems","Global Change Biology","Grazing and global change (e.g., warming, nitrogen deposition, and altered precipitation) both contribute to biodiversity loss and alter ecosystem structure and functioning. However, how grazing and global change interactively influence plant diversity and ecosystem productivity, and their relationship remains unclear at the global scale. Here, we synthesized 73 field studies to quantify the individual and/or interactive effects of grazing and global change factors on biodiversity-productivity relationship in grasslands. Our results showed that grazing significantly reduced plant richness by 3.7% and aboveground net primary productivity (anpp) by 29.1%, but increased belowground net primary productivity (bnpp) by 9.3%. Global change factors, however, decreased richness by 8.0% but increased anpp and bnpp by 13.4% and 14.9%, respectively. Interestingly, the strength of the change in biodiversity in response to grazing was positively correlated with the strength of the change in bnpp. Yet, global change flipped these relationships from positive to negative even when combined with grazing. These results indicate that the impacts of global change factors are more dominant than grazing on the belowground biodiversity-productivity relationship, which is contrary to the pattern of aboveground one. Therefore, incorporating global change factors with herbivore grazing into earth system models is necessary to accurately predict climate-grassland carbon cycle feedbacks in the anthropocene.

83,2022,"Habitat connectivity in agricultural landscapes improving multi-functionality of constructed wetlands as nature-based solutions","Ecological Engineering","The prevention of biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes to protect ecosystem stability and functions is of major importance in itself and for the maintenance of associated ecosystem services. Intense agriculture leads to a loss in species richness and homogenization of species pools as well as the fragmentation of natural habitats and groundwater pollution. Constructed wetlands stand as nature-based solutions (nbs) to buffer the degradation of water quality by intercepting the transfer of particles, nutrients and pesticides between crops and surface waters. In karstic watersheds where sinkholes short-cut surface water directly to groundwater increasing water resource vulnerability, constructed wetlands are recommended to mitigate agricultural pollutants. Constructed wetlands also have the potential to improve landscape connectivity by providing refuge and breeding sites for wildlife, especially for amphibians. We propose here a methodology to identify optimal locations for water pollution mitigation using constructed wetlands from the perspective of habitat connectivity. We use ecological niche modelling at the regional scale to model the potential of habitat suitability for nine amphibian species, and to infer how the landscape impedes species movements. We combine those results to graph theory to identify connectivity priorities at the operational scale of an agricultural catchment area. Our framework allowed us to identify optimal areas from the point of view of the species, to analyze the effect of multifunctional constructed wetlands aiming to both reduce water pollution and to improve amphibian species habitat overall connectivity. More generally, we show the potential of habitat connectivity assessment to improve multifunctionality of nbs for pollution mitigation.

84,2022,"Potential millennial-scale avian declines by humans in southern china","Global Change Biology","Mounting observational records demonstrate human-caused faunal decline in recent decades, while accumulating archaeological evidence suggests an early biodiversity impact of human activities during the holocene. A fundamental question arises concerning whether modern wildlife population declines began during early human disturbance. Here, we performed a population genomic analysis of six common forest birds in east asia to address this question. For five of them, demographic history inference based on 25â33 genomes of each species revealed dramatic population declines by 4- to 48-fold over millennia (e.g. 2000â5000 thousand years ago). Nevertheless, summary statistics detected nonsignificant correlations between these population size trajectories and holocene temperature variations, and ecological niche models explicitly predicted extensive range persistence during the holocene, implying limited demographic consequence of holocene climate change. Further analyses suggest high negative correlations between the reconstructed population declines and human disturbance intensities and indicate a potential driver of human activities. These findings provide a deep-time and large-scale insight into the recently recognized avifaunal decline and support an early origin hypothesis of human effects on biodiversity. Overall, our study sheds light on the current biodiversity crisis in the context of long-term humanâenvironment interactions and offers a multi-evidential framework for quantitatively assessing the ecological consequences of human disturbance.

In this study, the future impact of climate and land-use changes on anatolian ground squirrels (spermophilus xanthoprymnus) was assessed. Accordingly, a hierarchical approach with two steps was used. First, ecological niche modelling was used to assess the impact of climate change in areas accessible to anatolian ground squirrels through dispersal (i.e. The impact of climate change). Second, based on the habitat preferences of ground squirrels, land-use data were used to assess the impact of land-use change in suitable bioclimatic areas for anatolian ground squirrels under present and future conditions (i.e. The combined impact of both changes). Also, priority areas for the conservation of anatolian ground squirrels were identified based on in-situ climate change refugia. This study represents a first attempt to combine niche modelling and land-use data for a species in anatolia, one of the most vulnerable regions to the drivers of biodiversity loss, because it is the region where three of biodiversity hotspots meet, and interact. Habitat suitability (i.e. Suitable habitats across suitable bioclimatic areas) was projected to decline by 19â69% in the future (depending on the scenario), mainly due to the loss of suitable bioclimatic areas (47â77%, depending on the scenario) at lower elevations and in the western part of the central anatolia and in the eastern anatolia, suggesting that anatolian ground squirrels will contract their range in the future, mainly due to climate change. Thus, in-situ climate change refugia were projected mainly in the eastern and southeastern parts of the central anatolia, suggesting these regions as priority areas for the conservation of anatolian ground squirrels.

In 1937, in response to dwindling wildlife populations, congress passed the federal aid in wildlife restoration act, known as âpittman-robertsonâ (pr). The law helped restore wildlife populations by establishing a federal role in funding state wildlife agencies enabling states to develop the infrastructure and expertise for effective wildlife conservation. Now, the 117th congress is considering the recovering america's wildlife act (rawa).

87,2022,"Mapping breeding bird species richness at management-relevant resolutions across the united states","Ecological Applications","Human activities alter ecosystems everywhere, causing rapid biodiversity loss and biotic homogenization. These losses necessitate coordinated conservation actions guided by biodiversity and species distribution spatial data that cover large areas yet have fine-enough resolution to be management-relevant (i.e., â¤5â km). However, most biodiversity products are too coarse for management or are only available for small areas. Furthermore, many maps generated for biodiversity assessment and conservation do not explicitly quantify the inherent tradeoff between resolution and accuracy when predicting biodiversity patterns. Our goals were to generate predictive models of overall breeding bird species richness and species richness of different guilds based on nine functional or life-history-based traits across the conterminous united states at three resolutions (0.5, 2.5, and 5â km) and quantify the tradeoff between resolution and accuracy and, hence, relevance for management of the resulting biodiversity maps. We summarized 18 years of north american breeding bird survey data (1992â2019) and modeled species richness using random forests, including 66 predictor variables (describing climate, vegetation, geomorphology, and anthropogenic conditions), 20 of which we newly derived. Among the three spatial resolutions, the percentage variance explained ranged from 27% to 60% (medianâ =â 54%; meanâ =â 57%) for overall species richness and 12% to 87% (medianâ =â 61%; meanâ =â 58%) for our different guilds. Overall species richness and guild-specific species richness were best explained at 5-km resolution using ~24 predictor variables based on percentage variance explained, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error values. However, our 2.5-km-resolution maps were almost as accurate and provided more spatially detailed information, which is why we recommend them for most management applications. Our results represent the first consistent, occurrence-based, and nationwide maps of breeding bird richness with a thorough accuracy assessment that are also spatially detailed enough to inform local management decisions. More broadly, our findings highlight the importance of explicitly considering tradeoffs between resolution and accuracy to create management-relevant biodiversity products for large areas.

88,2022,"Sharing land with giants: habitat preferences of galapagos tortoises on farms","Global Ecology And Conservation","One of the most pressing dilemmas of our time is determining how to satisfy the demands of a growing human population while still conserving biodiversity. Worldwide, land modification to accommodate human resource needs has caused significant declines in wildlife populations. To help minimize biodiversity loss, we must support wildlife on human-dominated land, such as farms and urban areas, but our knowledge of how to do so is lacking. Agriculture is a major driver of land modification; but also has the potential to play a role in conserving biodiversity. To support critically endangered ecosystem engineers that use farms, such as giant galapagos tortoises, we need to understand the characteristics encouraging or hindering them. To quantify tortoise habitat preferences, we assessed the relationship between tortoise density, habitat structure, and land-use type, by recording tortoise density on farms on santa cruz island, galapagos, over two years. Tortoise density was lowest in abandoned farmland and highest in tourist areas and was most strongly positively correlated with abundant ground cover, short vegetation, and few shrubs. The habitat features favoured by tortoises could potentially be manipulated to help support tortoise conservation on farms. Measuring wildlife preferences in human-dominated areas is an important step towards balancing biodiversity conservation and human-enterprise.

89,2022,"A comparison of monitoring designs to assess wildlife community parameters across spatial scales","Ecological Applications","Dedicated long-term monitoring at appropriate spatial and temporal scales is necessary to understand biodiversity losses and develop effective conservation plans. Wildlife monitoring is often achieved by obtaining data at a combination of spatial scales, ranging from local to broad, to understand the status, trends, and drivers of individual species or whole communities and their dynamics. However, limited resources for monitoring necessitates tradeoffs in the scope and scale of data collection. Careful consideration of the spatial and temporal allocation of finite sampling effort is crucial for monitoring programs that span multiple spatial scales. Here we evaluate the ability of five monitoring designsâstratified random, weighted effort, indicator unit, rotating panel, and split panelâto recover parameter values that describe the status (occupancy), trends (change in occupancy), and drivers (spatially varying covariate and an autologistic term) of wildlife communities at two spatial scales. Using an amphibian monitoring program that spans a network of us national parks as a motivating example, we conducted a simulation study for a regional community occupancy sampling program to compare the monitoring designs across varying levels of sampling effort (ranging from 10% to 50%). We found that the stratified random design outperformed the other designs for most parameters of interest at both scales and was thus generally preferable in balancing the estimation of status, trends, and drivers across scales. However, we found that other designs had improved performance in specific situations. For example, the rotating panel design performed best at estimating spatial drivers at a regional level. Thus, our results highlight the nuanced scenarios in which various design strategies may be preferred and offer guidance as to how managers can balance common tradeoffs in large-scale and long-term monitoring programs in terms of the specific knowledge gained. Monitoring designs that improve accuracy in parameter estimates are needed to guide conservation policy and management decisions in the face of broad-scale environmental challenges, but the preferred design is sensitive to the specific objectives of a monitoring program.

90,2022,"Avian species richness and tropical urbanization gradients: effects of woodland retention and human disturbance","Ecological Applications","Urbanization is a major driver of tropical biodiversity loss. In temperate regions avian species richnessâurbanization intensity relationships typically exhibit unimodal patterns, with peak richness at intermediate urbanization levels. In tropical regions, the form of such relationships and the extent to which they are moderated by patches of seminatural habitat are unclear. We address these questions in bangkok, thailand (one of the largest and most rapidly expanding tropical mega-cities) and generate conservation recommendations for tropical biodiversity in urban locations. We use repeated point count surveys at a random location, and the largest available woodland patch, in 150 1â km ã 1â km grid cells selected along the urbanization gradient. Woodland patches support higher species richness compared with randomized locations (except for non-natives), and avian species richness declines linearly with increasing urbanization. The contrast with unimodal patterns in temperate regions is probably driven by divergent patterns of habitat heterogeneity along tropical and temperate urbanization gradients. Moreover, we provide novel evidence that retaining patches of urban woodland moderates adverse impacts of urbanization on avian species richness. For most species groups, the benefits of woodland increase as urbanization intensifies, despite such woodland patches being very small (mean of 0.38 ha). Avian species richness in woodland patches is maximized, and community composition less similar to that in randomized locations, when woodland patches are larger and visited by fewer people. Assemblages of forest-dependent species (which provide additional ecological functions) have higher richness, and are less similar to those in randomized locations, in patches of woodland with higher tree species richness and biomass. Finally, species richness in randomized sites is greatest when they are closer to woodland patches, and such assemblages more closely resemble those of woodland sites. Our work highlights four strategies for tropical urban bird conservation: (1) conserving woodland patches across the urbanization gradient regardless of patch size, (2) improving the quality of existing woodland by increasing tree biomass and diversity, (3) creating additional woodland that is well distributed throughout the urban area to minimize effects of habitat isolation and (4) reducing human disturbance, especially in areas of the highest habitat quality, while ensuring that the benefits of connecting people to nature are realized in other locations.

The red list index (rli) tracks trends in the conservation status of entire species groups over time by monitoring changes in categories assigned to species. Here, we calculate this index for the worldâs fishes in 2010, using a sampled approach to the rli based on a randomly selected sample of 1,500 species, and also present rli splits for freshwater and marine systems separately. We further compare specific traits of a worldwide fish list to our sample to assess its representativeness. Overall, 15.1% of species in the sample were estimated to be threatened with extinction, resulting in a sampled rli of 0.914 for all species, 0.968 in marine and 0.862 in freshwater ecosystems. Our sample showed fishing as the principal threat for marine species, and pollution by agricultural and forestry effluents for freshwater fishes.

93,2022,"Emergent properties of species-habitat networks in an insular forest landscape","Science Advances","Deforestation and fragmentation are pervasive drivers of biodiversity loss, but how they scale up to entire landscapes remains poorly understood. Here, we apply species-habitat networks based on species co-occurrences to test the effects of insular fragmentation on multiple taxa-medium-large mammals, small nonvolant mammals, lizards, understory birds, frogs, dung beetles, orchid bees, and trees-across 22 forest islands and three continuous forest sites within a river-damming quasi-experimental landscape in central amazonia. Widespread, nonrandom local species extinctions were translated into highly nested networks of low connectance and modularity. Networks' robustness considering the sequential removal of large-to-small sites was generally low; between 5% (dung beetles) and 50% (orchid bees) of species persisted when retaining only <10 ha of islands. In turn, larger sites and body size were the main attributes structuring the networks. Our results raise the prospects that insular forest fragmentation results in simplified species-habitat networks, with distinct taxa persistence to habitat loss.

94,2022,"Tradeoffs and synergies among ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and food production in coffee agroforestry","Frontiers In Forests And Global Change","Concerns over the capacity of the worldâs existing agricultural land to provide food for the global population under climate change and continued biodiversity loss have set the stage for a prevailing narrative of inherent tradeoffs with agricultural production. Coffee, a major export of tropical countries, offers a unique opportunity to examine how different management practices can lead to a variety of outcomes in food security, ecosystem services, and biodiversity conservation. Our study examined this intersection to identify tradeoffs and synergies using compiled data from puerto rico. At the island level, we analyzed data on coffee yield and planted area under shade or sun management. At the farm level, we analyzed management variables (percent shade cover, maximum canopy height, ground cover, and food crop richness), non-provisioning ecosystem services variables (total farm carbon storage, soil organic carbon storage, coffee plant carbon biomass, and hurricane resistance and resilience), and biodiversity variables (ant, bird, and lizard richness and abundance). At the island level, we found that planted area was the most significant predictor of total production, suggesting no obvious tradeoff between production and shade management in coffee farms. At the farm level, canopy cover of shade trees was negatively correlated with ground cover and positively correlated with food crop richness, suggesting a synergy between agroforestry and subsistence food production. We detected mostly synergies associated with ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and agroforestry management and no tradeoffs among ecosystem service and biodiversity parameters. Shade canopy cover significantly increased total carbon storage, coffee plant biomass, hurricane resistance, and bird species richness. Shade canopy height had a similar positive effect on total farm carbon storage while food crop richness had a positive effect on farm resilience following hurricane maria. Ground cover was positively associated with soil carbon storage and pest-controlling lizard abundance. Tradeoffs related to agroforestry management included an inverse relationship between ground cover and hurricane resistance and more dominance of an invasive ant species in farms with higher shade canopies. We discuss the implications of practicing agroforestry principles in this smallholder coffee system and highlight opportunities to contribute to more diversified food production systems that support biodiversity and ecosystem services.

95,2022,"Temporal coherence patterns of prairie pothole wetlands indicate the importance of landscape linkages and wetland heterogeneity in maintaining biodiversity","Frontiers In Ecology And Evolution","Wetland ecosystems are diverse, productive habitats that are essential reservoirs of biodiversity. Not only are they home to numerous wetland-specialist species, but they also provide food, water, and shelter that support terrestrial wildlife populations. However, like observed patterns of biodiversity loss, wetland habitats have experienced widespread loss and degradation. In order to conserve and restore wetlands, and thereby the biodiversity they support, it is important to understand how biodiversity in wetland habitats is maintained. Habitat heterogeneity and connectivity are thought to be predominate drivers of wetland biodiversity. We quantified temporal coherence (i.e., spatial synchrony) of wetland invertebrate communities using intra-class correlations among 16 wetlands sampled continuously over 24 years to better understand the relative influences wetland heterogeneity (i.e., internal processes specific to individual wetlands and spatial connectivity and external processes occurring on the landscape) on wetland biodiversity. We found that while wetlands with different ponded-water regimes (temporarily ponded or permanently ponded) often hosted different invertebrate communities, temporal shifts in invertebrate composition were synchronous. We also found the relative importance of internal versus external forces in determining community assembly vary depending on a wetlandâs hydrologic function and climate influences. Our results confirm that heterogeneity and spatial connectivity of wetland landscapes are important drivers of wetland biodiversity.

96,2022,"Lighting up our waterways: impacts of a current mitigation strategy on riparian bats","Environmental Pollution","Increasing levels of artificial light at night (alan) are a major threat to global biodiversity and can have negative impacts on a wide variety of organisms and their ecosystems. Nocturnal species such as bats are highly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of alan. A variety of lighting management strategies have been adopted to minimise the impacts of alan on wildlife, however relatively little is known about their effectiveness. Using an experimental approach, we provide the first evidence of negative impacts of part-night lighting (pnl) strategies on bats. Feeding activity of myotis spp. Was reduced along rivers exposed to pnl despite no reduction in overall bat activity. We also provide the first evidence of negative effects of pnl on both feeding and activity for pipistrellus pipistrellus which has previously been recorded feeding under artificial light. Despite having considerable energy-saving benefits, we outline the potential negative impacts of pnl schemes for bats in riparian habitats. Pnl are unlikely to provide desired conservation outcomes for bats, and can potentially fragment important foraging habitats leading to a breakdown of functional connectivity across the landscape. We highlight the potential dichotomy for strategies which attempt to simultaneously address climate change and biodiversity loss and recommend alternative management strategies to limit the impacts of alan on biodiversity.

97,2022,"The use of cavity-nesting wild birds as agents of biological control in vineyards of central chile","Agriculture, Ecosystems And Environment","Insectivorous birds provide key ecosystem services for agricultural production, such as biological pest control. However, habitat loss and degradation by agriculture are among the main causes of biodiversity loss globally, including the recent decline in bird populations. Habitat loss has particularly affected insectivorous birds due to the associated decrease in the availability of suitable nesting sites. Our study assessed a tool of ecological intensification to increase insectivorous bird abundance and biological control in vineyards. We evaluated the effects of nest boxes on prey removal by insectivorous birds in five vineyards in central chile, using a two-year sentinel prey experimental trial. Our results showed significantly more sentinel larvae removal by birds in plots with nest boxes than control plots. Deploying the nest boxes resulted in a 43% higher consumption of sentinel prey. Therefore, we recommend using nest boxes as an environmentally-friendly method to increase native predators and enhance biological control in agricultural fields. This would have the potential to improve biodiversity conservation and maximize crop yields.

New socio-economic conditions produced a rewilding process so that cultural landscapes are being invaded by more natural habitats. We analyze the effects of landscape change on the demography and the spatial distribution of crocidura russula in six protected areas of the western mediterranean basin. The study was conducted in the period 2008â2020 on 19 live trapping plots representing the three main natural habitats of the area (scrubland, pinewood, and holm oak woodland). We used a multiscale approach to ensure that the scale of response matched landscape structure (from plot to landscape) using either vegetation profiles (lidar) and land use data obtained from years 2007 and 2017. Statistical models (multiple-season single-species occupancy models) showed that c. Russula populations were strongly associated to habitat features at the plot level. These models were used to predict occupancy at sampling units for the whole study area (850 km2), showing contrasting trends that shifted at relatively small spatial scales (expansions and retractions of species ranges). Parks showing extreme scrubland encroachment (â8% of area) and afforestation (+6%) significantly reduced habitat suitability for shrews and reductions in occupancy (â5%). Results would indicate faster changes in the spatial distribution of the target species than previously expected on the basis of climate change, driven by fast landscape changes.

100,2022,"Disappearance of an ecosystem engineer, the white-lipped peccary (tayassu pecari), leads to density compensation and ecological release","Oecologia","Given the rate of biodiversity loss, there is an urgent need to understand community-level responses to extirpation events, with two prevailing hypotheses. On one hand, the loss of an apex predator leads to an increase in primary prey species, triggering a trophic cascade of other changes within the community, while density compensation and ecological release can occur because of reduced competition for resources and absence of direct aggression. White-lipped peccary (tayassu pecariâwlp), a species that typically co-occurs with collared peccary (pecari tajacu), undergo major population crashesâoften taking 20 to 30-years for populations to recover. Using a temporally replicated camera trapping dataset, in both a pre- and post- wlp crash, we explore how wlp disappearance alters the structure of a neotropical vertebrate community with findings indicative of density compensation. White-lipped peccary were the most frequently detected terrestrial mammal in the 2006â2007 pre-population crash period but were undetected during the 2019 post-crash survey. Panthera onca (jaguar) camera trap encounter rates declined by 63% following the wlp crash, while collared peccary, puma (puma concolor), red-brocket deer (mazama americana) and short-eared dog (atelocynus microtis) all displayed greater encounter rates (490%, 150%, 280%, and 500% respectively), and increased in rank-abundance. Absence of wlp was correlated with ecological release changes in habitat-use for six species, with the greatest increase in use in the preferred floodplain habitat of the wlp. Surprisingly, community-weighted mean trait distributions (body size, feeding guild and nocturnality) did not change, suggesting functional redundancy in diverse tropical mammal assemblages.

101,2022,"Rural livelihoods, community-based conservation, and humanâwildlife conflict: scope for synergies?","Biological Conservation","Halting biodiversity loss is a major contemporary challenge. Nature protection can help conserve biodiversity, but increasing wildlife numbers inside protected areas and shrinking habitats intensify interactions between humans and wildlife, potentially causing humanâwildlife conflict (hwc). Contemporary narratives of hwc highlight detrimental effects on households' socioeconomic outcomes. Despite a wealth of literature on hwc, many studies remain descriptive and little inferential evidence has been provided. Here we identify the determinants and effects of reported hwc on household outcomes using spatial predictors and an original farm-household dataset collected in namibia's share of the kavango-zambezi transfrontier conservation area. In addition to dependence on agriculture, we find that community-based conservation, the share of a community's area set aside for conservation, and habitat connectivity are key drivers of hwc. Contrary to contemporary narratives of hwc, we find that reported conflicts did not have strong negative effects on household income and livelihood diversity. Conversely, community-based wildlife conservation increases income and livelihood diversity among participating households. It is, however, also associated with food insecurity concerns. Such concerns may be driven by comparatively higher restrictions related to land use planning and zoning that constrain productive land uses, such as agriculture. Our findings suggest that community-based conservation can create development synergies for households in favorable environments, despite increasing hwc risks. However, potential trade-offs including non-material costs warrant further research.

102,2022,"Genomic analyses show extremely perilous conservation status of african and asiatic cheetahs (acinonyx jubatus)","Molecular Ecology","We live in a world characterized by biodiversity loss and global environmental change. The extinction of large carnivores can have ramifying effects on ecosystems like an uncontrolled increase in wild herbivores, which in turn can have knock-on impacts on vegetation regeneration and communities. Cheetahs (acinonyx jubatus) serve important ecosystem functions as apex predators; yet, they are quickly heading towards an uncertain future. Threatened by habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict and illegal trafficking, there are only approximately 7100 individuals remaining in nature. We present the most comprehensive genome-wide analysis of cheetah phylogeography and conservation genomics to date, assembling samples from nearly the entire current and past species' range. We show that their phylogeography is more complex than previously thought, and that east african cheetahs (a. J. Raineyi) are genetically distinct from southern african individuals (a. J. Jubatus), warranting their recognition as a distinct subspecies. We found strong genetic differentiation between all classically recognized subspecies, thus refuting earlier findings that cheetahs show only little differentiation. The strongest differentiation was observed between the asiatic and all the african subspecies. We detected high inbreeding in the critically endangered iranian (a. J. Venaticus) and north-western (a. J. Hecki) subspecies, and show that overall cheetahs, along with snow leopards, have the lowest genome-wide heterozygosity of all the big cats. This further emphasizes the cheetah's perilous conservation status. Our results provide novel and important information on cheetah phylogeography that can support evidence-based conservation policy decisions to help protect this species. This is especially relevant in light of ongoing and proposed translocations across subspecies boundaries, and the increasing threats of illegal trafficking. Â© 2022 the authors.

103,2022,"Automated detection of gunshots in tropical forests using convolutional neural networks","Ecological Indicators","Unsustainable hunting is one of the leading drivers of global biodiversity loss, yet very few direct measures exist due to the difficulty in monitoring this cryptic activity. Where guns are commonly used for hunting, such as in the tropical forests of the americas and africa, acoustic detection can potentially provide a solution to this monitoring challenge. The emergence of low cost autonomous recording units (arus) brings into reach the ability to monitor hunting pressure over wide spatial and temporal scales. However, arus produce immense amounts of data, and long term and large-scale monitoring is not possible without efficient automated sound classification techniques. We tested the effectiveness of a sequential two-stage detection pipeline for detecting gunshots from acoustic data collected in the tropical forests of belize. The pipeline involved an on-board detection algorithm which was developed and tested in a prior study, followed by a spectrogram based convolutional neural network (cnn), which was developed in this manuscript. As gunshots are rare events, we focussed on developing a classification pipeline that maximises recall at the cost of increased false positives, with the aim of using the classifier to assist human annotation of files. We trained the cnn on annotated data collected across two study sites in belize, comprising 597 gunshots and 28,195 background sounds. Predictions from the annotated validation dataset comprising 150 gunshots and 7044 background sounds collected from the same sites yielded a recall of 0.95 and precision of 0.85. The combined recall of the two-step pipeline was estimated at 0.80. We subsequently applied the cnn to an un-annotated dataset of over 160,000 files collected in a spatially distinct study site to test for generalisability and precision under a more realistic monitoring scenario. Our model was able to generalise to this dataset, and classified gunshots with 0.57 precision and estimated 80% recall, producing a substantially more manageable dataset for human verification. Using a classifier-guided listening approach such as ours can make wide scale monitoring of threats such as hunting a feasible option for conservation management.

104,2022,"Non-native minnows cause much larger negative effects than trout on littoral macroinvertebrates of high mountain lakes","Biological Conservation","Despite being naturally fishless, the widespread introduction of trout and minnows is threatening the conservation of high mountain lakes all over the world. Previous studies have reported that amphibians quickly disappear after trout introduction, followed by many conspicuous invertebrates. Here, we have studied the effects of minnows versus trout on the littoral macroinvertebrate community of 54 high mountain lakes from the pyrenees, covering a gradient of environmental characteristics. The relative importance of fish compared to other variables in explaining macroinvertebrate communities was assessed using distance-based redundancy analysis (dbrda) and multivariate regression tree (mrt) to find the main environmental thresholds. Both dbrda and mrt approaches revealed that minnow density was the most important variable negatively determining community structure, followed by aquatic macrophytes, which increased taxa richness. The occurrence and abundance of relevant taxa was analysed in relation to fish densities and other environmental factors using binomial and gamma generalized linear models (glm). Glm suggested that trout had an impact on the distribution of swimmer taxa and caused declines in the abundance of conspicuous clinger and burrower taxa. Minnows restricted the occurrence of more taxa than trout and negatively affected a wide variety of body sizes and functional groups. Indeed, we found that minnows were responsible for a dramatic biodiversity loss in the littoral macroinvertebrate community. The fast spread of minnows in high mountain areas is of great concern for the conservation of lake macroinvertebrates. Urgent measures to stop minnow introductions are strongly recommended.

The acceleration of species and ecosystem decline coupled with climate change suggests that as it stands, nature cannot absorb the pressure humanity is placing on the planet. Bold new approaches to biodiversity conservation are needed. Promoting an engaged community is an important part of achieving conservation outcomes. Research shows that citizen science has the potential to elicit conservation engagement. However, research has not specifically explored how intensive citizen science expedition programs contribute to change. Here we use transformative learning theory as a tool to investigate how participation in citizen science programs influences conservation engagement. We analysed evaluation surveys of earthwatch institute citizen science participants (nâ =â 608) and conducted in-depth interviews (nâ =â 11), to examine the links between citizen science experiences and engagement outcomes. We discovered that while nature-based components of citizen science programs attract participants and create a salient environment for transformation, these are not objectively associated with engagement outcomes. Strengthened awareness was associated with learning, social interactions and cultural experiences, whereas intentions to engage in conservation action was only influenced by experiencing a sense of contribution. Rather than focusing only on learning and nature experiences, our results suggest that the elements of citizen science programs which support social change may require allowing participants to develop a sense of contribution amid an interactive social environment.","10.1002/pan3.10332","Scopus","Scopus_105",229,0.503762248219038,0.324950663149334,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
106,2022,"Cryptic population decrease due to invasive species predation in a long-lived seabird supports need for eradication","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Invasive species are one of the greatest drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide, and the eradication of invasive species from islands is a highly efficient management strategy. Because eradication operations require large financial investments, uncertainty over the magnitude of impacts of both invasive species and their removal can impede the willingness of decision makers to invest in eradication. Such uncertainty is prevalent for long-lived species that display an inherent lag between life stages affected by invasive species and those used for population status assessments. Albatrosses are amongst the longest-living bird species and are threatened on land by invasive species and at sea by industrial fisheries. As in many seabird species, usually only a segment of the population (breeding adults) is used for status assessments, making it difficult to assess albatross population trends and the potential benefit of conservation action, such as the management of predatory invasive species. We used population monitoring and mark-recapture data to estimate the past population trajectory of the critically endangered tristan albatross diomedea dabbenena by accounting for unobservable birds at sea in an integrated population model. We then projected the future population trajectory of tristan albatrosses for scenarios with or without predation by invasive house mice mus musculus on their main breeding site, gough island. The adult breeding population remained stable between 2004 and 2021, but breeding success was low (31%) and our model indicated that the total population (including unobservable immature birds) decreased from a median estimate of 9,795 to 7,752 birds. Eradicating invasive mice leading to a two-fold increase in breeding success would result in a 1.8â7.6 times higher albatross population by 2050 (median estimate 10,352 individuals) than without this intervention. Low reproductive output for long-lived species may lead to a cryptic population decrease, which can be obscured from readily available counts of breeding pairs by changes in the population structure. Mouse eradication is necessary to halt the ongoing population decrease of the tristan albatross, even if this decrease is not yet apparent in the breeding population size.

107,2022,"Home is where the heat is: thermoregulation of european bats inhabiting artificial roosts and the threat of heat waves","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Anthropogenic land use changes, such as deforestation and commercial forestry, have substantially reduced natural roost sites for european bats. A common conservation solution is to provide artificial roosts (i.e. Bat boxes), but there are concerns that these can become hotter than natural roosts in summer and could be death traps during heat waves. Nevertheless, females of several bat species form maternity colonies in these boxes, thus occupying hotter and more humid microclimates than solitarily roosting males. We tested if cooling efficiency and heat tolerance differ between sexes in european bats, and estimated the evaporative water requirements for bats living in bat boxes during hot summer days. We used indirect calorimetry and thermometry to quantify thermoregulation at high air temperatures (ta) in four species of verspitilionid bats that regularly occupy artificial roosts. We measured resting metabolic heat production, evaporative water loss rates (ewl) and body temperature (tb) at ta between 28â°c and 48â°c during summer. We predicted that females have higher evaporative cooling efficiency (evaporative heat loss/metabolic heat production) than males, allowing them to reach their heat tolerance limit at higher ta. We found no sex differences in maximum evaporative cooling efficiency, maximum tb, and maximum ta tolerated. However, the patterns of increasing ewl with ta differed between sexes. Females tolerated higher ta before increasing ewl than males and then rapidly increased ewl to higher values than males at the maximum ta tolerated. These sex differences in heat dissipation strategies may reflect varying ecological and physiological constraints associated with different summer roosting habits. Synthesis and applications. Our study revealed that some small european bat species are already at risk of succumbing to lethal dehydration during present-day heat waves, with daytime evaporative water requirements equivalent to ~30% of body mass in sun-exposed boxes. For conservation managers working with common european bat species, particularly those in monoculture forests with woodcrete bat-boxes, our physiologically informed recommendations include positioning boxes in diverse locations varying in aspect and sun exposure. This will ensure thermal heterogeneity of roost sites and provide a wide gradient of microclimate conditions, allowing for roost switching when necessary. Â© 2022 the authors.

108,2022,"Benthic megafauna habitats, community structure and environmental drivers at rio grande rise (sw atlantic)","Deep-Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers","The rio grande rise (rgr) is a large and geomorphologically complex feature located in the southwest atlantic, with great commercial and scientific interest due to its potential for mining rare earth elements that are critical for low-carbon technologies. Brazilian interest in this area led to the submission of a petition to the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf in 2018 to include rgr on the limits of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. However, mining activities are potentially harmful to deep-sea ecosystems and will likely cause some extent of biodiversity loss. Thus, baseline and continuous environmental studies in the rgr are important to address potential conflicts between mineral extraction and the conservation of deep-sea biodiversity. The rgr is characterized by a series of summit plateaus of â¼600 m deep divided ne-sw by a rift valley, up to 2000 m deep. In 2018, the plateaus and rift of a small area in rgr (30â°35â²s â 31â°03â²s, 35â°36â²w â 36â°16â²w) were explored through 13 dives of the robotic underwater vehicle (ruv) hybis. Videos were analyzed for the description of structuring factors (topography and habitat types) and to record benthic megafauna occurrences. Video transects revealed highly heterogeneous and rapidly changing habitats. Eleven habitats, five in the rift and six in the plateaus are proposed based on geomorphology, slope, and substrate textures. We recorded 17,008 megabenthic organisms classified in 83 morphotypes and six different phyla, from which porifera (42.7%) and cnidaria (41.5%) were the most representative. Samples were characterized by a high dominance and the dissimilarities result chiefly from differences in abundance scores. Permanova tests indicated that habitat and region variables were the most important to explain structure within the community data, followed by depth and slope. The rift floor exhibited a low abundance of megabenthic epifauna, except in a sinkhole in the northern part of the rift. The lower and upper rift wall were characterized by different communities delimited by the transition between the antarctic intermediate water and the upper circumpolar deep water. The habitats formed by feâmn deposits were dominated by distinct communities, which were rarely observed elsewhere. Additionally, we found variations in community structure at regional scales (20â30 km), with distinct communities on each side of the rift and at the southwest of the study area. Our results contribute toward understanding the diversity, biogeography, and environmental drivers of the rgr. Fauna distribution is patchy, linked to habitats with potential mining resources, and dominated by vulnerable marine ecosystems (vmes) indicator taxa.

Methods: at each station, we calculated taxonomic and functional diversity indices, and examined their association with ecosystem functioning based on the biomass index. Moreover, we examined the biomass index's association with two environmental variables, sea bottom temperature and sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration, to investigate the relative importance of the environmental conditions in explaining changes in ecosystem functioning. Results: two taxonomic diversity indices (species richness and variance) and two functional diversity indices (functional richness and functional evenness) were significantly associated with biomass in at least one season. However, the bef relationships were not consistent among the seasons, highlighting the need to consider season-specific biodiversity indices (e.g., functional evenness). Specifically, despite consistently significant bef relationships in the four seasons for species richness, variance, and functional richness, we noted temporally variable bef relationships for functional evenness. Both the environment and biodiversity produced a strong synergistic effect on biomass, although their relative importance varied among seasons. Main conclusions: biodiversity greatly contributes to ecosystem functioning, underscoring the need to assess the consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystems using integrated taxonomic and trait-based approaches. Our findings on season-dependent bef relationships provide evidence for considering seasonal factors before applying bef relationships to ecosystem-based management, at least in overexploited shelf sea ecosystems.

110,2022,"Exploring multiple dimensions of conservation success: long-term wildlife trends, anti-poaching efforts and revenue sharing in kibale national park, uganda","Animal Conservation","Parks are essential for protecting biodiversity and finding ways to improve park effectiveness is an important topic. We contributed to this debate by examining spatial and temporal changes in illegal activities in kibale national park, uganda between 2006 and 2016 and used existing data to evaluate how the changes were correlated with the living conditions of people in neighboring communities, as well as patrolling effort. We explore the effectiveness of conservation strategies implemented in kibale, by quantifying changes in the abundance of nine animal species over two to five decades. While uncertainty in such animal survey data are inherently large and it is hard to generalize across a 795-km2 area that encompasses diverse habitat types, data suggest an increase in animal abundance in the national park. An increase in patrolling effort by park guards over the decade was correlated with a decline in the number of traps and snares found, which suggests patrolling helped limit resource extraction from the park. The parkâs edge was extensively used for illegal forest product extraction, while the setting of snares occurred more often deeper in the forest. Perhaps counter-intuitively, increased community wealth or park-related employment in a village next to the park were positively correlated with increased illegal forest product extraction. Overall, our results suggest that the portfolio of conservation strategies used over the last two to five decades were effective for protecting the park and its animals, although understanding the impact of these efforts on local human populations and how to mitigate any losses and suffering they sustain remains an important area of research and action. It is evident that complex social, political and economic drivers impact conservation success and more interdisciplinary studies are required to quantify and qualify these dimensions.

111,2022,"Life with big cats: local perceptions of big cat species","Animal Conservation","Land use change, agricultural and urban expansion, and anthropogenic climate change are the major drivers of biodiversity loss across the globe. Big cats (a casual term including species such as tigers, lions, mountain lions, jaguars, leopards, snow leopards, and cheetahs) are impacted by these global changes. As human settlement and activity increasingly overlap with big cat habitat, the frequency of human conflict over wildlife is rising, often precipitating direct costs to people living near big cats. Big cats are rare, they play many critical roles in the ecosystems they inhabit, and are often flagship conservation species because they are poster-charismatic megafauna. As many of the costs of conservation are borne by locals, local acceptance of big cats on the landscape is fundamental to the success of in-situ conservation of these species. Here, we explore this issue by conducting a systematic literature review of articles that directly measure local perceptions (or acceptance) of big cats quantitatively. We normalized all perception data so we could synthesize results across places and species. The final set of data included the views of 14 253 locals from 45 papers, interrogating five different question types on local perceptions of big cats. Across these studies, we found that locals generally hold neutral or slightly positive perceptions of big cats â particularly for tigers and mountain lions. On average, livestock owners have more negative perceptions of big cats compared to non-livestock owners. Geographically, there are large portions of big cat population ranges where no research on local perceptions exist. These results call for two things (1) rethinking the perception that locals largely hold negative views toward big cats across their ranges and (2) more systematic research across big cat species ranges to better understand local perceptions, what drives those perceptions, and how they impact the outcomes of conservation approaches.

112,2022,"Mapping hydrologic alteration and ecological consequences in stream reaches of the conterminous united states","Scientific Data","Environmental flows are critical for balancing societal water needs with that of riverine ecosystems; however, data limitations often hinder the development of predictive relationships between anthropogenic modifications to streamflow regimes and ecological responses - these relationships are the basis for setting regional water policy standards for rivers. Herein, we present and describe a comprehensive dataset of modeled hydrologic alteration and consequences for native fish biodiversity, both mapped at the stream-reach resolution for the conterminous u.s. Using empirical observations of reference conditions and anthropogenically altered streamflow at over 7000 stream gauges, we developed a predictive model of hydrologic alteration, which was extended to >2.6 million stream reaches. We then used a previous nationwide assessment of ecological responses to hydrologic alteration to predict fish biodiversity loss in stream reaches resulting from streamflow modification. Validation efforts suggested hydrologic alteration models had satisfactory performance, whereas modeled ecological responses were susceptible to compounded errors. The dataset could ameliorate regional data deficits for setting environmental flow standards while providing tools for prioritizing streamflow protection or restoration. Â© 2022.

113,2022,"Impacts of brush pile fishing on fish biodiversity: a case study of the shari-goyain river in bangladesh","Heliyon","Brush pile (katha), a fish aggregating device, has been widely used in the shari-goyain river since 2003 to congregate fish for easier catch. Katha is usually used during the winter season when the water depth decreases. Hence, this experiment was conducted from november 2018 to march 2019 on katha fishing to investigate its status and impacts on fisheries resources of the shari-goyain river in the sylhet district of bangladesh. The study was based on the hypothesis that katha fishing might have detrimental impacts to fish biodiversity and production. Data were obtained through a questionnaire-based survey, personal interviews, catch assessment (ca), focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. A total of 54 species were documented, including two exotic fish species (tilapia and common carp) and 3 species of prawn during harvesting of the kathas. The catch per unit effort (cpue) (kg/gear/ha/person/hour) was the highest in december (1.13 â± 0.37), followed by november (1.06 â± 0.40), january (0.80 â± 0.25), february (0.71 â± 0.23), and march (0.52 â± 0.21). The catch per unit area (cpua) (kg/ha) was the highest in november (264.66 â± 18.21), followed by december (205.05 â± 27.77), january (175.02 â± 76.04), february (147.73 â± 52.11), and march (102.08 â± 41.04) where significant differences (p < 0.05) among the months were observed. Average catch per katha in a month ranged from 41.09 â± 16.11 to 12.42 â± 5.89 kg, with a mean of 24.29 â± 11.08 kg, and a significant decrease in average catch was observed with the progression of months. The most species richness was noticed in december (38), followed by november (35), january (34), february (28), and march (25). Siluriformes (39.123%) was the most dominant order, followed by cypriniformes (33.956%), decapoda (14.661%), and ovalentaria (3.278%). According to the ca and respondentsâ perception, indiscriminate harvesting of fish by katha fishing can be a cause of fish biodiversity loss as it reduces open water catches, total production, and disturbs the ecosystem. From the research findings, it is suggested that katha fishing should be stopped for sustainable management and conservation of fisheries resources in the shari-goyain river. Research on the effects of katha fishing should be conducted in other open waters of bangladesh where this type of fishing is common.

114,2022,"Ecological and hydrological indicators of climate change observed by dryland communities of malipati in chiredzi, zimbabwe","Diversity","Existing evidence about climate change in zimbabwe has tended to focus more on elements and events of the climate system, marginalizing changes in the hydrological and ecological system. To contribute to the improved understanding of climate change, this study captured the observations of climate change in malipati, a remote agrarian dryland area in the chiredzi district, zimbabwe. The aim of the study was to gather detailed insights about perceived environmental changes using the evidence drawn from local and indigenous populations who have close interactions with their natural environment. A household questionnaire-based survey with randomly chosen farmers (n = 116) revealed that participantsâ observations of changes in hydrological and ecological system were consistent with available evidence of increasing temperatures and little rainfall recorded in the district. Results also showed high sensitivity of the area to climate change that manifest in various indicators: hydrological changes in rivers, streams, swamps, and ground water; and ecological changes through the behaviour of trees, insects, birds, and wild animals. Sex and age of the participants did not influence the way they perceived most of these changes (p > 0.05). However, education and the period of stay in the area were related to the respondentsâ perceived changes in river flows and siltation, and the conditions of swamps (p < 0.05). Our study also revealed deeper insights about the human-biodiversity interactions in the face of climate change in unique areas where communities live alongside wildlife. The evidence drawn from local and indigenous populations can be used to inform local-based solutions to the growing problems of climate change and biodiversity loss. Future studies would need to further examine such areas to understand the mitigation and adaptation practices that would promote the sustainable co-existence of humans and wildlife.

115,2022,"Methodology for identifying ecological corridors: a spatial planning perspective","Land","Recent studies carried out by landscape and urban ecologists have shown that habitat fragmentation has negative environmental effects and is accountable for the loss of biodiversity. The development and extension of road infrastructure to support economic growth, the urbanization and the land-use changes are major drivers of habitat fragmentation. Planners have attempted to develop tools for restoring connectivity and stopping biodiversity loss at the landscape scale and which can be applied at the urban scale, too. The study fills in the gap by developing a methodology for identifying the ecological corridors of a romanian large carnivore (brown bear) in the romanian carpathian mountains at several spatial scales. The methodology relies on geospatial data; this is equally its most important advantage and challenge. Our findings suggest that the implementation of ecological corridors in current planning practice must be completed cautiously, provided the possible restrictions are imposed on economic activities by plans, and highlight the importance of field data in increasing the scientific soundness of the results. In addition, the findings show the need to interconnect spatial planning policies with environmental policies by improving the actual legislation. Â© 2022 by the authors.

116,2022,"Fluctuating asymmetry and oxidative stress indicate environmental stress of cane toads rhinella marina","Zoologischer Anzeiger","Landfills led to biodiversity loss and have been identified as one of the major threats to wildlife, such as amphibians. There are useful tools that reflect environmental stress and help to monitor populations health before irreversible population decline occurs. Fluctuating asymmetry and oxidative stress have been used to analyze stress in wildlife. We analyzed the fluctuating asymmetry of morphological traits and the oxidative stress in the toad rhinella marina that occur in contrasting habitats: a temperate forest and a landfill. We found higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry in toads of the landfill compared to individuals from the forest. Toads from the landfill also had higher levels of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity than toads from the forest, meanwhile lipid peroxidation was similar between toad's populations. Higher fluctuating asymmetry suggests higher environmental stress in toads from the landfill. We highlight that although cane toads have been described as an invasive species of anthropized environments, our findings confirm an increase in the levels of environmental stress in landfills.

117,2022,"Effects of forest fragmentation on the weight of understory birds at the biological dynamics of forest fragments project in amazonia","Biotropica","Deforestation and habitat fragmentation are known as the chief drivers of biodiversity loss. Less is known about the condition of species and individuals that remain in disturbed habitats. Theory predicts that resources are more limited after compared with before fragment isolation. Thus, we assessed how body condition of individual birds' changes in response to forest fragment isolation. We compared weights of the same individually banded birds caught in mist nets within 5 years before and after fragment isolation and assessed the population-level changes of three species at the biological dynamics of forest fragments project in the brazilian amazon. We predicted that fragment isolation would result in reduced weight for all bird species. Out of the 3466 bird mist net captures before and after isolation in the 1980s and the 2150 birds captured before and after re-isolation of fragments in the 2010s, only 73 adult individuals from 36 different species were recaptured, suggesting that few individuals stay in fragments. Contrary to predictions, insectivorous species that remained in fragments gained weight (3.43%) after fragment isolation while frugivorous birds maintained a stable weight. While recent studies report long-term declines in body mass of birds in tropical unfragmented tropical forests, our results provide a novel analysis into how avian body mass responds to habitat fragmentation. Further studies on the body condition of individuals that remain in fragments and the ultimate consequences of fluctuations in body condition are needed to better understand why some individuals and species are more susceptible to forest fragmentation than others.

118,2022,"Economic incentives for the wildlife trade and costs of epidemics compared across individual, national, and global scales","Conservation Science And Practice","The wildlife trade drives biodiversity loss and zoonotic disease emergence, and the health and economic impacts of covid-19 have sparked discussions over stricter regulation of the wildlife trade. Yet regulation for conservation and health purposes is at odds with the economic incentives provided by this multibillion-dollar industry. To understand why the wildlife trade persists despite associated biodiversity and global health threats, we used a benefitâcost approach using simple calculations to compare the economic benefits of the wildlife trade at the individual, national, and global scales to the costs of covid-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), and ebola disease across scenarios of epidemic frequency. For covid-19, benefits of the wildlife trade outweigh costs at individual scales, but costs far exceed benefits at national and global scales, particularly if epidemics were to become frequent. For sars and ebola, benefits outweigh costs at all scales, except if ebola-like epidemics were to become frequent. The wildlife trade produces net benefits for people who depend on wildlife for food and income but incurs net costs on stakeholders at larger scales from increased epidemic risk. While our analysis omits a variety of costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify and contrast, our analysis is meant to illustrate the distributional outcomes across stakeholder groups that could result from increased wildlife trade regulation. Importantly, the feasibility of trade regulatory policies will depend on how these benefits and costs compare across groups and would therefore need to involve accessible and attractive alternative sources of food and livelihoods for those who depend on the wildlife trade.

119,2022,"Restoration of a declining foundation plant species: testing the roles of competitor suppression, fire reintroduction and herbivore exclusion","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Maintaining ecosystem processes within patches of remnant vegetation is critical to minimising biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes. Foundation speciesâhabitat-forming organisms that interact with many other speciesâare therefore a priority for conservation and restoration in farming areas. Triodia spp. Grasses are foundation species of arid and semi-arid australia that largely depend on fire for recruitment, but fire is suppressed or excluded in many agricultural areas. We tested the effectiveness of controlled burns and competitor removal (exotic and native grasses), both in isolation and combined, on recruitment rates of triodia scariosa in remnant vegetation using a before-after, control-impact study across 126 plots. A subset of plots were located in an herbivore exclusion area inside a reserve. There was no recruitment of t. Scariosa 1 year after burning, regardless of treatment or control, and the burns killed all existing plants. However, t. Scariosa germinated by 2 years post-burn, with the greatest recruitment in sites where both burning and grass removal were applied. Two years after burning, t. Scariosa abundance (adults and recruits) remained low outside reserves, but returned to original levels in reserves and in areas where large herbivores were excluded. Synthesis and applications. Despite failing to increase overall abundance, we show that restoration of a foundation plant species in degraded, agricultural landscapes can be achieved through a combination of fire reintroduction and competitor suppression. Germination trials from soil samples suggest a depleted seed bank limited recruitment rates, and therefore emphasise the importance of carefully timing restoration actions to overcome recruitment bottlenecks.

Great plains","Ecological Economics","Although declines in grassland birds have been documented, national initiatives to conserve grasslands and their biota have fallen short in part because the non-market values of natural ecosystems and species are often not recognized in political decision making. Identifying shared, anthropogenic threats faced by market-valued and non-market-valued species may generate additional support for grassland conservation. We quantify the relationship between the market value of grasslands to commercial beekeepers and the importance of grasslands for birds of conservation concern in north and south dakota. Our models estimated beekeeping annual revenue increased by $7525 usd and grassland bird abundances increased 2 to 7% per 10-km2 increase in grassland area. We estimated grassland conversion from 2006 to 2012 resulted in a $2.0 to $2.8 m usd decrease in annual revenue for beekeepers in the dakotas. Through this study we demonstrate both the market value of grasslands to commercial beekeepers and the non-market benefits of grasslands in supporting migratory birds and discuss the implications of future land-use change. As grassland conversion and subsequent biodiversity loss continue, understanding the co-benefits of grassland conservation may be necessary to illuminate their contributions to society.

121,2022,"Disentangling the components of coastal fish biodiversity in southern brittany by applying an environmental dna approach","Environmental Dna","The global biodiversity crisis from anthropogenic activities significantly weakens the functioning of marine ecosystems and jeopardizes their ecosystem services. Increasing monitoring of marine ecosystems is crucial to understand the breadth of the changes in biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and propose more effective conservation strategies. Such strategies should not only focus on maximizing the number of species (i.e., taxonomic diversity) but also the diversity of phylogenetic histories and ecological functions within communities. To support future conservation decisions, multicomponent biodiversity monitoring can be combined with high-throughput species assemblage detection methods such as environmental dna (edna) metabarcoding. Here, we used edna to assess fish biodiversity along the coast of southern brittany (france, iroise sea). We filtered surface marine water from 17 sampling stations and applied an edna metabarcoding approach targeting actinopterygii and elasmobranchii taxa. We documented three complementary biodiversity componentsâtaxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversityâand three diversity facetsârichness, divergence and regularity. We identified a north/south contrast with higher diversity for the three facets of the biodiversity components in the northern part of the study area. The northern communities showed higher species richness, stronger phylogenetic overdispersion and lower functional clustering compared to the ones in the southern part, due to the higher diversity of habitats (reefs, rocky shores) and restricted access for fishing. Moreover, we also detected a higher level of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional uniqueness in many offshore stations compared to more coastal ones, with the presence of species typically living at greater depths (> 300 m), which suggests an influence of hydrodynamic structures and currents on edna dispersion and hence sample composition. Edna metabarcoding can, therefore, be used as an efficient sampling method to reveal fine-scale community compositions and in combination with functional and phylogenetic information to document multicomponent biodiversity gradients in coastal marine systems.

We tested whether bd prevalence is distributed among host taxonomy, ecoregion, conservation status and habitat preference in south america. Here we provide a synthesis on the extent of bd infection across south america based on 21 648 molecular diagnostic assays, roles of certain species in the epidemiology of bd and explore its association with the reported amphibian catastrophic declines in the region. We show that bd is widespread, with a continental prevalence of 23.2%. Its occurrence in the region shows a phylogenetic signal and the probability of infection is determined by ecoregion, preferred habitat and extinction risk hosts' traits. The taxa exhibiting highest bd occurrence were mostly aquatic amphibians, including ranidae, telmatobiidae, hylodidae, calyptocephalellidae and pipidae. Surprisingly, families exhibiting unusually low bd prevalence included species in which lethal chytridiomycosis and population declines have been described (genera atelopus, rhinoderma and eleutherodactylus). Higher than expected prevalence of bd occurred mainly in amphibians living in association with mountain environments in the andes and atlantic forests, reflecting highly favourable bd habitats in these areas. Invasive amphibian species (e.g. Lithobates catesbeianus and xenopus laevis) exhibited high bd prevalence; thus we suggest using these as sentinels to understand their potential role as reservoirs, vectors or spreaders of bd that can be subjected to management.

123,2022,"Explaining declines of newt abundance in northern italy","Freshwater Biology","Amphibians are an exemplary case of the current biodiversity crisis, being among the vertebrates suffering the fastest decline. Population dynamics of amphibians can result from processes acting at different scales. Both the local characteristics of breeding wetlands and the features of the surrounding landscape can strongly affect the temporal dynamics of amphibian populations. European newts are particularly threatened by land-use change and invasive alien species. While it is known that newts are declining across europe, few studies have performed broad-scale assessments of their decline, either because abundance dynamics are more complex to analyse than presence/absence data or because they require a high sampling effort and long-term monitoring. In this study, we show that long-term distribution data can be combined with demographic models to quantify the decline in abundance of newt species at the regional scale, and to assess the importance of multiple factors in determining abundance dynamics. We performed multiple surveys between 1996 and 2020 and used n-mixture models in a bayesian framework. We then calculated abundance changes between the first and the last sampling season, which were performed with an average timespan of 13â years across all wetlands. Both italian crested newts and smooth newts showed large declines, with an average estimated abundance loss between the first and last sampling season of 57% and 63%, respectively. Local characteristics of the wetlands were the main determinants of abundance dynamics: the abundance of both species showed a positive relationship with the area and the permanence of the wetland and a negative relationship with the presence of fish. Additionally, the abundance of italian crested newts was negatively related to the presence of invasive crayfish. No relationship was detected between abundance and terrestrial habitat availability or connectivity measures. Despite uncertainties in the absolute values of estimated abundance, the striking regional-scale decline of newts is evident. Among the major determinants of population dynamics, fish and crayfish presence increased their prevalence in the study area, while other factors remained more stable. Management actions aimed at eradicating or controlling invasive fish and crayfish might halt abundance loss and even revert this declining trend. The application of n-mixture models to long-term data from representative sites permits the analysis of temporal trends of species at the regional scale even when data come from complex monitoring schemes. We found large declines in abundance of two newt species, suggesting that european newts may be more threatened than previously thought. Â© 2022 the authors.

In the old world, and particularly in africa, illegal use of poisons to eliminate carnivores is the main driver of the continental vulture crisis. Knowledge about the underlying source and drivers of this threat is lacking for most areas, including kenya, a global vulture and biodiversity hotspot. An extensive questionnaire survey of over 1300 respondents was run, using a specialized questioning technique and quantitative analytical approaches. Results show that, while pastoralists have a positive attitude towards vultures, over 20% of them use poisons to eliminate predators. Poisoning was largely driven by livestock losses to predators, and by negative attitude towards predators. Poisoning was less prevalent among respondents aware of the kenya wildlife act. Overall, we suggest that a combination of top-down, e.g. Legislation, and bottom-up (such as corrals or compensation) along with awareness campaigns may help reduce poisoning on the ground.

This study examined the avoidance responses of tadpoles of the african common toad, amietophrynus regularis, exposed to dichlorvos and paraquat under a non-forced multi-compartmented exposure system (nfs) and estimated the population immediate decline (pid) by integrating avoidance and lethal responses. The nfs was designed to allow the free movement of tadpoles across six compartments in order to elucidate the ability of aquatic organisms to detect and potentially avoid contaminated environments at will. The tadpoles (n=3 per compartment/concentration; 18 per system) were exposed to gradients of dichlorvos (0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/l) and paraquat (0, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 mg/l) in quadruplicates with their distribution recorded every 20 mins for 3 h. 48 h acute toxicity tests under forced exposure system (fs) was performed using the same range of concentrations.

The mean percentage distribution of tadpoles recorded for dichlorvos and paraquat was about 11% and 0% in the highest concentrations (2.0 and 20.0 mg/l) to 58% and 69% in compartments with no contaminants (control), respectively. Pid was primarily driven by avoidance responses rather than mortality. These findings are of conservation interest as it elucidates the potential of both pesticides to impair local distribution of amphibians and cause biodiversity loss.

126,2022,"Dam construction impacts fish biodiversity in a subtropical river network, china","Diversity","Dams and diversions are a primary threat to freshwater fish biodiversity, including the loss of species and restructuring of communities, often resulting in taxonomic homogenization (increased similarity) over time. Mitigating these impacts requires a strong scientific understanding of both patterns and drivers of fish diversity. Here, we test whether different components of fish biodiversity have changed in response to major dam construction, and whether these patterns are predictable as a function of key environmental factors in the gan river basin, china. The results showed that total and native species alpha diversity have declined from the historical period (pre-dam) to the current period (post-dam). A total of 29 native species are lost, while 6 alien species were gained over time. We found evidence for fish faunal homogenization in the gan river basin, with a slight (1%) increase in taxonomic similarity among river basins from the historical period to the current period. Additionally, we revealed significant associations between drainage length, drainage area, and average air temperature, and alpha and beta fish diversity. This study provides new insight into the patterns and drivers of fish biodiversity change in the broader yangtze river basin and helps inform management efforts seeking to slow, and even reverse, current trajectories of biodiversity change.

127,2022,"Are protected areas working for endangered frogs in the peruvian andes?","Biodiversity And Conservation","Assessments of the performance of protected-area (pa) networks for aquatic biodiversity conservation are rare yet essential for successful conservation of species. This is especially crucial in highly biodiverse, developing tropical countries where biodiversity loss is most pronounced. We assessed a pa network in the central andes of peru that encompasses parts of the geographical distribution of two endangered, endemic, high-elevation telmatobius frogs. Sites within and beyond pa boundaries were classified into three different pa types: (a) strict-use (prohibits use by local inhabitants), (b) multi-use (allows some use by local inhabitants), and (c) unprotected (no restrictions). We conducted spatial analysis of species distributions, quantified species abundances and population trends, and measured potential threats and ecological integrity in each pa type. Spatial analysis indicated range contractions of 57.7% (t. Macrostomus) and 69.0% (t. Brachydactylus). Defaunation rates and species abundances in pas were similar to those outside pas. Poaching, livestock, and solid waste were the predominant threats. Analysis of ecological integrity indicated that strict-use sites had greater biotic index and habitat assessment scores compared to multi-use sites. These results suggest that despite benefits of greater ecological integrity in strict-use pas, protection type has little effect on the conservation of aquatic species by itself. Protected areas are unlikely to be effective without better management of the trade-offs between cultural activities and biodiversity conservation. For pa networks to be of better conservation value for aquatic biodiversity in the developing world, they should be community-oriented and connect high-quality habitats, with their borders defined by catchments.

Such small-sized green areas can be essential components of green infrastructure to compensate for biodiversity loss. As a proxy to biodiversity, we studied birds in nine small green area locations of freiburg and eight area locations in regensburg in germany. We investigated the neighboring green networks (distance to the nearest water body and another green area) and landscape metrics (patch abundance and habitat heterogeneity at a 1 km radius) that might benefit and explain bird richness and composition in small green areas. We found that the variations in the observed species richness and composition at the surveyed locations were better explained solely by green networks in freiburg and by green networks and landscape metrics in regensburg. In general, it indicates that a small green area could be biodiverse if its spatial distribution considers a nearby water body and other green areas, allowing a higher abundance of similar patches and habitat heterogeneity in the neighborhood.

Using social media platform (twitter) to gauge the public awareness about wildlife conservation: a case study of the illegal rhino trade","International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health","The illegal wildlife trade is resulting in worldwide biodiversity loss and speciesâ extinction. It should be exposed so that the problems of conservation caused by it can be highlighted and resolutions can be found. Social media is an effective method of information dissemination, providing a real-time, low-cost, and convenient platform for the public to release opinions on wildlife protection. This paper aims to explore the usage of social media in understanding public opinions toward conservation events, and illegal rhino trade is an example. This paper provides a framework for analyzing rhino protection issues by using twitter. A total of 83,479 useful tweets and 33,336 pieces of usersâ information were finally restored in our database after filtering out irrelevant tweets. With 2422 records of trade cases, this study builds up a rhino trade network based on social media data. The research shows important findings: (1) tweeting behaviors are somewhat affected by the information of traditional mass media. (2) in general, countries and regions with strong negative sentiment tend to have high volume of rhino trade cases, but not all. (3) social celebritiesâ participation in activities arouses wide public concern, but the influence does not last for more than a month. Ngos, gos, media, and individual enterprises are dominant in the dissemination of information about rhino trade. This study contributes in the following ways: first, this paper conducts research on public opinions toward wildlife conservation using natural language processing technique. Second, this paper offers advice to governments and conservationist organizations, helping them utilize social media for protecting wildlife. Â© 2022 by the authors.

130,2022,"Dramatic decline of two freshwater killifishes, main anthropogenic drivers and appropriate conservation actions","Journal For Nature Conservation","Freshwater fish biodiversity loss in the mediterranean basin is regarded as among the highest globally, with long-term population data sets required to discern long-term population trends of threatened species, in order to design appropriate conservation interventions. In this study, we assessed the population trends of two threatened freshwater fishes, valencia letourneuxi and valencia robertae, employing the most recent and largest compiled database to date (16 populations over 14 years). We applied the innovative methodology of the living planet index (lpi) to assess the average rate of change over time across a set of v. Letourneuxi and v. Robertae populations in greece. The lpi application revealed a dramatic decline of both species, with v. Letourneuxi declining by 97.7% and v. Robertae by 91.0%. Beta regression showed that water pollution, eutrophication and alien eastern mosquitofish gambusia holbrookiâ presence were the three best fitting predictors of the decline of v. Letourneuxi and v. Robertae populations. Based on the above, we outline the conservation measures urgently required to revert the near collapse of the populations of the two species. Conservation actions include the strict protection of the their lowland spring habitats, habitat improvement through changes in water management and agricultural practices, mosquitofish invasion prevention and mosquitofish impact mitigation measures, as well as translocation actions and captive breeding. Lastly, the association patterns of the proposed conservation actions with anthropogenic pressures and their expected outcomes were analysed through an alluvial diagram, providing insights on the scale of pressures mitigated by conservation actions and on their conservation benefits.

131,2022,"Predicting the distribution of australian frogs and their overlap with batrachochytrium dendrobatidis under climate change","Diversity And Distributions","Aim: amphibians, with over 40% of assessed species listed as threatened, are disproportionately at risk in the global extinction crisis. Among the many factors implicated in the ongoing loss of amphibian biodiversity are climate change and the disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd). These threats are of particular concern in australia, where bd has been implicated in the declines of at least 43 frog species, and climate change is emerging as an additional threat. We explore how climate change is likely to affect the distributions of australian frog species and bd to the year 2100, and how the spatial and climatic niche overlap between chytridiomycosis-declined frogs and bd could shift. Location: australia. Methods: we used species distribution modelling to infer the current and future distribution of 141 australian frog species and bd, under two emissions scenarios. We used various metrics of niche similarity to quantify predicted alterations to spatial interactions between bd and frog species. Results: climate change is likely to have a variable impact on frog distributions in australia, with some 23 and 47 species, primarily in southern australia, predicted to lose at least 30% of their current distributions under low and high emissions scenarios, respectively. In contrast, 69 and 68 species, respectively, have potential to increase their distributions, primarily in northern australia. While the distribution of bd is predicted to decrease, the proportional spatial and niche overlap between bd and susceptible frog species is predicted to remain little changed, and in some cases, to increase. Main conclusions: although effects will be variable across the continent, climate change is likely to be a threatening factor to many australian frog species. Additionally, chytridiomycosis is likely to remain a significant threat to many frog species, as any reductions to the pathogen's distribution largely coincide with geographic range contractions of chytridiomycosis-susceptible species.

Birds contribute to biodiversity in several ways; one way, in particular, is by cultivating public support for habitat conservation by being a socially desirable category of wildlife. To understand the social value of bird conservation on private forest lands in pennsylvania, a statewide web survey was used containing psychometric scales and choice experiment questions (n = 690). The data collected was used to identify important attitudinal positions and estimate statewide demand for bird conservation programs on private lands under different policy options. Mean household wtp was estimated to be $11.83 annually, and statewide demand was estimated to exceed $47 million annually. Nonuse and cultural values underpinned much of the utility associated with the proposed habitat conservation programs. Findings suggest investment in both public education and bird conservation on private lands is a legitimate strategy for mitigating biodiversity loss and enhancing social welfare.

But removing them is further complicated when invasions occur in continental, mixed-ownership systems. We demonstrate a rare conservation success: the regional-scale removal of an invasive predator â the barred owl (strix varia) â to benefit the spotted owl (strix occidentalis) in california. Barred owl site occupancy declined sixfold, from 0.19 to 0.03, following 1 year of removals, and site extinction (0.92) far exceeded colonization (0.02). Spotted owls recolonized 56% of formerly occupied territories within 1 year, contrasting starkly with removals conducted after barred owls achieved high densities in the pacific northwest. Our study therefore averted the otherwise likely extirpation of california spotted owls (strix occidentalis occidentalis) by barred owl competition. Collectively, leveraging technological advances in population monitoring, early intervention, targeting defensible biogeographic areas, and fostering publicâprivate partnerships will reduce invasive species-driven extinction of native fauna in continental systems.

134,2022,"Effects of forest cover on richness of threatened fish species in japan","Conservation Biology","Estuariesââone of the most vulnerable ecosystems globallyââface anthropogenic threats, including biodiversity loss and the collapse of sustainable fisheries. Determining the factors contributing to the maintenance of estuarine biodiversity, especially that of fish, is vital for promoting estuarine conservation and sustainability. We used environmental dna metabarcoding analysis to determine fish species composition in 22 estuaries around japan and measured watershed-scale land-use factors (e.g., population size, urban area percentage, and forest area percentage). We sought to test the hypothesis that the richness of the most vulnerable estuarine fish species (i.e., registered by the japanese ministry of the environment in the national species red-list) is determined by watershed-scale land-use factors. The richness of such species was greater, where forest cover was highest; thus, forest cover contributes to their conservation. The proportion of agriculture cover was associated with low species richness of red-listed fishes (redundancy analysis, adjusted r2 = 43.9% of total variance, df = 5, f = 5.3843, p = 0.0001). The number of red-listed species increased from 3 to 11 along a watershed land-use gradient ranging from a high proportion of agriculture cover to a large proportion of forest cover. Furthermore, the results showed that throughout japan all the examined watersheds that were covered by >74.8% forest had more than the average (6.7 species per site) richness of red-listed fish species. This result can be attributed to the already high average forest cover in japan of 67.2%. Our results demonstrate how the land use of watersheds can affect the coastal sea environment and its biodiversity and suggest that proper forest management in conjunction with land-use management may be of prime importance for threatened fish species and coastal ecosystems in general.

135,2022,"Unravelling fish community assembly in shallow lakes: insights from functional and phylogenetic diversity","Reviews In Fish Biology And Fisheries","Global biodiversity loss has increased interest in identifying the patterns and mechanisms that shape community assembly. Growing empirical evidence indicates that investigating functional and phylogenetic diversity beyond purely taxonomic considerations may provide different but complementary information about community assembly. However, such multifaceted studies on community assembly from both functional and phylogenetic perspectives are rare in the context of fish assemblages in lakes. We examined patterns of functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity in fishes and explored the relationships between these patterns and their environmental drivers across broad environmental gradients in 30 shallow lakes. Furthermore, we examined community assembly mechanisms using null models to quantify the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic assembly processes. Our results revealed no clear patterns among multiple biodiversity components and their environmental drivers, and no single component could be used as a reliable proxy for another; these results suggest that accounting for functional and phylogenetic diversity can help to explain fish community variation. Null models revealed that both deterministic and stochastic assembly processes occurred simultaneously, with stochastic processes being responsible for the majority of fish community assembly processes in most of our study lakes. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of evaluating both functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity when identifying patterns of community assembly.

136,2022,"Intermediate levels of wood extraction may facilitate coexistence of an endemic arboreal marsupial and indigenous communities","Oryx","Land-use change is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Large-scale disturbances such as habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation are known to have negative consequences for native biota, but the effects of small-scale disturbances such as selective logging are less well known. We compared three sites with different regimes of selective logging performed by indigenous communities in the south american temperate rainforest, to assess effects on the density and habitat selection patterns of the near threatened endemic arboreal marsupial dromiciops gliroides. We used structured interviews to identify patterns of wood extraction, which was 0.22-2.55 m3 per ha per year. In the less disturbed site only two tree species were logged, in the intermediately disturbed sites eight species were logged at low intensity, and in the most disturbed site seven species were logged intensively. The site with intermediate disturbance had the highest fleshy-fruited plant diversity and fruit biomass values as a result of the proliferation of shade-intolerant plants. This site also had the highest density of d. Gliroides. These findings are consistent with connell's intermediate disturbance hypothesis, suggesting that coexistence of people with nature is possible if wood extraction volumes are moderate, increasing plant diversity. Indigenous communities have sustainably used natural resources for centuries, but current rates of land-use change are becoming a significant threat to both them and their natural resources.

137,2022,"Temporal changes in taxonomic and functional diversity of fish assemblages in the upper yangtze river after impoundment of the three gorges reservoir, china","Frontiers In Environmental Science","Anthropogenic disturbances are one of the primary factors that drive biodiversity loss. Temporal changes in biodiversity respond to such disturbances. In the present study, we investigated the temporal changes in taxonomic and functional diversity of fish assemblages in different habitats (three gorges reservoir, tgr; running water above the tgr, utgr; and tributary chishui river, csr) in the upper yangtze basin after impoundment of the tgr from 2008 to 2015. During the survey, the taxonomic and functional composition of fish assemblages varied among the habitats. Although taxonomic diversity increased and functional diversity decreased significantly in the entire upper yangtze basin, no significant changes in the diversities were observed in each habitat. The habitats showed directional changes in the composition of fish species. The slope of the directional changes in the tgr was more than that in the utgr and csr. These results indicated that the distribution of fish species was associated with the habitat after the impoundment. The assembly of the fish assemblage was driven primarily by the neutral process in the entire survey area but was promoted by a combination of species sorting and neutral process in each habitat. The impoundment caused more effects on the tgr than on the utgr, but it slightly affected the csr. Regarding fishing closure, conservation measures for fish diversity should be established according to the different habitats. The study findings suggest the removal of small dams in tributaries and ecological regulation in the mainstream and continuous monitoring of fish biodiversity.

Compounding this extinction crisis are cryptic species and species complexes that are evaluated under a single species epithet but harbor multiple species, each of which needs to be evaluated independently. The phrynops geoffroanus species group is a classic example. Described first in 1812, it is currently thought to harbor multiple species. To test this hypothesis, we collected mitochondrial and nuclear genomic data, morphometric data, and distribution and associated biome information. We applied statistically rigorous species delimitation analyses, taxonomic hypotheses tests, and fully coalescent phylogenetic reconstruction methods, concluding that the phrynops geoffroanus species complex comprises four geographically structured species/lineages that diverged during the pleistocene and are currently geographically structured along the main south american river basins and biomes. These species/lineages show subtle and largely non-significant differences in shape but are characterized by differences in coloration and patterns of marks on the head and plastron.

140,2022,"Confounding rules can hinder conservation: disparities in law regulation on domestic and international parrot trade within and among neotropical countries","Animals","Wildlife trade is a major driver of biodiversity loss worldwide. To regulate its impact, laws and regulations have been implemented at the international and national scales. The convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (cites) has regulated the international legal trade since 1975. However, an important volume of illegal tradeâmainly within countriesâcontinues to threaten several vertebrate groups, which could be due to a lack of specific legislation or enforcement of existing regulations. Our aim was to gain a more accurate picture of poaching and legal possession of native parrots as pets in the neotropics, where illegal domestic trade is currently widespread. We conducted a systematic search of the laws of each of the 50 countries and overseas territories, taking into account their year of implementation and whether the capture, possession and/or sale of parrots is permitted. We compared this information with legal exports reported by cites to assess differences between the enforcement of international and national trade regulations. We found that only two countries (guyana and suriname) currently allow the capture, trade and possession of native parrots, while peru allowed international legal trade until recently. The other countries have banned parrot trade from years to decades ago. However, the timing of implementation of international and national trade regulations varied greatly between countries, with half of them continuing to export parrots legally years or decades after banning domestic trade. The confusion created by this complex legal system may have hindered the adoption of conservation measures, allowing poaching, keeping and trade of protected species within and between neighboring countries. Most countries legally exported neotropical parrot species which were not native to those countries, indicating that trans-border smuggling often occurred between neighboring countries prior to their legal exportations, and that this illicit activity continues for the domestic trade. Governments are urged to effectively implement current legislation that prohibits the trapping and domestic trade of native parrots, but also to develop coordinated alliances and efforts to halt illegal trade among them. Otherwise, illegal trade will continue to erode the already threatened populations of a large number of parrot species across the neotropics. Â© 2022 by the authors.

141,2022,"Differential impacts of climatic and land use changes on habitat suitability and protected area adequacy across the asian elephantâs range","Sustainability (Switzerland)","Climate change and human activities have caused dramatic impacts on biodiversity. Although a number of international agreements or initiatives have been launched to mitigate the biodiversity loss, the erosion of terrestrial biome habitats is inevitable. Consequently, the identifica-tion of potential suitable habitats under climate change and human disturbance has become an urgent task of biodiversity conservation. In this study, we used the maximum entropy model (maxent) to identify the current and potential future habitats of asian elephants in south and southeast asia. We performed analyses for future projections with 17 scenarios using the present results as baseline. To optimize the modelling results, we delineated the core habitats by using the core mapper tool and compared them with existing protected areas (pas) through gap analysis. The results showed that the current total area of core habitats is 491,455 km2 in size and will be reduced to 332,544 km2 by 2090 under ssp585 (the shared socioeconomic pathway). The projection analysis under differential scenarios suggested that most of the core habitats in the current protected areas would remain stable and suitable for elephants in the future. However, the remaining 75.17% of the core habitats lay outside the current pas, and finally we mapped approximately 219,545 km2 of suitable habitats as priority protected areas in the future. Although our model did not perform well in some regions, our analyses and findings still could provide useful references to the planning of protected areas and conservation of asian elephant.

142,2022,"Artificial wetlands as alternative habitat for a wide range of waterbird species","Ecological Indicators","Natural wetlands are at the cutting edge of protection concerns, as they harbor a greater range of waterbird assemblages than artificial wetlands. However, more than 50.0% of natural wetland areas and more than 17.0% of waterbird species have become imperiled due to human activities over the last two decades. Thus, it is important to understand whether artificial wetlands play significant roles as alternative habitats for wetland birds. The distance sampling point count method was employed to ascertain the difference in waterbird assemblages inhabiting lungh natural wetland and raja artificial wetland in sindh province, pakistan from september 2017 to february 2019. Natural wetlands harbored 39,282 individuals representing 40 waterbird species and 14 families, while artificial wetlands hosted 23,122 individuals representing 39 species and 13 families. In total, 37 species were identified as least concern, 3 were near threatened, and one species was endangered, one vulnerable, and one data deficient. Anas crecca (4.95%) and a. Platyrhynchos (4.72%) were the foremost abundant species in natural wetlands. A. Crecca (4.57%) and a. Clypeata (3.95%) were the foremost prevailing species of artificial wetlands. Alcedo atthis, charadrius leschenaultia, and vanellus leucurus did not utilize natural wetlands, while bubulcus ibis, larus genei, tringa brevipes, and plegadis falcinellus avoided artificial wetlands. The relative abundance of waterbirds between natural and artificial wetlands varied considerably (f1, 85 = 6.26, p < 0.05). Diversity indices indicated that natural wetlands attracted a greater diversity of waterbirds than artificial wetlands. The results indicated that natural wetlands had attracted a larger number of migrating birds than artificial wetlands. In contrast, artificial wetlands harbored a wide range of resident waterbird species than natural wetlands. As a result, we accept the hypothesis that artificial wetlands may serve as an alternative habitat for a wide range of waterbird communities.

143,2022,"Multi-scale threat assessment of riverine ecosystems in the colorado river basin","Ecological Indicators","Freshwater ecosystems are facing a deepening biodiversity crisis. Developing robust indicators to assess ecological integrity across large spatial scales and identifying the specific threats and pathways of impairment are thus critically needed if we are to inform freshwater conservation strategies. Here we present the first comprehensive threat assessment across the colorado river basin â one of the largest and most endangered river basins in north america â using a spatial framework accounting for the wide range of human activities (land uses, transportation infrastructure, exploitative activities, water withdrawals), pathways (local footprint, overland runoff, upstream cumulative effects), and spatial extent of influence (valley bottom, catchment and river network) known to affect the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems. We quantified and mapped 69 individual threat indices with geospatial tools for each permanent, ephemeral, and intermittent stream segment within the basin, encompassing a total of >1,067,700 river kilometers. We further aggregated these indices into components of water quality (diffuse and point-source pollution), hydrology (flow regulation/uses and climate change), and physical system (connectivity and geomorphology). To demonstrate the potential of our framework to inform spatial planning decision processes, we examined the typical combinations of threats experienced by different hydrologic areas and stream segment types, identified candidate watersheds for habitat restoration and enhancement where hotspots of biodiversity and threat overlapped, and assessed the associations between threat indices and in situ measurements of ecological integrity describing a suite of biological (benthic macroinvertebrate, fish), chemical (total nitrogen load, water conductivity), hydrological (flow alteration) and physical indicators (streambed stability, instream habitat complexity). Our assessment highlights clear disparities in term of overall degree of threat that result from different combinations and contributions of individual stressors, with different priorities emerging for perennial versus intermittent or ephemeral stream segments, and between the upper and lower parts of the basin. Importantly, we showed that our threat indices were generally correlated with biological, chemical, hydrological and physical indicators of ecological integrity they were intended to capture. In addition to its implications for the conservation and management of the highly imperiled colorado river basin, our case study illustrates how multi-faceted threat mapping can be used to assess the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems in the absence of spatially extensive in situ measurements.

144,2022,"Soundscapes of urban parks: an innovative approach for ecosystem monitoring and adaptive management","Urban Forestry And Urban Greening","Urban foresters are addressing the challenge of urban biodiversity loss through management plans in the context of rapid urbanization. Protecting the integrity of the urban ecosystem requires long-term monitoring and planning for resilience as well as effective management. The soundscape assessment has attracted attention in this field, but applying the soundscape assessment in urban ecological monitoring requires a protocol that links soundscapes to the impact of resource management on biodiversity over time. The effective processing and visualization of large-scale data also remains an important challenge. The aim of this study was to better understand the relationship between soundscape and physical environment, and examine the feasibility of this innovative soundscape approach in highly urbanized areas. Soundscape recordings were collected for 20 urban parks twice on 4 consecutive days in spring. A total of 691,200 min of sound material were automatically obtained. In order to track the spatio-temporal patterns of a soundscape and determine its potential suitability for ecosystem monitoring, our study characterized soundscape information by adopting 4 widely used acoustic indices: acoustic diversity index (adi), bioacoustic index (bio), normalized difference vegetation index (ndsi), and power spectral density (psd). Daily patterns of psd have provided a potential connection between soundscapes and bird songs, and 1â2 khz presented a similar pattern that was linked to human activity. Through further modeling, we tested the relationship of soundscapes to physical environment characteristics. The results showed the importance of habitat vegetation structure for acoustic diversity. More vertical heterogeneity, with an uneven canopy height or multilayered vegetation, was associated with more acoustic diversity. This suggests that clearing ground cover may have a significant negative impact on wildlife. Our results suggest that soundscape approaches provide a way to quickly synthesize large-scale recording data into meaningful patterns that can track changes in bird songs and ecosystem conditions. The proposed approach would enable regular assessment of urban parks and forests to inform adaptive planning and management strategies that can maintain or enhance biodiversity.

145,2022,"No evidence for trade-offs between bird diversity, yield and water table depth on oil palm smallholdings: implications for tropical peatland landscape restoration","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Tropical peat swamp forests retain large carbon stocks and support unique biodiversity, but clearance and drainage for agriculture have resulted in fires, carbon emissions and biodiversity losses. Initiatives to re-wet cultivated peatlands may benefit biodiversity if this protects remaining forests from fire and agricultural encroachment, but there are concerns that re-wetting could reduce yields and damage livelihoods, as relationships between drainage, on-farm biodiversity, and crop yields have not been studied. We examined oil palm fruit yields and bird diversity on 41 smallholder farms in jambi (sumatra, indonesia), which varied in drainage intensity (12-month mean water table per plot from august 2018 to august 2019: â52 to â3â cm below-ground). We also compared farm bird diversity with a neighbouring area of protected peat swamp forest (11,000â ha, 21 plots; mean water table per plot â3 to +15â cm). Bird species richness (3â18 species per plot), species composition and oil palm yields (4.5â19.2â t fresh fruit bunch haâ1â yearâ1) varied among farms, but were not detectably affected by water table depth, although ground-level vegetation was more complex on wetter farms. Bird richness in oil palm (meanâ =â 10.3 species per plot) was <50% of that in forest (26 species per plot), and only 3 of 35 conservation-priority species found in forest were recorded in oil palm. Synthesis and applications. Tropical peatlands in indonesia have been drained to allow farmer access and improve farm yields, but we found no trade-offs between drainage depth, yields and bird diversity on smallholder oil palm farms in our study landscape within the studied range of drainage depths. Current restoration initiatives to re-wet peat may benefit farmers by reducing fire risk, without affecting yields. Wetter farms had increased understorey vegetation complexity, but this did not affect bird diversity, so we find no evidence that re-wetting improves on-farm biodiversity. However, on-farm fire reduction efforts in cultivated peatlands, including re-wetting, will be vital for reducing the risk of fires escaping into nearby forests, which contain unique and diverse bird species assemblages. Protection of remaining peatland forests from fire and clearance is key for biodiversity conservation, and for providing a source of seed dispersers and genetic material for future forest and landscape restoration efforts. Restoration of more biodiversity-friendly land covers will improve landscape permeability and help conserve species and the ecosystem services they deliver. Â© 2022 the authors.

146,2022,"Drivers of the australian native pet trade: the role of species traits, socioeconomic attributes and regulatory systems","Journal Of Applied Ecology","The pet trade is a major driver of both biodiversity loss and the introduction of invasive alien species. Building a comprehensive understanding of the pet trade would improve prediction of conservation and biosecurity threats, with the aim to prevent further negative impacts. We used south australiaâs native wildlife permit reporting system as a data-rich example of a vertebrate pet market, spanning 590 distinct taxa across 105 families of terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, reptiles, birds and amphibians). Using a piecewise structural equation modelling (sem) approach, we tested the influence of 11 a priori variables relating to pets (e.g. Species traits), pet owners (e.g. Socioeconomic metrics) and regulatory systems (e.g. Permit requirements) on the quantities of captive pet keeping, breeding, trading and escapes into the wild. Birds and reptiles with higher annual fecundity were more likely to be kept in captivity and birds with larger adult mass were more likely to be sold. Species with more stringent permit requirements were possessed and escaped, in lower abundances. Pet keeping was weakly correlated with regions of lower human population densities and higher unemployment rates, yet all socioeconomic variables were ultimately poor at explaining trade dynamics. More escapes occurred in regions that possessed larger quantities of pets, further emphasising the role of propagule pressure in the risk of pet escapes. Synthesis and applications. Species traits are a strong determinant of native pet trade dynamics, yet permit systems also play a key role in de-incentivising undesirable trade practices. While our research highlighted the positive potential of trade regulatory systems, we recommend that consistent permit category criteria are established to reduce trade in threatened species as well as invasive alien species of high biosecurity risk. Implementation of such systems is broadly needed across a greater diversity of wildlife markets and jurisdictions. Â© 2022 the authors.

147,2022,"Temporal resource partitioning mediates vertebrate coexistence at carcasses: the role of competitive and facilitative interactions","Basic And Applied Ecology","Unravelling how biodiversity is maintained despite species competition for shared resources has been a central question in community ecology, and is gaining relevance amidst the current biodiversity crisis. Yet, we have still a poor understanding of the mechanisms that regulate species coexistence and shape the structure of assemblages in highly competitive environments such as carrion pulsed resources. Here, we study how large vertebrates coexist in scavenger assemblages by adapting their diel activity at large ungulate carcasses in nw spain. We used camera traps to record vertebrate scavengers consuming 34 carcasses of livestock and hunted wild ungulates, which allowed us to assess also differences regarding carcass origin. To evaluate temporal resource partition among species, we estimated the overlap of diel activity patterns and the mean times of each scavenger at carcasses. We recorded 16 species of scavengers, 7 mammals and 9 birds, and found similar richness at both types of carcasses. Birds and mammals showed contrasting diel activity patterns, with birds using carcasses during daytime (mean= 11:38 h) and mammals mostly at night (23:09 h). The unimodal activity patterns of scavengers showed asynchronous peaks among species. Subordinate species modified their activity patterns at carcasses used by apex species to reduce temporal overlap. Also, diel activity patterns of vultures closely followed those of corvids, suggesting facilitation processes in which corvids would enhance carcass detection by vultures. Two mammal species (12.5%) increased nocturnality at carcasses of hunted ungulates, which could be a response to human disturbance. Our results suggest that both temporal segregation and coupling mediate the coexistence of large vertebrates at carcasses. These mechanisms might lead to richer scavenger assemblages and thereby more efficient ones in driving critical ecosystem functions related to carrion consumption, such as energy and nutrient recycling and biodiversity maintenance.

In each analysis, none of the arguments founded on climate change's wide-ranging effects are as urgent for biodiversity as those for habitat loss and overexploitation.

One mechanism of achieving this is through targeted, time-limited campaigns. However, the longer-term impact of such campaigns on conservation outcomes is rarely evaluated. The goal of this study is to evaluate how zoos view âthe year of the frog,â a campaign launched by zoos in 2008, with the aim of raising awareness of the global amphibian crisis and generating funds to support amphibian conservation initiatives. A questionnaire-based survey of 43 zoos from fourteen countries was used to evaluate how zoo practitioners believed the campaign influenced amphibian conservation some 10 years after its launch. Survey results showed that the campaign not only contributed to the improvement of research into amphibian husbandry in zoos but also increased support of in situ conservation of amphibians. Zoos focused on exotic species, but developed countries led most of the actions of the campaign. The campaign has inspired and encouraged some zoos and other ex situ conservation organizations to embrace amphibian conservation. The next step is to increase collaboration with more organizations through, for example, aark and iucn ssc/asg, particularly in countries that have high amphibian biodiversity.

150,2022,"How beavers affect riverine aquatic macroinvertebrates: a review","Peerj","Background: as ecosystem engineers, the construction of dams by beavers alters stream habitat physically and biologically, making them a species of interest for habitat restoration. Beaver-created habitat changes affect a wide range of aquatic invertebrate species. However, despite numerous individual studies of how beavers affect aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages, there has been no evaluation of the consensus of these effects across studies. Methodology: we collated and examined studies comparing beaver-created ponds to nearby lotic reaches to determine general trends in aquatic macroinvertebrate richness, density, biomass, and functional composition between habitats. From this evidence, we highight knowledge gaps in how beaver activity affects aquatic macroinvertebrates. Results: overall, in the majority of studies, aquatic macroinvertebrate richness was higher in nearby lotic reaches compared to beaver-created ponds, but richness at coarser scales (gamma diversity) increased with the addition of beaver ponds due to increased habitat heterogeneity. Functional feeding group (ffg) patterns were highly context-dependent, though predator taxa were generally more abundant in beaver ponds than adjacent lotic reaches. Site-specific geomorphological changes, coupled with dam or riparian zone characteristics and resulting differences in basal food resources likely shape other ffg responses. Conclusions: we identify a lack of long-term studies at single or multiple sites and conclude that fine-scale approaches may improve our understanding of the dynamics of macroinvertebrates within the freshwater realm and beyond. Due to the context-dependent nature of each study, further systematic studies of beaver engineering effects across a wider variety of environmental conditions and wetland types will also help inform land and species management decisions, such as where to prioritize protection of beaver habitats in the face of a global freshwater biodiversity crisis, or where to restore beaver populations to deliver maximum benefit.

151,2022,"Rapid site selection to prioritize coastal seascapes for nature-based solutions with multiple benefits","Frontiers In Marine Science","Coastal seascapes are productive and diverse land-sea systems that provide many valuable benefits yet are increasingly threatened by human activity. Scaling up of nature-based solutions (nbs) to effectively protect, sustainably manage, and restore coastal seascapes is urgently required for mitigation of climate change and biodiversity loss while also providing socio-economic benefits. Evidence-based site selection is an important first step to improve the outcomes and avoid negative impacts when prioritizing nbs investments at national level. We developed a spatially explicit, integrative and culturally relevant ecosystem-based site selection process to identify a portfolio of seascapes for nbs consideration in the united arab emirates (uae). The primary goal was to rank planning units based on potential for climate change mitigation action, positive impact to biodiversity and socio-economic benefits to people. The multi-criteria site-selection framework provided a rapid, transparent, repeatable and scalable tool. The highest weightings were assigned to blue carbon storage value, biodiversity conservation features, and local stakeholder preferred areas. Spatial proxies for benefits to people were represented by population density and accessibility to coastal seascapes, relative tourism and recreation potential, and importance of fish habitat and fishing grounds for food security. Participatory mapping of local knowledge and review of existing data ensured that both qualitative and quantitative criteria were reliable, up-to-date and locally relevant. Two distinct clusters of high suitability planning units were identified in the abu dhabi region and four along the north-western coast of the uae. Most high suitability sites were located outside of existing marine protected areas. Alternative spatial scenarios without stakeholder bias underscored the suitability of sites identified through participatory mapping and highlighted additional priority sites for future scaling-up of nbs. A spatial corridor of medium and high suitability planning units across the region offers potential for designing well-connected nbs investments to accelerate and boost synergistic outcomes and increase resilience. The site selection framework provides a rapid tool that integrates local and global open access data at a range of scales with great potential for transferability to other regions worldwide.

152,2022,"Habitat characteristics supporting bird species richness in mid-field woodlots","Frontiers In Environmental Science","Farmland biodiversity has undergone drastic declines due to agricultural intensification during the last decades. To prevent further biodiversity loss, the maintenance and restoration of non-productive habitats is essential. Woodlots, small patches of woody vegetation in agricultural landscapes, are one such habitat that are currently subsidized by the european unionâs common agricultural policy (euâs cap). For effective implementation, however, it is necessary to assess what habitat characteristics are the most beneficial for biodiversity. Our study performs such an assessment using birds as model organisms. Specifically, we related characteristics of various woodlots to (i) the species richness of all birds, and (ii) the species richness of both forest and farmland birdsâgroups with different ecological requirements. For this purpose, we counted birds (27 farmland and 26 forest species) and measured habitat characteristics (describing vegetation structure, diversity and nativeness) and spatial characteristics (area, shape and isolation) in 82 mid-field woodlots (0.76â1.25â ha, average 0.46â ha) in the czech republic (central europe). After accounting for the effects of spatial characteristics, overall bird species richness increased with vegetation height and woody plant species richness. In addition, richness showed a non-linear decrease with the cover of an invasive tree, the black locust robinia pseudoaccacia. Interestingly, forest bird species richness was related to the same habitat characteristics as the overall bird species richness. By contrast, farmland bird species richness was positively related to the diversity of woodlot microhabitats, which reflects mainly enrichment by non-forest sites such as grassland or sparse shrubs. Our results indicate that the ecological performance of habitat characteristics (and not only the woodlot area) is important for the restoration of bird diversity in woodlots, and as such should be taken into consideration by the euâs cap subsidy system. Moreover, if woodlot management aims to maximize the overall bird diversityâa common practice in biodiversity conservationâour results show that current practices may favor widespread forest bird species, but not the farmland birds that are more threatened in europe. To manage the woodlot habitat for farmland birds, we suggest that microhabitat heterogeneity should be maximized.

153,2022,"Long-term monitoring reveals widespread and severe declines of understory birds in a protected neotropical forest","Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America","Long-term studies on the population dynamics of tropical resident birds are few, and it remains poorly understood how their populations have fared in recent decades. Here, we analyzed a 44-y population study of a neotropical understory bird assemblage from a protected forest reserve in central panama to determine if and how populations have changed from 1977 to 2020. Using the number of birds captured in mist nets as an index of local abundance, we estimated trends over time for a diverse suite of 57 resident species that comprised a broad range of ecological and behavioral traits. Estimated abundances of 40 (â¼70%) species declined over the sampling period, whereas only 2 increased. Furthermore, declines were severe: 35 of the 40 declining species exhibited large proportional losses in estimated abundance, amounting to â¥50% of their initial estimated abundances. Declines were largely independent of ecology (i.e., body mass, foraging guild, or initial abundance) or phylogenetic affiliation. These widespread, severe declines are particularly alarming, given that they occurred in a relatively large (â¼22,000-ha) forested area in the absence of local fragmentation or recent land-use change. Our findings provide robust evidence of tropical bird declines in intact forests and bolster a large body of literature from temperate regions suggesting that bird populations may be declining at a global scale. Identifying the ecological mechanisms underlying these declines should be an urgent conservation priority.

154,2022,"Land-use intensity and landscape structure drive the acoustic composition of grasslands","Agriculture, Ecosystems And Environment","Understanding drivers and monitoring changes of biodiversity forms the basis for evidence-based management and policy recommendations that aim to reduce biodiversity loss and to ensure the delivery of ecosystem services on which we rely. Ecoacoustic monitoring can be applied across large spatial and temporal scales, offering the potential for less resource-intensive ecosystem monitoring. Indices of acoustic diversity have been shown to correlate with species richness of various taxa, as well as vegetation and landscape structure. In order to apply ecoacoustic monitoring at large scales we need to improve our understanding of the effects of local and regional land-use on acoustic patterns, and assess how temporal aspects of acoustic patterns can be integrated in these analyses. We hypothesized that land-use intensity and landscape structure affect species richness and composition of birds and orthopteran, and therefore indirectly affect acoustic diversity and composition. To test this, we set up autonomous recording systems in grassland plots along land-use intensity gradients in three regions in germany. We applied structural equation modelling to analyze the direct and indirect drivers of acoustic diversity and composition, including mowing and grazing intensities, landscape diversity, distance to the nearest road, vascular plant species richness as well as bird and orthopteran species richness and composition. Single indices of acoustic diversity did not reflect changes in bird or orthopteran species richness, making them poor predictors for local land-use related changes in species richness in grassland plots. Acoustic composition (non-metric multidimensional scaling combination of mean monthly acoustic indices at different day phases), however, did relate to differences in landscape structure, land-use intensity, vocalizing species composition and orthopteran species richness. We propose the developed acoustic composition metric as suitable proxy to detect ecosystem changes in grasslands.

155,2022,"Genetics and community-based restoration can guide conservation of forest fragments for endangered primates","Perspectives In Ecology And Conservation","As deforestation progresses in the tropics, wildlife populations are increasingly restricted to forest fragments. Here we study genetic population structure in the endangered ashy red colobus (piliocolobus tephrosceles) population in the forest fragments surrounding kibale national park, uganda. Subsequently, we use landscape features (elevation, road data and distance to the park) to design a feasible strategy to restore forest in a fashion suitable for both the dispersal patterns of the species and land use practices of the local people. A lack of association between geographic distance and pairwise genetic relatedness among localities, the presence of first degree relatives across localities, and a low global fst value suggest that red colobus individuals have migrated across this landscape in the recent past. Thus, a series of âstepping stoneâ forests from the fragments to the park will likely maintain viability of red colobus fragment populations. In this area, low-lying valleys are legally protected to prevent flooding and are considered of low-economic value to local people. We identify such valleys for development of community-based forest restoration efforts that will aid in red colobus conservation and provide various ecosystem services. Our study outlines how genetics and community-based restoration can be integrated to provide realistic conservation solutions.

Forests are often one of the most affected habitats, as they are frequently included in megaproject construction sites. These habitats support rich animal communities that the new settlement may threaten. Among all species present in any construction site, those listed in the habitats directive (92/43/cee) deserve particular attention as they are protected throughout europe. Here, we present a case study related to the expansion of an industrial site, part of the megaproject turinâlyon high-speed railway, where forest compensations were used to reverse biodiversity loss. The site expansion scheduled for 2020 included mature forests and clearings that used to host a butterfly species and at least 15 bat species protected by the habitats directive and other taxa of conservation concern. Forest compensations are usually used to finance tree plantations and forest improvements. In this case study, for the first time, we used them to maintain local biodiversity, which otherwise would have been severely compromised by the site expansion. Indeed, our approach has made it possible to allocate forest compensation funding to restore or improve habitats to favor biodiversity.

157,2022,"Feeding niche overlap between native and alien fishes in swat river, khyber pakhtunkhwa, pakistan","Environmental Biology Of Fishes","One of the major causes of biodiversity loss in freshwater ecosystems is the introduction of alien species. The common carp has been established in every freshwater ecosystem of pakistan and is a leading threat to the native ichthyofauna. In the present study, stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon (î15n and î13c) are used to explore the feeding niche overlap among alien cyprinus carpio (common carp) and native omnivorous fishes including tor putitora (mahseer) and barilius pakistanicus (pakistani chalwa) from swat river, khyber pakhtunkhwa (kp), pakistan. Differences in mean values of î15n and î13c among the species were found non-significant. Community-wide metrics within î13c-î15n bi-plot space reflecting vital aspects of the trophic structure were also calculated. It was found that all the selected species were feeding at the same trophic level, whereas niche size and trophic diversity of common carp was greater compared to both of the native species which indicated that this alien fish is a highly opportunistic feeder on different food items with multiple basal resources having a wide range of î13c values. Mahseer occupied a very small trophic niche within the niche space of common carp. This shows that mahseer is relatively a specialist feeder on fewer food sources; hence, mahseer might be subjected to the higher threat posed by the alien species. The trophic niche area of pakistani chalwa was also smaller than common carp but wider than mahseer indicating a relatively lower degree of overlap with common carp.

158,2022,"Landscape-scale conservation mitigates the biodiversity loss of grassland birds","Ecological Applications","The decline of biodiversity from anthropogenic landscape modification is among the most pressing conservation problems worldwide. In north america, long-term population declines have elevated the recovery of the grassland avifauna to among the highest conservationpriorities. Because the vast majority of grasslands of the great plains are privately owned, the recovery of these ecosystems and bird populations within them depend on landscape-scale conservation strategies that integrate social, economic, and biodiversity objectives. The conservation reserve program (crp) is a voluntary program for private agricultural producers administered by the united states department of agriculture that provides financial incentives to take cropland out of production and restore perennial grassland. We investigated spatial patterns of grassland availability and restoration to inform landscape-scale conservation for a comprehensive community of grassland birds in the great plains. The research objectives were to (1) determine how apparent habitat loss has affected spatial patterns of grassland bird biodiversity, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of crp for offsetting the biodiversity declines of grassland birds, and (3) develop spatially explicit predictions to estimate the biodiversity benefit of adding crp to landscapes impacted by habitat loss. We used the integrated monitoring in bird conservation regions program to evaluate hypotheses for the effects of habitat loss and restoration on both the occupancy and species richness of grassland specialists within a continuum-modeling framework. We found the odds of community occupancy declined by 37% for every 1 sd decrease in grassland availability [loge(km2)] and increased by 20% for every 1 sd increase in crp land cover [loge(km2)]. There was 17% turnover in species composition between intact grasslands and crp landscapes, suggesting that grasslands restored by crp retained considerable, but incomplete, representation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Spatially explicit predictions indicated that absolute conservation outcomes were greatest at high latitudes in regions with high biodiversity, whereas the relative outcomes were greater at low latitudes in highly modified landscapes. By evaluating community-wide responses to landscape modification and crp restoration at bioregional scales, our study fills key information gaps for developing collaborative strategies, and for balancing conservation of avian biodiversity and social well-being in the agricultural production landscapes of the great plains.

Following the scientific description of the kipunji (rungwecebus kipunji), we implemented a range of long-term conservation interventions. Thirteen years later, we reassess with a complete count the population size, demography, and distribution of r. Kipunji in tanzaniaâs southern highlands, employing the identical sweep census methods across 1,428 km. We also monitored a habituated group daily over the same period. We report a total of 1,866 individuals in 59 groups (î = 31.63 â± se 1.2) in livingstone forest (within kitulo national park), mt rungwe nature reserve, and madehani village forest. We estimate a 65% increase in individuals, a 59% increase in group numbers, and a 19% increase in area of occupancy (aoo). Mean group sizes were similar in mt rungwe (32.9) and livingstone (31.9), but lower in the unprotected madehani (24). The ratio of adult females to adult males was significantly higher in mt rungwe than livingstone. The ratio of subadults/juveniles to adult females, a proxy for survival, was good (1.77), but higher in livingstone (2.61) than mt rungwe (1.11). In the habituated group, we recorded a 121% increase in group size. Signs of human activity fell by 81%, with a 100% and 98% reduction in the number of charcoal pits and timber felling, respectively, in mt rungwe. Both temporal and spatial data demonstrate that long-term holistic conservation leads to increased primate numbers.

160,2022,"The sixth mass extinction: fact, fiction or speculation?","Biological Reviews","There have been five mass extinction events in the history of earth's biodiversity, all caused by dramatic but natural phenomena. It has been claimed that the sixth mass extinction may be underway, this time caused entirely by humans. Although considerable evidence indicates that there is a biodiversity crisis of increasing extinctions and plummeting abundances, some do not accept that this amounts to a sixth mass extinction. Often, they use the iucn red list to support their stance, arguing that the rate of species loss does not differ from the background rate. However, the red list is heavily biased: almost all birds and mammals but only a minute fraction of invertebrates have been evaluated against conservation criteria. Incorporating estimates of the true number of invertebrate extinctions leads to the conclusion that the rate vastly exceeds the background rate and that we may indeed be witnessing the start of the sixth mass extinction. As an example, we focus on molluscs, the second largest phylum in numbers of known species, and, extrapolating boldly, estimate that, since around ad 1500, possibly as many as 7.5â13% (150,000â260,000) of all ~2 million known species have already gone extinct, orders of magnitude greater than the 882 (0.04%) on the red list. We review differences in extinction rates according to realms: marine species face significant threats but, although previous mass extinctions were largely defined by marine invertebrates, there is no evidence that the marine biota has reached the same crisis as the non-marine biota. Island species have suffered far greater rates than continental ones. Plants face similar conservation biases as do invertebrates, although there are hints they may have suffered lower extinction rates. There are also those who do not deny an extinction crisis but accept it as a new trajectory of evolution, because humans are part of the natural world; some even embrace it, with a desire to manipulate it for human benefit. We take issue with these stances. Humans are the only species able to manipulate the earth on a grand scale, and they have allowed the current crisis to happen. Despite multiple conservation initiatives at various levels, most are not species oriented (certain charismatic vertebrates excepted) and specific actions to protect every living species individually are simply unfeasible because of the tyranny of numbers. As systematic biologists, we encourage the nurturing of the innate human appreciation of biodiversity, but we reaffirm the message that the biodiversity that makes our world so fascinating, beautiful and functional is vanishing unnoticed at an unprecedented rate. In the face of a mounting crisis, scientists must adopt the practices of preventive archaeology, and collect and document as many species as possible before they disappear. All this depends on reviving the venerable study of natural history and taxonomy. Denying the crisis, simply accepting it and doing nothing, or even embracing it for the ostensible benefit of humanity, are not appropriate options and pave the way for the earth to continue on its sad trajectory towards a sixth mass extinction.

161,2022,"Evaluating conservation tools in intensively-used farmland: higher bird and mammal diversity in seed-rich strips during winter","Agriculture, Ecosystems And Environment","Farmland biodiversity have experienced a steep decline over recent decades. Various conservation measures, including eu agri-environmental schemes (aes), have been designed to prevent further biodiversity loss. Despite the aes were criticized for limited benefits for biodiversity, the existing conservation evidence demonstrated some aes, such as seed-rich strips (srs), can have a positive effect on overall biodiversity. However, evidence of the effectiveness of srs during winter is largely missing in eastern europe or it is based on single-species evaluations. In our study, we investigate the effects of srs on several taxa typical of the farmland (i.e., farmland birds, european hare, roe deer and small mammals) during winter, when these species may suffer from a lack of food sources. More specifically, we evaluated the effect of spatial location (hedges, forests, and open fields), time in the season (early and late winter), and area (single large or several small analysis, i.e., âsloss analysisâ) of srs on species richness and abundance of birds and mammals. Srs showed higher species richness and abundance than control transects, except for roe deer. The largest differences in abundance and species richness of farmland birds between the srs and the controls were found in the fields. The highest abundance of european hare and small mammals were found in srs located in the fields. Ordination analysis indicated that several bird species preferred srs. Moreover, different birds occurred in strips adjacent to open fields, hedges, and forest, indicating that the landscape context of srs can affect its use by different bird species. We found a significant decrease in the abundance of farmland birds and declining farmland species during late winter in the srs, but not in the controls, suggesting the srs may be depleted of seeds towards the end of winter. Finally, the sloss analysis indicated there was no clear difference in species richness between small-to-large and large-to-small strips accumulation, but the pooled abundance of all birds and mammals was generally higher at a few large rather than many small patches of the same cumulative size. Our findings suggest that srs are a simple and cost-effective measure for farmland biodiversity conservation. Even relatively small srs are used by many species and therefore should be promoted. Srs careful planning (e.g., location of srs within the landscape and the choice of seed mixtures) can improve their effectiveness for biodiversity conservation.

162,2022,"Corridors in heavily fragmented landscapes: reconnecting populations of critically endangered brown spider monkeys (ateles hybridus) and sympatric terrestrial vertebrates in the lowland rainforests of central colombia","Restoration Ecology","In tropical ecosystems, habitat degradation and fragmentation are some of the most important drivers of biodiversity loss. In colombia, the magdalena river basin is home to a megadiverse wildlife community, which has been historically exposed to pervasive habitat loss and fragmentation. Within a long-term project on the conservation of critically endangered brown spider monkeys (ateles hybridus), we signed conservation agreements with local landowners to protect the remaining forests and reconnect them through restoration corridors. We established 10 corridors within a matrix of pastures used for cattle-ranching which reconnect approximately 1,000 ha of forests. We planted trees in 2016/2017 and 2020, established 24 vegetation plots (10 ã 10â m) to measure their structure and composition, and compared them with six vegetation plots (50 ã 2â m) in forest fragments. We installed camera traps to evaluate the effectiveness of corridors as potential pathways for terrestrial vertebrates in a fragmented landscape. Overall, forest structure differed between young corridors (1â year) and both older corridors (5 years) and forests; older corridors had no structural differences with forest fragments. Throughout this preliminary survey, 21 out of 32 species of vertebrates that have been recorded in forests used the corridors, including apex predators and other large birds and mammals. This study provides initial data supporting the use of corridors as a strategy to reconnect wildlife in isolated forest fragments in heavily fragmented landscapes, as well as the establishment of effective corridors that reconnect forest-dwelling species in relatively short periods of time (<5 years).

163,2022,"Trait shifts in bird communities from primary forest to human settlements in mexican seasonal forests. Are there ruderal birds?","Perspectives In Ecology And Conservation","Agriculture, cattle grazing, and human settlements negatively affect bird biodiversity, driving the loss of ecologically specialized species and favoring the dominance of generalists. Because ecological pressures define organismsâ success by acting on their intrinsic traits, biodiversity loss due to anthropization might cause directional trait shifts. Here, we use a trait-based approach to find empirical evidence of trait-shifts in bird communities across an anthropization gradient in seasonal forests in central mexico. We performed point-count bird surveys within a region of tropical deciduous and seasonal oak forests considering three degrees of anthropization: primary forest, secondary growth, and human settlements. A multivariate analysis (pca) showed similar trait-covariation patterns for both forest types; in the anthropized habitat the bird communities exhibited shorter life-cycles, higher fecundity, and broader ecological niches (diet, foraging habitat, and nesting resources) than those in the primary forests. Our finding of directional trait shifts resembles evolutionary ecological strategies theory (ees) predictions for successful organisms within highly disturbed anthropized habitats, which are known as a âruderal adaptative strategyâ in the ees framework. The use of trait-based approaches could improve ecological generalizations in bird communities, leading to a better understanding of avian biodiversity's responses to anthropization.

164,2022,"Passive acoustic monitoring reveals the role of habitat affinity in sensitivity of sub-tropical east asian bats to fragmentation","Remote Sensing In Ecology And Conservation","Hydropower infrastructure represents a major driver of habitat loss and insular fragmentation worldwide, mostly across the tropics and sub-tropics. Despite growing evidence of dam-induced impacts on biodiversity, the effects of insular habitat fragmentation on species assemblages remain poorly understood, particularly for east asian vertebrates. Here, we assess how insectivorous bats respond to forest fragmentation in thousand island lake, a mega-hydroelectric dam in east china. Bat assemblages were surveyed across 36 land-bridge islands of different sizes and degrees of isolation, using audiomoth recorders. Echolocation calls were classified into sonotypes, each corresponding to either single or multiple species, which were further classified according to their habitat affinities into forest or open-space foragers. Based on 22 875 five-min recordings from 108 detector-nights, we recorded 15 bat sonotypes, eight of which we classified as forest sonotypes (2329 bat passes) and seven as open-space sonotypes (52 277 bat passes). Overall, sonotype richness increased with island area, but only above a certain threshold (34 ha). Habitat affinity played an important role in ensemble-level responses to fragmentation; forest sonotype richness increased with island area, whereas open-space sonotype activity was higher in more isolated islands. Our results highlight the relevance of particularly large fragments (>1000 ha) to maintain area-sensitive forest bat species. However, islands below 34 ha in size and those more isolated from the mainland are also of conservation value as they, correspondingly, harbour a variable (but substantial) number of species and concentrate higher activity of open-space foragers. These findings further demonstrate that acoustic sampling methods, as the one presented here, are able to provide key information for evidence-based policies aimed at halting the ongoing wave of dam-induced biodiversity loss.

165,2022,"Wild meat trade over the last 45 years in the peruvian amazon","Conservation Biology","The trade in wild meat is an important economic component of rural people's livelihoods, but it has been perceived to be among the main causes of the decline of wildlife species. Recently, the covid-19 pandemic has brought to light an additional concern of wildlife markets as a major human-health challenge. We analyzed data from the largest longitudinal monitoring (1973â2018) of the most important urban wild-meat markets in iquitos, peru, to examine the trends in and impacts of these markets on people's livelihoods. Over the last 45 years, wild meat sales increased at a rate of 6.4 t/year (sd 2.17), paralleling urban population growth. Wild meat sales were highest in 2018 (442 t), contributing us$2.6 million (0.76%) to the regional gross domestic product. Five species of ungulates and rodents accounted for 88.5% of the amount of biomass traded. Vulnerable and endangered species represented 7.0% and 0.4% of individuals sold, respectively. Despite growth in sales, the contribution of wild meat to overall urban diet was constant: 1â2%/year of total meat consumed. This result was due to greater availability and higher consumption of cheaper meats (e.g., in 2018, poultry was 45.8% cheaper and was the most consumed meat) coupled with the lack of economic incentives to harvest wild meat species in rural areas. Most wild meat was sold salted or smoked, reducing the likelihood of foodborne diseases. Community-based wildlife management plans and the continued trade bans on primates and threatened taxa may avoid biodiversity loss. Considering the recent covid-19 pandemic, future management plans should include potential viral hosts and regulation and enforcement of hygiene practices in wild-meat markets. Â© 2021 the authors.

166,2022,"The good, the bad, and the ugly of urbanization: response of a bird community in the neotropical andes","Frontiers In Ecology And Evolution","Urbanization constitutes one of the most aggressive drivers of habitat and biodiversity loss worldwide. However, studies focused on determining the response of local biodiversity to urbanization are still scarce, especially in tropical ecosystems. Urban ecosystems are characterized by low biological productivity which in turn leads to a reduction in biodiversity. However, the responses to urbanization should be species dependent. For instance, changes in the availability of resources can favor certain species with specific characteristics. We assessed the effects of the urbanization process on a bird community in a city located in the tropical andes of southern ecuador, a region widely recognized for its diversity and endemism of birds. We selected three independent localities in each of the four levels of the urbanization gradient in the study area (forest, forest-pasture, pasture, and urban). In each locality, we sampled the bird community by visual and auditory surveys along 1 km transects between 2016 and 2017. We recorded a total of 1,257 individuals belonging to 74 bird species. We evaluated if the responses of richness and abundance of birds are dependent on trophic guild and foraging strata. We found a significant decrease in bird species richness and abundance from forest to urban sites. However, the response of birds was dependent on the trophic guild and foraging strata. Granivorous birds showed a positive response associated with the urbanization gradient while insectivorous birds showed a negative response. Insectivorous birds were more abundant in forest sites and decreased in abundance across the urbanization gradient. We found that the proportion of birds using different foraging strata drastically changed along urban gradient. Forest sites exhibited a bird community using a variety of habitats, but the bird community became simpler toward the most urbanized sites. Our findings showed different effects of urbanization on bird communities. The ugly: urbanization leads to a dramatic reduction in the diversity of birds, which is consistent in cities with different characteristics and ecological contexts. On the other hand, the responses of bird guilds to urbanization are species dependent. Some guilds are positively impacted by urbanization and show increases in species richness and abundance while other guilds are negatively impacted.

167,2022,"Gone with the water: the loss of genetic variability in black and gold howler monkeys (alouatta caraya) due to dam construction","Frontiers In Ecology And Evolution","Black and gold howler monkeys (alouatta caraya) inhabit several eco-regions in south america with the highest population densities in riverine forests. Dam construction for electricity production represents a severe human alteration of ecosystems with consequences for primate conservation. To evaluate the possible loss of genetic diversity in a. Caraya, we analysed and compared the genetic structure of the species across 22 study sites in argentina (14), paraguay (1), and brazil (7). Four of these study sites (referred to as flooded) were sampled before dam-linked flooding which most likely caused a drastic decline or functional extinction of these populations. The genetic variability of 256 individuals was evaluated using 10 autosomal microsatellites (strs) and 112 individuals by sequencing a fragment of 507 bp of mtdna. Dna was extracted from tissue, blood, and faecal samples. Significantly higher values of genetic variability were observed for the flooded populations both in mtdna and strs. Population genetic structure showed a k = 1, 2, or 5 depending on the method, separating argentinian and paraguayan sites from brazilian sites and, in the case of k = 5, two clusters were mostly represented by flooded populations. Isolation-by-distance analyses showed that geographic distances influence gene flow. Analytical methods, such as pairwise fstâs and neiâs and regression model of harpending and ward, were concordant in detecting significant genetic structuring between flooded and remaining sites examined. Although some sites have very low sample sizes, these samples are of great importance since these sampling sites are currently flooded. Our results show that the study sites where dams were built had the greatest genetic diversity. As a. Caraya is currently severely threatened by yellow fever outbreaks, the remaining populations may be more vulnerable to disease outbreaks due to impoverished genetic variability. Accordingly, it is essential to implement management actions to conserve the remaining populations. Our results underline the importance for environmental impact assessments (eia) to include data on the genetic structure of species in the affected sites prior to their alteration or destruction. These genetic data are also remarkably important for determining where to relocate specific individuals to help avoid biodiversity loss.

River fish, as an important part of freshwater ecosystems, are under threat of population degradation and biodiversity loss in the process of development and utilization of river water energy resources. The ecological operation of the reservoir is eco-environmental protection to alleviate the negative impact on ecosystems, which artificially creates hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions to meet the requirement of fish during key life periods. However, based on ecological operation practical experience, there are circumstances where downstream flow conditions are inconsistent with the fish requirement in local periods affected by different operation conditions of reservoirs. That means the ecological operation still needs improvement. This paper takes the three gorges dam, the world's largest power station, and the downstream gezhouba dam, as a case study, builds a joint operation model of cascade reservoirs, simulates and analyzes the feasibility of the cascade reservoirs to improve the spawning conditions of fish in the downstream river reaches under joint operation and discusses the optimal strategy.

What's more, the hydropower generation output can be improved to a certain extent, thus achieving win-win progress of ecology and economics. The results of this paper show that gezhouba reservoir can adjust the daily discharge process of the three gorges reservoir by the re-regulation during a specific period of ecological operation, which may function as a useful reference for the optimization practice of ecological operation of cascade reservoirs.

169,2022,"Developing a national indicator of functional connectivity","Ecological Indicators","Habitat loss is a significant driver of biodiversity loss, causing fragmentation into small, isolated patches of suitable land cover. This reduces the permeability of landscapes to the movement of individuals and reduces the likelihood of metapopulation persistence. Quantifying functional connectivity, the ability of a focal species to move between resource patches, is therefore essential for conservation management. There is substantial evidence supporting a technique based on âpopulation synchronyâ- the degree of correlation in time-series of annual population growth rates between different long-term monitoring sites, to provide a measure of functional connectivity. However, synchronised population dynamics are not only driven by the movement of individuals between sites, but also shared environmental conditions which must be accounted for. Here, we use species survey data from over four decades to investigate average levels and temporal trends in population synchrony for 58 british bird and butterfly species. We first show that population synchrony is significantly associated with synchrony in some seasonal climatic variables. Once we accounted for spatiotemporal climatic patterns, we found that synchrony in butterflies declined over time by 71% between 1985 and 2000 but increased by 64% in recent years. Synchrony in birds showed some decline between 1999 and 2005, after which there appears to being recovery, however most species (74%) show no significant overall change in synchrony. Our proposed indicator provides a âspecies-eye-viewâ of functional connectivity using widely available abundance data. Developing such indicators of functional connectivity, which can be updated annually, is crucial to improve the effectiveness of land management strategies for conservation under increasing environmental change.

170,2022,"A flagship species-based approach to efficient, cost-effective biodiversity conservation in the qinling mountains, china","Journal Of Environmental Management","Prioritizing threatened species protection has been proposed as an efficient response to the global biodiversity crisis. We used in-situ conservation data to predict the potential habitat area of four flagship species: the giant panda (ailuropoda melanoleuca), golden monkey (rhinopithecus roxella quinlingensis), takin (budorcas taxicolor bedfordi), and crested ibis (nipponia nippon). We then designed systematic conservation planning schemes for various scenarios given species habitat preferences and anthropogenic activities and conducted a cost-effectiveness assessment. Broadly, the geographical distributions of suitable habitats for giant pandas, golden monkeys, and takins exhibited high spatial congruence (correlation coefficients of 0.59â0.90), and areas of high congruence were concentrated in the northern portion of the qinling mountains at high elevation (>1500 m). By contrast, the crested ibis was negatively correlated in space with its sympatric species (â0.47 to â0.29). Crested ibis habitats were clustered in the southern portion of the region at low elevation (<1500 m). A hypothetical conservation priority area (cpa) based on the giant panda, golden monkey, and takin included 39.64% of the qinling mountains and 100%, 99.99%, 99.59%, and 7.84% of the suitable habitats for giant pandas, golden monkeys, takins, and crested ibises, respectively. The same area included 99.07%, 70.87%, and 39.96% of the highly important areas for the ecosystem services of biodiversity conservation, water supply, and soil retention, respectively, and only 4.62%, 16.83%, and 13.4% of the area were associated with high-density residential area, impervious surfaces, and cropland, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that a cpa approach based on the specialist species could result in effective, low-cost biodiversity conservation in the qinling mountains. However, we note that existing protected areas account for only 26.52% of the cpa. We recommend that the main area of the proposed qinling national park should be based on the cpa developed here.

171,2022,"Unused railway lines as a contributor to bird abundance, species richness and diversity in intensively managed farmland","Agriculture, Ecosystems And Environment","Agricultural landscapes are characterized by a variety of habitats resulting from man-made transformations of the natural environment. Progressing agricultural intensification is leading to a reduction in natural and semi-natural habitats, resulting in turn in a loss of biodiversity. In farmland, natural habitats such as field margins, hedgerows, and meadows are progressively declining or being transformed. There is a need for regionally adjusted schemes that balance agricultural production and biodiversity conservation due to strong differences even within one country. We present a potential tool that can mitigate biodiversity loss in farmland ecosystems. In this study, we compared transects on three different habitat types: unused railway lines, dirt road verges and fields in terms of overall, farmland and open land bird species abundance, richness and shannon-wiener diversity index as well as community composition in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. We predicted that 1) bird abundance, species richness and diversity would be greater in vegetation structure along unused railway lines due to their spontaneous vegetation character than in other habitats, and 2) bird community composition would be different between three habitat types (unused railway lines, farmland roads and transects in farming areas). Our findings demonstrated that habitats along unused railway lines provide a suitable environment for farmland birds, increasing bird diversity in the agricultural landscape and playing a wider role in biodiversity conservation. Vegetation structures along unused railway lines may act as alternative refuges for birds in each season, providing food resources, nesting, shelter, perching, singing, and resting sites as well as constitute a kind of ecological corridor running within an intensively used agricultural landscape.

172,2022,"Effect of vertebrate exclusion on leaf litter decomposition in the coastal atlantic forest of southeast brazil","Tropical Ecology","Forest fragmentation is the main cause of biodiversity loss in the anthropocene and it is triggering a top-down cascade effect that may influence leaf litter decomposition. However, the link between biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem processes is not fully understood. We conducted an experiment to evaluate whether the exclusion of vertebrates affects the decomposition rates of different litter types (grass, a pioneer species and a mix of litters from a well preserved secondary forest). To answer this question, we placed litter bags inside artificial exclusion plots that were built in two types of vegetation coverage (abandoned pastureland and preserved forest) in the atlantic forest of southeast brazil. Our hypothesis is that vertebrate exclusion will change decomposition rates of different litter types due to the top-down cascade effect on soil invertebrates. We found out that vertebrate exclusion did not affect decomposition rates, possibly due to the overlap of ecological functions in the soil fauna responsible for the decomposition process. Furthermore, grass litter was decomposed faster (k value), possibly due to its initial nutrient content and hence litter quality which plays a significant role on decomposition rates.

173,2022,"Delineating genetic management units of sambar deer (rusa unicolor) in south-eastern australia, using opportunistic tissue sampling and targeted scat collection","Wildlife Research","Context: invasive species are major drivers of biodiversity loss, requiring management to reduce their ecological impacts. Population genetics can be applied to delineate management units, providing information that can help plan and improve control strategies. Aim: the present study aims to use a genetic approach to test the existence of three previously proposed sambar deer populations in south-eastern australia. In doing so, the study aims to delineate management units of sambar deer in south-eastern australia. Methods: sambar deer dna was sourced opportunistically from tissue samples and targeted scat collection. Samples were collected from three areas in victoria, south-eastern australia: mt cole (mc), french island (fi) and eastern victoria (ev). Contemporary population structure was assessed using a suite of 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. The number of maternal sambar deer lineages in south-eastern australia was investigated through sequencing of the mitochondrial (mt)dna control region. Key results: three distinct genetic clusters were identified. Differentiation among inferred clusters was found to be high, with fst ranging from 0.24 between ev and fi clusters and 0.48 between mc and fi clusters. Two mtdna haplotypes were identified; r.u1 was found throughout ev and fi, and r.u2 was unique to mc. Dna isolated from scats provided reliable data and proved critical for sampling areas where hunting and culling of deer are not generally undertaken. Conclusions: three genetically distinct sambar deer management units in south-eastern australia are defined-mc, fi and ev. Sambar deer control strategies should be applied to each management unit independently. This may be difficult or infeasible for the ev management unit, which is large and geographically complex. Further research may help identify additional fine-scale genetic structure in ev, allowing smaller, more practicable management units to be identified. Implications: genetic data can be used to identify management units for invasive species, which will be critical for the development of future management strategies and improving control operations. The approach outlined here could also be applied to improve the management of other introduced deer species in south-eastern australia.

174,2022,"Whole genome sequences from non-invasively collected caribou faecal samples","Conservation Genetics Resources","Conservation genomics is an important tool to manage threatened species under current biodiversity loss. Recent advances in sequencing technology mean that we can now use whole genomes to investigate demographic history, local adaptation, inbreeding, and more in unprecedented detail. However, for many rare and elusive species only non-invasive samples such as faeces can be obtained, making it difficult to take advantage of whole genome data. We present a method to extract dna from the mucosal layer of faecal samples to re-sequence high coverage whole genomes using standard laboratory techniques. We use wild collected faecal pellets collected from caribou (rangifer tarandus), a species undergoing declines in many parts of its range in canada and subject to comprehensive conservation and population monitoring measures. We compare four faecal genomes to two tissue genomes sequenced in the same run. Quality metrics were similar between faecal and tissue samples with the main difference being the alignment success of raw reads to the reference genome due to differences in low quality and endogenous dna content, affecting overall coverage. One of our faecal genomes was only re-sequenced at low coverage (1.6â ã), however the other three obtained between 7 and 15â ã, compared to 19 and 25â ã for the tissue samples. We successfully re-sequenced high-quality whole genomes from faecal dna and are one of the first to obtain genome-wide data from wildlife faecal dna in a non-primate species. Our work represents an important advancement for non-invasive conservation genomics.

175,2022,"Contrasting effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance on activity and species richness of insectivorous bats in neotropical dry forest","Frontiers In Ecology And Evolution","For prioritizing conservation actions, it is vital to understand how ecologically diverse species respond to environmental change caused by human activity. This is particularly necessary considering that chronic human disturbance is a threat to biodiversity worldwide. Depending on how species tolerate and adapt to such disturbance, ecological integrity and ecosystem services will be more or less affected. Bats are a species-rich and functionally diverse group, with important roles in ecosystems, and are therefore recognized as a good model group for assessing the impact of environmental change. Their populations have decreased in several regions, especially in the tropics, and are threatened by increasing human disturbance. Using passive acoustic monitoring, we assessed how the species-rich aerial insectivorous batsâessential for insect suppression servicesârespond to chronic human disturbance in the caatinga dry forests of brazil, an area potentially harboring ca. 100 bat species (nearly 50% are insectivorous), but with > 60% its area composed of anthropogenic ecosystems under chronic pressure. Acoustic data for bat activity was collected at research sites with varying amounts of chronic human disturbance (e.g., livestock grazing and firewood gathering). The intensity of the disturbance is indicated by the global multi-metric cad index (gmdi). Using animal sound identifier (asi) software, we identified 18 different bat taxon units. Using hierarchical modeling of species communities (hmsc), we found trends in the association of the disturbance gradient with species richness and bat activity: species richness was higher at sites with higher human disturbance, whereas bat activity decreased with increasing human disturbance. Additionally, we observed taxon-specific responses to human disturbance. We conclude that the effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance on the insectivorous bat fauna in the caatinga are not homogeneous and a species-specific approach is necessary when assessing the responses of local bats to human disturbances in tropical dry forests, and in other biomes under human pressure.

176,2022,"An assessment of economic viability of the ascension island tuna longline fishery management: implications for marine protected area planning and future fisheries management","Frontiers In Marine Science","The designation of large scale marine protected areas (mpas) has increased in recent years to address global issues such as biodiversity loss and the conservation of vulnerable marine habitats. While designing a large scale mpas in the exclusive economic zone (eez) of ascension island, the monitoring and enforcement costs were estimated for the two options under consideration: partial closure or full closure of the eez for the international commercial fleet. It was found that number of licenses to be sold to the international fleet to allow them access to the eez of ascension island would need to be increased to fund the monitoring and enforcement cost in case of a partial closure of the eez of ascension island. In this study, the future economic viability of the licensed big eye tuna fishery was addressed. The study explored economic drivers thought to be linked to license sales. It was shown that cost of licenses had not caused the observed decline in license sales but a shift in consumer demand toward lighter tuna species resulted in a decrease in japanese imports for bigeye tuna (thunnus obesus). This change in demand led to global changes in fishing effort and a drop in demand for licenses to fish within the ascension island eez. This study provided a valuable insight into the economic viability of the bigeye tuna fishery within the ascension island eez which informed the subsequent decision to close the bigeye tuna fishery as part of the designation of an ascension island highly protected large-scale mpa.

177,2022,"Increases in subsistence farming due to land reform have negligible impact on bird communities in zimbabwe","Ecology And Evolution","Habitat alterations resulting from land-use change are major drivers of global biodiversity losses. In africa, these threats are especially severe. For instance, demand to convert land into agricultural uses is leading to increasing areas of drylands in southern and central africa being transformed for agriculture. In zimbabwe, a land reform programme provided an opportunity to study the biodiversity response to abrupt habitat modification in part of a 91,000â ha dryland area of semi-natural savannah used since 1930 for low-level cattle ranching. Small-scale subsistence farms were created during 2001â2002 in 65,000â ha of this area, with ranching continuing in the remaining unchanged area. We measured the compositions of bird communities in farmed and ranched land over 8â years, commencing one decade after subsistence farms were established. Over the study period, repeated counts were made along the same 45 transects to assess species' population changes that may have resulted from trait-filtering responses to habitat disturbance. In 2012, avian species' richness was substantially higher (+8.8%) in the farmland bird community than in the unmodified ranched area. Temporal trends over the study period showed increased species' richness in the ranched area (+12.3%) and farmland (+6.8%). There were increased abundances in birds of most sizes, and in all feeding guilds. New species did not add new functional traits, and no species with distinctive traits were lost in either area. As a result, species' diversity reduced, and functional redundancy increased by 6.8% in ranched land. By 2020, two decades after part of the ranched savannah was converted into farmland, the compositions of the two bird communities had both changed and became more similar. The broadly benign impact on birds of land conversion into subsistence farms is attributed to the relatively low level of agricultural activity in the farmland and the large regional pool of nonspecialist bird species.

178,2022,"Bird assemblages in coffee agroforestry systems and other human modified habitats in indonesia","Biology","Deforestation in the tropics is mainly driven by the need to expand agriculture and forestry land. Tropical cropland has also undergone a process of intensification, particularly evident in regions that are the main exporters of deforestation-driven commodities. Around 25 million people in the world depend on coffee production, which has a profound contribution to global biodiversity loss through agricultural extensification and intensification. Nevertheless, coffee agroforestry systems have been postulated to serve as an alternative refuge for biodiversity across different regions. We aim to compare bird abundance, diversity, and richness in commercial polyculture coffee systems (i.e., the highest degree of habitat complexity that can be achieved in coffee fields after deforestation) with other coffee agroforestry systems and human modified habitats in java, indonesia. We collected data in 21 sites (1228 points) on java from february to august 2021 using the point sampling method. Via generalised additive models, we tested whether the abundance, diversity, and richness of birds were different between different human modified habitats including other potential predictors such as elevation, distance to protected areas, shade tree richness, and plant diversity. Using the non-metric multidimensional scaling, we tested whether there was a difference in terms of the composition of foraging guilds between habitats. Commercial polyculture coffee fields can sustain levels of bird abundance, diversity, and richness comparable to agroforestry systems under natural forest, and higher than sun coffee and shaded monoculture coffee, and of other human modified habitats such as crop/fruit fields and tree farms. Coffee agroforestry systems have a higher proportion of nectarivores, insectivores, and frugivores than other systems that can sustain high diversity and richness of birds such as paddy fields that mainly have granivores and carnivores. Complex polycultures can represent an avenue for the future of sustainable agriculture in conditions where deforestation rates are high and in crops such as coffee, which maintain high yield in the presence of diverse shade.

179,2022,"Principal drivers and conservation solutions to the impending primate extinction crisis: introduction to the special issue","International Journal Of Primatology","Nonhuman primates are facing an impending extinction crisis with over 65% of species listed as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered, and 93% characterized by declining populations. Primary drivers of primate population decline include deforestation, principally for industrial agriculture and the production of food and nonfood commodities, much of which is exported to wealthy consumer nations, unsustainable bushmeat hunting, the illegal pet trade, the capture of primates for body parts, expanding road and rail networks, mining, dam building, oil and gas exploration, and the threat of emerging diseases. Over the next several decades, human population increase, agricultural expansion, and climate change are expected to contribute significantly to the loss of additional suitable habitat and a reduction in the viability of local primate populations. If we are to avoid this impending extinction crisis, primate researchers must prioritize projects designed to mitigate the effects of habitat change on ecosystems health and biodiversity, and play a greater role in conservation and environmental policy by educating global citizens and political leaders. In addition, the international community will need to work with governments in primate habitat countries to expand the number of protected areas that contain primate species (94 primate species have < 10% of their range in protected areas). In this special issue of the international journal of primatology, we bring together researchers from a wide range of disciplines to examine the current and future threats to primate population persistence, and present local, country, and regional solutions to protect primate species.

180,2022,"Article diversity monitoring of coexisting birds in urban forests by integrating spectrograms and object-based image analysis","Forests","In the context of rapid urbanization, urban foresters are actively seeking management monitoring programs that address the challenges of urban biodiversity loss. Passive acoustic monitoring (pam) has attracted attention because it allows for the collection of data passively, objectively, and continuously across large areas and for extended periods. However, it continues to be a difficult subject due to the massive amount of information that audio recordings contain. Most existing automated analysis methods have limitations in their application in urban areas, with unclear ecological relevance and efficacy. To better support urban forest biodiversity monitoring, we present a novel methodology for automatically extracting bird vocalizations from spectrograms of field audio recordings, integrating object-based classification. We applied this approach to acoustic data from an urban forest in beijing and achieved an accuracy of 93.55% (â±4.78%) in vocalization recognition while requiring less than 1/8 of the time needed for traditional inspection. The difference in efficiency would become more significant as the data size increases because object-based classification allows for batch processing of spectrograms. Using the extracted vocalizations, a series of acoustic and morphological features of bird-vocalization syllables (syllable feature metrics, sfms) could be calculated to better quantify acoustic events and describe the soundscape. A significant correlation between the sfms and biodiversity indices was found, with 57% of the variance in species richness, 41% in shannonâs diversity index and 38% in simpsonâs diversity index being explained by sfms. Therefore, our proposed method provides an effective complementary tool to existing automated methods for long-term urban forest biodiversity monitoring and conservation. Â© 2022 by the authors.

181,2022,"Comparison of habitat suitability and connectivity modelling for three carnivores of conservation concern in an iranian montane landscape","Landscape Ecology","Context: habitat loss and fragmentation are main drivers of biodiversity loss and are occurring at an accelerating rate globally. Carnivores are often subject to persecution and conflict with humans, typically reside in low densities and require large areas for core habitat and dispersal, which makes them especially vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Objectives: this paper identifies, maps and analyses habitat core areas and connectivity linkages for three mountain-residing carnivore species of high conservation importance in iran: persian leopard (panthera pardus saxicolor), eurasian lynx (lynx lynx) and pallasâs cat (otocolobus manul). Methods: we used ensemble habitat suitability modeling, and compared the accuracy of ensemble models with seven separate models based on auc and tss. We applied resistant kernel and factorial least-cost path analyses to identify population core areas and corridors across the full distributions of the three species in iran. Results: mean annual temperature, vegetation greenness (ndvi), and slope were among the most important predictor variables for all three species. We found ensemble modeling outcompeted all single-method models in terms of auc. We found low overlap between predicted corridor locations of our modeled species with protected areas. Conclusions: given the fragmented populations of our studied species in iran, conserving them will require integrated landscape-level management to protect corridors and enhance connectivity, especially outside of protected areas. Optimized landscape management to conserve these species will likely promote conservation of montane landscapes and their inhabitants in iran.

182,2022,"Variable vulnerability to climate change in new zealand lizards","Journal Of Biogeography","Aim: the primary drivers of species and population extirpations have been habitat loss, overexploitation and invasive species, but human-mediated climate change is expected to be a major driver in future. To minimise biodiversity loss, conservation managers should identify species vulnerable to climate change and prioritise their protection. Here, we estimate climatic suitability for two species-rich taxonomic groups, then use phylogenetic analyses to assess vulnerability to climate change. Location: aotearoa new zealand (nz). Taxa: nz lizards: diplodactylid geckos and eugongylinae skinks. Methods: we built correlative species distribution models (sdms) for nz geckos and skinks to estimate climatic suitability under current climate and 2070 future climate scenarios. We then used bayesian phylogenetic mixed models (bpmms) to assess vulnerability for both groups with predictor variables for life-history traits (body size and activity phase) and current distribution (elevation and latitude). We explored two scenarios: an unlimited dispersal scenario, where projections track climate, and a no-dispersal scenario, where projections are restricted to areas currently identified as suitable. Results: sdms projected vulnerability to climate change for most modelled lizards. For species' ranges projected to decline in climatically suitable areas, average decreases were between 42% and 46% for geckos and 33% and 52% for skinks, although area did increase or remain stable for a minority of species. For the no-dispersal scenario, the average decrease for geckos was 37%â52% and for skinks was 33%â52%. Our bpmms showed phylogenetic signal in climate change vulnerability for both groups, with elevation increasing vulnerability for geckos, and body size reducing vulnerability for skinks. Main conclusions: new zealand lizards showed variable vulnerability to climate change, with most species' ranges predicted to decrease. For species whose suitable climatic space is projected to disappear from within their current range, managed relocation could be considered to establish populations in regions that will be suitable under future climates.

In the marine realm, one of the major threats to species conservation, together with climate change, is overfishing. In this context, having information on the conservation status of target commercial marine fish species becomes crucial for assuring safe standards. We put together fisheries statistics from the fao, the iucn red list, fishbase, and ram legacy databases to understand to what extent top commercial speciesâ conservation status has been assessed. Levels of assessment for top-fished species were higher than those for general commercial or highly commercial species, but almost half of the species have outdated assessments. We found no relation between iucn red list traits and fishbase vulnerability index, depreciating the latter value as a guidance for extinction threat. The ram database suggests good management of more-threatened species in recent decades, but more data are required to assess whether the trend has reverted in recent years. Outdated iucn red list assessments can benefit from reputed stock assessments for new reassessments. The future of iucn red list evaluations for commercial fish species relies on integrating new parameters from fisheries sources and improved collaboration with fisheries stakeholders and managers.

184,2022,"Aquatic invasion patterns across the north atlantic","Global Change Biology","Biological invasions are a major driver of biodiversity loss and socioeconomic burden globally. As invasion rates accelerate worldwide, understanding past invasion dynamics is essential to inform predictions of future invaders and impacts. Owing to a high diversity of pathways and current biosecurity gaps, aquatic systems near urban centres are especially susceptible to alien species establishments. Here, we compiled and compared alien species lists for three different aquatic recipient regions spanning the north atlantic: chesapeake bay, great lakes-st. Lawrence river and north and baltic seas. Each system is a major trade centre, with a history of invasions, and characterized by a strong natural salinity gradient. Our goal was to compare the alien species across systems, to test for similarities in the taxonomic composition and geographic origin as well as species overlap among the three regions. We selected specific macroinvertebrate, algal and fish taxa for analysis, to control for uneven taxonomic and biogeographic resolution across regions. Cumulatively, we identified 326 individual alien species established in these aquatic systems, with the north and baltic seas most invaded overall (163), followed by great lakes-st. Lawrence river (84) and chesapeake bay (79). Most invasions were from ponto-caspian, eurasian, northwest pacific, northwest atlantic and north american origins, and mostly comprised arthropoda, chordata, mollusca and annelida. However, origins and taxonomies differed significantly among destinations, with ponto-caspian species particularly successful invaders to the north and baltic seas then great lakes-st. Lawrence river, but less so to chesapeake bay. Nevertheless, approximately eight-tenths of invaders established in only one region, indicating disparate invasion patterns and a high potential for future aliens to accrue from increasingly diverse source pools and pathways. These results support biosecurity strategies that consider a broad range of geographic origins and taxonomic groups to limit the translocation, arrival and spread of alien species worldwide.

185,2022,"Herbivore grazing mitigates the negative effects of nitrogen deposition on soil organic carbon in low-diversity grassland","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Changes in soil carbon (c) sequestration in grassland ecosystems have important impacts on the global c cycle. As such, it is important that researchers better understand the underlying mechanisms affecting soil c. Increasing evidence has shown that atmospheric nitrogen (n) deposition can cause dramatic changes in grassland soil c. It remains unclear whether herbivore grazing, a primary means to manage and utilize grassland resources, can regulate the effects of n deposition on soil c, and whether these effects are dependent on plant community diversity. Here, we examined the joint effects of herbivore grazing and n-addition on soil organic c (soc) stocks in two types of communities with low and high plant diversity respectively. Our results showed that the effects of n-addition and its combination with herbivore grazing on grassland soc were inconsistent in the two types of communities. In the low-diversity community, n-addition greatly decreased soc stocks, while grazing significantly increased it. Additionally, the grazing-induced increase in soil c stocks in the presence of n-addition was so great that it completely counteracted the significant decline in soc induced by n-addition. However, in the high-diversity community, we observed no effects of n-addition on soc and grazing increased soc only in the absence of n-addition and had no significant effect in the presence of n-addition. Synthesis and applications. Our study suggests that increased n deposition can trigger a remarkable reduction in soil c sequestration in grasslands with low plant diversity, but that herbivore grazing can offset this decline, which may help to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions caused by atmospheric n deposition. As a result, we suggest that moderate herbivore grazing should be considered as an effective grassland management measure for maintaining and improving grassland soil c sequestration as the increasing global changes such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, n deposition and biodiversity losses threat.

186,2022,"Bats provide a critical ecosystem service by consuming a large diversity of agricultural pest insects","Agriculture, Ecosystems And Environment","Biodiversity directly influences the delivery of multiple ecosystem services, most notably within agriculture. Projected future global demands for food, fiber and bioenergy will require enhancement of agricultural productivity, but favoring biodiversity-based ecosystem services generally remains underutilized in agricultural practice. In addition, agricultural intensification is a key driver of biodiversity loss. A significant obstacle preventing the adoption of ecologically sensitive practices is a lack of knowledge of the species delivering the services. Insectivorous bats have long been suggested to regulate insect pest populations and may be a critical component of biodiversity-based ecosystem services. Bats may also serve as agents of insect pest surveillance through environmental dna (edna) monitoring approaches. However, the biological and economic importance of bats to agriculture remains under-quantified. Here we catalogued the dietary niche of two north american bats, little brown bat (myotis lucifugus) and big brown bat (eptesicus fuscus), through dna metabarcoding of guano collected from seven roosting sites over a 26-week period. We measured the frequency of occurrence of known pest species in guano samples, compared interspecific differences in diet, and examined seasonal patterns in prey selection. Overall, we detected 653 unique prey species, 160 of which were known agricultural pests or disease vectors. Species diversity of prey species consumed varied by bat species and across the season, with big brown bats accounting for the majority of arthropod diversity detected. However, little brown bats consumed relatively more aquatic insects than big brown bats, suggesting that increased bat species richness in a landscape can amplify their net pest regulation service. Further, we hypothesized that detection probabilities of target insect pests would be higher in guano samples than in conventional survey methods. Multi-survey occupancy modeling revealed significantly lower detectability in bat guano than in conventional monitoring traps, however, highlighting important tradeoffs in selection of survey methods. Overall, the results presented here contribute to a growing evidence base supporting the role bats play in the provisioning of biodiversity-based ecosystem services.

As the climate and anthropogenic-related impacts on marine systems accelerate, biodiversity knowledge integration is urgently required to evaluate and monitor marine ecosystems and to support suitable responses to underpin a sustainable future. The census of marine life (coml, 2000â2010) was the largest global research program on marine biodiversity. A decade after, and coinciding with the steep increase of digitalization of our society, we review existing findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (fair) biodiversity data coming from one of the most reliable online information systems: the global biodiversity information facility (gbif). We evaluate the completeness of available datasets with respect to the coml benchmark, along with progresses in understanding spatialâtemporal patterns of marine biodiversity in the european seas in the last decades. Overall, we observe severe biases in available biodiversity data toward the north-western marine regions (particularly around the united kingdom and the north sea), the most recent years (with a peak in the number of reported occurrences in the 2010s) and the most conspicuous, abundant, and likely âappealingâ taxa (e.g., crustaceans, echinoderms or fish). These biases may hamper research applications, but also global-scale data needs and integrative assessments required to support cost-effective progresses toward global biodiversity conservation. National to international joint efforts aimed at enhancing data acquisition and mobilization from poorly known regions, periods, and taxa are desirable if we aim to address these potential biases for the effective monitoring of marine ecosystems and the evaluation of ongoing impacts on biogeographic patterns and ecosystem functioning and services.

189,2022,"Marginal farmers carry the burden of damage caused by asian elephants elephas maximus in bardiya national park, nepal","Oryx","In areas where farmland borders protected areas, wildlife may be attracted to crops and cause substantial financial damage for farmers. Elephants, in particular, can destroy a year's harvest in a single night, and can also cause damage to buildings and other farm structures. Few studies have examined whether damage caused by wild elephants increases social inequalities in farmer communities. We interviewed settlement leaders and subsistence rice farmers living in the buffer zone of bardiya national park, nepal, to examine (1) the variation and spatial distribution of wealth within the farmer community, (2) the severity and spatio-temporal distribution of damage inflicted by asian elephants elephas maximus, and (3) the willingness to insure against such damage. We investigated whether particular societal strata are disproportionally affected by negative interactions with elephants. We found that farmers near the boundary between agricultural and wilderness areas were significantly poorer and had smaller landholdings than those further into the cultivated lands. Concomitantly, damage to crops and houses was more frequent nearer the wilderness-agriculture boundary than further away from it. Hence, in the buffer zone of bardiya national park, farmers near the wilderness-cultivation boundary, with small landholdings, had a relatively higher cost of elephant damage, yet were less willing to pay for an insurance scheme. We infer that in areas where both social inequality and damage caused by wildlife are spatially structured, conservation success may cause economic hardship for the local community, particularly for the poorer class. We discuss causes of the current lack of communal mitigation measures against the damage caused by elephants in the park, and potential solutions. Â© the author(s), 2021.

190,2022,"Taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity of bird assemblages in urban green spaces: null model analyses, temporal variation and ecological drivers","Frontiers In Ecology And Evolution","Urban expansion is a pervasive driver of biodiversity loss. To understand the effects of urbanization on diversity, we investigated the response of bird taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity to urban green spacesâ characteristics in thirty-one green spaces of mexico city. Selected sites encompassed variation of environmental factors along a transformation gradient, from natural protected areas to landscaped parks. Bird observations were conducted during winter (non-breeding season), spring (dry breeding season), and summer (wet breeding season). We used multi-model inference to assess the relationship of green space area, shape, isolation, tree richness, habitat diversity, and vegetation cover with species richness, faithâs phylogenetic diversity, and functional richness. We calculated standardized effect sizes from null models to assess phylogenetic and functional structure. We registered 91 species belonging to 28 families across all sites and seasons. The number of detected species was largest in winter and decreased toward the dry breeding season, and then toward the wet breeding season. We found a moderate to strong positive relationship of species richness with phylogenetic diversity and functional richness. Overall, phylogenetic and functional structure of bird communities in green spaces was neither clustered nor over-dispersed. However, few cases of functional clustering, phylogenetic clustering, or both were observed, and they corresponded to natural protected areas. Results showed a predominant role of green space area in determining community diversity and phylogenetic structure while it did not influence functional structure. Contrary to our predictions, habitat diversity had a negative effect on species richness and phylogenetic diversity and this effect was detected only during the wet breeding season, whereas isolation showed a positive relationship with phylogenetic and functional structure, during the wet breeding season and winter, respectively. This study emphasizes the use of complementary measures of diversity together with the comparison between observed and expected values to get a better insight into the mechanisms by which green spacesâ characteristics affect bird diversity across the seasons.

191,2022,"Integrating local perspectives into conservation could facilitate human-crocodile coexistence in the ayeyarwady delta, myanmar","Oryx","Conservation will always fail when it does not address the drivers of biodiversity loss, which in many cases involves understanding human behaviours and the attitudes that underlie them. The saltwater crocodile crocodylus porosus is a keystone species in mangrove wetlands but also a dangerous predator that affects people's safety and livelihoods. Although saltwater crocodiles are protected under the myanmar biodiversity and protected area law, the government has not integrated local people's attitudes into conservation and management. As a consequence, saltwater crocodiles, although categorized as least concern on the iucn red list, are restricted to a single protected area, meinmahlakyun wildlife sanctuary, in myanmar. To examine local attitudes towards the species, we investigated local knowledge about the environment, crocodiles, habitats and threats, awareness of human-crocodile conflict, and perceptions of the benefits and impacts of saltwater crocodile conservation through questionnaires in 244 households in 17 villages. We found that people were highly knowledgeable about the local environment, saltwater crocodiles, and their habitats. People with seasonal livelihoods that rely on natural resources from meinmahlakyun had negative attitudes towards crocodile conservation. People were likely to have negative attitudes if they perceived there were no benefits from conserving the species. Law enforcement through restricting resource access does not enhance conservation success and builds resentment towards the conservation of the species. Local people suggested that, as a basis for management, understanding risks posed by crocodiles was the best approach to facilitate human-crocodile coexistence in the ayeyarwady delta region.

192,2022,"National edna-based monitoring of batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and amphibian species in norway","Metabarcoding And Metagenomics","Freshwaters represent the most threatened environments with regard to biodiversity loss and, therefore, there is a need for national monitoring programs to effectively document species distribution and evaluate potential risks for vulnerable species. The monitoring of species for effective management practices is, however, challenged by insufficient data acquisition when using traditional methods. Here we present the application of environmental dna (edna) metabarcoding of amphibians in combination with quantitative pcr (qpcr) assays for an invasive pathogenic chytrid species (batrachochytrium dendrobatidis -bd), a potential threat to endemic and endangered amphibian species. Statistical comparison of amphibian species detection using either traditional or edna-based approaches showed weak correspondence. By tracking the distribution of bd over three years, we concluded that the risk for amphibian extinction is low since bd was only detected at five sites where multiple amphibians were present over the sampled years. Our results show that edna-based detection can be used for simultaneous monitoring of amphibian diversity and the presence of amphibian pathogens at the national level in order to assess potential species extinction risks and establish effective management practices. As such our study represents suggestions for a national monitoring program based on edna. Â© 2022 the authors.

To clarify whether habitat desertification causes shifts in life history strategies, we compared ecological factors and reproductive traits of phr ynocephalus przewalskii from three different desertification habitats â fixed dune, semi-fixed dune and mobile dune of a semi-arid region of inner mongolia, at the eastern edge of hobq desert, china. Our results showed a significant shift in the egg size-number trade-off of p. Przewalskii in response to desertification, with lizards from the mobile dune habitat producing smaller clutches of larger eggs than lizards from the fixed and semi-fixed dune habitats. This life history shift is likely adaptive and driven by abiotic factors (temperature and precipitation) rather than biotic factors (food availability and lizard population density). Our study demonstrates that habitat desertification drives the shift in egg size-number trade-off in a lizard and highlights the importance of exploring the life history responses of animals to habitat desertification as well as to other traditionally well-studied factors like temperature, especially in the context of future global climate change.

Even so, studies focused on road ecology are still very scarce for many regions of the country. The present study aimed to monitor the mortality of wild vertebrates on the federal highway br-235, in sergipe (brazil), and analyze possible seasonal variations in roadkill rates. Between august 2020 and july 2021, two samples were taken per month in a stretch of 20 km of the br-235, traveled by motorcycle at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h. Seventy-five individuals of 30 vertebrate species were recorded. The roadkill rate was 0.156 individuals per kilometer covered. The most recorded classes were birds with 29 individuals (13 spp.) And mammals with 23 individuals (10 spp.). The species with the highest number of records was rhinella sp. With 16 records (21.6%), coragyps atratus with eight records (10.8%) and didelphis albiventris with seven records (9.4%). Among the species recorded, two are threatened with extinction (leopardus tigrinus and puma yagouaroundi). A greater number of roadkill was registered in the rainy season. The results reveal this stretch of br-235 as a source of continuous mortality for the regionâs fauna. Â© 2022, universidade federal do rio de janeiro.

In this brief commentary, we develop a new conceptual lens that brings together cutting-edge theories of political ecology and green criminology. We apply this to the european iwt context, to deconstruct the power dynamics and inequalities that underlie environmental harms caused by green-collar crime. We use the dynamics of illegal trade in brown bears, eels and songbirds as illustrative examples, and consider three cross-cutting issues that shape the trade: consumption, uncertain scientific knowledge and legislative frameworks.

196,2022,"The introduction of three cryptic tree frog species in the dutch coastal dunes challenges conservation paradigms","Amphibia Reptilia","Invasive species are considered one of the main drivers of the sixth mass extinction. Conservation solutions depend on whether a species is also indigenous to the country it invades (i.e., beyond its native range). In the case of invasive cryptic species, genetic tools are required to establish their identity. We illustrate these issues with the human-mediated colonization of the dutch coastal dunes by hyla tree frogs. Although previously assumed to concern the indigenous common tree frog h. Arborea, european tree frogs comprise a complex of allopatric cryptic species, meaning the taxonomic identity of introduced dutch populations warrants investigation. We sequence mtdna for 173 individuals from native and introduced populations across the netherlands and compare our dataset with hundreds of hyla haplotypes previously barcoded in the western palearctic. Two of the dune populations carry an mtdna haplotype of the native species h. Arborea that occurs naturally elsewhere in the netherlands. In contrast, mtdna assigned to the eastern tree frog h. Orientalis was detected in all three other dune populations. In one of these populations mtdna of the italian tree frog h. Intermedia was also found. Not one, but three species of tree frogs have thus been introduced to the dutch coastal dunes, only one of them being native to the netherlands. This situation causes a conservation conundrum as some introduced populations are lawfully protected but could pose a threat to local biodiversity. Regarding the ã trueã exotic tree frog species, all conservation options should be considered.

197,2022,"Fox and cat responses to fox baiting intensity, rainfall and prey abundance in the upper warren, western australia","Wildlife Research","Context: invasive predators are major drivers of global biodiversity loss. Red foxes (vulpes vulpes) and feral cats (felis catus) have contributed to the decline and extinction of many native species in australia. The deployment of poison baits to control fox populations is a widespread conservation tool, but the effects of baiting intensity, rainfall and prey abundance on baiting effectiveness remain poorly understood. Aims: we aimed to understand what influences the association between fox baiting intensity, red fox activity and feral cat activity, to provide inferences about what might affect the effectiveness of fox baiting in reducing fox activity. Methods: we used generalised linear models to assess how fox and cat activity changes in relation to fox baiting intensity, rainfall, native prey availability and distance to agricultural land over a 6-year period (2006-13) in the forest ecosystems of the upper warren region of south-western australia. Key results: we found that fox activity was negatively associated with rainfall in the previous 12 months and positively associated with prey abundance and fox baiting intensity. We also found an interaction between fox baiting and prey abundance, with fox activity increasing with prey activity in areas of low and moderate baiting intensity, but remaining constant in areas of high baiting intensity. Feral cat activity was positively associated with prey abundance and fox baiting intensity. We found no clear relationship between fox and cat activity. Conclusions: the drivers of the association between fox baiting and fox activity are unclear because intense fox baiting was targeted at areas of known high fox abundance. However, our results indicate that intense fox baiting may be effective at decoupling the positive association between fox activity and prey abundance. Our results also suggest a positive association between fox baiting intensity and feral cat activity, thus supporting the case for integrated fox and cat management. Implications: we caution interpretation of our results, but note that management of invasive predators could be improved by adjusting the intensity of management in response to changes in environmental conditions and local context (e.g. Strategically conducting intense predator management where prey abundance is highest). Improved understanding of these associations requires a monitoring program with sufficient replication and statistical power to detect any treatment effects. Â© 2022 csiro.

198,2022,"Vegetation cover and configuration drive reptile species distributions in a fragmented landscape","Wildlife Research","Context: habitat loss and fragmentation are key drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide, yet the influence of landscape structure on species distributions is unknown. Globally, reptiles are thought to be especially sensitive to landscape modification due to their limited capacity for dispersal and reliance on native vegetation. New knowledge of how landscape structure influences species distributions is needed to inform conservation strategies. Aims: our principal aim was to examine the influence of landscape structure on the distributions of 40 terrestrial reptile species in victoria, southeast australia. Methods: we obtained species occurrence records from the victorian biodiversity atlas, and used maxent to model the distributions of reptile species within victoria using biophysical and landscape structure variables. A moving window analysis was applied to a land cover map to derive five landscape structure metrics; two metrics represented landscape cover and three represented landscape configuration. Key results: climate variables were generally found to be the strongest drivers of species distributions, although 80% of reptile species were also influenced by landscape structure (permutation importance â¥5%). Of the five landscape structure variables, extent of native vegetation had the greatest influence (30 of 40 species), followed by habitat shape. For lerista bougainvillii and tiliqua rugosa, native vegetation cover had a greater influence on their distributions than climate variables. Most species responded positively to native vegetation extent, whereas responses to other landscape structure variables were varied. Conclusions: although most studies of reptile distributions only use biophysical variables in modelling, our research shows that at the scale of our study area, reptile species distributions were also influenced by landscape structure; extent of native vegetation was an important predictor for most species. Integrating landscape structure in modelling has the potential to improve our ability to predict species distributions. Implications: because species distributions are likely to shift due to climate change, knowledge of the influence of landscape structure on distributions will help land managers to facilitate successful range expansions in fragmented landscapes. Our findings indicate that management focused on increasing the extent of native vegetation is likely to provide benefit to most reptile species. Â© 2022 csiro.

Herein, we investigated whether abiotic factors are related to changes in fruit availability that can lead to changes in feeding behavior and, consequently, in endoparasite load and general health status in two groups of golden-headed lion tamarins (leontopithecus chrysomelas) living in degraded fragments of atlantic forest in southern bahia, brazil. We detected that there was a high variation in availability of ripe fruits throughout the year, with lower availability occurring at the end of spring and beginning of summer. Despite this, there was no difference in tamarinsâ general health status, body mass and blood counts between seasons. This is probably because during native fruit scarcity, the tamarins eat cultivated species, such as banana (musa spp.) And jackfruit (artocarpus heterophyllus). Temperature and daylength were negatively correlated with golden-headed lion tamarin endoparasite loads. Contrary to our expectations, endoparasite loads are not linked to fruit scarcity and consequent changes in feeding behavior. Nevertheless, we found higher parasite diversity in the group of golden-headed lion tamarins that occupied the smallest home range. The smaller the area available, the greater the contact with parasites the animal will have, as they are forced to travel constantly along the same routes in the forest, increasing infection risk and re-infection rates. Our results highlight how animalsâ health is associated with environmental health as well as the need for constant monitoring to ensure the effective conservation of endangered species, such as the golden-headed lion tamarin.

Itâs goal is to achieve no net loss (nnl), and preferably a net gain of biodiversity attributes between development and offset sites. Biodiversity offsetting suffers from a lack of âproof of conceptâ, as little work has been done to critically test the ecological efficacy of offsetting practices. Offsetting of stream ecological functions was investigated in aotearoa new zealand, via review of regulatory documentation for 76 offsets and field assessments of 14 offset sites. Field results indicated some functions, including fish passage connectivity, respond rapidly post-offset enhancement whilst others exhibit recovery lags (such as fish spawning habitat provision). However, most offsets were considered unlikely to achieve nnl due to failures in practice and process. Factors included inadequate consideration for restoration uncertainty, inappropriate monitoring conditions, insufficient data and inequivalent trade-offs. Key linkages between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, particularly regarding floodplain connectivity, were poorly considered in offset implementation. Thus, development may be occurring based on inadequate regulatory processes, and poorly evaluated ecological outcomes. These findings join a growing body of evidence which indicates that, in the context of a global biodiversity crisis, offsetting is not achieving its purpose of nnl.

In this context, biodiversity hotspots represent priority targets for conservation in amphibian populations. However, little information is available on the distribution and conservation status of amphibian species within most biodiversity hotspots. Here, we characterized the distribution and conservation status of four threatened endemic amphibians (bombina pachypus, salamandra salamandra gigliolii, salamandrina terdigitata, and rana italica) in the aspromonte mountain region, a biodiversity hotspot in southern italy where the conservation status of amphibians is almost unexplored. We conducted an intensive field survey of 507 potential breeding sites spanning over 2,326 km2. We found that all four species were widespread in the study area. We observed 337 species occurrences: 63 for s. S. Gigliolii, 29 for s. Terdigitata, 84 for b. Pachypus, and 161 for r. Italica. Species distribution analysis revealed that s. S. Gigliolii and r. Italica populations had an extended and homogenous distribution. Conversely, s. Terdigitata showed a dispersed pattern, with long distances among breeding sites, and b. Pachypus an aggregated pattern, associated with the availability of suitable artificial habitats. On the other hand, we reported a decrease in b. Pachypus occurrence in its natural habitats, which reflects a negative trend of its populations. Overall, our results provide an encouraging framework for the conservation of amphibian populations in this area, but highlight the low coverage of threatened amphibian populations in protected areas, highlighting the need for a reassessment of conservation policies and spatial conservation planning for the aspromonte region.

In the philippines, the philippine integrated disease surveillance and response (pidsr) framework outlines the monitoring, response, and management of disease outbreaks, but needs to be updated in the wake of zoonoses from iwt. Here, we identified zoonotic pathogens that may be introduced to human populations through the iwt, pinpointed potential outbreak hotspots, and provided recommendations on how to improve the philippinesâ public health response while considering one health. Using seizure data from the biodiversity management bureau (denr-bmb) covering the period from 2010 to 2016, we found that birds (32.3% of volume) and reptiles (63.3% of volume) were the most frequently seized by law enforcement in terms of incidence and volume. About 54% of seized wildlife could potentially host zoonotic pathogens with bacteria (78.3%), protozoa (34.8%), and viruses (27.5%) being the most represented pathogen groups. Three cities in metro manila together accounted for 30% of all seizures in the country followed by palawan province which accounted for about 28% of seizures. Of the twelve epidemic prone diseases identified in the pidsr, five diseases were found to have causative agents that could potentially be hosted by the traded wildlife.

203,2022,"Landscape -scale predictors of persistence of an urban stock dove columba oenas population","Urban Ecosystems","While a few species may thrive in urban areas, urban expansion is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Columbids such as feral rock doves (columba livia domestica) and common woodpigeon (columba palumbus) have adapted extremely well to the urban environment in europe and beyond, but the stock dove (columba oenas), a bird of farmland and woodland edge in the uk and of national conservation concern, is encountered infrequently in urban areas. Here we explore the multi-scale landscape associations of the little-studied stock dove within the urban matrix of greater manchester, uk, in order to identify its habitat requirements. We built a pilot model from historical citizen science records to identify potentially occupied sites within the city, and then surveyed these sites for stock dove during spring 2019. We combined the survey results with citizen science records from the same period and described the habitat and landscape characteristics of sites occupied by stock dove using four variables at different scales plus twelve unscaled variables. We used a three-stage random forest approach to identify a subset of these variables for interpretation and a subset for prediction for the presence of stock dove within these sites. Key variables for predicting stock dove presence were their relative abundance in the landscape immediately beyond the core urban area, the greenness (ndvi) of the environment around sites, and the canopy cover of individual trees over 20â m high within sites. Stock doves tended to be associated with habitats with more surface water during the non-breeding season than the breeding season. Our results highlight the importance of large trees within urban greenspace for this cavity-nesting species, softer boundaries around urban sites for stock doves and stock dove presence in nearby areas. While stock dove share many traits with species that are successful in the urban environment, they remain relatively poor urban adapters.

Understanding the ecology of species and how species respond to habitat alterations is basic knowledge needed to develop conservation programmes and address issues of biodiversity loss. All five species of tiger geckos (goniurosaurus) in vietnam are known to be threatened by extinction due to anthropogenic impacts such as habitat degradation and harvesting for the international pet trade. However, conservation actions have only been initiated for the better-studied species. This study provides detailed basic data on microhabitat use of two allopatric sister species, namely goniurosaurus huuliensis and g. Luii. In total, 145 geckos (including 59 records of g. Huuliensis and 86 records of g. Luii) were observed during field surveys. All goniurosaurus individuals were mostly recorded in the forest on karst formations, covered with evergreen broad-leaved woody trees, intermixed with ferns, shrubs and vines. Microhabitats of the two species were relatively similar in other traits, such as high vegetation coverage, high humidity, stable ambient temperature and dry-rock substrates. A multiple factor analysis supported that the ecological niche spaces of the two species highly overlap, even though their distribution ranges are geographically separated. We further found no intraspecific niche segregation in both species. The present data provide baseline knowledge for both in situ and ex situ conservation measures to protect species in the genus goniurosaurus.

206,2022,"College squirrels gone wild? Using sciurus carolinensis behavior to assess the ecosystem value of urban green spaces","Urban Ecosystems","Predicted rapid increases in urbanization in the face of accelerating biodiversity loss underscores the need for urban development that promotes, rather than displaces, native plants and animals. One approach for increasing urban biodiversity is through the development of âgreen infrastructureâ. Although research has explored urban-rural gradients and the overall value of urban green infrastructure, few studies have investigated the habitat value for wildlife of different types of urban greenspace. Here, we use a well-established metric in ecology, giving up-densities (guds), to compare foraging costs for a common urban wildlife species, the eastern gray squirrel (sciurus carolinensis), among three green infrastructure categories: municipal parks, college campuses, and residential yards. We found that guds for gray squirrels did not differ significantly among location categories after controlling for proximity to roads, but proximity to roads was associated with significantly higher guds in all locations. In an explicit test, we also found that both proximity to roads and traffic volume were associated with higher guds. We also found that maximum distance from roads was significantly higher for campuses and parks than for residential yards, indicating a greater proportion of the area of campuses and parks is âaway from roadsâ compared to residential yards. Our results indicate that vehicle traffic may contribute significantly to an âurban landscape of fearâ for gray squirrels and suggest that campus and park configurations that reduce road effects could improve habitat quality for squirrels and possibly other animals.

207,2022,"Assessing the representation of species included within the canadian living planet index","Facets","To effectively combat the biodiversity crisis, we need ambitious targets and reliable indicators to accurately track trends and measure conservation impact. In canada, the living planet index (lpi) has been adapted to produce a national indicator by both world wildlife fund-canada (canadian living planet index; c-lpi) and environment and climate change canada (canadian species index) to provide insight into the status of canadian wildlife, by evaluating temporal trends in vertebrate population abundance. The indicator includes data for just over 50% of canadian vertebrate species. To assess whether the current dataset is representative of the distribution of life history characteristics of canadian wildlife, we analyzed the representation of species-specific biotic variables (i.e., body size, trophic level, lifespan) for vertebrates within the c-lpi compared to native vertebrates lacking lpi data. Generally, there was considerable overlap in the distribution of biotic variables for species in the c-lpi compared to native canadian vertebrate species lacking lpi data. Nevertheless, some differences among distributions were found, driven in large part by discrepancy in the representation of fishesâwhere the c-lpi included larger-bodied and longer-lived species. We provide recommendations for targeted data collection and additional analyses to further strengthen the applicability, accuracy, and representativity of biodiversity indicators.

In this context, sandy beach macrobenthic species are highly vulnerable due to anthropogenic impacts and global changes. Evaluating and monitoring life history-based biological traits is a key goal for ecologists to investigate biodiversity and ecosystem functioning changes. Due to environmental conditions, however, life-history traits may vary among regions, even for similar taxa. The south atlantic coast is highly under-sampled compared with north atlantic regions. Here, we investigate the life cycle, population dynamics, and reproductive biology of the key species atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis (dana, 1853) from a southwestern atlantic coast sandy beach. We followed field time-series data of multiple life-cycle-based biological traits. The body length of a. Brasiliensis varied from 1.25 to 11.86â mm. Longevity was estimated at 11.9â months for both males and females. Growth parameters were estimated as lââ =â 12.9â mm, kâ =â 2.3, t0â =â â0.10 for males and lââ =â 12.3, kâ =â 2, t0â =â â0.13 for females. The population showed continuous reproduction and multiple cohorts without seasonality. The mean sex ratio was female-biased (1.71: 1).

The creation and establishment of protected areas serve as tools for guaranteeing biodiversity conservation. In this study, we examined the diversity of medium- and large-sized mammals and flightless walking birds that are supported by a protected area system, the ischigualastoâtalampaya system, and its area of influence. We set up 106 camera traps and analysed all data with rankâabundance curves and hill numbers as a measure of diversity. Species richness was lower in protected areas, unlike in the buffer zone, due to the absence of domestic species. Native species were present all over the area, but with variations in their abundances, showing that the presence of domestic species in low densities would not negatively affect the richness of native species, but would indeed affect their abundance.

210,2022,"The potential of frogging as an ecotourism product for south african national parks","Koedoe","Amid global biodiversity loss, it is important to find practical tools and solutions in order to protect biodiversity. Ecotourism is the fastest-growing sector of the international travel industry and can be a powerful conservation tool that encourages people to protect the natural environment. Traditionally, frogs have not generated much attention among ecotourists, partly because they are easily overshadowed by other more charismatic species or habitat attractions. With almost a third of the nearly 7000 known amphibian species listed as threatened by the international union for conservation of nature (iucn), their protection is crucial. Frogging is a well-known term within the frog conservation society, describing the activity of searching for frogs in the wild. This can be combined with other ecotourism activities to attract tourists and create an interest in the conservation of frogs while having fun at the same time. The aim was to determine the ecotourism potential of frogs in south africa, primarily by distributing questionnaires to tourists to retrieve information on whether they would be interested in participating in frog-related ecotourism activities within the south african national parks. For this research, a quantitative research approach was followed, namely non-probability sampling, to which convenience sampling was applied. An online survey (questionnaire) was designed to collect the data for the research. The survey outcome was satisfactory, as potential tourists indicated that they would like to participate in frog-related activities. The project offers the opportunity to conserve frogs, educate tourists, and create job opportunities within the local communities. It will also create a new tourism product for the south african national parks. Conservation implications: the contribution of this research to conservation lies in the opportunity to benefit frog conservation through ecotourism. Â© 2022.

Successful application of mpas will be predicated on the ability to monitor biodiversity in a synoptic and noninvasive manner. Environmental dna (edna) methods have important advantages over traditional biodiversity survey methods for monitoring conservation areas. To evaluate the efficacy of edna metabarcoding for fish biodiversity monitoring, we sampled 19 coastal eelgrass (zostera marina) beds in canada, as eelgrass beds are known for high biodiversity and significant conservation value. At each site, beach seines were used to survey fish and water samples were collected contemporaneously for edna metabarcoding. In total, beach seining caught 32 672 individuals across 59 fish taxa, and edna detected 129 fish taxa. Edna captured site-level variation and detected higher species richness at both site and regional levels compared to seining. Edna abundance had a positive association with capture abundance. Collectively these results highlight how edna metabarcoding offers an efficient approach for monitoring fish biodiversity in coastal eelgrass beds, thus providing a valuable and noninvasive tool for mpa planning and coastal monitoring.

212,2022,"Can financialization save nature? The case of endangered species*","Contemporary Accounting Research","The current biodiversity loss is dramatic. Over the past 50 years, more than 68% of the mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish on earth have disappeared, putting the planet's survival and its inhabitantsâincluding human beingsâat risk. Financialization, or the transformation of nature into financial assets, is increasingly proposed as a solution to the biodiversity crisis. Proponents of financialization believe that assigning a monetary value to nature will incentivize human beings to protect habitats and their species. This article offers a four-mechanism model of nature's financialization, explaining why it is virtually impossible to financialize nature. We collected data through a unique two-stage data collection process, including a single case study and additional interviews with conservationists and conservation finance specialists. We analyzed the development of a calculative device, the âindex,â designed to assess the impact of conservation efforts on the survival of endangered species. Conservationists hoped to use the index to calculate the financial return of a conservation impact bond, a financial instrument designed to finance conservation projects. However, they did not achieve their goal. We discuss the implications for the financialization and conservation literature and the role of accounting therein. We notably question previous accounts of financialization, including the need for financial numbers or financial actors. We ultimately show that a financialization project can transform practices toward financialization, even if the financialization process is not complete.

213,2022,"Threats at home? Assessing the potential ecological impacts and risks of commonly traded pet fishes","Neobiota","Invasive alien species (ias) are major drivers of global biodiversity loss, and the poorly regulated international pet trade is a source of emerging and future invaders. Predictions of the likely ecological impacts and risks of such ias have been significantly enhanced in recent years with new metrics, which require application to many more actual and potential ias. Hence, this study assesses the potential ecological impacts and risks of two readily available pet trade species: goldfish, carassius auratus, a species with non-native populations worldwide; and white cloud mountain minnow, tanichthys albonubes, a species with a limited invasion history to date. First, we compared the per capita feeding rates of these non-native species with two european trophically analogous natives â the stone loach, barbatula barbatula, and the common minnow, phoxinus phoxinus â using the comparative functional response method. Second, we used foraging experiments in conspecific pairs to determine synergistic, neutral or antagonistic intraspecific interactions. Third, we performed novel object experiments using the two pet trade species to assess boldness, a known âdispersal enhancing traitâ. Goldfish had the highest maximum feeding rates of the four species, while white cloud mountain minnows had the lowest. Neutral interactions were observed for all four species in the paired foraging experiments, with goldfish having the highest consumption and white cloud mountain minnows having the lowest. Goldfish demonstrated greater boldness, being more active during the experimental trials and more likely to approach a novel object than white cloud mountain minnows. Further, combining maximum feeding rates, boldness and species availabilities from our survey of pet shops, we assessed the relative invasion risks (rir) of the two non-natives. This highlighted goldfish as the higher risk and most worthy of management prioritisation, mirroring its more extensive invasion history. We propose that such metrics have potential to direct future ias policy decisions and management towards the ever-increasing rates of biological invasions worldwide. Â© copyright james w. E.

However, we show that in sea turtles, a reduction in the mean size of breeding individuals may be part of the good news story of an expanding population. We describe a 70-fold increase in annual nest numbers on the island of sal (cape verde, north atlantic) between 2008 and 2020 (from 506 to 35 507 nests), making this now one of the largest loggerhead (caretta caretta) nesting aggregations in the world. We use 20 128 measurements of the size of nesting turtles to show that their mean annual size has decreased by about 2.4 cm, from 83.2 to 80.8 cm. This decrease in the mean size of nesting turtles was not caused by the removal of larger turtles, for example by selective harvesting. Rather we develop a theoretical model to show than this decrease in mean size can be explained by an influx of first-time nesters, combined with a decrease in the size of those first-time nesters over time. A reduction in mean size of nesting turtles has been reported across the atlantic, pacific and indian oceans, and may be a common feature of population recoveries in sea turtles.

Host distributions are one critical component to identify areas at risk of viral spillover, and bats act as reservoirs of diverse viruses. We developed a reproducible ecological niche modelling pipeline for bat hosts of sars-like viruses (subgenus sarbecovirus), given that several closely related viruses have been discovered and sarbecovirus-host interactions have gained attention since sars-cov-2 emergence. We assessed sampling biases and modelled current distributions of bats based on climate and landscape relationships and project future scenarios for host hotspots. The most important predictors of species distributions were temperature seasonality and cave availability. We identified concentrated host hotspots in myanmar and projected range contractions for most species by 2100. Our projections indicate hotspots will shift east in southeast asia in locations greater than 2â°c hotter in a fossil-fuelled development future. Hotspot shifts have implications for conservation and public health, as loss of population connectivity can lead to local extinctions, and remaining hotspots may concentrate near human populations.

Thus, previous studies have raised concerns that environmental social movement organizations, as social change entrepreneurs, often fail to adequately make food an issue, especially animal-based foods, nor strongly advocate needed solutions, including shifting to plant-based diets. Building upon this, but specifically addressing the biodiversity crisis through a critical animal studies lens, we examine how seven international conservation organizations connect wildlife issues to human food production and consumption. Through a collective action framing analysis of social movement websites, we ascertain in what ways and to what extent these conservation organizations (1) recognize dietary choices, farming, and fishing as drivers of species loss and harm to animals, (2) suggest individual consumer solutions and systemic government and industry solutions (both voluntary and legally-mandated), and (3) appeal to motivational values that are not just anthropocentric, but also ecocentric and biocentric (showing concern for the welfare and rights of individual animals, human and nonhuman). We make strategic recommendations for including biocentric and interspecies justice perspectives in food advocacy messaging of conservation organizations to help stem the tide of mass extinction while cultivating greater respect for all types of animals.

218,2022,"Landscape alteration affects the demography of an endangered avian predator by reducing the habitat quality","Avian Research","Habitat transformation is identified as major threat to biodiversity loss globally, affecting threatened raptors. Changes in land use can alter the abundance and distribution of birds of prey by affecting habitat availability and quality. In this study, we used multivariate analyses to investigate the effect of habitat alteration on the demography of a declining eastern imperial eagle (aquila heliaca), making assumptions for future population trajectories. We used the generalized linear mixed models with poisson distribution and log link function, searching a relationship between the demographic parameters and the landscape structure and possible effects of fragmentation. In our study area, habitat change affected dramatically permanent grasslands, shrinking their availability. As we expected, the share of grasslands in eaglesâ territories significantly affected occupancy rate, but not productivity and breeding frequency. We found that occupancy rate decreased significantly, while productivity and breeding frequency showed no trend. Modeling the effect of habitat alteration on eastern imperial eagle demography, we found out that territory quality was a more powerful factor driving the response of a top predator to the alteration of favorite foraging habitats. Only the habitat quality in source territories had a significant positive effect on eagle productivity. We found that simple rules to predict adverse agricultural impact on territory abandonment or breeding productivity of a top predator were not reliable. Our results could be used for planning conservation of other large territorial raptors, facing the same type of threat.

219,2022,"Dietary shifts may underpin the recovery of a large carnivore population","Biology Letters","Supporting the recovery of large carnivores is a popular yet challenging endeavour. Estuarine crocodiles in australia are a large carnivore conservation success story, with the population having extensively recovered from past heavy exploitation. Here, we explored if dietary changes had accompanied this large population recovery by comparing the isotopes î13c and î15n in bones of crocodiles sampled 40 to 55 years ago (small population) with bones from contemporary individuals (large population). We found that î13c and î15n values were significantly lower in contemporary crocodiles than in the historical cohort, inferring a shift in prey preference away from marine and into terrestrial food webs. We propose that an increase in intraspecific competition within the recovering crocodile population, alongside an increased abundance of feral ungulates occupying the floodplains, may have resulted in the crocodile population shifting to feed predominantly upon terrestrial food sources. The number of feral pigs consumed to sustain and grow crocodile biomass may help suppress pig population growth and increase the flow of terrestrially derived nutrients into aquatic ecosystems. The study highlights the significance of prey availability in contributing to large carnivore population recovery. Â© 2022 royal society publishing.

220,2022,"Nutrient fertilization by dogs in peri-urban ecosystems","Ecological Solutions And Evidence","(Semi-)natural ecosystems provide many important benefits to nature and people, but are often located near populated and urbanized areas across the globe. During recreational activities, many people bring dogs into peri-urban forests and nature, but their nutrient inputs per unit space and time via dog faeces and urine into ecosystems remain scarcely quantified. Here, we estimate net fertilization rates of dogs in peri-urban ecosystems, with a focus on nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p) because of their evident effects on plant biodiversity. We used 487 direct-count censuses over 1.5â years to collect accurate dog abundance data per hectare per year in four sites in peri-urban forests and nature reserves in belgium. Based on estimated dog densities and a systematic literature search of nutrient concentrations in urine and faeces, we calculate n and p fertilization rates from urine and faeces deposits, also propagating uncertainty and variability in these estimates. We find that canine n and p fertilization rates on average amount to 11â kg n (more or less equally from urine and faeces) and 5â kg p (predominantly from faeces) per hectare per year, respectively. These estimated amounts are substantial when compared to atmospheric inputs of n and extractable amounts via traditional nature management (e.g. Mowing and hay removal). Our estimated dog n and p fertilization rates in peri-urban forests and nature are substantial. Such levels of nutrient inputs may considerably influence biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and co-determine restoration outcomes. Our results underpin the need for managers and policy makers to more often (i) consider currently neglected nutrient inputs by dogs in management plans and restoration goals, (ii) communicate to dog walkers the role of their dog as âfertilizerâ and highlight the necessity to remove at least canine solid faecal waste, (iii) in sensitive oligotrophic ecosystems with species adapted to nutrient-poor soils, establish nearby off-leash dog parks, enforce the use of short leashes and/or apply dog bans such that high dog abundances can be avoided.

221,2022,"An integrated climate-biodiversity framework to improve planning and policy: an application to wildlife crossings and landscape connectivity","Ecology And Society","Planning and policy are best done through integrated approaches that holistically address multiple sustainability issues. Climate change and biodiversity loss are two of the most significant issues facing our planet. Accordingly, advancements in integrated sustainability planning and policy require a means for examining how certain strategies and actions may align or conflict with these sustainability imperatives. Here, we enhance the knowledge of integrated approaches for addressing sustainability challenges by developing and applying a framework for examining different planning and policy areas in the context of climate action and biodiversity conservation. As a case study, we used wildlife crossing planning and landscape connectivity policy in canada, which is currently piecemeal, fragmented, and could benefit from an integrated approach. The study was conducted in two stages. First, we developed an analytical framework for examining issues in the context of climate action and biodiversity conservation co-benefits and trade-offs. Then, we applied the framework to wildlife crossing and landscape connectivity issues to elucidate opportunities and challenges for integrated planning and policy. We used a literature review to develop an integrated climate-biodiversity framework (icbf). Icbf was subsequently applied to wildlife crossing and landscape connectivity planning and policies in canada. Icbf maps relationships between climate action and biodiversity conservation co-benefits and trade-offs and is organized into six themes: green space, transportation, green infrastructure, food and agriculture, energy, and land management. Applying icbf to participant interview data produced insights into opportunities and challenges for integrated approaches to wildlife crossing and landscape connectivity by elucidating potential co-benefits and trade-offs such as alignments between stormwater management and aquatic crossings (i.e., co-benefits) and potential issues related to energy development and habitat fragmentation (i.e., trade-offs). Icbf has application beyond wildlife crossings, and its continual use and refinement will result in a better understanding of how to effectively implement integrated approaches and transition toward sustainable development paths.

222,2022,"A present and future assessment of the effectiveness of existing reserves in preserving three critically endangered freshwater turtles in southeast asia and south asia","Frontiers Of Biogeography","Tortoises and freshwater turtles are among the most threatened taxa of vertebrates in the world due to consumption, urban development, agriculture, and land and water pollution. About 50% of the currently recognised chelonian species are considered threatened with extinction according to the iucn red list. Asia is an epicentre for the turtle and tortoise extinction crisis, containing the highest diversity of threatened species. In this study, we used species distribution models (sdms) to assess the effectiveness of existing protected areas across southeast and south asia for the conservation of three large critically endangered freshwater turtles (batagur borneoensis, b. Affinis, and pelochelys cantorii). We derived the models based on selected bioclimatic variables at the sites of known species records. Our sdms showed that indonesia is of particular importance in prioritising conservation for these three species, containing the largest areas of suitable habitat within protected areas. However, when considering water surface coverage, thailand has the highest proportion of suitable areas under protection. Our results suggest that the present cover of protected network reserves seems inadequate in terms of size and should be expanded to sustain populations of the three target species. Therefore, we identified priority areas and reserves critical for further field surveys to guide the potential discovery of novel populations. To investigate the effect of climate change, we also projected potential distributions onto ensembles of four ipcc story lines. As a result, we found larger extralimital areas of suitable environment for all three species, particularly northwards and inland.

Several strategies, such as the creation of protected areas (pas) and payment for ecosystem services have been adopted to mitigate the consequences of this biodiversity crisis. In rio verde, goiãs, brazil, a water producer program (wpp) was established, which provides payment for ecosystem services for the maintenance of riparian vegetation in the region of the ribeirão abãbora, a river which supplies the city and metropolitan area. In the absence of environmental diagnostic studies in the region, this present study contributes to reducing some knowledge gaps, through the: (i) characterization of the landscape in the wpp area, (ii) characterization of species of fauna (amphibians, birds, fish, and medium and large terrestrial mammals) and woody flora that occur in this area, and (iii) comparison of species diversity (fauna and flora) found in our study area with the diversity observed in the cerrado protected area network. Our results reveal a low native vegetation cover (~21% of total area), but we recorded 300 total species: 20 species of anuran amphibians, 100 birds, 10 fish, 16 terrestrial mammals (medium and large), and 154 woody plants. Our sample comprises species considered endemic to the cerrado (e.g., anuran-barycholos terntezi and mammal-callithrix penicillata), threatened species (e.g., mammals-herpailurus yagouaroundi, myrmecophaga tridactyla and tapirus terrestris), and exotic invasive species (mammal-sus scrofa). The results presented in this study are relevant and may help in the proposal of management actions within the scope of this important program of payment for environmental services.

To gain insights into the status of northern germanyâs otter population, 92 otters found dead in schleswig-holstein between 2015â2020 were collected and underwent detailed dissection with the aim to establish a monitoring program for this population. Examinations followed a protocol especially designed for otters, including various biological data assessments and extended sampling. The finding sites showed a clear concentration in the continental region. Seasonal concentration differed among the years, yet peaks were seen from fall to winter. Overall, more males than females were found, although this differed among the years. The majority of otters that could be aged were between 1â3 years. Placental scars and pregnancy were recorded in only few females. Nutritional status was good in most cases. Infectious diseases found included vagococcus lutrae, toxoplasma gondii, and emmonsia spp. A major cause of death was roadkill. Known sample bias in studies focusing on roadkill was considered in the finding interpretation.

226,2022,"Forest-cover change rather than climate change determined giant panda's population persistence","Biological Conservation","Climate and land-use change are two primary drivers of global biodiversity loss, which increase the risks of extinction for giant panda, an umbrella and one of the most heavily invested species in conservation. Understanding how giant panda responds to these environmental changes thus is critical for developing long-term effective conservation strategies. However, until now most studies focused on only the effects of either climate change or land-use change on giant panda. So, if the potential combined effects of these processes are greater than either of them, the current conservation recommendations would be inappropriate or misleading. Here, based on two national survey data on giant panda occurrences across nearly thirty years, we quantified the variation of giant panda's population persistence as a function of land-use (measured as forest-cover) change, climate (measured as annual mean temperature (mat), annual mean summer temperature (mast) and annual mean precipitation (map)) change, and the synergistic effect of land-use and climate change. We found forest-cover change explained 38.1% of giant panda's persistence variation, while climate change explained 20.1% of the variation, and the synergistic effect of land-use and climate change explained only 1.5% of the variation. We confirmed that forest-cover change surpassed climate change or the synergistic effect between them as the greatest force driving giant panda's population persistence. Our findings highlighted the urgent need for a more comprehensive understanding of the relative effects of climate change by integrating climate change and land-use change rather than just focusing on climate change in tackling global biodiversity loss.

227,2022,"Anticipating the potential impacts of batrachochytrium salamandrivorans on neotropical salamander diversity","Biotropica","Emergent infectious disease caused by the fungal pathogens batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd) and batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (bsal) represents one of the major causes of biodiversity loss in amphibians. While bd has affected amphibians worldwide, bsal remains restricted to asia and europe, but also could be a major threat for salamanders in the western hemisphere, including the 320 bolitoglossine species described. Here, we predict the suitable areas for bsal in the neotropics and assess its potential impact on bolitoglossine diversity. For this, we determined the geographic patterns of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity for bolitoglossines and modeled the potential distribution of bsal in the neotropics. We identified which species and regions could be at risk from an eventual introduction of bsal in the region, quantified the degree of overlap between regions of high diversity and the suitable conditions for the pathogen, and considered species iucn red list status, and geographic range size. We found that regions of high taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity are concentrated in the trans-mexican volcanic belt, sierra madre oriental, the southern portion of sierra madre del sur and the mountains of oaxaca in mãxico, as well as the chiapan-guatemalan highlands, and the cordilleras of costa rica and panama. Alarmingly, the regions of high diversity for bolitoglossines and over 75% of the ranges of the more threatened species could be affected by bsal. Given the unknown vulnerability of these species, we strongly recommend measures to avoid the introduction of bsal in the continent. Abstract in spanish is available with online material.

228,2022,"Turning old foes into new alliesâharnessing drainage canals for biodiversity conservation in a desiccated european lowland region","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Drainage canals are widespread components of agricultural landscapes. Although canals have greatly contributed to biodiversity loss by desiccating wetlands, they have recently attracted conservation attention due to their potential to function as refugia for native species in intensively managed landscapes. However, their conservation role in complex landscapes composed of agricultural fields and desiccated but otherwise untransformed, semi-natural habitats, on which canals still pose a heavy burden, is unknown. Improved understanding of drainage canals and related biodiversity in these landscapes could help unlock their potential and support synergistic land management for nature conservation and water resource management. We applied a multi-taxon approach, including plants, butterflies, true bugs, spiders and birds, to (a) assess the conservation value of drainage canals with temporary water cover in a heavily drained european lowland region, (b) to test landscape-level and local canal parameters for aiding prioritization among canals and (c) to propose a reconciliation-based management framework that suits the interest of all stakeholders. We found that drainage canals and their banks concentrate more species across most taxa than semi-natural, mostly grassland habitats, possibly due to micro-environmental heterogeneity and the absence of low-intensity annual management compared to grasslands. Canals traversing semi-natural grasslands concentrate particularly high numbers of native species, but agricultural canals also support remarkable species richness. However, agricultural canals are important dispersal corridors for non-native invasive plants, which may negatively affect native biodiversity. Canal size has little effect on biodiversity, but habitat stress is an important determinant. The higher the stress (due to sandiness and salinity), the higher the added value of canals to landscape-wide biodiversity. Synthesis and applications. We show that drainage canals can harbour high biodiversity and should therefore be recognized as important novel ecosystems with high conservation value, even when cutting through semi-natural grassland habitats. Canals have previously been considered detrimental to nature conservation due to their association with loss of wetlands. However, by reducing water loss with reversible obstructions, controlling invasive species and applying specific conservation measures, they may be turned into conservation allies without compromising long-term interests of water management and agricultural land use.

229,2022,"Forest loss and fragmentation can promote the crowding effect in a forest-specialist primate","Landscape Ecology","Context: forest loss and fragmentation are rapidly expanding across the tropics. Although forest loss is a major driver of the current biodiversity crisis, the effect of fragmentation remains debated, particularly for forest-specialist species. Objectives: we evaluated the univariate and combined effect of forest loss (percent of forest cover) and fragmentation (forest patch density) on populations of a forest-specialist primate, the black-fronted titi monkey (callicebus nigrifrons), in the landscapes from a transitional zone between atlantic forest and cerrado biomes. Methods: we surveyed titi monkey density in 14 landscapes. Using a multiscale and multimodel inference approach, we tested the relative effect of each landscape variable assessed at their respective scales of effect on titi monkey density. Results: titi monkey density ranged from 0 to 12 groups/km2 and was best predicted by the combined effect of forest cover and patch density. Density increased in forest patches embedded in more deforested and fragmented landscapes. Interestingly, the effect of forest patch density was consistently positive along the entire evaluated forest cover gradient (9â42%). Conclusions: our findings support that fragmentation per se can have positive effects on biodiversity, in this case, by increasing the likelihood that more individuals can be ârescuedâ from deforestation and crowded in the remaining forest patches. Although the long-term consequences of living crowded in forest patches are unknown, a conservative approach for preserving this (and potentially other) forest-specialist species could be to promote forest restoration projects focused on increasing the number and/or size of forest patches in the landscape (i.e., reverse fragmentation).

The current study aimed to evaluate whether a puzzle feeder suspended and baited with different items could promote increased foraging and general activity in tamarins living in a zoo setting. A pair of tamarins at woodland park zoo received the puzzle feeder in three conditions in an abcacb experimental reversal design over a period of three months: an empty feeder and feeders baited with either fruit (raisins) or insects (mealworms). Food type affected behavior; time spent climbing increased when the feeder contained insects compared to fruit. Subjects interacted with the baited puzzle feeder device significantly more than the empty feeder, and use was highest within the first 30 minutes of exposure. Our results suggest that the puzzle feeders plus food were effective in increasing foraging and general activity.

231,2021,"History, status, and productivity of the red-crowned amazon amazona viridigenalis in the lower rio grande valley of texas","Bird Conservation International","Newly established populations of endangered species can help mitigate declines elsewhere and can be a valuable genetic reservoir. When these populations are located within anthropogenic habitats, they may also help mitigate the potential biodiversity loss created by urbanization. The red-crowned amazon amazona viridigenalis is an endangered species that has become naturalized in multiple urban areas throughout the united states and mexico, and these populations may currently outnumber the population within their historical habitat. While these urban populations may hold the majority of this endangered species, very few studies have analyzed the status and trends of this species, or of threatened parrots in general, in urban areas. Our study focuses on an urban red-crowned amazon population in the lower rio grande valley (lrgv) of texas: the only parrot population currently recognized as native to the united states. To determine a timeline of red-crowned amazon arrival and growth in the lrgv, we reviewed published literature and online citizen science databases. To quantify current population levels and trends, we conducted 412 surveys at all known roost sites throughout the lrgv from january 2016 through april 2019. We also quantified the ratio of adult and juvenile parrots at roosts. Our data suggest the species has been present in the lrgv consistently since the 1970s and showed rapid growth from the mid-1990s through roughly 2016. Roost counts suggest there is currently a minimum lrgv population of about 680 and the population has been relatively stable over the last 3.5 years. Productivity averaged 19% over three breeding seasons, suggesting successful internal reproduction. This study provides important baseline information for the management and conservation of red-crowned amazons in the region and provides a valuable timeline on the beginnings and trends of this recently established urban population of amazona parrot.

Historically, ravens have received special attention in human culture, being either respected or vilified. In the western united states, ravens are exploiting the expanding human enterprise, which provides them with unintended subsidies of food, water, and breeding locations, allowing ravens to expand their range and increase in population density and resulting in raven depredation threatening species of conservation concern. From a conservation biology perspective, increased raven populations present a difficult challenge in managing humanâwildlife conflict. Some raven control measures are effective empirically but present ethical dilemmas, are economically expensive, or are socially divisive. Current studies seek to better understand raven population dynamics in relation to human land use and to identify socially acceptable ways to ameliorate raven impacts on biodiversity in the american west. The purpose of this paper is to provide readers with summaries of important constraints in the search for how to address deleterious effects of an expanding raven population. Specifically, i describe ethical, legal, social, and biological constraints in relation to calls for lethal control of ravens. Despite these constraints, a conservation strategy may emerge through modeling the relationship between raven presence and reproduction of sensitive prey species, and developing a clearer understanding of raven ecology.

233,2021,"Frugivorous bats promote epizoochoric seed dispersal and seedling survival in a disturbed neotropical forest","Journal Of Mammalogy","Animal-dispersed plants usually rely upon multiple dispersers. In many ecosystems, most of these interactions have yet to be explored; thus, documenting the extent of contribution of each animal partner to the reproduction and survival of plant species is key to understanding the ecology and evolution of animal-plant mutualism, as well as the potential responses of the ecological networks to biodiversity loss through defaunation. Here, by characterizing the outcomes and differences of the epizoochoric seed dispersal carried out by two species of frugivorous bats (artibeus phaeotis and uroderma convexum) in a neotropical forest, we tested the prediction that, through their feeding activity, both bat species disperse and influence the subsequent seedling survival of multiple seed species. By direct sampling on bats' dispersing sites and surrounding areas, we found evidence of the dispersal of 2,310 seeds of eight plant species, of which 118 survived to become seedlings. The total density of seeds and the seedling survival were significantly higher in areas directly influenced by the bats (i.e., feeding roosts) than in peripheral areas. Positive density-dependent effects nevertheless were detected in both sampling areas (feeding roosts and peripheral areas). Interspecific comparisons showed that despite both bat species having similar dispersal outcomes, seedlings in peripheral areas related to a. Phaeotis have better survival rates. Our results demonstrate that both bat species primarily disperse by epizoochoric means seeds of various tree species at several localities in the study site. This result, together with the positive density-dependent effects, suggests that bats are moving seeds away from maternal trees and depositing them in locations where some of the seeds can germinate, establish, and survive, thereby highlighting the positive contribution of these bat species to the reproductive success of trees inhabiting neotropical habitats. Our results contribute to the growing knowledge of frugivorous interactions on hyperdiverse forests and the role of small vertebrates on seed dispersal mutualisms.

The changes in flow regimes in lithuanian lowland rivers due to the operation of hydropower plants (hpps) and the impact of altered flow on some fish species have already been studied. The impact of climate change on future natural river runoff and the structure of fish assemblages was also investigated. However, it is still unknown how the combined effect of climate change and flow regulation related to hydropower generation may affect fish assemblages in the downstream river reaches below the lithuanian hpps. In this study, the physical habitat modelling system mesohabsim was used to simulate spatial and temporal changes in aquatic habitats availability for different fish species under the influence of hpp at different climate change scenarios. Changes in the available habitat were assessed for common fish species in four hpp-affected rivers representing different hydrological regions of lithuania. The modelling results showed that the operation of hpp under climate change conditions in most rivers could be beneficial for small benthic fish species such as gudgeon gobio gobio and stone loach barbatula barbatula. Meanwhile, for larger fish species (e.g., chub squalius cephalus and vimba vimba vimba) the alteration in the temporal availability of suitable habitat was relatively higher. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Here we tested the efficacy of genotyping-in-thousands by sequencing (gt-seq) for collecting targeted single nucleotide polymorphism genotypic data from archival scale samples, and applied this approachâ to a study of kokanee salmon (oncorhynchus nerka) in kluane national park and reserve (knpr; yukon, canada) that underwent a severe 12-year population decline followed by a rapid rebound.

We observed slight decreases in expected heterozygosity, allelic diversity, and effective population size post-crash, but none were significant, suggesting genetic diversity was retained despite the severe demographic contraction. Genotypic data also revealed the genetic distinctiveness of a now extirpated population just outside of knpr, revealing biodiversity loss at the northern edge of the species distribution.

After, the reintroductions carried out two decades ago are currently thriving in the danube river basin. Using nine nssr markers, we analysed samples from 98 individuals, and we found no genetic substructure, suggesting high dispersal and gene flow capabilities. The stepwise mutation model (smm) indicated the existence of a recent genetic bottleneck, though the eurasian beaver retains high levels of genetic diversity and population growth facilitated variation in nssr loci. A fine-scale spatial correlation in females was detected, contrasting with malesâ dispersal on longer distances. While the movement and establishment of individualsâ new territories were made under natural predation pressure, the mix following natural expansion improved the fitness and could contribute to a higher genetic diversity than the source population. With any reintroduction, a focus on capturing individuals from various geographic origins, as well as securing many and suitable founding individuals (adults, subadults, and juveniles) with mixed origins, could secure the post-genetic bottleneck recovery and higher genetic diversity. Beyond this conservation success, future management strategies should consider building a national action plan (nap) for the species, including a permanent genetic monitoring programme for eurasian beaver.

Achieving biodiversity-sensitive cities is challenging, especially in regions threatened by growing urbanization. To inform urban management and planning in a global biodiversity hotspot, we conducted a multi-scale assessment of drivers of neotropical birds in the capital city of santiago de chile. We investigate the influence of local and landscape variables on native bird species richness and abundance. We surveyed birds and vegetation in 449 sampling points distributed across the city. Native bird species richness was greater in areas with greater shrub and woody vegetation cover at the local scale. Native bird species richness was also greater with high vegetation density in the surrounding landscape and near to an urban boundary. Native birds were abundant in areas with large woody vegetation cover at both local and landscape scales, high vegetation density in the surrounding landscape, near to an urban park and near to an urban boundary. Additive effects of vegetation at different spatial scales suggest that combining local and landscape management, planning and design will be best to preserve native birds in a large city. Although native birds are species rich and abundant near the urban fringe and decrease towards the interior of the city, local-scale management of habitat encouraging shrub and tree planting and landscape-scale actions such as targeting high levels of vegetation (including woody cover) and providing a well-distributed network of urban parks will help sustain native birds across the city. Greening actions at local and landscape-scale will contribute to achieving biodiversity-sensitive cities, providing benefits for people and nature.

241,2021,"Hunting techniques and their harvest as indicators of mammal diversity and threat in northern angola","European Journal Of Wildlife Research","Over-exploitation of wildlife especially bushmeat trade is the second most important threat to animal biodiversity. This also applies to northern angola but data on bushmeat and hunting techniques for this region are rare. Therefore, we study the most common hunting techniques, frequently captured species, and their economic value, and discuss the local resource use in relation to angolan law and urgent global crises like the loss of biodiversity, the food supply in south african countries, and the risk of zoonoses. We recorded bushmeat hunting in 27 localities in the province of uãge, accompanied hunters along their snare lines and interviewed additional 20 locals. Seven main types of snares and traps and their characteristics were defined. Hunters own on average 92 â± 128.7 snares and traps and capture about 25.3 â± 23.6 animals monthly. In total, respondents recognized 28 species of mammals of which one is considered as extinct and two as very rare. The majority of recorded species are hunted regularly. Rodents are most commonly caught followed by primates and duikers. Harvesting rates decrease with speciesâ body size, leading to high economic value of and achievable prices for rare, large animals. Overall, our results document the hunting pressure on mammals and the persisting popularity of bushmeat in northern angola which poses an imminent threat to remaining mammal populations. Moreover, it endangers ecosystem integrity, rural livelihoods, and human health through the risk of new zoonoses. Our findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable solutions. The angolan government should play a more active role in enforcing existing hunting legislation to reduce illegal bushmeat trade.

242,2021,"Resource utilisation by smooth-coated otter in the rivers of himalayan foothills in uttarakhand, india","Global Ecology And Conservation","Conservation depends on acquiring timely knowledge on speciesâ ecology to alleviate the risks of biodiversity loss driven by anthropogenic stressors. Himalayan freshwater ecosystems are exceedingly threatened by the compounding effects of rising developmental pressure and climate change, jeopardizing biodiversity nested within this imperilled landscape. Riverine ecosystems of the himalayan foothill forests of india are a stronghold of the vulnerable smooth-coated otter populations. This study entails the understanding of resource utilisation by the smooth-coated otter (lutrogale perspicillata) in terms of habitat use and dietary composition in seven rivers along the himalayan foothills in india. We surveyed 121.09 km of rivers for otter signs and associated habitat variables. Using generalised linear models, we assessed the factors influencing otter habitat use. We estimated the relative abundance and catch per unit effort of fish species and evaluated otter diet based on spraint samples (n = 120) using frequency of occurrence and score-bulk estimate methods. Habitat use by otters is governed by a combination of habitat components, which are intricately linked to different requirements such as feeding, grooming, and denning. We found that habitat use was positively associated with channel depth, moderate vegetation, and bank substrate types â bedrock, boulders, sand, and grass. Whereas, increasing distance to escape cover, sparse vegetation, channel width, and anthropogenic disturbance negatively influenced habitat use. Dietary analyses revealed that relatively abundant fish species viz., tor putitora and barilius vagra, predominated the diet of otters. Echoing the principles of optimal foraging theory, our results indicated that small-medium sized fishes of the size range 79.05â199.92 mm, were consumed more often, and larger fishes (> 263.24 mm) were consumed opportunistically. Our findings provide important conservation insights on the status of the smooth-coated otter, their interactions with different habitat components, and dietary spectrum in rivers of the himalayan foothills. Overall, our study gives cognizance to the importance of preserving freshwater and riparian habitats to ensure the persistence of otters and their prey in the region.

This study aims to establish the baseline situation of avian diversity and abundance on various land uses including the landfill at gujranwala in northeastern punjab, pakistan, and understanding the impact of urban solid waste in changing bird behavior. Field observations in a variety of land uses (agriculture, forest, lake, urban and landfill) in summer 2018 using the point count method for bird census determined the baseline for 56 species (birds/10 min) indicating a significant change in native avian composition. Pca analysis showed four clusters based on the nature of habitat and species behavior. Agriculture land was found to be the highest (h'= 3.394) and landfill the lowest (h'= 1.414) in biodiversity. However, landfill site registered the most number of birds (>9000). Among twenty species recorded at the landfill, four species viz., house crow, common myna, grey-throated martin and bank myna, recorded >95% of the total population of birds. Species evenness was the highest for lake site (e= 0.938) indicating the most balanced type of ecosystem. Sparrows were found only in urban areas. Two opportunist species (house crow and common myna) were found to be the most successful in exploiting available resources. Foraging of birds in layers with aggressive species feeding first and development of new learning mechanisms pointed to the change in bird behavior at the landfill. This work highlights the need for a new research field 'landfill ecology' to study the impact of landfill on biota including avian, in a time when biodiversity loss is the hottest global issue.

244,2021,"Composition of âfastâslowâ traits drives avian community stability over north america","Functional Ecology","Rapid biodiversity loss has triggered decades of research on the relationships between biodiversity and community stability. Recent studies highlighted the importance of species traits for understanding biodiversityâstability relationships. The species with high growth rates (âfastâ species) are expected to be less resistant to environmental stress but recover faster if disturbed; in contrast, the species with slow growth rates (âslowâ species) can be more resistant but recover more slowly if disturbed. Such a âfastâslowâ trait continuum provides a new perspective for understanding community stability, but its validity has mainly been examined in plant communities. Here, we investigate how âfastâslowâ trait composition, together with species richness and environmental factors, regulate avian community stability at a continental scale. We used bird population records from the north american breeding bird survey during 1988â2017 and defined avian community stability as the temporal invariability of total community biomass. We calculated species richness and the communityâweighted mean (cwm) and functional diversity (fd) of four key life-history traits, including body size, nestling period (i.e. Period of egg incubation and young bird fledging), life span and clutch size (i.e. Annual total number of eggs). Environmental factors included temperature, precipitation and leaf area index (lai). Our analyses showed that avian community stability was mainly driven by the cwm of the âfastâslowâ trait. Communities dominated by âfastâ species (i.e. Species with small body size, short nestling period and life span and large clutch size) were more stable than those dominated by âslowâ species (i.e. Species with large body size, long nestling period and life span and small clutch size). Species richness and the fd of the âfastâslowâ trait explained much smaller proportions of variation in avian community stability. Temperature had direct positive effects on avian community stability, while precipitation and leaf area index affected community stability indirectly by influencing species richness and trait composition. Our study demonstrates that composition of âfastâslowâ traits is the major biotic driver of avian community stability over north america. Temperature is the most important abiotic factor, but its effect is weaker than that of the âfastâslowâ trait. An integrated framework combining âfastâslowâ trait composition and temperature is needed to understand the response of avian communities in a changing environment.

245,2021,"Spatially restricted occurrence and low abundance as key tools for conservation of critically endangered large antelope in west african savannah","Scientific Reports","The effective conservation of mammals on the brink of extinction requires an integrated socio-ecological approach, yet the updated ecological knowledge of species remains fundamental. This study brings spatiotemporal behaviour, population structure, age-specific survival rates, and population size estimate of the western derby eland (wde) in the niokolo koba national park (nknp), senegal, investigated during dry seasons 2017 and 2018. Wde was strongly localised in the core area of nknp (< 5%), active throughout the day with the highest peak in the hottest daytime, with a mean group size 7.6 â± se 8.9. The adult sex ratio was female-biased and showed low annual adult male survival rates. The population consisted of high proportion of juveniles, whilst adults did not exceed 40%. The estimated population density was 0.138 wde/km2 (â± 0.0102) and estimated size 195 wde in nknp (ci95 from 54 to 708 individuals). Findings highlighted that the wde population has potential to expand in the nknp, due to an underutilized capacity. The age-specific vital rates indicate adult males as the most vulnerable; suggesting either an increase in the large predatorsâ population, livestock encroachment pressure, and/or poaching. Findings imply that targeted monitoring with science-based interpretation may bring forward strong conservation solutions to the protected area management decision-makers.

246,2021,"Alternative food sources interfere with removal of a fungal amphibian pathogen by zooplankton","Journal Of Applied Ecology","While the amphibian disease chytridiomycosis is causing ongoing population declines and biodiversity losses around the globe, efficient mitigation strategies are lacking. The free-living zoospores of the causative agents of this disease, the chytrid pathogens batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd) and batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (bsal), are a potential food source for filter-feeding micropredators as part of the aquatic food web. While consumption of zoospores can lower environmental pathogen loads, alternative food sources may interfere with pathogen removal rates. We compared the ability of three filter-feeding zooplankton species, the cladoceran daphnia magna, the rotifer brachionus calyciflorus and the ostracod heterocypris incongruens, to remove bd zoospores in water and investigated the effect of alternative food sources, the green algae pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and chlorella vulgaris, on zoospore ingestion by d. Magna. Daphnia magna was the only micropredator candidate that effectively removed bd zoospores from its environment, with an average removal rate of 1,012â â±â 542 geâ ind.â1â hrâ1 within our test system. High concentrations (1â ãâ 105â cells/ml) of large and easily ingestible p. Subcapitata reduced pathogen removal rates, whereas the small and less edible c. Vulgaris did not interfere with pathogen removal. Synthesis and applications. We showed that daphnia spp., which are keystone species in all sorts of aquatic habitats worldwide, are promising target agents for biologically mitigating chytridiomycosis infections and how natural food sources may interfere with this strategy. We also suggest potential management actions for biological disease mitigation, aiming to optimize environmental conditions for these target filter feeders, thereby reducing pathogen densities and eventually infection pressure in amphibian hosts. Examples of such management actions include, but are not limited to, removal of planktivorous fish, habitat restoration, nutrient control or agrochemical regulation in the vicinity of amphibian breeding ponds. Further studies, including field trials, are needed to confirm the effects of pathogen consumption on infection dynamics in natural situations and investigate the impact of intervention actions.

247,2021,"Public health and economic benefits of spotted hyenas crocuta crocuta in a peri-urban system","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Species that depend on anthropogenic waste for food can remove pathogens that pose health risks to humans and livestock, thereby saving lives and money. Quantifying these benefits is rare, yet can lead to innovative conservation solutions. To assess these benefits, we examined the feeding ecology and population size of peri-urban spotted hyenas crocuta crocuta in mekelle, ethiopia. We integrated these field data into a disease transmission model to predict: (a) the number of anthrax and bovine tuberculosis (btb) infections arising in humans and livestock from infected carcass waste and (b) the costs associated with treating these infections and losing livestock. We compared these public health and economic outcomes under two scenarios: (a) hyenas are present and (b) the counterfactual, hyenas are absent. We estimated that hyenas annually remove 4.2% (207 tonnes) of the total carcass waste disposed of by residents and businesses in mekelle. Furthermore, the scavenging behaviour of hyenas annually prevents five infections of anthrax and btb in humans, and 140 infections in cattle, sheep and goats. This disease control service potentially saves usd 52,165 due to the treatment costs and livestock loss avoided. Synthesis and applications. This humanâhyena interaction in ethiopia is evidence that large carnivores can contribute to human health and economy. To retain these benefits and maintain tolerance of hyenas, we recommend introducing education programmes to promote safe outdoor behaviour around hyenas, training watchdogs to alert residents of hyena presence, constructing bomas to protect livestock from hyena attacks, and preserving the hyenas' access to carcass waste to reduce their dependency on livestock predation. With humans and carnivores coming more frequently into contact, understanding and communicating how these species can benefit humanity will be critical to motivating humanâcarnivore coexistence worldwide.

248,2021,"Rangelands and crop fallows can supplement but not replace protected grasslands in sustaining thar desert's avifauna during the dry season","Journal Of Arid Environments","1. The indian thar desert has lost much of its grasslands over the last few decades, mainly due to land-use change from pastoralism to agriculture. Expanding croplands and intensifying grazing pressures are popularly hypothesized to be the major drivers of biodiversity loss in the region. Our study aims to investigate the effects of contemporary land-use change on bird communities of the western thar desert. 2. We surveyed 59 randomly laid line transects in a ~2000 sq.km study area, to quantify parameters of bird community structure in three predominant land-cover types viz. Protected grasslands, rangelands, and fallow croplands. Fieldwork for the study was conducted in the dry season (winter and summer) between december 2018 and april 2019. 3. During winter, overall bird species richness and abundance was highest in protected grasslands followed by fallow croplands and rangelands. Protected grasslands also had a higher abundance of diet and habitat specialists. Compared to protected grasslands, density was lower in fallow croplands and rangelands for 35% and 10% of species, respectively. A majority of the negatively affected species were insectivorous grassland specialists. 4. Contrary to the pattern in winter, overall bird species richness, abundance, composition, and guild structure in summer was similar across the three land-use types. Only one of the 17 analysed species had significantly lower density in modified land-use types. 5. Overall, protected grasslands were the best habitat for birds and specifically important for diet and habitat specialists, more so during the winter. Rangelands and fallow croplands sustained most generalists at comparable densities but had severe negative impacts on specialist species. 6. Synthesis and application: our results point out that low-intensity agro-pastoral land-uses can supplement, but not replace, protected areas in conservation of thar desert's avifaunal diversity. This is in consonance with the idea of managing dryland habitats as agro-grassland mosaics with embedded protected areas, in order to reconcile human needs and biodiversity conservation at a landscape scale.

249,2021,"Could nintendoâs animal crossing be a tool for conservation messaging?","People And Nature","The current extinction crisis demands worldwide commitment to conservation across all sectors of society. By transcending the traditional disciplinary boundaries, conservationists can reach new audiences to communicate pro-conservation knowledge, education and awareness messages. There are approximately 2.7 billion video-gamers worldwide, with millions more joining as a result of global lockdowns. In march 2020, animal crossing: new horizons was released by nintendo, fast becoming the second-best selling video game ever in japan, and selling over 26.4 million units worldwide. Unlike many popular video games, its unique premise involves players creating an island, growing vegetation, catching wildlife and donating fossils and species to a museum. The game has been praised for its positivity, escapism and measurable benefits to mental well-being. Here, we articulate how different features of the game, including the islands, their biodiversity and inhabitants, encourage players to exhibit pro-conservation behaviours and attitudes (e.g. Recycling litter, or planting a diversity of flowers), as well as improving playersâ knowledge about the diversity of relatively little known taxa (marine and freshwater fishes and invertebrates). We also highlight where pitfalls exist (e.g. Encouraging the collection of threatened species). We principally frame these discussions in the context of japan's cultural relationship with the natural world, including its history of insect-collecting and its management of green spaces. We conclude by outlining some recommendations about potential improvements to future releases, or for similar games, that could further promote conservation messaging. This perspective sheds light on the avenues through which animal crossing: new horizons encourages pro-conservation knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of its international audience, with potential for these experiences to translate into real-world conservation actions. During a critical time in humanity's history, video gaming could therefore provide a huge opportunity for communicating conservation messages to billions of people worldwide.

250,2021,"Exposure to batrachochytrium dendrobatidis affects chemical defences in two anuran amphibians, rana dalmatina and bufo bufo","Bmc Ecology And Evolution","Background: batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd) is the causative agent of chytridiomycosis, one of the major causes of worldwide amphibian biodiversity loss. Many amphibians exhibit skin-based chemical defences, which may play an important role against invading pathogens, but whether the synthesis of these chemical compounds is enhanced or suppressed in the presence of pathogens is largely unknown. Here we investigated direct and indirect effects of larval exposure to the globally distributed and highly virulent bd-gpl strain on skin secreted chemical defences and life history traits during early ontogeny of agile frogs (rana dalmatina) and common toads (bufo bufo). Results: exposure to bd during the larval stage did not result in enhanced synthesis of the antimicrobial peptide brevinin-1â da in r. Dalmatina tadpoles or in increased production of bufadienolides in b. Bufo tadpoles. However, exposure to bd during the larval stage had a carry-over effect reaching beyond metamorphosis: both r. Dalmatina and b. Bufo froglets contained smaller quantities of defensive chemicals than their bd-naãve conspecifics in the control treatment. Prevalence of bd and infection intensities were very low in both larvae and metamorphs of r. Dalmatina, while in b. Bufo we observed high bd prevalence and infection intensities, especially in metamorphs. At the same time, we did not find a significant effect of bd-exposure on body mass or development rate in larvae or metamorphs in either species. Conclusions: the lack of detrimental effect of bd-exposure on life history traits, even parallel with high infection intensities in the case of b. Bufo individuals, is surprising and suggests high tolerance of local populations of these two species against bd. However, the lowered quantity of defensive chemicals may compromise antimicrobial and antipredatory defences of froglets, which may ultimately contribute to population declines also in the absence of conspicuous mass-mortality events.

Only 3% of the articles in the final database were on critically endangered fishes; 82% of critically endangered fishes had zero articles. The difference between the number of articles on game fishes and critically endangered fishes increased temporally with more articles on game fishes during the extinction crisis. Countries with 10 or more critically endangered fishes averaged only 17 articles from 1964 to 2018. Countries with the most critically endangered fishes are most in need of science. More scientific knowledge is needed on critically endangered fishes to meet the challenges of conserving fishes during the sixth mass extinction.

252,2021,"Grasslands provide diverse opportunities for bird species along an urban-rural gradient","Urban Ecosystems","Urbanisation is a major cause of biodiversity loss but careful habitat management and provision of green space within cities can help to mitigate its negative effects. Grasslands occupy large surface areas and have many functions but only a few studies have begun to explore how birds exploit these habitats in urban contexts. We hypothesized that the value of grasslands for nesting and feeding birds is likely to depend both on landscape context, and on local characteristics (grassland size, use and vegetation structure). We surveyed local habitat characteristics, breeding bird presence, abundance and foraging activity in 47 grassland sites, distributed along an urban-rural gradient in two french cities, and varying in the proportions of grassland, built-up land and residential gardens in the neighbouring landscape. Species richness was influenced by local rather than landscape variables; larger sites with scrub within the grassland and taller hedgerow vegetation were more species rich. Total bird abundance, however, depended on landscape context, and increased in suburban grasslands with a higher proportion of gardens in the landscape. Foraging in grass was more frequently observed in shorter, regularly mown, recreational grasslands. These were more common in urban contexts and favoured by species requiring easily accessible and visible invertebrate prey. Less intensively managed wastelands were species rich despite being in urban contexts and favoured by seedeaters and one farmland specialist. A diversity of use and management of grasslands along the urban-rural gradient could allow birds with various requirements to co-exist at landscape scale.

Within cambodia, the use of wire snares to capture wildlife is a severe threat in protected areas but there have been few studies of the behaviour of hunters from local communities. Here, we combine the unmatched count technique with direct questioning to estimate the prevalence of hunting behaviours and wildlife consumption amongst 705 households living within keo seima wildlife sanctuary, cambodia. We assessed respondents' knowledge of rules, and their perceptions of patrols responsible for enforcing rules. Estimates of hunting behaviour were variable: results from the unmatched count technique were inconclusive, and direct questioning revealed 9% of households hunted, and 20% set snares around farms to prevent wildlife eating crops. Hunting with domestic dogs was the method most commonly used to catch wildlife (87% of households owned dogs). Wild meat was consumed by 84% of households, and was most frequently bought or caught, but also gifted. We detected a high awareness of conservation rules, but low awareness of punishments and penalties, with wildlife depletion, rather than the risk of being caught by patrols, causing the greatest reduction in hunting. Our findings demonstrate the challenges associated with reliably estimating rule-breaking behaviour and highlight the need to incorporate careful triangulation into study design.

The following results were obtained: (1) the biodiversity loss in the study area is at an âextremeâ level; (2) the rates of average variation and speed have accelerated movement, therefore, the greater the increase of deforested area, the faster the speed and acceleration of biodiversity loss; (3) the curvature of the function indicated that the critical point of biodiversity loss is reached when deforestation reaches 93% of the ecosystem area. It was concluded that the model used to estimate the loss of birds, mammals, and scaly reptiles was efficient to assess biodiversity loss in the atlantic forest ecosystem.

255,2021,"Bottom-up cascading effects of quarry revegetation deplete bird-mediated seed dispersal services","Journal Of Environmental Management","Quarrying activities cause profound modifications on ecosystems, such as removal of vegetation cover, biodiversity loss and depletion of ecosystem services. Ecological restoration stands as a solution to revert such effects. Concomitantly, awareness is currently being given on ecosystem services and ecological processes to evaluate restoration efficiency. The objective of the study was to assess restoration success in a quarry subjected to restoration practices for the last 40 years involving the plantation of native mediterranean vegetation and the non-native aleppo pine pinus halepensis. The study was carried out by assessing the effectiveness of seed dispersal service provided by birds in the restored quarry by comparing this service to neighbouring natural (shrubland) and other semi-natural areas (oak-pine mixed open and aleppo pine forest) present at the landscape. For this purpose, we explored bird composition structure and seed dispersal networks using point counts and faecal samples of mist-netted birds. We also collected vegetation structure data and explored its effect on bird community composition. Our results showed that bird abundance in the restored quarry was significantly lower, and its bird community was compositionally different than natural shrubland and semi-natural areas. For instance, seed-dispersing birds, woody and shrub/ground foragers and partially migrators were the most affected groups at the restored area. Bird community composition and their traits were likely driven by vegetation characteristics, with higher native vegetation cover and fruit richness promoting higher bird abundance and aleppo pine cover negatively influencing seed-dispersing birds. Concurrently, seed dispersal network in the restored quarry was less complex than in other areas. Seed dispersal services in the restored quarry were below the reported values for neighbouring natural and semi-natural areas and are likely driven by the low abundance of seed-dispersing birds. We consider that the causes affecting this group's low abundance can be related to revegetation measures favouring aleppo pine, combined with a shallow soil depth and poor soil quality, which may have constrained native vegetation development. We conclude that seed dispersal services at the quarry are depleted, which may suggest a low restoration success concerning ecosystem functioning. Our results strengthen that quarry revegetation with non-native species must be avoided, since it alters bird community composition, and consequently, affects seed dispersal service provided by birds.

256,2021,"Habitat connectivity and resource selection in an expanding bobcat (lynx rufus) population","Peerj","Terrestrial carnivores are among the most imperiled species worldwide, yet some species are resilient and are recovering in human-dominated landscapes after decades or centuries of absence. Bobcat (lynx rufus) populations were extirpated from much of midwestern us in the mid-1800âs, and are currently expanding and recolonizing their former range. In this study, we investigated multi-scale habitat selection for ohioâs expanding bobcat population, and examined habitat connectivity in order to evaluate the conduits for dispersal statewide. We used citizen observations collected between 1978 and 2019 and logistic regression to evaluate population-level habitat selection, and gps telemetry data for 20 individuals collected between 2012 and 2014 and a distribution-weighted exponential resource selection function to evaluate individual-level habitat selection within home ranges. At the population level, bobcats selected for higher amounts of forest and pasture (at a 50 km2 scale) and herbaceous vegetation (at 15â50 50 km2 scales), thus overall heterogeneous forested habitat. At individual (home range) level, bobcats selected for forested habitats with low road density and farther away from high traffic roads; they also showed weak selection for open habitat at the home range level. Male home ranges were significantly greater than female home ranges. Lastly, we used the population-level spatial outputs (i.e. Habitat suitability map) to parameterize habitat connectivity models using circuit theory in the program circuitscape. We tested three relationships between habitat suitability and resistance to movement and used a subset of data on potential dispersing individuals to evaluate which relationship performed best. All three relationships performed almost equally well, and we calculated a weighted averaged connectivity map as our final map. Habitat was highly permeable to movements between core areas of two genetically distinct subpopulations located in southeastern ohio. We also identified potential dispersal corridors from the core areas to other regions of ohio dominated by agriculture and suburban development via forested riparian corridors. Overall, our analysis offers new information on habitat selection and connectivity in a rebounding felid population and offers important ecological information for wildlife management strategies. We recommend that the suitability and connectivity models should be periodically updated until the population reaches an equilibrium, and be integrated with data from neighboring states for a comprehensive assessment of a conservation success story.

257,2021,"Overfishing drives over one-third of all sharks and rays toward a global extinction crisis","Current Biology","The scale and drivers of marine biodiversity loss are being revealed by the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) red list assessment process. We present the first global reassessment of 1,199 species in class chondrichthyesâsharks, rays, and chimeras. The first global assessment (in 2014) concluded that one-quarter (24%) of species were threatened. Now, 391 (32.6%) species are threatened with extinction. When this percentage of threat is applied to data deficient species, more than one-third (37.5%) of chondrichthyans are estimated to be threatened, with much of this change resulting from new information. Three species are critically endangered (possibly extinct), representing possibly the first global marine fish extinctions due to overfishing. Consequently, the chondrichthyan extinction rate is potentially 25 extinctions per million species years, comparable to that of terrestrial vertebrates. Overfishing is the universal threat affecting all 391 threatened species and is the sole threat for 67.3% of species and interacts with three other threats for the remaining third: loss and degradation of habitat (31.2% of threatened species), climate change (10.2%), and pollution (6.9%). Species are disproportionately threatened in tropical and subtropical coastal waters. Science-based limits on fishing, effective marine protected areas, and approaches that reduce or eliminate fishing mortality are urgently needed to minimize mortality of threatened species and ensure sustainable catch and trade of others. Immediate action is essential to prevent further extinctions and protect the potential for food security and ecosystem functions provided by this iconic lineage of predators.

258,2021,"Evolution of beak and feather disease virus across three decades of conservation intervention for population recovery of the mauritius parakeet","Diversity","Emerging infectious diseases (eids) are key contributors to the current global biodiversity crisis. Psittaciformes (parrots) are one of the most vulnerable avian taxa and psittacine beak and feather disease (pbfd) is the most common viral disease in wild parrots. Pbfd is caused by the beak and feather disease virus (bfdv), which belongs to the circoviridae family and comprises a circular, single-stranded dna genome. Bfdv is considered to have spread rapidly across the world and, in 2005, an outbreak of pbfd was documented in the recovering population of the mauritius parakeet (alexandrinus eques). The mauritius parakeet was once the worldâs rarest parrot and has been suc-cessfully recovered through 30 years of intensive conservation management. Molecular surveillance for the prevalence of bfdv was carried out across a 24-year sample archive spanning the period from 1993 to 2017, and dna sequencing of positive individuals provided an opportunity to assess patterns of phylogenetic and haplotype diversity. Phylogenetic analyses show variation in the extent of viral diversification within the replicase protein (rep). Timeseries of bfdv prevalence and number of haplotypes reveal that two subsequent waves of infection occurred in 2010/2011 and 2013/2014 following the initial outbreak in 2005. Continued disease surveillance to determine the frequency and intensity of subsequent waves of infection may benefit future translocation/reintroduction planning. The continued growth of the mauritius parakeet population despite the presence of bfdv bodes well for its long-term persistence. Â© 2021 by the authors.

259,2021,"Large wild herbivores slow down the rapid decline of plant diversity in a tropical forest biodiversity hotspot","Journal Of Applied Ecology","The un declaration of the decade of ecosystem restoration 2021â2030 emphasizes the need for effective measures to restore ecosystems and safeguard biodiversity. Large herbivores regulate many ecosystem processes and functions; yet, their potential as a nature-based solution to buffer against long-term temporal declines in biodiversity associated with global change and restore diversity in secondary forests remains unknown. By means of an exclusion experiment, we tested experimentally the buffering effects of large wild herbivores to avert against long-term biodiversity collapse in old-growth and secondary tropical forests in the atlantic forest of brazil where sapling abundance and species richness declined c. 20% over the course of 10â years. The experiment comprised 50 large herbivore exclosure-open control plot pairs (25 at the old-growth forest and 25 at the secondary forest), where 2â m2 were monitored in every plot during a 10-year period. Large herbivores were able to decelerate diversity declines and compositional change in the species-rich old-growth forest, but only decelerated compositional change in the secondary forest. In contrast, declines in species richness and abundance were unaffected by large herbivores on either forest. The buffering effects of large herbivores were strongly nonlinear and contingent on the initial level of diversity at the patch scale: highly diverse communities suffered the strongest collapse in the absence of large herbivores. Thus, larger buffering effects of large herbivores on the old-growth forest are the logical consequence of large herbivores buffering the many high diversity plant communities found in this forest. Conversely, as the secondary forest held fewer high diversity patches, buffering effects on the secondary forest were weak. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that large herbivores have moderate yet critical effects on slowing down community change and diversity loss of highly diverse plant communities, thus suggesting that the conservation of (and potentially trophic rewilding with) large herbivores is a fundamental nature-based solution for averting the global collapse of the strongholds of biodiversity. Its buffering effects on biodiversity loss operate at very small spatial scales, are likely contingent on successional stage and are most effective in old-growth or high diversity secondary forests.

260,2021,"Identifying mismatches between conservation area networks and vulnerable populations using spatial randomization","Ecology And Evolution","Grassland birds are among the most globally threatened bird groups due to substantial degradation of native grassland habitats. However, the current network of grassland conservation areas may not be adequate for halting population declines and biodiversity loss. Here, we evaluate a network of grassland conservation areas within wisconsin, u.s.a., that includes both large focal landscapes and smaller targeted conservation areas (e.g., grassland bird conservation areas, gbcas) established within them. To date, this conservation network has lacked baseline information to assess whether the current placement of these conservation areas aligns with population hot spots of grassland-dependent taxa. To do so, we fitted data from thousands of avian point-count surveys collected by citizen scientists as part of wisconsin's breeding bird atlas ii with multinomial n-mixture models to estimate habitatâabundance relationships, develop spatially explicit predictions of abundance, and establish ecological baselines within priority conservation areas for a suite of obligate grassland songbirds. Next, we developed spatial randomization tests to evaluate the placement of this conservation network relative to randomly placed conservation networks. Overall, less than 20% of species statewide populations were found within the current grassland conservation network. Spatial tests demonstrated a high representation of this bird assemblage within the entire conservation network, but with a bias toward birds associated with moderately tallgrasses relative to those associated with shortgrasses or tallgrasses. We also found that gbcas had higher representation at focal landscape rather than statewide scales. Here, we demonstrated how combining citizen science data with hierarchical modeling is a powerful tool for estimating ecological baselines and conducting large-scale evaluations of an existing conservation network for multiple grassland birds. Our flexible spatial randomization approach offers the potential to be applied to other protected area networks and serves as a complementary tool for conservation planning efforts globally.

261,2021,"The effects of the spatial extent on modelling giant panda distributions using ecological niche models","Sustainability (Switzerland)","Climate change and biodiversity loss have become increasingly prominent in recent years. To evaluate these two issues, prediction models have been developed on the basis of ecological-niche (or climateâenvelope) models. However, the spatial scale and extent of the underlying environmental data are known to affect results. To verify whether the difference in the modelled spatial extent will affect model results, this study uses the maxent model to predict the suitability range of giant pandas in the min mountain system (mms) area through modelling performed (1) at a nationwide scale and (2) at a restricted mms extent. The results show that, firstly, both models performed well in terms of accuracy. Secondly, extending the modelling extent does help improve the modelling results when the distribution data is incomplete. Thirdly, when environmental information is insufficient, the qualitative analysis should be combined with quantitative analysis to ensure the accuracy and practicality of the research. Finally, when predicting a suitability distribution of giant pandas, the modelling results under different spatial extents can provide management agencies at the various administrative levels with more targeted giant panda protective measures.

262,2021,"Setting priority conservation management regions to reverse rapid range decline of a key neotropical forest ungulate","Global Ecology And Conservation","Mammals are important components of biodiversity that have been drastically and rapidly impacted by climate change, habitat loss, and anthropogenic pressure. Understanding key species distribution to optimize conservation targets is both urgent and necessary to reverse the current biodiversity crisis. Herein, we applied habitat suitability models for a key neotropical forest ungulate, the white-lipped peccary (wlp tayassu pecari), to investigate the effects of climate and landscape modifications on its distribution, which has been drastically reduced in brazil. We used 318 primary records of wlp to derive habitat suitability maps across brazil. Our models included bioclimatic, topographic, landscape, and human influence predictors in two modelling approaches. Models including all categories of predictors obtained the highest predictive ability and showed prevalence of suitable areas in forested regions of the country, covering 49% of the brazilian territory. Filtering out small forest fragments (<2050 ha) reduced the suitable area by 5%, with a further reduction of 4% that was caused by deforestation until 2020, therefore until 2020, the species has suffered a reduction of ~60% from its historical range in brazil. Of the 40% of the brazilian territory suitable to wlp, only 12% is protected. In the atlantic forest, only half of all protected areas have suitable habitat for wlp and even less in pantanal (44%), cerrado (14%) and caatinga (7%). In a second modelling approach, mapping the areas with suitable climate and those with suitable landscapes separately, allowed us to identify four categories of conservation values, and showed that only 17% of the brazilian territory has both high landscape and climatic suitability for wlp. Our models can help inform complementary conservation management strategies and actions that could be essential in slowing down and possibly reversing current trends of population and geographic range reductions for the species, thereby averting a possible future collapse of forest ecosystem functioning in the neotropical region.

Here we provide a detailed account of the chinese milu (elaphurus davidianus) conservation and reintroduction efforts over the past 35 years, and give updated information on current milu distribution, population dynamics and conservation status based on long-term monitoring (1985â2020) and a detailed follow-up investigation (2013â2020) in 235 wildlife institutions throughout china. Milu conservation in china comprised three phases: i) establishing ex situ populations and increasing the number of milu through captive breeding (1985â1992); ii) preparing captive milu for life in the wild and establishing in situ conservation populations (1993â1997); and iii) reintroduction of milu into the wild throughout their historic range (1998âongoing). Currently, there are ca. 9062 milu (including 2825 wild individuals) distributed across 83 sites with 7380 individuals living at beijing milu park, jiangsu dafeng milu nature reserve and hubei shishou milu nature reserve. The average birth rates in three sites were all over 0.200, and the average adult mortality rates were below 0.085, resulting in a rapid population growth.

264,2021,"South africaâs private wildlife ranches protect globally significant populations of wild ungulates","Biodiversity And Conservation","Reversing biodiversity loss is a global imperative that requires setting aside sufficient space for species. In south africa, an estimated area of 20 million ha is under wildlife ranching, a form of private land enterprise that adopts wildlife-based land uses for commercial gain. This land has potential to contribute towards biodiversity conservation, but the extent to which this occurs has not been evaluated. Using structured questionnaires of 226 wildlife ranchers, we assessed how the sector contributes towards the conservation of ungulates and elephants (hereafter herbivores). Overall, 40 herbivore species were present across the sample, where individual ranches had a mean of 15.0 (â± 4.8) species, 1.9 (â± 1.5) threatened species, and 3.6 (â± 3.1) extralimital species per property. In comparison to 54 state pas, wildlife ranches had significantly higher species richness, more threatened species but more extralimital species when property/reserve size was controlled for. Ranches conducting trophy hunting had similar species richness and numbers of extralimital species per ha, but fewer threatened species when compared to ranches conducting ecotourism. We estimate that 4.66â7.25 million herbivores occur on ranches nationally, representing one of the few examples on earth where indigenous mammal populations are thriving and demonstrating how sustainable use can lead to rewilding. We discuss the potential negative impacts of widespread game fencing on landscape fragmentation and gene flow, as well as how the widespread occurrence of extralimital species may lead to hybridisation, biotic homogenisation, and changes to vegetation dynamics. Despite these challenges, commercial wildlife ranching offers a viable option for conserving large mammalian herbivore biodiversity.

However, the growing interest in non-native reptiles as pets has posed serious concerns to wildlife managers and conservationists. Instituting effective policies regarding non-native reptiles requires a thorough understanding of the potential range of species in new environments. In this study, we used an ensemble of ten species distribution models to predict the potential distribution for 23 of the most commonly traded species of reptiles across the middle east. We used ten modeling techniques implemented in the biomod2 package and ensemble forecasts. Final models used thirty environmental variables, including climatic, topographic, and land cover/land use variables. Our results indicate that all middle eastern countries included suitable habitats for at least six species, except qatar, kuwait and bahrain, for which the models did not predict any suitable habitats. Our study showed that lebanon, palestine, turkey, and israel face the highest risk of biological invasion based on the area of suitable habitats for all studied species.

The final indicator incorporates over 3000 abundance time series and contains data for more than 50% of canadian native vertebrate species. Species abundance declined by an average 10% between 1970 and 2014, with trends varying across taxonomic groups. To facilitate the interpretation of the indicator and contribute to the transparency of the reporting process, here we present a discussion of the indicator's coverage, data quality and data gaps. Using data collected for other purposes means the dataset inherits the biases in biodiversity monitoring. We therefore assessed taxonomic and geographic coverage of the data underlying the indicator to highlight which areas and groups are under-represented. Birds are comprehensively monitored across canada and are considered good indicators of the state of the environment. Other taxonomic groups are less well monitored, and the data available for these groups often consist of shorter and less full time series, representing smaller segments of the national population. A disaggregation based on data quality appears to show that trends based on species with lower quality data are more negative than for species with higher quality data. We discuss possible sources of the difference, including the relationship between taxon and data quality. Additional data collection on species contributing to the lower-quality subsets is needed to confirm negative trends.

268,2021,"Integrative ichthyological species delimitation in the greenthroat darter complex (percidae: etheostomatinae)","Zoologica Scripta","Species delimitation is fundamental to deciphering the mechanisms that generate and maintain biodiversity. Alpha taxonomy historically relied on expert knowledge to describe new species using phenotypic and biogeographic evidence, which has the appearance of investigator subjectivity. In contrast, dna-based methods using the multispecies coalescent model (msc) promise a more objective approach to describing biodiversity. However, recent criticisms suggest that under some conditions the msc may over-split lineages, identifying species that do not reflect biological reality. Here, we reconcile these approaches using empirical data for the greenthroat darter complex (etheostoma lepidum), a small freshwater fish species with a disjunct distribution in texas and new mexico, usa. We demonstrate that msc methods recognizes all nine sampled populations as distinct species, sometimes splitting specimens from a single locality into multiple species. However, environmental, phenotypic, and biogeographic evidence do not corroborate the nine species supported by the msc. Instead, collective evidence indicates that e. Lepidum is comprised of just three species that are consistent with the molecular phylogeny: etheostoma lepidum (greenthroat darter) in rivers draining the eastern edwards plateau, etheostoma cf. Lepidum (texas darter) in the concho and san saba rivers, and etheostoma cf. Lepidum (pecos darter) in the pecos river. The pecos darter is likely highly imperiled due to its localized distribution and reliance on vanishing spring-fed stream habitats. The impending biodiversity crisis makes integrative and swift species delimitation more necessary than ever. Our study exemplifies how classic taxonomic expertise combined with molecular phylogenetics can produce a more robust description of threatened biodiversity.

We analysed ~2 million detections for 23 species, ranging from reef fish such as nassau grouper (epinephelus striatus, serranidae) to migratory apex predators such as white sharks (carcharodon carcharias, lamnidae). To facilitate comparisons across species, we used an eco-evolutionary movement strategy framework that identified measurable movement traits and their proximate and ultimate drivers. Detectability was species-specific and quantified with a detection potential index. Life stages detected in the study area varied by species and residency varied with life stage. Four annual movement types were identified as follows: high site-fidelity residents, range residents, seasonal migrants and general migrants. The endangered smalltooth sawfish (pristis pectinata, pristidae), a seasonal migrant, exhibited the greatest within-ecosystem connectivity. Site attachment, stopover and deep-water migration behaviours differed between individuals, species and annual movement types. All apex predators were migratory. General migrants were significantly larger than fish in the other movement types, a life-history and movement trait combination that is common but not exclusive, as many small pelagics also migrate. Most teleosts exhibited movements associated with spawning. As concerns grow over habitat and biodiversity loss, multispecies movescapes, such as presented here, are expected to play an increasingly important role in informing ecosystem-based and non-extractive fisheries management strategies.

270,2021,"Carbofuran affects behavior and metabolism of the atlantic forest lambari deuterodon iguape, a native species from brazil","Environmental Science And Pollution Research","One of the major causes of aquatic biodiversity loss is the contamination of the environment by pesticides. Even though there is a considerable amount of studies on the subject, there are still few that deal with the effects of carbofuran on native species in brazil. Although carbofuran is widely used in brazil, its action on native organisms, such as the atlantic forest lambari deuterodon iguape, has not yet been studied. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of exposure to carbofuran on the fish d. Iguape, considering the behavior and specific oxygen consumption as end points. Opercular movements, dorsal fin movements, and swimming speed were analyzed as behavioral parameters. To assess specific oxygen consumption, fish were subjected to concentrations of 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/l, for 24 h. For behavior analysis, fish remained exposed to carbofuran at concentrations of 0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg/l, in periods of 0, 2, 24, and 48 h. The behavior was studied through filming, analyzed with the free software, tracker 4.92 (open source physics). The results demonstrate an increase in opercular movements (18% â± 2.65) and a decrease in dorsal fin movements (â 21.2% â± 2.97), as well as in swimming speed (â 58.3% â± 1.83) of the experimental groups compared to the control group. There was an increase in oxygen consumption of 58.4% in fish exposed to the highest concentration of carbofuran. Thus, it is concluded that carbofuran altered d.

271,2021,"Direct and latent effects of pathogen exposure across native and invasive amphibian life stages","Frontiers In Veterinary Science","Emerging infectious diseases are one of the multiple factors contributing to the current âbiodiversity crisisâ. As part of the worldwide biodiversity crisis, amphibian populations are declining globally. Chytridiomycosis, an emerging infectious disease, caused by the fungal pathogen batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd), is a major cause of amphibian population declines. This fungus primarily affects keratinized structures in larval, juvenile, and adult amphibians as well as heart function. However, we know little about how bd can impact embryos as well as potential latent effects of bd exposure over ontogeny. Using two different bd strains and multiple exposure times, we examined the effects of bd exposure in pacific chorus frog (pseudacris regilla), western toad (anaxyrus boreas) and american bullfrog (lithobates catesbeianus) life stages. Using a factorial experimental design, embryos of these three species were exposed to bd at early and late embryonic stages, with some individuals re-exposed after hatching. Embryonic bd exposure resulted in differential survival as a function of host species, bd strain and timing of exposure. P. Regilla experienced embryonic mortality when exposed during later developmental stages to one bd strain. There were no differences across the treatments in embryonic mortality of a. Boreas and embryonic mortality of l. Catesbeianus occurred in all bd exposure treatments. We detected latent effects in a. Boreas and l. Catesbeianus larvae, as mortality increased when individuals had been exposed to any of the bd strains during the embryonic stage. We also detected direct effects on larval mortality in all three anuran species as a function of bd strain, and when individuals were double exposed (late in the embryonic stage and again as larvae). Our results suggest that exposure to bd can directly affect embryo survival and has direct and latent effects on larvae survival of both native and invasive species. However, these impacts were highly context dependent, with timing of exposure and bd strain influencing the severity of the effects.

272,2021,"Coral reef fishes reveal strong divergence in the prevalence of traits along the global diversity gradient","Proceedings Of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","Coral reefs are experiencing declines due to climate change and local human impacts. While at a local scale these impacts induce biodiversity loss and shifts in community structure, previous biogeographical analyses recorded consistent taxonomic structure of fish communities across global coral reefs. This suggests that regional communities represent a random subset of the global species and traits pool, whatever their species richness. Using distributional data on 3586 fish species and latest advances in species distribution models, we show marked gradients in the prevalence of size classes and diet categories across the biodiversity gradient. This divergence in trait structure is best explained by reef isolation during past unfavourable climatic conditions, with large and piscivore fishes better represented in isolated areas. These results suggest the risk of a global community re-organization if the ongoing climate-induced reef fragmentation is not halted.

273,2021,"Shooting skinks for good: producing a movie improves attitudes towards a threatened species","Science Of The Total Environment","The interaction between the anthroposphere and the biosphere has resulted in increasingly rapid biodiversity loss. This negative interaction is influenced by attitudes (feelings, actions, and perceptions) of humans towards certain species. Despite the importance of reptiles in food chains and ecosystem services, they are often negatively perceived, resulting in fear and persecution. In this scenario, education for sustainable development (esd) may contribute for students to develop positive attitudes towards nature and, in particular, towards reptile conservation. Some studies showed that watching wildlife movies improves attitudes of people towards wildlife. However, few information is available on the impact of engaging people in movie production in their attitudes on biodiversity. Here we present an exploratory case study and describe a project-based learning activity (pbl) implemented with cabo verdean high-school students and planned to improve their perceptions, feelings and actions towards reptiles in general, and the threatened endemic species c. Vaillanti in particular. We asked students to write a script, shoot and produce a short film that could improve the attitudes of their community towards this endemic species. This movie was then presented to the community in a public event and subjected to a content analysis. To evaluate the impact of the activity on students, they were asked to fill in two questionnaires, before and after the activity. Our results showed significant increase of positive feelings of students about the reptiles, and increased perception of their importance, and of positive actions towards c. Vaillanti from pre to post test. The movie content analyses and interviews showed that students learned about species biology, threats and reasons for its conservation, of which endemicity was the most frequently cited. Our findings support the value of engaging the public in pbl for eds and the positive impacts of this engagement in public attitudes towards species conservation.

274,2021,"Impacts of large and small barriers on fish assemblage composition assessed using environmental dna metabarcoding","Science Of The Total Environment","River fragmentation caused by instream barriers is a leading cause of biodiversity loss, particularly for freshwater migratory fish, the vertebrate group that has suffered the steepest decline. However, most studies have tended to focus on the impacts of large dams on only a few taxa. We estimated the cumulative impact of both large and small barriers on fish species richness and relative abundance along an altitudinal gradient in the main stem of the river allier (france). Using edna metabarcoding, we identified 24 fish zero-radius operational taxonomic units (zotus), corresponding to 26 species distributed along the main stem of the river. Elevation explained the greatest amount of variation in fish distribution, together with average flow, barrier density and its interaction with cumulative barrier height. Based on edna, the largest discontinuity in species richness was not related to the location of poutãs, the largest dam in the system, but located downstream from it. Our results indicate that, in addition to the more obvious effects of large dams on migratory fish such as the atlantic salmon, the cumulative effects of small barriers can have widespread impacts on fish species richness and relative abundance, which should not be overlooked. We suggest that, as for other fragmented rivers, acting on numerous small barriers might bring about greater benefits in fish species richness than focusing only on the largest dams.

275,2021,"What is the evidence that counter-wildlife crime interventions are effective for conserving african, asian and latin american wildlife directly threatened by exploitation? A systematic map protocol","Ecological Solutions And Evidence","Human activities are driving a global biodiversity crisis. In response, a broad range of conservation actions have been implemented. With finite resources available, and a rapidly narrowing window, the scientific and policy communities have acknowledged the need to better understand the effectiveness of interventions for conserving threatened species. Given the recent emphasis on the use of counter wildlife crime interventions (i.e. Those that directly protect wildlife from illegal harvest, detect and sanction rule-breakers, and interdict and control illegal wildlife commodities), there is a clear need to summarize the available evidence on biological and threat reduction outcomes of such actions to help make evidence-informed management and funding decisions. Here, we present a protocol for a systematic map that will collate the existing body of literature addressing the effectiveness of counter-wildlife crime interventions for protecting targeted species. Our focus will be on select species or species groups directly threatened by exploitation (i.e. Illegal harming whether by harvest as a resource or for control/persecution) and native to africa, asia and latin america, which are regions that have experienced significant wildlife populations declines. The systematic map will aim to capture available evidence found in commercially published and grey literature. We will search for the literature using four publication databases, google scholar, 36 specialist websites and databases and sources identified through a call for evidence among relevant networks. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two stages: (1) title and abstract and (2) full text. Relevant information from included papers will be extracted and entered into a searchable, coded database (ms-excel). Narrative synthesis and descriptive statistics will describe the key characteristics of the relevant evidence base (e.g. Geographic location, species, interventions, direct threats, outcomes and study designs). Using visual heat maps, we will identify key knowledge gaps warranting further research and clusters of evidence that could serve as topics for future systematic reviews. The resulting map will guide further exploration on evaluating the effectiveness of counter-wildlife crime interventions, and aid in building an evidence base that supports both management and funding decisions to ensure efficient use of limited resources and maximal conservation benefits.

276,2021,"Impact of predator exclusion and habitat on seroprevalence of new world orthohantavirus harbored by two sympatric rodents within the interior atlantic forest","Viruses","Understanding how perturbations to trophic interactions influence virusâhost dynamics is essential in the face of ongoing biodiversity loss and the continued emergence of rna viruses and their associated zoonoses. Herein, we investigated the role of predator exclusion on rodent communities and the seroprevalence of hantaviruses within the reserva natural del bosque mbaracayã (rnbm), which is a protected area of the interior atlantic forest (iaf). In the iaf, two sympatric rodent reservoirs, akodon montensis and oligoryzomys nigripes, harbor jaborã and juquitiba hantavirus (jabv, juqv), respectively. In this study, we employed two complementary methods for predator exclusion: comprehensive fencing and trapping/removal. The goal of exclusion was to preclude the influence of predation on small mammals on the sampling grids and thereby potentially reduce rodent mortality. Following baseline sampling on three grid pairs with different habitats, we closed the grids and began predator removal. By sampling three habitat types, we controlled for habitat-specific effects, which is important for hantavirusâreservoir dynamics in neotropical ecosystems. Our six-month predator exclusion experiment revealed that the exclusion of terrestrial mammalian predators had little influence on the rodent community or the population dynamics of a. Montensis and o. Nigripes. Instead, fluctuations in species diversity and species abundances were influenced by sampling session and forest degradation. These results suggest that seasonality and landscape composition play dominant roles in the prevalence of hantaviruses in rodent reservoirs in the iaf ecosystem. Â© 2021 by the authors.

277,2021,"Understanding the dynamics of humanâwildlife conflicts in north-western pakistan: implications for sustainable conservation","Sustainability (Switzerland)","The high economic costs of humanâwildlife conflicts (hwc) hinder long-term conservation successes, especially in developing countries. We investigated hwc by interviewing 498 respondents from 42 villages in nowshera district, pakistan. According to respondents, six speciesâthe common leopard (panthera pardus), grey wolf (canis lupus), golden jackal (canis aureus), red fox (vulpes vulpes), indian porcupine (hystrix indica), and wild boar (sus scrofa)âwere involved in livestock predation and crop-raiding. Livestock predation (n = 670) translated into a total annual economic loss of usd 48,490 across the 42 villages, with the highest economic loss of usd 57.1/household/year attributed to the golden jackal. Crop damage by wild boar and porcupine incurred a total annual economic loss of usd 18,000. Results further showed that livestock predation was highly affected by location, prey type, prey age, and herding practices, while cereals and vegetables were preferred crops for wild boar and indian porcupine. The grey wolf was declared as the most dangerous carnivore, followed by the golden jackal and common leopard. Negative attitude about golden jackal and wild boar prevails among 90% of the respondents of the study area. We strongly assume that the abundance of apex predators can control the economic impacts of meso-carnivores and wild boar on the communityâs livelihood. Keeping relatively smaller herds may reduce carnivore attacks and educating the populous and compensation can minimise negative perceptions of hwc. To reduce hwc in the study area, there should be an incessant and timely coordination between wildlife officials and the local community. Â© 2021 by the authors.

278,2021,"Making the connection: combining habitat suitability and landscape connectivity to understand species distribution in an agricultural landscape","Landscape Ecology","Context: the current biodiversity crisis has intensified the need to predict species responses to landscape modification and has renewed attention on the fundamental question of what influences the dynamics of species distributions. Landscape composition can affect two main components that dictate distributions: habitat suitability and habitat connectivity. Elucidating the relative importance of these factors and associated landscape features can help prioritize management action for species conservation. Objectives: our objective was to use species distribution models and network-based landscape connectivity models to understand which landscape factors were most predictive of the distribution of an anuran, blanchardâs cricket frog (acris blanchardi), in an agriculturally-dominated landscape. Methods: we conducted our study in ohio, usa, near the edge of the cricket frogâs contracting range. To obtain a current assessment of cricket frog distribution, we surveyed 367 pond and stream locations across three northâsouth transects. We then tested seven regression models, combining habitat suitability and landscape connectivity metrics, to determine which factors best predicted cricket frog presence. Results: we detected cricket frogs in 24% of surveyed locations and they were more likely to occupy pond sites than stream sites. Cricket frog presence was best predicted by models with habitat suitability and the number of interconnected habitat patches. We found that, while there was high variation in habitat suitability across the study area, landscape connectivity was relatively uniform where we surveyed. Conclusions: agricultural landscapes around the world are often mosaics of land cover types, which may functionally provide connectivity for some species. In such areas, conservation management should focus on preserving and restoring regions of highly suitable habitat. This focus may be particularly relevant for species that do not appear to be dispersal limited and, therefore, able to maintain metapopulation dynamics.

279,2021,"Assessing the importance of field margins for bat species and communities in intensive agricultural landscapes","Agriculture, Ecosystems And Environment","Landscape simplification and degradation through agricultural intensification is widely recognized as a main driver of biodiversity loss. In intensively used agricultural landscapes, patches of semi-natural habitats and particularly connections between them are of high importance for many taxa. Vegetated connections like hedgerows are especially important for foraging and commuting of mobile taxa such as bats. However, the interest of another treeless linear habitat â herbaceous field margins â remains unstudied for insectivorous bats. Field margins are nevertheless known as an important habitat for other taxa, including bat prey. Here we assessed the importance of field margins for bats compared to other landscape variables. We measured bat activity based on a repeated passive acoustic monitoring during 17 complete nights in summer on 112 study sites in an intensively used agricultural landscape. Each night, we sampled bat species activity and community metrics (i.e. Species richness and community habitat specialization index) at different distances to field margins, and along a gradient of relative density of field margins. To compare field margin effects with other landscape variables, the sampled sites were selected by keeping a large variability in these other variables (land-cover shannon diversity index, forests, hedgerows, water bodies, main roads, urban areas, grasslands, number of crops and rapeseed percentage). Only myotis sp. Were affected by herbaceous field margins. Specifically, the myotis group activity decreased with the distance to herbaceous field margins (i.e. Towards field crop cores), and positively correlated with relative density of herbaceous field margins, for which the effect size was comparable to other landscape variables. However, other landscape variables such as the proportion of and the distance to forests, the relative density of and the distance to hedgerows or land-cover shannon diversity index, affected species richness, community specialization index, and bat activity of species from open, edge and narrow-space foragers, including the myotis group as well. Our results highlight that herbaceous field margins have a positive effect on the activity of narrow-space bat foragers as myotis species, but do not replace other landscape variables that drive the activity of the whole community.

Has the emergence of âenvironmental statesâ with significant environmental laws and policy changed the state's vision towards nonhumans, particularly endangered wildlife? These are key questions in a paradoxical context where over the past half century, endangered wildlife have largely continued to decline amid expanding state environmental legislation. Towards answers, we analyze how endangered marine animals in canada are considered in federal environmental assessments (eas) that inform state decisions about whether to authorize major development projects. We conducted an inductive content analysis of all federal eas for projects with potential adverse effects for one or more of the 14 endangered marine vertebrates in canada. Of 32 projects, 31 were approved, 30 of which were predicted to have no or insignificant impacts on endangered marine species, despite a litany of potential impacts. This analysis reveals four main justifications for predicting insignificant impacts: unproven mitigation measures; species are presumed to have a low likelihood of occurrence in project areas; species behaviour is believed to reduce the likelihood of impacts; and project impacts are characterized as minor compared to existing activity. A consistent vision of nature underpins these justifications: the state sees marine species and ocean ecologies in a simplified manner, while these species also remain strategically illegible. Simplification and strategic illegibility both devalue endangered marine animals, suggesting ea is failing endangered marine species by facilitating the state's ability to prioritize development over species recovery.

281,2021,"Complex interactions between commercial and noncommercial drivers of illegal trade for a threatened felid","Animal Conservation","Illegal trade and human-wildlife conflict are two key drivers of biodiversity loss and are recognized as leading threats to large carnivores. Although human-wildlife conflict involving jaguars (panthera onca) has received significant attention in the past, less is known about traditional use or commercial trade in jaguar body parts, including their potential links with retaliatory killing. Understanding the drivers of jaguar killing, trade and consumption is necessary to develop appropriate jaguar conservation strategies, particularly as demand for jaguar products appears to be rising due to chinese demand. We interviewed 1107 rural households in north-western bolivia, an area with an active history of humanâjaguar conflict, which has also been at the epicentre of recent jaguar trade cases. We collected information on participants' experiences with jaguars, their jaguar killing, trading and consuming behaviours and potential drivers of these behaviours. We found that the relationships between local people and jaguars are complex and are driven largely by traditional practices, opportunism, humanâjaguar conflict and market incentives from foreign and domestic demand, in the absence of law awareness and enforcement. Addressing jaguar trade and building humanâjaguar coexistence will require a multifaceted approach that considers the multiple drivers of jaguar killing, trade and consumption, from foreign and local demand to humanâjaguar conflict.

282,2021,"Identifying the possibilities and pitfalls of conducting iucn red list assessments from remotely sensed habitat information based on insights from poorly known cuban mammals","Conservation Biology","The international union for conservation of nature's red list of threatened species (rls) is the key global tool for objective, repeatable assessment of speciesâ extinction risk status, and plays an essential role in tracking biodiversity loss and guiding conservation action. Satellite remote sensing (srs) data sets on global ecosystem distributions and functioning show exciting potential for informing range-based rls assessment, but their incorporation has been restricted by low temporal resolution and coverage of data sets, lack of incorporation of degradation-driven habitat loss, and noninclusion of assumptions related to identification of changing habitat distributions for taxa with varying habitat dependency and ecologies. For poorly known mangrove-associated cuban hutias (mesocapromys spp.), we tested the impact of possible assumptions regarding these issues on range-based rls assessment outcomes. Specifically, we used annual (1985â2018) landsat data and land-cover classification and habitat degradation analyses across different internal time series slices to simulate range-based rls assessments for our case study taxa to explore potential assessment uncertainty arising from temporal srs data set coverage, incorporating proxies of (change in) habitat quality, and assumptions on spatial scaling of habitat extent for rls parameter generation. We found extensive variation in simulated species-specific range-based rls assessments, and this variation was mostly associated with the time series over which parameters were estimated. However, results of some species-specific assessments differed by up to 3 categories (near threatened to critically endangered) within the same time series, due to the effects of incorporating habitat quality and the spatial scaling used in rls parameter estimation. Our results showed that a one-size-fits-all approach to incorporating srs information in rls assessment is inappropriate, and we urge caution in conducting range-based assessments with srs for species for which habitat dependence on specific ecosystem types is incompletely understood. We propose novel revisions to parameter spatial scaling guidelines to improve integration of existing time series data on ecosystem change into the rls assessment process. Â© 2021 the authors.

We aimed to investigate the relative roles of the construction of upstream cascade dams and the longitudinal gradient in environmental conditions in the spatial and temporal variations in fish assemblages in a downstream reservoir. Fish assemblage and abiotic data from four longitudinally distributed reaches in the three gorges reservoir (tgr), chinaâone of the largest reservoirs worldwideâwere collected over 8â years (2011â2018) and analysed. The results showed that the blockage to fish passage, as well as the flow modification, caused by the upstream dams and reservoirs can significantly affect the variations in fish assemblages downstream of the tgr; fish assemblages in the upper area of the tgr were more vulnerable to upstream dam construction than those in the lower area. The longitudinal environmental gradient was more important in determining the spatial and temporal distributions of fish assemblages in the reservoir than the combined effects caused by the upstream dams and reservoirs. The spatial distribution pattern of fish assemblage structure in the tgr was mainly determined by the gradient difference in the flow regime among stations, whereas the construction of two upstream dams mainly affected the temporal variations in fish assemblages of the tgr by altering the downstream flow and thermal regimes and blocking fish movement down to the tgr.

285,2021,"Congruent trophic pathways underpin global coral reef food webs","Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America","Ecological interactions uphold ecosystem structure and functioning. However, as species richness increases, the number of possible interactions rises exponentially. More than 6,000 species of coral reef fishes exist across the world's tropical oceans, resulting in an almost innumerable array of possible trophic interactions. Distilling general patterns in these interactions across different bioregions stands to improve our understanding of the processes that govern coral reef functioning. Here, we show that across bioregions, tropical coral reef food webs exhibit a remarkable congruence in their trophic interactions. Specifically, by compiling and investigating the structure of six coral reef food webs across distinct bioregions, we show that when accounting for consumer size and resource availability, these food webs share more trophic interactions than expected by chance. In addition, coral reef food webs are dominated by dietary specialists, which makes trophic pathways vulnerable to biodiversity loss. Prey partitioning among these specialists is geographically consistent, and this pattern intensifies when weak interactions are disregarded. Our results suggest that energy flows through coral reef communities along broadly comparable trophic pathways. Yet, these critical pathways are maintained by species with narrow, specialized diets, which threatens the existence of coral reef functioning in the face of biodiversity loss.

286,2021,"Using phylogenetics to explore interspecies genetic rescue options for a critically endangered parrot","Conservation Science And Practice","As the global biodiversity crisis deepens, with increasing habitat fragmentation and a changing climate, innovative options for conserving species are being explored. One such conservation action is genetic rescue: introduction of new alleles to promote population fitness. However, for critically endangered species where only one viable population remains, options for introducing new alleles are limited. Interspecies hybridization offers a potential solution but requires resolution of evolutionary relationships, a sound understanding of species biology, social license, and permissive legislative frameworks. Here, we show how phylogenetics and species biology can inform genetic rescue options for the orange-bellied parrot (obp; neophema chrysogaster), a critically endangered australian bird with one small remaining wild population. Our phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial genomes and nuclear loci for all congeneric species provided strong support for obps being the sister species to a group comprising elegant, rock, and blue-winged parrots. Accounting for species distribution, behavior, and ecology, a captive trial of interspecific hybridization with the blue-winged parrot is recommended, including assessment of the fitness of hybrid individuals. Introduction of new alleles into the obp genome would achieve the conservation goal of improving genetic diversity in a critically endangered species.

We investigated the global population genomics of tiger sharks (galeocerdo cuvier), a circumglobally distributed, apex predator displaying remarkable behavioral versatility in its diet, habitat use (near coastal, coral reef, pelagic), and individual movement patterns (spatially resident to long-distance migrations). We genotyped 242 tiger sharks from 10 globally distributed locations at more than 2000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Although this species often conducts massive distance migrations, the data show strong genetic differentiation at both neutral (fst = 0.125-0.144) and candidate outlier loci (fst = 0.570-0.761) between western atlantic and indo-pacific sharks, suggesting the potential for adaptation to the environments specific to these oceanic regions. Within these regions, there was mixed support for population differentiation between northern and southern hemispheres in the western atlantic, and none for structure within the indian ocean. Notably, the results demonstrate a low level of population differentiation of tiger sharks from the remote hawaiian archipelago compared with sharks from the indian ocean (fst = 0.003-0.005, p < 0.01). Given concerns about biodiversity loss and marine ecosystem impacts caused by overfishing of oceanic sharks in the midst of rapid environmental change, our results suggest it imperative that international fishery management prioritize conservation of the evolutionary potential of the highly genetically differentiated atlantic and indo-pacific populations of this unique apex predator. Furthermore, we suggest targeted management attention to tiger sharks in the hawaiian archipelago based on a precautionary biodiversity conservation perspective.

288,2021,"Apparent absence of the amphibian chytrid fungus (batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) in frogs in malaita province, solomon islands","Pacific Conservation Biology","A major driver of global biodiversity loss is disease. One of the most devastating wildlife diseases known is chytridiomycosis, which is caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, and is implicated in population declines in over 500 frog species. Thought to originate in asia, b. Dendrobatidis now has a global distribution, likely due to human movement and trade. The pathogen has yet to be detected in melanesia, but there have been few surveys for b. Dendrobatidis in the region, and none in the solomon islands archipelago, a biogeographic region with a unique and culturally important frog fauna. We swabbed 200 frogs of eight species in three genera in lowland and highland sites in east kwaio on the island of malaita in the solomon islands. All frogs tested negative for the pathogen but it is possible that the pathogen is present despite non-detection, so further surveys for the pathogen are needed throughout the country. Despite this, it is safest to take a precautionary approach and assume that b. Dendrobatidis has not yet been introduced to the solomon islands, and that naãve native amphibian populations may be at risk of decline if the pathogen is introduced. Protocols are needed to prevent the accidental import of infected frogs via tourism or in logging or mining equipment. Monitoring of frog populations near areas of high risk such as ports is also recommended.

289,2021,"Effects of land-use change on avian taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in a tropical montane rainforest","Diversity And Distributions","Aim: although land use change is a leading cause of biodiversity loss worldwide, there is scant information on the extent to which it has affected the structure and composition of bird communities in the afrotropical region. This study aimed to quantify the effects of habitat transformation on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in afrotropical bird communities. Location: nyungwe landscape, a montane rainforest with adjoining farmland in south-west rwanda. Methods: data on bird occurrence, abundance and functional traits were collected in 2017/18 using point counts. We also collected data on habitat and morphological traits for all bird species recorded. We quantified bird diversity using a range of metrics, including the inverse simpson index, functional dispersion and the standardized effect size of mean nearest taxon distance. Results: in comparison with primary forest areas, even low levels of land use change altered species composition and reduced species diversity. Although overall functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity were similar across land use types, we found a significant contraction of trophic and locomotory trait structures of bird communities in restored areas and cultivated areas, respectively. Soil moisture, elevation and lower vegetation height were major factors influencing taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dimensions of bird communities, although their effects varied across these dimensions. Main conclusions: the sensitivity of forest species to minor habitat disturbance emphasizes the value of conserving primary vegetation. Long-term conservation of bird communities in afromontane ecosystems requires halting wide-scale destruction of primary forest, promoting vegetation heterogeneity in the ecological restoration of degraded habitats and adopting wildlife-friendly agricultural practices. Our results suggest that monitoring and conservation in these landscapes can be refined using taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics to provide complementary information about the current and likely future impacts of land use change.

290,2021,"Consistent declines in aquatic biodiversity across diverse domains of life in rivers impacted by surface coal mining","Ecological Applications","The rivers of appalachia (united states) are among the most biologically diverse freshwater ecosystems in the temperate zone and are home to numerous endemic aquatic organisms. Throughout the central appalachian ecoregion, extensive surface coal mines generate alkaline mine drainage that raises the ph, salinity, and trace element concentrations in downstream waters. Previous regional assessments have found significant declines in stream macroinvertebrate and fish communities after draining these mined areas. Here, we expand these assessments with a more comprehensive evaluation across a broad range of organisms (bacteria, algae, macroinvertebrates, all eukaryotes, and fish) using high-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental dna (edna). We collected water samples from 93 streams in central appalachia (west virginia, united states) spanning a gradient of mountaintop coal mining intensity and legacy to assess how this land use alters downstream water chemistry and affects aquatic biodiversity. For each group of organisms, we identified the sensitive and tolerant taxa along the gradient and calculated stream specific conductivity thresholds in which large synchronous declines in diversity were observed. Streams below mining operations had steep declines in diversity (â18 to â41%) and substantial shifts in community composition that were consistent across multiple taxonomic groups. Overall, large synchronous declines in bacterial, algal, and macroinvertebrate communities occurred even at low levels of mining impact at stream specific conductivity thresholds of 150â200 îs/cm that are substantially below the current u.s. Environmental protection agency aquatic life benchmark of 300 îs/cm for central appalachian streams. We show that extensive coal surface mining activities led to the extirpation of 40% of biodiversity from impacted rivers throughout the region and that current water quality criteria are likely not protective for many groups of aquatic organisms.

291,2021,"The mitigation hierarchy in environmental impact assessment and related legislation as a tool for species conservation: a case study of western chimpanzees and mining development","Biological Conservation","Global biodiversity loss is occurring at an alarming rate, with a growing consensus that we are entering a sixth mass extinction. Rapid human development and associated habitat loss, principally through agriculture, infrastructure and extractive industries, is a significant contributor. The critically endangered western chimpanzee (pan troglodytes verus) is at the nexus of the development-habitat loss conflict with 83% of the subspecies occurring outside protected areas. To protect its habitat, robust regulation of large-scale development, in particular through environmental impact assessment (eia) procedures that adequately incorporate the mitigation hierarchy principles (mhps), is required. We developed a framework to review eia and related legislation in all eight western chimpanzee range countries and assessed how well they incorporate mhps, focusing specifically on mining activity. Costa rica was selected as a benchmark of good practice, based on the recognised quality of its biodiversity laws. Overall performance of the eight countries fell substantially below that of costa rica. Whilst isolated good examples were identified, the overall approach legislates for broad concepts but fails to deliver on detailed provisions. As recommended by the current regional action plan for the conservation of western chimpanzees, all countries would benefit from urgent legislative reform to better incorporate mhps within eia procedures. This study provides recommendations in that regard together with a replicable tool for assessing eia legislation in other jurisdictions.

292,2021,"Conservation status of southeast asian natural habitat estimated using galliformes spatio-temporal range decline","Global Ecology And Conservation","Southeast asia has arguably the highest biodiversity loss due to the high deforestation rate and hunting pressure. In the region, 55 species of the family phasianidae can be found in all available land habitats from lowland plains up to high-elevation mountainous areas. As ground-dwelling birds, these species are sensitive to habitat disturbance and hunting pressure, making them ideal to evaluate the status of remaining southeast asian forest habitats. The aims of this work are, therefore, to define for each phasianidae species: (1) the extent of forest cover, suitable habitat and large forest patches currently available in the region and their decline over the years between 2000 and 2018 (six estimated generations) and (2) assess the threats using a bayesian belief network approach combining data on forest loss hotspots and hunting pressure. Moreover, we defined the spatial distribution of phasianidae diversity hotspots and relative threats in the region. The results show that over the 18-year study period, the forest cover, suitable habitat and phasianidae diversity in southeast asia declined overall. The remaining forest habitats currently have low species diversity and face medium to high threat levels from habitat loss and hunting pressure. Population monitoring and higher protection levels both inside and outside protected areas are essential for the speciesâ long term survival. We recommend using phasianidae as indicator species to monitor the overall habitat conservation status in southeast asia.

293,2021,"Range restriction leads to narrower ecological niches and greater extinction risk in australian freshwater fish","Biodiversity And Conservation","Human-induced environmental changes are accelerating biodiversity loss. Identifying which life-history traits increase extinction risk is important to inform proactive conservation. While geographically or numerically rare species are typically more vulnerable, ecological specialization may also increase extinction risk particularly when associated with rarity. We investigate whether regionally endemic freshwater fishes have more specialized diets and habitat requirements than more widely distributed, closely related species. We then use this information to assess extinction risk. Using closely-related widespread and endemic congeneric pairings from the kimberley region of north-western australia, we investigate whether there are ontogenetic diet shifts in 13 species and if some of these ontogenetic trophic units (otus) have narrow dietary niches. Using qualitative measures of habitat and presence/absence data, we also assess habitat specialization in 32 species. Overall, range-restricted species had narrower ecological niches. Ontogenetic diet shifts existed in 12 of 13 species and range-restricted species were more specialized for some or all of their otus compared to their widespread congenerics. Endemic species had a higher degree of variance in habitat use compared to their widespread congenerics, showing they had more specialized habitat requirements. As specialization is linked to extinction risk, the narrow niche breadth of small-ranged endemic fishes makes them more vulnerable to extinction than more cosmopolitan species. As many endemics from the kimberley region have small ranges and/or low abundances, they may have an increased risk of extinction. By identifying which endemic species have narrow ecological niches, our study provides essential information for targeting proactive conservation efforts.

294,2021,"Potential distribution of piscivores across the atlantic forest: from bats and marsupials to large-bodied mammals under a trophic-guild viewpoint","Ecological Informatics","Biodiversity across the neotropics is a result of selective forces along a myriad of ecosystems. The brazilian atlantic forest biome embodies 321 mammal species; only a small parcel of the species is considered piscivore. The atlantic forest biota is threatened by multiple factors, from habitat loss to climate changes. We aimed to understand the current distribution of the six extant piscivore mammals and the distribution of this trophic guild, predicting their distribution under climate change across the atlantic forest and identifying areas for the trophic guild conservation prioritizations. We used data on species occurrence based on the gbif database and literature, and climatic data from worldclim. We perform species distribution modelling (sdm) to derive the piscivores distribution and the presence of this trophic guild. Our results reveal that piscivores distribution is already restricted in the present (average 8.84%), even the presence of this trophic guild (6.42%). Trophic guild distribution in the short-term under climate change may represent less than 6.5% across the atlantic forest, will be contracting by â30.0%. We conclude that combinations of factors inductors of biodiversity loss will be empowered by climate changes, leading to more restricted species distribution. Sdm is fundamental to understand the species distribution to prioritize conservation efforts from local to pan-continental scales, being paramount to slow down the consequences of climate change.

295,2021,"Shade tree diversity may not drive prey-predator interaction in coffee agroforests of the western ghats biodiversity hotspot, india","Biological Control","Agricultural intensification can decrease biodiversity and ecosystem services they deliver to agroecosystems. Diverse trees-shaded coffee is structurally and functionally complex and has biodiversity adequate for sustainable production of coffee and mitigation of biodiversity loss due to deforestation. However, shade tree simplification is intense in coffee agroforests worldwide, threatening their economic and environmental targets. In south india, native trees have been replaced by silver oak (grevillea robusta) trees. Native trees-shaded coffee is floristically complex and diverse than oak-shaded coffee. We hypothesize that the natural prey removal fares better in native trees-shaded coffee than in oak-shaded coffee. Artificial caterpillar models of three colors were installed rotationally on leaves, stems, and branches of coffee plants in native trees-shaded- and oak-shaded coffee, and assessed the predation rates for fruiting and leaf-flushing periods of coffee to test this. Forty-four percent of the caterpillars were predated. Arthropods, and in particular the ants, were the predominant predators. Lizards followed by birds, and mammals were second, third, and fourth important predators of coffee agroforests. Overall, predation rates did not differ with the shade diversity, but lizard predation rates were higher in diverse trees-shaded coffee than in oak-shaded coffee. The predation rates were slightly higher in the fruiting season of coffee. Predation rates of any predator taxa were higher for the caterpillars placed on stems and branches than on leaves. The study does not support the hypothesis that the natural predation rates might be higher in floristically complex coffee agroforests, but highlights the biocontrol potential of lizards in diverse-shaded coffee.

296,2021,"Advancing sea turtle conservation in the south china sea via u.s.-china diplomacy","Environmental Progress And Sustainable Energy","The south china sea is an important oceanic habitat for endangered sea turtles, which are facing anthropogenic pressures from the illegal wildlife trade, fisheries by-catch, debris pollution, habitat loss, and climate change. Compounding these threats are international disputes over territorial claims in the south china sea, exerting a general disinclination toward regional collaborations to solve environmental issues. Since sea turtles are migratory animals that move through aquatic and terrestrial habitats, feeding in waters, and nesting on beaches under the jurisdiction of multiple countries, the species is an ideal ambassador to raise public support for international collaborations. Transnational communications to coordinate conservation efforts across borders provide a positive agenda of cooperation to build trust, creating a politically neutral platform to facilitate opportunities for diplomacy to reset and improve foreign relations, underscoring the value of sea turtles as a flagship species to reduce international tensions and bring nations together. For this reason, the u.s.-china ecopartnership between sea turtles 911 and hainan normal university was formed to empower local communities to protect the ocean through sea turtle rescue, public education, and scientific research projects. Genetic research determined the geographic origins of illegally traded sea turtles, validating the uniqueness of the paracel (xisha) islands rookery, and urging policymakers to establish a large-scale sea turtle nature reserve in the south china sea. To define boundaries of the proposed marine protected area, sea turtles were tracked with satellite telemetry delineating their migratory routes and habitats across multiple countries, underscoring the importance of international collaborations. Debris pollution survey at a major turtle nesting beach in the paracel islands demonstrated that pollution is negatively impacting newborn turtle hatchlings and that regional cooperation in the south china sea should promote the reduction and cleanup of marine debris. Laparoscopic surgery was performed on sea turtles for the first time in china to assess the gender ratio of the local population, which revealed a female biased ratio, indicative of the effects of climate change. A sea turtle rescue center was jointly established in which more than 100 sea turtles were successfully rescued and released by the international and local community, including students who won national awards for their volunteer service. Implementing grassroots initiatives for sea turtle conservation have become an ideal diplomatic channel to strengthen u.s.-china relations as several diplomats, including u.s. Ambassador max baucus, have engaged in people-to-people exchanges during public educational events. This international partnership serves as a case example in which current political disputes can be set aside to prepare future generations for the existential threat of biodiversity loss and climate change, while increasing peace, stability, and turtles in the region.

The case of golden pride gold mine, tanzania","African Journal Of Ecology","In mining areas, habitat rehabilitation is increasingly being used to minimise biodiversity loss and restore areas of natural habitat. In some mining areas, both exotic and native tree species are used in rehabilitation. For the most part, the effectiveness of using both native and exotic plant species in rehabilitation to attract avifauna is not known. Using a fixed-radius point-count method to sample birds, this study assessed the extent to which sites rehabilitated with exotic plant species attracted local avifauna compared to sites rehabilitated with native plant species, as well as to the unaffected surrounding woodlands. Rehabilitation dominated by exotic species had a lower density of bird species and individuals, lower relative abundance and lower species diversity compared with sites rehabilitated by native plant species and the surrounding woodlands. The results suggest that the use of exotic plant species, l. Leucocephala, should be avoided in rehabilitation. Therefore, for restoration purposes it is desirable to use native tree species in rehabilitation rather than exotic tree species.

298,2021,"Migration strategy as an indicator of resilience to change in two shorebird species with contrasting population trajectories","Journal Of Animal Ecology","Many migratory birds are declining worldwide. In line with the general causes for the global biodiversity crisis, habitat loss, pollution, hunting, over-exploitation and climate change are thought to be at the basis of these population declines. Long-distance migrants seem especially vulnerable to rapid anthropogenic change, yet, the rate of decline across populations and species varies greatly within flyways. We hypothesize that differences in migration strategy, and notably stopover-site use, may be at the basis of these variations in resilience to global change. By identifying and comparing the migration strategies of two very closely related shorebird species, the curlew sandpiper calidris ferruginea and the red-necked stint calidris ruficollis, migrating from the same non-breeding site in australia to similar breeding sites in the high russian arctic, we aimed to explain why these two species express differential resilience to rapid changes within their flyway resulting in different population trajectories in recent times. Based on 13 curlew sandpiper and 16 red-necked stint tracks from light-level geolocator tags, we found that individual curlew sandpipers make use of fewer stopover areas along the flyway compared to red-necked stints. Furthermore, and notably during northward migration, curlew sandpipers have a higher dependency on fewer sites, both in terms of the percentage of individuals visiting key stopover sites and the relative time spent at those sites. While curlew sandpipers rely mainly on the yellow sea region, which has recently experienced a sharp decline in suitable habitat, red-necked stints make use of additional sites and spread their relative time en-route across sites more evenly. Our results indicate that differential migration strategies may explain why curlew sandpipers within the east asian-australasian flyway are declining rapidly (9.5%â5.5% per year) while red-necked stints remain relatively stable (â3.1%â0%). We consider that more generally, the number of sites per individual and among a population, the spatial distribution across the flyway, as well as the relationship between the time spent over sites may prove to be key variables explaining populations and species' differential resilience to environmental change.

299,2021,"Habitat change and biased sampling influence estimation of diversity trends","Current Biology","Recent studies have drawn contrasting conclusions about the extent to which local-scale measures of biodiversity are declining and whether such patterns conflict with the global-scale declines that have attracted much attention.1 a key source of high-quality data for such analyses comes from longitudinal biodiversity studies, which sample a given taxon repeatedly over time at a specific location.2 there has been relatively little consideration of how habitat change might lead to biases in the sampling and continuity of biodiversity time series data, and the consequent potential for bias in the biodiversity trends that result. Here, based on analysis of standardized routes from the north american breeding bird survey (3,014 routes sampled over 18 years),3 we demonstrate that major local habitat change is associated with an increase in the rate of survey cessations. We further show that routes that were continued despite major habitat changes show reduced diversity. By simulating potential rates of loss, we show that the underlying real trends in taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity can even reverse in sign if more than a quarter of diversity is lost from routes that ceased and are thus no longer included in surveys. Our analyses imply that biodiversity loss can be underestimated by biases introduced if continued sampling in longitudinal studies is influenced by local change. We argue that researchers and conservation practitioners should be aware of the potential for bias in such data and seek to use more robust methods to evaluate biodiversity trends and make conservation decisions.

Despite the large number of operational, under-construction, and planned hydroelectric dams, their long-term effects on biodiversity loss are still poorly documented. Here, we investigate avian extinctions resulting from the tucuruã hydroelectric reservoir (thr), the oldest amazonian mega dam, which impounded the tocantins river in 1984. Our avian inventoryâbased on several sampling methods (mist-netting, point-counts, boat census and qualitative surveys) during 280 days of fieldwork from 2005 to 2007âwas combined with an exhaustive search of museum vouchers and digital online databases of citizen science from the lower tocantins river to identify long-term trends in species persistence and extinction in the thr influence area. The regional avifauna was comprised of 479 species, 404 of which were recorded during our fieldwork. Based on recent and historical records spanning 172 years, we found evidence for likely extinctions at thr influence area for 53 (11.06%) species that have remained entirely unreported since 1984. We were further able to estimate extinction probabilities for 20 species; 15 species were considered to be extinct, including psophia interjecta and pyrilia vulturina that are red-listed by iucn. Our study serves as a baseline for avifaunal monitoring in the thr influence area and shows that degree of habitat specialization is a key factor in determining species extinctions caused by nonrandom habitat loss from either inundation or deforestation. Avian species extinctions will most likely continue across the area affected by the reservoir as a direct impact of alluvial forest loss and ongoing habitat degradation of upland forests.

Current worldwide estimates of freshwater fish species threatened with extinction are about 30%. We discuss why standard monitoring of the status of most fishes is inadequate to keep up with declines. Rapid population declines and shrinking freshwater fish distributions result in shifting baselines that make it challenging to evaluate conservation status reliably and promptly and effectively address further decreases. We present the california method for status evaluation of fishes as an alternative to existing methods for assessing the regional status of freshwater fishes. This method uses local expertise to score metrics and generates a fish status rating to inform short-term management decisions. This approach applies to distinct population segments, subspecies, species, and entire regional fish faunas and is adaptable to local, changing environmental conditions.

302,2021,"Gaps in global wildlife trade monitoring leave amphibians vulnerable","Elife","As the biodiversity crisis continues, we must redouble efforts to understand and curb pressures pushing species closer to extinction. One major driver is the unsustainable trade of wildlife. Trade in internationally regulated species gains the most research attention, but this only accounts for a minority of traded species and we risk failing to appreciate the scale and impacts of unregulated legal trade. Despite being legal, trade puts pressure on wild species via: direct collection, introduced pathogens, and invasive species. Smaller species-rich vertebrates, such reptiles, fish, and amphibians, may be particularly vulnerable to trading because of gaps in regulations, small distributions, and demand of novel species. Here we combine data from five sources: online web searches in six languages, cites trade database, lemis trade inventory, iucn assessments, and a recent literature review, to characterise the global trade in amphibians, and also map use by purpose including meat, pets, medicinal and for research. We show that 1,215 species are being traded (17% of amphibian species), almost three times previous recorded numbers, 345 are threatened, and 100 data deficient or unassessed. Traded species origin hotspots include south american, china, and central africa; sources indicate 42% of amphibians are taken from the wild. Newly described species can be rapidly traded (mean time lag of 6.5 years), including threatened and unassessed species. The scale and limited regulation of the amphibian trade, paired with the triptych of connected pressures (collection, pathogens, invasive species), warrants a re-examination of the wildlife trade status-quo, application of the precautionary principle in regards to wildlife trade, and a renewed push to achieve global biodiversity goals.

303,2021,"A near-range plant invasion homogenizes riparian vegetation but leads to more productive bird communities","Ornithological Applications","Biological invasions are a leading driver of biodiversity loss and population declines worldwide. While much research has focused on understanding the effects of long-distance (e.g., cross-continental) invasion, the potential impacts of species that invade close to or within their native ranges are relatively understudied. We investigated the effects of the near-range introduction of a non-native plant, new mexico locust (robinia neomexicana), on riparian plant and bird communities in northwestern colorado, usa. By surveying plant and bird communities and examining nest success and productivity in riparian forest with and without locust, we evaluated the following ecological responses to invasion: (1) tree and shrub richness and density; (2) bird species richness, occupancy, and abundance; and (3) avian reproductive success. Our results demonstrate biotic homogenization of the plant community with increasing intensity of locust invasion, yet we found little evidence for negative effects on avian habitat use or reproductive success. Instead, locust invasion showed a positive effect on nest productivity, with significantly higher brood sizes and numbers of young fledged for nests in invaded habitats compared to those where locust was absent. Because climate change is already leading to shifts in species distribution patterns, we suggest that understanding the ecological consequences of plant invasions that occur within or near historic ranges will advance the science and practice of invasive species biology in a changing world. Our findings of mostly neutral to positive effects of locust suggest that near-range plant invasions may not always negatively impact community structure. Lay summary near-range introductions occur when species are brought to areas close to their native ranges. Though much less studied than traditional long-distance invasions, they have the potential to transform native plant and animal communities. New mexico locust, a fast-growing woody plant, was introduced to a valley in colorado, usa, near its northern range boundary. We collected data on plants and birds in areas with and without locust and found that locust decreased the diversity of plant species but had neutral to positive impacts on the bird community. Nests located in areas with locust produced more nestlings than those in uninvaded sites, suggesting locust may provide benefits for some songbirds, potentially in the form of enhanced nest protection and/or food availability. Near-range introductions are likely to become more common with climate change; our results suggest these introductions may have mixed effects on plant and animal communities.

304,2021,"Snp analyses and acoustic tagging reveal multiple origins and widespread dispersal of invasive brown trout in the falkland islands","Evolutionary Applications","Biological invasions are important causes of biodiversity loss, particularly in remote islands. Brown trout (salmo trutta) have been widely introduced throughout the southern hemisphere, impacting endangered native fauna, particularly galaxiid fishes, through predation and competition. However, due to their importance for sport fishing and aquaculture farming, attempts to curtail the impacts of invasive salmonids have generally been met with limited support and the best prospects for protecting native galaxiids is to predict where and how salmonids might disperse. We analysed 266 invasive brown trout from 14 rivers and ponds across the falkland islands as well as 32 trout from three potential source populations, using a panel of 592â single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and acoustic tagging, to ascertain their origins and current patterns of dispersal. We identified four genetically distinct clusters with high levels of genetic diversity and low admixture, likely reflecting the different origins of the invasive brown trout populations. Our analysis suggests that many trout populations in the falklands may have originated from one of the donor populations analysed (river wey). The highest genetic diversity was observed in the rivers with the greatest number of introductions and diverse origins, while the lowest diversity corresponded to a location without documented introductions, likely colonized by natural dispersal. High levels of gene flow indicated widespread migration of brown trout across the falkland islands, likely aided by anadromous dispersal. This is supported by data from acoustically tagged fish, three of which were detected frequently moving between two rivers ~26â km apart. Our results suggest that, without containment measures, brown trout may invade the last remaining refuges for the native endangered aplochiton spp. We provide new insights into the origin and dispersal of invasive brown trout in the falkland islands that can pave the way for a targeted approach to limit their impact on native fish fauna.

In this paper, we use a replicable method to model bird trends in the period 2000â2015 and the effects of natura 2000 protection, across land cover classes, on regional abundances and local species richness and diversity. We model bird trends in veneto, a north-eastern italian region with areas among the richest in bird species in italy. Bird data were derived from the national breeding bird monitoring scheme. Breeding birds showed declining trends at the regional level, confirming national and continental trends, particularly on agricultural and natural areas. The land cover class, rather than natura 2000, mostly influenced population trends; however, it was possible to observe slightly higher estimates of species richness and diversity in natura 2000 sites. Despite the absolute higher estimates of richness and diversity over the investigated period, farmland and woodland bird species had steeper declining trends inside natura 2000 than outside, matching the values of the areas outside the network at the end of the survey period. We conclude that the natura 2000 network capacity to buffer biodiversity loss and act as a species-pool for non-protected areas is decreasing over time, mainly with regards to farmland and woodland birds. Natura 2000 implementation must be improved: conservation objectives and measures, management, and monitoring should be better integrated into existing plans and funding should be made more efficiently available for natura 2000.

306,2021,"Effects of vegetation structure on avian biodiversity in a selectively logged hill dipterocarp forest","Global Ecology And Conservation","Southeast asian tropical rainforests are shrinking at an alarming rate largely due to anthropogenic activities such as logging and agricultural expansion. The loss of tropical rainforests from human exploitations caused devastating and irreversible impacts on avian biodiversity. The establishment of protected areas is an effective tool to mitigate further forest biodiversity loss. However, the ability of degraded rainforest to support avian biodiversity is still remain little known. Here, we assessed bird assemblages in a hill dipterocarp forest in peninsular malaysia which was selectively logged almost three decades ago. We examined the effects of site-level attributes, particularly vegetation structure on bird community composition, species richness and abundance of selected feeding guild groups (i.e. Insectivorous, carnivorous, and frugivorous). Generally, we found that a selectively logged hill dipterocarp forest can still support a large proportion of forest birds, including those species with high conservation values. Our data also revealed that avian biodiversity was positively related to the number of fallen snags, number of standing snags, number of shrubs, number of trees with dbh < 5 cm, and elevation. In contrast, avian biodiversity was negatively linked to canopy cover percentage, number of palms, and number of trees with dbh 30â50 cm. Our findings suggest the importance of post-harvest site-level attributes management in order to improve avian biodiversity in logged hill dipterocarp forests. Above all, urgent actions are needed to incorporate hill dipterocarp forests, including those already disturbed by logging into protected area networks in peninsular malaysia to mitigate forest biodiversity loss.

307,2021,"Wildlife conservation in a fragmented landscape: the eurasian red squirrel on the isle of wight","Conservation Genetics","Island populations may have a higher extinction risk due to reduced genetic diversity and need to be managed effectively in order to reduce the risk of biodiversity loss. The eurasian red squirrels (sciurus vulgaris) in the south of england only survive on three islands (the isle of wight, brownsea and furzey islands), with the isle of wight harbouring the largest population in the region. Fourteen microsatellites were used to determine the genetic structure of red squirrel populations on the isle of wight, as well as their relatedness to other populations of the species. Our results demonstrated that squirrels on these islands were less genetically diverse than those in continental mainland populations, as would be expected. It also confirmed previous results from mitochondrial dna which indicated that the squirrels on the isle of wight were relatively closely related to brownsea island squirrels in the south of england. Importantly, our findings showed that genetic mixing between squirrels in the east and west of the isle of wight was very limited. Given the potential deleterious effects of small population size on genetic health, landscape management to encourage dispersal of squirrels between these populations should be a priority.

Reforestation may compensate or reduce climate change impacts on species, but this hypothesis has not been tested yet. Here we quantify the additive and synergistic effects of forest change â in particular, reforestation â and climate changes on ten endemic and forest-dependent anurans of the atlantic forest biodiversity hotspot. We estimated climatic and habitat suitability for all species under historical and future (2050) conditions, using niche modeling and forest cover maps from a comprehensive land-use model. We contrasted a pessimistic land-use scenario, with little change in forest cover, with an optimistic scenario, with forest gain through restoration of âlegal reserveâ areas. Our models show that climate change will have species-specific effects on anurans, increasing climatic suitability for seven species, but decreasing for three. For these three species, we predict that forest gain can compensate the negative impact of climate change, increasing overall environmental suitability. These results reinforce the importance of ensuring reforestation and forest protection as a climate change adaptation strategy for biodiversity.

309,2021,"Urbanization negatively impacts frog diversity at continental, regional, and local scales","Basic And Applied Ecology","Urban environments are novel ecosystems, with increased chemical, sound, and light pollution differentially impacting many animals. Understanding the impacts of urban environments on biodiversity is the first step to understanding how to best mitigate biodiversity losses in an increasingly urbanizing world. Analyses with broad geographic and taxonomic coverage can offer critical context for informing urban biodiversity conservation. But such studies are currently lacking, especially for under-studied, but likely highly impacted, taxa such as frogs. Our objective was to document frog diversity in relation to urban environments at continental, regional, and local scales. We used frogid data, â an opportunistic citizen science dataset generated by volunteers recording calling frogs using a smartphone and validated by experts â throughout continental australia, to calculate species richness, shannon diversity, and phylogenetic diversity of frogs in urban and non-urban areas, as well as along a continuous urbanization gradient. The overall species richness of frogs was, on average, 57% less in urban than non-urban areas across six ecoregions. Further, we found significantly lower frog diversity in urban environments compared with non-urban environments across the country, with an average reduction of 59% species richness, 86% shannon diversity, and 72% phylogenetic diversity. We also found evidence for a steady decrease in frog diversity along an urbanization gradient, with no obvious thresholds. Our results highlight the negative impacts of urbanization, â at a continental scale, â on frog diversity, and clearly highlight the necessity to consider frog diversity in future urban land development decisions.

310,2021,"Urbanization effects on temporal variations of avian haemosporidian infections","Environmental Research","Urbanization is an important human-driven process that leads to biodiversity loss and alters the interactions between organisms, including disease transmission. Although urbanization affects both host and vector communities, the effects on vector-borne pathogens are still poorly understood. Here, we monitored variation in prevalence and richness of three common blood parasites in birds (plasmodium, haemoproteus and leucocytozoon) from localities with different land uses (urban, rural and natural) during two consecutive years (2013 and 2014). Overall, 1400 juvenile house sparrows (passer domesticus) from 15 localities in southern spain were included in this study. Haemoproteus and leucocytozoon prevalence was higher in 2013 than in 2014, particularly in urban and natural habitats for the case of leucocytozoon. Prevalence was correlated between years for haemoproteus and leucocytozoon, independently of the habitat. Additionally, rural habitats harboured significantly higher haemoproteus lineage richness compared to urban and natural habitats during 2014. Leucocytozoon lineage richness was negatively correlated between years in rural habitats but positively correlated in urban and natural habitats in comparison. Parasite lineages found in birds were homogeneously distributed along habitats and years and the common lineages prevalence were not influenced by them. Our results highlight different patterns of infection depending on the parasite genera probably related to the composition and density of vector communities. The specific reproductive environmental requirements of the different groups of vectors involved in the transmission may be affected by climatic conditions and landscape features.

311,2021,"Niche differences may reduce susceptibility to competition between native and non-native birds in oceanic islands","Diversity And Distributions","Aim: few bird extinctions on oceanic island have been attributed to competition with non-native species, even though it might be an overlooked driver of biodiversity loss. We evaluate the potential competition between native and non-native island bird species, identifying species and island characteristics that enhance it and may promote future extinctions. Location: seventy-three (>100 km2) oceanic islands worldwide. Methods: we compiled a species list for each island and used single-trait meta-analyses to assess differences between native and non-native species. Then, we used single-trait beta regression models to identify species traits linked to potential competition. Finally, we used a trait-based approach to calculate the potential competition between native and non-native species on each island and identify island characteristics linked to potential competition. Results: native bird species tended to be smaller forest dwellers, that were either carnivore, frugivore or insectivore, and that foraged in flight, in the canopy or at mid-height. In contrast, non-native birds tended to be open habitat granivores, that were either ground or unspecialized foragers. Potential competition tended to be higher for native species with typical non-native traits and forest-dwelling unspecialized non-native species. Potential competition between native and non-native birds was consistently higher in islands that were larger, had more non-native birds or were drier. Main conclusions: niche differentiation of native and non-native species may explain the scarcity of reported competition-driven extinctions since non-natives clearly tend to favour and are better adapted to anthropogenic environments. However, the few non-native birds that occur in native ecosystems may be problematic. The loss of native ecosystems coupled with the introduction of species that might outcompete native species may enhance the relevance of competition in future island extinctions. Â© 2021 the authors.

312,2021,"Increased connectivity and depth improve the effectiveness of marine reserves","Global Change Biology","Marine reserves are a key tool for the conservation of marine biodiversity, yet only ~2.5% of the world's oceans are protected. The integration of marine reserves into connected networks representing all habitats has been encouraged by international agreements, yet the benefits of this design has not been tested empirically. Australia has one of the largest systems of marine reserves, providing a rare opportunity to assess how connectivity influences conservation success. An australia-wide dataset was collected using baited remote underwater video systems deployed across a depth range from 0 to 100â m to assess the effectiveness of marine reserves for protecting teleosts subject to commercial and recreational fishing. A meta-analytical comparison of 73 fished species within 91 marine reserves found that, on average, marine reserves had 28% greater abundance and 53% greater biomass of fished species compared to adjacent areas open to fishing. However, benefits of protection were not observed across all reserves (heterogeneity), so full subsets generalized additive modelling was used to consider factors that influence marine reserve effectiveness, including distance-based and ecological metrics of connectivity among reserves. Our results suggest that increased connectivity and depth improve the aforementioned marine reserve benefits and that these factors should be considered to optimize such benefits over time. We provide important guidance on factors to consider when implementing marine reserves for the purpose of increasing the abundance and size of fished species, given the expected increase in coverage globally. We show that marine reserves that are highly protected (no-take) and designed to optimize connectivity, size and depth range can provide an effective conservation strategy for fished species in temperate and tropical waters within an overarching marine biodiversity conservation framework.

313,2021,"Using the available indicators of potential biodiversity damage for life cycle assessment on soybean crop according to brazilian ecoregions","Ecological Indicators","The purpose of the study was to evaluate the use of and suggest possible adjustments to indicators of biodiversity loss for lca proposed by chaudhary and books (2018). For this, we analyzed soybean production in brazil. Potential damage to biodiversity has been determined for all brazilian ecoregions: the amazon; the atlantic forest; caatinga; cerrado; pampas; and the pantanal. Two dimensions of assessment were considered â global and regional â in addition to average-country. An adjustment was proposed for the vulnerability coefficient to the indicators average-country brazil: the regional species fragility index (fi). Two inventories were created using two different functional units: area of production of soybean by ecoregion (year m2); and area corresponding to production of 1 kg of soybean (year m2). Thus, we observed that when the indicators of aggregate values were adopted, the atlantic forest was the ecoregion most affected by the crop. Regarding the assessments of the potential biodiversity damage (bd) global and regional indicators, the atlantic forest and the amazon were the ecoregions that suffered the highest impacts, mainly on plants, birds and amphibians taxa. Besides, the impacts at the global level were always more expressive than the regional ones. Due to this, we noticed that the results were influenced by the vulnerability score (vs). The suitability of the vs for fi is relevant and the adjustment in the equation can be suggested for other regions. Considering the results found here, to prevent regional impacts, technical measures such as extensive farming and crop rotation should be prioritized as impact mitigation actions. However, political measures tend to be more effective at geographic levels when addressing more than one ecoregion, due to the standardization of preservation procedures. Thus, from the results reported here, we conclude that the fi is relevant to diagnose measures at the administrative geographic levels of the ecoregions present in a single country, and the applied indicators reinforce that the atlantic forest ecoregion is the most vulnerable due to the replacement of wild forest for cultivated areas, which includes soybean crops.

314,2021,"Estimation of ecological water supplement for typical bird protection in the yellow river delta wetland","Ecological Indicators","With abundant resources in the wetland, the yellow river delta provides important habitats for various kinds of rare bird species. However, due to climate change and human water withdrawal activities, no-flow events of the yellow river occurred frequently since the 1970s, resulting in serious wetland degradation and biodiversity losses. Ecological water supplement has been regarded as one of the most effective measures to cope with these environmental problems. Accordingly, how much water is required for the ecological restoration becomes an essential question to be answered. Since the primary function of the yellow river delta natural reserve (yrdnr), the typical wetland in the yellow river delta, is to provide suitable habitats for various rare birds, the purpose of this paper is to propose a method based on water balance analysis to specify monthly ecological water supplement for the habitats of typical birds in the yrdnr. Specifically, three typical birds were selected as the protection objects, including grus japonensis, ciconia boyciana, and larus saundersi. Monthly water supplement was determined by monthly long-term time series data (2003â2018) of evapotranspiration product derived from remote sensing and meteorological data (precipitation and pan evaporation) acquired from national meteorological information center. The results showed that the annual ecological water supplement for 10 km2 ideal habitats was 666.17ã104 m3, 1165.22ã104 m3, and 664.48ã104 m3 for g. Japonensis, c. Boyciana, and l. Saundersi, respectively. Besides, it was found that annual precipitation generally had a significant negative relation with annual ecological water supplement, which suggested that local precipitation should be considered as a key factor in determining the amount of annual water supplement. The frequency analysis was then implemented to provide reasonable scheme of actual ecological water supplement under different precipitation scenarios. The results indicated that annual ecological water supplement for the whole yrdnr was 1.81ã108 m3, 1.94ã108 m3, 2.10ã108 m3 and 2.25ã108 m3 respectively under wet, average, dry and extreme dry conditions. If water storage measurements are implemented to store surplus precipitation under rainy season, the average volume would reduce by nearly 10%.

315,2021,"Effects of protected areas on survival of threatened gibbons in china","Conservation Biology","Establishing protected areas (pas) is an essential strategy to reduce biodiversity loss. However, many pas do not provide adequate protection due to poor funding, inadequate staffing and equipment, and ineffective management. As part of china's recent economic growth, the chinese government has significantly increased investment in nature reserves over the past 20 years, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate whether pas can protect threatened species effectively. We compiled data from published literature on populations of gibbons (hylobatidae), a threatened taxon with cultural significance, that occurred in chinese reserves after 1980. We evaluated the ability of these pas to maintain gibbon habitat and populations by comparing forest cover and human disturbance between reserves and their surrounding areas and modeling the impact of reserve characteristics on gibbon population trends. We also assessed the perspective of reserve staff concerning pa management effectiveness through an online survey. Reserves effectively protected gibbon habitat by reducing forest loss and human disturbance; however, half the reserves lost their gibbon populations since being established. Gibbons were more likely to survive in reserves established more recently, at higher elevation, with less forest loss and lower human impact, and that have been relatively well studied. A larger initial population size in the 1980s was positively associated with gibbon persistence. Although staff of all reserves reported increased investment and improved management over the past 20â30 years, no relationship was found between management effectiveness and gibbon population trends. We suggest early and emphatic intervention is critical to stop population decline and prevent extinction.

316,2021,"Skin defenses of north american salamanders against a deadly salamander fungus","Animal Conservation","The recently emerged fungal pathogen, batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (bsal) causes the lethal skin disease chytridiomycosis in susceptible salamander species and is predicted to emerge within the americas with devastating consequences. Host responses to bsal are variable but the factors underlying these differences are unknown. To investigate the role of skin-associated immune defenses against bsal and the closely related, b. Dendrobatidis (bd), we sampled skin peptides from wild and captive north american salamanders (spotted salamanders [ambystoma maculatum], nâ =â 10; hellbenders [cryptobranchus alleganiensis], nâ =â 2; red-legged salamanders [plethodon shermani], nâ =â 18; and ocoee salamanders [desmognathus ocoee], nâ =â 15) and conducted inâ vitro experimental assays to test whether salamander skin peptides inhibit chytrid growth. Interspecies differences in skin defenses against bsal and bd, and peptide mixtures were also assessed using a standardized measure and rp-hplc, respectively. For a. Maculatum, skin peptides inhibited bsal and bd growth, consistent with known bsal resistance. Cryptobranchus alleganiensis skin peptides inhibited the growth of bsal but not bd. Plethodon shermani and d. Ocoee skin peptides facilitated bsal growth and had either no effect or inconsistent effects on bd growth. With the exception of a. Maculatum, most species had relatively weak skin defenses against both chytrid pathogens. Collectively, we demonstrate that salamander skin peptide defenses against chytrid pathogens are highly variable and not always equally effective against bsal and bd. By advancing knowledge about the factors underlying chytrid susceptibility, particularly bsal, our findings will help inform conservation initiatives aimed at reducing disease impacts and biodiversity loss.

317,2021,"Climate and land use changes shift the distribution and dispersal of two umbrella species in the hindu kush himalayan region","Science Of The Total Environment","Biodiversity loss from climate and land use change is a global occurrence, but is of particular concern in more prominent biodiverse and sensitive areas such as the hindu kush himalayan (hkh) region. This region harbors two species of geographically separated brown bear (ursus arctos) - the tibetan (u. A. Pruinosus) and himalayan brown bear (u. A. Isabellinus). Both serve as important umbrella species, providing many ecological benefits to their surrounding ecosystems. However, how these two species from the same taxonomic group but with distinct geographical ranges, will respond to climate and land use change is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to predict the potential impacts of future climate and land use change on the distribution and dispersal paths of tibetan and himalayan brown bears in the hkh region. We applied maxent modeling to predict the distribution of the two bear species both currently and for the year 2070, using three general circulation models and three scenarios of climate and land use change. We then identified potential dispersal paths using circuit theory. Results showed that both species would be negatively affected by the climate and land use change expected in the 2070s. In all three climate scenarios, their distribution areas would both shrink and shift to higher altitudes. Throughout the hkh region, tibetan and himalayan brown bears were predicted to lose over 34% and 32% of currently inhabited area under the most severe climate scenario, respectively. In addition, results showed that the density of dispersal paths for tibetan brown bear would decrease while dispersal resistance would increase, and that dispersal paths for himalayan brown bears would shift to higher latitudes. To protect these species, the currently suitable distribution areas and dispersal paths should be considered as priority protected areas. Our findings provide a scientific basis for allocating protected areas in the hkh region that are effective under the context of global climate change, and for establishing transboundary cooperation in the hkh region.

The different types of land use were determined together with the presence/absence, abundance and size class of the different reptile species. The results showed that areas with high anthropic pressure had a lower diversity of species, as well as a less balanced community structure, that could put at risk the effective recruitment and hence the maintenance of the reptile populations in these areas.

319,2021,"Climate and land-use changes interact to drive long-term reorganization of riverine fish communities globally","Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America","As climate change unfolds, changes in population dynamics and species distribution ranges are expected to fundamentally reshuffle communities worldwide. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and extent of community reorganization remains elusive. This is particularly true in riverine systems, which are simultaneously exposed to changing temperature and streamflow, and where land-use change continues to be a major driver of biodiversity loss. Here, we use the most comprehensive compilation of fish abundance time series to date to provide a global synthesis of climate- and lu-induced effects on riverine biota with respect to changes in species thermal and streamflow affinities. We demonstrate that fish communities are increasingly dominated by thermophilic (warm-water) and limnophilic (slow-water) species. Despite being consistent with trends in water temperature and streamflow observed over recent decades, these community changes appear largely decoupled from each other and show wide spatial variation. We further reveal a synergy among climate- and land use-related drivers, such that community thermophilization is heightened in more human-modified systems. Importantly, communities in which species experience thermal and flow regimes that approach or exceed their tolerance thresholds (high community sensitivity), as well as species-poor communities (low community resilience), also display faster rates of compositional change. This research illustrates that quantifying vulnerability of riverine systems to climate change requires a broadening from a narrower thermal focus to more integrative approaches that account for the spatially varying and multifaceted sensitivity of riverine organisms to the interactive effects of water temperature, hydrology, and other anthropogenic changes.

Understanding what drives the adoption of conservation initiatives provides key insights into how initiatives expand to a scale necessary for effective conservation outcomes. In this article, we identified characteristics of conservation initiatives, adopters, and context that influenced the adoption of extensive wildlife management units (umas) in mexico. We interviewed 22 experts to gather their perceptions about the factors driving the adoption and spread of umas, and their interactions. We used diffusion of innovation theory and qualitative data analysis to develop a theory of change based on the experts' perceptions that illustrates what led landholders to adopt umas. We found that: (a) the adoption of umas depended on the landholders' ability to learn about, register, and implement them; (b) alignment with the landholders' objectives and private tenure facilitated adoption, reflecting the likelihood and ease of participation, respectively; and (c) observability of benefits and the availability of technical advice were key to adoption, influencing the speed of adoption by facilitating learning. Our empirically derived theory of change describing the adoption of umas revealed focused and clear hypotheses that can be further tested quantitatively. Â© 2021 the authors.

However, created or restored wetlands could partially mitigate aquatic biodiversity loss by increasing the amount of available habitat across a landscape. We investigated the impact of surrounding terrestrial habitat and water quality variables on suitability for two species of pond-breeding amphibians (bullfrogs [lithobates catesbeianus] and blanchard's cricket frogs [acris blanchardi]) in created permanent wetlands located on an agricultural landscape. We examined tadpole growth and survival in field enclosures placed in ponds surrounded by agricultural, forested, or grassland habitats. We also evaluated the potential for carryover effects of the aquatic environment on terrestrial growth and overwinter survival of cricket frog metamorphs. We found that habitat adjacent to ponds did not predict tadpole growth or survival. Rather, phytoplankton abundance, which showed high variability among ponds within habitat type, was the only predictor of tadpole growth. Cricket frogs emerged larger and earlier from ponds with higher phytoplankton abundance; bullfrogs were also larger and at a more advanced developmental stage in ponds with higher levels of phytoplankton. Overwinter survival of cricket frogs was explained by size at metamorphosis and there were no apparent carryover effects of land use or pond-of-origin on overwinter growth and survival. Our results demonstrate that created ponds in human-dominated landscapes can provide suitable habitat for some anurans, independent of the adjacent terrestrial habitat.

We used failure time analysis to compare latency to explore and move during exploration in a novel environment test (net). Our analyses detected differences in certain movement behaviors (latencies to move during net), indicating that individuals from fragmented forests are slow explorers in relation to individuals from the continuous forest. We also found shorter tarsi and tails in the fragmented forest population which were attributed to an overall reduction in body size in these populations. Our results suggest that environmental change driven by fragmentation in an urban landscape is causing population differentiation, but we cannot ascribe observed variations to evolutionary processes only, as the differences observed may be explained by other processes too. However, we suggest that phenotypic differences may be aiding this small understory forest specialist to persist in an urban fragmented landscape.

323,2021,"Asynchrony drives plant and animal community stability in mediterranean coastal dunes","Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","Substantial evidence now suggests that a positive diversityâstability relationship exists. Yet few studies examine the facets of biodiversity that contribute to this relationship, and empirical research is predominantly conducted on grassland communities under controlled conditions. We investigate the roles of species richness, environmental condition (vegetation cover), asynchrony, and weighted population stability in driving community stability across multiple taxa. We used data from a long-term ecological research project to investigate temporal stability of annual plants, beetles, reptiles, and rodents in nizzanim coastal sand dune nature reserve in israel. All four taxa had a strong positive relationship between asynchrony and community stability. Only rodents showed a positive richnessâstability relationship. Perennial plant cover had a significant relationship with community stability for three taxa, but the direction of the correlation varied. Asynchrony had a stronger relationship with perennial plant cover than it did with richness for both plants and beetles. We suggest that community stability is driven by asynchrony for flora as well as fauna. Stability appears to be determined by speciesâ interactions and their responses to the environment, and not always by diversity. This has important consequences for understanding the effects of environmental degradation on ecosystem stability and productivity, which have destabilizing consequences beyond biodiversity loss.

324,2021,"Bold frogs or shy toads? How did the covid-19 closure of zoological organisations affect amphibian activity?","Animals","Amphibians are an understudied group in the zoo-focussed literature. Whilst commonly housed in specialist exhibits and of real conservation value due to the global extinction crisis, amphibian welfare is not often investigated empirically in zoo settings. The limited research that is available suggests that enclosure design (structure, planting and naturalistic theming) has a positive impact on the time that amphibians will be on show to visitors. However, the categorisation of any âvisitor effectâ (i.e., influences of visitor presence on amphibian activity and time on display) is hard to find. The covid-19 pandemic forced the closure of zoological organisations in the uk for several months from march 2020, with gradual re-openings from the summer into autumn and winter. This event provided a unique opportunity to study the effect of the lack of visitors, the presence of essential zoo staff only, the wider return of organisational staff, and then the return of visitors over a prolonged period. This project at wwt slimbridge wetlands centre assessed the number of individuals of six species of amphibianâcommon toad (bufo bufo), common frog (rana temporaria), smooth newt (lissotriton vulgaris), pool frog (pelophylax lessonae), golden mantella (mantella aurantiaca) and golden poison dart frog (phyllobates terribilis)âvisible to observers under different conditions. All amphibians were housed in a purpose-built indoor exhibit of individual enclosures and were recorded when visible (as a proportion of the total population of the enclosure) during closure, the return of extra centre staff and visitor periods. The results showed species-specific differences in visibility, with some species of amphibian being more likely to be on view when the presence of people at their enclosure was less likely or in smaller numbers. Such differences are likely related to the specific camouflage or anti-predation tactics in these focal species. Further study to quantify amphibian sensitivity to, and perception of, environmental change caused by public presence (e.g., light levels and sound) would be useful welfare-themed research extensions. Our results can help inform husbandry, collection planning and amphibian enclosure design to reduce any noticeable visitor effects, and provide a useful benchmark for further, more complex, welfare assessment measures.

325,2021,"Implications of global environmental change for the burden of snakebite","Toxicon: X","Snakebite envenoming is a set of intoxication diseases that disproportionately affect people of poor socioeconomic backgrounds in tropical countries. As it is highly dependent on the environment its burden is expected to shift spatially with global anthropogenic environmental (climate, land use) and demographic change. The mechanisms underlying the changes to snakebite epidemiology are related to factors of snakes and humans. The distribution and abundance of snakes are expected to change with global warming via their thermal tolerance, while rainfall may affect the timing of key activities like feeding and reproduction. Human population growth is the primary cause of land-use change, which may impact snakes at smaller spatial scales than climate via habitat and biodiversity loss (e.g. Prey availability). Human populations, on the other hand, could experience novel patterns and morbidity of snakebite envenoming, both as a result of snake responses to environmental change and due to the development of agricultural adaptations to climate change, socioeconomic and cultural changes, development and availability of better antivenoms, personal protective equipment, and mechanization of agriculture that mediate risk of encounters with snakes and their outcomes. The likely global effects of environmental and demographic change are thus context-dependent and could encompass both increasing and or snakebite burden (incidence, number of cases or morbidity), exposing new populations to snakes in temperate areas due to âtropicalizationâ, or by land use change-induced snake biodiversity loss, respectively. Tackling global change requires drastic measures to ensure large-scale ecosystem functionality. However, as ecosystems represent the main source of venomous snakes their conservation should be accompanied by comprehensive public health campaigns. The challenges associated with the joint efforts of biodiversity conservation and public health professionals should be considered in the global sustainability agenda in a wider context that applies to neglected tropical and zoonotic and emerging diseases.

326,2021,"Reptiles as food: predation of australian reptiles by introduced red foxes compounds and complements predation by cats","Wildlife Research","Context: invasive species are a major cause of biodiversity loss across much of the world, and a key threat to australia's diverse reptile fauna. There has been no previous comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of the introduced european red fox, vulpes vulpes, on australian reptiles. Aims: we seek to provide an inventory of all australian reptile species known to be consumed by the fox, and identify characteristics of squamate species associated with such predation. We also compare these tallies and characteristics with reptile species known to be consumed by the domestic cat, felis catus, to examine whether predation by these two introduced species is compounded (i.e. Affecting much the same set of species) or complementary (affecting different groups of species). Methods: we collated records of australian reptiles consumed by foxes in australia, with most records deriving from fox dietary studies (tallying >35 000 samples). We modelled presence or absence of fox predation records against a set of biological and other traits, and population trends, for squamate species. Key results: in total, 108 reptile species (â¼11% of australia's terrestrial reptile fauna) have been recorded as consumed by foxes, fewer than that reported for cats (263 species). Eighty-six species have been reported to be eaten by both predators. More australian turtle species have been reported as consumed by foxes than by cats, including many that suffer high levels of predation on egg clutches. Twenty threatened reptile species have been reported as consumed by foxes, and 15 by cats. Squamate species consumed by foxes are more likely to be undergoing population decline than those not known to be consumed by foxes. The likelihood of predation by foxes increased with squamate species' adult body mass, in contrast to the relationship for predation by cats, which peaked at â¼217 g. Foxes, but not cats, were also less likely to consume venomous snakes. Conclusions: the two introduced, and now widespread, predators have both compounding and complementary impacts on the australian reptile fauna. Implications: enhanced and integrated management of the two introduced predators is likely to provide substantial conservation benefits to much of the australian reptile fauna.

327,2021,"Rock removal associated with agricultural intensification will exacerbate the loss of reptile diversity","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Rocky environments host rich levels of biodiversity and provide vital habitat for specialised organisms, range-restricted species and a broad range of ectotherms adapted to saxicoline environments. In australia, rock habitat is being destroyed during soil amelioration practices associated with agricultural intensification. Advances in rock crushing technology, developed to expand or increase crop yields and efficiency, pose an undocumented threat to global biodiversity, especially reptiles dependent on non-renewable rock habitat in agricultural landscapes. Rock removal is a legislated key threatening process in parts of australia and will accelerate biodiversity loss if not mitigated. We estimated reptile speciesâ range overlap with dryland cropping and modified pastoral regions within the australian wheat-sheep zone to assess the potential impacts of rock crushing practices. We examined species- and family-richness within the impact zone and across bioregions within the impact zone, to identify areas where rock removal has the greatest potential to impact terrestrial and fossorial squamates. Our analysis revealed that 159 potentially impacted reptile species occur within the study area, representing 16% of australian terrestrial squamates. Fourteen of these species, including six threatened species, have more than 50% range overlap with areas of intensive agriculture, and include several endangered pygopodids, scincids and agamids. Bioregions rich in rock and burrow-dwelling reptiles include the brigalow belt south, murray darling depression, darling riverine plains, eyre yorke block, avon wheatbelt, nandewar, flinders lofty block and new south wales south western slopes. Synthesis and applications. The conservation of reptiles in agricultural landscapes requires appropriate management and retention of surface rocks. Potential yield increases from destroying rock habitat to intensify or expand cropland will not compensate for the net loss of reptile populations dependent on non-renewable resources. Financial incentives to prevent the expansion and transformation of non-arable landscapes to cropland are required to prevent the ongoing loss of biodiversity.

328,2021,"Automated retrieval of information on threatened species from online sources using machine learning","Methods In Ecology And Evolution","As resources for conservation are limited, gathering and analysing information from digital platforms can help investigate the global biodiversity crisis in a cost-efficient manner. Development and application of methods for automated content analysis of digital data sources are especially important in the context of investigating humanânature interactions. In this study, we introduce novel application methods to automatically collect and analyse textual data on species of conservation concern from digital platforms. An end-to-end pipeline is constructed that begins from searching and downloading news articles about species listed in appendixâ i of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (cites) along with news articles from specific twitter handles and proceeds with implementing natural language processing and machine learning methods to filter and retain only relevant articles. A crucial aspect here is the automatic annotation of training data, which can be challenging in many machine learning applications. A named entity recognition model is then used to extract additional relevant information for each article. The data collected over a 1-month period included 15,088 articles focusing on 585 species listed in appendixâ i of cites. The accuracy of the neural network to detect relevant articles was 95.91% while the named entity recognition model helped extract information on prices, location and quantities of traded animals and plants. A regularly updated database, which can be queried and analysed for various research purposes and to inform conservation decision making, is generated by the system. The results demonstrate that natural language processing can be used successfully to extract information from digital text content. The proposed methods can be applied to multiple digital data platforms at the same time and used to investigate humanânature interactions in conservation science and practice. Â© 2021 the authors.

329,2021,"Trojan hosts: the menace of invasive vertebrates as vectors of pathogens in the southern cone of south america","Biological Invasions","Invasive alien species (ias) can act as vectors for the introduction of pathogens in ecosystems and their transmission to threatened native species (tns), leading to biodiversity loss, population reductions and extinctions. We assessed pathogens potentially occurring in a set of ias in the southern cone of south america and identified tns potentially vulnerable to their effects. Also, we assessed how risk analysis systems proposed or adopted by national authorities in the study region value the importance of pathogens. We identified 324 pathogens in the selected ias, which could potentially affect 202 tns. Wild boar (sus scrofa) was the ias with the largest number of pathogens (91), followed by domestic dog (canis familiaris) (62), red deer (cervus elaphus) (58), rock dove (columba livia) (37), american vison (neovison vison) (18), european hare (lepus europaeus) (17), common starling (sturnus vulgaris) (12), common slider (trachemys scripta) (6), and american bullfrog (lithobates catesbeianus) (2). Most tns were in the âvulnerableâ iucn category, followed by âendangeredâ and âcritically endangeredâ species. Bacteria were the most frequently represented pathogens (112), followed by ectoparasites (78), viruses (69), protozoa and other (65). The direct effects of ias on native wildlife are beginning to be addressed in south america, and their potential impact as pathogen spreaders to native wildlife has remained largely unexplored. Risk analysis systems associated with the introduction of ias are scarce in this region. Although the existing systems contemplate hazard analyses for the co-introduction of pathogens, they underestimate the potential impact of diseases on tns. Conservation efforts in the region would benefit from systems which give pathogen risk a relevant place, and from government agencies promoting targeted disease surveillance in ias and wildlife.

330,2021,"Water quality and ecological risks in european surface waters â monitoring improves while water quality decreases","Environment International","Aquatic ecosystems are at risk of being impaired by various organic chemicals, however comprehensive large-scale evaluations of waterbodiesâ status and trends are rare. Here, surface water monitoring data, gathered as part of the eu water framework directive and comprising the occurrence of 352 organic contaminants (>8.3 mil. Measurements; 2001â2015; 8213 sites) in 31 european countries, was used to evaluate past and current environmental risks for three aquatic species groups: fish, invertebrates, plants. Monitoring quality indices were defined per country and found to improve over time. Relationships became apparent between countriesâ monitoring quality index and their success in detecting contaminants. Across the eu, contaminants were more frequently found in recent years. Overall, 35.7% (n = 17,484) of sites exceeded at least one acute regulatory threshold level (rtl) each year, and average risks significantly increased over time for fish (î¤ = 0.498, p = 0.01) and aquatic invertebrates (î¤ = 0.429, p = 0.03). This indicates an increased chemical pressure to europe's waterbodies and overall large-scale threshold exceedances. Pesticides were identified as the main risk drivers (>85% of rtl exceedances) with aquatic invertebrates being most acutely at risk in europe. Agricultural land-use was clearly identified as the primary spatial driver of the observed aquatic risks throughout european surface waters. Issues in monitoring data heterogeneity were highlighted and also followed by subsequent improvement recommendations, strengthening future environmental quality assessments. Overall, aquatic ecosystem integrity remains acutely at risk across europe, signaling the demand for continued improvements.

331,2021,"Salamander loss alters litter decomposition dynamics","Science Of The Total Environment","Biodiversity loss affects ecosystem functioning. Top down effects of amphibian declines on the trophic food web of the forest floor are poorly understood. Here we quantify and explain the effects of disease-driven loss of salamanders on the dynamics of forest leaf litter. Using paired mesocosms, within a belgian forest, we tested the effect of fire salamander (salamandra salamandra) presence on the trophic cascade that results in the decomposition rate of good quality (maple - acer pseudoplatanus) and poorer quality (oak - quercus robur) leaf litter, over an 18 month period. The presence of salamanders reduced decomposition rate of quercus litter up to 20%. This was associated with a significantly higher predation rate on detritivores, which altered the functional composition of the invertebrate community. Functional composition analysis of the litter microbiome showed less bacteria associated with leaf litter degradation on the quercus litter in the presence of salamanders. Salamanders thus influence ecosystem functions through trophic cascades and promote the retention of the leaf litter fraction in poorer quality litter.

332,2021,"Large herbivore loss has complex effects on mosquito ecology and vector-borne disease risk","Transboundary And Emerging Diseases","Loss of biodiversity can affect transmission of infectious diseases in at least two ways: by altering host and vector abundance or by influencing host and vector behaviour. We used a large herbivore exclusion experiment to investigate the effects of wildlife loss on the abundance and feeding behaviour of mosquito vectors and to explore consequences for vector-borne disease transmission. Large herbivore loss affected both mosquito abundance and blood-feeding behaviour. For aedes mcintoshi, the dominant mosquito species in our study and a primary vector of rift valley fever virus (rvfv), abundance decreased with large herbivore loss, while blood feeding on humans increased. Despite an elevated human biting rate in the absence of large herbivores, we estimated that the potential for rvfv transmission to humans doubles in the presence of large herbivores. These results demonstrate that multiple effects of biodiversity loss on vectors can lead to counterintuitive outcomes for human disease risk.

Based on the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs model, geographical detector model and generalized linear mixed model, the responses of habitat quality and animal biodiversity to grazing activities at 5 km grid scale were analyzed. Results showed that the overall habitat quality on the qtp was high with 76.43% of the total area, and poor level accounted for 19.56%. High level habitat was mainly distributed in the southern part, while the poor level in the northern part. The mean grazing activity explanatory ability to habitat quality, bird species richness and mammal richness were 0.346, 0.430, and 0.354. The interaction effects between slope and grazing activities on habitat quality, bird species richness and mammal richness were the most important interaction effects, and the area affected by the interaction was 73.82, 46.00, and 46.17% of habitat quality, bird species richness and mammal richness, respectively. The interaction effects on habitat quality, bird species richness and mammal richness all showed âlow in the northwest and high in the southeastâ. Grazing activities and habitat quality had a positive correlation while bird species richness, and mammal richness negative correlations. The spatial relationship of grazing activities of habitat quality was âhigher in the middle and lower around the peripheryâ, while the spatial distribution of grazing activities of bird species richness and mammal richness was âhigher in the east and lower in the westâ. This study explicitly revealed the responses of habitat quality and animal biodiversity to grazing activities, thus providing references for biodiversity conservation on the qtp.

335,2021,"Habitat segregation of plate phenotypes in a rapidly expanding population of three-spined stickleback","Ecosphere","Declines of large predatory fish due to overexploitation are restructuring food webs across the globe. It is now becoming evident that restoring these altered food webs requires addressing not only ecological processes, but evolutionary ones as well, because human-induced rapid evolution may in turn affect ecological dynamics. We studied the potential for niche differentiation between different plate armor phenotypes in a rapidly expanding population of a small prey fish, the three-spined stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus). In the central baltic sea, three-spined stickleback abundance has increased dramatically during the past decades. The increase in this typical mesopredator has restructured near-shore food webs, increased filamentous algal blooms, and threatens coastal biodiversity. Time-series data covering 22â years show that the increase coincides with a decline in the number of juvenile perch (perca fluviatilis), the most abundant predator of stickleback along the coast. We investigated the distribution of different stickleback plate armor phenotypes depending on latitude, environmental conditions, predator and prey abundances, nutrients, and benthic production; and described the stomach content of the stickleback phenotypes using metabarcoding. We found two distinct lateral armor plate phenotypes of stickleback, incompletely and completely plated. The proportion of incompletely plated individuals increased with increasing benthic production and decreasing abundances of adult perch. Metabarcoding showed that the stomach content of the completely plated individuals more often contained invertebrate herbivores (amphipods) than the incompletely plated ones. Since armor plates are defense structures favored by natural selection in the presence of fish predators, the phenotype distribution suggests that a novel low-predation regime favors stickleback with less armor. Our results suggest that morphological differentiation of the three-spined stickleback has the potential to affect food web dynamics and influence the persistence and resilience of the stickleback take-over in the baltic sea.

336,2021,"The effect of climate and human pressures on functional diversity and species richness patterns of amphibians, reptiles and mammals in europe","Diversity","The ongoing biodiversity crisis reinforces the urgent need to unravel diversity patterns and the underlying processes shaping them. Although taxonomic diversity has been extensively studied and is considered the common currency, simultaneously conserving other facets of diversity (e.g., functional diversity) is critical to ensure ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. Here, we explored the effect of key climatic factors (temperature, precipitation, temperature seasonality, and precipitation seasonality) and factors reflecting human pressures (agricultural land, urban land, land-cover diversity, and human population density) on the functional diversity. (Functional richness and raoâs quadratic entropy) and species richness of amphibians (68 species), reptiles (107 species), and mammals (176 species) in europe. We explored the relationship between different predictors and diversity metrics using generalized additive mixed model analysis, to capture non-linear relationships and to account for spatial autocorrelation. We found that at this broad continental spatial scale, climatic variables exerted a significant effect on the functional diversity and species richness of all taxa. On the other hand, variables reflecting human pressures contributed significantly in the models even though their explanatory power was lower compared to climatic variables. In most cases, functional richness and raoâs quadratic entropy responded similarly to climate and human pressures. In conclusion, climate is the most influential factor in shaping both the functional diversity and species richness patterns of amphibians, reptiles, and mammals in europe. However, incorporating factors reflecting human pressures complementary to climate could be conducive to us understanding the drivers of functional diversity and richness patterns.

338,2021,"Conserving galapagos landbirds in agricultural landscapes: forest patches of native trees needed to increase landbird diversity and abundance","Biodiversity And Conservation","One of the principal drivers of biodiversity loss is habitat loss due to land conversion for agriculture. Understanding how agricultural landscapes can be more biodiverse is critical in devising a working lands conservation plan. For at least 20â years, some bird populations in the galapagos have been in sharp decline, especially in the agricultural zone. Since 2010, we found that the relative abundance of ten out of eleven monitored landbird species has further decreased. We examined the existing habitat structures in the agricultural zone of santa cruz, historically established in former areas of native humid forest (scalesia), and analyzed which structures associated with higher landbird diversity and abundance of four declining species. We conducted standardized point counts and surveyed surrounding vegetation during the breeding period. Landbird diversity was highest in forest and coffee sites and least diverse in pasture sites. Main predictors of higher landbird diversity were forest patch presence, increased abundance of native vegetation and lower elevations. Main predictors of higher landbird relative abundance were percentage of forest in the surrounding 200â m radius buffer and forest patch presence. Our results suggest that to increase the contribution of farmlands to landbird conservation during the reproductive period, habitat management efforts should be targeted at increasing forest patches and/or corridors, particularly within pasture farms. Nevertheless, to ensure sustainability of these measures, economic value to the considered farmlands needs to be secured, social perspectives incorporated and other important threats to landbirds assessed.

Tcfs are threatened by direct human pressures and climate change, yet the fate of these extraordinary ecosystems remains insufficiently quantified. With discussions of the post-2020 biodiversity framework underway, tcfs are a defining test case of the success and promise of recent policy targets and their associated mechanisms to avert the global biodiversity crisis. Here we present a global assessment of the recent status and trends of tcfs and their biodiversity and evaluate the efficacy of current protection measures. We find that cloud forests occupied 0.4% of the global land surface in 2001 and harboured ~3,700 species of birds, mammal, amphibians and tree ferns (~15% of the global diversity of those groups), with half of those species entirely restricted to cloud forests. Worldwide, ~2.4% of cloud forests (in some regions, more than 8%) were lost between 2001 and 2018, especially in readily accessible places. While protected areas have slowed this decline, a large proportion of loss in tcf cover is still occurring despite formal protection. Increased conservation efforts are needed to avert the impending regional or global demise of tcfs and their unique biodiversity.

340,2021,"Excluding mammalian predators increases bird densities and seed dispersal in fenced ecosanctuaries","Ecology","Islands are epicenters of animal extinctions and population declines. These losses exacerbate biodiversity loss and disrupt ecological services in areas of high endemism. Island defaunation is primarily driven by invasive mammalian predators, and mammal eradications are reversing population declines for some island species. Invasive mammal eradications may also have the capacity to restore ecological interactions, along with the recovery of island fauna. Here we show that invasive mammal eradication in fenced ecosanctuaries results in higher rates of bird foraging on fruit, and higher bird-mediated seed dispersal, than in similar forests without mammal eradication. We further show that higher foraging and seed dispersal is related to higher densities of native bird species, after accounting for natural variation in fruit availability. For the many other systems globally that are under threat from invasive mammals, new zealandâs fenced ecosanctuary model offers a promising tool for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services.

341,2021,"Habitat selection of an endangered primate, the samango monkey (cercopithecus albogularis schwarzi): integrating scales to prioritize habitat for wildlife management","Ecology And Evolution","Aim: as habitat loss continues to accelerate with global human population growth, identifying landscape characteristics that influence species occurrence is a key conservation priority in order to prevent global biodiversity loss. In south africa, the arboreal samango monkey (cercopithecus albogularis sp.) Is threatened due to loss and fragmentation of the indigenous forests it inhabits. The aim of this study was to determine the habitat preferences of the samango monkey at different spatial scales, and to identify key conservation areas to inform management plans for this species. Location: this study was carried out in the western soutpansberg mountains, which represents the northernmost population of samango monkeys within south africa, and the only endangered subspecies (c.â a.â schwarzi). Methods: we used sequentially collected gps points from two samango monkey groups followed between 2012 and 2017 to quantify the used and available habitat for this species within the western soutpansberg mountains. We developed 2nd-order (selection of ranging area), 3rd-order (selection within range), and 4th-order (feeding site selection) resource selection functions (rsfs) to identify important habitat features at each scale. Through scale integration, we identified three key conservation areas for samango monkeys across limpopo province, south africa. Results: habitat productivity was the most important landscape variable predicting probability of use at each order of selection, indicating the dependence of these arboreal primates on tall-canopy indigenous forests. Critical habitat across limpopo was highly fragmented, meaning complete isolation between subpopulations is likely. Main conclusions: understanding the habitat characteristics that influence samango monkey distribution across south africa is crucial for prioritizing critical habitat for this species. Our results indicated that large, contiguous patches of tall-canopy indigenous forest are fundamental to samango monkey persistence. As such, protected area expansion of large forest patches and creation of forest corridors are identified as key conservation interventions for this species. Â© 2021 the authors.

As humans have destroyed much of their warm spring habitat, many manatees are forced to rely on power plant hot water effluent to survive during cold winter months. Visitorsâ reactions to the mvc are every bit as incongruous as a massive greenhouse gas pollutant source enabling a wildlife reserve. Notwithstanding its inescapable presence, visitor reviews of the mvc nearly uniformly ignore the immense power plant. We offer this study of online reviews of the mvc to examine how and why everyday people's interactions are fundamental to making dominant practices of anthropogenic ecological destruction unremarkable and, therefore, unfixable. Specifically, we argue the collective blindness reflected in the findings of this study exemplifies a broader sociocultural tendency to articulate and reinforce spaces of ecological âinvisibility.â in such spaces, our quotidian practices and discourses play a central role in enabling collective environmental inattention and environmental inaction, especially when we are confronted with places in which the constructed binary between human and ânaturalâ realms spectacularly collapses.

343,2021,"Behavioural and demographic changes in impala populations after 15 years of improved conservation management","Global Ecology And Conservation","Many protected areas (pas) have been created globally in response to the dramatic human-induced decline in biodiversity. However, not all pas successfully preserve their biodiversity and continued monitoring is vital to assess the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Here, we repeated a study done in 2003 to assess whether investments in anti-poaching in two partially pas (ppas), grumeti game reserve (ggr) and ikona wildlife management area (iwma), have had quantifiable impacts on impala (aepyceros melampus) populations, compared to the adjacent strictly protected serengeti national park. Since 2003, management of the ppas has changed dramatically under the non-profit organisation grumeti fund. We predicted that if conservation management had improved, impala populations in 2018 would have higher local density, less female-skewed sex ratio, larger group sizes, and shorter flight initiation distances (fid). To assess these parameters of the impala populations, we conducted the same road-based surveys in 2003 and 2018. We found that compared to 2003, impala population density doubled in ggr, group sizes were larger in iwma and nearly doubled in ggr, and that impala had shorter fid in iwma in 2018. Our results suggest that the changes in conservation management could have led to the observed positive impacts for impala populations. Our study is encouraging for managers and reveals a conservation success story: if proper action is taken to increase the protection of wildlife within ppas, wildlife populations may respond quickly and positively.

Its delivery would be facilitated by making the actions required to halt and reverse species loss spatially explicit. Here, we develop a species threat abatement and restoration (star) metric that is scalable across species, threats and geographies. Star quantifies the contributions that abating threats and restoring habitats in specific places offer towards reducing extinction risk. While every nation can contribute towards halting biodiversity loss, indonesia, colombia, mexico, madagascar and brazil combined have stewardship over 31% of total star values for terrestrial amphibians, birds and mammals. Among actions, sustainable crop production and forestry dominate, contributing 41% of total star values for these taxonomic groups. Key biodiversity areas cover 9% of the terrestrial surface but capture 47% of star values. Star could support governmental and non-state actors in quantifying their contributions to meeting science-based species targets within the framework.

345,2021,"The insular herpetofauna of mexico: composition, conservation, and biogeographic patterns","Ecology And Evolution","We compile a mexican insular herpetofaunal checklist to estimate endemism, conservation status, island threats, net taxonomic turnover among six biogeographic provinces belonging to the nearctic and neotropical regions, and the relationships between island area and mainland distance versus species richness. We compile a checklist of insular herpetofaunal through performing a literature and collection review. We define the conservation status according to conservation mexican law, the red list of international union for conservation of nature, and environmental vulnerability scores. We determine threat percentages on islands according to the 11 major classes of threats to biodiversity. We estimate the net taxonomic turnover with beta diversity analysis between the nearctic and neotropical provinces. The mexican insular herpetofauna is composed of 18 amphibian species, 204 species with 101 subspecies of reptiles, and 263 taxa in total. Endemism levels are 11.76% in amphibians, 53.57% in reptiles, and 27.91% being insular endemic taxa. Two conservation status systems classify the species at high extinction risk, while the remaining system suggests less concern. However, all systems indicate species lacking assessment. Human activities and exotic alien species are present on 60% of 131 islands. The taxonomic turnover value is high (0.89), with a clear herpetofaunal differentiation between the two biogeographic regions. The speciesâarea and speciesâmainland distance relationships are positive. Insular herpetofauna faces a high percentage of threats, with the neotropical provinces more heavily impacted. It is urgent to explore the remaining islands (3,079 islands) and better incorporate insular populations and species in ecological, evolutionary, and systematic studies. In the face of the biodiversity crisis, islands will play a leading role as a model to apply restoration and conservation strategies. Â© 2021 the authors.

346,2021,"Conservation interventions to reduce vessel strikes on sea turtles: a case study in florida","Marine Policy","Sea turtles and boating activities often occur in shared waters. This is problematic because sea turtles are susceptible to vessel strikes since they spend significant portions of their lives in nearshore shallow water to breathe, reproduce, and feed. Targeted conservation strategies are needed to reduce vessel strikes on sea turtles, and successful integration of stakeholder perspectives is necessary for conservation success. Here, we present results from a multi-step approach to investigate responses to potential conservation interventions for reducing vessel strikes on sea turtles. First, challenges and opportunities related to potential interventions that could be used to reduce sea turtle vessel strikes were discussed and assessed by a workshop of conservation and enforcement experts. Second, the workshop-identified interventions were incorporated into a survey questionnaire for recreational boaters. Third, this face-to-face survey was administered around the st. Lucie inlet, an area identified as a vessel strike âhot spotâ in florida (usa). The questionnaire asked about boating preferences and practices, existing and potential conservation interventions, and sea turtle presence in the area. Respondents suggested that greater community support for implementation of interventions would be obtained if they (1) were voluntary rather than mandatory/legislated, (2) overlapped with existing interventions (e.g., if speed mitigation zones for sea turtles overlapped significantly with existing speed reduction zones for manatees) and/or added minimal new restrictions and inconveniences, and (3) were accompanied by explanatory materials on the need for, and the effectiveness of, such management strategies. Boater buy-in for management strategies and compliance can vary significantly. As such, our exploratory study should be replicated where proposed sea turtle conservation-related strategies might be warranted to ensure proper contextual fit. Boaters are a powerful, integral, and a growing demographic that must be effectively and respectfully engaged for effective sea turtle conservation in florida and beyond.

347,2021,"Determinants of population persistence and abundance of terrestrial and arboreal vertebrates stranded in tropical forest land-bridge islands","Conservation Biology","Megadams are among the key modern drivers of habitat and biodiversity loss in emerging economies. The balbina hydroelectric dam of central brazilian amazonia inundated 312,900 ha of primary forests and created approximately 3500 variable-sized islands that still harbor vertebrate populations after nearly 3 decades after isolation. We estimated the species richness, abundance, biomass, composition, and group size of medium- to large-bodied forest vertebrates in response to patch, landscape, and habitat-quality metrics across 37 islands and 3 continuous forest sites throughout the balbina archipelago. We conducted 1168 km of diurnal censuses and had 12,420 camera-trapping days along 81 transects with 207 camera stations. We determined the number of individuals (or groups) detected per 10 km walked and the number of independent photographs per 10 camera-trapping days, respectively, for each species. We recorded 34 species, and patch area was the most significant predictor of vertebrate population relative abundance and aggregate biomass. The maximum group size of several group-living species was consistently larger on large islands and in continuous patches than on small islands. Most vertebrate populations were extirpated after inundation. Remaining populations are unlikely to survive further ecological disruptions. If all vertebrate species were once widely distributed before inundation, we estimated that approximately 75% of all individual vertebrates were lost from all 3546 islands and 7.4% of the animals in all persisting insular populations are highly likely to be extirpated. Our results demonstrate that population abundance estimates should be factored into predictions of community disassembly on small islands to robustly predict biodiversity outcomes. Given the rapidly escalating hydropower infrastructure projects in developing counties, we suggest that faunal abundance and biomass estimates be considered in environmental impact assessments and large strictly protected reserves be established to minimize detrimental effects of dams on biodiversity. Conserving large tracts of continuous forests represents the most critical conservation measure to ensure that animal populations can persist at natural densities in amazonian forests.

348,2021,"Unforeseen consequences of conservation management practices: case study on herding rhino as an anti-poaching measure","Animal Conservation","The current biodiversity crisis calls for effective conservation measures. However, some measures may have unforeseen negative consequences on individual species. Herding, a management practice currently used in some wildlife species to protect animals from poachers, can cause habituation to humans, which unintentionally might increase their risk of being poached at a later time. Herding could also negatively impact animal welfare and physiology when perceived as a stressor, with potential negative consequences at the individual and population level. In this study, we tested the following hypotheses: 1) herding elicits habituation to humans in white rhino, and 2) this practice affects the behavior and physiological state of rhino, but they can habituate to it. To that aim, we investigated the effects of herding on the response of rhino to initially unfamiliar people, expression of aggressive and discomfort behaviors, and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fgcm) concentrations (a commonly used indicator of physiological stress) in two cohorts of six and 10 semi-wild orphan white rhino. Rhino did not interrupt their activity to an approaching person on foot (99%) or in a vehicle (94%), indicating habituation to humans. Aggressive and discomfort behaviors were displayed more often while being herded, and their frequency increased significantly with increasing herding pressure. Finally, overall mean fgcm concentrations were 16.1% higher under herding compared to non-herding conditions, but individual fgcm levels varied up to 17-fold under each scenario, suggesting that herding might not elicit a physiological stress response in these animals. While rhino security is paramount in the current poaching crisis, management practices must ensure that they do not impact negatively at the individual and population level.

The long-term effects of ocp ban for agricultural use in china since 1983 on the reproductive health of small terrestrial mammals have never been evaluated in the field. We examined the residue dynamics of ocps and the reproductive performance of chinese striped hamsters (cricetulus barabensis) in north china plain during 1983-2010 and concluded that the exposure levels of ocps in hamsters drastically decreased from 2900 â± 740 to 25.2 â± 6.88 ng/g with an average half-life of 5.08 yrs, coinciding with the observed reproductive recovery of hamsters. The population-based reproductive performance of hamsters was significantly and negatively associated with ocp exposure levels after adjusting the contributions from climate and population density factors, indicating that the ban of ocps has facilitated the reproductive recovery of hamsters by up to 81% contribution. Our findings suggest that the ocp ban is effective to restore reproduction of small terrestrial mammals. Integration of population biology and environmental science is essential to assess the impacts of persistent organic pollutants on ecological safety and biodiversity loss under accelerated global change.

Here, we analyze the impact of declining biodiversity on nutrients supplied by fish using detailed information from the peruvian amazon, where inland fisheries provide a critical source of nutrition for many of the region's 800,000 people. We found that the impacts of biodiversity loss on nutrient supplies depended on compensation, trophic dynamics, and functional diversity. When small sedentary species compensated for declines in large migratory species, fatty acid supplies increased, while zinc and iron supplies decreased. In contrast, the probability of failing to maintain supplies or nutrient supply risk increased when species were nutritionally unique. Our results show that trait-based regulations and public health polices need to consider biodiversity's vital role in sustaining nutritional benefits for over 2 billion people dependent on wild foods across the globe.

Unfortunately, with increasing cases of failure, the link between poverty alleviation and conservation is now controversial. We revisited the earliest icdp project in china after 12 years. The project area experienced increasing free-ranging livestock after 2004, which degraded the panda habitat. We collected livestock and socio-economic data using constructed household surveys and applied logit and zero-truncated poisson models to understand the effect of icdp. About 76% of livestock activities were in the panda habitat. Receipt of icdp funds increased the chance of a household to become a livestock owner. The participation in icdp also increased the numbers of both the traditional livestock â cattle by 83% â as well as the emerging type horses by 203%. Horses were encouraged for tourism and later raised for meat production. The income from alternative livelihoods such as tourism and off-farm jobs reduced the reliance on cattle but encouraged having more horses. Our results show that with the ban on logging and reduced cropland, assistance from icdp facilitated the participants to accumulate wealth much quicker than others and to increase their livestock holdings. The immediate success in reducing reliance on certain natural resources and the community development of the short-duration projects could fail the long-term goals of conserving the endangered species habitat. Future conservation projects should either establish long-term mechanisms such as conditionality for incentives or create self-interests in conservation among the communities to cope with unexpected threats in the future.

354,2021,"Evaluating created wetlands for bird diversity and reproductive success","Biological Conservation","Wetland creation is a common conservation practice to mitigate biodiversity loss, caused by global wetland destruction. Despite this, there is a lack of large-scale evaluations of how created wetland characteristics and landscape context relate to bird diversity and reproductive success. We inventoried 89 created wetlands (0.2â20 ha) in central sweden to investigate which local and landscape components were associated with breeding wetland bird species richness, pair abundance and reproductive success. Wetland size was positively associated with species richness, pair abundance and chick abundance. However, several small (1 ha) wetlands taken together were similar to or exceeded individual large wetlands of similar total wetland area, in terms of species richness, pair abundance, and chicks produced. While species richness showed a clear negative relationship with the proportion of the adjacent 50 m buffer composed of forest, pair abundance was positively related to the proportion of flooded grassland area and negatively related to the proportion of emergent water vegetation. Reproductive success measures showed no clear relationships to local habitat characteristics but tended to increase with a decreasing forest at the landscape scale. Our results suggest that breeding wetland bird populations could benefit from creating wetlands with a high flooded area, continuous management to minimise both the area of emergent water vegetation and the establishment of shrubs and trees in the immediate surroundings. We also suggest a practice of creating mainly small wetlands with a few larger ones to facilitate breeding wetland bird communities at the regional scale (gamma diversity).

355,2021,"The âgoldilocks zoneâ of predation: the level of fox control needed to select predator resistance in a reintroduced mammal in australia","Biodiversity And Conservation","A large component of the anthropogenic biodiversity crisis is the loss of animal species. In response, there has been significant investment in reintroductions of species to their historical ranges. Predation by native and exotic predators, however, remains a barrier to success. Over the past 200â years, australia has seen the highest rate of mammal extinction on earth, with mammals within a critical weight range (cwr: 35â gâ5.5â kg) most affected due to predation by exotic predators. Populations of some threatened species now exist only in tasmania, offshore islands, or predator-proof sanctuaries. The next critical step is to return native populations outside of predator-free areas, âbeyond-the-fenceâ, on the continental mainland. Given our current inability to completely remove exotic predators from mainland ecosystems, how can we achieve successful mammal reintroductions? A potential solution is to drive adaptation of reintroduced animals towards predator-resistance by exposing them to low levels of predation. We propose the concept of a âgoldilocks zoneââthe âjust rightâ levels of predation needed to drive selection for predator-resistant native species, while ensuring population viability. We experimentally reintroduced a mammal, the eastern bettong (bettongia gaimardi), to mainland australia, 100â years after its local extinction. Using an intense baiting regime, we reduced the population density of the red fox (vulpes vulpes), the main factor behind the eastern bettongâs extirpation from the continent. Reducing bait take to 15% of previous levels allowed differential survival among bettongs; some surviving under 100â days and others over 450 (~ 4 times longer than some similar trials with related species). Surviving individuals were generally larger at release than those that died earlier, implying selection for larger bettongs. Our results suggest that reducing predation could establish a goldilocks zone that could drive selection for bettongs with predator-resistant traits. Our work contributes to a growing body of literature that explores a shift towards harnessing evolutionary principles to combat the challenges posed by animal management and conservation.

356,2021,"Testing the habitat amount hypothesis and fragmentation effects for medium- and large-sized mammals in a biodiversity hotspot","Landscape Ecology","Context: habitat loss is widely recognized as the main driver of biodiversity loss around the globe, yet the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity have been extensively debated in recent years. Objectives: we used a robust dataset of medium and large-sized mammals to test (a) the habitat amount hypothesis, which postulates that species richness can be mainly predicted by the total amount of habitat surrounding the sampling site, and (b) the effects of habitat fragmentation per se, which may be expected to be weak or mainly positive on species richness. Methods: we compiled information on the occurrence of mammal species in 166 forest fragments across the atlantic forest. For each forest fragment, we extracted information on patch size, percentage of forest cover (a proxy for habitat amount), and edge density and number of fragments (fragmentation metrics). We related these metrics to mammalian richness considering separately for all species, forest-dependent species, disturbance-tolerant species, and different trophic guilds. Results: all richness measures strongly declined with decreasing forest cover, yet were unaffected by patch size, number of patches and edge density. The only exception occurred with herbivore richness, which was affected by number of patches. However, we found fragmentation per se effects only for herbivore richness. Conclusions: our results show that mammal richness increased with habitat amount at the landscape, whereas habitat fragmentation per se had significant negative impacts on herbivores only. We therefore recommend maintaining highly forested landscapes and restoring severely deforested areas, being essential for ensuring high richness of mammals.

357,2021,"Functional diversity and trait filtering of insectivorous bats relate to forest biogeography and fragmentation in south africa","Journal Of Biogeography","Aim: forest fragmentation is a major driver of biodiversity loss causing declines in species richness and functional diversity of biotic communities. Bats are essential components of ecosystems and are useful bio-indicators of habitat disturbance, yet the response and vulnerability of bats to fragmentation have been poorly studied in africa. We aim to assess the effects of forest biogeographical history and fragmentation on functional diversity of bats and their functional traits. Location: eastern cape and southern kwazulu-natal, south africa. Taxon: insectivorous bats. Methods: we surveyed forest-utilizing bats to derive four functional diversity indices. Generalized linear models were used to assess the response of diversity indices to biogeographical history and fragmentation, represented by forest type and five landscape fragmentation metrics. Rlq and fourth-corner analysis were used to investigate the interaction of traits with fragmentation metrics and forest type. Results: pondoland scarp forests displayed high functional richness, while eastern cape dune forests exhibited high functional divergence yet low functional richness and dispersion. Two fragmentation metrics affected functional diversity dynamically: edge density had a positive effect on functional evenness; and dispersion was negatively affected by river length through forests. Results showed stronger interactions of functional traits with forest type than fragmentation metrics, with filtering effects on body size and wing morphology. Main conclusions: the large-scale processes related to biogeographical history, and associated forest structure, are important determinants of functional richness, divergence and dispersion of insectivorous bat communities. Scarp forests showed the highest species and functional richness as they experienced less extreme climatic extinction filtering than mistbelt forests during the last glacial maximum, whereas the low diversity of eastern cape dune forests results from their younger evolutionary history and homogenous vegetation structure. Little is known of the sensitivity of bats to habitat fragmentation in africa: here, we show larger-sized insectivorous species; and species exhibiting low wing loading may be more vulnerable to fragmentation.

358,2021,"Differential responses of anuran assemblages to land use in agroecosystems of central argentina","Agriculture, Ecosystems And Environment","Agriculture has been identified as one of the largest contributors to the current global biodiversity crisis. Amphibians are declining worldwide, and the loss of habitat and water contamination related to agricultural land uses have been suggested as the main drivers of this phenomenon. In central argentina, the pampean region combines the highest rates of grassland replacement of south america, the lowest percentage of protected areas of the country, and the lack of studies exploring diversity patterns of native amphibians occurring in agroecosystems. To fill these gaps, we surveyed anuran (frogs and toads) assemblages from 342 breeding ponds located in three ecological units from central argentina (rolling, flooding, and inland pampas) during three breeding seasons (2015â2018). We aimed to evaluate the importance of breeding habitat characteristics (ponds) and the surrounding landscape features as drivers of anuran diversity occurring in agricultural landscapes under the primary land uses of the region (cattle grazing and soybean cropping). We tested for the effects of breeding habitat characteristics and landscape features on anuran richness, abundance, and individual species occurrence, using glmm models and information-theoretic procedures. Results indicated that species richness and total abundances were differently influenced by the habitat and landscape features across the ecological units. Overall, vegetation cover of the ponds and land use were the most important variables influencing richness and anuran abundance. The positive influence of pond vegetation cover on anuran assemblages was registered for all the ecological units, while different patterns emerged when we analyzed the effects of land use surrounding the ponds. Land use expressed as the percentage of soy crop surrounding the ponds negatively affected richness and abundance of anurans of the flooding pampas, but the inverse relation was found for assemblages occurring in the inland pampas. Moreover, multiple competing models suggested a positive correlation between anuran diversity and land-use heterogeneity, and pond density. The differential responses of anuran assemblages among the ecological units can be related to a combination of several factors encompassing regional soil characteristics (i.e., soil texture), land-use intensity as well as requirements of anuran species. We discussed the particularities of each ecological unit in order to recognize those conservation efforts that will favor anuran diversity in these altered landscapes and further contribute to achieving agricultural sustainability.

359,2021,"Economic assessment of rewilding versus agri-environmental nature management","Ambio","Policies aiming at improving biodiversity often consist of costly agri-environmental schemes, i.e. Subsidized grazing or mowing of semi-natural areas. However, these practices have widely been found to be insufficient to mitigate biodiversity loss. Rewilding, i.e. Restoring natural processes in self-sustaining biodiverse ecosystems, has been proposed as an alternative and is hypothesized to be a more cost-efficient approach to promote biodiversity conservation. Rewilding requires the availability of large natural areas which are not allocated for farming, forestry, and infrastructure to avoid potential conflicts over the use of the area. We perform an ex-ante private costâbenefit analysis of the establishment of four large nature reserves for rewilding in denmark. We analyse the economic effects of changing from summer grazing in nature areas in combination with cultivated fields and forestry to the establishment of nature reserves in four case areas. We consider two scenarios involving conversion of agriculture and forestry areas into natural areas in combination with either extensive year-round cattle grazing or rewilding with wild large herbivores. In two case areas, it appears possible to establish large nature areas without incurring extra costs. Additionally, rewilding further reduces costs compared to year-round cattle grazing. Two opposing effects were dominant: increased economic rent occurred from the shift from summer grazing to year-round grazing or rewilding, while cessation of agriculture and forestry caused opportunity costs.

360,2021,"Assessing the extinction probability of the purple-winged ground dove, an enigmatic bamboo specialist","Frontiers In Ecology And Evolution","The continued loss, fragmentation, and degradation of forest habitats are driving an extinction crisis for tropical and subtropical bird species. This loss is particularly acute in the atlantic forest of south america, where it is unclear whether several endemic bird species are extinct or extant. We collate and model spatiotemporal distributional data for one such âlostâ species, the purple-winged ground dove paraclaravis geoffroyi, a critically endangered endemic of the atlantic forest biome, which is nomadic and apparently dependent on masting bamboo stands. We compared its patterns of occurrence with that of a rare âcontrolâ forest pigeon, the violaceous quail-dove geotrygon violacea, which occurs in regional sympatry. We also solicit information from aviculturists who formerly kept the species. We find that the two species share a similar historical recording rate but can find no documentary evidence (i.e., specimens, photos, video, sound recordings) for the persistence of purple-winged ground dove in the wild after the 1980s, despite periodic sighting records, and after which time citizen scientists frequently documented the control species in the wild. Assessments of the probability that the species is extant are sensitive to the method of analysis, and whether records lacking documentary evidence are considered credible. Analysis of the temporal sequence of past records reveals the extent of the historical range contraction of the purple-winged ground dove, while our species distribution model highlights the geographic search priorities for field ornithologists hoping to rediscover the speciesâaided by the first recording of the species vocalizations which we obtained from interviews with aviculturists. Our interviews also revealed that the species persisted in captivity from the 1970s until the 1990s (up to 150 birds), until a law was passed obstructing captive breeding efforts by private individuals, putting an end to perhaps the best chance we had to save the species from extinction.

This conservation paradox may also apply in protected areas but has not yet received conclusive evidence in marine ecosystems. Here, we survey fish assemblages in six mediterranean no-take reserves and their adjacent fishing grounds using environmental dna (edna) while controlling for environmental conditions. We detect less fish species in marine reserves than in nearby fished areas. The paradoxical gradient in species richness is accompanied by a marked change in fish species composition under different managements. This dissimilarity is mainly driven by species that are often overlooked by classical visual surveys but detected with edna: cryptobenthic, pelagic, and rare fishes. These results do not negate the importance of reserves in protecting biodiversity but shed new light on how under-represented species groups can positively react to fishing pressure and how conservation efforts can shape regional biodiversity patterns.

362,2021,"Investigating the risks of removing wild meat from global food systems","Current Biology","The covid-19 pandemic has brought humanity's strained relationship with nature into sharp focus, with calls for cessation of wild meat trade and consumption, to protect public health and biodiversity.1,2 however, the importance of wild meat for human nutrition, and its tele-couplings to other food production systems, mean that the complete removal of wild meat from diets and markets would represent a shock to global food systems.3â6 the negative consequences of this shock deserve consideration in policy responses to covid-19. We demonstrate that the sudden policy-induced loss of wild meat from food systems could have negative consequences for people and nature. Loss of wild meat from diets could lead to food insecurity, due to reduced protein and nutrition, and/or drive land-use change to replace lost nutrients with animal agriculture, which could increase biodiversity loss and emerging infectious disease risk. We estimate the magnitude of these consequences for 83 countries, and qualitatively explore how prohibitions might play out in 10 case study places. Results indicate that risks are greatest for food-insecure developing nations, where feasible, sustainable, and socially desirable wild meat alternatives are limited. Some developed nations would also face shocks, and while high-capacity food systems could more easily adapt, certain places and people would be disproportionately impacted. We urge decision-makers to consider potential unintended consequences of policy-induced shocks amidst covid-19; and take holistic approach to wildlife trade interventions, which acknowledge the interconnectivity of global food systems and nature, and include safeguards for vulnerable people.

363,2021,"Primordial germ cells isolated from individual embryos of red junglefowl and indigenous pheasants of thailand","Theriogenology","Interspecific germline chimerism mediated by transplantation of primordial germ cells (pgcs) of wild species to domestic hosts promises the conservation of wild birds. Cryopreservation of avian eggs and embryos is impracticable, and currently only frozen pgcs enable conservation of both the male and female descendants. Purebred offspring have been obtained from germline chimeras of wild avian species, proving the feasibility of such technology. In vitro propagation has been optimized for avian pgcs of domestic species; however, evidence is rather limited for successful isolation as well as long-term culture from a single embryo of wild species. With accelerating biodiversity loss, we have committed to preserving current genetic resources by freezing pgcs isolated from individual embryos in addition to their genetic material. We have devised a reliable protocol for the isolation and proliferation of pgcs from wild fowls in the family phasianidae that are conserved in captive breeding (red junglefowl, bar-tailed pheasant, kalij pheasant, siamese fireback pheasant, and silver pheasant). We obtained individual isolates of cultured circulating pgcs (49.7%, 79/155) as well as tissue pgcs (92.9%, 144/155). The specific co-culture conditions of autologous embryonic cells, without additional growth factors, facilitated the proliferation of so-called tissue pgcs (the remaining pgcs in embryonic tissue following blood aspiration). Only circulating pgcs left in blood vessels and of pgcs migrating to developing gonads have been previously reported. However, the present study is the first to report on the harvest of ectopic pgcs. The defined conditions sustained continuous proliferation of tissue pgcs for at least six months and maintained pgc identity following cryopreservation. Cultured tissue pgcs of these wild species were extensively characterized for their expression of the germ cell-specific proteins, chicken vasa homolog (cvh) and deleted in azoospermia-like (dazl), as well as the ability to colonize chicken embryonic gonads. The novel protocol is practical for generating enough pgcs for cryopreservation, transplantation, and additionally, it enables isolation of pgcs from both blood circulation and embryonic tissue simultaneously. For conservation purposes, this approach is potentially applicable more widely to other non-domestic birds than those in the family phasianidae that were investigated in the present study.

364,2021,"Estimating the impacts of habitat loss induced by urbanization on bird local extinctions","Biological Conservation","Habitat loss and fragmentation can be long-term processes driving extinction debts, especially in cities. Because of a lack of temporal data, long-term impacts are generally investigated less frequently than short-term impacts. However, these effects are equally important for understanding biodiversity loss. We developed a bayesian island biogeography model combining historical imagery and current species distribution to investigate the long-term impacts of urbanization-induced habitat loss and isolation on birds. We surveyed 101 bird species in 43 urban forest patches in a south american city with different combinations of size, isolation, and time since the last abrupt change in area. Based on the current and historical landscape configuration, we estimated the temporal dynamics between species extinction rate and area, and between immigration rate and isolation. Additionally, we used model parameters to forecast bird extinction debts. Large patches had lower extinction rates than small patches, and immigration rates were lower in more isolated patches. Furthermore, current bird species richness was better explained by current landscape configuration than by past configuration, suggesting that birds rapidly respond to changes in urban landscapes and there are no apparent extinction debts. Indeed, we found that habitat loss reduces species diversity to a new equilibrium in relatively short period (less than 10 years), and model projections indicate that bird richness will remain similar to the present if patch area is maintained. Habitat loss is the most important cause of species local extinctions in urban areas, and tropical cities could rapidly promote biodiversity by restoring forest cover.

Vertebrate extinction is at an all-time high, and losses of reptiles are no exception. The turtles are a unique vertebrate group of grave conservation concern. I compared recent declines in turtle biodiversity to the losses of testudinata (cryptodira + pleurodira) and non-dinosaurian reptiles during the most recent mass extinction. Fuzzy arithmetic was used because of its suitability to deal with uncertainty in these kinds of data sets and the questions that arise with comparing geological data with those from recent times. This revealed that extinctions of turtles in modern times massively exceed losses observed at the cretaceousâpaleogene border. Further, if turtle extinctions continued at their current level, massive losses of these charismatic animals could occur within our lifetime and loss of the entire group could occur in just a few centuries.

Robust long-term time-series data to detect such population declines are key to understanding how species respond to climatic variations. Thus, we assessed the species' richness and abundance of an anuran assemblage in the atlantic forest in brazil, where average temperatures were rising over the last 30 years. A series of models were applied to a long time-series of amphibian standardized monitoring (2010â2019) to assess the impact of a combination of a series of local climatic factors, and species life-history traits, to detect any variation on species abundance and richness. We observed a significant reduction in species abundance and a trend of reduction in species richness over time. Temperature had a stronger influence on species abundance and richness compared to precipitation. Furthermore, the most resilient species were generalist and peri-anthropic ones. Although more robust data is needed to pinpoint climate change-related variation on species decline, anticipating amphibian sensitivity to climate shift, and the limited time to act, our results are concerning. We suggest further studies to evaluate other aspects that could be influencing this local population decline and highlights that a broader amphibian monitoring program should be implemented in the atlantic forest to detect other equally silent gradual declines.

367,2021,"Climate and habitat configuration limit range expansion and patterns of dispersal in a non-native lizard","Ecology And Evolution","Invasive species are one of the main causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. As introduced, populations increase in abundance and geographical range, so does the potential for negative impacts on native communities. As such, there is a need to better understand the processes driving range expansion as species become established in recipient landscapes. Through an investigation into capacity for population growth and range expansion of introduced populations of a non-native lizard (podarcis muralis), we aimed to demonstrate how multi-scale factors influence spatial spread, population growth, and invasion potential in introduced species. We collated location records of p.â muralis presence in england, uk through data collected from field surveys and a citizen science campaign. We used these data as input for presence-background models to predict areas of climate suitability at a national-scale (5â km resolution), and fine-scale habitat suitability at the local scale (2â m resolution). We then integrated local models into an individual-based modeling platform to simulate population dynamics and forecast range expansion for 10 populations in heterogeneous landscapes. National-scale models indicated climate suitability has restricted the species to the southern parts of the uk, primarily by a latitudinal cline in overwintering conditions. Patterns of population growth and range expansion were related to differences in local landscape configuration and heterogeneity. Growth curves suggest populations could be in the early stages of exponential growth. However, annual rates of range expansion are predicted to be low (5â16â m). We conclude that extensive nationwide range expansion through secondary introduction is likely to be restricted by currently unsuitable climate beyond southern regions of the uk. However, exponential growth of local populations in habitats providing transport pathways is likely to increase opportunities for regional expansion. The broad habitat niche of p.â muralis, coupled with configuration of habitat patches in the landscape, allows populations to increase locally with minimal dispersal. Â© 2021 the authors.

369,2021,"A non-native woody plant compromises conservation benefits of mid-field woodlots for birds in farmland","Global Ecology And Conservation","Agricultural intensification seriously threatens european biodiversity. To mitigate this threat, farmland habitat suitability should be improved. Mid-field woodlots surrounded by intensively cultivated fields or grasslands, represent one of the promising tools for such improvement. However, woodlots can be dominated by non-native plants and their impacts on woodlot function as refugees for biodiversity remains unclear. Therefore, we studied the impact of the invasive black locust (robinia pseudoacacia l.) On bird species richness in woodlots in intensively cultivated central european farmland. We surveyed 27 mid-field woodlots (13 covered by native vegetation and 14 dominated by black locust) in the czech republic, relating the species richness of all birds, habitat specialists and habitat generalists to woodlot characteristics: black locust occurrence, distance to the main forest, age of the woodlot, vegetation structure, arthropod biomass (representing food supply for birds), surrounding habitats and type of crops in which they are embedded. Our results suggest that the woodlots covered by the black locust had lower species richness of all birds, habitat specialists and habitat generalists than the woodlots covered by native tree species. The negative impact of the invasive woody plant on birds was likely driven by changes in vegetation structure since such woodlots had lower coverage of the shrub layer and less continuous canopy. This mechanism was particularly supported in habitat generalists, whereas habitat specialists additionally showed positive relationships to the other vegetation characteristics (namely the coverage of herbs in the ground layer and the proportion of medium-sized trees). Our study shows that even though mid-field woodlots host numerous bird species, their role in the delivery of conservation benefits for breeding birds is compromised if non-native woody plants dominate the vegetation. Therefore, from the perspective of breeding birdsâ conservation, the native woody plant species should be used for woodlot establishment.

370,2021,"Size-selective exclusion of mammals and invertebrates differently affects grassland plant communities depending on vegetation type","Journal Of Ecology","Human-caused loss of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, defaunation, is increasing, and potentially affects plant community structure of diverse grassland ecosystems world-wide. We experimentally simulated defaunation using size-selective fences to progressively exclude large-, medium- and small-sized mammals, and invertebrates from two subalpine vegetation types in the swiss national park (snp): intensively grazed short-grass and moderately grazed tall-grass vegetation. We assessed plant community properties yearly from 2009 to 2013, and examined treatment effects on plant community structure in the two grassland types. In the short-grass vegetation, the exclusion of large mammals increased total plant biomass, while the exclusion of large and medium-sized mammals increased total, grass and forb biomass compared to when all animals had access. These increases became stronger when invertebrates were also excluded. The exclusion of all mammals and invertebrates increased biomass of grasses by 205%, forbs by 100% and total plant biomass by 118% compared to when all animals had access, hence enhancing relative biomass of grasses from 43.6% to 60%, changing plant species composition and lowering richness of forbs by 16%, the number of plant families by 13% and family-level shannon diversity by 23%. In contrast to these significant community-level responses found in the short-grass vegetation, there was no evidence that the size-selective exclusion of animals altered the plant community structure of the tall-grass vegetation. The contrasting results were due to the difference in plant community composition prior to our experiment, which were related to differences in quantity and quality of forage and in grazing intensities of herbivores between the two grassland types. Synthesis. Our results showed that different-sized animals, in particular large mammals and invertebrates, contributed to maintain the plant community structure in the short-grass vegetation, highlighting the importance of multiple, functionally different animal groups for ecosystem functioning and stability. In contrast to the short-grass vegetation, we could not detect such a top-down control by animals in the tall-grass vegetation. Our results suggest that potential defaunation effects on grassland plant community structure depend on the degree of grazing pressure release and grassland vegetation type.

Here, we examined how loss of river-lake connectivity affected multifaceted (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic) alpha and beta diversity of fish assemblages in 11 yangtze river floodplain lakes over the past 70 years. We found that all three facets of alpha diversity significantly decreased through time, but the decrease rate was highest (31.4%) in taxonomic richness, second in functional (26.4%) and lowest in phylogenetic facet (4.7%). Nevertheless, taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic structures of fish fauna all exhibited differentiation. The taxonomic and phylogenetic differentiations were due to the joint increases in their turnover and nestedness-resultant component, whereas the functional differentiation was mainly driven by the increase in its turnover component. Such distinct results were because of the imbalanced extirpations of fish species (especially from species-poor orders and families) in disconnected lakes and connected lakes. With few exceptions of strong correlations between changes in taxonomic dissimilarities and phylogenetic dissimilarities, we generally found weak correlations between changes in different facets of both alpha and beta diversity. This discrepancy highlights that measuring different biodiversity facets offer distinct information about biodiversity dynamics and can enhance our ability to detect and evaluate the impacts of floodplain disconnection on biodiversity. We therefore recommend an integrative approach embracing taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity is essential to effective biodiversity assessment and conservation in large river floodplains.

Consequently, many meadow birds have drastically declined, and the habitats they select for breeding currently rely on land management. However, the selection of habitats maintained by agriculture may contribute to reduced fitness and thus remain maladaptive for individuals, which makes conservation challenging. An understanding of the relationships between speciesâ habitat selection, food supply and land management in the context of speciesâ behaviour is therefore crucial for conservation. Lowland populations of great snipe gallinago media are currently declining at a moderate rate, causing a conservation concern. We examined the daytime site selection (assumed as foraging sites) and food supply of radiotracked great snipe males breeding on a floodplain in ne poland. Foraging sites were classified at micro- and macro-scale levels using the logistic regression in a useâavailability design. On the micro-scale level, males selected moderate sward height and density, and a large amount of bare ground patches, and the importance of these increased as the breeding season progressed. On the macro-scale level, these conditions were associated with (1) meadows mown twice per season and grazed thereafter (associated with the most abundant food resources â earthworms) and (2) extensively managed pastures, suggesting the importance of grazing. Abandoned or late-mown meadows under agri-environmental schemes (aes) were avoided by foraging males. However, parcels with delayed mowing offer safe breeding sites for females nesting close to leks, unlike land-use types preferred by foraging males, which may act as an ecological trap. Effective conservation of great snipes on floodplain meadows requires precisely targeted aes schemes that will provide a mosaic of intensive and extensive land-use patches in the vicinity of identified leks.

374,2021,"Non-random sampling along ruralâurban gradients may reduce reliability of multi-species farmland bird indicators and their trends","Ibis","The continued global biodiversity crisis necessitates the continuation and development of new well-designed monitoring strategies and action plans with particular focus on under-represented countries and regions. However, limited resources in terms of budget and availability of qualified field personnel can restrict the geographical coverage of monitoring efforts. Focusing monitoring efforts on a representative subset of species and locations can improve cost-efficiency. Optimal performance of multi-species indicators derived from such an approach requires objective methods for species selection and a sampling design that reduces inherent sampling bias caused by regional differences in habitat availability or accessibility. To explore the performance of a multi-species indicator across different regions within a nation, we developed a multi-species indicator (msi) for farmland birds in norway using objective niche-based selection of species. We compare the performance of this indicator at national and regional scales (central and east regions) in norway, and between urban and rural sites within regions. The seven-species indicator obtained from the species selection provided similar indicator values and trends for norway and the central and east regions, as well as for rural sites within the combined centralâ +â east region. All trends were defined as showing moderate decline from 2007â2016. Urban sites within the combined centralâ +â east region provided trend estimates that showed stronger decline than rural areas in the same region during the time span. Our results emphasize the need to control for sampling bias when structuring monitoring programmes such as a breeding bird survey (bbs). This is especially important if limited resources restrict the geographical coverage of the monitoring scheme. We recommend that monitoring schemes follow a stratified random sampling design that represents both the availability of different land cover types and their distribution with regard to proximity to highly populated areas. If that is not possible, statistically weighting data from different regions or landscapes is likely to be necessary. Â© 2020 the authors.

375,2021,"Lessons learned while protecting wild chimpanzees in west africa","American Journal Of Primatology","Though human activities are postulated to be the main drivers of the worldwide biodiversity crisis, humans are also suggested by some to be an important part of the solution to the crisis. How can such a paradox be best solved? This paradox requires an adaptive, context-specific, dynamic solution, at a fine-grained scale that varies by location. The wild chimpanzee foundation (wcf) works on the ground in three west african countries: in cãte d'ivoire, where bushmeat consumption is a recurrent and generalized threat to wildlife, wcf used live theater performances in the villages to address this issue. Post-activity evaluations revealed that the more often individuals have been part of such awareness activities, the less they will consume bushmeat. In nearby liberia, where illegal miners have invaded many protected areas and intact forests, the wcf supports community watch teams (cwt) to patrol the sapo national park with forestry development authority staff. Within 11 months of its creation, the cwt patrols around and in the sapo national park resulted in thousands of illegal miners progressively leaving the national park. In guinea, where coexistence between humans and primates has prevailed based on religious traditions, the wcf developed a strategic approach, as the moyen-bafing national park contains about 5000 chimpanzees as well as some 255 villages. Therefore, we adopted an âintegrated landscape approachâ whereby the community activities are planned in combination with initiatives increasing forest regeneration and connectivity in high conservation value areas. Communities in northern guinea confronted with dramatic fluctuations due to climatic changes welcomed such activities that help them become more resilient and adaptable to those alterations. In conclusion, evidence-based information at the local level helps to resolve the conservation paradox by adapting with the local communities' context-specific dynamic approaches to enhance the conservation of great apes.

376,2021,"The effects of shrub encroachment on bird occupancy vary with land use in an african savanna","Animal Conservation","Land-cover and land-use change are major drivers of global biodiversity loss. Savannas are experiencing shrub encroachment and land-use changes that affect animal communities, yet how the effects of shrub encroachment vary with land use remains unclear. We also need to determine which species traits explain the effects of shrub encroachment and land-use changes to identify potential drivers of community change and predict species' responses to conservation efforts. We sampled birds across gradients of shrub encroachment and land use (protected savanna, pastures, homestead lands, and sugarcane) in the lowveld savanna of eswatini to: (1) test for the effects of shrub encroachment, land-use change, and their potential synergies on the occurrence of 48 species of birds; and (2) determine which species traits (those associated with nesting, foraging, or vulnerability to predation) explained species' associations with shrub encroachment and land-use change. We used bayesian multispecies occupancy models to account for imperfect detection, interpret species responses, and understand the effects of species traits. We found evidence for community-wide synergies between shrub encroachment and land-use effects on birds that varied with species' diets. Agricultural intensification had negative effects on the occurrence of most species examined, while shrub cover typically had positive effects which were stronger in pastures and homestead lands than in protected areas. The negative effects of land-use change were greatest for insectivores and cavity nesters, whereas insectivore occurrence increased with shrub cover, collectively indicating that nesting and foraging traits best explained species responses to land-use and land-cover change in the region. Our results suggest that shrub cover management for bird conservation should vary with land use: shrubs could be thinned in protected areas without reducing bird occupancy but shrubs in homesteads should be retained.

377,2021,"Genome-wide markers redeem the lost identity of a heavily managed gamebird","Proceedings Of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","Heavily managed wildlife may suffer from genetic homogenization and reshuffling of locally adapted genotypes with non-native ones. This phenomenon often affects natural populations by reducing their evolutionary potential and speeding up the ongoing biodiversity crisis. For decades, the red-legged partridge (alectoris rufa), an intensively managed gamebird of conservation concern and considerable socio-economic importance, has been subjected to extensive releases of farm-reared hybrids with the chukar partridge (alectoris chukar) and translocations irrespective of subspecific affinity. These practices have led to serious concerns that the genetic integrity and biogeographic structure of most red-legged partridge populations are irreversibly affected, as suggested by previous studies based on few genetic markers. Using over 168 000 genome-wide loci and a sampling across the entire a. Rufa range, we detected unexpectedly limited and spatially uneven chukar introgression as well as significant intraspecific structure. We demonstrate that species widely feared to have irretrievably lost their genetic identity are likely to be much less affected by unsuitable management practices than previously assumed. Our results spell the need for a radical re-think on animal conservation, possibly restoring native status to populations long treated as compromised. Our study exemplifies how the application of innovative conservation-genomic methods is key to solving wildlife management problems dealing with introgressive hybridization worldwide.

378,2021,"Amphibian responses to conventional and reduced impact logging","Forest Ecology And Management","Unsustainable timber management, primarily via conventional selective logging (cl), has resulted in severe habitat degradation and biodiversity loss. Sustainable techniques, principally reduced impact logging (ril), are therefore essential for conserving highly threatened, physiologically sensitive taxa such as amphibians. In this study we compare the effects of cl and ril on stream amphibians across a regeneration gradient in two forest reserves in sabah, malaysian borneo. We analysed data from a community of stream amphibians across 29 transects subject to either cl (18 â 21 years since logging) or ril (4 â 21). Multi-species occupancy modelling determined community and species responses to logging types, regeneration times and logging associated environmental factors. Diversity profiles, which capture representative diversity indices whilst accounting for community evenness, were calculated using occupancy model results. Our results indicated that several species and community occupancy generally responded negatively to logging associated covariates (lower aboveground carbon density and higher siltation). Stream breeding species occupancy was generally lower in cl compared to ril sites, with higher generalist breeding species occupancy in cl sites. Diversity profiles identified higher anuran diversity and evenness in ril compared to cl sites of the same age (18 â 21 years). Furthermore, anuran diversity and evenness exhibited a distinct recovery from 4 to 21 years following ril. Our results provide strong evidence that ril reduces the negative impacts on stream habitats, amphibian occupancy and diversity compared to cl, and suggest a far quicker recovery after ril. We believe ril presents a promising alternative for sustainable tropical timber management and stream amphibian conservation.

Alarming insect declines resulting from human activities have recently been documented in temperate and tropical ecosystems worldwide, but reliable data from tropical forests remain sparse. The sap-sucking tribe athysanini is one herbivore group sensitive to anthropogenic perturbation and the largest within the diverse insect family cicadellidae distributed in america's tropical forests. To measure the possible effects of deforestation and related activities on leafhopper biodiversity, a survey of 143 historic collecting localities was conducted to determine whether species documented in the mexican dry tropical forests during the 1920s to 1940s were still present. Biostatistical diversity analysis was performed to compare historical to recent data on species occurrences. A data matrix of 577 geographical records was analysed. In total, 374 athysanini data records were included representing 115 species of 41 genera. Historically, species richness and diversity were higher than found in the recent survey, despite greater collecting effort in the latter. A strong trend in species decline was observed (-53%) over 75 years in this endangered seasonally dry ecosystem. Species completeness was dissimilar between historic and present data. Endemic taxa were significantly less important and represented in the 1920s-1940s species records. All localities surveyed in the dry tropical forest are disturbed and reduced by modern anthropogenic processes. Mexico harbours highly endemic leafhopper taxa with a large proportion of these inhabiting the dry forest. These findings provide important data for conservation decision making and modelling of distribution patterns of this threatened seasonally dry tropical ecosystem.

However, correlates of risk can be nonlinear, within-species risk varies geographically, and current-day threats cannot reveal drivers of past losses. We investigated factors that regulated survival or extinction in caribbean mammals, which have experienced the globally highest level of human-caused postglacial mammalian extinctions, and included all extinct and extant holocene island populations of non-volant species (219 survivals or extinctions across 118 islands). Extinction selectivity shows a statistically detectable and complex body mass effect, with survival probability decreasing for both mass extremes, indicating that intermediate-sized species have been more resilient. A strong interaction between mass and age of first human arrival provides quantitative evidence of larger mammals going extinct on the earliest islands colonized, revealing an extinction filter caused by past human activities. Survival probability increases on islands with lower mean elevation (mostly small cays acting as offshore refugia) and decreases with more frequent hurricanes, highlighting the risk of extreme weather events and rising sea levels to surviving species on low-lying cays. These findings demonstrate the interplay between intrinsic biology, regional ecology and specific local threats, providing insights for understanding drivers of biodiversity loss across island systems and fragmented habitats worldwide.

This article discusses the opportunities and benefits of applying the concepts of regreening and rewilding of cities. The article engages with key sources and summarizes the background and development of regreening and natureâbased solutions and important policies, concerns and perspectives of international and national organizations. It introduces the integration of natureâbased solutions (nbs) as a strategy in urban planning with the aim to strengthen urban resilience and to slow down the biodiversity de-cline. Rewilding areas in cities has become a powerful strategy to bring back butterflies, insects, birds, and wildlife. In contrast to highly managed parks and gardens, these rewilding initiatives are leaving allotted spaces mostly uncultivated and selfâregulated. Contact to nature is essential for human existence, urban wellbeing, and good quality of life. Green spaces in citiesâbig or smallâall contribute to the health and wellbeing of residents. However, many cities do not offer residents easy access to green space within the city. Improving the better distribution of and access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks is likely to deliver a large number of benefits, such as: ecosystem services, better water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, and restoring damaged ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and nbs help to keep cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microcli-mate. Rewilding has emerged as an important part of new public parks and gardens. The next step is to upâscale citywide climate intervention strategies deployed to keep cities cool. However, as the discussion of this article shows, it is essential that the design of these nbs strategies is fully integrated with other complementary planning interventions and seeks synergies across all sectors.

383,2021,"Tropical land-use change alters trait-based community assembly rules for dung beetles and birds","Oecologia","Tropical rainforest disturbance and conversion are critical drivers of biodiversity loss. A key knowledge gap is understanding the impacts of habitat modification on mechanisms of community assembly, which are predicted to respond differently between taxa and across spatial scales. We use a null model approach to detect trait assembly of species at local- and landscape-scales, and then subdivide communities with different habitat associations and foraging guilds to investigate whether the detection of assembly mechanisms varies between groups. We focus on two indicator taxa, dung beetles and birds, across a disturbance gradient of primary rainforest, selectively logged rainforest, and oil palm plantations in borneo, southeast asia. Random community assembly was predominant for dung beetles across habitats, whereas trait convergence, indicative of environmental filtering, occurred across the disturbance gradient for birds. Assembly patterns at the two spatial scales were similar. Subdividing for habitat association and foraging guild revealed patterns hidden when focusing on the overall community. Dung beetle forest specialists and habitat generalists showed opposing assembly mechanisms in primary forest, community assembly of habitat generalists for both taxa differed with disturbance intensity, and insectivorous birds strongly influenced overall community assembly relative to other guilds. Our study reveals the sensitivity of community assembly mechanisms to anthropogenic disturbance via a shift in the relative contribution of stochastic and deterministic processes. This highlights the need for greater understanding of how habitat modification alters species interactions and the importance of incorporating speciesâ traits within assessments.

In spring, cranes consume planted corn kernels (zea mays), causing significant damage. From 1999 to 2001 and 2007 to 2009 we experimented with resolving crane damage. Seeds treated with either insecticides or anthraquinone (aq) were not consumed in planted fields while untreated seeds were, causing a 19.6% reduction in seedling density where cranes foraged. Insecticides tested were inappropriate for future use while performance of aq mimicked that of insecticides but was environmentally acceptable and economical to use. Though cranes selected germinating corn fields, regardless of treatment, they used fields containing treated corn without causing damage. Cranes were generalists when selecting food items within a field and likely switched food items when exposed to treated corn but were specialists when selecting field types within a home range. Deterrence at geographic scales where species are generalists may reduce the chance for habituation. Subsequent deployment of aq has been replicated with other bird species and crops at landscape scales.

Few studies, however, include a long-term perspective of climate change. Without explicit integration, such long-term temperature trends and their interactions with short-term climate change may be so dominant that they blur or even reverse the apparent direct relationship between climate change and extinction. Here we evaluate how observed genus-level extinctions of arthropods, bivalves, cnidarians, echinoderms, foraminifera, gastropods, mammals and reptiles in the geological past can be predicted from the interaction of long-term temperature trends with short-term climate change. We compare synergistic palaeoclimate interaction (a short-term change on top of a long-term trend in the same direction) to antagonistic palaeoclimate interaction such as long-term cooling followed by short-term warming. Synergistic palaeoclimate interaction increases extinction risk by up to 40%. The memory of palaeoclimate interaction including the climate history experienced by ancestral lineages can be up to 60 myr long. The effect size of palaeoclimate interaction is similar to other key factors such as geographic range, abundance or clade membership.

Land use planning initiatives seeking to optimize wildlife conservation are hindered by a lack of baseline data quantifying speciesâ tolerance to human-modified landscapes. Objectives: we explored the influence of landscape characteristics on the fine-scale space-use patterns of a model generalist carnivore, the malay civet (viverra tangalunga), within degraded tropical forests and oil palm plantations. Methods: we collected over 20,000 gps locations from 21 male civets in sabah, malaysian borneo to evaluate the speciesâ space-use patterns and habitat utilization processes. We used movement-based modeling to determine home ranges, and combined the results with high-resolution remotely sensed habitat characteristics. We developed resource utilization functions to determine individual and population-level functional responses to proximity to plantation edge, distance to water, terrain ruggedness, forest structure, and functional diversity. Results: civets foraged within oil palm plantations, yet all animals utilized forests. Home ranges scaled with proportion of plantation within both total and core ranges. Resource utilization functions reported individualism in the speciesâ responses to habitat characteristics. At the population-scale, civets consistently and more intensely used habitats closer to plantation edges and taller tree canopies. Conclusions: although plantations did not pose an inhospitable matrix, oil palm agriculture is a less suitable habitat than remnant forests for civets. Proximity measures and forest structure influenced the spatial behaviors of this adaptable generalist, highlighting the importance of protected areas. We recommend land-sparing and -sharing approaches to facilitate carnivore persistence across oil palm degraded landscapes.

In light of the global biodiversity crisis, conducting high-quality biodiversity impact assessments is important, as biodiversity information, among other factors, has the potential to influence how projects will be implemented in the end. We investigated the biodiversity and bird surveys conducted and the number of bird species of conservation concern in peat extraction and wind farm projects to which an eia was applied to in 1995â2016 in finland and compared whether these factors differed between the project types and between implemented and unimplemented projects. We also studied the availability of follow-up monitoring data of biodiversity impacts within the two project types. The number of nationally threatened breeding birds was significantly lower in implemented than in unimplemented peat extraction projects. The overall probability of being implemented was significantly negatively associated with the year the eia began for both project types. All permitted peat extraction projects and 22% of wind farm projects conducted post-construction biodiversity monitoring; however, only some projects enabled before-after comparisons. Our results are in line with earlier findings that demonstrate the difficulty of showing the direct impacts of biodiversity information on eia decision-making and to what extent it is related to project approval or rejection.

388,2021,"Landscape heterogeneity shapes bird phylogenetic responses at forestâmatrix interfaces in atlantic forest, brazil","Biotropica","Agricultural intensification is one of the major factors driving biodiversity loss. However, most studies in human-dominated landscapes have used taxonomic diversity in their analysis, ignoring evolutionary relationships. Consequently, the relationship between landscape structure and phylogenetic diversity is not well understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that landscape heterogeneity is positively related to bird phylogenetic indexes of diversity and structure, leading to over-dispersed phylogenies in very heterogeneous landscapes. We analyzed phylogenetic responses in interfaces between forest edges and anthropogenic matrices (forestâpasture and forestâeucalyptus) using generalized linear mixed models. We also compared these indexes between land covers to assess which one best preserves the phylogenetic history of communities. We used both traditional phylogenetic indexes and those corrected for species richness. Our results showed that phylogenetic diversity varied significantly between land cover types, but this did not occur when we removed effects associated with species richness, suggesting that all land covers preserve similar levels of evolutionary history. Additionally, our best models showed a positive relationship between landscape heterogeneity and bird phylogenetic indexes of diversity and structure, but the strength of these relationships may be land cover dependent. In summary, our work highlights the influence of landscape heterogeneity on the phylogenetic diversity and structure of bird communities, reinforcing the need for its incorporation into conservation-based studies.

In freshwaters, the anthropogenic manipulation of fish communities has resulted in altered fish communities, and in europe has increased the complexity of phoxinus species assemblages. Here, we investigated the phoxinus communities of the westernmost part of the po river basin, where adjacent freshwater ecosystems (alpine high-altitude lakes and lowland streams) are representative of different management strategies (i.e. Manipulated fish communities via stocking in alpine lakes vs. Natural populations in streams). We tested the genetic composition of the cryptic phoxinus populations inhabiting these waters, as the species are morphologically indistinct. Sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase i (coi) were obtained from 239 specimens, with the results indicating that 17 alpine high-altitude lakes are now populated by a complex of phoxinus species, comprising p. Septimaniae (native to the mediterranean area of france), p. Csikii (native to the central balkans) and p. Lumaireul (native to the north adriatic sea basins). Their introduction resulted from their use as angling live baits. Minnow populations in lowland streams were primarily comprised of native p. Lumaireul, with only a single p. Csikii specimen detected. While nuclear sequences of the recombination activating gene 1 (rag1) marker were not useful for tracking the presence of alien alleles in these stream populations, the coi data emphasised the importance of using molecular tools to investigate cryptic species complexes that have been modified by anthropogenic activities.

Collation and analysis of expert opinion indicated that six species are at high risk (>50%) of becoming extinct within the next 20 years, and up to 11 species could be lost within this timeframe unless management improves. The consensus among experts was that neither of the ew species were likely to persist outside of small fenced areas without a significant increase in resources for intense threat management. The 20 most imperilled species are all restricted in range, with three occurring only on islands. The others are endemic to a single state, with 55% occurring in queensland. Invasive species (notably weeds and introduced predators) were the most prevalent threats, followed by agriculture, natural system modifications (primarily fire) and climate change. Increased resourcing and management intervention are urgently needed to avert the impending extinction of australia's imperilled terrestrial reptiles.

392,2021,"Bad neighbours: amphibian chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis infection dynamics in three co-occurring frog species of southern sydney, australia","Diseases Of Aquatic Organisms","Wildlife disease is a major cause of global biodiversity loss. Amongst the most devastating is the disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd). This disease has contributed to declines and extinctions in hundreds of amphibian species, but not all species are affected equally. Some amphibian hosts are capable of carrying high levels of bd infection without population declines, acting as reservoir species for the pathogen and driving population declines in sympatric species. In australia, several species have been proposed as reservoir species; however, our understanding of bd is derived from studies that are highly geographically and taxonomically biased, and our ability to extrapolate from these systems is unknown. We examined the prevalence and intensity of bd infection in 3 frog species in a previously unstudied host-pathogen system in temperate eastern australia: the blue mountains tree frog litoria citropa, a poorly-known species predicted to be susceptible to bd infection; and the common eastern froglet crinia signifera and the stony creek frog l. Lesueuri, which have both been identified as reservoir species in other regions. We found that l. Citropa and l. Lesueuri were infected with bd at a high prevalence and often high intensity, while the reverse was true for c. Signifera. All species were detected at moderate abundance and there was no evidence of morbidity and mortality. Our findings do not support c. Signifera and l. Lesueuri being reservoir species in this system, highlighting the importance of region-specific studies to inform conservation management.","10.3354/dao03557","Scopus","Scopus_392",249,0.400514684208262,-0.167452757982087,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
393,2021,"Community-level modelling of boreal forest mammal distribution in an oil sands landscape","Science Of The Total Environment","Anthropogenic landscape disturbances are known to alter, destroy, and fragment habitat, which typically leads to biodiversity loss. The effects of landscape disturbance generally vary among species and depend on the nature of the disturbances, which may interact and result in synergistic effects. Western canada's oil sands region experiences disturbances from forestry and energy sector activities as well as municipal and transportation infrastructure. The effects of those disturbances on single species have been studied and have been implicated in declines of the boreal woodland caribou (rangifer tarandus caribou). Yet, the specific responses of the mammal community, and of functional groups such as prey and predators, to those interacting disturbances are still poorly known. We investigated the responses of black bear, grey wolf, coyote, fisher, lynx, red fox, american red squirrel, white-tailed deer, moose, caribou, and snowshoe hare to both natural habitat and disturbance associated with anthropogenic features within alberta's northeast boreal forest. We used a novel community-level modelling framework on three years of camera-trap data collected in an oil sands landscape. This framework allowed us to identify the natural and anthropogenic features which explained the most variation in occurrence frequency among functional groups, as well as compare responses to linear and non-linear anthropogenic disturbance. Occurrence frequency by predators was better explained by anthropogenic features than by natural habitat. Both linear and non-linear anthropogenic features helped explain occurrence frequency by prey and predators, although the effects differed in magnitude and spatial scale. To better conserve boreal biodiversity, management actions should extend beyond a focus on caribou and wolves and aim to restore habitat across a diversity of anthropogenic disturbances and monitor the dynamics of the entire mammal community.

Here we integrate genomics and environmental modelling to assess climate change responses in an ecologically and economically important arctic species. Environmentally associated genomic diversity and machine learning are used to identify highly vulnerable populations of anadromous (migratory) arctic charr, and we reconstruct estimates of effective population size spanning the twentieth century to identify past climate-associated declines. We uncover past region-wide declines in effective population size that correspond to decreases in temperature and community biomass in the northwest atlantic. We find vulnerable populations near the southern range limit, indicating northward shifts and a possible loss of commercially important life-history variation in response to climate change. The genomic approach used here to investigate climate change response identifies past and future declines that impact species persistence, ecosystem stability and food security in the arctic.

395,2021,"Conservation genetics of regionally extinct peregrine falcons (falco peregrinus) and unassisted recovery without genetic bottleneck in southern england","Conservation Genetics","The peregrine falcon (falco peregrinus) has been affected by persecution, pollution, trade, and habitat degradation, but it is considered a flagship conservation success story because of successful reintroductions and population recoveries across broad ranges. However, in the uk there were never formal reintroduction programmes for peregrine falcons, and it appears that uk populationsâand specifically the sussex peregrines of the english south coastârecently recovered from a population crash unassisted. To study this, we obtained samples from contemporary populations in southern england, ireland, continental europe, domestic-bred peregrine falcons, and from england pre-population crash. Using microsatellite and mtdna control region data, the genetic diversity and structure, signatures of genetic bottlenecks, and potential origin of the sussex peregrines was investigated. We found low levels of genetic diversity across all peregrine falcon groups, low but significant genetic differentiation, and a few private alleles, indicating some level of genetic structure among european peregrines. Although we could not pinpoint the origin of the sussex peregrines, the data suggests that it is not likely to have originated from escaped domestic birds or from adjacent european populations. The results obtained here parallel other studies on peregrines elsewhere showing low genetic diversity but genetic structure. We conclude that not enough time elapsed for genetic erosion to occur due to the population bottleneck, and that at least for the sussex peregrines there is no need for genetic conservation by wild-take and subsequent captive breeding programmes as long as current protection measures remain in place.

396,2021,"Leopards and mesopredators as indicators of mammalian species richness across diverse landscapes of south africa","Ecological Indicators","The rapid extinction of species over the past few decades has created a biodiversity crisis. Factors contributing to recent extirpations are linked to increased human population growth, habitat loss and fragmentation, and over-exploitation of wildlife. Only decisive, effective action to combat biodiversity loss can reverse these trends. The use of indicator species as surrogates for biodiversity provides a way to identify areas with high biodiversity so that conservation efforts can be accelerated and supported in those areas. Predators are considered important indicators of healthy, biodiverse ecosystems due to their high trophic level and their direct and indirect interaction with other species. Using camera trap data from 221 cameras set across five vegetation types and five land use zones in south africa, we evaluated carnivores as potential surrogates for biodiversity. We used the leopard (panthera pardus), and three meso-predators: caracal (caracal caracal), honey badger (mellivora capensis), and black-backed jackal (canis mesomelas), as candidate indicator species. We used mammals captured at the camera traps as a measure of biodiversity referred to as mammalian species richness. The mammalian species richness was highest in the orange river nama karoo vegetation type and in privately owned game reserves. We found that predator sightings were associated with significantly higher mammalian species richness which increased with increasing number of predator species. These findings suggest that the surrogate species concept can be applied to leopard and meso-predators.

397,2021,"Spatial modelling of temporal dynamics in stream fish communities under anthropogenic change","Diversity And Distributions","Aim: understanding temporal changes in aquatic communities is essential to address the freshwater biodiversity crisis. In particular, it is important to understand the patterns and drivers of spatial variation in local community dynamics, generalizing temporal trends from discrete locations to entire landscapes that are the main focus of management. Here, we present a framework for producing spatially continuous views of community dynamics, focusing on stream fish affected by hydropower development. Location: river sabor, ne portugal. Methods: we sampled stream fish at thirty sites between 2012 and 2019. Community trajectory analysis was used to quantify the directionality and velocity of community change, and the geometric resemblance of community trajectories between sites. Geostatistical models for stream networks were used to relate metrics describing community dynamics to environmental variables, while controlling for euclidean and hydrologic spatial dependencies, and to map spatial variation in community dynamics across the watershed. Results: trajectories in multivariate space underlined strong temporal dynamics, with local communities deviating and returning to previous states, but without evidence for directional changes. Accordingly, directionality values were low and not consistently affected by environmental variables. The velocity of community change varied markedly across the watershed and it was strongly affected by stream order and elevation, with faster changes observed in lowland streams draining into hydroelectric reservoirs and with a high proportion of exotic species. Pairwise distances between community trajectories were strongly related to hydrologic and environmental distances between sites. Main conclusions: local stream fish communities were in a loose equilibrium across the watershed, but they fluctuated at a faster rate closer to a hydroelectric reservoir. Integrating community trajectory analysis and geostatistical modelling provides a relatively simple framework to understand how, where and why temporal community dynamics vary across dendritic stream networks and to visualize spatial patterns of community change over time in relation to anthropogenic impacts.

398,2021,"Do the eu's common agricultural policy funds negatively affect the diversity of farmland birds? Evidence from slovenia","Agriculture, Ecosystems And Environment","The paper investigates the relative influence of landscape characteristics, production intensity and the eu's common agricultural policy interventions on the diversity of farmland birds. For this purpose, data from the farmland bird monitoring scheme in slovenia and high spatial resolution data from the national agricultural databases in the period 2008â2019 were analysed with the boosted regression trees (brt). The diversity of farmland birds was found to be highest in open, diversely cropped and extensively to moderately intensively managed landscapes in natura 2000 sites where farm holdings were allocated a low average amount of both direct payments and payments for agri-environmental measures (aem) and organic farming (of). Furthermore, the highest diversity of the subgroup of grassland specialists was associated with very open and extensively managed grassland landscapes with low stocking density (<0.7 lu/ha). By contrast, the diversity of habitat generalists was highest in heterogeneous landscapes with a high diversity of land-use types, measured at the broader spatial scale. Areas with a higher allocation of direct payments and payments for aem and of were associated with lower farmland bird diversity, whereas high diversity was found in natura 2000 sites and in some areas with natural constraints (lfa). Agri-environmental measures and the âgreeningâ measures had a negligible relative influence on bird diversity, possibly due to ineffective implementation and low uptake by beneficiaries. The intensification of production, particularly in the beef and dairy sectors, which has been supported by the common agricultural policy direct payments, and forest succession in marginal areas were identified as the potential key drivers of the recent farmland biodiversity loss in slovenia. The future cap income support schemes should be redesigned to ensure at least neutral if not positive overall effects on farmland biodiversity by gradual phasing-out of references to (historic) production levels, increased conditionality and more effective voluntary agri-environmental measures.

399,2021,"Historical natural disturbances shape spruce primary forest structure and indirectly influence bird assemblage composition","Forest Ecology And Management","Understanding the processes shaping the composition of assemblages in response to disturbance events is crucial for preventing ongoing biodiversity loss in forest ecosystems. However, studies of forest biodiversity responses to disturbance typically analyze immediate or short-term impacts only, while studies relating long-term disturbance history to biodiversity assemblage dynamics are rare. To address this important knowledge gap, we used a dendroecological approach to link natural disturbance history of 250 years (1750â2000) to structural habitat elements and, in turn, to breeding bird assemblages. We used data collected in 2017 and 2018 from 58 permanent study plots within 10 primary spruce forest stands distributed across the western carpathian mountains of europe. This dataset contained breeding bird counts and environmental variables describing forest density, tree diameter distribution, tree height, tree microhabitats, deadwood quantity and quality, and regeneration. Bird assemblages were significantly influenced by forest structure which was in turn shaped by disturbance dynamics (disturbance frequency, time since the last disturbance and its severity). Early successional species associated with more open habitats were positively influenced by disturbance-related structure (i.e. Deadwood-related variables, canopy cover), while some species responded negatively. At the same time, overall abundance, species richness and shannon diversity of the bird assemblage remained unchanged under variable disturbance histories. Our results support a view of primary spruce forests as a highly dynamic ecosystem, harbouring populations of bird species at all stages of succession despite significant structural changes and shifting patch mosaics over time due to natural disturbances.

400,2021,"Observer retention, site selection and population dynamics interact to bias abundance trends in bats","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Many long-term wildlife population monitoring programmes rely on citizen scientists for data collection. This can offer several benefits over traditional monitoring practices as it is a cost-effective, large-scale approach capable of providing long time series data and raising public environmental awareness. Whilst there is a debate about the quality of citizen science data, a standardised sampling design can allow citizen science data to be of a similar quality to those collected by professionals. However, many programmes use subjective, opportunistic selection of monitoring sites and this introduces several types of bias, which are not well understood. Using bat roost counts as a case study, we took a âvirtual ecologistâ approach to simulate the effect of opportunistic site selection and uneven observer retention on our ability to accurately detect abundance trends. We simulated populations with different levels of temporal variability and site fidelity. Our simulations reveal that opportunistic site selection and low observer retention can result in biased trends and that these biases are magnified when monitored populations exhibit high levels of inter-annual variation and low site fidelity. These results show that the synergistic effects of observer behaviour, site selection, and population dynamics lead to biased abundance trends in monitoring programmes. This study highlights the value of engaging and retaining citizen science observers, a standardised sampling design, and the collection of metadata. We conclude that monitoring programmes need to be aware of their focal species' temporal variability and site fidelity to adequately assess the potential bias caused by opportunistic site selection and low observer retention. Synthesis and applications. Accurate data on population changes are key for conservation success. Therefore, it is important that citizen science monitoring programmes assess and potentially quantify the biases present in their data. We demonstrate the applicability of an established simulation framework to assess the effect of biases on our ability to correctly detect abundance trends. Our findings highlight that monitoring programmes need to be aware of their study speciesâ temporal variability and site fidelity to assess and account for the effects of biased site selection and observer retention.

401,2021,"Quantifying the relative performance of two undetected-extinction models","Conservation Biology","Extinctions of undiscovered species (undetected extinctions) constitute a portion of biodiversity loss that is often ignored. We compared the performance of 2 models of undetected extinctions â tedesco and seux â when estimating undetected extinctions with both simulated and real-world data. We generated simulated data by considering a birth-death process in which less abundant species were more likely to go extinct. When detection rates were higher for common species, the 2 models underestimated the true number of undetected extinctions by up to 88.7%, and when detection rates were independent of abundance, the 2 models performed better; the seux model had an average bias of +3.1% and the tedesco model had an average bias of â62.3%. We applied the models to 8 real-world data sets (e.g., australian amphibians, australian birds, north american bivalves) and found that true extinctions may be from 15% to 180% higher than observed values. For 6 of the 8 data sets, the seux model yielded absolute estimates that were 5.7â66.8% lower than those of the tedesco model. We mainly attributed this difference to the seux model's assumption that there are no undetected extant species currently. We assessed the accuracy of the modelsâ estimates with a logistic regression to test whether detection and extinction rates were uncorrelated across species. Rates were correlated for 3 of the 8 data sets; species discovered later had a higher probability of being extinct, suggesting that extinction numbers could be even higher for these groups. Despite caveats associated with the models, the evidence from both show biodiversity loss in these groups may be more severe than what has been documented.

402,2021,"The challenge of biased evidence in conservation","Conservation Biology","Efforts to tackle the current biodiversity crisis need to be as efficient and effective as possible given chronic underfunding. To inform decision-makers of the most effective conservation actions, it is important to identify biases and gaps in the conservation literature to prioritize future evidence generation. We used the conservation evidence database to assess the state of the global literature that tests conservation actions for amphibians and birds. For the studies in the database, we investigated their spatial and taxonomic extent and distribution across biomes, effectiveness metrics, and study designs. Studies were heavily concentrated in western europe and north america for birds and particularly for amphibians, and temperate forest and grassland biomes were highly represented relative to their percentage of land coverage. Studies that used the most reliable study designsâbefore-after control-impact and randomized controlled trialsâwere the most geographically restricted and scarce in the evidence base. There were negative spatial relationships between the numbers of studies and the numbers of threatened and data-deficient species worldwide. Taxonomic biases and gaps were apparent for amphibians and birdsâsome entire orders were absent from the evidence baseâwhereas others were poorly represented relative to the proportion of threatened species they contained. Metrics used to evaluate effectiveness of conservation actions were often inconsistent between studies, potentially making them less directly comparable and evidence synthesis more difficult. Testing conservation actions on threatened species outside western europe, north america, and australasia should be prioritized. Standardizing metrics and improving the rigor of study designs used to test conservation actions would also improve the quality of the evidence base for synthesis and decision-making.

Our aim was to investigate how urbanization shapes species richness (sr) and composition of anuran communities in nw argentina, and to determine which suite of life history traits are related to anuran tolerance to urban development. We classified anuranâ species in functional groups (fg) based on a series of ecological traits and recognized them as urban-tolerant or urban-avoiders. We constructed an urbanization composite index (ui) through an exploratory factor analysis based on measures of artificial light intensity, noise pollution, land use types, and mean values of lts, ndmi, and ndvi. We tested the response of sr, fg and species occurrence to ui with generalized linear models and a variation partitioning analysis. Our results showed the negative influence of urbanization on anuran diversity and suggested that the loss of anuran species is not random, pointing to the presence of environmental filters. Only terrestrial frogs that build aquatic foam nests were not affected by an increase in urbanization, so they may be considered as urban--tolerant. Further, our results highlighted the important role of dispersal capacity in structuring the urban anuran assemblages. As ecologists working in urban habitats, we emphasize the need of a more comprehensive and generalized understanding of ecological and life history traits associated with urban tolerant anurans.

404,2021,"Fragmentation effects on woodlark habitat selection depend on habitat amount and spatial scale","Animal Conservation","Habitat loss and fragmentation are key drivers of biodiversity loss. However, they are usually confounded, making it difficult to separate fragmentation effects from those of habitat loss. In addition, it has been shown that often fragmentation negatively affects biodiversity only below a certain threshold of habitat amount. We investigated the separate and interactive effects of habitat amount and fragmentation on habitat selection of the woodlark at 10 spatial scales. In southern switzerland this passerine mainly breeds in ground-vegetated vineyards, which therefore represent the focal habitat type in this study. Additionally, we investigated land cover, topographic and climatic variables at the same 10 scales to obtain a holistic picture of species-habitat associations. Habitat selection was analyzed at two hierarchical levels: home range selection within the study area and habitat use within home ranges. Home range selection was strongly driven by an interactive effect of habitat amount and fragmentation: woodlarks avoided fragmented areas if habitat amount was below 20% but exhibited a preference for fragmented areas if habitat amount exceeded this threshold. Both habitat amount and fragmentation most strongly affected habitat use at the 100â m scale. We did not find such interactive effects for habitat use within home ranges. At this level, habitat amount at a 50â m scale influenced woodlark presence positively with no significant effects of fragmentation. Furthermore, woodlarks preferred evenly sloped landscape mosaics interspersed with steppes and groves. Two main insights emerge from our study. First, these results highlight the necessity of studying scale explicit and interactive effects of habitat amount and fragmentation when addressing ecological questions, such as habitat selection in birds. Second, we provide management recommendations for farmers: more vineyards should be vegetated and arranged as disjunct patches where their surface covers more than 20% of the landscape but be aggregated where vegetated area is lower.

A lot of factors have contributed to it: deforestation, changes in forest habitats, poorly regulated agricultural surfaces, mismanaged urban growth. They have altered the composition of wildlife communities, greatly increased the contacts of humans with wildlife, and altered niches that harbor pathogens, increasing their chances to come in contact with humans. Among the wildlife, bats have adapted easily to anthropized environments such as houses, barns, cultivated fields, orchards, where they found the suitable ecosystem to prosper. Bats are major hosts for îcov and îcov: evolution has shaped their peculiar physiology and their immune system in a way that makes them resistant to viral pathogens that would instead successfully attack other species, including humans. In time, the coronaviruses that bats host as reservoirs have undergone recombination and other modifications that have increased their ability for inter-species transmission: one modification of particular importance has been the development of the ability to use ace2 as a receptor in host cells. This particular development in covs has been responsible for the serious outbreaks in the last two decades, and for the present covid-19 pandemic.

406,2021,"How do habitat amount and habitat fragmentation drive time-delayed responses of biodiversity to land-use change?","Proceedings Of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","Land-use change is a root cause of the extinction crisis, but links between habitat change and biodiversity loss are not fully understood. While there is evidence that habitat loss is an important extinction driver, the relevance of habitat fragmentation remains debated. Moreover, while time delays of biodiversity responses to habitat transformation are well-documented, time-delayed effects have been ignored in the habitat loss versus fragmentation debate. Here, using a hierarchical bayesian multi-species occupancy framework, we systematically tested for time-delayed responses of bird and mammal communities to habitat loss and to habitat fragmentation. We focused on the argentine chaco, where deforestation has been widespread recently. We used an extensive field dataset on birds and mammals, along with a time series of annual woodland maps from 1985 to 2016 covering recent and historical habitat transformations. Contemporary habitat amount explained bird and mammal occupancy better than past habitat amount. However, occupancy was affected more by the past rather than recent fragmentation, indicating a time-delayed response to fragmentation. Considering past landscape patterns is therefore crucial for understanding current biodiversity patterns. Not accounting for land-use history ignores the possibility of extinction debt and can thus obscure impacts of fragmentation, potentially explaining contrasting findings of habitat loss versus fragmentation studies.

407,2021,"Behavioral and demographic responses of mule deer to energy development on winter range","Wildlife Monographs","Anthropogenic habitat modification is a major driver of global biodiversity loss. In north america, one of the primary sources of habitat modification over the last 2 decades has been exploration for and production of oil and natural gas (hydrocarbon development), which has led to demographic and behavioral impacts to numerous wildlife species. Developing effective measures to mitigate these impacts has become a critical task for wildlife managers and conservation practitioners. However, this task has been hindered by the difficulties involved in identifying and isolating factors driving population responses. Current research on responses of wildlife to development predominantly quantifies behavior, but it is not always clear how these responses scale to demography and population dynamics. Concomitant assessments of behavior and population-level processes are needed to gain the mechanistic understanding required to develop effective mitigation approaches. We simultaneously assessed the demographic and behavioral responses of a mule deer population to natural gas development on winter range in the piceance basin of colorado, usa, from 2008 to 2015. Notably, this was the period when development declined from high levels of active drilling to only production phase activity (i.e., no drilling). We focused our data collection on 2 contiguous mule deer winter range study areas that experienced starkly different levels of hydrocarbon development within the piceance basin. We assessed mule deer behavioral responses to a range of development features with varying levels of associated human activity by examining habitat selection patterns of nearly 400 individual adult female mule deer. Concurrently, we assessed the demographic and physiological effects of natural gas development by comparing annual adult female and overwinter fawn (6-month-old animals) survival, december fawn mass, adult female late and early winter body fat, age, pregnancy rates, fetal counts, and lactation rates in december between the 2 study areas. Strong differences in habitat selection between the 2 study areas were apparent. Deer in the less-developed study area avoided development during the day and night, and selected habitat presumed to be used for foraging. Deer in the heavily developed study area selected habitat presumed to be used for thermal and security cover to a greater degree. Deer faced with higher densities of development avoided areas with more well pads during the day and responded neutrally or selected for these areas at night. Deer in both study areas showed a strong reduction in use of areas around well pads that were being drilled, which is the phase of energy development associated with the greatest amount of human presence, vehicle traffic, noise, and artificial light. Despite divergent habitat selection patterns, we found no effects of development on individual condition or reproduction and found no differences in any of the physiological or vital rate parameters measured at the population level. However, deer density and annual increases in density were higher in the low-development area. Thus, the recorded behavioral alterations did not appear to be associated with demographic or physiological costs measured at the individual level, possibly because populations are below winter range carrying capacity. Differences in population density between the 2 areas may be a result of a population decline prior to our study (when development was initiated) or area-specific differences in habitat quality, juvenile dispersal, or neonatal or juvenile survival; however, we lack the required data to contrast evidence for these mechanisms. Given our results, it appears that deer can adjust to relatively high densities of well pads in the production phase (the period with markedly lower human activity on the landscape), provided there is sufficient vegetative and topographic cover afforded to them and populations are below carrying capacity. The strong reaction to wells in the drilling phase of development suggests mitigation efforts should focus on this activity and stage of development. Many of the wells in this area were directionally drilled from multiple-well pads, leading to a reduced footprint of disturbance, but were still related to strong behavioral responses. Our results also indicate the likely value of mitigation efforts focusing on reducing human activity (i.e., vehicle traffic, light, and noise). In combination, these findings indicate that attention should be paid to the spatial configuration of the final development footprint to ensure adequate cover. In our study system, minimizing the road network through landscape-level development planning would be valuable (i.e., exploring a maximum road density criteria). Lastly, our study highlights the importance of concomitant assessments of behavior and demography to provide a comprehensive understanding of how wildlife respond to habitat modification.

It is a recognized source, destination, and transit point for the global wildlife trade, which drives biodiversity loss. There is an abundance of data from the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (cites) on the philippines, but this data has not been assessed for historical trends. Confiscation data reflecting the illegal trade is scarcer, coming from recent (2008 onward) records of the department of environment and natural resources â biodiversity management bureau (denr-bmb) and the palawan council for sustainable development (pcsd). Cites data from 1975 to 2018 include over 16 million units of animals or animal parts from 20,728 trade records. Birds are the most traded taxon at 43.92% of all trade records, and the usa has been the largest importer of wildlife from the philippines. Denr-bmb and pcsd records show that birds and reptiles each account for 36.46% of confiscated species. Reptiles, particularly sea turtles, are the most frequently traded in the illegal markets. Many species of animals that appear in all three databases are endemic to the philippines but not afforded enough protection by cites or national laws and documents such as the philippine red list. Temporal trends in both legal and illegal wildlife trade should strongly influence conservation strategies and policies aimed at controlling the trade of wildlife from the philippines, including reassessment of the conservation status and possible inclusion in cites appendices of problematic endemic species.

Understanding and preventing biodiversity loss is particularly important in rapidly changing and biodiversity-rich areas like the neotropics and requires exploring the role of both intrinsic and extrinsic vulnerability drivers. Here, we test how multiple potential intrinsic and extrinsic factors explain vulnerability to extinction in neotropical birds to provide a first insight into what makes these species susceptible to extinction and how they are responding to anthropization. Our analyses included data for 2268 neotropical birds. We characterized extinction risk based on the iucn red list categorization and tested the predictive value of seven intrinsic and four extrinsic variables using bayesian mcmc phylogenetic generalized least-squares (pgls) models. As hypothesized, we found higher intrinsic vulnerability to extinction among bigger and more specialized species which have low reproductive output and occupy smaller distribution ranges. Extrinsic drivers were also relevant predictors with more threatened species overlapping largely areas with fewer human activities (lower night light levels and lower human population densities). Our results show that the extinction risk of neotropical birds is correlated with both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic vulnerabilities were as expected associated with narrower, specialized niches and slower life histories. However, risk was not higher in more humanized environments, but instead more at-risk species were found in less disturbed areas that we suggest may represent refuges for birds that previously occurred in wider ranges and have now been excluded from the more anthropized regions. Our results contribute to our understanding of vulnerability predictors in birds and provide a first evaluation of neotropical birds that highlights the complex relationship between human pressure and biodiversity loss.

Streams and lakes are notably prone to biodiversity loss, being the greatest threats habitat destructions and nonnative species. The aim of the present study is to assess the fish composition of lotic and lentic water systems of an island ecosystem (gãkãeada island, turkey), which is poorly studied, and to highlight the entry routes and possible impacts of translocated fish species in an island ecosystem. The field surveys were conducted in a total of 14 sampling sites (five reservoirs and nine streams) in the inland waters of gãkãeada island between september 2019 and january 2021. Fish samples were collected by electrofishing (samus 1000; a backpack electro-shocker). A total of eight fish species belonging to six families (anguillidae, atherinidae, cyprinidae, leuciscidae, mugilidae, and poeciliidae) were determined. As a result fish community of the island was mostly composed by the introduced species carassius gibelio, gambusia holbrooki and pseudorasbora parva. This study provides the first detailed information on the distribution of the fish species encountered in the inland waters of gãkãeada island.

We applied structured expert elicitation to 26 frogs assessed as critically endangered and endangered to estimate their probability of extinction by 2040. We also investigated whether participant experience (measured as a self-assigned categorical score, i.e. 'Expert' or 'non-expert') influenced the estimates. Collation and analysis of participant opinion indicated that eight species are at high risk (>50% chance) of becoming extinct by 2040, with the disease chytridiomycosis identified as the primary threat. A further five species are at moderate-high risk (30-50% chance), primarily due to climate change. Fourteen of the 26 frog species are endemic to queensland, with many species restricted to small geographic ranges that are susceptible to stochastic events (e.g. A severe heatwave or a large bushfire). Experts were more likely to rate extinction probability higher for poorly known species (those with <10 experts), while non-experts were more likely to rate extinction probability higher for better-known species. However, scores converged following discussion, indicating that there was greater consensus in the estimates of extinction probability. Increased resourcing and management intervention are urgently needed to avert future extinctions of australia's frogs.

412,2021,"Relationship between lake area and distance from the city centre on lake-dependent resident and migratory birds in urban bangalore, a tropical mega-city in southern india","Journal Of Urban Ecology","Urbanization is one of the major causes of biodiversity loss worldwide. Some species are able to adapt to urbanization, whereas others perish. Studies on long-term effects of the impact of urbanization on species diversity and abundance patterns are especially lacking from tropical cities. We seek to assess the relationship between urbanization and species richness of lake-dependent birds in bangalore, a tropical mega-city in southern india. We specifically ask: (i) how is bird species richness related to the size of the lake? (Ii) how is bird species richness in bangalore's lakes related to the degree of urbanization? We used data from 2014 to 2019, collected from ebird - an online database that collates information on bird observations globally. Both lake area and distance from the city centre are correlated to species richness, with larger lakes supporting more bird species. As distance from the city centre increased (i.e. Urbanization decreases), bird richness increased. Overall, in the city of bangalore, migratory birds have declined while many lake-dependent resident birds seem to be increasing over the past 5 years. We hypothesize that birds that roost and nest in trees appear to be increasing. To confirm this, further research taking a trait-based approach is required. Urbanization appears to have species-specific impacts on lake-dependent birds in this tropical city, with certain groups of birds faring better than others. This research adds to the significant paucity of studies of the impact of urbanization on biodiversity in the urban tropics. Â© 2021 the author(s) 2021.

We sampled fish assemblages in 2017 and 2018 to investigate changes in assemblage structure (species richness and beta diversity), comparing these data with the historic species pool. We recorded 60 fish species, of which 16 were native and 44 non-native with 19 translocated, and 25 exotic. The exotics poecilia reticulata, xiphophorus maculatus, x. Variatus, danio rerio, and misgurnus anguillicaudatus were the most widely distributed in the headwater creeks. The contamination index showed that most creeks had high proportional contamination by exotic species (above 60%). Beta diversity increased from historical to contemporary periods in all creeks due to the introduction and differential colonization pressure of several non-native translocated and exotic species, indicating biotic differentiation. Temperature and number of ponds were the main preditors of change in beta diversity in the headwater creeks during the contemporary period. In summary, we observed that invaders have induced substantial changes to fish communities under influence of environmental filters. Our results support the hipothesis that aquaculture is a main driver of fish non-native fish introduction and native biodiversity loss in the neotropics. Â© 2021, sociedade brasileira de ictiologia.

The impacts of invasive alien species (ias) on the environment are well known, however, economic impacts are poorly estimated, especially in mega-diverse countries where both economic and ecological consequences of these effects can be catastrophic. Ecuador, one of the smallest mega-diverse countries, lacks a comprehensive description of the economic costs of ias within its territory. Here, using ""invacost"", a public database that compiles all recorded monetary costs associated with ias from english and non-english sources, we investigated the economic costs of biological invasions. We found that between 1983 and 2017, the reported costs associated with biological invasions ranged between us$86.17 million (when considering only the most robust data) and us$626 million (when including all cost data) belonging to 37 species and 27 genera. Furthermore, 99% of the recorded cost entries were from the galapagos islands. From only robust data, the costliest identified taxonomic group was feral goats (capra hircus; us$20 million), followed by aedes mosquitoes (us$2.14 million) while organisms like plant species from the genus rubus, a parasitic fly (philornis downsi), black rats (rattus rattus) and terrestrial gastropods (achatina fulica) represented less than us$2 million each. Costs of ""mixed-taxa"" (i.e. Plants and animals) represented the highest (61% of total robust costs; us$52.44 million). The most impacted activity sector was the national park authorities, which spent about us$84 million. Results from robust data also revealed that management expenditures were the major type of costs recorded in the galapagos islands; however, costs reported for medical losses related to aedes mosquitoes causing dengue fever in mainland ecuador would have ranked first if more detailed information had allowed us to categorize them as robust data. Over 70% of the ias reported for ecuador did not have reported costs. These results suggest that costs reported here are a massive underestimate of the actual economic toll of invasions in the country. Â© 2021 liliana ballesteros-mejia et al.

In most countries, available data on monetary costs of ias are scarce, while being crucial for developing efficient management. In this study, we use available data collected from the first global assessment of economic costs of ias (invacost) to quantify and describe the economic cost of invasions in mexico. This description was made across a range of taxonomic, sectoral and temporal variables, and allowed us to identify knowledge gaps within these areas. Overall, costs of invasions in mexico were estimated at us$ 5.33 billion (i.e., 109) ($mxn 100.84 billion) during the period from 1992 to 2019. Biological invasion costs were split relatively evenly between aquatic (us$ 1.16 billion; $mxn 21.95 billion) and terrestrial (us$ 1.17 billion; $mxn 22.14 billion) invaders, but semi-aquatic taxa dominated (us$ 2.99 billion; $mxn 56.57 billion), with costs from damages to resources four times higher than those from management of ias (us$ 4.29 billion vs. Us$ 1.04 billion; $mxn 81.17 billion vs $mxn 19.68 billion). The agriculture sector incurred the highest costs (us$ 1.01 billion; $mxn 19.1 billion), followed by fisheries (us$ 517.24 million; $mxn 9.79 billion), whilst most other costs simultaneously impacted mixed or unspecified sectors. When defined, costs to mexican natural protected areas were mostly associated with management actions in terrestrial environments, and were incurred through official authorities via monitoring, control or eradication. On natural protected islands, mainly mammals were managed (i.e. Rodents, cats and goats), to a total of us$ 3.99 million, while feral cows, fishes and plants were mostly managed in protected mainland areas, amounting to us$ 1.11 million in total. Pterygopli-chthys sp. And eichhornia crassipes caused the greatest reported costs in unprotected aquatic ecosystems in mexico, and bemisia tabaci to terrestrial systems. Although reported damages from invasions appeared to be fluctuating through time in mexico, management spending has been increasing.

Dimension reduction was done by three methods, namely the pearsonâs correlation, multi-collinearity analysis and principal component analysis (pca) to achieve the appropriate number of predictors. The study predicted the potential distribution of species by the 2050s and 2070s under representative concentrative pathways (rcps) rcp 4.5 and rcp 8.5 climate change scenarios using earth observations and maximum entropy (maxent) machine learning model. Results revealed that highly suitable areas for current distribution of axis porcinus cover 451.3 km2.

Neverthless, forest fragments still retain high levels of biological diversity. The haute matsiatra region (south-eastern madagascar) hosts the renowned andringitra national park and several surrounding isolated forest fragments embedded in a matrix of human-dominated landscape. During a herpetological survey conducted in the region, we visited a total of 25 sites. We applied a molecular taxonomic approach to identify the collected material and generate new reference sequences to improve the molecular identification of malagasy herpetofauna. We identified a total of 28 amphibian and 38 squamate taxa and provided a systematic account for each one of them. Nine of the identified taxa are candidate species, amongst which one was newly identified. We extended the known distributional range of 21 taxa (nine amphibians and 12 squamates). Although the largest forest fragments hold a higher number of species, we also detected a relatively high herpetological diversity in small patches. Our results highlight the importance of investigating small forest fragments to contribute to a better understanding of the patterns of diversity and distribution of the amphibians and reptiles of madagascar.

Salamandrivorans (bsal) cause infections that have become primary drivers of amphibian biodiversity loss. While globally widespread, the distribution margins of bd and bsal have not been determined, and the presence of these pathogens has probably gone unnoticed in many areas, especially in northern eurasia. To better understand the presence and distribution of both pathogens in the northern temperate and boreal forest biomes, 243 individuals were sampled from 8 native amphibian species across estonia. Additionally, 68 amphibians were sampled from captive collections in estonia and latvia. Pathogen infection was assessed using metabarcoding of the its2 marker. No positive matches for bsal infection were found. Bd was detected in 13 specimens, 3 of which were sampled at the riga zoo (with a prevalence of 5.2%) and 10 in natural environments in estonia (3.3%). The infected wild individuals belonged to 6 amphibian species and were detected throughout the mainland of estonia, but not on islands. Prevalence of infection with bd ranged between 3.1 and 12.5% among native species. In addition, we found molecular evidence for a potentially new sister species to bd in nature. Although outbreaks of chytridiomycosis have never been observed in estonia, it cannot be excluded that the dynamics of local amphibian populations are affected by bd infections. Therefore, further work, including capture-mark-recapture studies and long-term monitoring, are required to clarify the impact of bd on amphibians in northern europe. Â© 2021 inter-research.

This represents one of the principal causes of biodiversity loss in the world. Pangasianodon hypophthalmus is an introduced species in colombia that shares life characteristics and habitat with endangered native species, such as ageneiosus pardalis, sorubim cuspicaudus, and pseudoplatystoma magdaleniatum. However, its distribution is little-known, and scientists have barely explored the effects on the native fauna. Objectives: to evaluate the p. Hypophthalmus invasive potential in some of the colombian basins, which drain into the caribbean sea. Methods: using records available in various databases, we performed a niche conservatism analysis between the native and introduced records of p. Hypophthalmus using the r package ecospat. Subsequently, we modeled the potential invasion area of p. Hypophthalmus and the distribution areas of three native species, performing ecological niche modeling (enm) using the maxent algorithm. Finally, we calculated a geographic niche overlap between the non-native and native species. Results: the ecospat spatial analysis indicated that p. Hypophthalmus retains some environmental niche attributes through space. For this reason, we can use enm as an approximation to its range of distribution in the invaded area. Our results using enm demonstrated that the four species analyzed prefer low and slightly rocky regions; therefore, the geographical overlap of the three native speciesâ ecological niches and the introduced species exceed 80 %. Conclusions: there are adequate conditions in the study basins to fully establish the species p. Hypophthalmus, representing a high risk for aquatic ecosystems and native ichthyofauna. Knowledge of the potential distribution areas is essential to implement control of the species. Â© 2021, universidad de costa rica.

To inform endangered species conservation efforts, it is essential to improve our knowledge about the abiotic and biotic factors that influence bd infection dynamics in the wild. Here, we analyzed variation of bd infection in the redbelly toad melanophryniscus montevidensis, a threatened bufonid from uruguay. We tested the influence of temperature, precipitation, season, and host population size on bd prevalence and intensity. Additionally, considering the sublethal effects of bd, we tested if these variables, potentially through their effect on bd, also explain the variation in host body condition. We determined a high bd prevalence of 41% (100/241), and that population size influenced both bd prevalence and infection intensity. We identified an effect of precipitation and season on bd infection intensity and an effect of season on toad body condition. In addition, we found a negative effect of infection intensity on body condition; moreover, while some toads cleared the infection, their body condition did not improve, suggesting a longterm cost. This is the first report on host population size as an important factor in bd infection dynamics in a threatened anuran species, and seasonal demographic changes appear to play an important role in the dynamics. Finally, we highlight the need for monitoring bd in this and other endangered amphibian populations, especially those within the genus melanophryniscus, which includes several endangered and data deficient species in south america.

We investigated the effectiveness of the natura 2000 network in preserving the main wetlands of the two largest islands of the mediterranean region, whose conservation is critical for many avian species at european and global level, in a 23-year period (1990â2012). In sardinia, the surroundings of 22 wetlands were affected by an increase in artificial areas (+64 ha/year) and decrease in agricultural (â54 ha/year) and natural (â17 ha/year) ones. In sicily, the surroundings of 16 wetlands were impacted by an increase in agricultural areas (+50 ha/year) and decrease in natural and semi-natural ones (â62 ha/year). Results show that the natura 2000 policies were effective in preserving wetlands (no shrinkages detected in both regions), but their surroundings experienced intense processes of degradation and artificialization in all the sub-periods considered (1990â2000, 2000â2006, 2006â2012), whose effects are now threatening waterbirds and wetland integrity. The enlargement of the existing natura 2000 sites, the creation of new ones and the speedup of the application of the rules of the habitats and birds directives seem necessary to counteract the rapid land-use changes around these important stopover sites.

424,2021,"Article patterns of spatial overlap between non-indigenous and critically endangered freshwater fishes from a mediterranean biodiversity hotspotâ ","Diversity","Non-indigenous fish species (nifs) can cause severe ecological impacts on the invaded ecosystems and are considered as one of the leading factors of freshwater biodiversity loss. Unravel-ing the spatial overlap between nifs and critically endangered (cr) fish species can contribute to targeted conservation actions to minimize the potential negative effects. In this study, we applied geostatistical analyses to investigate the spatial overlap of nifs against fish species that are desig-nated under the cr status according to the iucn and the hellenic zoological society (hzs) red lists. Distributional data (presenceâabsence) from 800 records of 52 nifs were compiled for both lentic and lotic ecosystems of greece. Our results indicate that freshwater ecosystems under high nifs richness were located mainly in lowland areas and often near large cities and ecosystems with well-developed commercial and recreational fisheries. On the contrary, low nifs richness was ob-served in mountainous regions and in relatively small river basins. Overlapping areas of cr species with moderate to high nifs richness (1.5â4.3 nifs per 1 km2 ) were relatively high (~50%). A quarter of the overlapping areas (24.8%) fall within natura 2000 network, where legal management bodies could implement specialized programs to minimize the negative impacts. However, the majority of cr fish speciesâ distribution remains in unprotected areas indicating that protected areas should be re-designed to include areas containing freshwater species under the highest threatened category. Our findings demonstrate that whole assemblages of fishes are rapidly changing as nifs spread into greece and many freshwater ecosystems of outstanding biodiversity conservation value are under significant invasion pressure.

425,2021,"Species-area relationships induced by forest habitat fragmentation apply even to rarely detected organisms","Tropical Conservation Science","Neotropical snakes have extremely low detection rates, hampering our understanding of their responses to habitat loss and fragmentation. We addressed this gap using a limited sample (50 individuals, 16 species) across 25 variable-size insular forest fragments within a hydroelectric lake and four adjacent mainland continuous forest sites, in central brazilian amazonia. The number of species recorded on forest islands (1.55 (formula presented.) 0.78) was much lower than that at continuous forest sites (5.0 (formula presented.) 3.1), with no snakes being recorded at twelve islands smaller than 30 ha. As such, snake assemblages were positively affected by forest area, explaining 48% of the number of species, and negatively affected by island isolation. The markedly higher number of species recorded across continuous forest sites likely results from the availability of riparian habitats, which have virtually disappeared from the archipelagic landscape given the widespread inundation of lowland areas. To prevent further severe biodiversity loss, including those of poorly known rare taxa, conservation policies should avert the additional construction of mega-dams that create myriad of small islands, in addition to extensive reservoir lakes from which all riparian habitats are eliminated.

426,2021,"Guidelines for the rehabilitation, release, and post-release assessment of chacma baboons (papio ursinus) for reinforcement","Primate Conservation","There is a current global biodiversity loss at a rate 100 to 1000 times greater than the rate of natural extinction. Human activity, specifically human population growth and the necessary actions to sustain them, has led to habitat destruction, the rise of invasive species, climate change, and over exploitation of natural resources. In south africa, an increasing number of nonhuman primates have entered into rehabilitation centers due to animal-human conflicts. The high accumulation of these primates has led to an increase in the need for group formation and releases at rehabilitation centers. Although the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) has published generic guidelines for the release of nonhuman primates, it recommends species-specific guidelines be published for optimal release success. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of following best practice management approaches to maximize conservation efforts and individual welfare of displaced species, while also aiming to provide guidance on the best practice approaches. To date, there are only a few published species-specific rehabilitation and release protocols for primates. We, therefore, created species-specific guidelines for the rehabilitation of chacma baboons (papio ursinus) for reinforcement. The proposed guidelines are based on psychological well-being, social and individual behaviors, and the ecology of chacma baboons (papio ursinus) for rehabilitation, release, and post-release assessments. Our guidelines include seven distinct steps: arrival, conspecific resocialization, housing, training, and preparation, pre-release assessment, release-site selection, release, and post-release assessment. We provide detailed information and examples of each step based on the protocols from the riverside wildlife rehabilitation centre (riverside), a rehabilitation center in the limpopo province of south africa that has had successful rehabilitation and release projects for chacma baboons, among other primates. Since rehabilitation centers are limited by factors such as location and resources, this is meant to be a ""best practice"" model for this specific baboon species. The goal of these guidelines is to help assist future rehabilitation and releases, as well as provide a foundation to those who wish to modify the guidelines to create other speciesspecific rehabilitation steps.

427,2021,"Temperature and prey species richness drive the broad-scale distribution of a generalist predator","Diversity","The ongoing climate change and the unprecedented rate of biodiversity loss render the need to accurately project future species distributional patterns more critical than ever. Mounting evidence suggests that not only abiotic factors, but also biotic interactions drive broad-scale distributional patterns. Here, we explored the effect of predator-prey interaction on the predator distribution, using as target species the widespread and generalist grass snake (natrix natrix). We used ensemble species distribution modeling (sdm) to build a model only with abiotic variables (abiotic model) and a biotic one including prey species richness. Then we projected the future grass snake distribution using a modest emission scenario assuming an unhindered and no dispersal scenario. The two models performed equally well, with temperature and prey species richness emerging as the top drivers of species distribution in the abiotic and biotic models, respectively. In the future, a severe range contraction is anticipated in the case of no dispersal, a likely possibility as reptiles are poor dispersers. If the species can disperse freely, an improbable scenario due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it will lose part of its contemporary distribution, but it will expand northwards.

428,2021,"Elk conflict with beef and dairy producers poses wildlife management challenges in northern california","Ecology And Society","Large terrestrial wildlife negatively impacts agricultural livelihoods on all continents except antarctica. There is growing recognition of the need to reconcile these impacts to achieve socially and ecologically sustainable wildlife conservation agendas. Elk populations in northern california are estimated to have doubled in the past 35 years, marking a conservation success, but also increasing forage loss and damage to infrastructure on private land. Wildlife managers are pursuing the goal of increasing elk numbers on public lands, but elk are preferentially utilizing private pasture and rangeland, driving conflict with beef and dairy producers. We conducted 17 semistructured interviews with private landowners, primarily beef and dairy producers, in northern california to understand their experiences and reactions to elk conflict and state wildlife management. Landowners report that elk density on private rangeland has steadily increased in recent years and poses a threat to their businesses due to loss of forage, damage to fences, and the corresponding liability risk posed by breached fences and errant cattle. The absence of crop and forage loss compensation, difficulty obtaining depredation permits, and low harvest quotas for recreational hunting limit landowner mitigation options and foster resentment toward the state wildlife agency. Most landowners believe that current elk management policies, including restricted hunting opportunities, do not adequately address elk conflict, creating novel challenges for wildlife officials tasked with reconciling elk restoration goals with a variety of stakeholders experiencing economic losses and threats to rural livelihoods. We discuss these issues in the context of common wildlife management challenges, such as building social capital, defining tolerable impacts, and building institutional capacity for alternative solutions within rigid regulatory frameworks. We draw upon environmental economics and common-pool resource theory to suggest that a rethinking of elk management based on local conditions, facilitating damage compensation mechanisms while reducing transaction costs, and increasing participation of local stakeholders in decision making might improve outcomes.

A meta-analysis on the eurasian kestrel falco tinnunculus diet in the western paleartic was conducted using 59 studies published between 1935 and 2018 with a total sample of 84,778 prey items. Surprisingly, no differences were observed, on average, between diet compositions (% prey eaten and biomass ingested) between rural and unban areas. In contrast, geographical differences occur with more invertebrates and fewer mammals in mediterranean regions and few birds in northern regions, validating a latitudinal gradient in the diet of the kestrel, for prey species and biomass. Temporal variations occur significantly only in the southern part of the distribution while no clear trends were observed in northern part. Diet variations are discussed in the light of recent and massive decline of biodiversity and particularly of the potential main food sources of kestrels, i.e mammals, birds and invertebrates. Kestrels may probably respond to the loss of biodiversity in their breeding distribution range by reducing densities of breeding populations. Â© 2021 societe d'etudes ornithologiques.

430,2021,"Freshwater conservation planning in the far north of ontario, canada: identifying priority watersheds for the conservation of fish biodiversity in an intact boreal landscape","Facets","Freshwater ecosystems show more biodiversity loss than terrestrial or marine systems. We present a systematic conservation planning analysis in the arctic ocean drainage basin in ontario, canada, to identify key watersheds for the conservation of 30 native freshwater fish, including four focal species: lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, brook trout, and walleye. We created species distribution models for 30 native fish species and accounted for anthropogenic impacts. We used the âprioritizrâ package in r to select watersheds that maximize species targets, minimize impacts, and meet area-based targets based on the convention on biological diversity commitment to protect 17% of terrestrial and freshwater areas by 2020 and the proposed target to protect 30% by 2030. We found that, on average, 17.4% and 29.8% of predicted species distributions were represented for each of the 30 species in the 17% and 30% area-based solutions, respectively. The outcomes were more efficient when we prioritized for individual species, particularly brook trout, where 24% and 36% of its predicted distribution was represented in the 17% and 30% solutions, respectively. Future conservation planning should consider climate change, culturally significant species and areas, and the importance of first nations as guardians and stewards of the land in northern ontario.

432,2021,"Changes of bird community under urbanization and its relationship with urban vegetation","Shengtai Xuebao","There are more than half of the world's human population living in cities. The vast amount of predicted rapid urbanization in the coming years consuming habitats and reducing the possibilities for wildlife to thrive in cities, and is contributing to the loss of global biodiversity. Among them, birds are the most important part of urban ecosystem and a key target for urban biodiversity protection. Besides, it is also a research hotspot. The last 20 years of urban bird ecology research have experienced exponential growth and now enables literature analyses and reviews. Here, we try to roundup these present findings on urban bird communities research from all over the world, overviewing patterns and variation processes on urban bird community, especially the changes in composition and structure, spatial distribution, living habits and the way of breeding and nesting under this continuous and rapid urbanization. To further assess the importance of and contributions provided by urban green space and vegetation to the urban bird community, exploring its affecting mechanisms that support bird diversity in urban areas, we reviewed the published literature for such studies. The results showed that: 1) provision of greenery can ameliorate the hostility of the urban environment for wildlife, as well as provide suitable living space and food resources for urban birds. Green spaces provide the most important habitats for urban birds. 2) not all forms of greening benefit bird communities to the same extent. Compared to those areas that do not pay much attention to native plant protection, areas that retain natural or semi-natural cover and large trees can support richer bird species. 3) structure and coverage of vegetation have significant impacts on bird communities. The increasing canopy coverage, complex vertical structures and many kinds of plant species can produce various types of plant spaces and heterogenetic habitats. The increased plant spaces and habitats can cause changes in bird community composition, a correspondingly increase in species richness and diversity. In conclusion, maintaining and strengthening the healthy and stable of vegetation communities in cities is an effective strategy to conserve urban biodiversity. Collectively, protecting existing and planting new greenery has great potential to restraint urban biodiversity loss. Based on these, we propose the future research development direction of the relationship between the urban environment and bird communities. Further, the application prospects of this research in bird diversity protection to provide a more resilient, stable, and sustainable urban system are also pointed out. Â© 2021 science press.

433,2021,"Justification for a taxonomic conservation update of the rodent genus tamiasciurus: addressing marginalization and mis-prioritization of research efforts and conservation laissez-faire for a sustainability outlook","European Zoological Journal","Taxonomy presents itself as the critical basis of any modern scientific decision-making approach in the living world, and therefore accurate classifications have to be sought. Due to ongoing species naming debates, here we would like to facilitate a discussion on the methods and validity used for taxonomic claims and their influence on conservation, ecology, and management for squirrels in the western world as a wider example. Following the established epigenetic approach, we examine the rodent genus tamiasciurus. We include in our assessment all relevant species-interfering characteristics and present one new perspective, ecological niches. The ecological niche is essential for explaining the speciesâ behavior patterns and their discrepancies among the congeners, adding insights into phylogenesis. We add the usage of mapping software such as geographic information systems (arcgis, open qgis) for this genus, as well as best-available open access data and the statistical aid from r. Misclassifications in the taxonomy are known to lead to conservation failures on a continental and societal scale, in part caused by a lack of knowledge by the public and the miscommunication between scientists and the public. As one possible solution, here we suggest a reclassification for mearnsâs squirrel (tamiasciurus mearnsi) and a description update for the entire tamiasciurus genus to improve conservation success. Additional solutions are presented to simplify classification with reduced errors and confusion in the animal kingdom. A larger future effort of this style is sought to greatly decrease marginalization, to improve the current lack of research priority and âlaissez-faireâ attitudes on environmental issues for a better relationship between humans and the biotic world. In conclusion we present important topics and yet unaddressed problems, such as how the rodentâs marginalization influences the pandemic disease transmission to humans (e.g. Covid-19, rabies, and bubonic plague), appropriately assigned budgets for their conservation, and the data transparency in a continuously accelerating climate-changing world.

434,2021,"Decline in forest bird species and guilds due to land use change in the western himalaya","Global Ecology And Conservation","Land use change is the most widespread driver of biodiversity loss in densely populated tropical countries. Biodiversity loss, in turn, results in changes in functional guilds responsible for various forest ecosystem services. It is thus necessary to understand the extent and types of biodiversity loss and functional guild alteration caused by land use change in order to facilitate sustainable land use policies. Here we study the effects of land use change on forest bird species and guilds in a human-dominated landscape in the western himalaya, india. We carried out systematic breeding-season surveys in six land use types within moist temperate forest: natural (protected) oak forest, degraded (lightly used) oak forest, lopped (heavily used) oak forest, pine forest, cultivation and built-up sites, in two adjoining landscapes, over two consecutive years. Our study shows moderate to drastic species loss in all modified land use types in comparison to natural oak forest. Species composition in modified land use types diverged significantly from natural oak; this effect was highest in cultivation and built-up sites and least in degraded forests. Compositional change in modified land uses occurred due to partial replacement of forest specialists with commensals and open country species, whereas abundance of forest generalists was relatively constant across the gradient. We also find a steep decline in the abundance of functional guilds such as pollinators, and insectivorous pest controllers in all modified land uses in comparison to natural oak forest. Our results have important implications for conservation in biodiverse mountain landscapes with significant human imprint. In particular, (a) low faunal diversity in monocultures and urban sites (b) drastic (50% loss or more) loss of forest specialists, pollinators and insectivores in degraded forests, monocultures and urbanised sites; and (c) the potential for degraded forest as refugia for forest species, are findings that can be globally applied to land use and conservation planning in human-dominated landscapes.

435,2021,"Global conservation status of the world's most prominent forage fishes (teleostei: clupeiformes)","Biological Conservation","Understanding the extinction risk of taxonomic groups increases our ability to prioritize efforts to address biodiversity loss. Over 400 species of herrings, shads, sardines, anchovies, menhadens, and relatives belong to the order clupeiformes and include many of the most important forage fishes. These small, schooling fishes are ecologically, economically, and culturally significant. However, despite their global contribution to fisheries and our increasing reliance on them for food and modern commodities, we lack critical information regarding basic biology and population trends for most species. We applied the iucn red list methodology, a comprehensive and systematic approach to assess extinction risk, to all clupeiform species. The best estimate suggests nearly 11% of species are of elevated conservation concern, although this could be as high as 36%. Two regions, the caribbean and the indo-malay-philippine archipelago have high concentrations of threatened and data deficient species and are areas of conservation concern. Major threats include overexploitation, pollution, and habitat modification. Immediate conservation priorities include: 1) increasing research and mitigative action directed toward species assessed as threatened or data deficient; 2) improving fisheries management regulations for the understudied but heavily exploited species, and 3) promoting local, intensive habitat restoration to reduce pollution and remove dams. These extinction risk assessments and subsequent analyses should be used as an informative tool for fisheries and conservation managers and to monitor conservation progress.

436,2021,"Effects of habitat restoration on peatland bird communities","Restoration Ecology","Restoration of damaged ecosystems has become an important tool to slow down biodiversity loss and to maintain ecosystem services. Peatland bird populations have shown a substantial decline during the recent decades in northern europe as a consequence of peatland drainage. We studied whether restoration of peatlands drained for forestry affects bird communities. We conducted bird surveys at 11 peatlands in western finland, where each of the restored and their pristine counterparts were surveyed before restoration and yearly after restoration during 2010â2018. We used linear mixed effect models to analyze whether restoration affected the number of species and territories of peatland specialist and non-specialist species and permutational multivariate analysis of variance to analyze the change in community composition. Drained parts of the peatlands had higher number of territories of non-specialist species before restoration, and restoration seemed to decrease these numbers towards the level of pristine parts. By contrast, restoration did not affect the number of peatland specialists and their territories, which was lower in drained than in pristine parts of the peatlands. Bird communities in restored parts remained different from pristine parts in terms of community composition after restoration. Thus, despite the effect of restoration on non-specialists, a substantially long time may be required for a recovery of the peatland bird communities. Based on our results, it seems that long-term monitoring of the restored and pristine peatlands is needed to determine whether restoration is effective in recovering the peatland specialist bird species and bird communities in general.

437,2021,"Status of aquatic and riparian biodiversity in artificial lake ecosystems with and without management for recreational fisheries: implications for conservation","Aquatic Conservation: Marine And Freshwater Ecosystems","Humanity is facing a biodiversity crisis, with freshwater-associated biodiversity in a particularly dire state. Novel ecosystems created through human use of mineral resources, such as gravel pit lakes, can provide substitute habitats for the conservation of freshwater and riparian biodiversity. Many of these artificial ecosystems are subject to a high intensity of recreational use, however, which may limit their biodiversity potential. The species richness of several taxa (plants, amphibians, dragonflies, damselflies, waterfowl, and songbirds) was assessed and a range of taxonomic biodiversity metrics were compared between gravel pit lakes managed for recreational fisheries (n = 16) and unmanaged reference lakes (n = 10), controlling for non-fishing-related environmental variation. The average species richness of all the taxa examined was similar among lakes in both lake types and no substantial differences in species composition were found when examining the pooled species inventory. Similarly, there were no differences between lake types in the presence of rare species and in the simpson diversity index across all of the taxa assessed. Variation in species richness among lakes was correlated with woody habitat, lake morphology (surface area and steepness), and land use, but was not correlated with the presence of recreational fisheries. Thus, non-fishing-related environmental variables had stronger effects on local species presence than recreational fisheries management or the presence of recreational anglers. Collectively, no evidence was found that anglers and recreational fisheries management constrain the development of aquatic and riparian biodiversity in gravel pit lakes in the study region; however, the conservation of species diversity in gravel pit lakes could benefit from an increasing reliance on habitat enhancement activities.

438,2021,"Impacts of rodent eradication on seed predation and plant community biomass on a tropical atoll","Biotropica","Invasive rodent eradications are frequently undertaken to curb island biodiversity loss. However, the breadth of rodentsâ ecological impact, even after eradication, is not always fully recognized. For example, the most widespread invasive rodent, the black rat (rattus rattus), while omnivorous, eats predominantly seeds and fruit. Yet, the effects of seed predation release after eradication on plant communities and ecological functions are not well understood, posing a gap for island restoration. We examined the role of seed predation release following black rat eradication in changes to tree composition and aboveground biomass across an islet network (palmyra atoll) in the central pacific. We conducted repeated surveys of seed, juvenile, and adult tree biomass and survival in permanent vegetation plots before and after the eradication of rats. We observed a 95% reduction in seed predation for an introduced, previously cultivated tree population (cocos nucifera). Juvenile tree biomass of all species increased 14-fold, with c.â nucifera increasing the most, suggesting that eradication increased this tree's competitive advantage. Indeed, based on stage-structured demographic models, rat eradication led to a 10% increase in c.â nucifera population growth rate. The effect of invasive rodent seed predation varies considerably among the plant species in a community and can shift competitive dynamics, sometimes in favor of invasive plants. These bottom-up effects should be considered in evaluating the costs and benefits of eradication. Documenting the variation in invasive rodent diet items, along with long-term surveys, can help prioritize island eradications where restoration is most likely to be successful.

439,2021,"Habitat fragmentation differentially shapes neutral and immune gene variation in a tropical bird species","Heredity","Habitat fragmentation is a major cause of biodiversity loss, responsible for an alteration of intraspecific patterns of neutral genetic diversity and structure. Although neutral genetic variation can be informative for demographic inferences, it may be a poor predictor of adaptive genetic diversity and thus of the consequences of habitat fragmentation on selective evolutionary processes. In this context, we contrasted patterns of genetic diversity and structure of neutral loci (microsatellites) and immune genes (i.e., toll-like receptors) in an understorey bird species, the wedge-billed woodcreeper glyphorynchus spirurus. The objectives were (1) to investigate forest fragmentation effects on population genetic diversity, (2) to disentangle the relative role of demography (genetic drift and migration) and selection, and (3) to assess whether immunogenetic patterns could be associated with variation of ectoparasite (i.e., ticks) pressures. Our results revealed an erosion of neutral genetic diversity and a substantial genetic differentiation among fragmented populations, resulting from a decrease in landscape connectivity and leading to the divergence of distinct genetic pools at a small spatial scale. Patterns of genetic diversity observed for tlr4 and tlr5 were concordant with neutral genetic patterns, whereas those observed for tlr3 and tlr21 were discordant. This result underlines that the dominant evolutionary force shaping immunogenetic diversity (genetic drift vs. Selection) may be different depending on loci considered.

440,2021,"Bird diversity and endemism along a land-use gradient in madagascar: the conservation value of vanilla agroforests","Biotropica","Land-use change is the most important driver of biodiversity loss worldwide and particularly so in the tropics, where natural habitats are transformed into large-scale monocultures or heterogeneous landscape mosaics of largely unknown conservation value. Using birds as an indicator taxon, we evaluated the conservation value of a landscape mosaic in northeastern madagascar, a biodiversity hotspot and the center of global vanilla production. We assessed bird species richness and composition by conducting point counts across seven prevalent land-use types (forest- and fallow-derived vanilla agroforests, woody and herbaceous fallow that are part of a shifting cultivation system, rice paddy, forest fragment and contiguous old-growth forest). We find that old-growth forest had the highest species richness, driven by a high share of endemics. Species richness and community composition in forest-derived vanilla agroforest were similar to forest fragment, whereas fallow-derived vanilla agroforest was most comparable to woody fallow. The open land-use types herbaceous fallow and rice paddy had fewest species. Across forest fragments, vanilla agroforests, and woody fallows, endemic bird species richness was positively correlated to landscape-scale forest cover. We conclude that both fallow- and forest-derived vanilla agroforests play an important but contrasting role for bird conservation: fallow-derived agroforests are less valuable but take fallow land out of the shifting cultivation cycle, possibly preventing further degradation. Conversely, forest-derived agroforests contribute to forest degradation but may avoid total loss of tree cover from forest fragments. Considering the land-use history of agroforests may thus be a promising avenue for future research beyond the case of vanilla. Abstract in malagasay is available with online material.

441,2021,"Scientistsâ warning to humanity on the freshwater biodiversity crisis","Ambio","Freshwater ecosystems provide irreplaceable services for both nature and society. The quality and quantity of freshwater affect biogeochemical processes and ecological dynamics that determine biodiversity, ecosystem productivity, and human health and welfare at local, regional and global scales. Freshwater ecosystems and their associated riparian habitats are amongst the most biologically diverse on earth, and have inestimable economic, health, cultural, scientific and educational values. Yet human impacts to lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands and groundwater are dramatically reducing biodiversity and robbing critical natural resources and services from current and future generations. Freshwater biodiversity is declining rapidly on every continent and in every major river basin on earth, and this degradation is occurring more rapidly than in terrestrial ecosystems. Currently, about one third of all global freshwater discharges pass through human agricultural, industrial or urban infrastructure. About one fifth of the earthâs arable land is now already equipped for irrigation, including all the most productive lands, and this proportion is projected to surpass one third by midcentury to feed the rapidly expanding populations of humans and commensal species, especially poultry and ruminant livestock. Less than one fifth of the worldâs preindustrial freshwater wetlands remain, and this proportion is projected to decline to under one tenth by midcentury, with imminent threats from water transfer megaprojects in brazil and india, and coastal wetland drainage megaprojects in china. The living planet index for freshwater vertebrate populations has declined to just one third that of 1970, and is projected to sink below one fifth by midcentury. A linear model of global economic expansion yields the chilling prediction that human utilization of critical freshwater resources will approach one half of the earthâs total capacity by midcentury. Although the magnitude and growth of the human freshwater footprint are greater than is generally understood by policy makers, the news media, or the general public, slowing and reversing dramatic losses of freshwater species and ecosystems is still possible. We recommend a set of urgent policy actions that promote clean water, conserve watershed services, and restore freshwater ecosystems and their vital services. Effective management of freshwater resources and ecosystems must be ranked amongst humanityâs highest priorities.

442,2020,"Unusually paced life history strategies of marine megafauna drive atypical sensitivities to environmental variability","Frontiers In Marine Science","Understanding why different life history strategies respond differently to changes in environmental variability is necessary to be able to predict eco-evolutionary population responses to change. Marine megafauna display unusual combinations of life history traits. For example, rays, sharks and turtles are all long-lived, characteristic of slow life histories. However, turtles also have very high reproduction rates and juvenile mortality, characteristic of fast life histories. Sharks and rays, in contrast, produce a few live-born young, which have low mortality rates, characteristic of slow life histories. This raises the question if marine megafaunal responses to environmental variability follow conventional life history patterns, including the pattern that fast life histories are more sensitive to environmental autocorrelation than slow life histories. To answer this question, we used a functional trait approach to quantify for different species of mobulid rays, cheloniid sea turtles and carcharhinid sharks â all inhabitants or visitors of (human-dominated) coastalscapes â how their life history, average size and log stochastic population growth rate, log(îs), respond to changes in environmental autocorrelation and in the frequency of favorable environmental conditions. The faster life histories were more sensitive to temporal frequency of favourable environmental conditions, but both faster and slower life histories were equally sensitive, although of opposite sign, to environmental autocorrelation. These patterns are atypical, likely following from the unusual life history traits that the megafauna display, as responses were linked to variation in mortality, growth and reproduction rates. Our findings signify the importance of understanding how life history traits and population responses to environmental change are linked. Such understanding is a basis for accurate predictions of marine megafauna population responses to environmental perturbations like (over)fishing, and to shifts in the autocorrelation of environmental variables, ultimately contributing toward bending the curve on marine biodiversity loss.

443,2020,"The future of food from the sea","Nature","Global food demand is rising, and serious questions remain about whether supply can increase sustainably1. Land-based expansion is possible but may exacerbate climate change and biodiversity loss, and compromise the delivery of other ecosystem services2â6. As food from the sea represents only 17% of the current production of edible meat, we ask how much food we can expect the ocean to sustainably produce by 2050. Here we examine the main food-producing sectors in the oceanâwild fisheries, finfish mariculture and bivalve maricultureâto estimate âsustainable supply curvesâ that account for ecological, economic, regulatory and technological constraints. We overlay these supply curves with demand scenarios to estimate future seafood production. We find that under our estimated demand shifts and supply scenarios (which account for policy reform and technology improvements), edible food from the sea could increase by 21â44â million tonnes by 2050, a 36â74% increase compared to current yields. This represents 12â25% of the estimated increase in all meat needed to feed 9.8â billion people by 2050. Increases in all three sectors are likely, but are most pronounced for mariculture. Whether these production potentials are realized sustainablyâ will depend on factors such as policy reforms, technological innovation and the extent of future shifts in demand.

444,2020,"From tigers to axolotls: why people keep exotic pets in russia","People And Nature","The exotic pet trade, both legal and illegal, â¬plays a crucial role in wildlife overharvesting and biodiversity loss world-wide, but drivers of demand for exotic pets are still poorly understood and under-studied. Some geographical areas, including the post-soviet states, have little or no relevant research. We conducted open-ended in-depth interviews with 27 exotic pet owners in russia. The research involved participants who collectively owned over 90 pet animals, including endangered and critically endangered species. The interviewees were classified into four main categories according to their motivations and reasons for keeping exotic pets. âlife-saversâ were motivated by pity; âaccidental ownersâ acquired animals by chance; ânew experience seekersâ were looking for something different and unusual; and âcollectorsâ acquired animals based on their specific characteristics. Species and provenance preferences, level of husbandry knowledge, understanding of the legislation and rights varied among exotic pet owners often reflecting their different motivations. Despite their differences, together they formed a distinctive sub-community of pet owners. Our findings provide essential information for various stakeholders, including policymakers and law enforcement agencies, aiming to address exotic pet trade in russia and its negative impact on biodiversity both in russia and overseas. Understanding the motivations for exotic pet ownership will facilitate a more evidence-based policy to emerge to regulate pet ownership. This paper can also serve as a basis for further investigation into the exotic pet trade of russia and our typology of motivations could be a basis for future studies in other geographical areas.

445,2020,"No evidence of an extinction of experience or emotional disconnect from nature in urban singapore","People And Nature","It is widely believed that people living in cities have fewer and poorer daily experiences of nature, and that this contributes to the biodiversity crisis on the basis that if people do not know nature, they will not care for its conservation. In 1978, pyle coined the term âextinction of experienceâ to reflect the loss of opportunities to experience nature as urbanization progresses. However, evidence of an emotional disconnect from nature arising from an extinction of experience remains poorly documented. Here we repeat a study conducted in 1996 comprising household surveys and bird surveys in a neighbourhood of singapore, one of the world's most densely populated cities. We investigate empirically whether experiences of nature, opportunities to experience nature and the emotional connection between people and nature have changed across 22â years. We discover that emotional connection with nature has actually increased among greenspace users and non-users, while the frequency and duration of greenspace visits remained unchanged. Among greenspace users, the number of different nature elements experienced also remained unchanged and more frequent users demonstrated a stronger emotional connection with nature. We further found an increase in opportunities to experience local nature, as measured by bird species richness and abundance. While we found no evidence for an extinction of experience or an emotional disconnect from nature in this particular setting and timeframe in urban singapore, similar studies elsewhere are necessary to explore whether there may be geographical, cultural or temporal variations.

Protecting large extensions of pristine forest is essential to prevent biodiversity loss, but evaluating the potential of anthropogenic areas in maintaining biodiversity is important in highly fragmented landscapes. Here, we studied the avifauna of paranã ssf in several habitats (re, pristine forest considered as reference sites; lf, large forest fragments; mf, middle-sized forest fragments; sf, small forest fragments; uf, urban forest fragments; af, agricultural fields; ra, reforestation areas) aiming to investigate which are the most vulnerable species in this vegetation type. In order to do so, we categorized each species according to habitat specialization, level of threat, and level of sensitivity to forest fragmentation. We also measured the similarity in bird species composition among six habitat categories with different types of anthropogenic disturbance (lf, mf, sf, uf, af, and ra). We recorded 368 terrestrial bird species, of which 41 were considered to be vulnerable due to being forest specialist birds that were also sensitive and/or threatened. Sensitive and/or threatened species were rarely found in uf, af, and ra (1â3 species). Therefore, large forests such as re are of vital importance to bird species conservation. The similarity in bird species composition among lf, mf, and sf indicates that general ecological functions of birds could be similar in these habitats, suggesting that the conservation of forest fragments is important for the maintenance of bird community functionality in the present paranã ssf.

This study aims to examine the global illegal ivory trades, identify key hub countries and map the key smuggling routes in the worldwide illegal ivory trading network. A social network analysis (sna) and a set of network indicators are used to investigate citesâs (convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora) ivory trading data from 1975 to 2017. Several important conclusions are derived: (1) the social network of global ivory trading is closely connected, with an average path length of 2.643 and an average clustering coefficient of 0.463. An average of 45,410.384â kg of ivory products was trafficked from each of the 182 countries to an average of another 8.17 countries. The dynamic networks of global ivory trading show the pattern of high connectivity and high aggregation. (2) the usa, the uk, zimbabwe, south africa, china, japan, sudan, belgium and hong kong are the most important hubs in the worldwide ivory trade according to degrees and centralities in the sna. (3) according to trading weight density, three significant ivory trafficking routes are illustrated: 1. African countries (sudan, zimbabwe, south africa, central african republic, the republic of congo, somalia and uganda) to hong kong; 2. Belgium to hong kong and japan; 3. Mutual transactions between japan and hong kong. The analytical framework in this study can also be useful for studying other illegal trading activities, like other animal trades, with respect to biodiversity conversation, and could serve as a reference for other network-based sustainability challenges, such as human migration, biological invasion, and waste smuggling and dumping.

448,2020,"Trading tactics: time to rethink the global trade in wildlife","Animals","The covid-19 outbreak has brought about fresh and intensified scrutiny of the wildlife trade, which substantively involves commerce in exotic pets. In response, major policy decisions involving trade bans have ensued, with calls for similar such action to be applied across the trade chain. Yet, these measures have been criticised, largely based on concerns that they risk exacerbating poverty, undermining human rights, damaging conservation incentives, and otherwise harming sustainable development and conservation efforts. Instead, many critics propose improved regulation of the status quo, with the intention of nurturing a legal, sustainable, safe, humane, and equitable wildlife trade. Herein, we provide a countering view that outlines how the risks presented by the wildlife trade are becoming increasingly recognised as being both manifold and severe; and raise concerns that the goal of a well-regulated wildlife trade is becoming increasingly exposed as a mirage. We conclude that while pursuing the united nationâs sustainable development goals (with their focus on poverty alleviation, food security, public health, and conservation) is enduringly vital, a flourishing wildlife trade is not. Given that the exploitation of wildlife, including for the pet trade, has been identified as one of the dominant drivers of biodiversity loss, emergence of zoonotic infectious disease, animal suffering, and financial instability, perpetuating the concept of utilising a regulated wildlife trade as the default approach to protect people and planet is in urgent need of re-evaluation.

To maintain biodiversity, we need to understand how current management practices influence forest ecosystems. We studied the effects of forest successional stage and management intensity on the abundance, species richness, and assemblage composition of small mammals. Our results show that management intensity significantly contributes to reducing the number of species after clearcutting. We revealed that intensively managed clearings can make the dispersal or foraging activity of small mammals difficult and hence negatively influence their abundance and species richness. The significantly higher species richness of small mammal species was recorded within more extensively rather than intensively managed clearings. In contrast, we did not observe significant changes in species richness and abundance after intensive management in old-growth forests. Species clethrionomys glareolus and apodemus flavicollis reached the greatest abundance in old-growth forest patches. On the other hand, microtus arvalis and microtus subterraneus were species mainly associated with the successionally youngest forest stands. Our analysis suggests that intensive management interventions (i.e., vegetation destruction by pesticides and wood debris removal by soil milling) in clearings produce unhostile environments for majority of the small mammal species.

This, however, can prove difficult for data-limited species. Focusing on the little-studied mainland clouded leopard (neofelis nebulosa), a potential umbrella species in the region, we demonstrate an accessible, flexible, and scalable approach applicable to any species. First, we model the speciesâ range-wide local extirpation threat using a bayesian belief network, taking into account the distribution of remaining suitable habitat and major anthropogenic threats (habitat loss and poaching). We then identify remaining habitat strongholds (defined as large contiguous areas of high quality habitat where the species could survive over the mid-to-long term) and grouped them into stronghold complexes, which we categorized based on local extirpation threat and recent camera-trap survey status. Our results show a 34% decline in the range-wide area categorized as a stronghold due to forest cover changes between 2000 and 2018, with 80% of remaining strongholds identified as having a high or very high average threat of local extirpation. Based on published records, only 60% of remaining strongholds had at least one site surveyed by camera-traps in the last 10 years, highlighting an important knowledge gap concerning the speciesâ current distribution and population status. Combined, the results of our survey review and threat analysis suggest the species is likely extirpated from all of vietnam, most of china, and large parts of cambodia and laos. Finally, we synthesize our findings, highlight tangible conservation needs, and propose actions for each stronghold complex based on the area's specific threats, protection level, and survey status, paving the way for the detailed local investigations needed to implement meaningful interventions on the ground.

451,2020,"Custodianship of wildlife on private land to support conservation-an australian model","Rangeland Journal","A large proportion of the world's extinctions have occurred in australia, and threatened species lists continue to grow, notwithstanding government and philanthropic efforts. Most losses have been on private land, so relying on national parks and reserves is not enough to reverse trends and meet australia's responsibilities. This paper proposes a model that could increase abundance and distribution of australia's biodiversity, while providing financial incentives to private landholders to do so. It addresses the question, can landholder management of wildlife, and a form of private ownership, remedy shortfalls in government funding for biodiversity conservation and the resulting consequences of vast biodiversity losses? Landholders currently invest in propagating introduced livestock species, but they are prevented by current regulations from investing in a similar manner in threatened australian native species. Market-based incentives could increase the distribution and abundance of species on private land and help protect the habitat of other biodiversity. The enabling changes would be contentious to some people but are consistent with the international union for the conservation of nature's sustainable use policy. Different versions of wildlife privatisation have been successfully applied internationally: there is urgency for australia to draw on these experiences and develop its own model to encourage and support wildlife on private freehold land. The model proposed in this paper focuses on: identifying locally overabundant populations or captive-bred populations as sources of supply finding landholders and philanthropists who would like to have custodianship of species; enabling entrepreneurs to respond to demand and bringing the two together where there is scope for a market-based sharing economy. Encouraging wildlife custodianship on private freehold land would be mutually beneficial, as it would not only result in an increase in biodiversity, but the economic value of wildlife could provide an income to landholders as well as enhancing australia's conservation system.

Developing robust multi-species conservation models is critical for stemming biodiversity loss both here and globally. We used a large and geographically extensive remote-camera survey and multi-scale, multivariate optimization species distribution modelling to investigate the factors driving biodiversity across these two adjoining biodiversity hotspots. Four major findings emerged from the work. (I) we identified clear spatial patterns of species richness, with two main biodiverse centres in the thai-malay peninsula and in the mountainous region of southwest china. (Ii) carnivores in particular, and large ungulates to a lesser degree, were the strongest indicators of species richness. (Iii) climate had the largest effect on biodiversity, followed by protected status and human footprint. (Iv) gap analysis between the biodiversity model and the current system of protected areas revealed that the majority of areas supporting the highest predicted biodiversity are not protected. Our results highlighted several key locations that should be prioritized for expanding the protected area network to maximize conservation effectiveness. We demonstrated the importance of switching from single-species to multi-species approaches to highlight areas of high priority for biodiversity conservation. In addition, since these areas mostly occur over multiple countries, we also advocate for a paradigmatic focus on transboundary conservation planning.

453,2020,"Biotic interactions govern the distribution of coexisting ungulates in the arctic archipelago â a case for conservation planning","Global Ecology And Conservation","Climate change and biodiversity loss underscore the need for conservation planning, even in remote areas. Species distribution models (sdms) can help identify critical habitat for reserve design and selection, and have quickly advanced to the fore of ecological inquiry. Such models are typically dominated by abiotic factors, following the eltonian noise hypothesis (enh) that physical features set the limits of species distributions. Nevertheless, recent studies challenge this notion and highlight the importance of biotic interactions. Resolving this discrepancy could have significant implications for conservation and ecological understanding. To test these ideas, we built distribution models for two large herbivores, muskoxen (ovibos muschatus) and peary caribou (rangifer tarandus pearyi), systematically observed across a vast spatial extent â 65 islands spanning 800,000 km2 in the canadian high arctic. To test the enh we fit sdms with two sets of predictors: (1) abiotic only (i.e. Topographic, climatic) and (2) abiotic + biotic (i.e. Vegetation communities, distance-to-heterospecifics). We evaluated these models and spatially estimated habitat suitability for each species. We found both sets of models had good predictive ability, although biotic variables (i.e. Proportion of grass-lichen-moss) improved model performance and substantially narrowed areas of high habitat suitability. Niche overlap between caribou and muskoxen was moderate and highly suitable areas were spatially disjunct between species and largely outside protected areas. These results fail to support the enh. Our study implies that biotic features, although often overlooked, may be important to the performance of sdms and vital in identifying priority areas for conservation. For these large herbivores, reflecting trophic interactions in sdms was essential when estimating areas of conservation value. Our approach helps prepare the way for improved projections regarding the prospects for wildlife while laying the foundation for biologically relevant protected areas.

Over 60% of north american grassland and aridlands have been lost since the 1800s. Birds in these habitats are among the most imperilled in north america, yet most remaining habitats are unprotected. Despite the need to measure impact, conservation efforts on private and working lands are rarely evaluated, due in part to limited availability of suitable methods. Location: northern great plains of north america. Methods: we developed a novel metric to evaluate grassland and aridland bird community response to habitat management, the bird-friendliness index (bfi), consisting of density estimates of grassland and aridland birds weighted by conservation need and a functional diversity metric to incorporate resiliency. We used the bfi to identify ecologically significant areas for grassland and aridland birds and compared them with other prioritizations. Then, we used the bfi to evaluate the effects of simulated habitat management on grassland and aridland bird communities. Results: the most resilient bird communities were found in the prairie potholes region of alberta, saskatchewan and north dakota and the lowest bfi values in the southern and western regions of the northern great plains. Bfi values were significantly greater in areas included in one or more prioritization, and increased with the number of prioritizations an area was included within. Bfi values increased in response to simulated bird-friendly habitat management. Main conclusions: our findings suggest that practices recommended for use in bird-friendly grassland habitat management plans will increase the abundance and resilience of the grassland and aridland bird community and that bird community responses to management will be detected using the bfi. The bfi is a tool by which conservationists and managers can carry out adaptive management and accountable conservation now and into the future. Â© 2020 the authors.

All but one of the 22 species are small ( 50% probability of extinction in the next â¼20 years. Collectively, the biggest factor contributing to the likelihood of extinction of the freshwater fishes considered is that they occur in small (distributions â¤44 km2), geographically isolated populations, and are threatened by a mix of processes (particularly alien fishes and climate change). Nineteen of these species are unlisted on national legislation, so legislative drivers for recovery actions are largely absent.

Three quarters of this trade is in species that are not covered by international trade regulation. These species include numerous endangered or range-restricted species, especially hotspots within asia. Approximately 90% of traded reptile species and half of traded individuals are captured from the wild. Exploitation can occur immediately after scientific description, leaving new endemic species especially vulnerable. Pronounced gaps in regulation imply trade is having unknown impacts on numerous threatened species. Gaps in monitoring demand a reconsideration of international reptile trade regulations. We suggest reversing the status-quo, requiring proof of sustainability before trade is permitted.

457,2020,"Recent and rapid anthropogenic habitat fragmentation increases extinction risk for freshwater biodiversity","Evolutionary Applications","Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation is often implicated as driving the current global extinction crisis, particularly in freshwater ecosystems. The genetic signal of recent population isolation can be confounded by the complex spatial arrangement of dendritic river systems. Consequently, many populations may presently be managed separately based on an incorrect assumption that they have evolved in isolation. Integrating landscape genomics data with models of connectivity that account for landscape structure, we show that the cumulative effects of multiple in-stream barriers have contributed to the recent decline of a freshwater fish from the murrayâdarling basin, australia. In addition, individual-based eco-evolutionary simulations further demonstrate that contemporary inferences about population isolation are consistent with the 160-year time frame since construction of in-stream barriers began in the region. Our findings suggest that the impact of very recent fragmentation may be often underestimated for freshwater biodiversity. We argue that proactive conservation measures to reconnect many riverine populations are urgently needed. Â© 2020 the authors.

458,2020,"Loss of protozoan and metazoan intestinal symbiont biodiversity in wild primates living in unprotected forests","Scientific Reports","In light of the current biodiversity crisis, investigating the human impact on non-human primate gut biology is important to understanding the ecological significance of gut community dynamics across changing habitats and its role in conservation. Using traditional coproscopic parasitological techniques, we compared the gastrointestinal protozoan and metazoan symbiont richness of two primates: the udzungwa red colobus (procolobus gordonorum) and the yellow baboon (papio cynocephalus). These species live sympatrically in both protected and unprotected forests within the udzungwa mountains of tanzania with distinct ecological adaptations and diets. Our results showed that terrestrial and omnivorous yellow baboons had 2 (95% ci 1.47â2.73) and 3.78 (2.62â5.46) times higher gut symbiont richness (both including and excluding rare protozoans) compared to the arboreal and leaf-eating udzungwa red colobus in unprotected and protected forest, respectively. We also found a consistent depletion of symbiont richness in red colobus living in the unprotected forest fragment compared to the continuous protected forests [the latter having 1.97 times (95% ci 1.33â2.92) higher richness], but not in yellow baboons. Richness reduction was particularly evident in the udzungwa red colobus monkeys, confirming the pattern we reported previously for gut bacterial communities. This study demonstrates the impact of human activities even on the microbiodiversity of the intestinal tract of this species. Against the background of rapid global change and habitat degradation, and given the health benefits of intact gut communities, the decrease in natural gut symbionts reported here is worrying. Further study of these communities should form an essential part of the conservation framework.

459,2020,"Assessing the effectiveness of a national protected area network for carnivore conservation","Nature Communications","Protected areas (pas) are essential to prevent further biodiversity loss yet their effectiveness varies largely with governance and external threats. Although methodological advances have permitted assessments of pa effectiveness in mitigating deforestation, we still lack similar studies for the impact of pas on wildlife populations. Here we use an innovative combination of matching methods and hurdle-mixed models with a large-scale and long-term dataset for finlandâs large carnivore species. We show that the national pa network does not support higher densities than non-protected habitat for 3 of the 4 species investigated. For some species, pa effects interact with region or time, i.e., wolverine densities decreased inside pas over the study period and lynx densities increased inside eastern pas. We support the application of matching methods in combination of additional analytical frameworks for deeper understanding of conservation impacts on wildlife populations. These methodological advances are crucial for preparing ambitious pa targets post-2020.

460,2020,"Stress and immunity: field comparisons among populations of invasive cane toads in florida","Journal Of Experimental Zoology Part A: Ecological And Integrative Physiology","Cane toads (rhinella marina) were introduced worldwide and have become invasive in multiple locations, representing a major driver of biodiversity loss through competition (food, shelter, territory), predation, and the poisoning of native species. These toads have been used in australia as a model for studies concerning invasion biology and ecoimmunology, as longer-established (core) and invasion front (edge) populations show altered stress and immune response profiles. Although cane toads were also introduced into the united states in the 1950s, these patterns have yet to be evaluated for the populations spanning florida. Toads introduced into florida have dispersed primarily northward along a latitudinal gradient, where they encounter cooler temperatures that may further impact stress and immune differences between core and edge populations. In this study, we sampled cane toads from nine different locations spanning their invasion in florida. Cane toads from southern populations showed higher plasma bacterial killing ability and natural antibody titers than the toads from the northern populations, indicating they have a better immune surveillance system. Also, southern toads were more responsive to a novel stressor (1 hr restraint), showing a higher increase in corticosterone levels. These results indicate that possible trade-offs have occurred between immune and stress responses as these toads have become established in northern cooler areas in florida.

461,2020,"Influences of landscape change and winter severity on invasive ungulate persistence in the nearctic boreal forest","Scientific Reports","Climate and landscape change are drivers of species range shifts and biodiversity loss; understanding how they facilitate and sustain invasions has been empirically challenging. Winter severity is decreasing with climate change and is a predicted mechanism of contemporary and future range shifts. For example, white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) expansion is a continental phenomenon across the nearctic with ecological consequences for entire biotic communities. We capitalized on recent temporal variation in winter severity to examine spatial and temporal dynamics of invasive deer distribution in the nearctic boreal forest. We hypothesized deer distribution would decrease in severe winters reflecting historical climate constraints, and remain more static in moderate winters reflecting recent climate. Further, we predicted that regardless of winter severity, deer distribution would persist and be best explained by early seral forage subsidies from extensive landscape change via resource extraction. We applied dynamic occupancy models in time, and species distribution models in space, to data from 62 camera traps sampled over 3 years in northeastern alberta, canada. Deer distribution shrank more markedly in severe winters but rebounded each spring regardless of winter severity. Deer distribution was best explained by anthropogenic landscape features assumed to provide early seral vegetation subsidy, accounting for natural landcover. We conclude that deer dynamics in the northern boreal forest are influenced both by landscape change across space and winter severity through time, the latter expected to further decrease with climate change. We contend that the combined influence of these two drivers is likely pervasive for many species, with changing resources offsetting or augmenting physiological limitations.

462,2020,"Multiplex networks reveal geographic constraints on illicit wildlife trafficking","Applied Network Science","Illicit wildlife trafficking poses a threat to the conservation of species and ecosystems, and represents a fundamental source of biodiversity loss, alongside climate change and large-scale land degradation. Despite the seriousness of this issue, little is known about various socio-cultural demand sources underlying trafficking networks, for example the forthright consumption of endangered species on different cultural contexts. Our study illustrates how wildlife trafficking represents a wicked problem at the intersection of criminal enforcement, cultural heritage and environmental systems management. As with similar network-based crimes, institutions are frequently ineffective at curbing wildlife trafficking, partly due to the lack of information detailing activities within illicit trading networks. To address this shortcoming, we leverage official government records documenting the illegal trade of reptiles in colombia. As such, our study contributes to the understanding of how and why wildlife trafficking persists across robust trafficking networks, which are conduits for a broader range of black-market goods. Leveraging geo-spatial data, we construct a multiplex representation of wildlife trafficking networks, which facilitates identifying network properties that are signatures of strategic trafficker behavior. In particular, our results indicate that traffickersâ actions are constrained by spatial and market customs, a result which is apparent only within an integrated multiplex representation. Characteristic levels of sub-network coupling further indicate that traffickers strategically leverage knowledge of the entire system. We argue that this multiplex representation is essential for prioritizing crime enforcement strategies aimed at disrupting robust trade networks, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and resources allocation of institutions charged with curbing illicit trafficking. We develop a generalizable model of multiplex criminal trade networks suitable for communicating with policy makers and practitioners, thereby facilitating rapid translation into public policy and environmental conservation efforts.

However, the drivers of biodiversity loss and the spatial variation in their impacts are poorly understood. Here, we explore the spatial-temporal distributions of threatened and declining (""biodiversity-loss"") species and find that these species are affected by multiple stressors, with climate and human activities being the fundamental shaping forces. There has been large spatial variation in the distribution of threatened species over china's provinces, with the biodiversity of gansu, guangdong, hainan, and shaanxi provinces severely reduced. With increasing urbanization and industrialization, the expansion of construction and worsening pollution has led to habitat retreat or degradation, and high proportions of amphibians, mammals, and reptiles are threatened. Because distributions of species and stressors vary widely across different climate zones and geographical areas, specific policies and measures are needed for preventing biodiversity loss in different regions.

This phenomenon is widespread, despite limited attention in thailand. To reduce road mortality, the roadkilled species and their distributions along the road become a significant component for designing management strategies. We surveyed vertebrate mortality covering 44 kilometers of highway 12, passing through nam nao nation park in phetchabun province of thailand for 34 replicates between august 2018 and july 2019. We recorded 1,389 carcasses of 578 amphibians, 540 reptiles, 190 mammals and 81 birds. The rate of wildlife-vehicle collisions (wvcs) was 1.089 â± 0.823 carcasses-km-1day-1, comprised mostly of amphibians. The distribution pattern of wvcs was arranged in spatial clusters. Five wildlife collision hotspots for four taxa groups were identified. Overall, the wvc presence was positively associated with vegetation types but negatively associated with distance to the forest edge, the presence of r oad barriers and the number of road lane. Concurrently, the numbers of roadkill incidents were positively associated with amphibians more than other vertebrate groups, the night time and number of daily vehicles. Our results suggest that wvc rates on hw12 vary among taxonomic groups, temporal scales and environmental factors.

465,2020,"Comparing the success of active and passive restoration in a tropical cloud forest landscape: a multi-taxa fauna approach","Plos One","Tropical forest restoration initiatives are becoming more frequent worldwide in an effort to mitigate biodiversity loss and ecosystems degradation. However, there is little consensus on whether an active or a passive restoration strategy is more successful for recovering biodiversity because few studies make adequate comparisons. Furthermore, studies on animal responses to restoration are scarce compared to those on plants, and those that assess faunal recovery often focus on a single taxon, limiting the generalization of results. We assessed the success of active (native mixed-species plantations) and passive (natural regeneration) tropical cloud forest restoration strategies based on the responses of three animal taxa: amphibians, ants, and dung beetles. We compared community attributes of these three taxa in a 23-year-old active restoration forest, a 23-year-old passive restoration forest, a cattle pasture, and a mature forest, with emphasis on forest-specialist species. We also evaluated the relationship between faunal recovery and environmental variables. For all taxa, we found that recovery of species richness and composition were similar in active and passive restoration sites. However, recovery of forest specialists was enhanced through active restoration. For both forests under restoration, similarity in species composition of all faunal groups was 60â70% with respect to the reference ecosystem due to a replacement of generalist species by forest-specialist species. The recovery of faunal communities was mainly associated with canopy and leaf litter covers. We recommend implementing active restoration using mixed plantations of native tree species and, whenever possible, selecting sites close to mature forest to accelerate the recovery of tropical cloud forest biodiversity. As active restoration is more expensive than passive restoration, both strategies might be used in a complementary manner at the landscape level to compensate for high implementation costs.

466,2020,"The best bang for the bucks: rethinking global investment in biodiversity conservation","Sustainability (Switzerland)","Biodiversity loss is a central issue in conservation biology, with protected areas being the primary approach to stop biodiversity loss. However, education has been identified as an important factor in this regard. Based on a database of threatened species and socio-economic features for 138 countries, we tested whether more protected areas or more education investment is associated with a lower proportion of threatened species (for different groups of vertebrates and plants). For this, we fitted generalized linear mixed-effects models (glmm) to assess the relative importance of socio-economic variables on the proportion of threatened species. We found that education investment was negatively associated with the proportion of threatened species in 2007 and 2017, as well as with their change rates. Conversely, the percentage of protected land was significant for reptiles but showed weak relationships with other groups. Our results suggest that only increasing protected areas will not stop or reduce biodiversity loss, as the context and peopleâs attitudes towards wildlife also play major roles here. Therefore, investing in education, in addition to protected areas, would have the missing positive effect on achieving effective species conservation actions worldwide. Â© 2020 by the authors.

In southeast asia and other tropical regions, wildlife populations are being isolated into pockets of natural habitat surrounded by road networks and monoculture plantations. Mortality from wildlifeâvehicle collisions (wvcs) is contributing to a decline in many species of conservation priority in human-modified landscapes. This study is the first in malaysia to investigate factors affecting the occurrence of wvcs. We assessed roadkill data gathered by the department of wildlife and national parks on small-, medium-, and large-sized mammals in peninsular malaysia. We examined the relationship between wildlife road accidents and several environmental factors. We found a total of 605 roadkill animals, involving 21 species, which included three species classified as endangered. Road type (plantation road or highway), year, and distance of the road from continuous and fragmented forests were significant in determining mammal mortality. Unexpectedly, the majority of road mortality occurred on palm oil plantation roads compared to highways. Mortality of small- and medium-sized mammals was greater at locations further from continuous forest than those closer to fragmented forests. Segmentation of continuous forest by roads should be avoided wherever possible to reduce the threat of roads on crossing wildlife. Â© 2020 the authors.

468,2020,"Strict protected areas are essential for the conservation of larger and threatened mammals in a priority region of the brazilian cerrado","Biological Conservation","Assessing protected area (pa) effectiveness is key to ensure the objectives of habitat protection are being achieved. There is strong evidence that legal protection reduces loss of natural vegetation, but biodiversity loss can still happen without significant changes in vegetation cover. Here we use data from a specifically designed camera trap survey to conduct a counterfactual assessment of pa effectiveness at safeguarding local biodiversity in the brazilian cerrado. We surveyed the mammal community in 517 locations at the sertão veredas-peruaãu mosaic, distributed across five strict pas (264 survey sites in five arrays) and two multiple-use pas with low management levels (253 survey sites in four arrays). We adopted a multi-species occupancy framework to analyse our dataset while also controlling for confounding factors not directly related to protection. Of the 21 species assessed, nine had higher occupancy in strict pas, one had higher occupancy in multiple-use pas, and ten did not respond to protection level. Site species richness was nearly twice as large in areas under stricter protection, with even greater differences for species richness of globally threatened and larger mammals (>15 kg). Overall we demonstrated that the strict pas surveyed support higher mammal diversity than similar areas under less restrictive management, with a particular strong effect on larger and threatened species. Given that strict pas cover only 3% of the cerrado, our results suggest that expanding the area under strict protection is likely to benefit iconic species of the brazilian savanna, such as the maned wolf and giant anteater.

469,2020,"What are we talking about? Sika deer (cervus nippon): a bibliometric network analysis","Ecological Informatics","The introduction of alien species represents the second most dramatic cause of biodiversity loss all over the world as they may negatively affect the genetic diversity of native species and represent a major problem to both conservation strategies, and functionality of the ecosystems. In the last centuries, sika deer (cervus nippon) have been widely spread from their native areal (china, japan, viet nam, korea, taiwan and russia) across most continents and they are nowadays considered one of the most invasive existing mammal species. In this study, we jointly used two software tools (vosviewer and citespace) to quantitatively review and investigate the global scientific literature on the sika deer. We reviewed and analysed the patterns and trends in global scientific literature on the species, performing co-authorship and co-occurrence analyses and creating relative network maps. The results showed a high and constant productivity of japan, followed by china and usa, with china having an increase in production over the last years. Keywords as âhybridizationâ and âintrogressionâ figured among the most frequently investigated topics, suggesting genetics as an important field of research, followed by the impacts of the species on the vegetation. Out of the species native range, the most productive country was the uk, followed by germany and czech republic, with similar preferences for the topic of âhybridizationâ and âintrogressionâ. In addition, we investigated the presence of keywords that experienced an abrupt increase in number of citations (i.e. âcitation burstâ) across the sika deer scientific literature. The analysis confirmed the previously described trends, highlighting the importance of genetic studies applied to the native fauna. We concluded that the scientific production trends on sika deer follow different and defined research flows according to the area of investigation. In addition, it is possible to notice that countries with the biggest or most invasive populations are also the most prolific. Lastly, this study highlighted the usefulness of integrating different methodologies and approaches to investigate topics in scientific literature through the support of informatics tools.

470,2020,"Deforestation leakage undermines conservation value of tropical and subtropical forest protected areas","Global Ecology And Biogeography","Aim: the establishment of protected areas is among the most widespread responses to mitigate species loss. Although protected areas are often assumed to have conservation benefits, negative impacts have also been documented. One potential negative outcome is leakage, whereby protected areas displace land-use activities harmful to conservation into adjacent areas. This can undermine protection by accelerating loss of species or skewing judgements of effectiveness. This study assessed the prevalence of deforestation leakage in a pan-tropical and subtropical selection of 120 protected areas. Location: tropical and subtropical forest regions of america, africa and asia. Time period: 2001â2017. Major taxa studied: threatened species of amphibians, birds and terrestrial mammals. Methods: we used global forest change data to assess the average yearly rate of deforestation in protected areas, protected area buffer zones and statistically matched, unprotected control areas. We calculated and compared irreplaceability of habitat for threatened amphibian, bird and terrestrial mammal species between protected areas and buffer zones. Results: in 55 cases, deforestation rates were higher in buffer zones than in protected and control areas, suggesting a relatively high prevalence of deforestation leakage stemming from protected areas. In 78.2% of documented leakage cases, reduced deforestation in protected areas was not sufficient to offset the amount of deforestation in 10â km buffer zones to a level that would be expected without protection. In 90.9% of leakage cases, the irreplaceability of species in the 10â km buffer zone was greater than that of the protected area, implying a negative impact of leakage on threatened species. Main conclusions: the results suggest that protected areas are generally effective at preventing deforestation within their jurisdiction; however, leakage patterns can undermine conservation success because buffer zones often contain habitat for threatened species. We recommend accounting for the possibility of leakage when designing new protected areas and networks. Â© 2020 the authors.

471,2020,"Does use of backyard resources explain the abundance of urban wildlife?","Frontiers In Ecology And Evolution","While urbanization is clearly contributing to biodiversity loss, certain wildlife assemblages can paradoxically be diverse and abundant in moderately developed areas. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that abundant anthropogenic resources for wildlife (i.e., food and shelter) outweigh the costs associated with urbanization. To test this hypothesis, we used camera traps to measure mammal species richness, diversity, and relative abundance (i.e., detection rate) in 58 residential yards in raleigh, north carolina, focusing on six types of features that might be used as resources: animal feeding, vegetable gardens, compost piles, chicken coops, brushpiles, and water sources. We also placed cameras at random control sites within each yard and sampled forests in nearby suburban and rural areas for comparison. We fit mixed-effects poisson models to determine whether yard features, yard-scale characteristics, or landscape-scale landcover predicted mammal relative abundance for eight species. We also tested if the relative abundance of native canid predators in yards was related to the number of prey (rodents and lagomorphs). Species richness, diversity, and relative abundance of most mammal species was higher in yards and suburban forests than in rural forests. Within a yard, purposeful feeding had the strongest effect on animal relative abundance, with eastern gray squirrels (sciurus carolinensis) being the most common (32.3 squirrels/day at feeders; 0.55 at control sites; 0.29 in suburban forests; and 0.10 in rural forests). We observed species using (e.g., eating) most yard features, although canids were less likely than other taxa to use resources in yards. The presence of a yard feature did not strongly affect the abundance of species at the control site in the yard, suggesting the influence of these features was highly localized. The relative abundance of predators had a positive association with prey relative abundance, and predators were less common in yards with fences. These results demonstrate that there is high use of anthropogenic resources, especially supplemental feeding by urban wildlife, and this increase in prey species may then attract predators, which supports the hypothesis that use of supplemental food resources explains the abundance of urban wildlife.

472,2020,"Environmental drivers of diving behavior and space-use of juvenile endangered caribbean hawksbill sea turtles identified using acoustic telemetry","Marine Ecology Progress Series","Space-use by aquatic ectotherms is closely linked to environmental factors such as temperature due to thermal-mediated metabolism and energy requirements. These factors are important, as they may alter an animalâs exposure to food/predators, hinder physiological function, increase competitive interactions, or even prompt population or biodiversity loss. Using general linear mixed-effects models, we investigated the influence of medium-term (monthsâyears) environmental (diel period, water temperature, season, wind speed, air pressure, habitat type) and biological (turtle size) variation on space-use metrics for the critically endangered hawksbill sea turtle eretmochelys imbricata, including dive duration, activity space, and rate of movement. We tracked 17 resident juveniles between august 2015 and may 2018 with a compact acoustic telemetry array (35â41 receivers in ~1 km2) in brewers bay, us virgin islands. Diel differences in space-use were significant and highlighted periods of relative inactivity (e.g. Resting) during the night and activity (e.g. Foraging) during the day. Water temperature was also an important covariate influencing behavior leading to shorter dive durations and higher rates of movement in warmer temperatures. High contribution of random effects (individual and year) to model variation was also apparent, suggesting that juvenile hawksbills can operate outside the relatively narrow environmental range experienced within the study area. Nevertheless, ongoing climate trends (e.g. Warmer temperatures and more extreme weather events) pose a significant concern for hawksbill populations, as juveniles spend their developmental period in shallow nearshore areas where environmental impacts will likely be greatest.

473,2020,"Reconciling rubber expansion with biodiversity conservation","Current Biology","Over five million hectares of tropical forest were cleared across mainland southeast asia and sub-saharan africa for rubber plantations between 2003 and 2017 [1, 2]. Millions of hectares of further clearance are predicted as rubber demand rises, which will have major consequences for biodiversity [3]. A key question is how to reconcile rubber expansion with biodiversity conservation. We assessed the feasibility of simultaneously meeting global future demand for rubber with conservation of extinction-threatened amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. We compared the spatial congruence of rubber bioclimatic suitability with extinction vulnerability [4] in africa, asia, and new guinea, where large-scale rubber cultivation is viable, and simulated rubber expansion under different scenarios. We found no âwin-winâ areas with highest rubber suitability and lowest extinction vulnerability. Projected rubber demand could be met by allowing expansion primarily in new guinea and african guinea. However, new guinea has high ecosystem intactness and both regions are rich in endemics. Scenarios suggest converting only areas suitable for cultivation would cause the largest biodiversity losses, including endangered species, whereas prioritizing conservation would result in only the conversion of highly unsuitable land. Compromise scenarios that balance production with conservation could cut biodiversity losses by two-thirds, protecting most endangered species while maintaining high rubber suitability. Development of high-yielding hardy clones expands the amount of win-win areas, as well as suitable areas with high extinction risk. These trade-offs reveal that clonal research and development, strategic corporate and government land-use policies, and rigorous impact assessments are needed to prevent severe biodiversity losses from rubber development.

474,2020,"Activity patterns of aoudad (ammotragus lervia) in a mediterranean habitat","Journal Of Vertebrate Biology","There is increasing recognition of the occurrence of non-native species that are invasive and potentially contribute to biodiversity loss. A two-year camera trap survey was undertaken on mountain mosor, croatia to determine the daily and seasonal activity patterns of recently introduced non-native aoudad (ammotragus lervia). Aoudad were most active in open rocky habitats and least active in forest habitats. The effect of habitat on the recorded number of aoudad was significant, while the effects of month and the interaction month ã habitat were not. The results showed a typical bimodal activity pattern of aoudad, with a modest peak in activity between 5:00 and 9:00 a.m., and a second, more pronounced activity peak between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. Since the native habitat of aoudad is similar to that in the mediterranean region, the inferred range of daily and seasonal activities show that the species is well adapted to the new habitat.

We performed a study in the southern brazil involving three generalist species with abundant and wide amount of distribution in latin america, with the objective of evaluating seed ingestion by positive criteria about its germination. We investigated the role of bird digestion on the germination of a native pioneer species, the brazilian pepperâschinus terebinthifolia, an invasive alien species in many parts of the world. We compared the germination of this native with those of the invasive australian cheesewood (pittosporum undulatum) concurrently. Interestingly, the effect of potentiating germination was more intense in the introduced species than for the native species. Pitangus sulphuratus is an important potential disperser for the germination of p. Undulatum seeds, enabling the colonization of new areas in the atlantic forest of southern brazil.

476,2020,"Trade-offs between biodiversity and agriculture are moving targets in dynamic landscapes","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Understanding how biodiversity responds to intensifying agriculture is critical to mitigating the trade-offs between them. These trade-offs are particularly strong in tropical and subtropical deforestation frontiers, yet it remains unclear how changing landscape context in such frontiers alters agricultureâbiodiversity tradeâoffs. We focus on the argentinean chaco, a global deforestation hotspot, to explore how landscape context shapes trade-off curves between agricultural intensity and avian biodiversity. We use a space-for-time approach and integrate a large field dataset of bird communities (197 species, 234 survey plots), three agricultural intensity metrics (meat yield, energy yield and profit) and a range of environmental covariates in a hierarchical bayesian occupancy framework. Woodland extent in the landscape consistently determines how individual bird species, and the bird community as a whole, respond to agricultural intensity. Many species switch in their fundamental response, from decreasing occupancy with increased agricultural intensity when woodland extent in the landscape is low (loser species), to increasing occupancy with increased agricultural intensity when woodland extent is high (winner species). This suggests that landscape context strongly mediates who wins and loses along agricultural intensity gradients. Likewise, where landscapes change, such as in deforestation frontiers, the very nature of the agricultureâbiodiversity tradeâoffs can change as landscapes transformation progresses. Synthesis and applications. Schemes to mitigate agricultureâbiodiversity tradeâoffs, such as land sparing or sharing, must consider landscape context. Strategies that are identified based on a snapshot of data risk failure in dynamic landscapes, particularly where agricultural expansion continues to reduce natural habitats. Rather than a single, fixed strategy, adaptive management of agricultureâbiodiversity tradeâoffs is needed in such situations. Here we provide a toolset for considering changing landscape contexts when exploring such trade-offs. This can help to better align agriculture and biodiversity in tropical and subtropical deforestation frontiers.

Hatchery technology is a promising method for restoring fisheries where spawning substrates are degraded and/or lacking. In the current study, a phragmites australis stereo artificial floating wetland (safw) was constructed in an urban river (tuanwang river, shanghai), and palm sheets were laid under the safw frame to imitate the spawning grounds for phytophilous fish. Fish species with five spawning types were distinguished from nineteen fish species in the study area. After viscid eggs were found to be attached to the palm sheets, the eggs were distinguished by the subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase i gene. All of the eggs belonged to six fish species: culter ilishaeformis, cyprinus carpio, cyprinus auratus, cultrichthys erythropterus, rhodeus sinensis, and hemiculter leucisculus. Cyprinus auratus and cyprinus carpio accounted for the vast majority, and the number of these species was significantly greater than that of the other species. Dissolved oxygen and light intensity at the water surface were significantly higher than those at the deep water sites (p < 0.05), and all viscid eggs were inclined to be distributed at water depths of -0.5 and â 1.5 m. The results of redundancy analysis (rda) showed that both water depth and dissolved oxygen were the main environmental variables in all spawning periods. The current study suggested that the relatively inexpensive p. Australis safw was a useful hatchery technology for creating spawning grounds for phytophilous fish in urban rivers.

479,2020,"Prioritizing habitat core areas and corridors for a large carnivore across its range","Animal Conservation","With increasing loss and fragmentation of habitats driving the emerging global extinction crisis, paired with limited resources for conservation, there is an immense need to identify and prioritize the most important areas for conservation actions. The goal of this study was to measure, map and rank core areas and corridors for mainland clouded leopard (a forest indicator species) across its entire range in southeast asia. We used an empirically based landscape resistance model developed from range-wide camera survey data, cumulative resistant kernel analysis to define core areas and least-cost network analysis to identify corridors for long-distance dispersal. We then ranked core areas based on their strength and size, and corridors based on their strength and the strength of core areas they connect. We found that the most important core areas and corridors are concentrated in southeast asia, largely in myanmar, laos and malaysia. Myanmar contains nearly the entirety of the first and third highest ranked core areas, as well as the most important network of corridors in se asia. Almost the entire territory of laos constitutes one large potential core area, ranked as the second most important across the clouded leopardâs range. A large number (22) of very small (<8000â km2) and fairly isolated core areas are in china. Only 24% of clouded leopard core areas and 17% of corridors are protected. This is the first example of using empirical models to prioritize conservation actions across the full range of a large carnivore. Our analysis identifies the location, size and connectivity of the most important remaining habitats of the clouded leopard across its range, which could provide quantitative guidance in the efforts to maximize the efficacy of regional conservation initiatives to conserve this species and the ecosystems it inhabits.

480,2020,"Principles for including conservation messaging in wildlife-based tourism","People And Nature","There is growing evidence that wildlife-based tourism can be a valuable pathway to transform the environmental knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of tourists, if complemented by effective conservation messaging and proactive interpretive experiences. Yet, such conservation messaging is not always a priority for many wildlife-based tourism operators, who often avoid exposing happy tourists to the daunting biodiversity crisis. In this paper, we argue that failing to encourage tourists to do more on behalf of wildlife represents a missed opportunity for conservation. Based on a comprehensive review of the academic literature, we show that conservation messaging is virtually absent from many mainstream wildlife-based tourism operations, often failing to connect global audiences to conservation issues. We found that the scholarly literature on the effectiveness of different techniques, approaches and contents of conservation messaging in wildlife-based tourism is meagre at best. Yet, alternative forms of communicating conservation-related messages are opening new avenues to broaden the conservation potential of wildlife-based tourism. We suggest a set of principles for improving the implementation of conservation messaging in wildlife-based tourism operations in order to maximize their educational potential. We end by calling for further research efforts on the factors implicated in effective conservation messaging in wildlife-based tours in order to pave the way for a new era of conservation-oriented tourism.

481,2020,"Smallholdings with high oil palm yield also support high bird species richness and diverse feeding guilds","Environmental Research Letters","Biodiversity has been devastated globally in the past hundred years, largely because of land conversion and agricultural intensification. Conversion of tropical forest to oil palm plantations is one of the greatest per unit area contributors to biodiversity loss in southeast asia. Concerned consumers, mainly from developed countries, have begun demanding sustainable palm oil in response to these issues. More 'biodiversity-friendly' oil palm production is also in demand, similar to that of other commodity crops (e.g. Coffee, cacao). However, farming practices that improve biodiversity are thought to reduce yield, leading to increased pressure to clear more forest, resulting in further biodiversity loss. Here, we explore relationships between oil palm yield and avian biodiversity. To gather data on yields and agricultural inputs, we interviewed smallholders in selangor, peninsular malaysia. We also quantified bird species richness, feeding guild diversity, abundance, and vegetation structure in smallholdings. We found that smallholdings with high yields were characterised by high species richness and feeding guild diversity, but low bird abundance. Our empirical results show the benefits to both yield and avian biodiversity of a wildlife-friendly strategy in smallholdings. We encourage the integration of farming practices with management that improves biodiversity to reconcile oil palm production and nature conservation. Â© 2020 institute of physics publishing.

482,2020,"Beyond the pond: terrestrial habitat use by frogs in a changing climate","Biological Conservation","Amphibians are proportionately over-represented in the current wave of global biodiversity loss. Disease and habitat loss are implicated in many amphibian species declines, but amphibians are also predicted to be sensitive to changes in climate, particularly changes in temperature and loss of moisture. These changes could severely impact frog use of terrestrial habitats. We used data from a long-term (2007â18) landscape-scale experiment in south-eastern australia to test the effects of terrestrial habitat characteristics and restoration treatments on frog species. We found declines in species richness and in the occurrences of two locally-common species (limnodynastes tasmaniensis and uperoleia laevigata). These declines were associated with high maximum temperatures, low minimum temperatures and low rainfall. Coarse woody debris addition was associated with higher species richness and l. Tasmaniensis occurrence, but this effect was not greater in times of reduced rainfall and high maximum temperatures, implying a weak ârefugiaâ effect. Frogs were positively associated with wetter sites, and this association increased with higher maximum temperatures. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence that show that prolonged periods of drought pose a key threat to frog populations and that short periods of relief from drought conditions are insufficient to allow recovery of terrestrial frog populations over the long term. Restoration efforts could include the provision of coarse woody debris and should also ensure that good quality aquatic habitat, such as drought-resistant ponds and dams, are available throughout hot and dry times as a supplement to ephemeral aquatic habitat.

(2019) investigated the effects of a fish ladder located near the porto primavera dam (paranã river, brazil) in order to evaluate if it provided free passage for the migratory fish prochilodus lineatus. Fish were marked with pit-tags and movements were monitored within the ladder over a 3.5-year period. The main finding was âour study identified bidirectional movements by p. Lineatus through the porto primavera fish ladder, including multiple passes by the same fishâ (p. 241). It led authors to conclude: âour results suggest that by providing bidirectional connectivity between upstream and downstream habitats, fishways can be an effective tool for preserving populations of p. Lineatus and probably for other species of prochilodusâ (p. 242). Both conclusions, however, may not be correct, because they go beyond the data directly presented in the manuscript. The study overlooked issues related to the spatial scale and experimental design, since it was limited to investigate patterns of movement within the fish ladder alone. In this sense, they encourage the reader to accept patterns and conclusions that were not specifically investigated (e.g., migratory dynamics and conservation success), or that cannot be fully supported by the data (e.g., bidirectional movements and efficient passage). As the conclusions presented in the study have direct implications for the licensing process of hydropower dams and the management/conservation of neotropical migratory fishes, we provide suggestions to highlight additional important factors and issues that should be considered or addressed in future research.

484,2020,"Habitat loss in the restricted range of the endemic ghanaian cichlid limbochromis robertsi","Biotropica","Remote sensing has become an integral and invaluable tool to inform biodiversity conservation and monitoring of habitat degradation and restoration over time. Despite the disproportionately high levels of biodiversity loss in freshwater ecosystems worldwide, ichthyofauna are commonly overlooked in favor of other keystone species. Freshwater fish, as indicators of overall aquatic ecosystem health, can also be indicators of larger scale problems within an ecosystem. As a case study with multi-temporal, multi-resolution satellite imagery, we examined deforestation and forest fragmentation around the atewa forest reserve, ghana. Within small creeks, limbochromis robertsi, a unique freshwater cichlid with an extremely limited distribution range, can be found. Historically, the land cover in the area has undergone substantial deforestation for agriculture and artisanal small-scale mining. In the 1389-km2 study area, we found deforestation accelerated along with increased forest fragmentation in the 2014â2017 period (167.4â km2 of deforestation) with the majority of the forest loss along the river and creek banks due to small-scale mining operations and increased agriculture. Field visits indicated a decrease in the total l.â robertsi population by approximately 90% from the early 1990s to 2018. Its distribution has been reduced to higher elevations by anthropogenic habitat barriers at low elevations and the presence of predatory species. Loss of riparian forest through land use and cover change to mining and agriculture contributes to the habitat degradation for this endemic species.

Identifying the contributions of alien species to native species declines could help target management efforts. Globally, seabirds breeding on islands have proven to be highly susceptible to alien species. The breeding colonies of the pink-footed shearwater (ardenna creatopus) are threatened by the negative impacts of alien mammals. We combined breeding monitoring data with a hierarchical model to separate the effects of different alien mammal assemblages on the burrow occupancy and hatching success of the pink-footed shearwater in the juan fernãndez archipelago, chile. We show that alien mammals affected the rates of burrow occupancy, but had little effect on hatching success. Rabbits produced the highest negative impacts on burrow occupancy, whereas the effects of other alien mammals were more uncertain. In addition, we found differences in burrow occupancy between islands regardless of their alien mammal assemblages. Managing rabbits will improve the reproductive performance of this shearwater, but research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which alien mammals affect the shearwaters and to explain why burrow occupancy varies between islands.

487,2020,"Population reduction by hunting helps control human-wildlife conflicts for a species that is a conservation success story","Plos One","Among the world's large carnivores, american black bears (ursus americanus) are the foremost conservation success story. Populations have been expanding across north america because the species is adaptable and tolerant of living near people, and because management agencies in the u.s. And canada controlled hunting and other human-sources of mortality. As a result, human-black bear conflicts (damage to property, general nuisance, threat to human safety) have dramatically increased in some areas, making it urgently important to develop and deploy a variety of mitigation tools. Previous studies claimed that legal hunting did not directly reduce conflicts, but they did not evaluate whether hunting controlled conflicts via management of population size. Here, we compared temporal patterns of phonedin complaints about black bears (total â¼63,500) in minnesota, usa, over 4 decades to corresponding bear population estimates: both doubled during the first decade. We also quantified natural bear foods, and found that large year-to-year fluctuations affected numbers of complaints; however, since this variation is due largely to weather, this factor cannot be managed. Complaints fell sharply when the management agency (1) shifted more responsibility for preventing and mitigating conflicts to the public; and (2) increased hunting pressure to reduce the bear population. This population reduction was more extreme than intended, however, and after hunting pressure was curtailed, population regrowth was slower than anticipated; consequently both population size and complaints remained at relatively low levels statewide for 2 decades (although with local hotspots). These long-term data indicated that conflicts can be kept in tolerable bounds by managing population size through hunting; but due to the bluntness of this instrument and deficiencies and uncertainties in monitoring and manipulating populations, it is wiser to maintain a population at a level where conflicts are socially-acceptable than try to reduce it once it is well beyond that point.

The natura 2000 network is the largest protected area network in the world and was created to protect europe's threatened species and habitats, often requiring active management. This study assesses the effectiveness of areas classified under the eu birds directive at protecting western europe's agro-steppes, the last remnants of suitable habitat for several endangered bird species. We quantify agro-steppe habitat change in the last 10 years using high-resolution aerial images of 21 special protection areas and surrounding areas. The selected spas hold one third of the global population of great bustards otis tarda, a flagship conservation species. Agro-steppe area losses occurred across all sites surveyed but were 45% lower inside natura 2000 compared to non-protected areas. Natura 2000 sites still lost over 35,000 ha of agro-steppe habitat in 10 years, an area that could hold more than 500 great bustards. These low yield farmlands are being converted predominately to permanent and irrigated crops. At the current rate of habitat conversion, agro-steppes could be reduced to 50% of the present area during the next century. Moreover, the greater conversions outside protected sites may transform the remaining agro-steppes into isolated âislandsâ with low population connectivity. Our study on agro-steppes illustrates the relevant contribution of natura 2000 at protecting europe's key habitats, but also highlights crucial insufficiencies that still need to be addressed to achieve the cbd conservation targets and halt biodiversity loss.

489,2020,"Move to nocturnality not a universal trend in carnivore species on disturbed landscapes","Oikos","Anthropogenic landscape change is a leading driver of biodiversity loss. Preceding dramatic changes such as wildlife population declines and range shifts, more subtle responses may signal impending larger-scale change. For example, disturbance-induced shifts to speciesâ activity patterns may disrupt temporal niche partitioning along the 24-h time axis, compromising community structure via altered competitive interactions. We investigated the impacts of human landscape disturbance on speciesâ activity patterns and temporal niche partitioning in the canadian rocky mountain carnivore guild using camera trap images collected across two regions encompassing a wide gradient of human footprint. Applying kernel density estimation techniques, we tested for carnivore speciesâ activity shifts 1) between a low versus high disturbance landscape, and 2) in relation to site-scale disturbance. To test our hypothesis that human disturbance impacts speciesâ temporal niche partitioning, we modelled activity overlap between co-occurring carnivore species in relation to natural and anthropogenic landscape features, as well as carnivore community composition. Multiple carnivore species altered activity patterns between the low versus high disturbance landscapes and camera sites, but these shifts varied considerably among species. While wolves appeared to increase nocturnal activity in relation to disturbance, coyote activity consistently trended towards cathemerality and marten increased diurnal activity. Detecting effects of landscape disturbance on activity overlap between co-occurring species was highly sensitive to site-level detection sample sizes, and our results suggest altered temporal niche partitioning between marten and wolverine in relation to forest cover. This study indicates that mesocarnivores may respond differently and perhaps indirectly to anthropogenic disturbance compared to apex predators. Apex predator shifts to nocturnality may facilitate a âbehavioural releaseâ in mesocarnivores. This may be a likely component of mesocarnivore population release, with important management implications for ecological communities on disturbed landscapes. Â© 2020 nordic society oikos.

490,2020,"A practical approach to measuring the biodiversity impacts of land conversion","Methods In Ecology And Evolution","Further progress in reducing biodiversity loss relies on the improved quantification of the connections between drivers of habitat loss and subsequent biodiversity impacts. To this end, biodiversity impact metrics should be able to report linked trends in specific human activities and changes in biodiversity state, accounting for both the ecology of different species and the cumulative effects of historical habitat losses. These characteristics are not currently captured within a single metric. Here, we develop a globally applicable methodological framework that uses freely and publicly available datasets to quantify the relative impacts of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity. We use species-specific habitat suitability models to link specific land uses to ensuing changes in the likelihood that local populations of those species will persist. To illustrate our approach, we assess the impacts of soy expansion and other land uses within the brazilian cerrado on over 2,000 species of amphibians, birds, mammals and plants for three periods between 2000 and 2014. Our results showed that mammals and plants suffered the greatest overall reduction of suitable habitat. However, among endemic and near-endemic speciesâwhich face greatest risk of global extinction from habitat conversion in the cerradoâbirds and mammals were the most affected groups. While conversion of natural vegetation to grassland and planted pastures were together responsible for most of the biodiversity impact of recent changes, soy expansion (via direct conversion of natural vegetation) had the greatest impact per unit area. The total biodiversity impact of recent land-use change was concentrated in the southern states of the cerradoâminas gerãis, goiãs and mato grossoâbut the impact on biodiversity of production of soy was greatest within the agricultural frontiers of bahãa and piauã. The flexibility of our approach to examine linkages between biodiversity loss and specific human activities has clear potential to better characterize the pathways by which habitat loss drivers operate. Its capacity to incorporate species-specific ecological needs, through a globally applicable methodology, can improve the tangibility of biodiversity loss assessments. Â© 2020 the authors.

Objectives: we identified safe dispersal corridors and conflict-prone movement bottlenecks for persian leopard (panthera pardus saxicolor) between protected areas in the alborz mountains, iran, by mapping habitat, landscape permeability, and conflict risk. We then identified priority areas for conservation interventions according to the intensities of different threats. Methods: we mapped land cover using landsat satellite images, gathered data on leopard and prey distributions and livestock depredation events via interview surveys in 69 cells of 6 ã 6â km each. We then used occupancy modeling to identify habitat patches, used circuit theory modeling to analyze landscape permeability, and assessed human-leopard conflict risk using generalized linear models. Results: leopard habitat use increased with prey availability and decreased with elevation. Prey distribution, in turn, was mostly negatively influenced by agricultural lands and distance from protected areas. Conflict risk (i.e., probability of leopard depredation on livestock) was high in landscapes where agriculture was widespread and historical forest loss high. Not accounting for conflicts overestimated connectivity among habitat patches substantially. Conclusions: human-carnivore conflicts are an important constraint to connectivity and should be considered in corridor assessments. Our study shows how habitat analysis, connectivity assessment, and conflict risk mapping can be combined to guide conservation planning for identifying habitat networks and safe corridors for carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.

492,2020,"The conflict between scavenging birds and farmers: field observations do not support people's perceptions","Biological Conservation","Human-wildlife conflict is an important emerging threat producing biodiversity loss around the world. It is therefore key to study people's perceptions in order to overcome this conflict. Scavenger birds represent an interesting study case, since some people consider them beneficial but many have negative perceptions regarding their supposed potential role as livestock predators, resulting in intense conflicts with human populations. These conflicts could be responsible for harmful attitudes such as lethal control methods that affect the demography and conservation of scavenger bird populations. We studied the conflict between farmers and obligate and facultative scavenger birds in northwest patagonia, argentina, to ascertain whether people's perceptions are supported by field observations. We interviewed farmers and made field observations on farms in the same area. We found that 92% of the farmers believe that scavenger birds (including both obligate and facultative) present in the study area are harmful to livestock. However, our observations show that while some harm to livestock may occur, predation events are exceptional. Field observations thus do not support people's perceptions. We recommend the use of better livestock management and increased human presence during the birth of lambs in order to reduce the time during which scavenger birds can potentially cause harm. Our results are important for the development of better conservation policies to mitigate conflicts between farmers and scavenger birds based on scientific information, but at the same time considering local culture and perceptions.

493,2020,"Global trends of habitat destruction and consequences for parrot conservation","Global Change Biology","Human advance on natural habitats is a major cause of biodiversity loss. This transformation process represents a profound change in wooded environments, disrupting original communities of flora and fauna. Many species are highly dependent on forests, especially parrots (psittaciformes) with almost a third of their species threatened by extinction. Most parrot species occur in tropical and subtropical forests, and given the forest dependence of most species, this is the main reason why habitat loss has been highlighted as the main threat for the group. Such habitat loss acts in synergy with other important threats (e.g., logging and poaching), which become especially problematic in certain developing countries along tropical latitudes. In this study, we used available information on parrot distributions, species traits, iucn assessment, habitat loss and timber extraction for different periods, and distribution of protected areas, to determine conservation hotspots for the group, and analyze potential changes in the conservation status of these species. We detected four conservation hotspots for parrots: two in the neotropics and two in oceania, all of them facing different degrees of threat in regard of current habitat loss and agricultural trends. Our results suggest that the future of the group is subject to policymaking in specific regions, especially in the northeastern andes and the atlantic forest. In addition, we predicted that agricultural expansion will have a further negative effect on the conservation status of parrots, pushing many parrot species to the edge of extinction in the near future. Our results have conservation implications by recommending protected areas in specific parrot conservation hotspots. Our recommendations to mitigate conservation risks to this group of umbrella species would also benefit many other coexisting species as well.

494,2020,"Rapid assessment of avian species richness and abundance using acoustic indices","Ecological Indicators","Accelerating global shifts in climate and land use change are altering natural habitats and species assemblages, making management interventions crucial to halt the biodiversity crisis. Management decisions must be informed by accurate biodiversity assessments. However, such assessments are often time consuming, expensive, and require specialist knowledge. Monitoring environmental sound may offer a novel method for rapid biodiversity assessment. Changes in species assemblages at a given location are reflected in the site's acoustic energy, termed the soundscape. Soundscapes can be readily described using acoustic indices; metrics based on objective features of recordings such as pitch and amplitude. Changes in acoustic indices values may therefore reflect changes in species assemblages, alerting land managers to shifts in wildlife populations. However, thus far, evidence supporting the use of acoustic indices in biodiversity monitoring has been equivocal. Here, we test the practical application of acoustic indices for biodiversity monitoring while solving methodological issues and providing conceptual clarity. Using 84 h of audio recordings covering 315 dawns from 43 sites, coupled with bird assemblage and vegetation data collected in the field, we demonstrate strong relationships between acoustic indices and avian species richness and abundance. In contrast with many previous studies, we found that sites with high bird species-richness and abundance had less even soundscapes (i.e. Acoustic energy was less evenly distributed among frequencies) compared with sites with low species richness and abundance. Crucially, these patterns were coherent across multiple acoustic indices, and across habitat types, emphasising their utility for monitoring. Acoustic indices sensitive to the frequencies at which birds sing are most useful for monitoring avian communities; the acoustic evenness index, biophony index, and the biophony component of the normalised difference soundscape index exhibited the strongest relationship with species richness. Land managers can use acoustic indices for biodiversity monitoring, complementing other, more established, assessment methods.

495,2020,"Investigating support for management of the pet trade invasion risk","Journal Of Wildlife Management","The non-native pet trade contributes directly to species invasions, thereby threatening wildlife. Biological invasions influence environmental change, resulting in species extinctions and biodiversity loss. To mitigate the pet trade invasion risk, interventions are required to prevent trade in non-native animals with high invasion potential, impulse or ill-informed purchases of non-native pets by individuals who may release these animals, and the deliberate release of non-native animals by pet owners. Interventions are also required to prevent the establishment of non-native animals that have been released by pet owners (e.g., euthanasia). The successful implementation of these interventions depends on the support of pet owners and the public in the form of political support for, and compliance with, interventions. In 2017â2018, using both mail and online surveys, we measured the support of 1,171 members of the public and 550 owners of non-native pets in florida, usa, for 7 different interventions to mitigate the pet trade invasion risk, and we investigated determinants of this support. We found that individuals' support for interventions depended on their concern related to the invasion risks associated with the pet trade, trust in government to manage the pet trade, perceptions of how effective interventions would be in mitigating the pet trade invasion risk, and demographic characteristics. Support for interventions differed across pet owners and the public. Educating pet owners about the traits and cost of care for non-native animals and providing them with options to relinquish unwanted pets may reduce the pet trade invasion risk. Engaging the pet trade in the design of interventions to mitigate invasion risks is likely important to attain voluntary compliance with these interventions. The effectiveness of interventions also depends on enforcement by agencies. Implementing interventions that effectively reduce the pet trade invasion risk is important to protect native and endangered wildlife. Â© 2020 the wildlife society.

496,2020,"Riparian reserves promote insectivorous bat activity in oil palm dominated landscapes","Frontiers In Forests And Global Change","The expansion of oil palm agriculture has contributed to biodiversity loss in southeast asia and elsewhere in the tropics. Riparian reserves (areas of native forest along waterways) have the potential to maintain forest biodiversity and associated ecological processes within these agricultural landscapes. Using acoustic sampling, we investigated the value of riparian reserves for insectivorous bats in oil palm plantations in sabah, malaysian borneo. We compared general bat activity, foraging activity, and species occupancy between riparian areas in forest and riparian reserves in oil palm plantations. Overall bat activity varied little between riparian reserves in oil palm and riparian forest. Rather, activity was greatest in areas with a high forest canopy, irrespective of how much forest was available within or outside the riparian reserve. Bat foraging activity, as well as the occupancy of two species, was greatest in the forest sites, and while bats were detected in the oil palm riparian reserves, both foraging and occupancy were more associated with topographic ruggedness than forest amount or height. Our results indicate that habitat structure within riparian reserves may be more important than reserve size for supporting insectivorous bat diversity within oil palm landscapes. These findings provide important insights into the extent of the ecological benefits provided by conservation set-asides in forest-agricultural landscapes in the tropics.

Particular attention has been paid to alleged wildlife losses, especially elephants in botswana. This article considers some of the issues surrounding hunting bans and protected areas with a view to conserving elephants. In botswana, local people were removed from protected areas after being blamed for declines in wildlife numbers. Utilising government and other scientific wildlife data, the hunting ban cannot be shown to have had any significant impact on the conservation of elephants and other game species. Local people argue that many of their activities are sustainable, maintaining that they are generally not responsible for biodiversity losses and environmental degradation. Population growth, the expansion of agricultural, livestock and mining activities, the construction of veterinary cordon fences and increases in water point distribution have led to localised environmental degradation. The 'great elephant debate' became an important political issue during the run-up to the botswana elections of october 2019. Local communities sought to ensure that they would be able to obtain benefits from wildlife tourism which had been denied them during the hunting ban.

499,2020,"Unravelling effects of grazing intensity on genetic diversity and fitness of desert vegetation","Perspectives In Ecology And Conservation","Biodiversity conservation focuses on species and/or populations, but preserving genetic diversity and structure has received limited attention and even less maintaining species evolutionary potential over generations. Genetic diversity is an essential component of biodiversity enabling speciesâ persistence, particularly under disturbances. Via sexual reproduction genetic diversity is transmitted across generations and greater outcrossing in parental populations will lead to greater genetic diversity in their offspring. Grazing by exotic large herbivores is one of the main disturbances driving biodiversity loss threatening rangelands sustainability worldwide. We investigated grazing effects on fitness and genetic diversity of parental and offspring cohorts of prosopis alpataco from patagonian monte desert. We collected fresh leaves and seeds from 10 independent rangelands with different herbivore density, forming a grazing gradient, and estimated genetic parameters from allele frequencies using isoenzymes. We recorded plant size, seed weight, seed set, seedling emergence and mortality as proxies of plant fitness. Applying regression models and path analysis (d-separation) approaches we observed that increasing grazing reduced seed set and seedling emergence, and significantly increased seedling mortality. Parental and offspring suffered from inbreeding. Moreover, we found genetic diversity loss throughout cohorts in all rangelands, however, this loss was relatively lower at intermediate grazing intensities. The introduction of large herbivores in unmanaged rangelands affected vegetation structure, jeopardizing their evolutionary potential and system sustainability. Therefore, natural revegetation may be compromised by aggravated genetic diversity losses along generations that might be deepened in drylands under forecasted climate change. This highlights the importance of evaluating and conserving genetic diversity.

In the venezuelan guajira peninsula, artisanal fishing of marine turtles by the indigenous wayuã people has occurred for generations. Nevertheless, understanding the issues regarding turtle take is challenging. Surveys and semi-structured interviews were carried out at eight landing sites located in three different zones in kazuzain village, middle guajira. Carapaces or plastrons were recorded to estimate take level, and measured to determine life stage. Minimum take was 167 marine turtles over 53 weeks, or 3.15 turtles/week on average (estimated 163.8/yr). Most records encountered were from green turtles (n=154; 92.2%), and the majority of these were immature (n=76; 89.4%). Key-informants reported that marine turtles were not the target catch. However, most interviewees affirmed that take of marine turtles in kazuzain is not only for traditional purposes, but also to meet economic shortfalls. They also stated that trade of marine turtles has increased over the last ten years due to the venezuelan economic crisis. This is the first assessment of marine turtle take in this village and fills an information gap that can aid resource managers to mitigate the impacts of take, and develop potential conservation solutions for marine turtle aggregations and the people that depend on them.

Assessing the effect of wild boar presence on the occurrence and activity patterns of other mammals","Plos One","Wild boar are considered one the worldâs worst invasive species and linked to biodiversity loss, competition for resources, predation of native species, and habitat modifications. In this study, we use camera traps to evaluate whether the invasive wild boar had an effect on the medium-sized mammal community of a protected area in southern brazil. Based on photographic records, we evaluated whether the presence and relative abundance of wild boar was associated with a decrease in diversity or change in activity of medium-sized mammals. All comparisons were made between samples where wild boar were present or absent. The records of each camera during a season were considered a sample. The wild boar was the fourth most common species in the study area being present in 7.8% of the photographic records. The species richness of mammals was not negatively affected by the occurrence of wild boar and most common species did not exhibit changes in the daily activity pattern. However, we recorded an increase in the time elapsed between an observation of wild boar and the record of the next species relative to the average latency period observed among other mammalian species. This average latency period was similar to that observed in the case of large predators such as puma, and its increase could be reflective partly of the avoidance of native species to wild boar. Nevertheless, our results show that the effect of invasive wild boar on the mammal community is not large as expected. Â© 2020 silveira de oliveira et al.

The inclusion of biotic factors in the predictor suite can significantly increase the predictive power of such models, leading to a model closer to the realized niche for the species under investigation. In this study, we provide evidence of niche overlap between gray woolly monkeys (lagothrix cana) and black-faced black spider monkeys (ateles chamek) based on locality and ecological data covering their complete geographic range in the amazon forests of brazil, peru and bolivia. We also estimate the potential distribution of l. Cana using environmental predictors, and the distribution of a. Chamek as a biotic factor. Finally, we quantified current and future habitat loss and areas under legal protection. We found that only 39% of the l. Cana area of occupancy is under legal protection and that the species could potentially lose up to 58% of habitat in the next 30â years. We also show that the use of a closely-related species that has a more robust dataset can improve enms of poorly studied, rare and/or cryptic species. The framework developed here can be applied to a wide range of sympatric species if they share similar ecological requirements. Since our focal species are the most frugivorous primates in our study region and especially vulnerable to habitat loss, the identification of highly suitable areas for both taxa can help to protect other forest-dwellingâ species, reducing the rate of overall biodiversity loss.

503,2020,"The effects of tropical secondary forest regeneration on avian phylogenetic diversity","Journal Of Applied Ecology","The conversion of tropical forests to farmland is a key driver of the current extinction crisis. With the present rate of deforestation unlikely to subside, secondary forests that regenerate on abandoned agricultural land may provide an option for safeguarding biodiversity. While species richness (sr) may recover as secondary forests get older, the extent to which phylogenetic diversity (pd)âthe total amount of evolutionary history present in a communityâis conserved is less clear. Maximizing pd has been argued to be important to conserve both evolutionary heritage and ecosystem function. Here, we investigate the effects of secondary forest regeneration on pd in birds. The regeneration of secondary forests could lead to a community of closely related species, despite maintaining comparable sr to primary forests, and thus have diminished biodiversity value with reduced evolutionary heritage. We use a meta-dataset of paired primary and secondary forest sites to show that, over time, forest specialist species returned across all sites as secondary forest age increased. Forest specialists colonize secondary tropical forests in both the old world and the new world, but recovery of pd and community composition with time is only evident in the old world. Synthesis and applications. While preserving primary tropical forests remains a core conservation goal, our results emphasize the important role of secondary forest in maintaining tropical forest biodiversity. Biodiversity recovery differs between old and new world secondary forests and with proximity to primary forest, highlighting the need to consider local or regional differences in landscape composition and species characteristics, especially resilience to forest degradation and dispersal capability. While farmland abandonment is increasing across marginal areas in the tropics, there remains a critical need to provide long-term management and protection from reconversion to maximize conservation benefits of secondary forests. Our study suggests such investments should be focused on land in close proximity to primary forests. Â© 2020 the authors.

We tested the hypothesis that both indices decrease over time as result of the environmental degradation. A decrease in the taxonomic richness and abundance was observed mainly of the inner zone. The functional structure remained relatively stable, but the functional originality decreased significantly between the two periods. This functional loss is of particular concern because the loss of species with unique treats may generate a series of ecosystem damage. This information tells us that the use of functional indices is essential to complement taxonomic assessments and to detect a more detailed understanding of the real dimension of biodiversity loss in impacted environments.

505,2020,"Refuges and ecological traps: extreme drought threatens persistence of an endangered fish in intermittent streams","Global Change Biology","Recent droughts raise global concern over potential biodiversity loss and mitigating impacts to vulnerable species has become a management priority. However, drought impacts on populations are difficult to predict, in part, because habitat refuges can buffer organisms from harsh environmental conditions. In a global change context, more extreme droughts may turn previously suitable habitats into ecological traps, where vulnerable species can no longer persist. Here, we explore the impacts of california's recent record-breaking drought on endangered juvenile coho salmon. We estimated the variability of cumulative salmon survival using markârecapture of nearly 20,000 tagged fish in intermittent stream pools during a 7-year period encompassing drought and non-drought conditions. We then determined the relative importance of physical habitat, streamflow, precipitation, landscape, and biological characteristics that may limit survival during drought. Our most striking result was an increase in the number of pools with reduced or zero survival during drought years and a coincident increase in spatial variability in survival among study reaches. In nearly half of the stream pools, salmon survival during drought was similar to mean survival of pools assessed during non-drought years, indicating some pools had remarkable resistance (ability to withstand disturbance) to extreme drought. Lower survival was most attributable to longer duration of disconnection between upstream and downstream habitats, a consequence of increasing drought severity. Our results not only suggest that many pools sustain juvenile salmon in non-drought years transition into ecological traps during drought but also highlight that some pools serve as refuges even under extreme drought conditions. Projected increases in drought severity that lead to longer droughts and greater habitat fragmentation could transform an increasing proportion of suitable habitats into ecological traps. Predicting future impacts of drought on coho salmon and other sensitive species will require identification and protection of drought refuges and management strategies that prevent further habitat fragmentation.

506,2020,"Assessment of long-term trends in fish distributions at multiple scales decreases uncertainty associated with historical datasets","Environmental Management","Monitoring long-term changes in aquatic biodiversity requires the effective use of historical data that were collected with different methods and varying levels of effort. Aggregating data into different spatial scales can control for such differences and provide a robust framework for monitoring distribution trends. We used a quantitative, multi-scale assessment to evaluate the potential drivers of distribution change for 60 fish species at three spatial scales, using 503 unique sampling events conducted between 1931 and 2019 in a stream biodiversity hotspot (french creek, pennsylvania, u.s.a). Trends delineated at multiple scales demonstrated that only one cyprinid species consistently declined through time. In contrast, several species, particularly centrarchids (bass and sunfish), appeared to increase with time. However, evidence for speciesâ increases varied among the different spatial scales, and our observations suggest that differences in effort and detection across time periods may contribute to patterns of species increases. There was agreement among scales that agricultural land use, non-native brown trout (salmo trutta), and anthropogenic barriers did not explain patterns in biodiversity change from the distribution trends in this study. The lack of species declines is likely due to the limited levels of historical impacts in the watershed compared with other locations in the region that experienced more acute pollution bottlenecks. Species increases were most prevalent for sportfish and baitfish species, suggesting that distribution increases were human mediated. Similar multi-scale assessments should provide more robust insight into patterns of biodiversity loss and distribution changes by maximizing the use of historical data.

507,2020,"Artisanal fisher perceptions on ghost nets in a tropical south atlantic marine biodiversity hotspot: challenges to traditional fishing culture and implications for conservation strategies: ghost net impacts: artisanal fisher perceptions and challenges to fishing culture","Ocean And Coastal Management","Ghost fishing, the ability of fishing equipment to continue to capture organisms even after it is no longer controlled, leads to serious marine impacts, including bycatch, which contributes to biodiversity loss. Insistent complaints from artisanal fisher in the state of bahia, brazil, concerning the impacts of nets lost or abandoned by fisher from other regions that operate in their traditional fishing territory were brought to the attention of our research group. Therefore, this study aims to describe the knowledge and classify fisher perceptions in south bahia regarding ghost fisheries in the region, as well as the resulting impacts and fisher ideas for solving this problem in a coastal coral reef region. Semi-structured interviews were conducted between august 2015 and september 2017 with 60 fishers, 59 men and one woman, that fish with hand lines and hooks in the studied area. A total of 90% of respondents (n = 54) reported having found ghost nets in their ancestral fishing territories, while 93% (n = 56) associated ghost nets with financial losses and marine environment impacts. Most respondents (n = 56; 93%) also indicated lower fishery yields due to ghost nets and indicated (n = 55; 91.9%) that most ghost nets found in the area are used for lobster fishing, which is banned in brazil. Fishers revealed an active interest in solving this socio-environmental problem, demonstrating detailed knowledge related to the loss of fishing nets in the local marine environment, as they have been finding and removing ghost nets from the local sea. Fisher's ideas to solve this problem included the implementation of fines for fishers caught in breach of regional and national fisheries regulations, and management actions, such as ghost net removal from the sea. Establishing partnerships between fisher and the federal government in curbing ghost fisheries is crucial.

508,2020,"Comparison of fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations in hand- versus parent-reared whooping cranes (grus americana)","Zoo Biology","Endangered whooping cranes (grus americana) have been produced in captivity for reintroduction programs since the 1980s, using techniques such as artificial insemination, multiple clutching, and captive-rearing to speed recovery efforts. Chicks are often hand-reared (hr) by caretakers in crane costumes, socialized into groups and released together, unlike parent-reared (pr) cranes that are raised individually by a male/female crane pair and released singly. Hr cranes historically exhibit greater morbidity rates during development than pr cranes, involving musculoskeletal and respiratory system disease, among others. We hypothesized that hr crane chicks exhibit a higher baseline fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fgm) concentrations during the development compared with pr chicks. Fecal samples were collected between 15 and 70 days of age from hr (n = 15) and pr (n = 8) chicks to test for differences in fgm concentrations using a radioimmunoassay technique following ethanol extraction for steroids. Linear mixed model analysis suggests increasing age of the chick was associated with an increase in fgm (p <.001). Analysis also supported the interaction between rearing strategy and sex of the crane chick (p <.01). Female pr chicks had greater fgm concentrations than all other groups (pr male, p <.01; hr female, p <.001; and hr male, p <.001). This result suggests that there may be an effect of rearing strategy on stress physiology of whooping crane chicks, especially among females. Further research is needed to investigate whether the fgm concentrations are reflective of true differences in stress physiology of young cranes and whether this may impact health and conservation success.

509,2020,"Hotspots of stream tadpole diversity in forest and agricultural landscapes in ranomafana, madagascar","Landscape And Ecological Engineering","Logging and human-induced conversion of natural forests into agricultural areas are major drivers of biodiversity loss in the tropics. Anuran larvae can be highly diverse, can reach high biomass and can play important roles in tropical streams; yet, compared to the adult frog communities, relatively little is known about how larval communities respond to disturbance. Information on larvae is highly relevant for amphibian conservation because larvae represent direct evidence of breeding and thus provide a good indicator of species persistence in disturbed habitats. We studied tadpole assemblages in ranomafana, southeastern part of madagascar, in streams in a disturbed forest (previously logged forest), at âforest edgeâ (streams embedded in matrix nearby forest blocks), and compared these to communities in a primary forest. We sampled tadpoles at the microhabitat level (âpoolsâ and ârifflesâ) in 9 streams. We recorded 27 species with a maximum of 17 species/stream recorded at edge. The three habitats harbored different assemblages, but, as could be expected, more similarities existed among forest habitats than between forest and non-forest habitats. The most and the least diverse communities were recorded at edge and in the disturbed forest, respectively. Assemblages were dominated by one generalist species, and changes in communities were mostly driven by changes in forest specialists, which either decreased in disturbed forest or were replaced by edge specialists outside forest. Although species richness varied, relative abundances were maintained among habitats, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms in tadpole biomass. Community structure changed at the microhabitat level: pool environments usually harbored relatively higher species richness and abundance than riffles. Our study highlights the relevance of edge habitats for maintaining amphibian diversity and the pronounced negative effects of past logging activities on tadpole communities. Given the diverse roles of tadpoles in streams, changes in community structure potentially affect critical stream ecosystem processes. The study has strong implications for designing buffer zones around protected areas.

510,2020,"Projected global loss of mammal habitat due to land-use and climate change","One Earth","Human pressure on the environment is driving a global decline of biodiversity. Anticipating whether this trend can be reverted under future scenarios is key to supporting policy decisions. We used the insights framework to model the impacts of land-use and climate change on future habitat availability for 2,827 terrestrial mammals at 15 arcmin resolution under five contrasting global scenarios based on combinations of representative concentration pathways and shared socio-economic pathways between 2015 and 2050. Mammal habitat declined globally by 5%â16% depending on the scenario. Africa (with declines up to 25%) and south america were the most affected regions. African insectivores, primates, australian carnivorous marsupials and marsupial moles, and south american opossums declined the most. Tackling this loss would require a mix of actions across scales, including a global shift toward sustainability, addressing land-use change in sub-saharan africa, and helping endemic species track climate change in south america. Human pressure is the main driver of modern biodiversity loss. Biodiversity and ecosystem services are universally agreed to be a precious resource for human societies and essential for human survival. Global scenarios of societal development can help us understand the implications of international policies on nations' abilities to secure access to food, energy, and resources, but they commonly ignore impacts on biodiversity. It is therefore essential that we be able to understand and anticipate the possible effects of these decisions on biodiversity. We find that a single strategy might have widely different impacts on biodiversity in different world regions. Also, seemingly valid strategies (from a societal perspective) could have serious negative repercussions on mammals, with expected losses of between 5% and 16%. A great deal of cooperation and more ambitious strategies than the ones currently being studied will be needed if we are to avoid the greatest impacts on the world's species. We used the insights framework to model impacts of land-use and climate change on future habitat for 2,827 terrestrial mammals under five contrasting global scenarios based on combinations of representative concentration pathways and shared socio-economic pathways, between 2015 and 2050. Mammal habitat declined globally by 5%â16% depending on the scenario and regionally up to 25%.

511,2020,"Vertebrates on the brink as indicators of biological annihilation and the sixth mass extinction","Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America","The ongoing sixth mass species extinction is the result of the destruction of component populations leading to eventual extirpation of entire species. Populations and species extinctions have severe implications for society through the degradation of ecosystem services. Here we assess the extinction crisis from a different perspective. We examine 29,400 species of terrestrial vertebrates, and determine which are on the brink of extinction because they have fewer than 1,000 individuals. There are 515 species on the brink (1.7% of the evaluated vertebrates). Around 94% of the populations of 77mammal and bird species on the brink have been lost in the last century. Assuming all species on the brink have similar trends, more than 237,000 populations of those species have vanished since 1900. We conclude the human-caused sixth mass extinction is likely accelerating for several reasons. First, many of the species that have been driven to the brink will likely become extinct soon. Second, the distribution of those species highly coincides with hundreds of other endangered species, surviving in regions with high human impacts, suggesting ongoing regional biodiversity collapses. Third, close ecological interactions of species on the brink tend to move other species toward annihilation when they disappear-extinction breeds extinctions. Finally, human pressures on the biosphere are growing rapidly, and a recent example is the current coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, linked to wildlife trade. Our results reemphasize the extreme urgency of taking much-expanded worldwide actions to save wild species and humanity's crucial life-support systems from this existential threat.

512,2020,"Artificial refuges to combat habitat loss for an endangered marsupial predator: how do they measure up?","Conservation Science And Practice","One technique used to combat the growing global species extinction crisis has been to create artificial refugesâhuman-made replacements for natural refuges destroyed during habitat modification. However, there is limited knowledge of how closely artificial refuges replicate the natural refuges they seek to replace. Mining threatens many species worldwide through large-scale habitat modification, and artificial refuges have been proposed as a method to offset the resulting habitat loss. Here, we examined the microclimatic, physical, and biotic characteristics of natural dens occupied by the northern quoll (dasyurus hallucatus)âan endangered marsupial threatened by habitat lossâand compared these to (a) superficially similar unoccupied crevices, and (b) artificial dens created by mining companies for northern quolls. Northern quolls occupied natural dens that were cooler and deeper than unoccupied crevices, likely to avoid lethal air temperatures as well as predators. Artificial dens provided similar thermal properties to occupied dens, but lacked key characteristics in having shallower den cavities, less complex surrounding habitat, increased feral cat visitation, and less small mammal prey compared to occupied dens. This study highlights the need to consider multiple facets when constructing artificial refuges, in order to avoid perverse outcomes, such as inadequate shelter, increased predation, and food shortages.

513,2020,"Culture and the social-ecology of local food use by indigenous communities in northern north america","Ecology And Society","Social-ecological and biocultural systems connect people to their environment at the intersection of nature and culture. The harvest of local wildlife for human consumption is critically important to the food security of the worldâs indigenous peoples and to the conservation of biodiversity, either as a driver of biodiversity loss or of biodiversity protection, depending on system properties. By their nature, local food systems are assumed to be both ecologically determined and culturally defined. Here, we analyze standardized local food consumption surveys conducted in 21 indigenous communities across northern north america. Using measures of dietary similarity from the ecological sciences and a variance partitioning statistical approach, we reveal a profound and prevailing importance of culture in defining the types and amounts of animal species consumed as food, operating within the environmental constraint of local availability. This quantitative, multicommunity analysis reveals the sustainability and cultural agency inherent in local food systems and the importance of cultural-ecological coupling in an era of accelerating social and environmental change.

Here we present a real-world example where tactics (techniques which influence post-release performance and persistence) and an adaptive management framework (which incorporates feedback between monitoring and future actions) improved reintroduction success. Across three successive trials we investigated the influence of tactics on the effective survival and post-release dispersal of endangered eastern quolls (dasyurus viverrinus) reintroduced into mulligans flat woodland sanctuary, australian capital territory. Founders were monitored for 42 days post-release, and probability of survival and post-release dispersal were tested against trial, origin, sex, den sharing and presence of pouch young. We adopted an adaptive management framework, using monitoring to facilitate rapid learning and to implement interventions that improved reintroduction success. Founders released in the first trial were less likely to survive (28.6%, n = 14) than those founders released the second (76.9%, n = 13) and third trials (87.5%, n = 8). We adapted several tactics in the second and third trials, including the selection of female-only founders to avoid elevated male mortality, and post-mating releases to reduce stress. Founders that moved dens between consecutive nights were less likely to survive, suggesting that minimising post-release dispersal can increase the probability of survival. The probability of moving dens was lower in the second and third trials, for females, and when den sharing with another founder. This study demonstrates that, through iterative trials of tactics involving monitoring and learning, adaptive management can be used to significantly improve the success of reintroduction programs.

515,2020,"Opportunities for prioritizing and expanding conservation enterprise in india using a guild of carnivores as flagships","Environmental Research Letters","Conservation interventions in developing countries are frequently thwarted by socio-economic agendas, severely limiting the scope and rigor of biodiversity and habitat conservation. Very few ecological assessments incorporate human interests in conservation prioritization, creating asynchrony between planning and implementation. For conservation actions to be logistically feasible, multiple criteria including ecological, social, economic and administrative aspects must be considered. Understanding how these different dimensions interact spatially is also important for gauging the potential for conservation success. Here, we use a guild of select mammalian carnivores (wild canids and hyenas) in india to (i) generate distribution maps at the spatial scale of administrative sub-districts, that are relevant to management, (ii) examine ecological, social and biogeographic factors associated with their distribution, assess key threats, and identify areas important for their conservation, (iii) use prioritization tools for balancing habitat conservation, human needs and economic growth, and (iv) evaluate the spatial congruence between areas with high conservation potential, and areas currently in focus for protection efforts, conservation investments, and infrastructure development. We find that the current protected area system does not adequately cover or represent diverse habitats, that there is immense potential for states to increase financial investments towards alternative conservation strategies, and, most infrastructure projects may be potentially jeopardizing important carnivore habitats where the two overlap. Our framework allowed for identifying locations where conservation investments would lead to the highest benefits for carnivores as flagships, which also benefit other species across habitats. We make a case for re-evaluating how large-scale prioritization assessments are made, and for broadening the purview of conservation policies in india and other developing countries.

516,2020,"Ungulates and ecosystem services in mediterranean woody systems: a semi-quantitative review","Journal For Nature Conservation","Ungulates are key elements that modulate the type and direction of ecosystem services in mediterranean environments. Our main objective is to synthesize the provision of ecosystem services in forests, shrublands and woodlands dominated by ungulates (wildlife or livestock) in mediterranean environments. To achieve this objective, we performed a systematic semi-quantitative review (n = 262 studies) across the mediterranean climate area for the 1991â2018 period. Most studies focused on supporting services (80.35 % of all studies), with biodiversity (49.11 %) and plant recruitment (18.15 %) as the most studied services. A great number of studies addressed plant biodiversity preservation (63.40 % of studies on biodiversity). Surprisingly, we found a low number of studies on cultural (7.02 %) and regulatory (5.26 %) services. Regarding the direction of the relationship of ungulate effects on ecosystem services, 67 studies (25.57 %) showed positive effects and 86 studies (32.82 %) mentioned negative effects (disservices). Most studies that showed positive effects focused on biodiversity, mainly vegetation and birds, and wildfire prevention. However, most studies reporting negative effects were also based on biodiversity loss (mainly vegetation) and plant recruitment failure. Distribution of services remained similar across regions and species but positive effects of ungulates were reported mainly in shrublands and negative effects were reported primarily in forests and woodlands. Despite the fact that ungulate density is key to explain the direction of ungulate effects on ecosystem services, only 9.51 % of all studies considered different estimates of herbivore pressure and just 7.22 % of all studies considered different contrasted densities in the analysis. Overall, our analysis of services showed a decreasing tolerance to ungulate pressure from woodlands, through forests, to shrublands. Mean â± se ungulate densities (livestock units per ha) in studies that showed negative effects were 0.20 â± 0.01 in shrublands, 0.22 â± 0.01 in forests, and 1.98 â± 1.70 in woodlands (including dehesas, montados and rangelands). Management in mediterranean woody ecosystems should focus on neglected services (e.g. Regulatory services) and try to adjust ungulate population densities to maximize positive effects and minimize negative effects on ecosystem services.

517,2020,"River dams and the stability of bird communities: a hierarchical bayesian analysis in a tropical hydroelectric power plant","Journal Of Applied Ecology","The effects of anthropogenic disturbance upon the stability of wildlife communities depend on the heterogeneity and connectivity of habitat remnants on multiple scales. The number of hydroelectric dams in biodiversity hotspots (africa, south america and asia) is growing rapidly. To establish their environmental impact, it is essential to understand the dynamics of wildlife communities before and following the establishment of dams. We evaluated the impacts of the filling of the serra do facão hydroelectric reservoir in the são marcos river, central brazil, on the bird community. Using data from 1,145 surveys across 20 sampling sites over 8â years, 2â years before and 6â years after the filling of the reservoir, we assessed the resistance, i.e. Maintenance close to an equilibrium state during the disturbance, and resilience, i.e. Ability to return to the original state following the disturbance, of the bird community. We used spatiotemporal hierarchical bayesian models to assess the effects of reservoir filling on five community parameters: abundance, richness, phylogenetic diversity, functional diversity and species composition. In the period subsequent to reservoir filling, there was (a) a marked reduction in bird abundance, richness, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity, and (b) a reduction in the proportion of forest species, coupled with an increase in the proportion of savanna species. Except for bird abundance, none of the other community attributes returned to their original levels, even after 6â years. Our findings indicate that cerrado bird communities have both low resistance and low resilience to habitat loss associated with the establishment of hydroelectric reservoirs. Synthesis and applications. The environmental costs of hydroelectric dams are still underestimated or neglected in brazil. A new paradigm in the assessment of their environmental impacts is warranted, incorporating (a) models of spatiotemporal variations based on long-term monitoring with surveys initiated before disturbances and (b) measures of functional and phylogenetic diversity, such that society can understand the costs and benefits of the establishment of new hydroelectric dams and make informed decisions. Biodiversity loss could be minimized by ensuring the preservation and connectivity of alluvial habitats, capable of maintaining the supply of resources and the functional and phylogenetic attributes of bird communities associated with such habitats.

518,2020,"Exploring connections among the multiple outputs and outcomes emerging from 25 years of sea turtle conservation in northern cyprus","Journal For Nature Conservation","Monitoring and evaluation is an essential stage of conservation implementation, offering a wide variety of benefits including the ability to engage in informed adaptive management. Understanding the relationship among actions, outputs, and outcomes can inform on factors acting to facilitate or hinder conservation success. Assessing these relationships is particularly important for projects with both social and ecological objectives given that they likely operate through a more complex theory of change. Performance measurement studies that assess both ecological and social variables can offer an informative and cost-effective evaluation method for such projects, but simultaneous social-ecological evaluation is rarely implemented. Using the case study of the marine turtle conservation project in north cyprus, we aimed to demonstrate how social-ecological performance measure protocols can aid sea turtle conservation efforts in adaptive management through informing on connections among project actions, outputs, and outcomes. Our study employed a mixed-methods performance measurement approach integrating three distinct data sources: 31 project publications, the project's long-term dataset on sea turtle ecology, and 26 semi-structured interviews with key informants including residents, fishermen, local business owners, and project staff. The results indicated that the project has generated a wide range of social, economic, and ecological outcomes. Two primary connections among social and ecological factors emerged: 1) bridging the research-implementation gap through directing research into policy action and 2) enhanced operational capacity and achievement of ecological outcomes through extensively engaging with the community and generating local economic benefits. Insufficient government enforcement and a lack of widespread behavioural change on turtle nesting beaches were primary barriers. This study highlights the benefits of multi-disciplinary conservation and demonstrates the insight that can be gained from rapid, social-ecological performance measurement approaches. Channelling such information back into conservation through adaptive management can serve to both increase the achievement of ecological goals and improve human wellbeing.

519,2020,"Alternative pathways to a sustainable future lead to contrasting biodiversity responses","Global Ecology And Conservation","Land-use change is currently the main driver of biodiversity loss. Projections of land-use change are often used to estimate potential impacts on biodiversity of future pathways of human development. However, such analyses frequently neglect that species can persist in human-modified habitats. Our aim was to estimate changes in biodiversity, considering affinities for multiple habitats, for three different land-use scenarios. Two scenarios focused on more sustainable trajectories of land-use change, based on either technological improvements (pathway a) or societal changes (pathway b), and the third reflected the historical or business-as-usual trends (pathway 0). Using portugal as a case study, we produced spatially-explicit projections of land-use change based on these pathways, and then we assessed the resulting changes in bird species richness and composition projected to occur by 2050 in each of the scenarios. By 2050, alpha and gamma diversity were projected to decrease, relative to 2010, in pathway 0 and increase in pathways a and b. However, different pathways favored different species groups, and presented strong regional differences. In the technological improvement pathway, loss of extensive agricultural areas led to an increase in both natural and extensive forest areas. In this pathway, forest species increase at the expense of farmland species, while in the societal change pathway the reverse occurs, as extensive agricultural areas were projected to increase. We show that while multiple positive pathways (a and b) for biodiversity can be envisioned, they will lead to differential impacts on biodiversity depending on the transformational changes in place and the regional socio-economic context. Our results suggest that considering compositional aspects of biodiversity can be critical in choosing the appropriate regional land-use policies.

520,2020,"Characterizing tourism benefits associated with top-predator conservation in coastal british columbia","Aquatic Conservation: Marine And Freshwater Ecosystems","Facing public concern over costs related to top-predator reintroductions and conservation, ecosystem services such as ecotourism are often used to evoke benefits that outweigh or offset those costs. Quantifying these benefits using rigorous scientific methods can provide confidence to policymakers and other stakeholders that predators can in fact deliver positive outcomes to people living alongside them. The evaluation of these benefits is often anecdotal or qualitative, however, and empirical quantifications are rare. In coastal marine ecosystems, sea otter reintroduction is seen as a conservation success to some but a bane to others. The contribution of sea otters (enyhdra lutris) to tourism revenue is touted as a crucial ecosystem service benefit to offset the loss of shellfish harvesting and associated revenue, but remains unquantified, weakening the favourable reception of conservation action. The potential economic benefits of sea otters associated with tourism and the extent to which benefits are realized were evaluated based on: (i) choice-experiment surveys of tourists; and (ii) interviews with tourism operators in british columbia. Sea otters were a strong factor in people's choices regarding wildlife viewing, and sea otters could have large benefits for local economies. Alongside socio-economic characteristics, tourism experience influences touristsâ preferences. Tourism operators did not perceive sea otters as strongly influencing tourist choice, highlighting the gap that can occur between the perception and the reality of tourist preferences, leading to missed opportunities for the alignment of economic development with conservation actions.

521,2020,"Morphological traits mediate fish occurrences in oil palm-impacted tropical streams","Freshwater Biology","Land-use change is a leading driver of biodiversity loss, especially in tropical fresh waters where the conversion of natural forest to monoculture plantations impacts freshwater fish assemblages. The environmental pathways underpinning shifts in fish assemblages, however, are poorly understood, but could potentially be inferred from traitâenvironment relationships. We addressed this knowledge gap using eco-morphological traits to explain fish occurrences in oil palm-impacted streams of the endau drainage in peninsular malaysia. We also investigated how traits relate to differences in environmental conditions associated with land-use change. We then integrate findings from the above to test how potential pathways of land-use driven environmental changes can impact species occurrences through effects on life history, feeding habits, and mobility. Mixed-effects models show that fishes with superior (upward-facing) mouths and low body mass were more likely to occur in oil palm streams than forest streams, and these traits were associated with grass-dominated riparian zones and reduced woody debris in oil palm streams, respectively. Structural equation models show that mouth positions statistically mediated the effect of riparian vegetation on fish species occurrences in oil palm streams. Specifically, fishes with superior mouths were more likely to feed on terrestrial invertebrates. Our analysis of easily measurable traits revealed pathways of land-use impact that are potentially more widely applicable than conventional taxa-based approaches. Fishes with superior mouths tended to occur in oil palm streams as they were able to more effectively exploit inputs of terrestrial invertebrates that are potentially associated with grass-dominated riparian vegetation. Moreover, shifts in traits may suggest land-use driven changes in stream ecosystem functioning (e.g. In terms of the role of terrestrial subsidies), thereby informing targeted management actions in land-use impacted habitats (e.g. Retention/restoration of riparian trees).

However, while only a fraction of the global biodiversity is known, its current decline is unprecedented, making biodiversity hotspots a conservation priority. The sierra gorda biodiversity reserve (sgbr) in central mexico is known for its rich biodiversity. It is an example of the juxtaposition between species discovery and extinction: aquatic species richness is mostly unknown as no efforts have investigated aquatic communities so far, but are already anthropogenically stressed. We hypothesized that invasive species are already well established in various protected areas and investigated this by assessing the threat of invasive species that are already established within the sgbr on the native biodiversity. By combining field sampling with peer-reviewed literature and local reports, we identify the presence of various non-native species in sgbr. Among these non-native species identified were opportunistic predatory fish and potentially-pathogen transmitting molluscs, but also, a habitat engineer capable of modifying ecosystem functions. Moreover, we highlight that these species were introduced despite legislation and without any knowledge among authorities. As a result, we underline the necessity to describe native species, control invasive and prevent the introduction of further non-native species. If accelerated action is not taken, we risk losing a considerable amount of described and unknown freshwater biota.

523,2020,"Bison limit ecosystem recovery in northern yellowstone","Food Webs","American bison (bison bison) numbers in northern yellowstone national park increased during the last two decades, while those of elk (cervus canadensis) decreased. We undertook this to study to assess the potential effects of bison on woody vegetation and channel morphology in the park's northern ungulate winter range. Based on differences in the number of elk and bison, body mass, and the amount of time each utilizes the northern range, foraging pressure from bison began to exceed that of elk in 2007 and is currently ~10 times greater than that of elk. In the lamar valley study area, stand structure data (i.e., tree frequency by diameter class) for aspen (populus tremuloides) and cottonwood (p. Spp.) Indicated that the growth of seedling/sprouts of these species into tall saplings and trees has been extensively suppressed by bison herbivory. For streams that crossed the valley floor, woody riparian vegetation was absent along their banks and channels were relatively wide and deep, conditions sustained by high levels of bison use. Overall, our findings indicated that the elevated numbers of bison, via herbivory, trampling, and tree bark effects, are limiting the structure, composition, and distribution of woody plant communities in the lamar valley, affecting the character of the valley's stream and river channels, and, in turn, influencing habitat and food-web support for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife species. The conservation success of bison recovery now may be adversely affecting another conservation goal, the restoration and maintenance of woody riparian vegetation and riparian ecosystems.

524,2020,"Epizootics and sanitary regulations drive long-term changes in fledgling body condition of a threatened vulture","Ecological Indicators","Epizootics and deliberate changes in policies affecting the environment may affect large groups of species and the functioning of entire ecosystems. Although these effects often overlap in time, their simultaneous effect is rarely examined despite their importance as causes of current biodiversity loss. Here, based on the monitoring of an egyptian vulture (neophron percnopterus) population over thirty-three years (1986â2018), we increase our knowledge about the effects of anthropogenic-induced changes in food availability, both direct (sanitary policies limiting livestock carcass disposal) and indirect (a wild rabbit epizootic), on brood size and body condition of fledglings at nests. We compared the body mass of fledglings of broods with one chick (single) and two chicks (within which we distinguished first and second-hatched). The mass of second-hatched chicks decreased after the plummet in rabbit populations (in the year 1990) and the regulations limiting carcass disposal (2005), reaching minimum values during the period with lowest food availability (i.e. 2005â2013). Recent sanitary legislation allowing carcass disposal by farmers coincides with a slight recovery in the observed body masses. Overall, this study shows that environmental changes of disparate origin can have synergistic effects on individual condition.

525,2020,"Fishery bycatch is among the most important threats to the european population of greater scaup aythya marila","Bird Conservation International","For greater scaup aythya marila, classified as 'vulnerable' on the european red list of birds, the south-western baltic sea is one of the most important wintering sites in europe. In this area, a large concentration of gillnet fishery temporally overlaps periods of the most abundant occurrence of foraging diving birds. The aim of the article is to show how bycatch can impact the population of a diving duck. To assess this, we calculate the potential biological removal (pbr) for the studied greater scaup population and we model the population change according to age-structured matrix models. Summing all the available recent figures on greater scaup bycatch in north-west europe yields an estimated mean annual total of 3,991 individuals (2% of the flyway population). For a baseline stable population, an age-structured matrix model indicates that at this bycatch level the greater scaup population that winters in north-west europe will decrease by 36% over the next 30 years, qualifying the status of the population as 'vulnerable' according to iucn criteria. As this population also experiences decline prior to bycatch, this decrease will be 57%, which qualifies the status as 'endangered'. Pbr as an indicator of population vitality does not work in our case because the pbr-informed allowable bycatch values have a significantly negative impact on the population. Our results indicate unambiguously that fishery bycatch is among the most important threats responsible for the greater scaup's decline. While recent data suggest that some improvement has taken place in the species' status over the last 10 years, measures to protect greater scaup from bycatch are required. The solution should involve the prohibition of gillnet fishing in selected key sites and the use of mitigation techniques in other areas.

526,2020,"Cold war spy satellite images reveal long-term declines of a philopatric keystone species in response to cropland expansion","Proceedings Of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","Agricultural expansion drives biodiversity loss globally, but impact assessments are biased towards recent time periods. This can lead to a gross underestimation of species declines in response to habitat loss, especially when species declines are gradual and occur over long time periods. Using cold war spy satellite images (corona), we show that a grassland keystone species, the bobak marmot (marmota bobak), continues to respond to agricultural expansion that happened more than 50 years ago. Although burrow densities of the bobak marmot today are highest in croplands, densities declined most strongly in areas that were persistently used as croplands since the 1960s. This response to historical agricultural conversion spans roughly eight marmot generations and suggests the longest recorded response of a mammal species to agricultural expansion. We also found evidence for remarkable philopatry: nearly half of all burrows retained their exact location since the 1960s, and this was most pronounced in grasslands. Our results stress the need for farsighted decisions, because contemporary land management will affect biodiversity decades into the future. Finally, our work pioneers the use of corona historical cold war spy satellite imagery for ecology. This vastly underused global remote sensing resource provides a unique opportunity to expand the time horizon of broad-scale ecological studies.

527,2020,"Factors affecting the detection of an imperiled and cryptic species","Diversity","Population surveying and monitoring are important for identifying conservation needs and tracking trends in populations, communities, and ecosystems over time and laying the groundwork for conservation management and policy decisions. If species or populations go undetected because of inadequate effort or sampling design, protection and management cannot be properly provided. Due to the widespread loss of populations, the eastern massasauga (a rattlesnake) was recently listed as a federally threatened species in the united states; it is also listed as threatened in canada. Given its current conservation status, there is considerable interest at state and federal levels in determining how to best survey for eastern massasaugas to aid in management decisions. Using a 16-year dataset, we examined the relationships among environmental, temporal, area, management, and search effort factors on the detection probability of eastern massasaugas. We found that four abiotic parameters (solar irradiance, shaded air temperature, three-day maximum air temperature, and humidity) and three search parameters (effort per researcher, search area, and search time of day) influenced detection of eastern massasaugas. As the current biodiversity crisis continues, the cost-effective use of resources and scientific expertise will continue to increase in importance. We hope our results stimulate similar analyses in other taxa, which will be critical for designing and implementing regional survey and monitoring programs.

528,2020,"Global opportunities and challenges for transboundary conservation","Nature Ecology And Evolution","Rapid biodiversity loss has prompted global action to prevent further declines, yet coordinated conservation action among nations remains elusive. As a result, species with ranges that span international bordersâwhich include 53.8% of terrestrial birds, mammals and amphibiansâare in increasing peril through uncoordinated management and artificial barriers to human movement, such as border fences. Transboundary conservation initiatives represent a unique opportunity to better protect species through coordinated management across national borders. Using metrics of governance, collaboration and human pressure, we provide an index of transboundary conservation feasibility to assess global opportunities and challenges for different nations. While the transboundary conservation potential of securing multinational threatened species varied substantially, there are distinct opportunities in south-east asia, northern europe, north america and south america. But to successfully avert the loss of transboundary species, the global community must be prepared to invest in some regions facing greater implementation challenges, including the nations of central africa, where efforts may necessitate establishing rapid conservation interventions postconflict that align with local socio-cultural opportunities and constraints. Sanctioned and coordinated approaches towards managing transboundary species are now essential to prevent further declines of many endangered species, and global policy efforts must do more to produce and enact legitimate mechanisms for collaborative action in conservation.

529,2020,"An interview-based approach assessing interactions between seals and small-scale fisheries informs the conservation strategy of the endangered mediterranean monk seal","Aquatic Conservation: Marine And Freshwater Ecosystems","Small-scale fisheries may pose a serious threat to the conservation of marine mammals. At the same time various factors have led to the decline of small-scale fisheries, often making them unsustainable. Current rates of biodiversity loss and the reduction of fish stocks and fisheries dictate a thorough understanding of fisheries-related issues and the implementation of effective management actions. The mediterranean monk seal is one of the most endangered marine mammals on earth; its survival in the eastern mediterranean sea is threatened by negative interactions with fisheries. A nationwide questionnaire survey among fishers and port police authorities was carried out in greece to describe the main characteristics of small-scale fisheries, and to understand the nature and assess the magnitude of negative interactions between the monk seal and these fisheries. Questionnaire information was verified by a second round of interviews during landings. The main attributes of the fishers, their fishing boats, and their practices were characteristic of the small-scale fisheries sector. Overfishing was considered the main reason for fish-stock reduction, and negative interactions with marine mammals was considered the main issue for the fishing sector. Monk seals were present, caused damage, and got accidentally entangled in fishing gear throughout greece. Damage to fishing gear was recorded mainly during spring and summer, and on average affected 21% of all fishing trips and 1% of nets deployed during a fishing trip. Based on these results, the implementation of general and specific nationwide fishery management and conservation actions are proposed. These actions are mainly aimed at improving fish stock status, changing the behaviour of the fishers, and mitigating sealâfishery interactions in greece, while promoting the recovery of the mediterranean monk seal in the eastern mediterranean sea.

This listing now requires cites parties to issue import and export permits and to closely monitor international trade in mako products. In this paper, three core arguments are being revisited that were uttered against a listing of the mako shark: that it is not scientifically justifiable; that it will cause implementation problems and will have limited conservation success; and that regional fisheries management organisations (rfmos) are better suited to manage mako sharks. It is concluded that while the mako is not yet endangered globally, the precautionary approach justifies its listing. At the same time, although there will in all likelihood be implementation problems, the overall effect of the listing will be positive. Lastly, given their limited scope and focus on utilisation of economically valuable species, rfmos are not well-suited for the conservation of mako sharks.

The national audubon society runs the plants for birds and the humminbirds at home programs that, like others, recommend homeowners to establish diverse assemblages of native plants with supplemental feeders. Here, we use plant and hummingbird data from the hummingbirds at home program to determine whether common wildlife-gardening recommendations correlate with intended outcomes. Our results showed that, after statistically controlling for several variables related to observer effort and geography, the relative occurrence and relative frequency of hummingbird sightings during patch surveys was positively related to the (1) presence of hummingbird feeders in a patch, (2) number of nectar-provisioning flowering-plant taxa in a patch, (3) degree to which nectar-provisioning flowering-plants in a patch were endemic to the conterminous usa, and (4) lack of impervious surface (a common proxy for urban development) in the surrounding landscape. These results support previous studies that showed how recommendations from wildlife-gardening programs associate with intended outcomes, but do so across an exceptionally broad, national extent that varies enormously in physical and biological geography.

532,2020,"Evolutionary history of neotropical savannas geographically concentrates species, phylogenetic and functional diversity of lizards","Journal Of Biogeography","Aim: understanding where and why species diversity is geographically concentrated remains a challenge in biogeography and macroevolution. This is true for the cerrado, the most biodiverse tropical savanna in the world, which has experienced profound biodiversity loss. Previous studies have focused onâ a single metric (species composition), neglecting the fact that âspeciesâ within the biome are often composed of cryptic species. In order to identify biodiversity hotspots more robustly and across multiple dimensions we integrate functional, spatial and new phylogeographic data for the cerrado lizard fauna by (a) mapping the spatial patterns of species and phylogenetic diversity; and (b) using endemism measures to identify areas of unique diversity. We then quantify the extent to which existing protected areas represent the diversity. Location: brazilian savanna (cerrado). Methods: we generated species distribution models using distribution records for all cerrado lizard species. These, combined with mitochondrial dna phylogenies and natural history data, allowed us to map species richness, phylogenetic and functional diversity and phylogenetic and weighted endemism. Phylogenetic endemism maps were then cross-referenced against protected areas to calculate the amount of evolutionary history preserved within these areas. Results: the central region of the cerrado, a vast and climatically stable plateau, stands out as important under all biodiversity metrics. Including evolutionary relationships in biodiversity assessment, we detected four regional hotspots with high concentration of spatially restricted evolutionary diversity. Protected areas cover only 10% of the cerrado area and hold 11.64% of the summed phylogenetic endemism of all lizards in the biome. Main conclusions: we highlighted both stable (chapada dos veadeiros and serra do espinhaão plateaus) and environmentally heterogenous regions (araguaia and tocantins valleys) as hotspots of evolutionary diversity. The creation and/or manipulation of areas for conservation are essential for the conservation and survival of the rich and endemic lizard fauna of the cerrado.

The number of blue cranes in the overberg increased from mean density of 47.3 to 204.7 birds 100 kmâ1 in the summer breeding season, and in the swartland from 7.5 to 34.2 birds 100 kmâ1. In both regions, agriculture has resulted in extensive transformation of the original renosterveld and fynbos vegetation (shaw 2003). Results show dramatic population increases in these two regions, following a major decline in populations in the grassland biome (mccann 2000) where there has also been land transformation. Roadcounts conducted during the breeding season proved more effective in indicating population trends than those during the non-breeding season when birds aggregate in flocks.

Since the birth of the modern environmental movement in the 1960s, there has been growing scientific and political acknowledgement of there being a global environmental crisis, which today manifests itself as a climate change and biodiversity crisis. This calls for a multi-scale ecosemiotic approach to analysis of human ecology at various levels and scales. In this article i explore to what extent ecosemiotic methodology, drawing on umwelt theory and its consistently subjective perspective, can be applied in analysis of human ecology at different geographical and ecological scales ranging from the global to the local. The article incorporates a case study of humanâanimal relations in mamirauã sustainable development reserve in the central amazon. This is a seasonal floodplain forest area surrounded by rivers. I investigate aspects of the living conditions and ecology of the reserve, with a main focus on indigenous communities and the circumstances of two primate species, namely the red howler monkey (alouatta seniculus) and the black-headed squirrel monkey (saimiri vanzolinii). I outline matrixes of levels of study in ecosemiotics, and scales in human ecology, and apply two scales to the mamirauã case. These take an individual animalâs and an individual human beingâs subjective experience as their respectively starting points.

535,2020,"Distance to forest, mammal and bird dispersal drive natural regeneration on degraded tropical peatland","Forest Ecology And Management","Restoration of peat swamp forest (psf) on degraded southeast asian peatlands could reduce global carbon emissions and biodiversity loss. However, multiple ecological barriers are believed to hinder natural regeneration of native trees on degraded peatland and make restoration expensive. We evaluated if natural psf regeneration occurs and what factors may influence it on eight different land use and land cover (lulc) classes with different types of disturbance, including drainage and fire, in a retired acacia crassicarpa benth. (Acacia) plantation landscape. The study involved 42 plots inside five psf lulcs â intact, logged, burnt (1997, 2015), remnant and 212 plots at distances up to 2 km from the psf edge in three acacia plantation lulcs â unharvested, harvested, and burnt. The number of species per plot were similar between intact psf (25 â± 6 (sd) per 20 m ã 10 m plot), logged forest (30 â± 6) and 1997 burnt forest (30 â± 13) but lower in 2015 burnt forest (11 â± 10) and remnant forest (18 â± 11). Regeneration away from the psf across all degraded lulcs varied from fern dominated areas with no regeneration to clusters with high stem densities. The plantation lulcs, unharvested (94 species) and harvested acacia (71 species), had similar overall species diversity after 3â4 years of regeneration to the intact and logged psf (90 species). In unharvested acacia, total species diversity, species per plot and stem density decreased with distance from forest edge (1â300 m â 87 species; 9 â± 6 (sd) species per 20 m ã 10 m plot; 1,056 stems/ha; 301â500 m â 33; 5 â± 2; 511 and >500 m â 38; 6 â± 3; 683). In harvested acacia, there was low plot species diversity irrespective of distance from the forest (1â300 m â 51; 4 â± 2; 578; 301â500 m â 17; 4 â± 2; 1,100; >500 m â 48; 4 â± 2; 780). Factors which may influence regeneration differed between different lulcs, but there was a clear influence of distance from forest edge and dispersal mechanism â i.e. Whether a tree was bird or mammal dispersed and the interaction between these two factors. While our study suggests that if not further disturbed by logging, drainage and/or fire, degraded psf could regenerate naturally to a similar species diversity as intact psf, the lower levels of natural regeneration further away from the forest may warrant selective planting of species which do not disperse over long distances. More study is needed on the factors facilitating natural regeneration, whether it leads to restoration of psf ecosystem functioning and the role of acacia as a potential regeneration catalyst.

536,2020,"Land-sharing vs. Land-sparing urban development modulate predatorâprey interactions in europe","Ecological Applications","Urban areas are expanding globally as a consequence of human population increases, with overall negative effects on biodiversity. To prevent the further loss of biodiversity, it is urgent to understand the mechanisms behind this loss to develop evidence-based sustainable solutions to preserve biodiversity in urban landscapes. The two extreme urban development types along a continuum, land-sparing (large, continuous green areas and high-density housing) and land-sharing (small, fragmented green areas and low-density housing) have been the recent focus of debates regarding the pattern of urban development. However, in this context, there is no information on the mechanisms behind the observed biodiversity changes. One of the main mechanisms proposed to explain urban biodiversity loss is the alteration of predatorâprey interactions. Using ground-nesting birds as a model system and data from nine european cities, we experimentally tested the effects of these two extreme urban development types on artificial ground nest survival and whether nest survival correlates with the local abundance of ground-nesting birds and their nest predators. Nest survival (nâ =â 554) was lower in land-sharing than in land-sparing urban areas. Nest survival decreased with increasing numbers of local predators (cats and corvids) and with nest visibility. Correspondingly, relative abundance of ground-nesting birds was greater in land-sparing than in land-sharing urban areas, though overall bird species richness was unaffected by the pattern of urban development. We provide the first evidence that predatorâprey interactions differ between the two extreme urban development types. Changing interactions may explain the higher proportion of ground-nesting birds in land-sparing areas, and suggest a limitation of the land-sharing model. Nest predator control and the provision of more green-covered urban habitats may also improve conservation of sensitive birds in cities. Our findings provide information on how to further expand our cities without severe loss of urban-sensitive species and give support for land-sparing over land-sharing urban development.

537,2020,"A bayesian hierarchical approach to quantifying stakeholder attitudes toward conservation in the presence of reporting error","Conservation Biology","Stakeholder support is vital for achieving conservation success, yet there are few reliable mechanisms to monitor stakeholder attitudes toward conservation. Approaches used to assess attitudes rarely account for bias arising from reporting error, which can lead to falsely reporting a positive attitude toward conservation (false-positive error) or not reporting a positive attitude when the respondent has a positive attitude toward conservation (false-negative error). Borrowing from developments in applied conservation science, we used a bayesian hierarchical model to quantify stakeholder attitudes as the probability of having a positive attitude toward wildlife notionally (or in abstract terms) and at localized scales while accounting for reporting error. We compared estimates from our model, likert scores, and naãve estimates (i.e., proportion of respondents reporting a positive attitude in at least 1 question that was only susceptible to false-negative error) with true stakeholder attitudes through simulations. We then applied the model in a survey of tea estate staff on their attitudes toward asian elephants (elephas maximus) in the kazirangaâkarbi anglong landscape of northeast india. In simulations, bayesian model estimates of stakeholder attitudes toward wildlife were less biased than naãve estimates or likert scores. After accounting for reporting errors, we estimated the probability of having a positive attitude toward elephants notionally as 0.85 in the kaziranga landscape, whereas the proportion of respondents who had positive attitudes toward elephants at a localized scale was 0.50. In comparison, without accounting for reporting errors, naãve estimates of proportions of respondents with positive attitudes toward elephants were 0.69 and 0.23 notionally and at local scales, respectively. False (positive and negative) reporting probabilities were consistently not 0 (0.22â0.68). Regular and reliable assessment of stakeholder attitudesâcombined with inference on drivers of positive attitudesâcan help assess the success of initiatives aimed at facilitating human behavioral change and inform conservation decision making.

538,2020,"Changes in the diet and body size of a small herbivorous mammal (hispid cotton rat, sigmodon hispidus) following the late pleistocene megafauna extinction","Ecography","The catastrophic loss of large-bodied mammals during the terminal pleistocene likely led to cascading effects within communities. While the extinction of the top consumers probably expanded the resources available to survivors of all body sizes, little work has focused on the responses of the smallest mammals. Here, we use a detailed fossil record from the southwestern united states to examine the response of the hispid cotton rat sigmodon hispidus to biodiversity loss and climatic change over the late quaternary. In particular, we focus on changes in diet and body size. We characterize diet through carbon (î13c) and nitrogen (î15n) isotope analysis of bone collagen in fossil jaws and body size through measurement of fossil teeth; the abundance of material allows us to examine population level responses at millennial scale for the past 16 ka. Sigmodon was not present at the cave during the full glacial, first appearing at ~16 ka after ice sheets were in retreat. It remained relatively rare until ~12 ka when warming temperatures allowed it to expand its species range northward. We find variation in both diet and body size of sigmodon hispidus over time: the average body size of the population varied by ~20% (90â110 g) and mean î13c and î15n values ranged between â13.5 to â16.5â° and 5.5 to 7.4â° respectively. A stateâspace model suggested changes in mass were influenced by diet, maximum temperature and community structure, while the modest changes in diet were most influenced by community structure. Sigmodon maintained a fairly similar dietary niche over time despite contemporaneous changes in climate and herbivore community composition that followed the megafauna extinction. Broadly, our results suggest that small mammals may be as sensitive to shifts in local biotic interactions within their ecosystem as they are to changes in climate and large-scale biodiversity loss.

In recent decades, over-exploitation and landscape pressures have threatened them and led to a severe aquatic biodiversity crisis. In response, large-scale fishing bans have been promulgated to protect freshwater biodiversity in major chinese rivers since the early 1980s. Here, we present the historical background and current challenges to the fishing bans. Implementing large-scale fishing bans may help improve chinaâs current freshwater biological resources and biodiversity to some extent. But implementing fishing bans alone is not sufficient to solve the crisis because of shortcomings of the current bans and expanding human pressures in most river basins. Thus, we recommend regulating other anthropogenic pressures, expanding duration and extent of current fishing regulations, establishing a comprehensive monitoring program, and initiating basin-scale ecological rehabilitation. These programs are also needed in other developing countries facing similar biodiversity crises and human pressures.

540,2020,"Brain size and life history interact to predict urban tolerance in birds","Frontiers In Ecology And Evolution","Urbanization is a major driver of local biodiversity losses, but the traits that determine whether species are able to tolerate urban environments remain poorly understood. Theory suggests that a larger brain should provide higher tolerance to urbanization by enhancing behavioral flexibility to cope with novel challenges. However, assembling empirical evidence for a link between brain size and tolerance to urbanization has proven to be difficult, perhaps because the effect of the brain interacts with life history to influence persistence in urban environments. Here, we provide a global-scale assessment of the role of brain size on urban tolerance, combining quantitative estimations of urban tolerance with detailed information on brain size, life history and ecology for 629 avian species across 27 cities. Our analysis confirms the expected positive association between brain size and urban tolerance, but shows that the relationship is more complex than previously shown. While a large relative brain size generally increases urban tolerance, species with small brains can still attain high success in urban environments if they spread the risk of reproduction across multiple events (i.e., have a low brood value). These alternative strategies, although uncommon in natural conditions, seem to be favored in urban environments, fundamentally restructuring the composition of urban communities. Thus, our results support the notion that brain size mediates tolerance to urbanization, but also shows that there are alternative ways of exploiting urban environments. Our findings reconcile previous conflicting results regarding the effect of brain size on urban tolerance, and provide the basis for improved predictions of the responses of organisms to increasing urbanization over the coming decades.

Long-term directional shifts in bird communities were evident in intensive- and diversified-agricultural habitats, but were strongest in intensive-agricultural habitats, where the number of endemic and international union for conservation of nature (iucn) red list species fell over time. All major guilds, including those involved in pest control, pollination and seed dispersal, were affected. Bird communities in intensive-agricultural habitats proved more susceptible to changes in climate, with hotter and drier periods associated with greater changes in community composition in these settings. These findings demonstrate that diversified agriculture can help to alleviate the long-term loss of biodiversity outside natural protected areas1.

542,2020,"Local species diversity, î-diversity and climate influence the regional stability of bird biomass across north america","Proceedings Of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","Biodiversity often stabilizes aggregate ecosystem properties (e.g. Biomass) at small spatial scales. However, the importance of species diversity within communities and variation in species composition among communities (î-diversity) for stability at larger scales remains unclear. Using a continental-scale analysis of 1657 north american breeding-bird communities spanning 20-years and 35 ecoregions, we show local species diversity and î-diversity influence two components of regional stability: local stability (stability of bird biomass within sites) and spatial asynchrony (asynchronous fluctuations in biomass among sites). We found spatial asynchrony explained three times more variation in regional stability of bird biomass than did local stability. This result contrasts with studies at smaller spatial scalesâtypically plant metacommunities under 1 haâthat find local stability to be more important than spatial asynchrony. Moreover, spatial asynchrony of bird biomass increased with bird î-diversity and climate heterogeneity (temperature and precipitation), while local stability increased with species diversity. Our study reveals new insights into the scale-dependent processes regulating ecosystem stability, providing evidence that both local biodiversity loss and homogenization can destabilize ecosystem processes at biogeographic scales.

543,2020,"Monitoring vertebrate abundance in austria: developments over 30 years [die entwicklung von wirbeltierpopulationen in ãsterreich in den letzten 30 jahren]","Bodenkultur","Loss of biodiversity is one of the major challenges of the anthropocene. Various indices are used to quantify biodiversity. For vertebrates, the world wide fund for nature (wwf) uses the living planet index (lpi). It is calculated globally as well as separately for the species occurring in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine biomes. Action to prevent biodiversity loss can be taken by countries or provinces, so it is important to understand the changes in biodiversity at local scales. We present lpis for vertebrates in austria, both unweighted and weighted, according to species richness. Vertebrate populations seem to have declined strongly in austria, and their abundance was stabilized at about 60% of the initial population size in the base year 1990-the lpi declined from 1 in 1990 to ~0.6 (unweighted) or ~0.7 (weighted) in 2015. This is almost double the global decline for the same period. Lpis were calculated separately for the terrestrial biome (~0.6), the freshwater biome (~0.9), birds (~0.7), and native species (~0.6). These indices give evidence that conservation measure to halt biodiversity loss in austria is necessary and show where more data are needed. In austria, more research is needed especially on populations of reptile species.

544,2020,"Telecoupling of the trade of donkey-hides between botswana and china: challenges and opportunities","Sustainability (Switzerland)","International trade has become a major threat to biodiversity in the telecoupled world. The literature on biodiversity loss mostly concentrates on wild species; however, the increasing loss of and demand for domesticated species are overlooked. Donkeys are decreasing in many countries because of economic development, urbanization, and increased demand for donkey hides in china. The donkey population in africa has rapidly declined recently due to supplying china with donkey hides for the production of highly demanded and legalized traditional medicine, ejiao. As a result, some african countries, including botswana, banned the export of donkey hides. Animal protection and media continuously reported threats over the extinction of donkeys and exacerbated rural livelihood in developing countries, however, limited literature has investigated the causes and effects of donkey-hide trade and its policy interventions. This paper applies the telecoupling framework and uses the data extracted from the media reports and fao, to understand the scale and impacts of donkey-hide trade from botswana to china. We also explore the challenges and opportunities of donkey-hide trade for botswana, highlighting the mechanisms need to be established to regulate the donkey-hide trade, and also to harness available opportunities if the trade ban is lifted in the future.

Using the most recent human footprint dataset, we find that 70% of sundaland has been heavily modified by humans. This represents a 55% increase in areas under intense human pressure since 1993. Areas under intense human pressure covered on average 50% of the extent of key biodiversity areas, 78% of each protected area and 38% of the range of lowland forest specialist birds. The results imply that the actual level of protection by protected areas is only one-third to half of that on paper once human footprint is accounted for. While all protected areas were impacted by human pressures, those managed strictly for biodiversity conservation presented the largest increases. These results highlight an exceptionally high human footprint across sundaland and an impending further deepening of the biodiversity crisis across the region. Â© 2020 the authors.

In situ methods for species diversity assessment and biomass in synergy with hyperspectral data can adeptly serve this purpose and hence adopted in this study. Quadrat sampling was carried out in shoolpaneshwar wildlife sanctuary (sws), gujarat, which was used to compute shannonâweiner diversity index (hâ²). Above ground biomass (agb) was calculated measuring the height and diameter at breast height (dbh) of different trees in the sampling plots. Four spectral indices, namely normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi), enhanced vegetation index (evi), photochemical reflectance index (pri), and structure insensitive pigment index (sipi) were derived from the eo-1 hyperion data. Spearman and pearsonâs correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between hâ², agb and spectral indices. The best fit model was developed by establishing a relationship between hâ² and agb. Fifteen models were developed by performing multiple linear regression analysis using all possible combinations of spectral indices and hâ² and their validation was performed by relating observed hâ² with model predicted hâ². Pearsonâs correlation relation showed that sipi has the best relationship with the hâ². Model 15 with a combination of ndvi, pri and sipi was determined as the best model for retrieving hâ² based on its statistics performance and hence was used for generating species diversity map of the study area. Power model showed the best relationship between agb and hâ², which was used for the development of agb map.

547,2020,"Fishers' solutions for hammerhead shark conservation in peru","Biological Conservation","Filling ecological and social data gaps for small-scale fisheries is crucial for global conservation of shark species. In 2016, international protection of vulnerable smooth hammerhead sharks (sphyrna zygaena) resulted in a seasonal fishing ban to protect juvenile sharks in peru's small-scale fisheries. Richer data on the fisheries' social-ecological dynamics are necessary to understand fishery impacts and the ban's efficacy. Semi-structured interviews with 88 peruvian gillnetters revealed that fishers are cognizant of their impacts on the hammerhead population and further, that historical fishery impacts on the species are more severe than reflected in official records. On balance, respondents welcome conservation measures: 76% of respondents were in favor of the ban. However, most respondents also voiced objections to the ban, with unfairness emerging as a central theme including with regards to impracticality, economic severity, ecological necessity, and the burden of compliance. These objections may directly and indirectly stem from a lack of transparency and fisher participation in the ban development-and-implementation process. Fishers suggested alternative or additional options for hammerhead management, such as minimum sizes or dynamic âmove-onâ spatial closures. These results point to the benefits of a participatory process that engages fishers in practical and more equitable conservation solutions.

548,2020,"Parallel causation in oncogenic and anthropogenic degradation and extinction","Biological Theory","We propose that the onset and progressive destructive action of cancer within an individual bears a profound and striking similarity to the onset and progressive human-engendered destruction of global ecosystems and the extinction of entire species. Cancer in the human body and our human role in planetary, especially biotic, degradation are uncannily similar systems. For starters, they are the only two known complex systems where a discrete component changes its normal ecological role and functionâturning on and potentially killing its host, and in so doing, itself. Both are âhostile takeovers.â clearly, humans are integral to both systems. With cancer we are the host and victims of the rogue behavior of what starts out as a normal, healthy, and functionally important part of our bodies. With the biodiversity crisis, we are the part of the system that has changed, expanded, and proven so destructive to the system in which we live. We argue that given that these threats to our bodies and earth are both essentially ecological diseases, understanding the critical role of ecological interdependencies for avoiding both cancerâs and humankindâs destruction of their respective homes should hopefully promote better stewardship of both by the only animal capable of recognizing the problemsâus.

549,2020,"The effects of forestry and agroforestry plantations on bird diversity: a global synthesis","Land Degradation And Development","The increasing expansion of productive lands around the world during the last decades constitutes a strong driver of biodiversity loss, as they are usually established near to high diversity areas. Despite many studies that have compared bird diversity between natural and productive systems, a global synthesis is still missing and important for understanding how biodiversity is being altered. We conducted a meta-analysis based on 144 case studies to assess the effects of four types of plantations (forestry, oil palm, coffee, and cacao) on bird species richness and abundance. We examined those effects in function of plantation type, latitudinal zone (temperate or tropical), geographical context (mainland or island), zoogeographic zone, and biodiversity hotspots. Plantations presented negative effects on both bird species richness and abundance. Oil palm plantations showed more negative effects followed by forestry plantations, whereas coffee and cacao agroforestry plantations had no significant effects. Those effects were geographically variable, being more pronounced in islands and temperate zones, as well as at the oriental, palearctic, and neotropical zoogeograghic regions, and at the sundaland and mediterranean basin biodiversity hotspots. Our results showed that productive systems reduce both species richness and abundance of bird species, being insular species particularly susceptible. Exotic monocultures with low structural heterogeneity (e.g., oil palm plantations) derive in highly impoverished bird communities dominated by generalist species. We identified south east asia, tropical south america, and the mediterranean basin as the most threatened regions because of the sensitivity of their bird communities and the increasing rates of native forest replacement.

550,2020,"A little-known endemic caught in the south-east asian extinction crisis: the annamite striped rabbit nesolagus timminsi","Oryx","The annamite mountains of viet nam and the lao people's democratic republic (lao) are an area of exceptional mammalian endemism but intensive poaching has defaunated much of the region, creating an extinction crisis for the endemic species. To make efficient use of limited conservation resources, it is imperative that conservation stakeholders obtain basic information about poorly known and threatened endemics. We present the first comprehensive information on the ecology, distribution and status of the little-known endemic annamite striped rabbit nesolagus timminsi. We used a systematic camera-trapping design to study the species in five areas in viet nam and lao. In 29,180 camera-trap-nights we recorded 152 independent events at 36 of 266 stations. We obtained an additional 143 independent detections across 12 stations from a supplementary non-systematic survey. We analysed activity patterns and social behaviour. We also used single-species occupancy models to assess factors that influence occupancy at the landscape scale. We used n-mixture models to obtain local abundance estimates in one target area. The annamite striped rabbit was found to be nocturnal and primarily solitary. Species occupancy was best explained by a proxy for past hunting pressure, with no significant relationships to current anthropogenic or environmental factors. Local abundance was 0.57 individuals per camera-trap station for one of our sites, and estimated to be zero at the other site where hunting appears to have been more intense. Our results provide information on priority areas for targeted anti-poaching efforts and give the first conservation baseline for the species.

551,2020,"No net loss of species diversity after prescribed fires in the brazilian savanna","Frontiers In Forests And Global Change","Although savannas are fire-adapted ecosystems, prescribing fire for biodiversity conservation remains controversial at least in some regions where savannas occur. Faced with uncertainty, many decision makers and even scientists are still reluctant to prescribe fire for conservation purposes in fire-prone ecosystems, invoking the precautionary principle. Knowledge gaps on the ideal fire regime, such as how and when to burn, and especially the fear of biodiversity losses, are among the main arguments against fire management applied to remnants of native savanna vegetation. To inform this debate, we assessed the impact of prescribed fires on diversity of plants (different growth forms), ants, frogs, lizards, birds, and small mammals, in savannas and grasslands of the brazilian cerrado. We assessed the existing species richness, composition, and abundance in areas subjected to long periods of fire suppression and compared to that observed over a short period after prescribed dry-season fires, within each group of plants and animals. Whenever possible, we carried out separate analyses for grassland and savanna. Burning did not significantly reduce species richness of any of the groups analyzed, but had a positive effect on richness of graminoids in grassland. When analyzed at the species level, abundance of most animal groups did not show consistent responses to fire, except for a decrease in some frog populations in grasslands. Forbs, graminoids, and subshrubs increased in abundance after fire in grassland areas, though in savanna areas, abundance of forbs, and subshrubs tended to decline after fire. Species composition changed little in response to fire as indicated by low levels of dissimilarity between burned and unburned areas. These results confirm the high resilience of cerrado biota to fire, as expected for savanna ecosystems in general. Besides, we demonstrate here that the risk of biodiversity losses cannot justify the objections to the use of prescribed fire for conservation purposes in the cerrado.

552,2020,"Patch size and vegetation structure drive changes to mixed-species flock diversity and composition across a gradient of fragment sizes in the western andes of colombia","Condor","Forest fragmentation is a leading driver of biodiversity loss, yet its effects on positive species interactions remain poorly known. We examined the effects of fragmentation on mixed-species bird flocks in the western andes of colombia. Using 500-m transect surveys (n = 14 transects), we sampled flocks in 8 fragments (range: 10-173 ha) and an unfragmented reference site within the same altitudinal band (1,900-2,200 m.a.s.l.) And matrix type (cattle pasture). We evaluated the relative contributions of 9 predictor variables, including patch size, distance from edge, and selective aspects of vegetation structure on the composition, size, species richness, functional diversity, and phylogenetic diversity of flocks. We found effects of both patch size and vegetation structure on flock species richness, size, and functional diversity, but no support for edge effects. Generally, flock richness and size responded differently to fragmentation than did functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics. Both flock size and richness increased with patch size, but this variable had no effect on functional and phylogenetic diversity. Flock richness and size increased in high-canopy forests with greater foliage height diversity, whereas unlogged, old-growth primary forests with large-diameter trees had lower flock richness and size, but significantly greater functional diversity. Phylogenetic diversity was not affected by patch size, edge effects, or vegetation structure. We found differences in flock composition in response to fragmentation. Richness of furnariidae in flocks increased with increasing distance from edge and foliage height diversity, whereas that of thraupidae and boreal migrant species increased in early successional and forest edge flocks, respectively. All flock diversity metrics differed significantly seasonally, with smaller, less diverse flocks observed in january-march than in june-august. Flocking behavior persisted in 10-ha fragments, likely because andean flocks are ""open membership""in nature, but there was extensive species turnover as forest edge and generalist species replaced forest-interior species in smaller fragments.

553,2020,"Remembrance day for lost species: toward an ethics of witnessing extinction","Performance Research","This essay explores the work remembrance day for lost species (rdls), a coalition of artists, activists, and environmental organizations who memorialise the losses of extinction. I argue that rdls's practices create an ethics of witnessing ecological loss in ways that expand discourses about what (and who) counts as grievable life. I take up judith butler's theorisation of the powers of mourning in rendering life legible to illuminate the ways rdls mobilises grief and absence, thus reimagining relations between humans and nonhumans in a space outside of capital. Rdls participants unite on 30 november to bear witness to the extinction of species, habitats and cultures. The movement was founded in 2011 by uk-based performance collective feral theatre, artist andreas kornevall and reverend peter owen jones. Several other organizations and artists have since joined, though anyone may create participate, adding their events to the rdls crowd-sourced electronic archive. I look at a particular event, the lake merritt regenerative memorial and pollinator procession (2017), to articulate the performance practices brought together under rdls as a praxis of ethical witnessing in the time of climate crises. Rdls renders nonhumans as subjects through the creation of mourning rituals for extinct and endangered species. By approaching nonhumans through what butler has called grievability, rdls counters the human exceptionalism that supports the exploitation of nature as merely raw material for endless accumulation. By challenging this logic of accumulation, rdls participates in a queering of normative capitalist time through the creation of a time-space outside of the inexorable forward movement of capital. As they engage in ânonproductiveâ uses of time, rdls resists the vast unmarked (biodiversity) loss intrinsic to global capitalism, bringing forth new forms of human and nonhuman relationality in the face of ecological breakdown.

We document the collapse of a neotropical snake community after the invasive fungal pathogen batrachochytrium dendrobatidis caused a chytridiomycosis epizootic leading to the catastrophic loss of amphibians, a food source for snakes. After mass mortality of amphibians, the snake community contained fewer species and was more homogeneous across the study site, with several species in poorer body condition, despite no other systematic changes in the environment. The demise of the snake community after amphibian loss demonstrates the repercussive and often unnoticed consequences of the biodiversity crisis and calls attention to the invisible declines of rare and data-deficient species.

555,2020,"An analysis of threats and factors that predict trends in canadian vertebrates designated as at-risk","Facets","The identification of factors that predict trends in population abundance is critical to formulate successful conservation strategies. Here, we explore population trends of canadian vertebrates assessed as ""at-risk"" by the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada and the threats affecting these trends using data from the canadian living planet index. We investigate how threat profiles-the combination of threats for a given species-vary among species and taxonomic groups. We then investigate threat profile as a predictor of temporal trends-both exclusively and in combination with additional biotic and abiotic factors. Species had 5.06 (â±2.77) threats listed on average, and biological resource use (bru) was the most frequently cited. Our analysis also revealed an association between taxonomic group and population trends, as measured by the proportion of annual increases (years with a positive interannual change). By contrast, the predictive power of threat profile was poor. This analysis yielded some useful insight for conservation action, particularly the prioritization of abating bru. However, the predictive models were not as meaningful as originally anticipated. We provide recommendations on methodological improvements to advance the understanding of factors that predict trends in population abundance for prioritizing conservation action. Â© 2020 facets.

556,2020,"Climate change challenges iucn conservation priorities: a test with western mediterranean amphibians","Sn Applied Sciences","One common approach to assigning conservation priorities during the current biodiversity crisis is to identify and direct efforts to high profile, vulnerable taxa, and important biodiversity areas. We addressed the first issue by assessing the comparison between conservation status and habitat suitability under differing climate change scenarios for sixteen species of five amphibian families (pelobatidae, bufonidae, alytidae, hylidae and ranidae) distributed on both sides of the gibraltar strait, with the aim of verify whether potentially sensible species under climatic change scenarios are or not considered at risk presently in the iucn current categories. We have addressed this with an environmental niche modelling algorithm (maxent) and projecting the outputs in four future climatic change scenarios. Our results demonstrate that climatic niches of some species may currently match their conservation category, with pelobates varaldii having the narrowest distribution and being the more endangered species, but not all responses to predicted climatic change scenarios are related to conservation status. Some suggest notable changes in potential climatic habitats, with both substantial increase (7 species) and decrease (5 species) represented. Threatened species such as p. Varaldii could be climatically favored whereas currently more abundant species could maintain, increase, or reduce their habitat distribution. These results have implications for current conservation strategies, and suggest that this approach deserves consideration as part of any species or habitat conservation strategy in the future.

With an effort of 4,797 km in 725 km2 of western gir protected area, india, we used polygon search based spatially explicit capture recapture framework to estimate lion density. Using vibrissae patterns and permanent body marks we identified 67 lions from 368 lion sightings. We conducted distance sampling on 35 transects with an effort of 101.5 km to estimate spatial prey density using generalized additive modeling (gam). Subsequently, we modeled lion spatial density with prey, habitat characteristics, anthropogenic factors and distance to baiting sites. Lion density (>1-year-old lions) was estimated at 8.53 (se 1.05) /100 km2 with lionesses having smaller movement parameter (î£ = 2.55 km; se 0.12) compared to males (î£ = 5.32 km; se 0.33). Detection corrected sex ratio (female:male lions) was 1.14 (se 0.02). Chital (axis axis) was the most abundant ungulate with a density of 63.29 (se 10.14) as determined by conventional distance sampling (cds) and 58.17 (se 22.17)/km2 with density surface modeling (dsm), followed by sambar (rusa unicolor) at 3.84 (se 1.07) and 4.73 (se 1.48)/km2 estimated by cds and dsm respectively. Spatial lion density was best explained by proximity to baiting sites and flat valley habitat but not as much by prey density. We demonstrate a scientifically robust approach to estimate lion abundance, that due to its spatial context, can be useful for management of habitat and human-lion interface. We recommend this method for lion population assessment across their range. High lion densities in western gir were correlated with baiting. The management practice of attracting lions for tourism can perturb natural lion densities, disrupt behavior, lion social dynamics and have detrimental effects on local prey densities.

558,2020,"Potential habitat suitability of iraqi amphibians under climate change","Biodiversitas","Biodiversity management and conservation planning are two techniques for reducing the rate of biodiversity loss, especially under the effect of climate change. Here 289 records of five species of amphibians from iraq and seven environmental variables were used with maxent to predict potential habitat suitability for each species under current and future conditions, using the 5th ipcc assessment (rcp 2.6 and rcp 8.5 for the year 2050). The models suggest that annual precipitation and the mean temperature of the wettest quarter are the main factors that shape the distributions of these species. The estimated current habitat suitability was closely similar to that for 2050 under both scenarios, with a high niche overlap between them for all species. Among species, there were low niche overlaps between the frogs bufo viridis, hyla savignyi and rana ridibunda, and also between the salamanders neurergus crocatus and neurergus microspilotus. Future sampling should focus on areas not currently covered by records to reduce bias. The results are a vital first step in long-term conservation planning for these species. Via sharing these results with decision-makers and stakeholders a crucial conservation actions need to increase iraqi protected areas to avoid losing biodiversity in iraq especially the unique populations and threaten species.

The following parameters were monitored annually: (i) total fish density; (ii) fish trophic group densities; (iii) species richness and three fish diversity indices; (iv) relative scleractinian coral cover; and (v) relative macroalgae cover. In the years in which coastal development, such as the construction of a marina, took place, an increase in the abundance of territorial herbivorous and planktivorous fish was observed. As the coral recovered, macrocarnivores and sessile benthic invertivores were re-established, whereas scraper herbivores showed no changes in the period of study in any of the three management zones. Coral cover recovery showed rapid phase-shift reversal (phase-shift, macroalgae dominance over coral) in the three zones. Even though the fish density and coral cover recovered, the diversity indices of each fish trophic group exhibited a reduction in the three management zones over time.

560,2020,"Distinguishing extinction and natural selection in the anthropocene: preventing the panda paradox through practical education measures: we must rethink evolution teaching to prevent misuse of natural selection to biologically justify today's human caused mass extinction crisis","Bioessays","In the midst of only the 6th mass extinction in the earth's history, we must rethink how we teach evolution to prevent natural selection from being incorrectly used as a biological justification for inaction in the face of today's human-caused mass extinction crisis. Pundits, policy makers, and the general public regularly identify the extinction of endangered species as natural selection at work, rather than attributing modern-day extinction to the sudden catastrophic bad luck of human caused environmental change, a phenomenon distinct from natural selection. In this natural selection framing, the inability of species to survive in human altered environments is the normal progression of âsurvival of the fittestâ and conservation measures designed to protect species is human interference with natural selection. Paradoxically, this erroneous framing of extinction as the normal course of natural selection ignores humanity's exceptional role in causing today's mass extinction crisis. Our examination of this issue in u.s. College students indicates that it arises from misunderstanding the role of extinction in the history of life, leading us to recommend a greater teaching emphasis on the distinction between extinction and natural selection, and on past mass extinction events.

561,2020,"Macroalgae removal on coral reefs: realised ecosystem functions transcend biogeographic locations","Coral Reefs","Coral reef ecosystems are at the forefront of biodiversity loss and climate change-mediated transformations. This is expected to have profound consequences for the functioning of these ecosystems. However, assessments of ecosystem function on reefs are often spatially limited, within biogeographic realms, or rely on presumed proxies such as traits. To address these shortcomings and assess the effects of biogeography and fish presence on the critical ecosystem function of macroalgal removal, we used assays of six algal genera across three reef habitats in two biogeographically distinct locations: little cayman in the caribbean and lizard island on the great barrier reef (gbr). Patterns of fish feeding and realised ecosystem function were strikingly similar between the two geographic locations, despite a threefold difference in the local diversity of nominally herbivorous fishes, a 2.4-fold difference in the diversity of fishes feeding and differences in the biogeographic history of the two locations. In both regions, a single species dominated the function: a surgeonfish, naso unicornis, at the gbr location and, surprisingly, a triggerfish, melichthys niger, at the caribbean location. Both species, especially m. Niger, were relatively rare, compared to other nominally herbivorous fishes, in censuses covering more than 14,000â m2 at each location. Our study provides novel insights into the critical function of macroalgal removal in hyperdiverse coral reef ecosystems, highlighting: (a) that function can transcend biogeographic, taxonomic and historical constraints; and (b) shortcomings in our assumptions regarding fish presence and realised ecosystem function on coral reefs.

562,2020,"Fragmented tropical forests lose mutualistic plantâanimal interactions","Diversity And Distributions","Aim: forest fragmentation is among the principal causes of global biodiversity loss, yet how it affects mutualistic interactions between plants and animals at large spatial scale is poorly understood. In particular, tropical forest regeneration depends on animal-mediated seed dispersal, but the seed-dispersing animals face rapid decline due to forest fragmentation and defaunation. Here, we assess how fragmentation influences the pairwise interactions between 407 seed disperser and 1,424 tree species in a highly fragmented biodiversity hotspot. Location: atlantic forest, south america. Methods: we predicted interaction networks in 912 sites covering the entire biome by combining verified interaction data with co-occurrence probabilities obtained from a spatially explicit joint species distribution model. We identified keystone seed dispersers by computing a species-specific keystone index and by selecting those species belonging to the top 5% quantile. Results: we show that forest fragmentation affects seed dispersal interactions negatively, and the decreased area of functionally connected forest, rather than increased edge effects, is the main driver behind the loss of interactions. Both the seed disperser availability for the local tree communities and in particular the proportion of interactions provided by keystone seed dispersers decline with increasing degree of fragmentation. Importantly, just 21 keystone species provided >40% of all interactions. The numbers of interactions provided by keystone and non-keystone species, however, were equally negatively affected by fragmentation, suggesting that seed dispersal interactions may not be rewired under strong fragmentation effects. Conclusions: we highlight the importance of understanding the fragmentation-induced compositional shifts in seed disperser communities as they may lead to lagged and multiplicative effects on tree communities. Our results illustrate the utility of model-based prediction of interaction networks as well as model-based identification of keystone species as a tool for prioritizing conservation efforts. Similar modelling approaches could be applied to other threatened ecosystems and interaction types globally. Â© 2019 the authors.

563,2020,"Urban effluents affect the early development stages of brazilian fish species with implications for their population dynamics","Ecotoxicology And Environmental Safety","The pollution from urban effluents discharged into natural waters is a major cause of aquatic biodiversity loss. Ecotoxicological testing contributes significantly to understand the risk of exposure to the biota and to establish conservation policies. The objective of the current study was to assess the toxicity of a river highly influenced by urban effluents (atuba river, curitiba city, southern brazil) to the early stages of development in four south american native fish species, investigating the consequences at the population level through mathematical modelling. The species chosen were salminus brasiliensis, prochilodus lineatus, rhamdia quelen, and pseudoplatystoma corruscans, ecologically important species encompassing different conservation statuses and vulnerability. The embryos were exposed from 8 to 96 h post fertilization to the atuba river water, collected downstream of the largest wastewater treatment plant in the metropolitan region of curitiba, and their survival rates and deformities were registered. The species s. Brasiliensis and p. Lineatus presented the highest mortality rates, showing high sensitivity to the pollutants present in the water. According to the individual-based mathematical model, these species showed high vulnerability and risk of extinction under the tested experimental conditions, even when different sensitivity scenarios of juveniles and adults were considered. The other two species, r. Quelen and p. Corruscans, showed a more resistant condition to mortality, but also presented high frequency and severity of deformities. These results emphasize the importance of testing the sensitivity of different brazilian native species for the conservation of biodiversity and the application of models to predict the effects of pollutants at the population level.

564,2020,"What evidence exists on the impact of agricultural practices in fruit orchards on biodiversity? A systematic map","Environmental Evidence","Background: biodiversity loss, partly due to intensification of agriculture, has become a global issue. In this context, fruit producers have been looking for nature-friendly production methods. By reducing intensive pesticide use and enhancing orchard management, they aim to create habitats suitable for beneficial organisms. Fruit production, especially in low-stem orchards, requires several interventions (plant protection, tillage, greenwork) throughout the year, each of them representing a disturbance. Thus, an expert system that evaluates and aggregates the impact of individual farming activities on a set of biodiversity indicators would be a valuable tool for developing new, less biodiversity-damaging scenarios. This expert system should be based on expert knowledge and scientific evidence. Surprisingly, our literature searches suggested that international journals contain few publications on the impact of most practices (except pesticide use) in orchards on biodiversity in general and beneficial organisms in particular. However, in the last decade, an increasing number of published articles have pointed out the rising importance of biodiversity in life cycle assessment. We therefore compiled and structured the available evidence to (1) assess the state of research on discrete biodiversity indicators and agricultural practices, (2) identify the literature relevant for assessing production impact and habitat suitability for supporting biodiversity and (3) provide a wide-ranging overview of existing evidence of the impact of agricultural practices in fruit orchards on biodiversity. Methods: a systematic literature search was performed in scientific journals, agronomy magazines and across the internet in english, german and french. The main reviewer followed a step-by-step eligibility scheme that was validated by a kappa test between two reviewers. Additionally, a third reviewer checked a subset of articles. We mapped a large range of parameters, which were structured in code sets. To compute a study validity assessment, we used 13 parameters that reflected the relevance of each article to the impact of agricultural practices in fruit orchards on biodiversity indicator species groups. Results: the search returned 947 included articles. The map identified major differences in the attention given to different indicators and practices over time, ranging from closely investigated (clusters) to neglected (gaps) - e.g. Spiders and birds or amphibians and reptiles, respectively. The majority of studies were short-term surveys, mainly done in low-stem orchards. Main areas studied were western europe and eastern north america. The resulting database is presented along with descriptive statistics of the distribution and abundance of evidence across time, interventions and outcomes. Conclusions: the current systematic map reveals that rigorous and comprehensive investigations on the suitability of orchards as perennial habitats for wildlife, run on the long-term and following a holistic approach, are still basically lacking. Although evidence base on orchard management effects on particular organisms has grown over the past two decades, information to develop reliable close-to-nature management tools and strategies is insufficient. The implications for policy and research suggest that - in view of worldwide biodiversity loss, which may cause a major threat for food production - a better understanding of the role played by orchards and their management in agricultural landscapes for biodiversity is required.

565,2020,"Land-use history impacts functional diversity across multiple trophic groups","Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America","Land-use change is a major driver of biodiversity loss worldwide. Although biodiversity often shows a delayed response to land-use change, previous studies have typically focused on a narrow range of current landscape factors and have largely ignored the role of land-use history in shaping plant and animal communities and their functional characteristics. Here, we used a unique database of 220,000 land-use records to investigate how 20-y of land-use changes have affected functional diversity across multiple trophic groups (primary producers, mutualists, herbivores, invertebrate predators, and vertebrate predators) in 75 grassland fields with a broad range of land-use histories. The effects of land-use history on multitrophic trait diversity were as strong as other drivers known to impact biodiversity, e.g., grassland management and current landscape composition. The diversity of animal mobility and resourceacquisition traits was lower in landscapes where much of the land had been historically converted from grassland to crop. In contrast, functional biodiversity was higher in landscapes containing old permanent grasslands, most likely because they offer a stable and high-quality habitat refuge for species with low mobility and specialized feeding niches. Our study shows that grassland-to-crop conversion has long-lasting impacts on the functional biodiversity of agricultural ecosystems. Accordingly, land-use legacy effects must be considered in conservation programs aiming to protect agricultural biodiversity. In particular, the retention of permanent grassland sanctuaries within intensive landscapes may offset ecological debts. Â© 2020 national academy of sciences.

566,2020,"Recovery of critically endangered nassau grouper (epinephelus striatus) in the cayman islands following targeted conservation actions","Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America","Many large-bodied marine fishes that form spawning aggregations, such as the nassau grouper (epinephelus striatus), have suffered regional overfishing due to exploitation during spawning. In response, marine resource managers in many locations have established marine protected areas or seasonal closures to recover these overfished stocks. The challenge in assessing management effectiveness lies largely in the development of accurate estimates to track stock size through time. For the past 15 y, the cayman islands government has taken a series of management actions aimed at recovering collapsed stocks of nassau grouper. Importantly, the government also partnered with academic and nonprofit organizations to establish a research and monitoring program (grouper moon) aimed at documenting the impacts of conservation action. Here, we develop an integrated population model of 2 cayman nassau grouper stocks based on both diver-collected mark-resight observations and video censuses. Using both data types across multiple years, we fit parameters for a state-space model for population growth. We show that over the last 15 y the nassau grouper population on little cayman has more than tripled in response to conservation efforts. Census data from cayman brac, while more sparse, show a similar pattern. These findings demonstrate that spatial and seasonal closures aimed at rebuilding aggregationbased fisheries can foster conservation success. Â© 2020 national academy of sciences.

567,2020,"The interactive effects of climate change and land use on boreal stream fish communities","Science Of The Total Environment","Ongoing and projected climate change is likely to greatly alter co-occurring stressor mechanisms, yet these potential interactions remain poorly understood in natural freshwater systems worldwide. As the global biodiversity crisis deepens, successful conservation efforts will hinge on developing mechanistic multiple stressor frameworks that have been ground-truthed in natural systems containing complex species dynamics and ecological processes. Our study examined the combined and interacting effects of potential climate and land use stressors on boreal stream fishes using data from over 300 catchments across a broad 250,000 km2 region. To characterize boreal fish community health, we examined four indicators including species richness, total catch per unit effort, the proportion of lithophilic spawners (fish sensitive to sedimentation), and the assemblage tolerance index which provides a measurement of the overall community tolerance to disturbance. Land use stressors included total anthropogenic land use area and linear disturbance at multiple watershed scales as well as two site-specific habitat degradation indicators (dissolved oxygen and the proportion of fine substrate). Overall community richness and productivity were not negatively related to land use changes indicating potential compensatory dynamics (e.g. Where intolerant species are replaced with more tolerant species as habitat quality degrades). In contrast, we observed declines for sensitive species, including highly valued salmonids, that varied depending on interactions between local climate, land use, and stream type. Sensitive species declines were concentrated in regions experiencing increased land use and warming, whereas increases were observed in cooler regions consistent with a subsidy-stress response. In addition, lithophilic spawners declined in watersheds experiencing warmer and wetter conditions owing to potential indirect effects on spawning habitat quality. Results from our study provide novel insight into complex climate and land use interactions occurring across a broad, real-world landscape, and highlight the potential for amplified species declines under future warming and land use scenarios.

Social acceptability of management actions for mitigating these conflicts can influence the success of wild carnivore management. Our study was carried out in southern chile where we evaluated levels of social acceptability and consensus (using pci2) for frightening, relocating, and lethal control in different scenarios for conflicts with pumas and foxes (native species), and feral dogs. Frightening or relocating wild carnivores were more socially acceptable than to not carry out any actions. In comparison to non-ranchers, ranchers were more likely to accept lethal control for feral dogs. Finally, ranchers were more accepting of lethal control for feral dogs rather than lethal control for native carnivores. We found that social group (ranchers or non-ranchers), type of encounter scenario, and carnivore type influenced the social acceptability of different management actions.

The commitment and participation of local people in conservation activities, however, are crucial for conservation success. Here we assess attitudes and perceptions towards rhino poaching and conservation in light of surveys in two local communities adjacent to the hlane royal national park in eswatini where perhaps 100 black (diceros bicornis) and white (ceratotherium simum) rhino occur. Our survey of 60 households addressed perceptions and attitudes towards rhino conservation and willingness to participate in rhino poaching and conservation activities. No efforts have been made to involve local people in conservation activities, and the people do not benefit from the park's activities. About 20% of respondents expressed their willingness to help rhino poachers provided they are paid for their services. Of the remaining 80%, some mentioned that they would not help poachers for fear of being apprehended. Still, some mentioned that they would not help poachers because of their concern about poaching and believe its prevention is important. Park authorities here and elsewhere could invest in building better people-park relationships, and provide opportunities for local communities to participate in conservation activities. Conservation policies to co-manage the resources could be used to deter poaching and to conserve wildlife involving local community members in monitoring and enforcement strategies.

In this study we analyze the scientific literature on amphibian declines with a view to identifying and analyzing emerging patterns within this large, and growing, body of knowledge. Focussing on peer-reviewed papers published between 1977 and 2018, we identified a total of 2,619 scientific publications, from the scopus database. Using a visual-clustering approach, which allows us to investigate patterns and trends of research topics, we developed term-maps to identify how key terms cluster into research areas, and whether geographic patterns exist in the scientific literature on this subject. Overall, the average annual growth rate of the number of studies published on amphibian declines was 109.3%, with a decisive increase since 2001. The term map analysis revealed four main research areas: i) ecolo-gy; ii) causes and consequences of pollution; iii) global threats and extinction risk; and iv) pathogens (which includes many current publications, especially those focused on chytridiomycosis). We confirm the existence of a geographical research bias in the study of amphibian decline, with studies mainly located in western countries, which harbour a smaller number of threatened species. In contrast, studies on threatened species are consistently underrepresented. The literature on amphibian declines has increased at a greater rate than general amphibian literature, highlighting the pos-sibility that the observed amphibian decline has been a driver for amphibian research.

571,2020,"Efficacy of different traditional methods in mitigating human-elephant conflict in rani-garbhanga area of assam, india","Asian Journal Of Conservation Biology","Conservation of elephants has become a challenging issue due to ever-increasing human-elephant conflict throughout its distribution range. The economic loss incurred by the farmers along with the manslaughter creating negativity towards elephants that leads to retaliatory killing of elephants. So, the conservation success depends on the mitigation measures of human-elephant conflict. All the high-tech methods are highly cost-effective as well as not at all effective under different landscape. Hence, the use of traditional methods along with the high-tech methods is globally suggested for mitigation of human-elephant conflict. Therefore, a study was conducted in the fringe villages of rani-garbhanga reserved forests of assam, india to find out the traditional methods of conflict mitigation using both field survey (night stay) and questionnaire method during 2016-2019. The study found that the elephants were prevented by 12.2% from crop damage whereas for 46.5% the villagers were partially successful while another 41.3% completely failed to prevent elephant. The most commonly employed intervention methods were noise (100%) followed by beating drum (91%), use of fireball (65%), spotlight (24%), and firecracker (18%). However, when either was used in combination with noise their efficacy was compromised (interactions between noise and fire, noise and spotlight, noise and fences). Noise also works as an intervention technique, but only when used on its own. The study further suggested for use of modern technologies along with the traditional methods to take long-term measures to mitigate human-elephant conflict in this area.

In fact, taxonomies inferred from statistically significant diagnostic morphological characters in the absence of phylogenetic considerations, can contain non-monophyletic lineages. This is especially true at the species level where small amounts of gene flow may not preclude the evolution of localized adaptions in different geographic areas while underpinning the paraphyletic nature of each population with respect to the other. We illustrate this point by examining genetic and morphological variation among three putatively allopatric populations of the granite-dwelling bent-toed gecko cyrtodactylus aequalis from hilly regions in southeastern myanmar. In the absence of molecular phylogenetic inference, a compelling argument for three morphologically diagnosable species could be marshaled. However, when basing the morphological analyses of geographic variation on a molecular phylogeny, there is a more compelling argument that only one species should be recognized. We are cognizant of the fact however, that when dealing with rare species or specimens for which no molecular data are possible, judicious morphological analyses are the only option-and the desired option given the current worldwide biodiversity crisis.

576,2020,"Conservation implications of using an imitation carnivore to assess rarely used refuges as critical habitat features in an alpine ungulate","Peerj","Understanding relationships between animals and their habitat is a central goal in ecology with important implications for conservation. Misidentified habitat requirements can have serious repercussions because land protection or reintroductions might occur in less than optimal habitat. Studies of resource selection have greatly facilitated an understanding of ecological relationships but can be improved when vital yet infrequently utilized habitat features are more fully described. A critical element for many prey species is escape terrain or some other form of refuge to avoid predation. Mountain goats (oreamnos americanus) are well known for their use of cliffs to avoid predation, but a survey of the literature revealed at least twelve different approximations of goat escape terrain, ranging from > 25â¦ to > 50â¦ slopes. Here, we seek to (1) enhance estimates of mountain goat escape terrain and antipredator behavior, and (2) highlight the limitations of the assumption that the time an animal spends in an area is proportional to importance. To improve estimates of goat escape terrain, we conducted field work across two years (2014â15) in glacier national park, montana usa and manipulated apparent predation risk by exposing mountain goats to a threatening simulated grizzly bear (ursus arctos) treatment and a non-threatening ungulate (control) treatment. Mountain goats moved in response to the simulated bear but not in response to the simulated ungulate, with shorter latencies to move for subjects in larger groups and at shorter distances to the simulated threat. Through a used-unused resource selection function we tested 22 landscape variables to describe the use of escape terrain. Proximity to slopes greater than 60â¦ best explained the locations to which mountain goats fled after exposure to the simulated bear, and the average slope of these escape locations was 56.5â¦ (â±14.1 s.d.). Our results suggest that mountain goat escape terrain be considered at slopes of 60â¦ as a minimum because our simulated threat did not include pursuit of goats and, thus, slopes of 60â¦ are likely underestimates of actual escape terrain. Additionally, because direct interactions between carnivores and goats seldom occur, serious escape terrain is infrequently used. Past estimates of escape may have miscalculated the slopes which goats select for in response to predation risk. Based on experimental approaches in the wild, we suggest that anti-predator behavior should be included in studies of resource selection when the goal is to consider habitat as a predictor for conservation success. Finally, we discuss evidence suggesting a past mountain goat introduction failed due to lack of adequate escape terrain and subsequent recolonization of a predator.

577,2020,"Who's afraid of the big bad boar? Assessing the effect of wild boar presence on the occurrence and activity patterns of other mammals","Plos One","Wild boar are considered one the world's worst invasive species and linked to biodiversity loss, competition for resources, predation of native species, and habitat modifications. In this study, we use camera traps to evaluate whether the invasive wild boar had an effect on the medium-sized mammal community of a protected area in southern brazil. Based on photographic records, we evaluated whether the presence and relative abundance of wild boar was associated with a decrease in diversity or change in activity of medium-sized mammals. All comparisons were made between samples where wild boar were present or absent. The records of each camera during a season were considered a sample. The wild boar was the fourth most common species in the study area being present in 7.8% of the photographic records. The species richness of mammals was not negatively affected by the occurrence of wild boar and most common species did not exhibit changes in the daily activity pattern. However, we recorded an increase in the time elapsed between an observation of wild boar and the record of the next species relative to the average latency period observed among other mammalian species. This average latency period was similar to that observed in the case of large predators such as puma, and its increase could be reflective partly of the avoidance of native species to wild boar. Nevertheless, our results show that the effect of invasive wild boar on the mammal community is not large as expected.","10.1371/journal.pone.0235312","Scopus","Scopus_577",245,0.17493122750618,-0.074758145936891,"250","neutral","neutral_250",0
578,2020,"Effects of forest fragmentation on feather corticosterone levels in an amazonian avian community","Ardeola","Summary . In the amazon, the construction of hydroelectric dams is an emergent driver of biodiversity loss, creating numerous land-bridge islands, most of them unable to sustain an assemblage of bird species comparable to the intact forest. Although we understand the effects of forest fragmentation on species richness and distribution, we still need to uncover the physiological mechanisms underlying the success of organisms living in disturbed habitats. In this study, we used feather corticosterone levels as a measurement of physiological indicators of stress, evaluating whether corticosterone levels mirror the effects of habitat fragmentation on species occurrence. Since data suggest that smaller islands can reduce habitat suitability, increasing stress in birds that live within them, we predicted that birds living in smaller islands would present increased feather corticosterone levels. We captured birds in 13 islands of varying size and in two continuous forests and analysed feather corticosterone levels of 265 individuals from eight different species. Overall, our findings did not support the hypothesis that corticosterone varies in relation to island size, except for the guianan antwarbler hypocnemis cantator, which presented the predicted pattern: decreasing feather corticosterone levels with increasing island size. These differences suggest that species respond differently to stressors driven by fragmentation. Further studies are necessary to assess the reliability of corticosterone levels as a physiological measurement of stress and to determine which parameters are useful to understand how insularisation caused by human activities may influence the resistance of avian populations to habitat disturbances. - bicudo, t., anciães, m., arregui, l. & Gil, d.

579,2020,"Predictors of puma occupancy indicate prey vulnerability is more important than prey availability in a highly fragmented landscape","Wildlife Biology","Habitat fragmentation represents the single greatest conservation challenge of the 21st century. This problem is particularly acute for large, obligate carnivores like pumas puma concolor which have persisted in north and south america in the face of habitat fragmentation and other anthropogenic disturbances. Shrinking habitat and reduced connectivity mean that mapping habitat is increasingly important for species conservation in multiple-use landscapes. Previous work suggests that pumas occupy habitats where sufficient stalking cover and preferred prey are present, yet the intersection of these factors has rarely been assessed. Here we used data from 68 299 camera trap nights collected from 181 sites throughout the san francisco bay area over a four-year period to identify key predictors of habitat occupancy for pumas and their primary prey (mule deer odocoileus hemionus). Our goal was to determine whether pumas occupy habitats based on relative measures of prey availability (detection frequency), or ease of predation (density of stalking cover) and whether these predictors changed between seasons. Our results indicated that pumas primarily occupied forested habitats and did not choose habitats with abundant deer. Instead, pumas preferentially occupy habitats that facilitate their stalk and ambush hunting strategy, rather than higher prey densities, per se. The best occupancy models for mule deer indicated the importance of roads and shrub cover. However, even the best deer models performed poorly compared to the puma models, likely due to the ubiquity of mule deer in the region. Although prey density is a widely accepted correlate of habitat quality for many carnivores, our results suggest that structural elements of habitat may be a more important variable in predicting habitat use by large stalk and ambush predators like pumas, which has important implications for conservation success.

580,2020,"Towards more compassionate wildlife research through the 3rs principles: moving from invasive to non-invasive methods","Wildlife Biology","Research in ecology and wildlife biology remains crucial for increasing our knowledge and improving species management and conservation in the midst of the current biodiversity crisis. However, obtaining information on population status often involves invasive sampling of a certain number of individual animals. Marking and sampling practices include taking blood and tissue samples, toe-clipping of amphibians and rodents, or using implants and radio-transmitters-techniques that can negatively affect the animal. Wildlife research may then result in a fundamental conflict between individual animal welfare and the welfare of the population or ecosystem, which could be significantly reduced if non-invasive research practices were more broadly implemented. Implementation of non-invasive methods could be guided by the so-called 3rs principles for animal research (replace, reduce, refine), which were proposed by russell and burch 60 years ago and have become a part of many animal protection legislations worldwide. However, the process of incorporating the 3rs principles into wildlife research has been unfortunately rather slow and their importance overlooked. In order to help alleviate this situation, here i provide an overview of the most common practices in wildlife research, discuss their potential impact on animal welfare, and present available non-invasive alternatives.

We investigated the diet of a forest-dwelling frog species, morafka's frog (odorrana morafkai), in a highland forest in vietnam in relation to habitat disturbance, sex and season. We surveyed the species at 45 sites in forest of varying disturbance and examined its diet using stomach flushing, estimating prey availability via trapping. We detected significantly fewer o. Morafkai in highly disturbed habitats compared to moderately disturbed or non-disturbed habitats. We revealed that o. Morafkai is a dietary generalist, identifying 28 prey types, primarily invertebrates. Prey composition, the number of prey items per stomach and prey volume per stomach did not vary between disturbance levels. Diet did not vary significantly between sexes, except that females had a higher prey volume. Prey composition in the species varied between seasons, with coleoptera and orthoptera dominating the diet in the rainy season and lepidoptera in the dry season. The number of prey items per stomach and prey volume were significantly higher in the rainy season. There was a significant correlation between prey availability and diet composition. The low number of o. Morafkai detected in highly disturbed habitats suggests that this habitat may not be optimal for the species, despite having a generalist feeding strategy and presumed high mobility. This study provides a window into the impact of an increasing threat, habitat disturbance, on forest-dependent amphibian species.

582,2020,"Learning from local perceptions for strategic road development in cambodiaâs protected forests","Tropical Conservation Science","Road development in tropical forest landscapes is contentious. Local preferences are often subordinated to global economic and environmental concerns. Opportunities to seek solutions based on local context are rare. We examined local perspectives on road development within cambodiaâs keo seima wildlife sanctuary to explore opportunities for optimizing conservation and development outcomes. We conducted household surveys to document the perceived benefits and risks of road development. We found that in the sanctuary, road rehabilitation may accelerate transitions to intensified agriculture and diversified, off-farm incomes. All households prefer good roads and poorer households prioritize road development over other village infrastructure. Households perceive the most prominent benefit of roads to be access to hospital. Local government authorities are responsible for controlling land use and conversion within village boundaries and are therefore highly influential in determining the social and environmental outcomes of roads. Strategies to mitigate environmental risks of roads without constraining development benefits must focus on improving local capacity for decision-making and transparency. Local institutions in tropical forest landscapes must have greater control over development benefits if they are to reinvest assets to achieve conservation success.

583,2020,"Predicting strike susceptibility and collision patterns of the common buzzard at wind turbine structures in the federal state of brandenburg, germany","Plos One","With the increase in wind turbines, bird collisions have developed as a potential hazard. In the federal state of brandenburg, germany, despite the on-going mitigation efforts of increasing the distances of wind turbines from the breeding areas of the more severely affected populations of red kites (milvus milvus), the additional detrimental influences on the buzzard populations (buteo buteo) have added to the challenges for wind power expansion. Using data on the regional distribution of the buzzards, along with their carcass detections around the wind turbines (wts), we aimed to better understand their collision distribution patterns in relation to their habitat use patterns to predict their exposure to collision risk using boosted regression trees (brts). Additionally, we integrated the developed collision potential map with the regional density map of buzzards to identify areas of increased strike susceptibility in turbine installations. Our study showed that the buzzard collisions were primarily concentrated at the turbines situated at sensitive distances from the edges of watercourses (>1000 metres), as well as those along the edges of grasslands (>750 metres), in the green open areas around/areas with minimal settlements (750 metres-1750 metres), and along the edges of bushlands (>1500 metres), together explaining 58% of the variance in their collision distribution. Conclusively, our study is applicable to conservation because it demonstrates the identification of potential collision areas along with the causes of the collisions, in addition to demonstrating the benefits of incorporating a species collision dataset as a proxy for species presence into species distribution models to make informed management decisions to eventually combat biodiversity loss.

584,2020,"Multiple fragmented habitat-patch use in an urban breeding passerine, the short-toed treecreeper","Plos One","Individual responses of wild birds to fragmented habitat have rarely been studied, despite large-scale habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss resulting from widespread urbanisation. We investigated the spatial ecology of the short-toed treecreeper certhia brachydactyla, a tiny, resident, woodland passerine that has recently colonised city parks at the northern extent of its range. High resolution spatiotemporal movements of this obligate tree-living species were determined using radio telemetry within the urbanized matrix of city parks in copenhagen, denmark. We identified regular edge crossing behaviour, novel in woodland birds. While low numbers of individuals precluded a comprehensive characterisation of home range for this population, we were able to describe a consistent behaviour which has consequences for our understanding of animal movement in urban ecosystems. We report that treecreepers move freely, and apparently do so regularly, between isolated habitat patches. This behaviour is a possible driver of the range expansion in this species and may contribute to rapid dispersal capabilities in certain avian species, including short-toed treecreepers, into northern europe. Alternatively, these behaviours might be common and/or provide an adaptive advantage for birds utilising matrix habitats, for example within urban ecosystems. Â© 2020 snell et al.

585,2020,"Extinction debt of fishes in great lakes coastal wetlands","Biological Conservation","Declines in north american freshwater biodiversity can be largely attributed to anthropogenic disturbances that reduce habitat quantity, quality, and connectivity. In the laurentian great lakes, wetlands have been significantly lost as a result of agricultural land-use practice, yet high species richness and several at-risk fishes persist. These patterns lead to the hypothesis that great lakes wetland fishes are in extinction debt, meaning there is a time lag between habitat loss and local extinction. To test this hypothesis, we sampled current species richness of wetland-specialist fishes in protected and unprotected wetlands in the lake erie basin. We predicted species richness in unprotected wetlands using parameter estimates (slope and intercept) from protected wetlands. Extinction debt was measured as a positive difference between predicted and observed species richness. We determined how much area would be required to support current species richness and compared this to minimum-area requirements for eight at-risk fishes. Species richness was significantly higher than predicted in unprotected wetlands, indicating that fishes in them are in extinction debt. This result indicates that there is time available to restore disturbed wetlands and prevent local extinction. We identified 17 wetlands of high priority for restoration (>10 species bound for extinction) and determined that the restoration of 178 km2 of wetland habitat would reduce the risk of future biodiversity loss. This is the first direct study of extinction debt in freshwater fishes. Additional extinction-debt assessments in aquatic systems are needed to extend the ecological theory and fundamental application of extinction debt beyond terrestrial systems.

586,2020,"Habitat amount versus connectivity: an empirical study of bird responses","Biological Conservation","Habitat loss is widely acknowledged as a key driver of global biodiversity decline. However, whether biodiversity loss occurs in response to reductions in habitat amount versus reductions in connectivity in fragmented landscapes is debated. A challenge in resolving this issue is that measures of the amount of native woody vegetation cover and those calculated for structural connectivity are often highly correlated. Using multi-season detection-occupancy models we address the question: after accounting for the effects of native woody vegetation cover, what is the contribution of structural connectivity to site occupancy, site persistence and site colonization by birds? In this context, structural connectivity corresponded to the configuration of vegetation cover in the landscape surrounding our sites. We constructed multi-season detection-occupancy models for 44 individual bird species based on long-term field surveys in the temperate woodlands of eastern australia. We found responses to vegetation amount were far more prevalent than responses to structural connectivity (35 vs 6 species). The range of responses by different species to vegetation amount, to structural connectivity, or to both, suggests that these elements have different effects on the processes of occupancy, persistence and colonization. The predominance of vegetation amount effects in our study, particularly the positive effects for a range of species of conservation concern, suggests the critical importance of both conserving existing areas of native vegetation cover and increasing the amount of that cover. At least for birds, efforts to physically connect particular patches may have relatively less benefit compared to programs to boost overall vegetation cover.

587,2020,"Rubber agroforestry in thailand provides some biodiversity benefits without reducing yields","Journal Of Applied Ecology","Monocultural rubber plantations have replaced tropical forest, causing biodiversity loss. While protecting intact or semi-intact biodiverse forest is paramount, improving biodiversity value within the 11.4 million hectares of existing rubber plantations could offer important conservation benefits, if yields are also maintained. Some farmers practice agroforestry with high-yielding clonal rubber varieties to increase and diversify incomes. Here, we ask whether such rubber agroforestry improves biodiversity value or affects rubber yields relative to monoculture. We surveyed birds, fruit-feeding butterflies and reptiles in 25 monocultural and 39 agroforest smallholder rubber plots in thailand, the world's biggest rubber producer. Management and vegetation structure data were collected from each plot, and landscape composition around plots was quantified. Rubber yield data were collected for a separate set of 34 monocultural and 47 agroforest rubber plots in the same region. Reported rubber yields did not differ between agroforests and monocultures, meaning adoption of agroforestry in this context should not increase land demand for natural rubber. Butterfly richness was greater in agroforests, where richness increased with greater natural forest extent in the landscape. Bird and reptile richness were similar between agroforests and monocultures, but bird richness increased with the height of herbaceous vegetation inside rubber plots. Species composition of butterflies differed between agroforests and monocultures, and in response to natural forest extent, while bird composition was influenced by herbaceous vegetation height within plots, the density of non-rubber trees within plots (representing agroforestry complexity) and natural forest extent in the landscape. Reptile composition was influenced by canopy cover and open habitat extent in the landscape. Conservation priority and forest-dependent birds were not supported within rubber. Synthesis and applications. Rubber agroforestry using clonal varieties provides modest biodiversity benefits relative to monocultures, without compromising yields. Agroforests may also generate ecosystem service and livelihood benefits. Management of monocultural rubber production to increase inter-row vegetation height and complexity may further benefit biodiversity. However, biodiversity losses from encroachment of rubber onto forests will not be offset by rubber agroforestry or rubber plot management. This evidence is important for developing guidelines around biodiversity-friendly rubber and sustainable supply chains, and for farmers interested in diversifying rubber production.

The use of social media data and other online data sources is increasing in conservation science. We collected social media and online news data pertaining to rhinoceros, which are iconic species especially threatened by illegal wildlife trade, and assessed online sentiment towards these species using natural language processing methods. We also used an outlier detection technique to identify the most prominent conservation-related events imprinted into this data. We found that tragic events, such as the death of the last male northern white rhinoceros, sudan, in march 2018, triggered the strongest reactions, which appeared to be concentrated in western countries, outside rhinoceros range states. We also found a strong temporal cross-correlation between social media data volume and online news volume in relation to tragic events, while other events only appeared in either social media or online news. Our results highlight that the public is concerned about biodiversity loss and this, in turn, can be used to increase pressure on decision makers to develop adequate conservation actions that can help reverse the biodiversity crisis. The proposed methods and analyses can be used to infer sentiment towards any biodiversity topic from digital media data, and to detect which events are perceived most important to the public.

589,2020,"The cecil moment: celebrity environmentalism, nature 2.0, and the cultural politics of lion trophy hunting","Geoforum","In 2015 cecil the lion's death sparked international furore over the practice of lion trophy hunting. Celebrities and everyday citizens, traditional news and social media alike were aflame around the globe, most notably after american celebrity jimmy kimmel expressed disgust in cecil's death during a monologue on his late-night talk show. This paper explores the cecil moment as a case study of the cultural politics of the environment at the intersection of celebrity environmentalism and ânature 2.0â applications like facebook and twitter. The research asks: what can the cecil moment can tell us about how celebrity and nature 2.0 environmentalisms work and to what kind of conservation politics do they lead? Drawing on the celebrity environmentalism and nature 2.0 literatures, i develop an analytic framework for analyzing the cecil moment which considers and evaluates the network of actors enrolled, the representations foregrounded and backgrounded, as well as the outcomes. Empirical insights are drawn from document and media review, and key informant interviews. I argue that the cecil moment operated through a more-than-human network which served to channel agency unleashed by cecil's death to the already-empowered lion conservation actors, as well as mutable meanings that shifted cecil moment focus away from trophy hunting and toward lion conservation in general. Ultimately, the cecil moment operated to dismiss the anti-trophy hunting politics that sparked and fuelled it in the first place; yet, the momentum of the cecil moment was grasped and re-directed toward other lion conservation priorities. Critically, this re-direction was not neutral; rather, it shifted the politics of the cecil moment in a way that reproduced longstanding patterns of conservation injustice wherein blame for biodiversity loss is directed away from powerful forces onto the racialized, rural poor from the global south.

590,2020,"When are extinctions simply bad luck? Rarefaction as a framework for disentangling selective and stochastic extinctions","Journal Of Applied Ecology","A key challenge in conservation biology is that not all species are equally likely to go extinct when faced with a disturbance, but there are multiple overlapping reasons for such differences in extinction probability. Differences in species extinction risk may represent extinction selectivity, a non-random process by which speciesâ risks of extinction are caused by differences in fitness based on traits. Additionally, rare species with low abundances and/or occupancies are more likely to go extinct than common species for reasons of random chance alone, that is, bad luck. Unless ecologists and conservation biologists can disentangle random and selective extinction processes, then the prediction and prevention of future extinctions will continue to be an elusive challenge. We suggest that a modified version of a common null model procedure, rarefaction, can be used to disentangle the influence of stochastic species loss from selective non-random processes. To this end we applied a rarefaction-based null model to three published data sets to characterize the influence of species rarity in driving biodiversity loss following three biodiversity loss events: (a) disease-associated bat declines; (b) disease-associated amphibian declines; and (c) habitat loss and invasive species-associated gastropod declines. For each case study, we used rarefaction to generate null expectations of biodiversity loss and species-specific extinction probabilities. In each of our case studies, we find evidence for both random and non-random (selective) extinctions. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly considering that some species extinctions are the result of stochastic processes. In other words, we find significant evidence for bad luck in the extinction process. Policy implications. Our results suggest that rarefaction can be used to disentangle random and non-random extinctions and guide management decisions. For example, rarefaction can be used retrospectively to identify when declines of at-risk species are likely to result from selectivity, versus random chance. Rarefaction can also be used prospectively to formulate minimum predictions of species loss in response to hypothetical disturbances. Given its minimal data requirements and familiarity among ecologists, rarefaction may be an efficient and versatile tool for identifying and protecting species that are most vulnerable to global extinction.

591,2020,"Predicting biodiversity loss in island and countryside ecosystems through the lens of taxonomic and functional biogeography","Ecography","We investigate how variation in patch area and forest cover quantified for three different spatial scales (buffer size of 500, 1500 and 3000 m radius) affects species richness and functional diversity of bat assemblages in two ecosystems differing in fragmentâmatrix contrast: a landbridge island system in panama and a countryside ecosystem in the brazilian amazon. Bats were sampled on 11 islands and the adjacent mainland in panama, and in eight forest fragments and nearby continuous forest in brazil. Speciesâarea relationships (sar) were assessed based on chao1 species richness estimates, and functional diversityâarea relationships (far) were quantified using chao1 functional diversity estimates measured as the total branch length of a trait dendrogram. Fars were calculated using three trait sets: considering five species functional traits (farall), and trait subsets reflecting âdiet breadthâ (fardiet) and âdispersal abilityâ (fardispersal). We found that in both study systems, farall was less sensitive to habitat loss than sar, in the sense that an equal reduction in habitat loss led to a disproportionately smaller loss of functional diversity compared to species richness. However, the inhospitable and static aquatic matrix in the island ecosystem resulted in more pronounced species loss with increasing loss of habitat compared to the countryside ecosystem. Moreover, while we found a significant fardispersal for the island ecosystem in relation to forest cover within 500 m landscape buffers, fardiet and fardispersal were not significant for the countryside ecosystem. Our findings highlight that species richness and functional diversity in island and countryside ecosystems scale fundamentally differently with habitat loss, and suggest that key bat ecological functions, such as pollination, seed dispersal and arthropod suppression, may be maintained in fragments despite a reduction in species richness. Our study reinforces the importance of increasing habitat availability for decreasing the chances of losing species richness in smaller fragments. Â© 2019 the authors.

In view of the east kolkata wetlands (ekw), india, this paper has examined the trend, causes, extent and impacts of landscape transformation during the last few decades. Hence we aim to present a review of several studies in and around ekw and suggests a sustainable model for ekw. This âramsar site of international importanceâ is one of the world's largest wastewater-fed aquaculture systems where the city sewage is recycled for pisciculture and agriculture, and acts as flood resistance for the city of kolkata. Rapid encroachment in the ekw due to unplanned development has caused various environmental, social and economic impacts. The key ecological impacts found in the study included loss of faunal and floral diversity, eco-toxicological impacts, etc. In terms of biodiversity loss, while the number of bird species in the ekw decreased from 248 in 1960s to 72 in 2005, about 59% fish species are near threats, vulnerable and endangered. Reported persistent organic pollutants (pops) around the ekw region were found to pose deleterious impact on environment and ambient biota. Several studies have evidenced that the open burning of solid waste in the dumping ground of dhapa is a potential source of polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) and polychlorinated dibenzo dioxin/furans (pcdd/fs). Further the ecological transformation of the ekw focussing on policy development and regulatory compliance issues has been studied in this paper. The aspects of encroachment and wetland shrinkage triggered by economic drivers like urban sprawl have been analyzed. The paper presents adaptive co-management as the future roadmap for action to curb further degradation of the wetlands, and adopt an integrated approach of environmental, political, physical, economic and institutional aspects. It is envisaged that the adaptive co-management model will contribute to long-term sustainable sustenance of this precious ecosystem.

We searched and surveyed for the giant armadillo within human-modified areas in central brazil using direct and indirect methods across a wide region dominated by diverse farming environments and scattered remnants of natural vegetation. During a 14-year period (2003-2016, we located 54 records of the species, including three road-kills and two instances of poaching. Most of the occurrence points (83%) were in native vegetation, with 17% in anthropogenic environments (pastures and roads). We confirmed the presence of the giant armadillo within a wide, intensely humanaltered region. These findings indicate that cerrado and atlantic forest remnants in modified landscapes in central brazil play an important role as refuges for this armadillo species. In addition to habitat loss, road-kills and poaching persist as threats to the giant armadillo. Conservation actions are necessary to minimize human impacts and facilitate the persistence of the giant armadillo in this region. Policies that both deter illegal deforestation and strengthen incentives for the protection of natural vegetation remnants and restoration of biological corridors such as gallery forests would aid conservation of the giant armadillo in this area.
