The area is recognized for its high biodiversity exemplified by the presence of at least 13 lemur species in forests surrounding the mine site. In order to reduce potential habitat fragmentation impacts on the lemur populations as a consequence of recent access road construction, seven crossing structures (referred to as 'lemur bridges') were erected within the mine footprint area and along the slurry pipeline that will remain in place until rehabilitated forest allows for movement over roads via the forest canopy. Two bridge designs were used due to differences in road width and vehicle traffic type. Lemur bridges have been monitored since their construction in January-February 2009. To date (10 August 2010), bridges have been used by six lemur species. Mine footprint type bridges (suspension bridge design) have been used more frequently than slurry pipeline bridges (plank bridge design) and, overall, there has been an increase in bridge use in 2010 when compared to 2009 (from 8% to 24% of total observations where lemurs are present in proximity to bridges). These results suggest that although a certain time period may be required for lemurs to locate and habituate to bridges, these crossing structures offer an effective mitigation measure to assist in reducing the impacts of habitat fragmentation.","Lemur bridges provide crossing structures over roads within a forested mining concession near Moramanga, Toamasina Province, Madagascar",0

The results indicate that tunnels are an effective means of mitigating the effects of all types of new road schemes on badgers; 89% of the tunnels monitored were used. The results suggest that no one factor is of over-riding importance in tunnel design; however, design features that appeared to be associated with the use of tunnels were good vegetation cover, habitat connectivity, good drainage and a tunnel width of at least 600 mm.","Use of badger tunnels on Highway Agency schemes in England",1
"CE_2350","CE",2350,2011,NA,"Conservation Evidence","A total of 196 bat boxes were installed between 2005 and 2009 across 21 sites throughout the Highways Agency's (HA) 'soft estate' woodland in north-east England in support of the HA's Biodiversity Action Plan. The woodlands are typically small linear blocks (<3 ha) with trees mostly less than 40 years of age. Suitable natural cavity sites are thus very limited, hence the attractiveness of bat boxes as a conservation measure to enhance these woodland habitats. Monitoring in 2006-2007 had shown that in some areas (seven woodland sites) over 40% of bat boxes were being used by nesting passerine birds. Bird boxes were installed in an attempt to reduce bird occupancy of bat boxes. Provision of bird boxes significantly reduced bird use of bat boxes (a 50% overall reduction in occupancy) thus potentially making more bat boxes available for bat use. We also assessed if there was any relationship between the number/density of available bat boxes and level of bat occupancy to assess if there was a limit to the occupancy levels that could be achieved, thus determining an approach that could maximise benefits and cost effectiveness of box installation. Occupancy of bat boxes by bats appears not to increase above 30% utilisation with an increasing number of boxes on site after eight boxes. This suggests that, as bat boxes are installed three boxes per tree (as per best practice guidelines), the optimal number to install would generally be between nine to 12 boxes in these small woodland areas.","Managing competition between birds and bats for roost boxes in small woodlands, north-east England",0

An adder bank (hibernacula) was constructed in the autumn 2009 in advance of flood defence works at Horsey in 2010 to mitigate any temporary loss of hibernation and natal den sites. Reptile fencing was erected around the adder banks and some adjacent grazing marshes in February 2010 to create reptile enclosures. During March to May 2010, 119 adders were moved to the adder banks from the flood banks that were then stripped of vegetation and topsoil to discourage animals from re-entering the working corridor. Sections of the adder fencing were removed in mid-May to allow animals to disperse to their summer foraging grounds. Surveys during summer 2010 indicated breeding success within the banks. Pre hibernation surveys in 2010 recorded a peak count of 22 animals, and a spring emergence survey of the adder bank in 2011 identified 17 individual adders. A further four were recorded using an adjacent store of rush, Juncus, bales. Monitoring through summer and autumn 2011 identified a further 16 individual animals on or close to the adder bank, including six gravid adders. Eighteen out of the 33 adders recorded using the adder banks in 2011 were recaptures. Fifteen 'new' adders (i.e. not relocated during the 2010 mitigation) were subsequently identified as using the adder banks to hibernate or give birth.

Given its vulnerability, it was considered desirable to establish additional sub-populations to ensure the long-term survival of the species. A spatial meta-population simulation of grand skinks at Macraes Flat suggested that this could be facilitated by the translocation of grand skinks into areas of predator protected habitat. Areas identified by modeling as suitable translocation sites were ground-truthed by an experienced survey team in 2008. In October 2009 we began a translocation trial. We moved nineteen grand skinks from three locations to the translocation site. The founder population was made up of ten juveniles and nine sexually mature grand skinks. Seasonal estimation of persistence and abundance using a photographic re-sight methodology allowed the short- and medium-term performance of the translocation to be assessed. High initial persistence rates suggested immediate homing was not a factor of concern. After one year, all translocated juveniles had persisted, but only four of the original nine adults remained at the release site. While the loss of adults was to some extent offset by the birth of the young-of-the-year (total skinks start: n = 19, finish: n = 20) there was a moderate loss of ~ 10% in terms of the population's expected reproductive value. Overall, we viewed the outcome as favorable and on that basis undertook a follow up translocation.","A trial wild-wild translocation of the critically endangered grand skink <i>Oligosoma grande</i> in Otago, New Zealand",0

Risk of injury to endemic San Nicolas Island foxes Urocyon littoralis dickeyi, a similarly sized and more abundant non-target species, was mitigated by using a smaller trap size, modifying the trap and trap set to reduce injuries, and utilising a trap monitoring system to reduce time animals spent in traps. Impacts to foxes during the eradication campaign were further reduced by having a mobile veterinary hospital on island to treat injured foxes. Compared to other reported fox trapping efforts, serious injuries were reduced 2-7 times. Trapping efforts exceeded animal welfare standards, with 95% of fox captures resulting in minor or no injuries. Older foxes were more likely to receive serious injury. Fox captures were also reduced through aversive conditioning, with initial capture events providing a negative stimulus to prevent recaptures. Fox capture rates decreased up to six times during seven months of trapping, increasing trap availability for cats, and improving the efficacy of the cat eradication program.

In attempts to mitigate ecosystem damage associated with extensive landscape alteration, vast tracks of upland croplands have been returned to perennial vegetative cover (i.e., conservation grasslands) under a variety of U.S. Department of Agriculture programs. We evaluated the influence of these conservation grasslands on amphibian occupancy of seasonal wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region. Using automated call surveys, aquatic funnel traps, and visual encounter surveys, we detected eight amphibian species using wetlands within three land-use categories (farmed, conservation grasslands, and native prairie grasslands) during the summers of 2005 and 2006. Seasonal wetlands within farmlands were used less frequently by amphibians than those within conservation and native prairie grasslands, and wetlands within conservation grasslands were used less frequently than those within native prairie grasslands by all species and life-stages we successfully modeled.

Reintroduction efforts from captive assurance colonies are unlikely to be successful without the development of methods to control chytridiomycosis in the wild. In an effort to develop a protective treatment regimen, we treated golden frogs with Janthinobacterium lividum, a skin bacterium that has been used to experimentally prevent chytridiomycosis in North American amphibians. Although J. lividum appeared to colonize A. zeteki skin temporarily, it did not prevent or delay mortality in A. zeteki exposed to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the causative agent of chytridiomycosis. After introduction of J. lividum, average bacterial cell counts reached a peak of 1.7 × 10(6) cells per frog ~2 weeks after treatment but declined steadily after that. When J. lividum numbers declined to ~2.8 × 10(5) cells per frog, B. dendrobatidis infection intensity increased to greater than 13,000 zoospore equivalents per frog. At this point, frogs began to die of chytridiomycosis. Future research will concentrate on isolating and testing antifungal bacterial species from Panama that may be more compatible with Atelopus skin.","Towards a better understanding of the use of probiotics for preventing chytridiomycosis in Panamanian golden frogs",0

We monitored movements of 36 captive-reared Ozark Hellbenders (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi) released to augment wild populations at two sites on the North Fork of the White River (Missouri, USA). We used radiotelemetry to collect 3610 Hellbender locations from May 2008 to August 2009. We quantified movements at multiple spatio-temporal scales and made comparisons between two seasons of monitoring (1 = release-December 2008; 2 = January 2009-August 2009). At the finest (daily) scale, most Hellbenders (90%-94% per season) were highly sedentary (=50 of observations indicated no movement). Typical distances between daily locations when Hellbenders moved were <5 m in Season 1 (median = 3.08 m, n = 331; range 0.19-903.00) and <2 m in Season 2 (median = 1.80 m; n = 161; range = 0.21-34.00). During the study Hellbenders rarely (35 of 492 movements) travelled >20 m between daily locations, and virtually all (34 of 35) such movements occurred in Season 1. At a broader scale, home ranges of Hellbenders varied widely in Season 1 (range = 0.66-986.92 m2, n = 26), but in Season 2 averaged only 31.33 m2 (± 11.81 SE, n = 8) and 11.08 m2 (± 3.25 SE, n = 7) at respective sites. Among Hellbenders monitored long enough to exhibit settlement (estimation of a home range) 69% (18 of 26) dispersed =50 m from the point of release. We only noted mortality associated with dispersals >50 m at one site, when it coincided with abandonment of core habitat that was one-third as large as at the other site. At the broadest scale, 68% and 86% of Hellbenders settled in core habitat of respective release sites, and most had settled within 21 d postrelease (range = 0-49 d). Collectively, Hellbender movements indicated a short period of exploration followed by more permanent settlement and high site fidelity typical of wild conspecifics.

Ignoring this issue may conduct to misleading conclusions. Here we show that data collected by different volunteer groups can be integrated with measures of sampling efforts, to obtain information on large scale demographic trends. We collected data on 33 common toad (Bufo bufo) populations across Italy for the period 1993-2010. We used two approaches (meta-analysis; analysis of average change in population size) to evaluate the overall demographic trend. We incorporated measures of volunteer sampling efforts into analyses, to take into account changes in detection probability. Toad abundance significantly declined in the last decade. From 2000 to 2010, 70% of populations showed a strong decline, and only 10% increased. Trends were heterogeneous among populations, but taking into account sampling effort reduced heterogeneity by 40%. We detected a 76% cumulative average decline of toad populations, despite an increasing mean sampling effort. The widespread toad decline rises concern for its future, also because the causes remain unclear.

Anuran observations were conducted using nocturnal audible call surveys and dip netting. Univariate results indicated that: the lowest species richness and relative abundance values occurred within the un-restored areas, richness significantly increased in all restored areas relative to un-restored areas, abundance increased in some restored areas but not others, and highest richness and abundance were documented in the natural wetlands. Multivariate analysis confirmed these patterns and also indicated that the anuran species assemblages were significantly different between restoration treatments. Furthermore, the presence or absence of Lithobates sphenocephalus utricularius (Southern Leopard Frog), Gastrophryne carolinensis (Eastern Narrow-mouthed Toad), and Hyla femoralis (Pine Woods Treefrog) may be used to document restoration success or hydrologic disturbance, respectively.

However, the effects of silvicultural treatments on amphibians may not be realized until many years after treatment. Manipulative forest management experiments with pre- and post-treatment data, random assignment of replicates to treatments, and analyses over a large spatial scale are rare in the literature. Furthermore, even studies with pre- and post-treatment data can be affected by ecological time lags; the longevity of some species may mean that it could take several years to observe a treatment effect.

Our study investigated the efficacy, 2 and 10. years post-logging, of two different riparian management zone prescriptions established around third- and fourth-order streams in western Washington to mitigate the effects of upland timber harvest on amphibians. Our findings suggest that there is no global response by terrestrial amphibians to logging or to the retention of riparian management zones. Rather, species showed individual responses that varied over time and between treatments and transects. Specifically Coastal Tailed Frogs (.

To examine the effect of short-term vegetative regrowth post-harvesting on amphibian habitat use, we studied the response of eight species (four forest specialists and four habitat generalists) to four forestry treatments (partial harvest, clearcut with coarse woody debris [CWD] removed, clearcut with CWD retained, and uncut control) over a 6-year period, using replicated experimental treatments in Maine, USA. Forest amphibians showed a strong negative response to clearcutting through the duration of the study, regardless of the presence of CWD, but only during the post-breeding season (i.e., summer). The spring breeding migrations of wood frogs and spotted salamanders to experimental pools were not affected by the forestry treatments. The use of partial cut treatments by forest amphibians differed between animals emerging from experimental pools (i.e., juvenile wood frogs and spotted salamanders), and animals originating from outside the experimental arrays (i.e., adults of all forest species, juvenile wood frogs and spotted salamanders). Animals emerging from our experimental pools showed no difference in the use of control and partial cut treatments, while all the other animals preferred control plots. In addition, we found a modest increase in the use of clearcuts over the 6. years following harvesting by juvenile wood frogs from experimental pools (from an 8-fold difference between forest and clearcut treatments in the first year post-clearcutting to a 3-fold difference during years 3-5). However, this increase was not significantly associated with vegetation regrowth. Forest specialists declined in abundance in all treatments beginning 2-3. years post-disturbance. Despite high yearly fluctuations in abundance, there was a shift in relative abundance towards habitat generalist species, most notably green frog juveniles. Most habitat generalist species were not affected by clearcutting or vegetative regrowth; however, we observed a lower use of clearcut treatments by green frogs starting 3. years post-harvesting, perhaps due to an increase in habitat resistance to movements associated with vegetative regrowth. These general patterns of habitat use were overridden at the local scale by site-specific variation in the use of forestry treatments, most evident in emigrating juvenile wood frogs. From a management standpoint, implementing broad silvicultural prescriptions could be a viable strategy in extensively forested landscapes, but local variation in habitat use has to be acknowledged when managers focus on a limited area. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","The role of forest harvesting and subsequent vegetative regrowth in determining patterns of amphibian habitat use",0

Larval survival of both species was affected by the presence of a buffer zone, with increased survival for cricket frogs and decreased survival for green frogs when reared in ponds with buffer zones.

To evaluate the amphibian colonization dynamics of artificial MTPs in the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, we monitored two artificial MTPs (one in a high-diversity area and the other in a low-diversity area) over 2 years. We selected reference wetlands at each area, and amphibian communities of man-made MTPs were compared to those of reference wetlands. We found that, beginning in the first year, artificial MTPs were a valuable habitat for regional amphibian fauna. Posteriorly, we focused on the reproductive success of the natterjack toad, Bufo calamita.

Since its discovery, research has been focused on developing various methods of mitigating the impact of chytridiomycosis on amphibian hosts but little attention has been given to the role of antifungal agents that could be added to the host's environment. Sodium chloride is a known antifungal agent used routinely in the aquaculture industry and this study investigates its potential for use as a disease management tool in amphibian conservation. The effect of 0-5 ppt NaCl on the growth, motility and survival of the chytrid fungus when grown in culture media and its effect on the growth, infection load and survivorship of infected Peron's tree frogs (Litoria peronii) in captivity, was investigated. The results reveal that these concentrations do not negatively affect the survival of the host or the pathogen. However, concentrations greater than 3 ppt significantly reduced the growth and motility of the chytrid fungus compared to 0 ppt. Concentrations of 1-4 ppt NaCl were also associated with significantly lower host infection loads while infected hosts exposed to 3 and 4 ppt NaCl were found to have significantly higher survival rates. These results support the potential for NaCl to be used as an environmentally distributed antifungal agent for the prevention of chytridiomycosis in susceptible amphibian hosts.

However, salamander responses to timber harvest vary considerably from one study to the next - some studies have shown limited or no effects whereas others have found harvest-related declines of up to 95%. To estimate overall effect sizes of timber harvest on salamander populations and to examine factors that contribute to variation in salamander responses to harvest, we carried out a meta-analysis of published studies of the effects of timber harvesting on terrestrial salamander abundance. Based on 108 salamander species/treatment combinations from 24 studies, we found mean harvest-related declines ranged from 29% (95% CI = -2% to 51%) for long-term responses to partial canopy removal to 62% (95% CI = 29% to 80%) for short-term responses to clearcutting. Multivariate mixed models suggested that clearcutting had a modestly greater impact on salamander populations than partial harvest and that decreases following harvest were more pronounced at sites with warmer summer high temperatures. In addition, active sampling of salamanders (e.g., surface counts) led to greater apparent effects of timber harvest than passive sampling (e.g., cover boards or pitfall traps), suggesting that sampling methodology influenced the perceived effects of harvest. In the studies evaluated, salamander numbers almost always declined following timber removal, but salamanders were never extirpated and populations typically increased as forests regenerated. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Meta-analysis of the effects of canopy removal on terrestrial salamander populations in North America",0

We investigated bat movements across a motorway where it intersects with potential bat commuting routes along prominent linear landscape elements (treelines along hedgerows, minor roads, and rivers). Bat activity was recorded acoustically at four types of potential crossing routes; two under-motorway routes (river bridges and underpasses) and two over-motorway routes (overbridges and severed treelines), while simultaneously recording activity in the adjacent habitat. Bat activity above and below motorway structures and the timing of crossing flights with respect to motorway vehicles were also recorded. All bat species recorded in the adjacent landscape crossed the motorway. Bats used under-motorway routes, particularly river bridges, more than over-motorway routes. Contrary to expectations, many species flew across motorway gaps in treelines despite the lack of a guiding structure, including clutter-adapted species (Myotis spp., Plecotus auritus). Furthermore, bat passes were also recorded for the more collision-prone flight route at crossing structures (2% and 6.4% recorded above motorway level at river bridges and underpasses respectively, and 50% recorded on the underside of overbridges). In a subset of 10 nights of motorway-edge recordings, 18.3% of bat passes coincided with, and 17.1% were within 1-5. s of, passing vehicles.

Under-road passageways may reduce these impacts, but little is known about the ecological factors influencing their use by bats. The study area provided a natural experimental design, in that adjacent under-motorway passageways had contrasting dimensions (two long, narrow drainage pipes within <1km of a large underpass for a minor road), and local bat species had contrasting functional and morphological adaptations. We predicted that inter-species differences in flight capability and sensory perception would influence bat use of passageways. All-night acoustic recordings of bat activity inside passageways (52 nights) indicated clear guild-specific responses to passageway dimensions. Only Rhinolophus hipposideros, Myotis nattereri and Plecotus auritus flew through the narrow drainage pipes. These species are adapted for flight and foraging in cluttered airspace, in terms of wing morphology and echolocation signal design. Edge-space species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus) were highly active in the area but never flew through the narrow pipes. All species, except the open-adapted Nyctalus leisleri, flew through the large underpass. Simultaneous recordings made above and below this underpass (16 nights) also indicated that species' tendency to cross over, rather than under, the structure was inversely related to the degree of clutter-adaptation. If motorways are built through bat habitat, trade-offs between optimal mitigation of impacts on protected bats and cost/engineering practicality are inevitable. Large underpasses are advisable where possible as they accommodate a wider range of species, and bats are less likely to fly over them. However, their construction is costly and is dependent on landscape topology.

However, little is known about the influence of fire periodicity on many of the wildlife species occupying these forests. Our goal was to determine the relative degree to which a forest's structural characteristics and insect abundance and biomass influence the activity of different ecomorphological guilds of insectivorous bats and whether either of these factors was influenced by the periodicity of prescribed fire. We conducted a 2-year echolocation-monitoring study of bats in sandhills forests experiencing 3 categories of fire periodicity: 1 - 2 years, 3 - 5 years, and >8 years. We found significant differences in tree, shrub, and ground-layer characteristics among these burn-frequency categories, but few differences in abundance or biomass of most orders of nocturnal insects. However, the biomass of Lepidoptera was greatest at sites with the longest time between burns and was positively associated with fire-dependent deciduous tree and shrub densities. Bat activity below the canopy was significantly lower in the sites with >8-year burn frequencies than in either of the other treatments and was positively associated with height of canopy closure (a fire-dependent variable). Species-specific activity patterns confirmed ecomorphological predictions. Small-bodied species with low wing loadings and aspect ratios replaced larger, less-maneuverable species below the canopy at sites with >8-year burn frequencies.

However, through lack of appropriate monitoring, there is little evidence to support their effectiveness. Three underpasses and four bat gantries were investigated in northern England. Echolocation call recordings and observations were used to determine the number of bats using underpasses in preference to crossing the road above, and the height at which bats crossed. At gantries, proximity to the gantry and height of crossing bats were measured. Data were compared to those from adjacent, severed commuting routes that had no crossing structure. At one underpass 96% of bats flew through it in preference to crossing the road. This underpass was located on a pre-construction commuting route that allowed bats to pass without changing flight height or direction. At two underpasses attempts to divert bats from their original commuting routes were unsuccessful and bats crossed the road at the height of passing vehicles. Underpasses have the potential to allow bats to cross roads safely if built on pre-construction commuting routes. Bat gantries were ineffective and used by a very small proportion of bats, even up to nine years after construction. Most bats near gantries crossed roads along severed, pre-construction commuting routes at heights that put them in the path of vehicles. Crossing height was strongly correlated with verge height, suggesting that elevated verges may have some value in mitigation, but increased flight height may be at the cost of reduced permeability.

Overall levels of bat activity and the abundance of their insect prey (mainly Diptera and Trichoptera) were lower (by 40-50%) on farms participating in AES than on non-participating farms.

Richness of forest bats was the same across all land-use types; in contrast, species richness of open-space bats increased in low shade, intensively managed coffee plantations. Conversely, only forest bats demonstrated significant differences in ensemble structure (as measured by similarity indices) across land-use types. Both overall activity and feeding activity of forest bats declined significantly with increasing management intensity, while the overall activity, but not feeding activity, of open-space bats increased. We conclude that diverse shade coffee plantations in our study area serve as valuable foraging and commuting habitat for aerial insectivorous bats, and several species also commute through or forage in low shade coffee monocultures. © 2011 Williams-Guillén, Perfecto.","Ensemble composition and activity levels of insectivorous bats in response to management intensification in coffee agroforestry systems",1

In December 2011, the ash tree was accidentally felled by contract staff operating on behalf of the landowner whilst carrying out ride habitat and tree safety management as the tree was considered to be a public safety concern. A mitigation and compensation strategy was implemented, with a noctule maternity colony returning in 2012 and 2013.

In contrast, adoption of rotational grazing is thought to benefit biodiversity in pastures but there are few supporting data. We examined the response of native plants, birds and reptiles to livestock management in south-eastern Australia. We selected 12 pairs of rotationally and continuously grazed farms. Two 1-ha plots were established in native pastures on each farm, one cleared and the second still retaining woodland tree cover. Stocking rates, fertilizer histories and landscape tree cover varied among farms. The abundance and richness of all taxa was lower in cleared pastures. The less mobile organisms (reptiles and plants) were positively correlated with tree cover at landscape scales, but only when trees were present at the plot scale. This pattern was driven by a few observations in landscapes with approximately 50% tree canopy cover. Neither bird abundance nor richness was correlated with stocking rates or nutrient enrichment, but plant richness responded negatively to both. The response of reptiles varied, declining with nutrient enrichment but positively correlated with livestock densities. These responses may be partly interpreted within the context of prior filtering of species pools through long-term grazing pressure. No taxa responded positively to rotational grazing management. We predict that reductions in livestock density and soil nutrients will directly benefit plants and less so reptiles, but not birds. Indirect benefits are predicted for birds and reptiles if management increases persistence of trees within paddocks. Although some forms of rotational grazing can increase woodland tree recruitment, rotational grazing in itself is unlikely to enhance diversity. © 2012 The Authors.

To investigate whether hair eating could be reduced through changes in diet, a 2-part study was conducted with a group of baboons (Papio hamadryas sp.). The 1st part involved changing to a twice-daily feeding routine, thus providing prolonged access to an appropriate food source. The 2nd part involved scattering a grain mix to encourage more foraging while maintaining a once-daily feeding routine. Changing the feeding routine unexpectedly resulted in a significant increase in hair manipulation and ingestion. Providing additional grain did not significantly decrease hair manipulation and ingestion, but several individuals did show a reduction in these behaviors. Prolonged access to biscuits and the provision of a grain mix may have failed to satisfy the urge to forage because little effort was needed for their collection prior to consumption.

Behavior was recorded for 30min before (baseline) and 30min after the start of each treatment.

In Set-up Enriched, dominant animals had the greatest increase in foraging (P=0.03), partly because they generally monopolized the suspended items, but this allowed others to forage at ground level. This separation of the animals likely explains why Set-Up Enriched led to more foraging than all other treatments (P80.05).

Despite the growing availability of such information an over-reliance on commercially available primate foods and fruit continues in many captive establishments. Wild slender lorises are almost exclusively insectivorous, yet captive conspecifics are fed a primarily frugivorous diet that is likely to contribute to behavioral and health problems. We investigated the effect of naturalizing diet in the Northern Ceylon grey slender loris (Loris lydekkerianus nordicus) by providing live insect prey to a captive group of five individuals. We calculated activity budgets in accordance with six established categories and recorded positional behaviors. We collected data over 30 hours for each of three conditions: pre-enrichment, enrichment, post-enrichment. We hypothesized that increased opportunity for the display of natural behaviors would be stimulated by the dietary enrichment of live insects and made the following predictions; 1) Percentage time spent foraging would increase and time spent inactive would decrease; 2) behavioral repertoires would increase; 3) foraging patterns would be more constant over time with reduced feeding-time peaks. We analyzed time budget and behavioral changes using Friedman tests. We found significant changes in activity budgets with inactivity reduced and foraging levels increased to levels seen in wild slender lorises. We found a significant increase in postures used in foraging and a wider behavioral repertoire. We discuss the benefits of providing free-ranging live food in relation to enhancing the temporal-spatial distribution of food acquisition, satisfying nutritional requirements, balancing energy intake, and expenditure, expanding sensory stimulation, and promoting behavioral competence.

Determining this is important for assessing progress toward restoration goals and, more generally, for gaining insight into ecosystem functioning and dynamics. We studied this question as it relates to mid- to large-sized terrestrial fauna in restored riparian habitats at the Sacramento River National Wildlife Refuge, in northern California. We used camera traps to document use of 16 riparian corridor sites of varying restoration age. Comparisons of species richness (diversity) and visitation frequency (activity) were made across different-aged sites. We found that predator diversity and activity levels tended to be higher in restored forests than in remnant forests, and that they tended to be highest in young restored forests. This trend persisted when data from variable sampling periods were pooled, although significant differences occurred more often in wet and cold sampling periods. The trend did not always hold for the animal community at large (consisting of both predator and non-predator species). We conclude that restoration age affects predator diversity and activity levels in restored and remnant floodplain forests, and that predator communities can establish soon after restoration. Our results suggest that restoring natural river processes that promote habitat regeneration may benefit mid- to large-sized terrestrial predators that appear to mostly use early successional habitat.","Response of medium- and large-sized terrestrial fauna to corridor restoration along the middle Sacramento River",0

Small terrestrial vertebrates, many of which are adapted to open desert habitats, are declining. One hypothesis is that the invasive plants contribute to the decline by altering vegetative structure. Although cattle may have originally been a factor in the establishment of these non-native plants, their grazing may benefit the terrestrial vertebrates by maintaining an open structure, especially during average or wet winters when the exotic grasses grow especially dense. We experimentally tested the effect of cattle grazing on invasive plants and a community of small vertebrates at a site in the southwestern San Joaquin Desert. We established and monitored 4 treatment (grazed) and 4 control (ungrazed) plots from 1997 to 2006, and assessed the abundances of blunt-nosed leopard lizards (Gambelia sila), giant kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ingens), short-nosed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys nitratoides nitratoides), and San Joaquin antelope squirrels (Ammospermophilus nelsoni), all of which are listed as threatened or endangered by state or federal agencies. We also recorded abundances of the non-protected western whiptail lizards (Aspidoscelis tigris), side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana), San Joaquin pocket mice (Perognathus inornatus inornatus), and Heermann's kangaroo rats (Dipdomys heermanni). Based on repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a 0.05 alpha level, only Heermann's kangaroo rats showed a treatment effect; they were more abundant on the control plots. However, this effect could be accounted for by the natural re-establishment of saltbush (Atriplex spp.) on part of the study site. Saltbush return also favored western whiptail lizards and San Joaquin antelope squirrels. A regression analysis indicated that populations of blunt-nosed leopard lizard and giant kangaroo rat increased significantly faster in grazed plots than the ungrazed controls, and abundances of 6 of 8 species were negatively correlated with increased residual dry matter. With relaxed alpha values to decrease Type II error, populations of blunt-nosed leopard lizards (500% greater), San Joaquin antelope squirrels (85% greater), and short-nosed kangaroo rats (73% greater) increased significantly on grazed plots over the course of the study compared to ungrazed plots. We did not find grazing to negatively affect abundance of any species we studied. When herbaceous cover is low during years of below average rainfall in deserts and other arid areas, grazing may not be necessary to maintain populations of small vertebrates. However, if cattle grazing is closely monitored in space and time to minimize adverse effects on the habitat, it could be an effective tool to control dense stands of non-native grasses and benefit native wildlife. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","Effects of grazing and invasive grasses on desert vertebrates in California",0

We conducted censuses to estimate the abundance and density of two sacred, village-dwelling populations (Lagwa and Akpugoeze) of Sclater's monkey (Cercopithecus sclateri), a threatened species endemic to southeastern Nigeria, and compared these data to previous census results. We recorded population increases in both sites: a 66% increase over 41/2 years in Lagwa (from 124 to 206 individuals) at an annual rate of 10.2%, and a 29% increase over 4 years in Akpugoeze (from 193 to 249 individuals) at an annual rate of 5.7%. Mean group size also increased in both sites. Density in Lagwa was 24.2individuals/km2, and density in a core survey area of Akpugoeze was 36-38individuals/km2. Our results may have been affected by monkey ranging and grouping patterns and improved detectability due to our revised census technique, which included secondary observers. With further work on methodology for censusing populations that occur in human-settled environments, techniques can be refined and customized to individual sites for more accurate estimates. Our investigation of Sclater's monkey in Lagwa and Akpugoeze, two sites critical for conservation of the species, indicated that both of these populations have increased, and neither faces immediate risk of extirpation.

Yet, to date, no quantitative study has sought to test possible solutions for preventing this form of human-wildlife conflict. 2.From February 2007 to August 2009, we monitored crop-raiding patterns across a Sumatran agroforest landscape to determine background levels of human-orangutan conflict. We also intensively monitored a subset of 50 farms to assess changes in farmer attitudes towards orangutan management; differences between farmer reported and independently enumerated monetary loss from crop raiding; and the effectiveness of mitigation techniques in reducing orangutan crop raiding on 35 treatment farms (25 trialling noise deterrents and 10 trialling tree nets) in comparison with 15 control farms over a pre-trial (12month) and a trial (18month) phase. Five months after the trials had ended, the ongoing use or uptake of the techniques were assessed. 3.Across the wider landscape, background levels of mean daily orangutan crop-raiding incidents per month (±SE) farms did not significantly differ between the pre-trial (9·1±3·7) and trial (7·1±4·3) phases, whilst on the 35 treatment farms it reduced significantly. Furthermore, crop yield increased (+60·8%) on the netted trial trees, but reduced (-27·4%) on the control farm trees. Despite this, there was no subsequent use of this technique, unlike those farmers (40%) who continued using the less-effective noise deterrents. 4.Farmer participation in the project yielded unexpected and positive attitude changes, from preferring orangutan removal (pre-trial) to in situ management with crop protection measures (post-trial). However, project participation may have increased farmer expectations of receiving compensation because the treatment farmers consistently overestimated their crop losses, unlike the control farmers who did not. 5.Synthesis and applications. Whilst human-orangutan conflicts caused substantial losses to local livelihoods, the identification of an effective mitigation method (nets) neither guaranteed its continued use nor uptake.

We observed 40 rehabilitating orangutans from the Orangutan Care and Quarantine Centre during 3 forest excursions each to determine whether their behavior fostered the development of survival skills. In total, 38% of their time was spent in locomotion, particularly quadrupedal arboreal travel (13%), walking (8%), climbing (7%), and vine-swinging (4%). 26.5% of their time was spent = 5 m from the ground, at heights up to 25 m. Arboreal activities were more common early in the excursions and interaction with caregivers more common later (h 1: 0.3% of time; h 5: 0.9% of time). Individuals of lower body mass were significantly more likely to engage in arboreal movement, locomotion in general, eating of bark and leaves, and social play, and less likely to eat insects. Those that had been at the Centre the longest were less likely to perform arboreal activities and significantly more likely to be found standing and at ground level than those that had been there for a shorter time. During this study, many forest food items were consumed, particularly leaves and fruit, but also invertebrates and bark. Little time was spent in sexual behavior, tool use, nest building, or socially mediated learning, but social play occupied almost 6% of their time. We conclude that regular excursions into the forest are likely to assist in the development of locomotion and feeding skills for survival in rehabilitating orangutans, but special attention is needed to encourage nest building, social activities, and arboreal activity.

From March 2006 to July 2010, we conducted line transect surveys and assessed group sizes and compositions in natural and nearby 60-70 year old mixed indigenous planted forest to determine the densities of diurnal primate species (Colobus guereza, Cercopithecus mitis, C. ascanius) in these two forest types at Isecheno, Kakamega Forest, Kenya. Line transect data were analyzed using the Encounter Rate, Whitesides, and Distance sampling methods, which all provided broadly consistent results. We found that all three diurnal primate species occupy both natural and planted forest at Isecheno. However, group densities of the two Cercopithecus species were 42-46% lower in planted than in natural forest. Colobus guereza achieved comparable group densities in the two forest types, although the species is found in smaller groups, and thus at lower (35%) individual density, in planted than in natural forest.

A troop of 16 monkeys was released into the Ntendeka Wilderness Area, a protected part of Ngome Forest, by the WATCH (Wild Animal Trauma Centre and Haven) rehabilitation centre in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Monitoring data were evaluated with regard to survival, mortality, suitability of the release site, breeding, condition, troop composition, behaviour, group dynamics, ranging patterns and the effectiveness of monitoring tools. The release was considered to be a partial success in that the troop exhibited behaviour, group dynamics and ranging patterns similar to wild conspecifics. However, the survival rate was low and the troop was judged to be non-self-sustaining. The main problems identified were the limited lifetimes of radio collars, which resulted in missing animals and caused monitoring to be cut short, illegal hunting activities, predation and a small troop size with few adults. The authors recommend improvements that may increase success, such as retaining troops in release enclosures for longer periods, releasing a larger troop with more adults that more closely matches wild troop composition, selecting a release site at least 3 km from the nearest human settlement and the use of GPS collars to allow for a longer monitoring period encompassing all seasonal conditions.

Such programs, which also typically in parallel help foster the protection of the release site, concern a wide range of endangered mammalian species, including our closest living relatives: chimpanzees. In June 2008, the Chimpanzee Conservation Center (CCC), which is located in the High Niger National Park (HNNP) in Guinea, released a group of 12 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) comprised of 6 females and 6 males (8-20 yr old). The selected release site lies 32 km from the sanctuary in the Mafou, a core area of HNNP where wild chimpanzees are also known to occur. The purpose of this release was therefore to reinforce the natural chimpanzee population within the Mafou core area and to promote the protection of the HNNP. Nearly 2 yr postrelease, 9 chimpanzees still remain free-living. Two thirds of the release chimpanzees were equipped with VHF-GPS store-on-board tracking collars. We used data from retrieved collars to explore the release chimpanzees' habitat use, individual day range, and core area use (50% and 80%) during the first year of the release. Males traveled significantly further than females. Although minimum day range did not differ between the sexes or vary seasonally, some release males were active for longer during the day than the females. Males also ranged over larger areas and used a wider network of core areas than the females. Habitat use was similar to that recorded in wild chimpanzees in the HNNP. As of September 2010, 2 males and 3 females form a group at the release site. Two of these females gave birth to healthy offspring respectively 16 and 20 mo postrelease. Another female successfully immigrated into a wild chimpanzee community.

The mean (±SD) distances between consecutive sleeping sites were recorded for 324 consecutive days and averaged 122 ± 108.0 m. Mean distances between sleeping sites for males and females were similar at 110.7 ± 92.6 m for males and 128.8 ± 116.7 m for females, with the greatest distance covered by a female (793 m).

In long-lived species, accurate estimations of demographic parameters are difficult to obtain, and therefore assessment of reintroduction success in such species is challenging. To assess the initial success of a reintroduction program for the long-lived, slow-reproducing, and critically endangered western lowland gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla, we analyzed postrelease monitoring data from 2 reintroduced populations, in the Batéké Plateau region of the Republics of Congo and Gabon, to quantify several demographic parameters, and compared our results with published data on wild gorilla populations. Annual survival rate of the 51 released gorillas was 97. 4%, 9 females gave birth to 11 infants at an annual birth rate of 0. 196 births per adult female, and first-year survival of the infants was 81. 8%. Annual birth rate within the reintroduced populations is not significantly different from that given for wild western gorilla populations, and other demographic parameters fall within the range of published data for wild gorilla populations. Our analysis illustrates that the reintroduction program has been successful in terms of the initial measures of postrelease survival and reproduction, and our quantitative data should facilitate the development of a population model that can predict the probability of population persistence and therefore provide an indication of longer-term reintroduction success. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Assessing initial reintroduction success in long-lived primates by quantifying survival, reproduction, and dispersal parameters: western lowland gorillas (<i>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</i>) in Congo and Gabon",0

Variation in glucocorticoid levels of the same species between protected and unprotect areas seldom has been measured, and the available evidence suggests that this relationship may depend on species-specific habitat requirements and biology. In the present study we focused on black howler monkeys ( Alouatta pigra), a canopy-dwelling primate species, as a case study to evaluate the physiological consequences of living in unprotected areas, and relate them with intragroup competition and competition with extragroup individuals. From February 2006 to September 2007 we collected 371 fecal samples from 21 adults belonging to five groups (two from protected and three from unprotected areas) in Campeche, Mexico. We recorded agonistic interactions within groups and encounters with other groups (1,200 h of behavioral observations), and determined fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations with radioimmunoassays. We used linear mixed models and Akaike's information criterion to choose the best model explaining variation in FGM concentrations between protected and unprotected areas calculated from five categorical variables: habitat type (protected vs. unprotected), participation in agonistic interactions, intergroup encounters, sex and female reproductive state, and season. The best model included habitat type, the interaction between habitat type and agonism, and the interaction between habitat type and season. FGM concentrations were higher in unprotected habitats, particularly when individuals were involved in agonistic interactions; seasonal variation in FGM concentrations was only detected in protected habitats. High FGM concentrations in black howler monkeys living in unprotected habitats are associated with increased within-group food competition and probably associated with exposure to anthropogenic stressors and overall food scarcity. Because persistent high GC levels can be detrimental to health and fitness, populations living in disturbed unprotected areas may not be viable in the long-term.","Primates living outside protect4ed habitats are more stressed: the case of black howler monkeys in the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula",0

The western lowland gorilla (WLG, Gorilla g. gorilla ) is persistently poached; infants are often illegally traded and used as pets. Some are confiscated and rehabilitated, then kept in sanctuaries or reintroduced into the wild. Prior to reintroduction, the ability of the orphans to survive independently in their environment needs to be assessed. Here, we performed a multivariate analysis, including diet composition, activity-budget, and pattern of strata using of a group of five juvenile WLG in the process of rehabilitation and distinguished three sub-periods of ecological significance: the high furgivory period, the Dialium fruits consumption period, and the high folivory period. The consequences of these variations on their well-being (play behaviour) and the group cohesion (spatial proximity and social interactions) were examined. Like wild WLGs, diets shifted seasonally from frugivorous to folivorous, while the same staple foods were consumed and large amounts of Dialium fruits were seasonally gathered high in trees. When succulent fruit intake was the highest, thus providing high energy from sugar, juveniles spent less time feeding, more time playing and group cohesion was the highest. Conversely, the cohesion decreased with increasing folivory, individuals spent more time feeding and less time playing together. Nonetheless, the group cohesion also decreased after the death of one highly social, wild-born orphan. This may underscore the importance of skilled individuals in the cohesion and well-being of the entire group and, ultimately, to rehabilitation success. This study evaluates the rehabilitation success with regards to the methods used and highlights the need to consider a set of individual and environmental factors for enhancing rehabilitation while preserving the local biodiversity and individual well-being.","Lemurs and tourism in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar: economic boom and other consequences",0

Nests already located on the beach, or that were laid prior to project commencement, were relocated at times varying between 10 days and 38 days post-deposition. This provided an opportunity to examine egg mortality in loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nests moved during this critical time period, and determine whether there was a correlation between the relocation and the timing of arrested egg development; we compared hatching and emergence success to nests relocated during the standard initial 12 hours post-deposition and those left in situ. Following hatchling emergence, we collected remaining unhatched eggs to determine development stage at the time of embryonic death. Mean hatch success was 53% for nests moved mid-incubation, versus 79-90% for nests left in situ or moved within 12 hours of deposition. For 6 of 10 nests, embryonic development ceased at the same visual developmental stage as the relocation. Although moving nests later than 12 hours decreases nest success and should be a matter of last resort, the forecasts for increased storm activity and sea level rise, and other impacts such as beach oiling, may necessitate nest relocation under less than ideal circumstances.

Females retain eggs in their oviducts and give birth to aquatic larvae or, in some populations, to fully metamorphosed juveniles. We investigated how variation in the birth size of larvae of five different sibships of S. salamandra affected larval survival, larval growth rates, time to metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis under different food and temperature conditions. Maternal effects, via the effect of larval birth size, attenuated throughout development in all environments but still affected metamorphic traits at lower temperatures. Larval developmental time was negatively correlated with larval birth size and positively correlated with size at metamorphosis. After controlling for the effect of larval birth size, broad-sense heritabilities were obtained for residual values of metamorphic traits, indicating that enough genetic variability exists at lower temperature environments and that responses to selection of metamorphic traits are possible. The size at and the time to metamorphosis were phenotypically and genetically correlated. Since both traits presumably affect fitness, genetic dependence between size and time to metamorphosis may act as a constraint on adaptive evolution through antagonistic pleiotropy. Mass-specific growth, time to metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis were plastic under different temperature and food conditions, but no significant sibship x environment interaction was found for any trait. In addition, significant cross-environment correlation for size at metamorphosis with respect to the food gradient indicates low potential for the adaptive evolution of reaction norms to heterogeneous food environments.","Captive management and breeding of the critically endangered southern corroboree frog (<i>Pseudophryne corroboree</i>) (Moore 1953) at Taronga and Melbourne Zoos.",0

These have led to national and international legislation and have generated debate about the most effective conservation actions. Under the EU Habitats Directive, all member states are obliged to establish a system for strict protection of species listed in Annex IV(a), which includes all bats. In England, this obligation has resulted in legislation that allows for derogation from strict protection under license, provided activities are undertaken to mitigate any potential negative effects on bat numbers. We used an evidence-based approach to assess the cost-effectiveness of mitigation strategies and the English bat-derogation licensing process as a whole. We analyzed data from 389 bat derogation licenses issued in England from 2003 to 2005 relating to 1776 roosts and 15 species to determine the nature and extent of development and mitigation activities and their effects on bats. Overall the effects of licensed activities on roosts were negative. Despite the level of protection afforded to bats, the majority (68%) of roosts for which derogation licenses were issued were destroyed. There were species-specific differences in the probability of roosts being destroyed, and impacts on roosts did not reflect a species' conservation status. Information provided by licensees was inadequate and inconsistent. Most licensees (67%) failed to submit postdevelopment reports, and postdevelopment monitoring was conducted at only 19% of sites. Despite a minimum of £4.13 million spent on mitigation structures for bats from 2003 to 2005, it was unclear whether the licensing process meets EU obligations. On the basis of our results, we believe there is a need to overhaul the licensing process, to establish a comprehensive, standardized postdevelopment monitoring system, and to demonstrate that mitigation is commensurate with Britain's legal obligations. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.","Mitigating the effect of development on bats in England with derogation licensing",0

Using radiotracking, we investigated the effects of exclusion on the soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus, a species that commonly roosts in buildings in Europe. Exclusions were performed under licence at five roosts in England in spring, when females were in the early stages of pregnancy. Following exclusion, all bats found alternative roosts and colonies congregated in nearby known roosts that had been used by radio-tagged bats prior to exclusion. We found no difference in roosting behaviour before and after exclusion. Both the frequency of roost switching and the type of roosts used by bats remained unchanged. We also found no change in foraging behaviour. Bats foraged in the same areas, travelled similar distances to reach foraging areas and showed similar patterns of habitat selection before and after exclusion. Population modelling suggested that any reduction in survival following exclusion could have a negative impact on population growth, whereas a reduction in productivity would have less effect. While the number of soprano pipistrelle exclusions currently licensed each year is likely to have little effect on local populations, the cumulative impacts of licensing the destruction of large numbers of roosts may be of concern.","Managing conflict between bats and humans: The response of soprano pipistrelles (<i>Pipistrellus pygmaeus</i>) to exclusion from roosts in houses",0

To date, no studies have examined the extent to which North American bats utilize urban green roofs.

We then identified bat vocalizations on these recordings to the species level. We documented the presence of five of nine possible bat species over both roof types: Lasiurus borealis, L. cinereus, L. noctivagans, P. subflavus,and. E. fuscus. Of the bat calls that could be identified to the species level, 66% were from L. borealis. Overall levels of bat activity were higher over green roofs than over conventional roofs.

Abundance of arachnids were higher in organic vineyards, although arachnid species richness was positively associated with the amount of ground vegetation cover. Organic farming was ineffective on its own to enhance bat activity and species richness regardless of the landscape context.

Fields managed under AES for cirl buntings (low-input spring barley or permanent pasture without inputs) were contrasted with control fields under conventional management (spring barley without management restrictions and winter cereals, or grazed without management restrictions) to identify such benefits for vascular plants, butterflies, bumblebees, carabid beetles, foliar invertebrates and bats. Activity-density and species richness of carabid beetles were both higher in AES spring barley fields than in control spring barley and winter cereal fields. Forb cover and abundance of butterflies and bumblebees were higher in AES spring barley fields than in winter cereals, but did not differ between AES and control spring barley.

Aims We investigated the use of young (411 years old) timber plantations by bats in comparison with other vegetation classes in a highly cleared and productive agricultural landscape in north-west New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods Initially, we recorded activity in paddocks before plantation establishment, and then four to six years after establishment. We compared activity within young eucalypt plantations with surrounding paddocks and remnant woodland. We also radio-tracked four different bat species to investigate how roosting and foraging was apportioned into different habitats. Key results The ultrasonic survey of bats found that the young plantations were typically used by 78 species and activity averaged 87 passes per night. Activity within plantations was similar to treeless paddocks, and approximately six times less than in small remnants. The very high activity levels and feeding buzzes in small remnants was significantly related to rich, basalt soil (which was used as a proxy for invertebrate biomass) on agricultural plains. Total activity and species richness was correlated positively with the number of remnant trees on the site, but neither plantation area nor shape influenced bat activity. Plantations were not used preferentially by radio-tracked bats at night compared with their availability in the local landscape (1314% bat use, 17% available). No bat roosts were located within the plantations. Most bat roosts were in tree hollows, which were absent in the plantations. Decorticating bark was abundant in eucalypt plantations, but only Nyctophilus geoffroyi was observed beneath bark and only in remnant trees outside of plantations. Conclusions Young eucalypt plantations have limited value for bats, and this is comparable to previous studies on more environmentally focussed plantings. Implications The value of plantations for bats would be improved by retaining remnant trees, both in the surrounding landscape and within plantations.

In contrast to our expectations, land-use intensification had no negative effect on species richness and abundance of all birds and bats. However, some habitat and feeding guilds, in particular forest specialist and frugivorous birds, were highly sensitive to land-use intensification. Although the habitat guilds of both, birds and bats, depended on a certain degree of vegetation structure, total bat and bird abundance was mediated primarily by the availability of the respective food resources. Even though the highly structured southern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro are able to maintain diverse bat and bird assemblages, the sensitivity of avian forest specialists against land-use intensification and the dependence of the bat and bird habitat guilds on a certain vegetation structure demonstrate that conservation plans should place special emphasis on these guilds.","Bats are not birds - different responses to human land-use on a tropical mountain",0

We randomly selected control and treatment turbines that were searched daily in summer and fall 2009 and 2010. Estimates of fatality, corrected for field biases, were compared between treatment and control turbines. In 2009, we estimated 21-51% fewer bats were killed per treatment turbine than per control turbine. In 2010, we determined an approximate 9% inherent difference between treatment and control turbines and when factored into our analysis, variation increased and between 2% more and 64% fewer bats were killed per treatment turbine relative to control turbines. We estimated twice as many hoary bats were killed per control turbine than treatment turbine, and nearly twice as many silver-haired bats in 2009. In 2010, although we estimated nearly twice as many hoary bats and nearly 4 times as many silver-haired bats killed per control turbine than at treatment turbines during the treatment period, these only represented an approximate 20% increase in fatality relative to the pre-treatment period for these species when accounting for inherent differences between turbine sets. Our findings suggest broadband ultrasound broadcasts may reduce bat fatalities by discouraging bats from approaching sound sources. However, effectiveness of ultrasonic deterrents is limited by distance and area ultrasound can be broadcast, in part due to rapid attenuation in humid conditions. We caution that an operational deterrent device is not yet available and further modifications and experimentation are needed. Future efforts must also evaluate cost-effectiveness of deterrents in relation to curtailment strategies to allow a cost-benefit analysis for mitigating bat fatalities.","Evaluating the effectiveness of an ultrasonic acoustic deterrent for reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines",1

Operational mitigation that limits operation may reduce fatalities but also limits energy production. We incorporated both temperature and wind speed into an operational mitigation design fine-tuned to conditions when bats are most active in order to improve economic efficiency of mitigation. We conducted a 2-year study at the Sheffield Wind Facility in Sheffield, Vermont. Activity of bats is highest when winds speeds are low (< 6.0 m/s) and, in our region, when temperatures are above 9.5°C. We tested for a reduction in bat mortality when cut-in speed at treatment turbines was raised from 4.0 to 6.0 m/s whenever nightly wind speeds were < 6.0 m/s and temperatures were > 9.5°C. Mortalities at fully operational turbines were 1.52-4.45 times higher than at treatment turbines. During late spring and early fall, when overnight temperatures generally fell below 9.5°C, incorporating temperature into the operational mitigation design decreased energy losses by 18%. Energy lost from implementation of our design was < 3% for the study season and approximately 1% for the entire year. We recommend that operational mitigation be implemented during high-risk periods to minimize bat fatalities and reduce the probability of long-term population-level effects on bats.","Reducing bat fatalities at wind facilities while improving the economic efficiency of operational mitigation",0

The impacts of roads on terrestrial fauna has been well studied, however little is known of the impact of roads on insectivorous bats. Wildlife crossing structures (e.g. fauna underpasses) may reduce the barrier impacts of roads and improve connectivity across roads. Use of underpasses by wildlife likely varies among species depending on their movement behaviour. In this study, we investigated whether the flight patterns of insectivorous bats influenced their use of underpasses. We monitored bat activity under and above 6 open-span bridges, 6 box culverts and 6 unmitigated sites along a major highway in Australia. We used Poisson regression models within a Bayesian framework of inference to compare the activity of 12 bat species (grouped into three guilds based on their flight patterns: clutter-adapted, edge-adapted, and open-adapted species) under the structures, over the road above the structures, above unmitigated segments of the highway, and in the vegetation adjacent to the roads. Bats were less active above the road than they were in the surrounding vegetation or under bridges. Two of the three guilds (i.e. seven species) crossed the highway more under bridges than they did under culverts or by going over the road, which suggests that bridges may reduce barrier effects of the road better than culverts. Installing bridges instead of culverts may better reduce the impacts of roads on multiple insectivorous bats species with a single structure type.","Differential use of highway underpasses by bats",1

Although vegetated fauna overpasses have not traditionally been considered as beneficial for microbats, these structures have recently been identified as a potential solution for assisting microbat communities. In Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, the Compton Road fauna overpass traverses a four-lane road, facilitating connectivity for mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians between two forest reserves. This study examined patterns of activity and species richness of microbat assemblages in relation to the Compton Road fauna overpass. Call recordings made over 7 months identified nine species and two species groups (groups of species unable to be differentiated), all of which were recorded using the overpass. Bat activity on the overpass was higher than in the adjoining forest, with higher detectability. Species richness and activity at the roadside where the overpass was present was also higher than the unvegetated roadside. Activity patterns based on feeding behaviors suggest that forest species such as Nyctophilus and Myotis spp. were using the overpass, alongside more generalist species. The vegetation on the overpass is likely to be the key factor encouraging microbat activity. The Compton Road overpass appears to lessen the impact of road presence and may facilitate permeability of a major road, suggesting potential for enhancing habitat connectivity and facilitating crossings. This study is the first indication that vegetated fauna overpasses can facilitate activity and provide natural habitat continuity for diverse Australian microbat communities.","Vegetated fauna overpass disguises road presence and facilitates permeability for forest microbats in Brisbane, Australia",0

Thinning of these forests is a widespread management practice that can affect forest species, including echolocating bats and their prey. We compared total activity of 11 bat taxa, foraging activity of six bat guilds and biomass of 11 insect orders across four forest thinning categories in managed remnant eucalypt forests in south-eastern Australia: unthinned regrowth, forest thinned recently (0–4 years) and in the medium term (5–10 years) and reference (mature open forest). Thinning had been carried out at large (˜350 ha) spatial scales. Total bat activity was 60% less and foraging activity was 80% less in unthinned regrowth, compared to reference sites, but activity levels were similar among thinned and reference sites. Insect biomass was greatest in unthinned sites, and while bat activity was related to prey biomass, this relationship was weak in unthinned sites. Together, this suggests that forest structure was more important than prey availability or time since thinning in influencing bat activity patterns. Synthesizing our findings with the broader literature on bats and thinning, we found support for a clutter threshold of 1100 stems ha-1, above which bat activity was markedly lower, across two continents (the USA and Australia) and four broad vegetation types (eucalypt, conifer, deciduous and mixed forests). While elsewhere bats with adaptive traits for open habitats generally respond positively to thinning, in our study, species with traits consistent with clutter tolerance (high call frequency and low wing aspect ratio) had lowest activity levels (up to 22 times) in unthinned regrowth compared to all other forest types. Synthesis and applications. Widespread dense regrowth forest can restrict movement and foraging of bats, even those adapted to clutter. We recommend thinning dense regrowth or plantations to below 1100 stems ha-1 when targeting bat foraging habitat, but effects of thinning on roost habitat and other forest biota require further investigation.","Bat communities respond positively to large-scale thinning of forest regrowth",0

In a recent pan-tropical assessment, Burivalova et al. [2] demonstrate the importance of logging intensity as a driver of biodiversity decline in timber estates. Their analyses reveal that species richness of some taxa could decline by 50% at harvest intensities of 38 m3 ha-1. However, they did not consider the extraction techniques that lead to these intensities. Here, we conduct a complementary meta-analysis of assemblage responses to differing logging practices: conventional logging and reduced-impact logging. We show that biodiversity impacts are markedly less severe in forests that utilise reduced-impact logging, compared to those using conventional methods. While supporting the initial findings of Burivalova et al. [2], we go on to demonstrate that best practice forestry techniques curtail the effects of timber extraction regardless of intensity. Therefore, harvest intensities are not always indicative of actual disturbance levels resulting from logging. Accordingly, forest managers and conservationists should advocate practices that offer reduced collateral damage through best practice extraction methods, such as those used in reduced-impact logging. Large-scale implementation of this approach would lead to improved conservation values in the 4 million km2 of tropical forests that are earmarked for timber extraction [3].","Improved timber harvest techniques maintain biodiversity in tropical forests",0

In forest, bats find many roosting and foraging opportunities. When foraging in forest, different bat species exploit a range of microhabitats according to their echolocation and flight style. When roosting, bats require sufficient numbers of suitable tree cavities. Overall, forest structure may influence both foraging and roosting behaviour, and in turn the number of bat species present and their population size. The exploitation of forests for commercial purposes may be a threat to biodiversity when logging leads to habitat loss, alteration or fragmentation. While some bat species may benefit from an increase in the amount of edge habitat determined by logging, others, more specialized to exploit forest interiors, may be potentially harmed. In this study we set out to assess the effect on foraging bats of different management approaches, comparing locally applied traditional approaches with innovative multifunctional management options and delayed logging. Within the framework of the LIFE+ ManFor C.BD. Project we surveyed the effects of thinning at four Italian forest sites, each representing a separate case study. We found that in logged plots bat activity either showed no difference from unlogged plots or resulted in an increase in foraging activity, suggesting that thinning, at least in the forest types we dealt with, has no adverse consequences on bat foraging. However, in our case the effects varied greatly across sites and were detected mostly when all bat species were pooled together for analysis. We conclude that forest exploitation may be sustainable and even favour foraging bats, but since our work neither covered direct mortality linked with forestry operations nor roost loss, further studies are needed to analyze these important aspects. We also highlight that total bat activity revealed by acoustic surveys carried out with automatic recorders may be used as an appropriate indicator of forestry effects on bats.","The effect of thinning on bat activity in Italian high forests: the LIFE+ ""ManFor C.BD."" experience",0

We estimated population growth rates at 20 hibernacula pre- and post-gating and quantified the change in population growth rates after gate installation. Hibernacula with increasing growth rates prior to gate placement all experienced decreased growth rates after installation. For hibernacula with declining growth rates prior to construction, growth rates increased moderately after installation. When weighted by population size, average change in growth rates across all 20 hibernacula was negative.

Prescribed fires are often used in the management of vegetation for ecological values, wildlife habitat and reduction of risk of wildfire. However, debate continues over whether active fire management is beneficial to flora and fauna. Although bats comprise ~20% of the world's extant mammal fauna, they have been largely ignored in studies investigating ecosystem response to fire, especially in Australia. Aims In the present study, we aim to investigate the immediate responses of microbats to prescribed fires in a tropical eucalypt woodland.Methods We used a replicated paired experimental design, consisting of burned and unburned treatment and control sites, to investigate how bat activity and community structure change following a prescribed fire. Key results Total bat activity increased significantly following fire. Fire also resulted in changes in the bat species assemblage. Changes in community structure were driven by the following five species: Saccolaimus spp., Chalinolobus nigrogriseus, Chaerephon jobensis, Rhinolophus megaphyllus and unidentified Species c35. Activity of C. nigrogriseus, Saccolaimus spp., C. jobensis and Species c35 increased in the burned sites, whereas changes in the activity of R. megaphyllus were uncorrelated with the effects of fire. Conclusions The effect of fire on these species is consistent with flight patterns and habitat use; species with higher wing aspect ratios, such as Saccolaimus spp., which are capable of fast flight but with limited manoeuvrability, became more active in the open conditions created by fire. Implications The results of the present study suggest that prescribed fire as an environmental management tool may be beneficial to bats, at least in the short term, because it increases habitat suitability for a wider range of species. © CSIRO 2013.","Prescribed fire in eucalypt woodlands: immediate effects on a microbat community of northern Australia",0

We selected study sites that were actively managed for savanna and woodland conditions and control areas on similar landforms that had succeeded to closed-canopy forest. We used Anabat detectors to survey bats during the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012. We fit single-species site-occupancy models to estimate detection probability and site occupancy. We evaluated a priori hypotheses in an information theoretic approach by evaluating support for candidate models that included habitat, landscape, and management effects. Site occupancy of evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) was negatively related to poletimber and sawtimber density and positively related to fire frequency, while northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) site occupancy was positively related to poletimber density and negatively related to understory stem densities. Site occupancy of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis), and tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) were mostly not related to local vegetation structure and site occupancy was high across the savanna, woodland, forest gradient.

This work was carried out in five small streams located in the NE of Portugal using bioacoustic surveys during the summer of 2011. The present study confirms that, in the northeast areas of Portugal, the majority of bat species use artificial bodies of water for either drinking or foraging, but species differed in terms of their activity levels over the reservoirs when compared with intact stream habitats. As predicted, small dams in the study area were important centers of overall bat activity relative to other sampling areas. At the same time, feeding activity was also higher in the flooded areas. We also found that Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Myotis daubentonii, Pipistrellus kuhlii, Pipistrellus pygmaeus/Miniopterus schreibersii, Tadarida teniotis and Nyctalus leisleri/Eptesicus serotinus benefited from the presence of dam reservoirs. Hypsugo savii activity was also mostly recorded at reservoir points. However, the highest number of endangered and rare species was recorded at an intact stream habitat. This result emphasizes the relevance of riparian habitats for bats, especially for the most endangered species. The relationship between dam availability, riparian quality and bat diversity suggested that the changes in the streams promoted by damming could affect both bat species richness and activity levels, leading to changes in the overall composition of the bat community. In conclusion, this study found that small reservoirs have a significant influence on bat activity. However, dams appear to primarily benefit the most common species, while the endangered species were associated with riparian habitats. Therefore, for conservation proposes of the local bat community, riparian areas appear to be more important than reservoirs.

However, little is known about the impacts of these invasive predators on bats (Chiroptera), one of the most specious mammal groups, and one of the most widespread groups of mammals threatened on oceanic islands (> 200 spp.). Nearly 50% of the world's threatened bats are island endemics and because they are often the only native mammals on islands, they fulfil important ecological roles such as pollination and seed dispersal. Long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) are critically endangered because of predation by exotic mammals, particularly ship rats (Rattus rattus), introduced by humans to the island archipelago of New Zealand. We monitored the survival of bats in three colonies in temperate rainforest in Fiordland over 22 years. Since 2009, we controlled predators during irruption phases and compared survival of bats in previously untreated areas with survival in forest blocks treated using rodenticides deployed in bait stations. Survival was estimated using multi-state mark-recapture models in Program Mark 7.0 with > 15,000 bats tagged. Survival was primarily dependent on year and age of bats, although seedfall intensity of the dominant canopy tree and predator management was also influential. Survival in long-tailed bats was as high as, or higher, than figures for bats generally in years with low predator numbers or predator control. Survival was markedly higher in treatment years when predators were managed (0.82 compared to 0.55). Population modelling indicated managed colonies will increase (<U+03BB> > 1.05) whereas unmanaged colonies will decline (<U+03BB> = 0.89 - 0.98) under scenarios that reflect increased frequency of beech mast and predator irruptions. Thus, effective predator control is essential for recovering long-tailed bat populations. Warming temperatures indicate that predator irruptions are becoming more frequent, which would require more predator control in the future than at present if declines in bat populations are to be reversed. These results are relevant to the conservation of threatened bats on oceanic islands, given the abundance of exotic mammalian predators, particularly ship rats, on them.","Controlling invasive predators enhances the long-term survival of endangered New Zealand long-tailed bats (<i>Chalinolobus tuberculatus</i>): Implications for conservation of bats on oceanic islands",0

The behavioral and physiological changes associated with hibernation leave bats vulnerable to WNS, but the persistence of bats within the contaminated regions of North America suggests that survival might vary predictably among individuals or in relation to environmental conditions. To investigate variables influencing WNS mortality, we conducted a captive study of 147 little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) inoculated with 0, 500, 5 000, 50 000, or 500 000 Pd conidia and hibernated for five months at either 4 or 10uC.

Although all bats inoculated with Pd exhibited shorter torpor bouts compared to controls, a characteristic of WNS, only bats inoculated with 500 conidia had significantly lower survival odds compared to controls. These data show that host and environmental characteristics are significant predictors of WNS mortality, and that exposure to up to 500 conidia is sufficient to cause a fatal infection.

However, knowledge of the effects of olive farming on animal species still remains elusive and conservation and management guidelines for the relevant stakeholders are therefore urgently needed. Here, we investigate community composition and activity patterns of insectivorous bats in Mediterranean olive monocultures in Southern Portugal. Bats surveys were carried out in three types of olive farms representing increasing levels of management intensity: (1) traditional olive farms, managed with few or no chemical inputs or manual labor (2) semi-intensive olive farms, which share certain characteristics with traditional plantations, but are more intensively managed; (3) intensive olive farms, which are managed with high and frequent chemical inputs, and highly mechanized systems. We found differences in species richness and activity levels between farming practices. Both the number of species and foraging activity declined with increasing management intensity. However, olive groves as a whole showed a lower number of species compared with the regional species pool and extremely low activity levels, suggesting that large and homogeneous olive monocultures may serve more as commuting areas than true foraging habitats for bats. To our knowledge, this is the first study explicitly demonstrating the pervasive impact of olive farming on the community composition and activity levels of insectivorous bats. In the face of an even-increasing proportion of land surface devoted to olive farming in Mediterranean landscapes, our findings are therefore of great concern.

In contrast, part-night lighting did not influence the activity of early emerging bat species around streetlights, except for Pipistrellus pipistrellus for which there was significantly less activity on part-night lighting sites than on full-night lighting sites. Overall, no significant difference in activity between part- and full-night lighting sites were observed in 5 of the 8 species studied, suggesting that current part-night lighting schemes fail to encompass the range of activity of most bat species. We recommend that such schemes start earlier at night to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of artificial lighting on light-sensitive species, particularly along ecological corridors that are especially important to the persistence of biodiversity in urban landscapes.","Is part-night lighting an effective measure to limit the impacts of artificial lighting on bats",0

Effects are reported for many species groups, and include changes in presence, behaviour, physiology and life-history traits. Among these, bats are strongly affected, and how bat species react to light is likely to vary with light colour. Different spectra may therefore be applied to reduce negative impacts. We used a unique set-up of eight field sites to study the response of bats to three different experimental light spectra in an otherwise dark and undisturbed natural habitat. We measured activity of three bat species groups around transects with light posts emitting white, green and red light with an intensity commonly used to illuminate countryside roads. The results reveal a strong and spectrum-dependent response for the slowflying Myotis and Plecotus and more agile Pipistrellus species, but not for Nyctalus and Eptesicus species. Plecotus and Myotis species avoided white and green light, but were equally abundant in red light and darkness. The agile, opportunistically feeding Pipistrellus species were significantly more abundant around white and green light, most likely because of accumulation of insects, but equally abundant in red illuminated transects compared to dark control. Forest-dwelling Myotis and Plecotus species and more synanthropic Pipistrellus species are thus least disturbed by red light. Hence, in order to limit the negative impact of light at night on bats, white and green light should be avoided in or close to natural habitat, but red lights may be used if illumination is needed.","Response of bats to light with different spectra: light-shy and agile bat presence is affected by white and green, but not red light",0

The Natura 2000 network (N2000) of protected areas is the main pillar of European action to halt biodiversity loss. Within N2000, special areas of conservation (SACs) are designated to protect habitats and species of the highest conservation interest, i.e. habitats from Annex I and species (other than birds) listed in Annex II of the Habitat Directive. Thus, a critical and urgent task is to assess the effectiveness of N2000 in the protection of these species. Here, we used distribution data for Spanish bats to test whether the species included in Annex II are better represented in N2000 than the remaining bats found in Spain, since SAC sites were specifically designated to protect the former species. In general, we found significantly high overlapping values between species distribution and N2000 sites (both groups of species are in general over-represented in N2000). However, contrary to our expectations, N2000 (even when only SACs were considered) did not offer higher representation values for the species listed in Annex II than for other species. We found that N2000 performed well even for non-target species, and that species from Annex II could have acted as effective umbrella species for the remaining bat species. Finally, the usefulness of including a species in Annex II is discussed, and guidelines to improve the efficiency of the N2000 for bat conservation are offered.","Are species listed in the Annex II of the Habitats Directive better represented in Natura 2000 network than the remaining species?

Forest-dwelling bats are highly reliant on forest structures, such as snags and hollow trees, which the bats need as roosts. The decrease in such forest microhabitats significantly affects the habitat use and, therefore, the activity in forests. To determine whether N2000 beech forests under active timber production offer better habitats for bats compared to commercially used non-N2000 forests, we measured the bat activity and assessed the potential roosts in trees and snags in eleven pairs of stands. All survey stands represented mesotrophic beech forests (. Fagus sylvatica L.) of the N2000 habitat type 9130 (. Asperulo-Fagetum) in three European Biogeographic Regions. The activity of all bat species, the activity of priority N2000 species, the species number, the number of trees with roosts and the snag volume did not differ significantly between the N2000 and non-N2000 stands. We conclude that the current management of the N2000 beech forests is almost identical to that of non-N2000 commercial forests, and thus, the N2000 status has not led to an increase of bat-relevant habitat variables yet. Consequently, additional efforts beyond the administrative assignment of N2000 areas are required to build and ensure an ecologically effective and sustainable network of beech forests in Europe, including increasing important forest requirements for bats, such as roosts and snags.","Poor effectiveness of Natura 2000 beech forests in protecting forest-dwelling bats",0

Inside churches, bat droppings and urine can cause damage to the historic fabric of the building and to items of cultural significance. In extreme cases, large quantities of droppings can restrict the use of a church for worship and/or other community functions. In the United Kingdom, bats and their roosts are protected by law, and striking a balance between conserving the natural and cultural heritage can be a significant challenge. We investigated mitigation strategies that could be employed in churches and other historic buildings to alleviate problems caused by bats without adversely affecting their welfare or conservation status. We used a combination of artificial roost provision and deterrence at churches in Norfolk, England, where significant maternity colonies of Natterer's bats Myotis nattereri damage church features. Radio-tracking data and population modelling showed that excluding M. nattereri from churches is likely to have a negative impact on their welfare and conservation status, but that judicious use of deterrents, especially high intensity ultrasound, can mitigate problems caused by bats. We show that deterrence can be used to move bats humanely from specific roosting sites within a church and limit the spread of droppings and urine so that problems to congregations and damage to cultural heritage can be much reduced. In addition, construction of bespoke roost spaces within churches can allow bats to continue to roost within the fabric of the building without flying in the church interior. We highlight that deterrence has the potential to cause serious harm toM. nattereri populations if not used judiciously, and so the effects of deterrents will need careful monitoring, and their use needs strict regulation.","Mitigating the impact of bats in historic churches: the response of Nattererâ€™s bats <i>Myotis nattereri</i> to artificial roosts and deterrence",0

Currently, only nest boxes are commonly used to mitigate or offset lost cavity-bearing trees, with a number of shortfalls reported using this technique. There is a need to trial alternative techniques to improve artificial cavity provisions. This preliminary study investigated the use of carving hollows directly into tree trunks using chainsaws. Sixteen hollows of two simple cavity types were created in a timber production forest in south-eastern Australia. One cavity type comprised a basal entrance (38 mm in diameter) which provided a space above the entrance, intended for bats, and the other cavity type provided a space below a 38 mm or 76 mm entrance, intended for marsupials and birds. Five species used the hollows over a 15-month cavity monitoring period; feathertail glider (Acrobates pygmaeus) (in 75% of the hollows), brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii) (75%), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) (63%), long-eared bat (Nyctophilus sp.) (50%) and white-throated treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaea) (25%). Camera monitoring revealed hollow inspection after only one day post hollow creation by white-throated treecreepers and feathertail gliders, and nest building by white-throated treecreepers after three days. No hollow host tree failure occurred for either of the two hollow wall widths trialled over two years of monitoring tree stability. Wound-wood formed and partly enclosed the hollows’ faceplates over time, improving the sturdiness of the hollow and likely resulted in hollows closely resembling natural cavities. Mechanically created tree hollows have a broad application potential across many landscapes with the prospect to overcome some of the reported drawbacks of nest boxes.

We surveyed bat activity, vegetation structure, and landscape characteristics at 64 sites over two years in restored northern jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests of south-western Australia. Filters to use of restored forest were present for all bats, other than the open space group. We detected dynamic filters to use of restored forest by the open space edge group and unidirectional filters for the closed space edge and closed space groups. Filters to bat use of restored forests were species-specific and related to habitat, rather than landscape, features. In landscapes with relatively low patch-matrix contrast, such as the northern jarrah forest, management actions to reduce filters should focus on habitat features. To manage for the persistence of specific species within restored forest patches, tree density and midstory cover should aim to be at, or close to, reference forest levels.","Habitat features act as unidirectional and dynamic filters to bat use of production landscapes",0

We combined acoustic monitoring of bat activity and species richness in artificial and natural bodies of water in the Negev desert, Israel and measured 27 variables of water chemistry and quality at each site. Significant differences in water chemistry and quality were found between natural and artificial bodies of water. Species richness and activity of bats did not differ between artificial and natural bodies of water, indicating that desert-dwelling bats may benefit from artificial bodies of water, however activity within species differed between natural and artificial bodies of water. Some species of bats were only recorded at natural bodies of water, suggesting that these species are not tolerant to lower quality of water and emphasizes the importance of natural bodies of water in desert ecosystems.

Habitat modification resulting from agriculture can, however, have both positive and negative consequences for animal species. The ecological trade-offs involved in agricultural development have often not been explored sufficiently well to identify mutually beneficial solutions. Bats, for example, have been strongly impacted by agriculture intensification, mainly through the destruction of forests and natural wetlands. However, artificial wetlands created primarily for irrigation in agricultural landscapes may provide foraging habitats for bats and thus contribute to both the conservation of bat species and the regulation of insect pest species. We studied the influence of artificial wetlands on bat communities in agricultural landscapes in South Africa. We used mixed models to assess spatial variations in species richness, total bat activity, and species activity across 30 landscapes. Each study site was centred on a 'focal wetland' and surrounded by various habitat categories: open habitat, vineyards, orchards and trees. Our results show a crucial role of wetlands for all bat species as well as a significant influence of wetland size and water cover on bat activity. However, we observed no significant difference in species richness and only small differences in activity levels between the 'focal wetland' and the surrounding habitats. The present study contributes to the body of literature suggesting that farm dams may act as biodiversity hotspots when properly managed.

Using acoustic data we tested the hypothesis that water availability restricts bat activity in the dry season to ponds, whereas in the rainy season resources are widely available and therefore used throughout the area. We compared bat activity at six ponds with that of a 500-meter transect perpendicular to each pond. We predicted that activity would be higher at ponds in the dry season, whereas in the rainy season activity should be equal or higher at transects. Also, all species guilds would use ponds in the dry season, whereas gleaners, edge aerial and open aerial foragers would be more frequent at transects in the rainy season. In no instance activity was higher at transects than at ponds during the rainy season. Open areas showed little or no bat activity in the dry season, but were very active in the rainy season. One transect located in dense forest and one near human dwellings were active both seasons. Open aerial foragers were present mostly on ponds in the dry season, and on ponds and transects in the rainy season; edge aerial bats were common in ponds in the dry season, but rare in transects in the rainy season. Trawling bats used ponds and transects in both seasons; and gleaners were rare over ponds and transects in both seasons. Because bats use the local habitat differently depending on season and feeding guild, and climate and seasonality vary greatly in Mexican temperate forests, conservation strategies can not be generalized, but should be implemented on a case-by-case basis.","Activity of insectivorous bats is related to water availability in a highly modified Mexican temperate forest",0

In the best case scenario, roosts would attract seed-carrying bats (Family Phyllostomidae) into degraded pastures and form nucleating patches of native vegetation. We tested this scenario by monitoring 48 artificial roosts in pastures and adjacent forest fragments in southern Costa Rica over 2. years. Half of the pasture roosts were exposed to direct sunlight and half were affixed to 4-m living stakes of Erythrina poeppigiana (Walp.) O.F. Cook that provided shade. After 2. years, 94% of roosts in forest and 40% of roosts in pasture had been used by bats at least once - primarily for nocturnal feeding. Maximum daily temperature inside of roosts was the best microclimatic predictor of bat visitation. We identified at least five species of bats that visited roosts, including two frugivores (Carollia and Glossophaga spp.). Bat-mediated seed dispersal increased with the number of frugivorous bat detections at roosts, but seedling recruitment did not increase with either bat detections or seed abundance over a 2-year period. Given that bats rarely used roosts in pastures, and bat visitation did not increase seedling recruitment, our data suggest that artificial bat roosts did not accelerate forest regeneration in abandoned, premontane pastures in southern Costa Rica. This method could be refined by investigating alternative roost designs, barriers to seedling recruitment below roosts, improvement of roost microclimatic conditions in pastures, and ability of bats to detect roosts in different habitats. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Artificial bat roosts did not accelerate forest regeneration in abandoned pastures in southern Costa Rica",0

The soprano pipistrelles' common roost sites were in hollow trees (n = 14), but they also used crevices in rock walls (n = 2) and the attic of one building.

Man-made structures, such as buildings and bat boxes, provided the warmest cavities, whereas natural cavities did not differ significantly from air temperatures. The bats did not find thermo neutral roosts most of the time, and this should affect the energy budgets, and thus the bats' behaviour.

The 109 publications reviewed originated from four regions. The majority were from Europe (70%) followed by North America (16%), Australia (12%) and Asia (3%). Publications reported box use for research (n = 67), conservation management (n = 42) and public bat awareness (n = 1). The most commonly used bat box designs could be divided into five basic types, four originating from Europe and one from North America. Woodcement as a box material was frequently used in Europe and was practically absent elsewhere with timber boxes most commonly used overall. Seventy-one species of bats have been recorded using boxes, although only 18 were identified as using boxes commonly and 31 species were reported to have formed maternity roosts. The lack of maternity and overwintering roost records in boxes is a concern. There is a need to test current box types across geographical regions and to develop designs further. Where boxes are used as a conservation tool, consideration should be given to the long-term maintenance costs of a box program. Unless known to be unsuitable to target species, boxes should be made from durable materials, be unattractive to non-target species and be 'self-cleaning'. Deploying a variety of box designs in clusters, time since box installation, non-target species box competition and target species-specific box design elements are likely influencing box uptake. The provision of boxes that comprise different microclimates and box aspects are likely best suited to meet the varying needs of a given tree roosting echolocating bat community. No conclusive evidence was found that box installation height is important for box uptake. There is concern that boxes may provide a competitive advantage for bat species commonly using boxes.

Forest bat populations are known to provide important ecosystem services such as pest control and bat boxes have become one of the most popular management options for counteracting the loss of roosts. However, bat boxes tend to be employed in non-native forests near highly humanized areas where human disturbance is higher. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the surrounding landscape composition affects bat box occupancy in urban non-native forests along the Mediterranean corridor in the Northeastern Iberian Peninsula. Two hundred wooden bat boxes were monitored in young non-native forests in the period 2004–2012. The influence of land cover on occupancy rate of bat boxes was analysed at the landscape level in a 5 km buffer around bat-box stations. In total, 1659 inspections were carried out, in which a 15 % occupancy rate was detected. Bat boxes hosted three different species (Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri). More than 70 % of the occupancy can be explained by habitat and spatial composition. The presence of urban areas around bat boxes tends to have a negative impact on bat occupation rates; by contrast, forest coverage has a positive effect, especially for the tree-dwelling bats. These patterns could be associated with the large number of available roosts in buildings, microhabitat or phylopatry. Thus, to increase success, we suggest that landscape composition should be considered when using bat boxes for conservation.","Bat boxes in urban non-native forests: a popular practice that should be reconsidered",0

Here we compared the engineering and catching implications of subtle, progressive rigging changes to a W trawl paired against a standard Florida flyer trawl; both rigged with another eco-efficient modification, termed the 'batwing' otter board (suitably sized for each trawl). The W-trawl refinements included: (i) securing netting at the wing ends to prevent sliding; (ii) moving the headline forward and footrope aft; and (iii) inserting dan lenos at the wing ends. The first two modifications resulted in a maximum drag reduction by the W trawl of up to 11% for a 1.14 × increase in spread. Catches ha-1 of mostly retained (commercially important) large brachyurans and cephalopods were maintained, but penaeid catches were reduced in the W trawl (by at least 33%), which was mostly attributed to less than optimal ground-gear contact. This study provides a base for future research to concurrently reduce the energy intensity and habitat impacts of penaeid trawls, via holistic modifications.","Progressively evaluating a penaeid W trawl to improve eco-efficiency",0

Usingcommercial logbook data,we estimate that the use of modified nets could reduce discards by~240 tons per year. This outcomewas achieved with moderate declines in the catch rate (kg h21) of the target species, Western King Prawn (mean ~15%), of which almost allwere small adults of lowcommercial value. Adoption of the modified net by industrywas realized in March 2012, because it met environmental objectives (i.e. reducing bycatch and improving public perceptions of sustainability), reduced prawn damage, demonstrated commensurate financial returns, and engaged stakeholders throughout the development process.Overall, the project provides a useful example of bycatch research with demonstrable outcomes of improving the ecological and economic sustainability of prawn harvests.","Reducing discards in a temperate prawn trawl fishery: a collaborative approach to bycatch research in South Australia",0

A series of descriptive field studies were performed to assess fish and benthic communities between two areas within a newly established MPA in SW Portugal. We characterized benthic macroalgal composition and determined the size, density and biomass of the main benthic predatory and herbivorous fish species as well as the main benthic herbivorous invertebrates to assess indications of top-down control on the phytobenthic assemblages. Fish species were identical inside and outside the MPA, in both cases Sarpa salpa was the most abundant fish herbivore and Diplodus spp. accounted for the great majority of the benthic predators. However, size and biomass of D. spp. were higher inside than outside the MPA. The main herbivorous invertebrate was the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, which was smaller and predominantly showing a crevice-dwelling behaviour in the MPA. In addition, P. lividus size frequency distribution showed a unimodal pattern outside and a bimodal pattern inside the MPA. We found significant differences in the algal assemblages between inside and outside the MPA, with higher abundance of turf and foliose algae inside, and articulated calcareous and corticated macrophytes outside the MPA, but no differences in the invasive Asparagopsis spp. The obtained results show differences in predatory fish and benthic community structure, but not in species richness, inside and outside the MPA. We hypothesize these differences lead to variation in species interactions: directly through predation and indirectly via affecting sea urchins behavioural patterns, predators might drive changes in macroalgal assemblages via trophic cascade in the study area. However due to non-biological differences between the two areas it is difficult to suggest that the MPA causes increased biological parameters of targeted species and to assess predatory control and trophic cascade effects in areas where fishing pressure is reduced. It is therefor advisable to design MPAs so that their impacts can be scientifically evaluated in a proper fashion.","Limited differences in fish and benthic communities and possible cascading effects inside and outside a protected marine area in Sagres (SW Portugal)",0

Furthermore, out of the few studies published on MPAs in temperate waters, the majority focus on specific ecological or fishery components rather than investigating the ecosystem as a whole. This study therefore investigated the dynamics of both benthic communities and fish populations within a recently established, fully protected marine reserve in Lamlash Bay, Isle of Arran, United Kingdom, over a four year period. A combination of photo and diver surveys revealed live maerl (Phymatolithon calcareum), macroalgae, sponges, hydroids, feather stars and eyelash worms (Myxicola infundibulum) to be significantly more abundant within the marine reserve than on surrounding fishing grounds. Likewise, the overall composition of epifaunal communities in and outside the reserve was significantly different. Both results are consistent with the hypothesis that protecting areas from fishing can encourage seafloor habitats to recover. In addition, the greater abundance of complex habitats within the reserve appeared to providing nursery habitat for juvenile cod (Gadus morhua) and scallops (Pecten maximus and Aequipecten opercularis). In contrast, there was little difference in the abundance of mobile benthic fauna, such as crabs and starfish, between the reserve and outside. Similarly, the use of baited underwater video cameras revealed no difference in the abundance and size of fish between the reserve and outside. Limited recovery of these ecosystem components may be due to the relatively small size (2.67 km2) and young age of the reserve (<5 years), both of which might have limited the extent of any benefits afforded to mobile fauna and fish communities. Overall, this study provides evidence that fully protected marine reserves can encourage seafloor habitats to recover, which in turn, can create a number of benefits that flow back to other species, including those of commercial importance.","Sessile and mobile components of a benthic ecosystem display mixed trends within a temperate marine reserve",0

Pots (also known as creels or traps) are used as a less impactful alternative to trawling in a number of crustacean fisheries, although bycatch may still occur. Pots have been suggested as an alternative fishing method that would reduce the high levels of fish bycatch in the New Zealand scampi (Metanephrops challengeri) trawl fishery. This hypothesis was assessed by comparing the bycatch rates from four different designs of pots used in similar deep sea lobster fisheries overseas. The effects of bait and location on bycatch were also assessed by using three different bait types and fishing the pots at two different scampi commercial fishing sites around 200 km apart. The different pot designs were observed to significantly affect the bycatch of hagfish (Eptatretus cirrhatus) and total bycatch at both sites, while at the Chatham Rise site the bycatch of fish species and invertebrate was also affected by pot design. The pot design with the highest levels of bycatch at both sites was Pot 2, a two-chambered parlour pot which caught between 1.5–10.1 times more total bycatch than the other pot designs. Additionally, both hagfish and total bycatch showed significant spatial variation at two scales; among individual deployments of strings of pots within locations, and among locations within the sites. The bycatch from the pots included proportionately more invertebrates and hagfish, and less other fish species when compared to previous studies analysing the bycatch of the trawl fishery for New Zealand scampi. The results indicate that the development of potting methods for New Zealand scampi has the potential to reduce bycatch of some fish species, but will need to focus on reducing hagfish and invertebrate bycatch through improved pot design and spatially-targeted fishing.","Factors affecting bycatch in a developing New Zealand scampi potting fishery",0

The reserve effect includes but is beyond the goal of protecting particular species or areas with economical or cultural value. However, most data on the effects of MPAs focus on target species and there is limited evidence for the consequences of protection at larger levels of organization. Quantitative information on the reserve effect remains elusive partly because of its complex nature. Data on biodiversity can be used to quantify the reserve effect if not restricted to specific taxonomic groups. In our study, we quantified species diversity, trophic diversity, and an approach to functional diversity in five MPAs and adjacent non-protected areas along the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Our three measures of diversity were based on the abundance of algae, fish, sessile and mobile invertebrates in shallow water rocky communities and could be used to estimate the reserve effect based on species, trophic levels, or functional roles. We tested the hypothesis that species, trophic, and functional diversity were higher in protected areas than in adjacent non-protected areas. Species diversity varied with geographic area but not with protection status. However, we found higher functional diversity inside MPAs. Also, the effect of protection on functional diversity varied as a function of the geographic area. Our results support the uniqueness of MPAs at a species level and the universality of the reserve effect at the level of the trophic groups' composition.

Several studies reported positive effects of organic compared to conventional farming on bat populations and on nocturnal insect prey abundance. We registered the flight and feeding activity of 12 bat species in rice paddies in Northwestern Italy to test the effect of wetland farm management and agricultural intensification on bats habitat use. Our study evaluated the different ecological roles of organic vs conventional rice farms and natural wetlands in conservation of bat species. For the 12 species under study, flying activity was recorded in all three land management types. Only the genus Pipistrellus hunted in conventional and organic farms. Myotis sp, Eptesicus serotinus and Hypsugo savii were recorded hunting only in natural wetlands. Rinolophus ferrumequinum was detected only in natural wetlands. Bats fed in organic farms as well as in natural wetlands, whereas they were unlikely to forage in conventional farms. Conventional rice paddies do not provide ideal foraging sites for bats, likely due to the widespread use of pesticides, water management, and intensive weed control on embankments. Organic rice paddies, due to the less aggressive management, appear to have a higher habitat quality compared to conventional ones, and are therefore more suitable for feeding activities, possibly due to the greater availability of prey. Furthermore, while the limited ecological value of conventional farms for bat conservation is confirmed in this research for rice paddies, further effort should be made to preserve natural wetlands. We argued that farmland practices that maximise organic farming and ensure the conservation of natural wetlands, in accordance with the recent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, are essential for bat conservation in agricultural environments and, more generally, to preserve biodiversity.","Bat activity in rice paddies: organic and conventional farms compared to unmanaged habitat",0

Very few studies compared the effects of agricultural practices on such taxa, and overall, only as a comparison of conventional versus organic farming without accurately accounting for underlying practices, especially in conventional where many alternatives exist. Divergent results founded in these previous studies could be driven by this lack of clarification about some unconsidered practices inside both conventional and organic systems. We simultaneously compared, over whole nights, bat activity on contiguous wheat fields of one organic and three conventional farming systems located in an intensive agricultural landscape. The studied organic fields (OT) used tillage (i.e., inversion of soil) without chemical inputs. In studied conventional fields, differences consisted of the following: tillage using few herbicides (T), conservation tillage (i.e., no inversion of soil) using few herbicides (CT), and conservation tillage using more herbicide (CTH), to control weeds. Using 64 recording sites (OT = 12; T = 21; CT = 13; CTH = 18), we sampled several sites per system placed inside the fields each night. We showed that bat activity was always higher in OT than in T systems for two (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus pipistrellus) of three species and for one (Pipistrellus spp.) of two genera, as well as greater species richness. The same results were found for the CT versus T system comparison. CTH system showed higher activity than T for only one genus (Pipistrellus spp.). We did not detect any differences between OT and CT systems, and CT showed higher activity than CTH system for only one species (Pipistrellus kuhlii). Activity in OT of Pipistrellus spp. was overall 3.6 and 9.3 times higher than CTH and T systems, respectively, and 6.9 times higher in CT than T systems. Our results highlight an important benefit of organic farming and contrasted effects in conventional farming. That there were no differences detected between the organic and one conventional system is a major result. This demonstrates that even if organic farming is presently difficult to implement and requires a change of economic context for farmers, considerable and easy improvements in conventional farming are attainable, while maintaining yields and approaching the ecological benefits of organic methods.","Tillage and herbicide reduction mitigate the gap between conventional and organic farming effects on foraging activity of insectivorous bats",0

While practices characteristic of agricultural intensification tend to erode biodiversity, agroecological farming practices can potentially support biodiversity and enhance pest suppression services. Bats are important predators of agricultural pests, yet little is known about how prescriptive management practices can be used to support bats and their associated pest-suppression services. We investigate how bats use natural habitat and conventional and organic farms in an agricultural landscape, ask which on-farm management practices may benefit bats, and examine how these management practices influence bats by mediating changes in habitat quality. We conducted acoustic surveys at 54 sites in the California Central Coast Region, a productive region with high ecological and economic value. We found higher bat activity in natural habitat compared to farms for total bat activity and clutter-adapted, but not open space bats, and slightly higher bat diversity in natural habitat compared to conventional farms. We found no effect of habitat type on species richness and a weak effect of habitat type on bat diversity, although bat community composition differed significantly between natural habitat and farms. Crop diversification increased the activity of all bat species and clutter-adapted, but not open space bats, regardless of the amount of semi-natural habitat surrounding farms. Both crop diversification and less frequent pesticide applications increased prey biomass, and the activity of clutter-adapted bats was positively correlated with greater Lepidoptera biomass. We suggest that improving habitat quality (increasing abundance of insect prey) through vegetative diversification and/or less frequent pesticide applications offers flexible management options to growers by considering both bat ecology and the constraints of regional agricultural management practices.","Agroecological farming practices promote bats",0

We addressed this problem by selecting matched organic-conventional pairs of soybean fields such that in each pair the soybean fields were similar in size, hedgerow length, and surrounding landscape composition within 1 km, 2 km and 3 km of the fields. At each of our 16 field pairs (32 sites), we measured relative differences in bat species richness and abundance using acoustic bat recorders, and bat prey availability using black-light traps. We predicted that organic soybean fields would have greater bat species richness, bat abundance and bat prey abundance than conventional soybean fields due to the prohibition of synthetic pesticides and longer more diverse crop rotations in organic fields, both of which should benefit bat insect prey. We found that organic soybean fields had higher bat species richness, bat abundance and bat prey abundance than conventional fields, after controlling for the effect of differences in soybean height between conventional and organic fields.

We also hypothesized that bat activity would vary between edges and the interior of vineyards in response to prey availability that in turn would be influenced by agricultural management. Bat activity was quantified along edge and the interior of each vineyard type by using acoustic surveys. In addition, we sampled nocturnal flying insects at each site using light traps. Species richness and overall bat activity were significantly higher in organic than conventional vineyards, with organic edges concentrating the highest bat activity. Our results suggest negative effects of agricultural intensification on insectivorous bats. The high bat activity along edges compared to the interior of vineyards suggest that these structural features of the landscape are important components for bat populations in vineyards, and therefore should be considered within agricultural management in order to promote bat abundance and their role as pest suppressors.","Influence of agricultural management on bat activity and species richness in vineyards of central Chile",0

Thus we hypothesize that farmland heterogeneity should also increase bat abundance and richness in agricultural landscapes. Here, we use data on bat activity and richness collected using acoustic surveys in rural eastern Ontario, Canada to test the predictions that there should be greater bat activity and greater species richness in agricultural landscapes with higher Shannon diversity of crops and smaller fields, when controlling for the effect of total crop cover. Bat activity increased with farmland heterogeneity, as predicted. Farmland heterogeneity was also positively related to species richness, although the relationship was not statistically supported.

To date there is limited information on species-specific acceptance of gates at abandoned mines. We designed our research objectives to determine short-term (1 week) behavioral responses of bats to gating, including gate material and height above ground, mid-term (<1 yr) changes in bat use before and after gate installation, and long-term changes (=4 yrs) in use and factors influencing species presence. We used an in situ mock gate experiment, comparison of bat use before and after gating, and genetic identification of guano in gated mines for our short-, mid-, and long-term studies, respectively. In our short-term study, bats increased energetically demanding behaviors following gate installation. Although we detected no difference in responses to gate material or height, a less maneuverable bat species circled, collided, and landed more frequently on gates than did an agile species. In the mid-term study, activity remained stable or increased at 73% of mines after gating compared to before gating, although number of maternity colonies decreased. In the long-term study, elevation, portal area, number of mine levels, and entrances were more important than gates in predicting presence of 4 bat species, including 2 subterranean obligates.

We paid close attention to comparison between gravel-sand pits states and aquatic habitats, because the restoration process in the gravel-sand pits studied often leads to bodies of water and these habitats are among the most favorable for numerous bats species. In addition, we focus our comparisons on arable land because new gravel-sand pit settlements are usually planned on such agricultural land and furthermore because it represents the major land-use pressure for bats. We found that bat activity in gravel-sand pit displays a range comparable to what is observed in numerous habitats, though it does appear both slightly lower than in bodies of water and greater than arable land. Bat activity appears increasing during the gravel-sand pit life's cycle.

Large areas of river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) forests have declined in ecological condition. Thinning has been promoted as a tool to reduce competition in dense, young stands of E. camaldulensis regrowth, yet responses of forest structure and fauna to large-scale thinning are largely unclear. Aims To establish a before-after-control-impact experiment to assess responses of forest structure and fauna to large-scale (compartment-level; ~440 ha) silvicultural thinning. Methods We measured immediate (<2 yrs) responses of forest structural components (living, dead and hollow-bearing stem densities, coarse woody debris (CWD) density and volumes and ground cover) and components of biodiversity (bats, birds, volant insects and non-volant mammals) before and after thinning within five control and three impact compartments. Key results Thinning reduced stem density by approximately two-thirds and was associated with a substantial increase in activity and richness of bats and a change in bat species composition. There was no change in richness for birds and non-volant mammals, nor insect biomass in relation to thinning. However, thinning affected composition of non-volant mammals, with the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) less active post-thinning at impact plots relative to control plots. Thinning reduced the density of dead stems, though these were predominantly small (~13 cm diameter at breast height over bark, or dbhob) and mostly lacked hollows. Hollow-bearing tree density was not affected by thinning. Although thinning increased CWD densities, volume of CWD did not change, indicating that thinning contributed small-sized CWD. Thinning did not affect densities of hollow- and fissure-bearing CWD or ground cover, which was low (<7%) in control and impact plots. There were no other negative effects on biodiversity detected. Conclusions Short-term fauna responses to thinning were generally neutral or positive. Implications Ongoing monitoring is required to detect long-term changes that may result from colonisation or altered breeding success after thinning. We recommend that some unthinned stands should be retained throughout the landscape to provide a mosaic forest structure suitable for a diverse fauna.","Experimental evaluation of the initial effects of large-scale thinning on structure and biodiversity of river red gum (<i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i>) forests",0

There is, however, little empirical evidence to support this assumption. We investigated for the first time how differently grained forest management systems affect the biodiversity of multiple above- and below-ground taxa across spatial scales. We sampled 15 taxa of animals, plants, fungi and bacteria within the largest contiguous beech forest landscape of Germany and classified them into functional groups. Selected forest stands have been managed for more than a century at different spatial grains. The EA (coarse-grained management) and UEA (fine-grained) forests are comparable in spatial arrangement, climate and soil conditions. These were compared to forests of a nearby national park that have been unmanaged for at least 20 years. We used diversity accumulation curves to compare <U+03B3>-diversity for Hill numbers 0D (species richness), 1D (Shannon diversity) and 2D (Simpson diversity) between the management systems. Beta diversity was quantified as multiple-site dissimilarity. Gamma diversity was higher in EA than in UEA forests for at least one of the three Hill numbers for six taxa (up to 77%), while eight showed no difference. Only bacteria showed the opposite pattern. Higher <U+03B3>-diversity in EA forests was also found for forest specialists and saproxylic beetles. Between-stand ß-diversity was higher in EA than in UEA forests for one-third (all species) and half (forest specialists) of all taxa, driven by environmental heterogeneity between age-classes, while a-diversity showed no directional response across taxa or for forest specialists. Synthesis and applications. Comparing EA and uneven-aged forest management in Central European beech forests, our results show that a mosaic of different age-classes is more important for regional biodiversity than high within-stand heterogeneity. We suggest reconsidering the current trend of replacing even-aged management in temperate forests. Instead, the variability of stages and stand structures should be increased to promote landscape-scale biodiversity.","The impact of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on regional biodiversity of multiple taxa in European beech forests",0

Thinning can reduce stem density to accelerate tree growth and potentially restore forest-structural complexity. Yet, in some forest types, it remains unclear how biodiversity responds to thinning, especially over longer periods. White cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla is geographically widespread in Australia and has history of silvicultural thinning in parts of its distribution. We used a chronosequence approach to assess the short- and longer-term responses of multiple taxa (bats, birds, invertebrates, reptiles, non-volant mammals, and plants) to thinning of C. glaucophylla in the dry Pilliga forests of New South Wales. We recorded data from a total of 227 taxa. The short (<8 years)- and longer-term (>20 years) responses to thinning of C. glaucophylla regrowth were mostly positive or neutral for the taxa considered. Bat activity and diversity were comparable to levels in long-undisturbed reference forest, though this was influenced by time since thinning. Reptile diversity and abundance was positively associated with thinning at an intermediate time since thinning (8–20 years), with both metrics greater than unthinned regrowth and long-undisturbed reference forest. Bird diversity was greater in recent and old thinning treatments when compared to unthinned forest regrowth, although species composition was not affected by thinning. Though thinning did not affect volant invertebrate biomass, it was associated with a relatively more even distribution among size classes >8 years post-thinning, and a greater representation of beetles to overall insect biomass. The activity, diversity and composition of non-volant mammals did not differ among treatments, nor did understorey plant diversity or composition. Combining these multiple taxa into a composite ‘biodiversity’ index demonstrated a 16–22% increase with thinning relative to index values in long-undisturbed reference forests. Overall these results indicate that thinning has neutral to positive effects on biodiversity, but responses are species-specific and likely to be dependent on forest-type and the broader landscape of a site. Given unthinned forest represented habitat of similar value to thinned forest for some taxa, we recommend that that regrowth patches of varying size are retained across the landscape to provide a mosaic forest structure suitable for a diverse suite of flora and fauna.","Ecological outcomes for multiple taxa from silvicultural thinning of regrowth forest",0

Over a study period of two years (2012-2013), a standardised acoustic monitoring was conducted on 12 sampling sites comprising different land use types in forests (pine, mixed and deciduous forest) and agricultural areas (arable land and grassland). The focus was on the effect of small-scale changes in structural habitat parameters resulting from management practices within one-and-the-same land use type. We applied a paired sampling design and compared two (forest) and three (agricultural areas) sampling sites (complexity categories) per land use type. An effect of structural complexity was tested using parametric and non-parametric analyses. Sampling sites differ in a complexity index derived from vegetation measurements related to: a) vertical vegetation structure (pine forests), b) tree species composition (mixed forests), c) tree age (deciduous forests), d) crop type (arable land), and e) management intensity (grassland). Within the pine and mixed forest, management practices leading to an increase in structural habitat complexity were associated with a significant increase in bat activity, species richness, and species diversity (H'). This effect is only partially explained by increased prey abundance. On grassland, increased bat abundance is associated with low-intensity management practices. This effect is explainable by an increase in arthropod abundance associated with structural complexity but no additional effect of structural complexity beyond that. On arable land, the difference in structural complexity among different crops (and not prey abundance) significantly affects bat communities. Our approach employed proxy measures of habitat quality to estimate which management practices within the study area theoretically result in suitable and available habitats to meet the requirements of local bat species. Thus, our findings have implications for forest and agricultural management. Even minor changes in silvicultural management (understory development in pine monocultures and increased percentage of deciduous trees in mixed forests) may lead to a significant increase in forest habitat quality for bats. The findings also stress the importance of extensive management practices in grassland, as well as structure-rich crops on arable land to achieve a more environmentally sustainable farmland management.","Bat community responses to structural habitat complexity resulting from management practices within different land use types - a case study from north-eastern Germany",1

Fire can indirectly influence bat activity through changes to understory vegetation, insect prey availability, and roost tree abundance. High-flying bats may be less influenced by fire-induced changes to the understory because they forage above the forest canopy. Fire-dependent forests are prevalent across the range of the endemic Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus), a large, high-flying, and critically endangered species, yet effects of fire management on this species are completely unknown. To investigate short-term responses of these bats to fire, we conducted pre-post-treatment-control experiments in 4 prescribed burns during 2 seasons (dry, wet). For 12 nights pre-burn and 24 nights post-burn, we surveyed bat activity acoustically at 3 sites within each burn (treatment) and 3 adjacent sites (control). Using mixed-effects models to test the effect of treatment on bat activity, we found that bat activity significantly increased post-burn in treatment sites relative to control sites, with more pronounced effects during dry season burns. We also detected significantly more feeding buzzes (foraging activity) in treatment sites than control sites, and a negative trend over time in the burn effect size post-burn. We suggest that bats are attracted to increased availability of insect prey immediately following burns, particularly during the dry season when prey may be limited. Our results suggest that burns have short-term positive effects on Florida bonneted bats and that restoring fire to fire-dependent forests may improve foraging habitat for this species. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.","Activity of an endangered bat increases immediately following prescribed fire",0

We conducted a field experiment to determine how light intensity affects the activity of the light-opportunistic Pipistrellus pipistrellus and light-averse bats in the genus Myotis. We used four lighting levels controlled under a central management system at existing street lights in a suburban environment (0, 25, 50 and 100% of the original output). Higher light intensities (50 and 100% of original output) increased the activity of light-opportunistic species but reduced the activity of light-averse bats. Compared to the unlit treatment, the 25% lighting level did not significantly affect either P. pipistrellus or Myotis spp. Our results suggest that it is possible to achieve a light intensity that provides both economic and ecological benefits by providing sufficient light for human requirements while not deterring light-averse bats.","Effects of dimming light-emitting diode street lights on light-opportunistic and light-averse bats in suburban habitats",0

We model the relative abundance of each taxa and indices using data from a nationwide volunteer-based acoustic survey. We found that three of the six taxa studied exhibit greater relative abundance within Natura 2000 sites (this increase is noteworthy for E. serotinus (× 2.1) and Myotis ssp. (× 3.6)). We also provide evidence that total relative abundance of bat activity and richness are globally higher in Natura 2000 sites (respectively + 24% and + 14%) and on average communities are more specialized within Natura 2000 sites. In addition, when the effect of Natura 2000 is adjusted to the main land use types, a significant positive effect of Natura 2000 remains for most metrics. The positive Natura 2000 effect appears relatively small compared to the main land use pressure: intensive agriculture and artificial light at night.

However, some species were detected more frequently or exclusively by capture. Ideally, the two methods should be used together to compensate for the biases in each. Using combined capture and acoustic data, we found that protected forests, forest fragments, and shade coffee plantations hosted similar and diverse species assemblages, although some species were recorded more frequently in protected forests. Tea plantations contained very few species from the overall bat assemblage. In riparian habitats, a strip of forested habitat on the river bank improved the habitat for bats compared to rivers with tea planted up to each bank. Our results show that shade coffee plantations are better bat habitat than tea plantations in biodiversity hotspots. However, if tea is to be the dominant land use, forest fragments and riparian corridors can improve the landscape considerably for bats. We encourage coffee growers to retain traditional plantations with mature native trees, rather than reverting to sun grown coffee or coffee shaded by a few species of timber trees.","Heard but not seen: comparing bat assemblages and study methods in a mosaic landscape in the Western Ghats of India",0

Artificial roost structures are increasingly being used in conservation efforts for at-risk bat species. To evaluate microhabitat differences in common artificial roost structures and determine if roost selection occurs based on structure type, we installed artificial roosts of three different styles (bat box, rocket box, and bark mimic) in six clusters. We compared size and measured temperature parameters (12 points/roost) while bats were excluded from one cluster. We simultaneously conducted census counts during the active season at five more clusters open to bats for 1-2 years. The rocket box style provided larger entrance area, surface area, and volume versus other roost types. Microclimate varied with roost design. More positions inside the bat box and rocket box stayed within critical temperature limits for bats (0-45°C)-i.e., were usable. The bark-mimic provided less usable space than the rocket box and, often, large proportions of the roost were > 45°C. The rocket box provided the widest temperature availability in a given hour (max range available 7°C) and was more stable than the bark mimic. A maternity colony of Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis) selected the rocket box style; four of five available rocket boxes became primary maternity roosts, with 2-210 bats emerging per night. Future work should aim to manipulate roost size, temperature availability, and temperature stability in isolation to identify which features drive roost microhabitat selection by bats. Comparative studies of artificial roosts account for some inherent irregularity in natural systems, allowing us to study the dynamics of roost microhabitats. We recommend season-long monitoring of microhabitat in novel artificial refuges and comparative studies of artificial and natural roosts, and urge managers to consider potential positive and negative effects when substituting artificial roosts for natural habitat.","In artificial roost comparison, bats show preference for rocket box style",0

In Brazil, the species is presently affected by habitat destruction and fragmentation, driven often by the increase of road density.

Some animals recover fully and would be fit for reintroduction into the wild. However, few attempts have been made to adequately conduct and monitor these reintroductions throughout South and Central America. We here present data on a soft-release experiment with a young male puma which was hit by a vehicle in state of São Paulo, Brazil. After 16 months in a felid conservation center, the animal recovered from the wounds and was transferred to a pre-release fenced area. Diel activity differed between the two enclosures, with that in the latter being closer to what has been described for individuals in the wild (i.e., mainly nocturnal and crepuscular activity). Prior to release, the animal was equipped with a radio collar. Monitoring showed a preference for commercial forests (Pinus spp. and Eucalyptus spp.) and avoidance of pastures and secondary forests. Later, there was a shift towards primary forest. Four hundred and thirty-three days after its release, the animal was killed in another vehicle collision, 55 km from the first one. Although sample size is small and the study period short, our data on activity, habitat preferences, and movements showed that the released animal presented ecological patterns close to those described in wild animals.

However, the number of managed species selected is relatively small and focused on large-bodied, charismatic mammals that are not necessarily under strong threat and not always good candidates for reintroduction into the wild. Two interrelated and more fundamental questions go unanswered: have the major breeding programs succeeded at the basic level of maintaining and expanding populations, and is there room to expand them? I used published counts of births and deaths from 1970 to 2011 to quantify rates of growth of 118 captive-bred mammalian populations. These rates did not vary with body mass, contrary to strong predictions made in the ecological literature. Most of the larger managed mammalian populations expanded consistently and very few programs failed. However, growth rates have declined dramatically. The decline was predicted by changes in the ratio of the number of individuals within programs to the number of mammal populations held in major zoos. Rates decreased as the ratio of individuals in programs to populations increased. In other words, most of the programs that could exist already do exist. It therefore appears that debates over the general need for captive-breeding programs and the best selection of species are moot.

Considerable research efforts are devoted to resolving the mechanisms behind these threats in order to provide a basis for relevant conservation actions. However, even when the underlying mechanisms are known, specific actions aimed at direct support for carnivores are difficult to implement and evaluate at efficient spatial and temporal scales. We report on a 30-year inventory of the critically endangered Fennoscandian arctic fox Vulpes lagopus L., including yearly surveys of 600 fox dens covering 21 000 km2. These surveys showed that the population was close to extinction in 2000, with 40-60 adult animals left. However, the population subsequently showed a fourfold increase in size. During this time period, conservation actions through supplementary feeding and predator removal were implemented in several regions across Scandinavia, encompassing 79% of the area. To evaluate these actions, we examined the effect of supplemental winter feeding and red fox control applied at different intensities in 10 regions. A path analysis indicated that 47% of the explained variation in population productivity could be attributed to lemming abundance, whereas winter feeding had a 29% effect and red fox control a 20% effect. This confirms that arctic foxes are highly dependent on lemming population fluctuations but also shows that red foxes severely impact the viability of arctic foxes. This study also highlights the importance of implementing conservation actions on extensive spatial and temporal scales, with geographically dispersed actions to scientifically evaluate the effects. We note that population recovery was only seen in regions with a high intensity of management actions. Synthesis and applications.

The risk to human safety from such interactions may be mitigated if people could carry a suitably defensive repellent, similar in principle to bear (Ursus spp.) repellent spray advocated in North America. In the first step towards searching for suitable stimuli that might be used as repellents with dingoes, we observed the responses of nine dingoes to three stimuli during interactions with a researcher on Fraser Island. Two treatment stimuli were assumed to be potentially aversive (an air horn blast and a water jet from a motorised water pistol), and one was considered unlikely to be aversive and therefore suitable as a control (a whistle being blown). Responses to the stimuli varied. All nine dingoes were initially presented with the whistle; however, only one adult male responded as if the whistle was aversive. Seven of the nine dingoes were later presented with a whistle and treatment stimuli together. None of the seven dingoes were repelled during any air horn treatment trials; however, six of seven dingoes (all juveniles) were repelled by the water pistol stimulus. Although a water pistol was effective at repelling young dingoes on many occasions, responses between individuals were inconsistent. Results from this pilot study suggest that a water pistol stimulus may offer some protection as a repellent to close approaches by young dingoes, particularly if enhanced with a mild irritant.","Preliminary observations of dingo responses to assumed aversive stimuli",0

Within forestry, diversionary feeding typically targets cervids, and aims to reduce browsing damage and bark-stripping in vulnerable forest stands (young and mid-aged forest stands). Because these stands are most vulnerable during winter, diversionary feeing is often restricted to that season. Despite being widely applied, clear evidence on the effectiveness of diversionary feeding of cervids is lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of diversionary winter feeding as a tool to lure away a large cervid, red deer (Cervus elaphus), from vulnerable forest stands. First, we hypothesized (H1) that diversionary feeding is among the most important factors explaining differences in red deer habitat selection between summer (i.e., no food supply at feeding stations) and winter (i.e., food supply ad libitum at feeding stations). Second, we hypothesized (H2) that diversionary feeding releases red deer habitat selection pressure in forest stands vulnerable for browsing or bark-stripping, and that this release decays with distance to the nearest feeding station. We tested our hypotheses using red deer relocation data (11 individuals & 3 years) and resource selection functions in an intensively managed Austrian forest. As expected, variation in red deer habitat selection between summer and winter was best explained by a different response to supplementary feeding stations between the seasons (H1). During winter, red deer strongly selected for areas close to feeding stations, whereas feeding stations did not strongly affect their habitat selection during summer. We found that diversionary feeding during winter released red deer habitat selection pressure on vulnerable forest stands, but limited to distances of about 1.3 to 1.5 km from the feeding station, this accounts for 39% of the study area (H2). Our results show that diversionary feeding can indeed be an effective tool to mediate habitat selection behavior and to lure cervids away from vulnerable forest stands. However, habitat selection is not necessarily a good proxy for damage, and whether or not diversionary feeding reduces forestry damage in the long-term remains unclear, as it can positively feed-back into survival, reproduction, and eventually population growth and densities. We suggest that forest managers also consider silvicultural measures, population control (i.e., hunting) or spatial planning as means to minimize red deer induced forestry damage.","Diversionary feeding can reduce red deer habitat selection pressure on vulnerable forest stands, but is not a panacea for red deer damage",0

In the year starting in February of 2001, 29 leopards were captured in the human-dominated rural landscape of the Junnar region (4275 km2, 185 people/km2), Maharashtra, India, and released an average of 39.5 km away in adjoining forests. Eleven leopards were also relocated to the same forests from other districts. Prior to the large-scale translocation program, an average of four leopard attacks on humans occurred each year between 1993 and 2001. After the translocation program was initiated, the average increased substantially to 17 attacks. Linear and logistic models showed that attack frequency increased in Junnar following nearby releases of leopards and decreased when leopards were removed for releases far away; that attacks became more lethal when the number of leopards introduced from other districts increased; and that attacks were most likely to occur in the regions where the largest number of leopards had been introduced from other areas. These results suggest that leopards did not stay at the release sites and that translocation induced attacks on people. Potential explanations for these results include increased aggression induced by stress of the translocation process, movement through unfamiliar human-dominated landscapes following release, and loss of fear of humans due to familiarity with humans acquired during captivity. Our results show that reactive solutions to attacks on humans by leopards, such as translocation, could in fact increase human-leopard conflict. Measures to reduce human-carnivore conflicts may include more effective compensation procedures to pay livestock owners for the loss of animals to predation by carnivores, providing better methods of protection for livestock, and encouraging greater social acceptance of the presence of carnivores in human-dominated landscapes. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.","Translocation as a tool for mitigating conflict with leopards in human-dominated landscapes of India",0

Predation on domestic stock can have negative economic impacts particularly for owners of small herds, and tools for minimising carnivore depredation of livestock are needed. Canids use scent marking to establish territories and avoid intraspecific conflict. Exploiting scent-marking behaviour may provide a means for manipulating canid movements. Aims We hypothesised that human-deployed scent marks (i.e. 'biofence') could be used to manipulate the movements of grey wolves (Canis lupus) in Idaho, USA. Methods We deployed 65km of biofence within three wolf-pack territories during summer 2010 and 2011 and used location data from satellite-collared wolves and sign surveys to assess the effectiveness of biofencing. Key results Location data provided by satellite-collared wolves and sign surveys in 2010 showed little to no trespass of the biofence, even though the excluded areas were used by the packs in previous summers. We also opportunistically deployed a biofence in between a rendezvous site of a resident pack and a nearby sheep grazing allotment; the pack was not implicated in any depredations in summer 2010, even though they had killed sheep every year since 2006. Location data provided by satellite-collared wolves in summer 2011 showed that wolves did trespass biofences. Conclusions Biofencing effectively manipulated the movements of wolves in the first year of our study, but not the second. Implications Our work suggests that biofencing may be most limited by the apparent necessity to maintain a continuous presence once the biofence is established. The inherent labour and costs associated with such efforts may limit the usefulness of biofencing. Our work can be improved on through further testing that maintains biofencing over a longer timeframe (>3 months), samples several animals per treatment pack, and uses a treatment and control design.© CSIRO 2013.","No trespassing: using a biofence to manipulate wolf movements",1

Mean den tree size (41.1±2.9cm (s.e.), diameter at breast height (dbh)) was significantly larger than that of available trees (27.5±0.9cm). Dead trees (stags) comprised 52% of 27 dens but comprised only 12% of available trees. This likely reflects the greater frequency of hollows in dead trees compared with other trees. Surveys found that 59% of 720 available trees contained hollows. A much lower percentage of trees in the 10-30-cm dbh size class were hollow-bearing (22%) compared with trees 30cm (77%), and we view these smaller trees as those providing future den trees. Their density varied from 17 to 95ha-1 among sites, which suggests that most sites have an adequate supply of future hollows. We installed 56 nest boxes to determine use by squirrel gliders.

We compared release sites with (n=5) and without (n=1) supplementary food to determine whether site fidelity, body condition and reproduction were affected, and whether these traits aided population establishment. Predator swamping did not facilitate reintroduction success, with no bettongs detected more than 122 days after release. While supplementary food increased site fidelity and persistence at release sites, bettongs failed to establish successfully at any site.

In 1948, to reduce the predation pressure on Pyrenean chamois Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica by golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos, the alpine marmot Marmota marmota was introduced to the Pyrenees in Western Europe. In successive introductions, about 500 marmots were released, but the fate of the released animals and their impacts on the environment remain largely unstudied. The aim of this study was to assess the success of the introduction of the alpine marmot into the Pyrenees, 60 years after the initial release, and the potential impacts of this species on Pyrenean ecosystems. We reviewed what is known about the marmot populations introduced to the Pyrenees and other populations within their native range in the Alps, particularly in terms of population structure and dynamics, habitat use and potential environmental impacts. The alpine marmot is widely distributed and, apparently, well established in the Pyrenees. Population structure and demographic parameters are similar within and outside the historical distribution range of the species, and habitat suitability is one of the main reasons for the species' success in the Pyrenees. Few researchers have investigated the impacts of alpine marmots in the Pyrenees; thus, those impacts have to be inferred from those observed in the species' native range or in other species of marmot. Introduced alpine marmots are likely to impact on Pyrenean grasslands through grazing and burrowing, have the potential to alter Pyrenean food webs and could act as vectors of parasites and disease.

We used a system where human-black bear conflicts were common, to experimentally test the efficacy of education and enforcement in altering human behavior to better secure attractants (garbage) from bears.

We measured human behaviors as the response including: violation of local wildlife ordinances, garbage availability to bears, and change in use of bear-resistance refuse containers. As implemented, we found little support for education, or enforcement in the form of daily patrolling in changing human behavior, but found more support for proactive enforcement, i.e., dispensing warning notices. More broadly we demonstrated the value of gathering evidence before and after implementing conservation actions, and the dangers of measuring responses in the absence of ecological knowledge. We recommend development of more effective educational methods, application of proactive enforcement, and continued evaluation of tools by directly measuring change in human behavior.

A key decision when developing a reintroduction strategy is whether to include a temporary period of confinement prior to release. Pre-release confinement is primarily used for the purpose of quarantine or as a delayed-release tactic to influence the performance or behaviour of founders post-release. A common difference between these approaches is that quarantine tends to be conducted in ex situ captivity, whereas delayed releases tend to involve in situ confinement at the release site. Although these practices are commonly viewed independently, it may be possible for a single confinement period to be used for both purposes. We tested whether temporarily holding wild eastern bettongs Bettongia gaimardi in ex situ captivity for 95-345 days prior to release (delayed release) influenced their body mass, pouch occupancy or survival during the first 1.5 years post-release, compared to founders released without confinement (immediate release). Our results suggest that exposing founders to captivity did not alter their body mass or performance post-release, despite being heavier and having fewer pouch young when released. We conclude that, for this species, ex situ captivity does not represent a tactical opportunity to improve post-release performance but can be used for quarantine without affecting the probability of establishment.","The effect of pre-release captivity on post-release performance in reintroduced eastern bettongs <i>Bettongia gaimardi</i>",0

Survival rates in these programs ranged from 0.50 to 1.00 and were similar among the 3 species. The primary causes of mortality were sport hunting and road kills for American black bears, intra-specific predation and illegal kills for brown bears, and natural mortalities and illegal kills for Asiatic black bears. Although American and Asiatic black bears were involved in conflicts post-release, the majority of released bears (94%) were not documented in conflict situations. Movement patterns of captive-reared American black and brown bears showed no homing tendencies toward their rearing facility. Twenty captive-reared bears produced 21 litters.

Patterns of survival were best explained by rearing environment and its interaction with time, although disparities in survival between wild-born and captive-reared animals decreased over time. Higher mortality among captive-reared individuals may have been due to more exploratory behavior, as captive-reared woodrats used more dens and traveled farther among successive relocations than wild-born conspecifics. Soft-released individuals had higher initial survival rates and tended to choose dens similar to those of wild individuals, providing evidence that this strategy eased the transition to a wild environment. We recommend future programs use soft-release techniques but also explore other pre-release preparatory strategies such as anti-predator conditioning and environmental enrichment to increase survival.","Post-release survival of captive-reared Allegheny woodrats",0

Forest managers' success in emulating understory forest ecosystem functions, e.g., for the provision of habitat even for large mammals, has not been tested due, in many cases, to incomplete records of silviculture. We examined regenerating areas of previously conifer-dominated forests in northwestern Ontario, Canada, 10 and 30. years after logging and 10 and 30. years after fire to test if understory development and moose (Alces alces) forage abundance differed between the two disturbance types and artificial or natural regeneration approaches. In addition, we counted moose pellet groups as a measure of moose use of the region. Specific treatments included: (1) naturally regenerating, fire-origin forests, (2) post-harvest, regenerating forests with natural establishment of trees, and (3) post-harvest, regenerating forests with mechanical or chemical site preparation and planting and/or herbicide spraying. We hypothesized that the understory in post-harvest stands would support higher forage availability for moose compared to similarly-aged, fire-origin stands. Abundance of hardwoods, shrubs, and herbaceous plants was greater in naturally-regenerated post-harvest stands than in fire-origin and artificially regenerated post-harvest stands at both 10 and 30. years post-disturbance. However, post-harvest, naturally regenerating stands were not significantly associated with higher moose use, rather evidence of moose use increased as a function of the amount of naturally regenerating logged forest in the surrounding landscape. This study suggests that, relative to fire, the intensity of post-harvest silviculture influences habitat suitability for moose. The effect likely cascades to other ungulates, such as woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), and vegetation management needs to be considered at scales greater than the stand level in order to achieve habitat management for large mammals. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Influence of post-harvest silviculture on understory vegetation: Implications for forage in a multi-ungulate system",0

The migratory Fortymile caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herd in Alaska reached a low of approximately 6,000 caribou during 1973–1975. To regain peak numbers of approximately 50,000 caribou estimated in the 1960s, stakeholder groups gained approval for conservative harvest rates (1973–2013) and periods of restricted nonlethal (1998–2004) and lethal wolf (Canis lupus) control (2005–2013). We studied demography of the herd using radio-telemetry during 1990–2014, when herd size increased from about 22,000 to 52,000 caribou. Parturition rates in the early 1990s were among the highest reported, but parturition rates of primiparous females subsequently declined to a level indicating resource-limitation as caribou numbers approached and then exceeded 50,000. This and companion studies documented several other cautionary signals to an eventual decline, including declining October calf weights, early summer movement off the alpine and subalpine tundra to lower elevation spruce–moss taiga, relatively high caribou densities, a nearly 40-year history of increasing caribou numbers, and a return to previous peak numbers. We studied mortality of calves and older females during the 4 years before wolf control and the first 5 years of nonlethal wolf control. During those 9 years, annual mortality rates averaged 54% for calves and 9% for adult females. We detected no convincing support for decreased wolf predation during nonlethal control. We also detected no support for increased caribou survival during nonlethal or lethal wolf control. Based on counts of caribou during summer aggregations using a total search photocensus technique, rate of herd increase (<U+03BB>r) was negligible (<U+03BB>r = 1.00) during 1990–1995, highest during the 3 years immediately before nonlethal wolf control (<U+03BB>r = 1.11, 1995–1998), moderate during nonlethal wolf control (<U+03BB>r = 1.07, 1998–2003), and low during the period that included the first 5 years of lethal wolf control (<U+03BB>r = 1.02, 2003–2010). We combined observed cause of death with the 9 annual modeled starting populations (all newborn calves and adults) and estimated that wolves killed 10–15% of the populations annually, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) killed 4–7%, other predators killed 2–4%, nonpredation factors killed 1–2%, and hunters killed =2%. Wolves killed 5–9% of the annual populations as calves and 5–6% as adults. In retrospect, nonlethal wolf control efforts were too localized to decrease wolf numbers (e.g., adjacent untreated wolf packs reached max. mean numbers). Lethal wolf control efforts had only seasonal and localized effects on wolf numbers. It is important that stakeholders focus on describing a preferred, sustainable herd size, or nutritional status and proceed toward managing this increasing herd in a sustainable manner because, when ungulates overshoot carrying capacity, the effects of high density, adverse weather, and increased predation can have synergistic negative effects on prey numbers and long-lasting negative effects on sustainable yields, contrary to the intended purpose of the wolf control programs. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","Demography of an increasing caribou herd with restricted wolf control",1

Studies on road mortalities were the most prevalent (n=29, with 12 on macropods only), revealing both spatial and temporal patterns in occurrence. Behavioural studies in relation to the road environment are limited (n=2) yet could help our understanding of patterns of road-kill and other impacts. Some macropod populations are critically affected by the presence of roads (e.g. brush-tailed rock-wallaby, Petrogale penicillata) due to either proportionately high road mortalities and/or population fragmentation, and may face continued decline unless effective road-mitigation measures are implemented. Investigations of various types of road mitigation focussed on wildlife-exclusion fencing and road crossing structures as the most effective option, although the high cost of these measures appears to limit their implementation.

Little research has focused on management options to deal with this confl ict. We better defi ne lethal and nonlethal management strategies associated with proactive and reactive management of coyotes with an emphasis on management of problem individuals. We then provide data from research in the Denver Metropolitan Area (DMA), Colorado, USA that focused on reactive lethal removal of problem coyotes and reactive nonlethal hazing (i.e., community-level hazing, a commonly recommended strategy that we better defi ne). The primary lethal management strategy being used in the DMA is to remove problem coyotes only when severe confl ict (primarily threats to people) occurs. From 2009-2014, there were 27 removal events (4.5/ year) with the average number of coyotes removed per event being 2.1 (range 1-11) and the average number of coyotes removed per year being 9.3. The estimated percentage of coyotes removed per year from the population was between 1.0 and 1.8%. We also measured recurrence of confl ict (i.e., length of time until another severe confl ict occurred in the vicinity of a removal event) as a measure of effi cacy. Of the 27 removals, there were 9 with recurrence with an average of 245 days (range 30-546) between removals, and 18 events without recurrence and with a mean time since confl ict event of 1,042 days (range 133-2,159). For our community-level hazing experiment, we used wildlife cameras to record activity of both people and coyotes at 4 sites (2 treatment and 2 control). At treatment sites with a prior history of confl ict, we educated and encouraged people to haze visible coyotes and hypothesized that hazing would decrease the activity overlap between people and coyotes on treatment sites. We recorded > 50,000 independent sightings of people and coyotes and found activity overlap between humans and coyotes to be either similar or greater on treatment sites compared to control sites. Our results indicate that reactive nonlethal hazing as conducted in this study was ineff ective in reducing human-coyote activity overlap. However, due to a variety of reasons we detail below, we encourage readers to interpret the hazing results with caution. We conclude that reactive lethal removal of problem individuals is an eff ective means of managing confl ict and that proactive nonlethal strategies are critical as well.","Evaluating lethal and nonlethal management options for urban coyotes",0

Animal behaviour can be expected to provide a more direct evidence for a possible effect of reflectors. In this study, we analyse roe deer behaviour in the presence of a blue semicircle reflector, one of the most frequently applied wildlife warning reflectors in Germany and other parts of Europe. Behavioural response to these reflectors (classified as no reaction, vigilance, short-distance flight and long-distance flight) was recorded both under controlled experimental conditions with captive roe deer and for free-ranging roe deer at road sections with traffic occurrence. We used generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) to test if reflector presence induced threat-related behaviour (vigilance, flight) and movement away from the reflectors. We found no significant evidence that the light stimulus emitted by reflectors was perceived as a threat or induced evasive movement.

Results were compared with those from field margins on a second, experimental treatment (ELS Extra: ELSX) in which 5% of cropped land was taken out of production, and also field margins on a conventionally-farmed control treatment ('cross compliance': CC). Species richness and abundance of small mammals showed a significant increase on all treatments in spring and autumn. Many increases were greater on ELS and ELSX field margins compared to the CC controls, but there was little evidence that ELSX was more beneficial than ELS, and there were species-specific differences. Voles were not detected on any treatment in the initial sampling period but bank voles Myodes glareolus rapidly became abundant thereafter, particularly on ELS and ELSX field margins, and field voles Microtus agrestis also colonised.

During our 5-year study, estimates of occurrence probabilities declined for all 12 species detected. These declines occurred primarily in conjunction with variation in estimates of local extinction probabilities (cajun chorus frog [Pseudacris fouquettei], spring peeper [P. crucifer], northern cricket frog [Acris crepitans], Cope's gray treefrog [Hyla chrysoscelis], green treefrog [H. cinerea], squirrel treefrog [H. squirella], southern leopard frog [Lithobates sphenocephalus], bronze frog [L. clamitans], American bullfrog [L. catesbeianus], and Fowler's toad [Anaxyrus fowleri]). For 2 species (eastern narrowmouthed toad [Gastrophryne carolinensis] and Gulf Coast toad [Incilius nebulifer]), declines in occupancy appeared to be a consequence of both increased local extinction and decreased colonization events. The eastern narrow-mouthed toad experienced a 2.5-fold increase in estimates of occupancy in 2004, possibly because of the high amount of rainfall received during that year, along with a decrease in extinction and increase in colonization of new sites between 2003 and 2004. Our model can be incorporated into monitoring programs to estimate simultaneously the occupancy dynamics for multiple species that show similar responses to ecological conditions. It will likely be an important asset for those monitoring programs that employ the same methods to sample assemblages of ecologically similar species, including those that are rare. By combining information from multiple species to decrease the variance on estimates of individual species, our results are advantageous compared to single-species models.

Hare presence/absence, based on faecal pellets, was assessed in 150 1-m radius plots. Hares positively selected edges and avoided woods and stubble during both feeding activity and resting time, which highlights the key role of permanent linear cover in providing the variety of vegetation types required by hares for shelter and feed. Forms were typically located in covered places, surrounded by denser vegetation than sample plots, in order to gain protection from avian and terrestrial predators. Arboriculture stands seem to be able to satisfy a part of hare habitat requirement, thanks to ground flora that provide tasty food, and tree cover that offers refuge against predators and bad weather conditions.

We trapped around each underpass five times to determine the size of the populations of these two species. Bandicoots and bobtail lizards were marked with passive implant transponders (PIT) and PIT readers and motion-activated infrared cameras recorded the number of crossings and the number of individuals that used each underpass. For bandicoots the mean weekly frequency of use corrected for population size and the proportion of the marked population that used each underpass were modelled against factors hypothesized to impact underpass use using generalized linear models. These were underpass length, cross-sectional area, vegetation cover at the entrances, presence or absence of logs and branches in the underpass (furniture), use by introduced predators and time since construction. Underpass length was negatively correlated with the frequency of use by bandicoots and time since construction was negatively correlated with the proportion of the population that used the underpasses. For western bobtail lizards none of the factors tested were strongly correlated with the frequency of use, or the proportion of the population that used the underpass. Based on these results, we recommend that the length of underpasses be kept to a minimum, possibly through the use of vegetated median strips allowing shorter underpasses to connect habitat on either side of the road.

We predicted that the effects of farming practices on small mammal populations would vary with the degree of habitat specialization of species. We expected higher species richness and abundance of specialist species in border habitats of organic than on conventional farms. We found that farming practices did not explain species richness; the number of species in border habitats was low with small variation between managements. Management, season and vegetation volume explained abundance of both specialist and generalist species in border habitats, but with additive effects in the former and interactive effects in the latter. During summer, Calomys musculinus, Calomys laucha and Akodon azarae were more abundant in border habitats of organic than on conventional farms. This could be related to the highest reproductive activity of these species in this season, associated to the highest habitat quality of organic border habitats. Also, organic farms may have an important role for specialist species in poor-quality habitats at the beginning and at the end of the reproductive period (spring and autumn).

The program was designed to allow unhindered foraging opportunities for bears, decrease the risk of habituation, and provide safety for backcountry users. The objective of our study was to evaluate human-bear interaction in BMAs and determine if they were effective. We used human and grizzly bear global positioning system location data to study 6 of 16 BMAs from 2007 to 2009. We contrasted data when BMAs were unrestricted (open human access) and restricted (limited human access). We used location data collected when BMAs were unrestricted to delineate a human recreation area (HRA) and determined a daily human active and inactive period. We applied the HRA and daily activity times to bear location data and evaluated how bear movement behavior changed when people were present and absent. We found that grizzly bears were twice as likely to be within the HRA when BMAs were restricted. We also found that grizzly bears were more than twice as likely to be within the HRA when BMAs were unrestricted, but people were inactive.

After 1,000 iterations, we estimated that predator exclusion provided an additional 18 ± 0.13 (x¯ ± SE; median = 15, interquartile range [IQR] = 9-24) recruits/year above that expected without exclusion. Simulated neonate/adult female ratio was 0.74 ± 0.03 (median = 0.72, IQR = 0.52-0.93) with exclosures and 0.41 ± 0.008 (median = 0.39, IQR = 0.21-0.58) without. Simulated exclosure impact on recruitment was most sensitive to white-tailed deer relative use of exclosures and was least sensitive to neonate survival inside exclosures. We suggest that predator exclusion may be an effective mechanism for reducing neonate mortality and increasing white-tailed deer recruitment in areas where neonate survival is affected by predation. Exclosures may be particularly valuable on small parcels of land where predator removal would be offset by immigration. Finally, exclosures provide refuge from predators throughout the year, and we hypothesize exclosures may also contribute to adult survival and reduce impacts of predation risk that may also affect white-tailed deer population dynamics. Additional research incorporating variation in exclosure size and white-tailed deer density is needed to better evaluate predator exclosures for creating neonate refugia and mitigating sub-lethal impacts of predation.","Predator exclusion as a management option for increasing white-tailed deer recruitment",0

Woodrats are considered generalists in habitat and diet, yet a steady decline in natural stick nests and capture rates over the past several decades suggests that they are limited by the availability of nesting habitat due to habitat loss and fragmentation. The more specialized Key Largo cotton mouse appears to rely on old growth hammock, a habitat type that is rare following past land clearing. In 2004, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service started building supplemental nest structures to restore habitat quality and connectivity for these endangered rodents, but nest use requires evaluation. We used camera traps and occupancy models to evaluate the factors influencing woodrat and cotton mouse use of the supplemental nests. We detected woodrats at 65 and cotton mice at 175 of 284 sampled nest structures, with co-occurrence at 38 nests. Woodrat nest use followed a gradient from low nest use in the north to high nest use in the south, which might relate to the proximity of free-ranging domestic cat (Felis catus) colonies in residential developments. Cotton mouse nest use, however, was related positively to mature hammock and related negatively to disturbed areas (e.g. scarified lands). The two species occurred independently of each other. Stick-stacking behavior was observed at supplemental nests and, although it was correlated with detection of woodrats, it was not a strong predictor of their occurrence. We suggest that nest supplementation can be an important tool for species recovery as habitat quality continues to improve with succession.","Evaluating nest supplementation as a recovery strategy for the endangered rodents of the Florida Keys",0

Thus, there is a need to develop restoration and management strategies that facilitate and accelerate faunal recolonisation. This requires identification of habitat features that act as filters to slow or prevent recolonisation and whether those filters are temporally unidirectional or dynamic. 2.We investigated successional patterns of reptiles and mammals in restored mine-pits in south-western Australia to identify potential filters to faunal recolonisation. We sampled reptiles and small mammals using 30 trapping grids across each of four restoration ages (4, 8, 12 and 17-years old) and unmined forest and assessed vegetation structure to identify animal-habitat relationships. 3.Mammal communities in restored areas converged on unmined forest communities as restoration matured, and all species recolonised rapidly, indicating there were no filters to mammal recolonisation. In contrast, reptile communities did not converge in the same way, indicating there were filters that slowed or prevented reptile recolonisation. We identified three reptile species that were slow, or failed, to recolonise restored areas and a fourth species that rapidly recolonised but disappeared as restoration matured. We identified low coarse woody debris (CWD) volumes and high overstorey stem densities as likely filters; the former is a unidirectional filter that will decrease gradually over long time frames, possibly centuries, while the latter is a dynamic filter that fluctuates in its intensity over short time frames of years. 4.Synthesis and applications. Our study adds to growing evidence that filters to faunal recolonisation may be widespread in restored areas, with important implications for restoration practices. Firstly, examining individual species may more effectively identify filters than examining community successional patterns. Secondly, filters can persist over long time frames, possibly centuries, so management, such as the provision and accelerated development of CWD, may need to occur over similar time frames. Lastly, filters can be dynamic and repeated management interventions, such as thinning, may be required to overcome these filters. The growing evidence for filters suggests that facilitating faunal recolonisation is more complex than simply returning vegetation to restoration sites.

Fauna plays a critical role in the re-establishment of a functional ecosystem, yet fauna recolonization of restored areas is less studied than flora. We reviewed the findings of 71 publications on fauna recolonization, through the example of mining rehabilitation in the Australian continent, a global stronghold of large-scale mining.Species densities and richness were frequently lower in rehabilitated compared to undisturbed areas, even more so when only native species were considered. Amongst all criteria used to measure success, recovery of the pre-mining fauna community composition was the hardest to achieve. Introduced species were often found in rehabilitated areas but further research is needed to determine the duration of this association. Meta-analyses of the factors influencing mining rehabilitation success for fauna revealed that fauna groups recolonized heterogeneously. Recolonization was dependent on the methods used to rehabilitate and the number of years since rehabilitation. Notably, methods combining the use of fresh topsoil with the addition of seeds and seedlings were most successful for fauna recolonization, both in term of fauna density and richness.Limitations to this review included strong biases toward certain mining companies, as well as missing data, which decreased the power of meta-analysis. Available publications did not evenly represent all fauna taxa and studies were short when compared to the time needed to re-construct whole ecosystems. We consider the development of comprehensive fauna standards for assessing rehabilitation success critical.

Because most populations in Utah occur on private land, this threatened species is continually in conflict with landowners. The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources has been relocating Utah prairie dogs from private to public land since the 1970s, but relocations have been largely unsuccessful because of high mortality. Utah prairie dogs are highly social animals, but they are usually relocated without regard to their family group, or coterie. We predicted that relocating Utah prairie dogs with other coterie members would improve their survival rate and result in post-release behavior similar to non-relocated animals. We chose to investigate release-site retention as a measure of relocation success because we were unable to separate emigration from mortality. We relocated Utah prairie dogs from the Cedar Ridge Golf Course in Cedar City, Utah to 2 prepared sites near Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah in 2010 and 2011. We relocated prairie dogs as groups of coterie members or in a control group of individuals trapped with no regard to relatedness. Two months after relocation, we set traps to recapture animals to estimate release-site retention. We quantified activity budgets prior to and following relocation on study animals as well as from a previously established relocated prairie dog population on public land. The best predictor of release-site retention and recapture rate was the animal's weight at initial capture. Larger animals had high retention but low recapture rates. We found no differences in site retention or behavior between prairie dogs relocated with coteries and controls. Relocated individuals behaved more like prairie dogs on public lands than animals in the urban source population, but behaviors were still different from prairie dogs on public lands. We recommend relocating large, adult Utah prairie dogs rather than juveniles or relocating juveniles later in the trapping season to increase relocation success rate. We also suggest that future research should focus on developing additional release methods to reduce dispersal and increase site retention. © 2014 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2014.","The effect of coterie relocation on release-site retention and behavior of Utah prairie dogs",0

We analysed island fox diet on San Nicolas Island during 2006-12 to assess the influence of the removal of feral cats (Felis catus) on the food use by foxes. Our objective was to determine whether fox diet patterns shifted in response to the cat removal conducted during 2009-10, thus indicating that cats were competing with foxes for food items. We also examined the influence of annual precipitation patterns and fox abundance on fox diet. On the basis of an analysis of 1975 fox scats, use of vertebrate prey - deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), birds, and lizards - increased significantly during and after the complete removal of cats (n=66) from the island. Deer mouse abundance increased markedly during and after cat removal and use of mice by foxes was significantly related to mouse abundance. The increase in mice and shift in item use by the foxes was consistent with a reduction in exploitative competition associated with the cat removal. However, fox abundance declined markedly coincident with the removal of cats and deer mouse abundance was negatively related to fox numbers. Also, annual precipitation increased markedly during and after cat removal and deer mouse abundance closely tracked precipitation. Thus, our results indicate that other confounding factors, particularly precipitation, may have had a greater influence on fox diet patterns.","Diet patterns of island foxes on San Nicolas Island relative to feral cat removal",0

Three key actions, i) compensation of canids (wolf and dog) damage; ii) a subsidy system to promote good livestock husbandry practices; iii) promotion of preventive measures, were used to prevent and compensate damage caused by wolves. Direct damage was verified by veterinarians and refunded according to an annually updated price list. In addition indirect losses were compensated on a lump-sum basis proportional to the herd size for each attack. Since 2007 a subsidy system has rewarded shepherds who, pasturing within the home range of wolf packs and in neighbouring areas, have adopted good management practices and preventive measures. Ad hoc damage prevention plans have mainly addressed chronic situations. Changes in animal husbandry (removal of dead livestock from pastures, confining sick animals, synchronizing births and using shed lambing), promotion of use of electric fences and introduction of livestock guarding dogs (LGDs) have been the most common interventions. A new model of electrified net has been developed and LGDs have been selected and diffused; LGDs behavioural research is in progress.

Furthermore, because of the undeniable difficulty of small-mammal track identification, most biologists usually carry out general surveys without species recognition. We hypothesized that general surveys traditionally used for monitoring WRC by small mammals may be biased because the degraded habitats along roads are mainly used by generalist and not specialist species. For this reason, we compared the results of a general small-mammal survey with those from a species-specific one, focusing on 3 study species: 1 habitat generalist (North American deer mouse [Peromyscus maniculatus]), 1 forest specialist (southern red-backed vole [Myodes gapperi]), and 1 prairie specialist (meadow vole [Microtus pennsylvanicus]). We sampled along 4 types of WCS (overpasses, open-span underpasses, and both elliptical and box culverts) in Banff National Park (Canada), by placing footprint track tubes along the WCS, and as a reference in front of their entrances (mainly located in roadside grasslands) and in the surrounding woodlands. Using the traditional general survey, we did not detect significant differences in small-mammal presence among WCS and reference sites. In contrast, species-specific surveys showed that only the deer mouse (a generalist species) consistently used the WCS. The deer mice did not show preferences for any WCS type, whereas the specialist species (voles) used only overpasses. Therefore, general surveys used without species identification can underestimate the value of WCS for specialist small mammals, with relevant conservation implications. As a consequence, we recommend species-specific surveys of WCS suitability for small mammals. We also suggest improving the habitat (or at least the cover availability) in the WCS and along the space between them and the surrounding environments to increase WCS suitability for specialist species.","General versus specific surveys: estimating the suitability of different road-crossing structures for small mammals",0

Soft-release measures, including acclimatisation, have been used for many species around the world, based on the reasoning that gradual and supported reintroductions should improve the success of animals released into an unfamiliar wild environment. However, experimental testing of soft-release methods is rare. Aims To experimentally test the effect of a soft-release method versus a hard-release method on the initial reintroduction success of the eastern barred bandicoot (Perameles gunnii). Methods We released 12 captive-bred eastern barred bandicoots into a predator-proof reserve using two methods: soft-release (7 days of on-site acclimatisation with supplementary food before release) and hard-release (no acclimatisation and no supplementary food). We monitored the bandicoots intensively via radio-tracking and live-trapping for 4 weeks after release. Compared with hard-release bandicoots, we predicted that soft-release bandicoots would have (1) reduced movement (first night dispersal, site fidelity and activity range), (2) more directed patterns of habitat selection, (3) improved bodyweights and (4) improved survival. Key results There was no detectable difference in habitat selection, overall weight change and survival between the soft-release and hard-release groups. There was moderate evidence that, compared with the hard-release group, soft-release bandicoots moved less, demonstrated lower individual variation in all measures of movement, and lost weight more gradually after release. In most cases, effect sizes were moderate to large but had large standard errors owing to both small sample size and high variance. Consequently, statistical testing failed to detect significant differences at the 5% level. Conclusions Despite evidence that the release method influenced some of the monitored behaviours, soft-release did not confer a consistent and substantive advantage for captive-bred eastern barred bandicoots at our site. We conclude that soft-release is unlikely to improve overall reintroduction success for this species at fenced predator-free sites. Implications The present study suggests that the preferred option for reintroductions of eastern barred bandicoots to fenced sites is a hard-release, information that is now being used to guide reintroductions of this species. Similar experiments should be undertaken to improve reintroduction practice for other endangered species.","Soft-release versus hard-release for reintroduction of an endangered species: An experimental comparison using eastern barred bandicoots (<i>Perameles gunnii</i>)",1

Reintroductions are often time consuming, expensive, and controversial, and thus understanding what aspects are important for a successful program is needed. Focusing on the example of the reintroduction of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) to Colorado, we investigated how different release protocols (RP) affected mortality within the first year post-release. We found that average monthly mortality in the study area during the first year decreased with time in captivity from 0.205 (95% CI = 0.069, 0.475) for lynx having spent up to 7 days in captivity to 0.028 (95% CI = 0.012, 0.064) for lynx spending >45 days in captivity before release. Our results also suggest that keeping lynx in captivity beyond 5-6 weeks accrued little benefit in terms of monthly survival. We found that, on a monthly average basis, lynx were as likely to move out (P = 0.196, SE = 0.032) as well as back onto (P = 0.143, SE = 0.034) the reintroduction area during the first year after release. Mortality was 1.6 times greater outside of the study area, suggesting that permanent emigration and differential mortality rates on and off reintroduction areas should be factored into sample size calculations for an effective reintroduction effort. A post-release monitoring plan is critical to providing information to assess aspects of RP and to improve survival of individuals.

Our research objectives were to 1) assess white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) highway crossing patterns and permeability, 2) compare deer permeability on 4-lane reconstructed and 2-lane control sections to determine the influence of wildlife underpasses, and 3) assess and compare deer passage relationships to traffic volume. We fitted 13 deer with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars between 2004 and 2007. Eleven deer crossed the highway 395 times. On 2 control sections, deer crossed an average of 0.02 times/day, while on 3 reconstructed sections they averaged 15 times more crossings/day (0.28; t 13 = -2.35; P = 0.035). The deer passage rate on control sections averaged 0.03 crossings/approach, approximately 20% of that for reconstructed sections (0.16; t 13 = -2.43; P = 0.030). We linked hourly traffic volumes to our GPS data to examine how passage rates and the proportion of deer relocations at different distances from the highway varied with traffic volume. Deer distance from the highway showed minimal shift away from the highway with increased traffic, and at-grade passage rates were low (=0.1 crossings/approach) across all traffic volumes. Although our linear regression analysis found no relationship between deer passage rate and increasing traffic volume on reconstructed sections with underpasses, there was a strong negative relationship on control sections (r = -0.881; P = 0.05); thus, we conclude that deer passage rates were minimally affected by traffic on reconstructed sections where passage structures facilitated below-grade passage. Further, from the 865 deer groups we recorded on videotape at 5 underpasses, traffic levels did not affect below-grade deer passage at the volumes we studied.

In grasslands, burning may have this effect for mammalian herbivores by decreasing vegetation height, potentially making burned areas safer habitats. However, few studies have tested the impacts of burning on the perceived predation risk of herbivores. Vigilance can be used as a measure of habitat safety and therefore should be lower in burned areas than unburned areas. We tested the impacts of prescribed burning on vigilance by Thomson's gazelles in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Both individual vigilance, proportion of time an individual spends looking, and group vigilance, proportion of a group looking, of Thomson's gazelles was observed in burned and unburned areas before and after presenting a model cheetah to each group. Surprisingly, both individual and group vigilance was the same in both habitats pre- and post-cheetah addition and removal. This is despite the fact that both vegetation height and biomass were lower in burned areas than unburned areas.

Hamster occurrence was negatively related to vegetation density and grass cover on sown wildflower fields and positively related to distance to the nearest forests, percentage of arable land and fallow land around wildflower fields. In conclusion, we could show that sown wildflower fields can be an ideal habitat for non-target species, such as the common hamster.

Even with an increase in the number of reserves, protecting wildlife has proven difficult and many reserves remain little different from unprotected areas. In Brazil, private landowners are being encouraged by federal and state governments and non-governmental organizations to participate in a national conservation strategy by setting aside land for preservation. However, due to chronic hunting pressure, the role that private reserves might play remains to be determined. In this study we analyze the potential of private reserves through a case study of the Reserva Ecológica Michelin in Bahia, Brazil. We measured the relative abundances of medium and large mammals before and after the implementation of guard patrols, to determine the efficacy of this management strategy for protecting wildlife. The relative abundance of the fauna increased by 72.6 % after the initiation of guard patrols, from 5.07 to 8.68 encounters/10 km, with preferred game species (Dasypus novemcinctus, Cuniculus paca, Pecari tajacu, and Mazama americana) increasing by 146.7-300%. Similarities between the relative abundances of preferred game species at our site after the initiation of the guard patrols and those of other protected Neotropical reserves indicate that the Michelin reserve is now being effectively protected. Although the cost of $9.4/ha to protect the reserve is high, this study shows that the private reserve initiative can be an effective component of the national conservation strategy. © Kevin M.

Predation by feral cats Felis sylvestris catus is one hypothesised cause. Most evidence of cat impacts on native prey comes from islands, where cat densities are often high, but cats typically occur at low densities on mainland Australia. We conducted a field experiment to measure the effect of predation by low-density cat populations on the demography of a native small mammal. We established two 12·5-ha enclosures in tropical savanna in the Northern Territory. Each enclosure was divided in half, with cats allowed access to one half but not the other. We introduced about 20 individuals of a native rodent, Rattus villosissimus, into each of the four compartments (two enclosures × two predator-access treatments). We monitored rat demography by mark-recapture analysis and radiotracking, and predator incursions by camera surveillance and track and scat searches. Rat populations persisted over the duration of the study (18 months) in the predator-proof treatment, where we detected no predator incursions, but declined to extinction in both predator-accessible compartments. In one case, cat incursions were frequently detected and the rat population was rapidly extirpated (<3 months); in the other, cat incursions were infrequent, and the population declined more gradually (c. 16 months) due to low recruitment. We detected no incursions by dingoes Canis dingo, the other mammalian predator in the area. Synthesis and applications. This is the first study to provide direct evidence that cats are capable of extirpating small mammals in a continental setting, in spite of their low population densities. This finding supports the hypothesis that predation by feral cats is contributing to declines of small mammals in northern Australia.

Elk (Cervus elaphus) accounted for 68% of recorded animals, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (O. hemionus) accounted for 13% and 6%, respectively. As elk and white-tailed deer were the only species adequately represented across all UP, we used logistic regression to further evaluate factors associated with successful use of UP. To evaluate habituation over time we limited this analysis to 5 UP monitored for =4 yr. For elk, structural attributes and placement, season, time of day, and months monitored were associated with successful elk UP crossing in year 1, however, by year 4 only structural attributes and placement were significant, suggesting that UP structure and placement likely were of primary importance for successful elk passage. By year 4, probabilities of crossing at 4 of 5 UP converged on >0.70, indicating that given sufficient time to allow habituation, most UP we evaluated appeared to be effective for elk, regardless of structural attributes or placement. For deer, only structural attribute and placement were significant, and aside from one structure did not increase in probability of a successful crossing over time.

Effects of this ectoparasite on wolves were persistent with moderate to severe clinical signs of pediculosis lasting multiple generations. Our objectives were to evaluate the extent of lice infestation on wolves within the Tanana Flats and develop a management program that limited further transmission. We implemented a treatment method that consisted of multiple applications of oral antiparasitic ivermectin-injected baits aerially distributed at den and rendezvous sites during mid-May through August. During 2005-2010, we evaluated 12-19 packs annually as part of a treatment group and 3 infested packs as a control.

The spatial distribution of these species in regard to anthropogenic (distances to ranger stations, villages and park border) and environmental variables (distance to water resources, average slope and normalized difference vegetation index) was assessed using systematic line transect sampling (186 km) and camera trapping (1150 trap nights). The studied steppe area is divided into three management zones differing in the number of ranger stations and their position with respect to park boundaries. The results of multivariate analyses highlighted that the distance to ranger stations was negatively related to the size and density of urial clusters and the most important variable in explaining urial distribution. Moreover, the distance to park borders influenced urial cluster density. Leopard abundance was positively associated with urial density but was less affected by the other variables tested. We found urial densities in the three management zones to range from 0.15 ± se 0.09 individuals km-2 (zone with just one station outside the park) to 21.77 ± se 7.92 individuals km-2 (zone with three stations). Taking into account these results and historical data on ungulate abundance and distribution in these management zones, we conclude that law enforcement from ranger stations has shaped current patterns of ungulate distribution.

This study evaluates the influence of three factors: environment, habitat management, and season on the presence and abundance of the wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), an important prey species for Mediterranean endangered predator species. To address this issue, we estimated wild rabbit presence and abundance by latrine counting in transects located in 45 plots within a 250 × 250 m grid from June 2007 until June 2009 in a 1,200 ha hunting area in southern Portugal. We then analyzed how wild rabbit presence and abundance correlate with the aforementioned factors. Our results showed that the main variable influencing wild rabbit presence and abundance was the distance to the artificial warrens. North and northeast slope directions were negatively related to wild rabbit presence. Conversely, rabbit presence was positively correlated with short distances to ecotone, artificial warrens, and spring. Regarding rabbit abundance, in addition to artificial warrens, soft soils, bushes, and season also had a positive effect. We found that environmental variables, management practices, and season each affect wild rabbit presence and abundance differently at a home range scale in low-density population.

Nest boxes are proposed as a tool to restore habitat value but evidence of their effectiveness for arboreal mammals remains equivocal. This may arise from a poor understanding of design preferences. We conducted investigations in two landscapes in eastern Australia to determine whether species show a preference for specific designs. We observed a preference by some mammal species for particular designs (33-78% occupied/used), suggesting that design refinement can improve the frequency with which nest boxes are used. Although feral species may out-compete target species for nest boxes, we did not observe this. We recorded feral honeybees (Apis mellifera) in 6-9% of nest boxes but they did not remain, and many occupied boxes were later used by mammals. The introduced common myna bird (Acridotheres tristis) was prevalent in one landscape, but competition for nest boxes was localized. For nest boxes to be an effective habitat restoration tool, they must be able to be occupied over long periods of time. We investigated this for the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis), an arboreal marsupial threatened through part of its geographic range. Squirrel gliders occupied and bred within nest boxes (100% used) at two locations continuously over a 10-year period with minimal nest box maintenance. Individuals occupied boxes for up to 7 years.

However, their effectiveness, the role of its size, the optimal habitat management that should be promoted around them and the habitat features remains uncertain. Here, we show results from a four year study of an ambitious rabbit restocking plan on a landscape scale. We measured rabbit abundance in a vast area in which thirty-two restocking plots were built to create an initial rabbit population for further dispersion, in addition to an intensive habitat management program. We also compared rabbit abundance between managed and unmanaged UTM cells of 2.5km×2.5km. Our results showed that rabbit abundance was three times higher in managed cells, but four years after restocking, rabbit abundances had only reached the threshold needed to support stable Iberian lynx presence (at least 10 latrines per km-1) in 9 of the 23 managed cells. Rabbit abundance was strongly affected by habitat treatment and scrub coverage. The increase of shelter was useful in low cover areas but ineligible in places with high scrub cover, where the increase of refuge plus scrub clearing to create pastures improve rabbit abundance more effectively.

Arctic foxes have been fully protected in Fennoscandia following their drastic decline in the early 19th century, and their lack of recovery has been hypothesized to result from increased interspecific competition with red foxes that have colonized the arctic fox's range and/or changes in prey dynamics due to increased variation in climatic conditions. We used a large-scale spatio-temporal study combined with an extensive red fox removal intervention to test these two hypotheses by evaluating the relative importance of diverse environmental factors affecting the recolonization of arctic foxes in Northern Norway. Arctic foxes were never observed at sites where just a few daily observations of red foxes were recorded, and the probability of recolonization was zero at sites where no red fox was removed. The probability of recolonization increased when lemming abundance was very high, but the relative importance of this variable was half that of red foxes. Thus, our results lend support to both hypotheses, but they clearly highlight the presence of red foxes as the factor most limiting arctic fox recolonization in this part of its distribution. As the abundance of arctic foxes has remained extremely low even after more than 70. years of full protection, direct conservation actions seem to be needed to promote the recovery of arctic fox populations. Our research therefore highlights that conservation actions targeting a major reduction in red fox numbers are needed because the competitive interaction with red foxes is the most important factor limiting recolonization of this species. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Disentangling the importance of interspecific competition, food availability, and habitat in species occupancy: recolonization of the endangered Fennoscandian arctic fox",0

The behavioural development before release (e.g. regarding hunting skills) is particularly important for ensuring animals are self-sustaining after release. We document the rehabilitation and release of three confiscated cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) cubs and one leopard (Panthera pardus) cub, which were taken from the wild in Botswana. The animals were raised with minimal human contact and the development of their hunting skills was observed and assisted by limited pre-release training. After release, all animals were monitored and data showed they successfully hunted, with behavioural patterns similar to wild conspecifics. All established stable home ranges at the release site. Home ranges of the cheetahs ranged from 44 to 121 km2, travelling primarily during the early morning and evening, ranging from 4.5 to 9.4 km/day. While the leopard survived and probably reproduced within a stable home range (449 km2), all three cheetahs were shot within 7 months of release. Therefore, although orphaned large felids can successfully hunt after release using appropriate rehabilitation techniques, they face the same humancarnivore conflicts of their wild counterparts.

Here, we report the first successful integration of AI with frozen semen into a formal recovery program and the positive impact on genetic diversity for the critically endangered black-footed ferret Mustela nigripes. Techniques developed in the taxonomically related domestic ferret Mustela putorius furo and Siberian polecat Mustela eversmannii were applied over time to selected black-footed ferrets, including semen banking from six of the last 18 survivors. After evaluation, processing and storage in liquid nitrogen (-196°C/-321°F), for as long as 20 years, sperm samples were thawed and transabdominally inseminated into the uterine horns of female conspecifics. Eight black-footed ferret offspring were produced using thawed sperm samples (including after two decades of cryopreservation) with inseminates containing as few as 3.4×106 motile spermatozoa. The incorporation of these offspring and/or their descendants into the ex situ breeding program prevented heterozygosity loss in the population and actually enhanced gene diversity (GD) significantly by 0.2% and lowered measures of inbreeding by 5.8%.

We investigated 1) whether short fenced road sections were similarly effective in reducing large mammal-vehicle collisions as long fenced road sections (literature review), and 2) whether fence length influenced large mammal use of underpasses (two field studies). We found that: 1) short fences (=. 5 km road length) had lower (52.7%) and more variable (0-94%) effectiveness in reducing collisions than long fences (>. 5 km) (typically >. 80% reduction); 2) wildlife use of underpasses was highly variable, regardless of fence length (first field study); 3) most highway crossings occurred through isolated underpasses (82%) rather than at grade at fence ends (18%) (second field study); and 4) the proportional use of isolated underpasses (compared to crossings at fence ends) did not increase with longer fence lengths (up to 256 m from underpasses) (second field study). If the primary success parameter is to improve highway safety for humans by reducing collisions with large ungulates, the data suggest fence lengths of at least 5 km. While longer fence lengths do not necessarily guarantee higher wildlife use of underpasses as use varies greatly between locations, wildlife fencing can still improve wildlife use of an individual underpass.","Effectiveness of short sections of wildlife fencing and crossing structures along highways in reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions and providing safe crossing opportunities for large mammals",0

Transitions between these states are driven by interactions between fire and herbivory. Bush encroachment (i.e. an increase in the density of woody vegetation) is often caused by anthropogenic disturbance such as climate change, invasive plants, fire control, and livestock practices. As bush encroachment alters the dynamics between fire and herbivory, it may have significant impact on savannah ecosystems. Two of the most common measures to mitigate bush encroachment are prescribed burning and bush clearing by mechanical treatments. We studied the effects of these two mitigation measures on ungulate space use in Lapalala Wilderness, a private conservation area within the Waterberg Biosphere Reserve, northern South Africa. Burning and bush clearing affected both the overall abundance and the species composition of ungulates at particular patches, but these effects were influenced by habitat and the type of bush clearing treatment. Contrary to our expectations, most species occurred less frequently in burnt patches, and also less frequently in patches that had been bush cleared. Our results suggest that combined effects of fire and bush clearing may have positive effects on grazers and negative effects on browsers. Although our sampling design did not allow us to fully resolve interactive effects of burning and bush clearing treatments across habitats, our study highlights the fact that there are complex ecological consequences of habitat alterations in savannah ecosystems. © 2012 Society for Ecological Restoration.","Effects of prescribed burning and mechanical bush clearing on ungulate space use in an African savannah",0

Fleas are the primary vectors of plague, and flea control can stop the spread of plague epizootics and increase Utah prairie dog survival. We evaluated a newly developed grain-bait insecticide treated with the active ingredient imidacloprid. In 2009, we conducted a single application of the product in treatment plots within each of 4 study sites and sampled fleas from captured Utah prairie dogs on treatment and control plots at monthly intervals. We observed mixed results; the product generally was effective at reducing flea prevalence, abundance, and intensity on prairie dogs at some sites and not at others, and the effectiveness within a site varied over time. In 2010, we doubled the amount of bait on treatment plots, yet we still failed to observe a consistent decline in flea prevalence, abundance, and intensity on prairie dogs. At the application rates we evaluated, the imidacloprid product is likely not as effective at controlling fleas on Utah prairie dogs as the more commonly used topical insecticide containing deltamethrin. However, managers should also consider the risk of flea species developing resistance following the repeated application of a single flea-control product. Furthermore, because we observed a higher than expected diversity of flea species (8) on Utah prairie dogs, future work should be undertaken to investigate how other mammalian host species might mediate flea population dynamics, plague ecology, and the outcome of flea management approaches. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.","Mitigating plague risk in Utah prairie dogs: evaluation of a systemic flea-control product",0

We evaluated the relationship of temporal, climatic and social factors to stress hormone concentrations in five African elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations following reintroduction. We determined fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (FGMs) in 1567 fecal samples collected from elephants reintroduced to five fenced reserves with differing reintroduction histories in South Africa during 2000-2006. Variation in FGMs across the five reserves was best explained by the number of years that elapsed since initial release. Compared with FGMs 1 year after release, FGMs were 10% lower 10 years after release and 40% lower 24 years after release. Across all reserves, FGMs were consistently highest in the dry season, although daily and monthly temperature and rainfall were not as important as other factors. FGMs did not vary solely in relationship to reserve size or elephant density. Our findings suggest that regardless of reintroduction site conditions, elephants and likely other species subject to reintroduction require an extended period of time to physiologically acclimatize to their new surroundings.

Conflict between large carnivores and livestock outside the boundaries of wildlife areas frequently results in losses to both livestock and predator populations. The endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus Temminck, 1820) is wide ranging and unrestricted by conventional fences, thereby posing a major challenge to conservation managers. Wild dogs are territorial and communicate residence using scent marks. Simulating the presence of other wild dogs using translocated foreign scent marks may therefore represent a means to manage wild dog ranging behaviour. Aims. To investigate the effectiveness of using targeted scent-mark deployments to signal a wild dog pack to return to their frequented range within the safety of a protected area. Methods. We report on the ranging behaviour of a wild dog pack reintroduced into a wildlife area in Botswana with no recent history of resident wild dogs. We describe daily movements by the free-ranging introduced pack and compare these to moves following targeted deployment of scent marks when the wild dog pack had ranged close to or outside the boundaries of the protected area. Key results. Targeted foreign scent-mark exposure resulted in the pack moving closer to the geometric centre of its range. The mean distance travelled the day after exposure was significantly greater than the distance travelled the previous day and the mean daily distance moved during the study period. Conclusions. Targeted exposure to foreign scent marks proved to be a viable alternative to recapturing dogs that had ranged beyond the boundaries of the wildlife area. Implications. This novel approach to managing free-ranging carnivores utilises biologically relevant signals and holds potential not only for the conservation of African wild dogs, but also for other territorial species. © CSIRO 2012.","Managing the ranging behaviour of African wild dogs (<i>Lycaon pictus</i>) using translocated scent marks",0

This type of data and analysis is needed to monitor and evaluate enforcement effectiveness and develop adaptive management strategies. At KYNP, we used camera-trapping data as a proxy to evaluate whether or not a positive impact of ranger stations on wildlife distribution could outweigh edge effects from human disturbance. We assessed factors affecting the distribution of poachers and wildlife using Maxent. Our analysis was based on 217 camera trap locations (6260 trap nights) and suggests that ungulates and poachers persist nearby ranger stations.

Home ranges were 902,107 ha and averaged 460 ha. Using a mixed linear model, I estimated that home-range size decreased with increasing 1) red deer density, 2) supplemental feeding intensity, and 3) average annual temperature; 4) home-range size increased as the distance of main roads from the edge of the home range increased; and 5) males had a larger home range than females (580 ha versus 400 ha). These results were explained by effects of food availability (1, 2, and 3), energy expenditure of an individual (4 and 5), intraspecific interactions (1 and 5), and size of unfragmented habitat patches (4) on home-range size. To my knowledge, this is the 1st large mammal study to explicitly show that the density and spatial distribution of roads and supplemental feeding affect home-range size of red deer and that humans can have a greater impact on home-range size and shape than natural habitat factors. Ungulates are often supplementally fed to increase their value to hunters and to reduce forest damage, particularly in Europe; however, this practice can greatly reduce the home-range size, potentially leading to increased disease transmission and competition associated with the higher deer densities around feeding sites, which can result in just the opposite of what was intended. © 2012 American Society of Mammalogists.","Roads and supplemental feeding affect home-range size of Slovenian red deer more than natural factors",0

We evaluated the effectiveness of a law enforcement strategy to recover tigers and their prey in Lao PDR where extensive habitat provided favorable conditions for large increases in tiger numbers if protected from poaching. Over a seven-year period, we monitored along a theory of change to evaluate assumptions about the causal linkages between intermediate results and biological outcomes.

We conclude that actions were sufficient to reduce poaching and increase prey populations, but insufficient to curtail extirpation of tigers. Recovering small populations of high-value wildlife such as tigers in promising source sites is dependent on establishing a complete enforcement regime, complimentary strategies that build support for the enforcement regime, and a nimble monitoring and evaluation system for agile adaptive management.","To protect or neglect?

The spatial distribution of forage resources, which migration exploits, often are altered and may have subtle, unintended consequences. Supplemental feeding is a common management practice, particularly for ungulates in North America and Europe, and carryover effects on behavior of this anthropogenic manipulation of forage are expected in theory, but have received limited empirical evaluation, particularly regarding effects on migration. We used global positioning system (GPS) data to evaluate the influence of winter feeding on migration behavior of 219 adult female elk (Cervus elaphus) from 18 fed ranges and 4 unfed ranges in western Wyoming. Principal component analysis revealed that the migratory behavior of fed and unfed elk differed in distance migrated, and the timing of arrival to, duration on, and departure from summer range. Fed elk migrated 19.2 km less, spent 11 more days on stopover sites, arrived to summer range 5 days later, resided on summer range 26 fewer days, and departed in the autumn 10 days earlier than unfed elk. Time-to-event models indicated that differences in migratory behavior between fed and unfed elk were caused by altered sensitivity to the environmental drivers of migration. In spring, unfed elk migrated following plant green-up closely, whereas fed elk departed the feedground but lingered on transitional range, thereby delaying their arrival to summer range. In autumn, fed elk were more responsive to low temperatures and precipitation events, causing earlier departure from summer range than unfed elk. Overall, supplemental feeding disconnected migration by fed elk from spring green-up and decreased time spent on summer range, thereby reducing access to quality forage. Our findings suggest that ungulate migration can be substantially altered by changes to the spatial distribution of resources, including those of anthropogenic origin, and that management practices applied in one season may have unintended behavioral consequences in subsequent seasons.","Supplemental feeding alters migration of a temperate ungulate",0

Our objective was to quantify the effects of predator treatments on moose population dynamics by investigating changes in survival while evaluating the contribution of potentially confounding covariates. In May 2003 and 2004, we reduced black bear (Ursus americanus) and brown bear (U. arctos) numbers by translocating bears =240 km from the study area. Aircraft-assisted take reduced wolf (Canis lupus) numbers markedly in the study area during 2004-2007. We estimated black bears were reduced by approximately 96% by June 2004 and recovered to within 27% of untreated numbers by May 2007. Brown bears were reduced approximately 50% by June 2004. Late-winter wolf numbers were reduced by 75% by 2005 and likely remained at these levels through 2007. In addition to predator treatments, moose hunting closures during 2004-2007 reduced harvests of male moose by 60% in the study area. Predator treatments resulted in increased calf survival rates during summer (primarily from reduced black bear predation) and autumn (primarily from reduced wolf predation). Predator treatments had little influence on survival of moose calves during winter; instead, calf survival was influenced by snow depth and possibly temperature. Increased survival of moose calves during summer and autumn combined with relatively constant winter survival in most years led to a corresponding increase in annual survival of calves following predator treatments. Nonpredation mortalities of calves increased following predator treatments; however, this increase provided little compensation to the decrease in predation mortalities resulting from treatments. Thus, predator-induced calf mortality was primarily additive. Summer survival of moose calves was positively related to calf mass (ß > 0.07, SE = 0.073) during treated years and lower (ß = -0.82, SE = 0.247) for twins than singletons during all years. Following predator treatments, survival of yearling moose increased 8.7% for females and 21.4% for males during summer and 2.2% for females and 15.6% for males during autumn. Annual survival of adult (=2 yr old) female moose also increased in treated years and was negatively (ß = -0.21, SE = 0.078) related to age. Moose density increased 45%, from 0.38 moose/km2 in 2001 to 0.55 moose/km2 in 2007, which resulted from annual increases in overall survival of moose, not increases in reproductive rates. Indices of nutritional status remained constant throughout our study despite increased moose density.

This low recruitment combined with liberal antlerless deer harvest has resulted in declines in some deer populations, and consequently, increased interest in coyote population control. We investigated whether neonate survival increased after coyote removal, whether coyote predation on neonates was additive to other mortality sources, and whether understory vegetation density affected neonate survival. We monitored neonate survival for 4 years prior to (2006-2009) and 3 years during (2010-2012) intensive coyote removal on 3 32-km2 units on the United States Department of Energy's Savannah River Site, South Carolina. We removed 474 coyotes (1.63 coyotes/km2 per unit per year), reducing coyote abundance by 78% from pre-removal levels. The best model (wi = 0.927) describing survival probability among 216 radio-collared neonates included a within-year quadratic time trend variable, date of birth, removal treatment, and a varying removal year effect. Under this model, survival differed between pre-treatment and removal periods and it differed among years during the removal period, being >100% greater than pre-treatment survival (0.228) during the first removal year (0.513), similar to pre-treatment survival during the second removal year (0.202), and intermediate during the third removal year (0.431). Despite an initial increase, the overall effect of coyote removal on neonate survival was modest. Mortality rate attributable to coyote predation was lowest during the first removal year (0.357) when survival was greatest, but the mortality rate from all other causes did not differ between the pre-treatment period and any year during removals, indicating that coyote predation acted as an additive source of mortality. Survival probability was not related to vegetation cover, either directly or in interaction with coyote abundance. When the objective is to increase the recruitment of white-tailed deer, we conclude that neither coyote control nor vegetation management appear effective.

Mortality rates after restocking were higher than for reintroductions (13·4 cf. 7·9%, respectively) due largely to intraspecific fighting. No predictors strongly influenced reintroduction success, although cohorts consisting entirely of adult males were 8·2% of individuals but contributed 21·9% of deaths, and reserves with lowest carrying capacities (i.e. <0·1rhinokm-2) had a 16·3% mortality rate. Most models for restocking success were not supported. Only those including age class received substantial support. Age was the only predictor to strongly influence death rates. Predictors previously thought influential, like population density, reserve area and quality, and cohort size, were not supported. 4. Synthesis and applications. Simple rules succeeded where complex ecological and demographic hypotheses failed to predict survival after translocation of critically endangered black rhinoceros. Results support bold attempts by managers at translocations towards species recovery in most ways that they have historically occurred. Groups of rhinoceros of different size and composition can be successfully moved over large distances between different ecological contexts. Also, the release of cohorts into reserves that are relatively small, poorer habitat or already stocked need not be avoided so long as calves and all-male cohorts are not reintroduced, and only adults used for restocking. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of information-theoretic comparisons of a priori hierarchical models to test hypotheses for conservation management. We caution against interpreting simple correlations or regression amongst a large number of nested ecological and demographic variables. © 2011 The Authors.

Starting in 1985, individuals were brought from western zoos to two centers in China and breeding programs were initiated. With the increasing size of captive populations, two reintroduction projects were launched in the northwestern China in 2001 and 2010. Knowledge on genetic diversity in China's horse populations is limited, but would help improve the genetic management and assess the success of the reintroduction. Accordingly, one reintroduced and two captive populations were examined with 10 microsatellite loci together with pedigree data. The results showed higher level of diversity within the captive populations than the reintroduced population, indicating some alleles may have been lost during reintroduction. Genetic differentiation was detected among populations (FST=0.09±0.05, RhoST=0.05±0.02) and Bayesian clustering supported the presence of three subpopulations. The highest genetic differentiation was observed between the captive and reintroduced populations, and inbreeding coefficients were generally higher in the reintroduced population. Temporal estimates of both pedigree and microsatellite data showed a high, but decreasing level inbreeding. Through simulations, we estimated that the reintroduced population needs more than 100 individuals to retain approximately 90% of its current, already depauperate, genetic diversity.

This approach was used to obtain the best results using the minimum possible number of animals. Three aoudad females were synchronized using a domestic sheep protocol and subcutaneous osmotic pumps for the delivery of follicle-stimulating hormone. A mini-surgical approach combined with laparoscopy was performed to obtain in vivo-produced embryos. All females had an ovulatory response of more than three corporea lutea, but only five good quality morulae were obtained from one female. Those were cryopreserved by vitrification using a Cryotop®. In conclusion, our approach was successful in obtaining in vivo embryos using a limited number of females.

In human-altered landscapes, we may expect that reintroduced species affect taxa already present. In Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise National Park (central Apennines, Italy), a 30% decline in the abundance of 'vulnerable' Apennine chamois (2005: c. 650 individuals, 2010: c. 450 individuals) has been recorded, whereas red deer (reintroduced in 1972-1987: 81 individuals) have greatly increased (2010: >2500 individuals). We investigated space and diet overlaps between red deer and Apennine chamois, and their effects on foraging behaviour of the latter. We also compared the composition of grasslands with that recorded when the former were absent. In 2010-2011, we found out: (1) a great space (>75%) and diet (>90%) overlap between deer and chamois; (2) a significant increase of unpalatable plant species and a decreasing trend of the nutritious, most grazed species by chamois, in respect to when deer were absent; (3) irrespective from vegetation type, a significantly reduced bite rate of adult female chamois in patches used also by deer, compared with areas without deer. Our results suggest a negative effect of red deer on the availability of nutritious plant species in summer-autumn, possibly because of grazing and physical damage on the grassland caused by trampling. Environmental conditions and access to high-quality forage in the warm season influence the winter survival of offspring of mountain ungulates. Our results indicate that interspecific overlap in resource use with an increasing, reintroduced population can threaten rare taxa.

Attempts to measure the impact of commercial thinning on northern flying squirrels have mostly addressed short-term effects (2-5. years post-thinning) and the few published studies of longer-term results have been contradictory. We measured densities of northern flying squirrels 11-13. years after thinning of young (55-65. years) Douglas-fir forest stands in the Cascade Range of Oregon, as part of the Young Stand Thinning & Diversity Study. The study includes four replicate blocks, each consisting of an unthinned control stand and one stand each of the following thinning treatments: Heavy Thin; Light Thin; and Light Thin with Gaps. Thinning decreased density of northern flying squirrels, and squirrel densities were significantly lower in heavily thinned stands than in more lightly thinned stands. Regression analysis revealed a strong positive relationship of flying squirrel density with density of large (>30. cm diameter) standing dead trees and a negative relationship with percent cover of low understory shrubs.

Establishment and fencing of protected areas to isolate biodiversity from human activities is one of the most popular methods for achieving this protection. Here we analyze two long-term (~50. years) datasets on a diverse mammal community of 38 regularly occurring species including many of international conservation importance such as the rare, endemic mountain bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci), the black rhino (Diceros bicornis), the elephant (Loxodonta africana), and the lion (Panthera leo). These data were collected in two different locations within a flagship protected area in East Africa. Our primary objective was to investigate patterns of wildlife populations and diversity before and after the installation of a perimeter electric fence. We find strong evidence for long-term human-induced edge effects at the site that is closest to the border of the protected area (Treetops); this site registered the strongest losses in total wildlife population numbers, aggregate wildlife biomass, and species richness. In contrast, wildlife populations at the site farther away from the edge of the protected area (The Ark) have remained relatively stable over the duration of the dataset. Our data reveal clear differentiation in the temporal changes of wildlife populations between the two sites. Establishment of the fence in 1989 led to temporary increases in wildlife populations near the park margins, but since the late 1990s these gains have been reversed and wildlife populations have continued to decline near the edge of the reserve.

We collected primary data on 12 European ground squirrel reintroduction projects carried out at 14 localities in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland since 1989. We focused on seven methodological aspects of each reintroduction: selection of release site, method of releasing, date of releasing, origin of released animals, total number of released animals, mean number of released animals per season and reintroduction site management. The method of releasing was found to be the key factor in determining the settlement of animals at the target locality. Only soft releasing methods, i. e. the use of enclosures and/or artificial burrows, ensure that animals remain at the target locality. The other factors significantly determining reintroduction success are the number of released animals per season (at least 23 animals required) and the total number of released animals (a minimum of 60 individuals). Long-term management of the site and regular monitoring of the newly established population are necessary.

Accordingly, declines in the endangered Key Largo woodrat Neotoma floridana smalli (KLWR) population have been attributed to predation by feral cats Felis catus, Burmese pythons Python molurus bivittatus and raccoons Procyon lotor. We estimated survival, recruitment and realized population growth rates from four capture-mark-recapture studies to determine if the pattern of demographic variation was consistent with predation as the primary cause of KLWR declines. Additionally, we evaluated the KLWR captive-breeding and release program by comparing survival of captive-born and released KLWRs to wild-born KLWRs. The realized population growth rate of wild-born KLWRs had a strong pattern of covariation with recruitment; covariation between the realized population growth rate and apparent survival was negligible. Consistent with demographic theory, our results suggest that KLWR population dynamics were driven primarily by variation in recruitment, and that periodic reductions in recruitment led to population declines. We found that the survival curve and the first month (S1) and first 3-month (S1-3) survival estimates for the wild-born KLWRs [S1 = 0.929 (0.890-0.968); S1-3 = 0.942 (0.919-0.965)] were considerably higher (<U+03C7>2 = 33.9, 1 d.f., P < 0.001) than released KLWRs [S1 = 0.521 (0.442-0.600); S1-3 = 0.561 (0.493-0.629)].

Historically, the ecosystem engineer California ground squirrel Otospermophilus beecheyi supported a grassland food web through widespread burrowing activity. Currently, ground squirrels are not a threatened species, but like many other ecosystem engineers, they exist at densities too low to fulfill their engineering role in many locations. Our objective was to implement short-term treatments, including squirrel translocation, to re-establish key ecological processes on protected reserve lands. We manipulated vegetation and squirrels in a replicated, large-scale field experiment for 2 years, and monitored through a third year. Vegetation mowing and soil decompaction treatments reduced grass density and thatch depth. Squirrel translocation accelerated squirrel settlement and activity in target sites. Of the more than 1000 burrow entrances remaining through the third year, nearly all burrows were concentrated in the plots that received squirrel translocation. We found significant additive effects of squirrel translocation and vegetation management on the spatial footprint of squirrel activity. Noteworthy and persistent engineering effects were achieved through squirrel activity, and both vegetation management and squirrel re-establishment were needed to stimulate squirrel activity. The overarching goal of this experiment was to provide conservation managers with a cost-effective tool for restoring degraded habitats to a hybrid ecosystem state with improved suitability for species of conservation concern, in this case, the western burrowing owl Athene cunicularia hypugaea.","Experimental habitat restoration for conserved species using ecosystem engineers and vegetation management",0

However, restorations are often limited in space or time, and we know little on whether and how restoration and management affect vertebrates. Here we assessed the local and landscape-scale effects of habitat restoration and management on small-mammal communities in the Egyek-Pusztakócs marsh system (Hortobágy National Park, Hungary), site of the largest active restoration of grasslands on former croplands in Europe. We live-trapped mice, voles and shrews in spring and autumn in 2 years (four sampling periods) at two sites in six habitat types: croplands, grasslands restored 3-6 years earlier and natural grasslands. Data on 421 individuals of 12 species showed that restored grasslands were similar to croplands and natural grasslands in species richness, abundance and composition. At the local scale, management influenced abundance because there were more small mammals in unmanaged and early-mown grasslands with taller vegetation than in late-mown or grazed grasslands with lower vegetation, or in ploughed croplands. Elevation was also important because sites at higher elevation provided refuges during spring floods or summer droughts. At the landscape scale, the proportion of restored and natural grasslands positively affected the abundance of small mammals, whereas the proportion of linear habitats (roads, canals) had a negative effect on abundance. Our results show that management is more important than restoration per se at the local scale, which is expected for habitat generalists such as small mammals in contrast to specialists such as plant-feeding invertebrates. However, restoration provides landscape-scale benefits by increasing the area of grasslands that can serve as refuges for small mammals in unfavourable periods. We thus conclude that a mosaic of restored and appropriately managed grasslands with tall vegetation will provide the best chances for the persistence of small-mammal communities in dynamic landscapes.","Local habitat management and landscape-scale restoration influence small-mammal communities in grasslands",0

We also examined whether any potential unintended consequences of feeding occur and under what conditions. We found clear evidence that supplementary feeding enhanced reproduction and population growth under certain conditions. By contrast, we found limited evidence of the effectiveness of diversionary feeding to protect crops, forestry, and natural habitats, with positive effects often undermined by increases in ungulate density. However, the use of diversionary feeding to reduce traffic collisions seems promising but requires further investigation. The unintended effects of feeding are typically complex, involving changes to demography, behavior, and vegetation with consequent cascading effects on other trophic levels, as well as exacerbated risks of disease transmission. Increased ungulate density is the primary driver behind these unintended effects, the consequences of which tend to increase with longevity of feeding and affect a range of stakeholders. We urge managers to take seriously the risks as well as the economic and ethical issues before deciding to feed ungulates.","To feed or not to feed?

These criteria included continued survival after 8. years, increased distribution across the large Reserve and, most importantly, recovery after a drought event.

Outside the Reserve, where cats and foxes were present but controlled through poison baiting, reintroduction attempts of the greater bilby and burrowing bettong were unsuccessful.

Using camera-traps, we identified 6 individual leopards and used spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods, incorporating humans and prey as covariates, to test for factors affecting the detection probability of leopards before and after the park closure. Leopard density was unchanged between the two periods, however the movement and activity patterns were clearly different. In the absence of tourist activity, leopards tended to move more frequently, leopard detection rates increased by 70% and activity shifted towards being more diurnal. The consequences of these changes in behaviour may include improved health, reproduction and survival. A management strategy involving seasonal closure of parks may serve to alleviate pressure on leopards and other carnivores. We recommend using information on abundance of large carnivores and their prey species, and human disturbance as the key indicators for long-term monitoring and management of protected areas in Southeast Asia.","Effects of temporary closure of a national park on leopard movement and behaviour in tropical Asia",0

The area of permanent occurrence increased from 600 to 10,900 km2, with an average density of 1.3 wolves/100 km2. The nearest neighbour distance between wolf territories decreased from 260 to 25 km. In 2001–2005, half of the settlement efforts by wolves failed after 1–2 years whereas in 2006–2009 only one fifth of newly settled wolves failed to persist >2 years. The number of wolves in groups varied from 2 to 9, and the mean group size increased from 1.8 in 2001 to 4.8 in 2012. The survival of pups from May to the end of November was 50 % (the mean number of pups per litter was 5.1 and 2.5, respectively). Of 28 wolves found dead, 65 % were killed by vehicles, 25 % were poached, and 7 % died because of diseases and natural factors. All road casualties were young wolves, most of them male (67 %), hit on roads on average 11.6 km from the centre of the nearest pack. The re-colonisation of WPL started from jump dispersal, which allowed wolves to establish packs in distant locations. As the recovery proceeded, the dispersal pattern shifted to being stratified, a mixture of diffusion and jump dispersal that resulted in the creation of packs in close vicinity to existing groups. After 12 years of re-colonisation, wolves in Western Poland occupied about 30 % of potential suitable habitats.","Wolf recovery and population dynamics in Western Poland, 2001-2012",0

We assessed the genetic diversity of animals translocated to each site and their wild-born progeny, and whether wild-born animals showed evidence of genetic bottlenecks or genetic drift from the source population. Encouragingly, we found no significant loss of genetic diversity in any of the wild-born populations compared to the source population and no significant increase in inbreeding or relatedness amongst wild-born individuals compared to founder populations two years post-translocation. However, we detected an approximately 10-fold reduction in effective population size between founding and wild-born populations. We found no apparent differentiation between wild-born populations and the original source population, or between wild-born animals and their respective founders. Population viability modeling predicts that each of the translocated populations is susceptible to loss of genetic diversity over time.

Storage of BCG-containing baits at 4 °C showed a slight decrease in colony-forming units (CFUs) by day 31. In contrast, storage at -20 or -80 °C over the same 31-day period showed no significant decrease in BCG viability.

Arid Australia has the world's worst modern mammalian extinction record, largely attributable to competition from introduced herbivores, particularly European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and predation by feral cats (Felis catus) and foxes (Vulpes vulpes). The biological control agent rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) was introduced to Australia in 1995 and resulted in dramatic, widespread rabbit suppression. We compared the area of occupancy and extent of occurrence of 4 extant species of small mammals before and after RHDV outbreak, relative to rainfall, sampling effort, and rabbit and predator populations. Despite low rainfall during the first 14 years after RHDV, 2 native rodents listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the dusky hopping-mouse (Notomys fuscus) and plains mouse (Pseudomys australis), increased their extent of occurrence by 241-365%. A threatened marsupial micropredator, the crest-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda), underwent a 70-fold increase in extent of occurrence and a 20-fold increase in area of occupancy. Both bottom-up and top-down trophic effects were attributed to RHDV, namely decreased competition for food resources and declines in rabbit-dependent predators. Based on these sustained increases, these 3 previously threatened species now qualify for threat-category downgrading on the IUCN Red List. These recoveries are on a scale rarely documented in mammals and give impetus to programs aimed at targeted use of RHDV in Australia, rather than simply employing top-down threat-based management of arid ecosystems. Conservation programs that take big-picture approaches to addressing threatening processes over large spatial scales should be prioritized to maximize return from scarce conservation funding. Further, these should be coupled with long-term ecological monitoring, a critical tool in detecting and understanding complex ecosystem change.","Rabbit biocontrol and landscape-scale recovery of threatened desert mammals",0

Capture of nontarget species is an inherent side-effect of trapping animals that is inefficient and potentially detrimental to individuals and populations. Reducing recapture of nontarget species will increase the efficiency of long-term studies and projects, and minimize unwanted impacts. 2. During the initial stages of a 3-year feral cat Felis catus control programme on San Clemente Island, California, USA, we experienced high recapture rates of nontarget endangered San Clemente Island foxes Urocyon littoralis clementae, impacting project efficiency and potentially foxes. 3. We investigated whether we could modify our baiting strategy to reduce fox recaptures using behavioural modification techniques, while simultaneously maintaining the ability to capture feral cats. We tested two strategies, aversive conditioning and reward removal, to reduce fox recapture rates. 4. Using lithium chloride (LC) as an aversive agent, we reduced fox recapture rates more than 10 times compared with rates using control bait. Using the reward removal technique, we reduced fox recapture rates almost 20 times compared with control baits. Neither behavioural modification technique deterred cats from entering traps, and our results suggest that by reducing fox recaptures, we improved our ability to capture cats. 5.

We investigated whether landscape features could be used to model predation risk from coyotes (Canis latrans) and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) on the endangered black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes). We used location data of reintroduced ferrets from 3 sites in South Dakota to determine whether exposure to landscape features typically associated with predators affected survival of ferrets, and whether ferrets considered predation risk when choosing habitat near perches potentially used by owls or near linear features predicted to be used by coyotes. Exposure to areas near likely owl perches reduced ferret survival, but landscape features potentially associated with coyote movements had no appreciable effect on survival. Ferrets were located within 90 m of perches more than expected in 2 study sites that also had higher ferret mortality due to owl predation. Densities of potential coyote travel routes near ferret locations were no different than expected in all 3 sites. Repatriated ferrets might have selected resources based on factors other than predator avoidance.

During 2009-2010 we interviewed 53 commercial and 20 subsistence Namibian farmers that are using 83 such dogs. Fewer commercial and subsistence farmers reported livestock losses to predators during the most recent year of guarding-dog use compared to the year before dogs were introduced.

All farmers ceased killing cheetah Acinonyx jubatus and leopard Panthera pardus during this year, and one dog killed a single cheetah. Conversely, dogs and farmers killed more black-backed jackals Canis mesomelas between them in the survey year than the farmers reported killing in the year before acquiring dogs. Two of the dogs reportedly killed non-target carnivore species, and 15 killed prey species. Thus our results challenge the categorization of livestock guarding dogs as a non-lethal conflict mitigation method. We suggest that the conservation status and body size of wild carnivores relative to the size of the guarding dogs be considered before introducing dogs to protect livestock. Additionally, corrective training for dogs that chase or kill non-target species should be implemented, especially where farmers value these species or where non-target species are threatened.","More bark than bite?

We systematically evaluated these factors to assist development of locally appropriate strategies to mitigate disease risk. Wild dogs from 16 sites representing five unconnected populations were examined for rabies virus, canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and Babesia spp. exposure. Analyses revealed widespread exposure to viral pathogens, but Babesia was never detected. Exposure to CDV was associated with unprotected and protected-unfenced areas where wild dogs likely have a high probability of domestic dog contact and, in the case of protected-unfenced areas, likely reside amongst high wildlife densities. Our findings also suggest that domestic dog contact may increase rabies and coronavirus exposure risk. Therefore, domestic dogs may be a source of CDV, rabies and coronavirus, while wildlife may also play an important role in CDV transmission dynamics. Relatively high parvovirus seroprevalence across land-use types suggests that it might persist in the absence of spillover from domestic dogs. Should intervention be needed to control pathogens in wild dogs, efforts to prevent rabies and coronavirus exposure might be directed at reducing infection in the presumed domestic dog reservoir through vaccination. If prevention of CDV and parvovirus infections were deemed a management necessity, control of disease in domestic dogs may be insufficient to reduce transmission risks, and vaccination of wild dogs themselves may be the optimal strategy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","The effect of protected areas on pathogen exposure in endangered African wild dog (<i>Lycaon pictus</i>) populations",0

Such evidence is needed to justify the use of lethal methods in conservation policy. During 2006-2010 we removed mink from the River Monnow Catchment in western Britain, using track-recording rafts to monitor continuously for mink presence, guiding a strategic trapping effort. The area monitored and trapped was increased in stages, from a core sub-catchment with 109 km of water-course in 2006, to a 421-km2 catchment with 203 km of water-course in 2009. In each successive sub-catchment, mink detection and capture rates declined rapidly to near-zero levels after trapping began. Detections and captures showed seasonal peaks in every year corresponding to known dispersal periods, but also declined steadily from year to year, with increasing periods in which we did not detect mink. These results suggested that each sub-catchment was cleared of mink within a few months, with subsequent captures attributable to immigration. On average, we detected each mink 5.1 times before capture (daily probability of detection = 0.059 per mink and raft), and trapped them 3.4 days after deploying traps in response. On average, mink entering the area were likely to have been present for less than 13 days before capture. Water voles had been extinct in the Monnow Catchment since the 1980s.

Damage, mitigation measures and public opinion were assessed using compensation records, analysis of farm conditions, questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews, diet analysis and on-farm trials of livestock-guarding dogs. Economic damage was inconsequential on a national scale but high locally: c. 80% of reported losses occurred at 12% of sheep flocks. Grey wolves Canis lupus were held responsible for four to six times more damage than brown bears Ursus arctos, although livestock occurred in only 2 of 78 wolf faeces during spring-autumn, when sheep and cattle were most vulnerable. Losses to Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx were negligible. Compared to other sectors of society shepherds had the most negative attitudes, particularly towards wolves, despite compensation payments. Appropriate use of livestock-guarding dogs was associated with fewer losses: median loss at trial flocks with predation was 70% lower than at control flocks. We conclude that identifying vulnerable farms and targeting them for mitigation could reduce damage, although lack of motivation and awareness are obstacles. This study shows that damage levels need not be excessive despite high predator densities in human-dominated landscapes. Conflicts were unevenly distributed, with much of the variation explained by local conditions and husbandry practices, especially preventive measures.

To investigate the status of this cascade, in September of 2010 we repeated an earlier survey of aspen and measured browsing and heights of young aspen in 97 stands along four streams in the Lamar River catchment of the park's northern winter range. We found that browsing on the five tallest young aspen in each stand decreased from 100% of all measured leaders in 1998 to means of <25% in the uplands and <20% in riparian areas by 2010. Correspondingly, aspen recruitment (i.e., growth of seedlings/sprouts above the browse level of ungulates) increased as browsing decreased over time in these same stands. We repeated earlier inventories of cottonwoods and found that recruitment had also increased in recent years.

After wolf reintroduction, elk populations decreased, but both beaver (Caster canadensis) and bison (Bison bison) numbers increased, possibly due to the increase in available woody plants and herbaceous forage resulting from less competition with elk. Trophic cascades research during the first 15. years after wolf reintroduction indicated substantial initial effects on both plants and animals, but northern Yellowstone still appears to be in the early stages of ecosystem recovery. In ecosystems where wolves have been displaced or locally extirpated, their reintroduction may represent a particularly effective approach for passive restoration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Trophic cascades in Yellowstone: the first 15 years after wolf reintroduction",0

Potorous tridactylus) and southern brown bandicoot (. Isoodon obesulus)-in south-east Australian forests. We hypothesized that sustained and spatially extensive fox control would reduce fox abundance and increase occupancy, colonization and persistence rates for all three prey species in three treatment areas relative to three non-treatment areas. There was a substantial decline in bait take by foxes in treatment areas from 2005 to 2013, and fox abundances were much lower in treatment than non-treatment areas throughout the experiment. Occupancy rates of all three native prey species increased in treatment areas relative to non-treatment areas, although the magnitude of the increase varied with species, treatment area, and time. Colonization and persistence rates were not always positive for all species and all treatment areas. Our experiment demonstrates that foxes can be reduced to, and maintained at, low abundances and that this has a generally positive effect on the occupancy by small native mammalian prey species.","Long-term and large-scale control of the introduced red fox increases native mammal occupancy in Australian forests",0

The value of captive breeding for recovery programs of endangered carnivorous mammals is often questioned because of low post-release survival reported for founder animals following translocation. Aims. The aim of the present study was to test the effect of rearing method on survival and body mass of captive-raised Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) following release on an offshore island. We also compared the post-release diet of these devils with the diet of wild devils on mainland Tasmania, where a similar array of diet items is available. Methods. Twenty-eight captive-raised devils were released onto the island; 19 had been raised in intensive captivemanagement facilities (IC) and nine in free-range (22 ha) enclosures (FRE). Survival and body-mass change were compared between IC and FRE for up to 440 days post-release. Devil diet was assessed via scat analysis. Key results. A high proportion (96%) of the founders survived 1 year post-release. Pre-release captive-rearing method had no effect. Released devils gained an average of 14% of their original body mass, irrespective of captive-rearing method. There was very little difference in the diet of captive-reared devils released onto Maria Island relative to wild mainland devils: Tasmanian pademelon, Thylogale billardierii, was the primary food item for both. Conclusions. The intensity of captive rearing did not affect the survival of devils released onto Maria Island. This suggests that even devils held in IC facilities retain the innate behaviour required to scavenge and hunt prey, and therefore maintain bodyweight post-release. The lack of any threatening processes on the island is also likely to have contributed to the high survival rate 2 years post-release. Implications. Our study provided preliminary evidence that the release of captive-raised Tasmanian devils onto off-shore islands is a viable conservation action. Captive-breeding programs and captive-raised founders can play a viable and valuable role in the conservation action plans for recovery programs of endangered carnivorous mammals.","Sympathy for the devil: captive-management style did not influence survival, body-mass change or diet of Tasmanian devils 1 year after wild release",0

Nowadays, Mediterranean landscapes suffer from wildfires that affect extensive areas and produce considerable habitat changes. However, little is known about the influence of wildfires and post-fire treatments on rabbit abundance to address policies to recover their populations. To do so, we studied abundances of this species in four types of plots during three consecutive years after a wildfire in Catalonia (NE Spain): (A) unburnt forests, (B) burnt forests with removal of burnt trees but with branches left, (C) burnt forests with removal of burnt trees and branches, and (D) non-forested burnt plots. Rabbits progressively colonised burnt plots, where their abundance increased for at least 5 years after the fire, but decreased or even disappeared in unburnt ones, indicating that forest fires have a positive effect on rabbit populations. Although abundances did not differ between the three burnt plot types, plots with removal of burnt branches had the highest increase in abundance. In addition, soil covered by branches or by dense vegetation appeared negatively correlated with abundance, indicating that this could hinder rabbit movements, while some plant species could benefit rabbits by providing high quality food. Thus, post-fire treatments favourable to rabbit populations might therefore be a good way of increasing the conservation and economic value of areas affected by forest fires. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Effects of wildfires and post-fire forest treatments on rabbit abundance",0

Only a small population of swift foxes near Ardmore, which is located in Fall River County, South Dakota, persisted. In 2003, a reintroduction program was initiated at BNP with swift foxes translocated from Colorado and Wyoming.

However, the ability of crossing structures to allow individual and population-level movements across road networks remains unknown. In April 2006, we initiated a 3-year investigation into whether crossing structures provide demographic connectivity for grizzly and black bears in Banff National Park. We collected hair with multiple noninvasive methods to obtain genetic samples from grizzly and black bears around the Bow Valley. Our objectives were to determine the number of male and female grizzly and black bears that use crossing structures; examine spatial and temporal patterns of crossings; and estimate the proportions of grizzly and black bear populations in the Bow Valley that use crossing structures. Fifteen grizzly (7 female, 8 male) and 17 black bears (8 female, 9 male) used wildlife crossing structures. The number of individuals detected at wildlife crossing structures was highly correlated with the number of passages in space and time. Grizzly bears used open crossing structures (e.g., overpasses) more often than constricted crossings (e.g., culverts). Peak use of crossing structures for both bear species occurred in July, when high rates of foraging activity coincide with mating season. We compared the number of bears that used crossings with estimates of population abundance from a related study and determined that substantial percentages of grizzly (15.0% in 2006, 19.8% in 2008) and black bear (17.6% in 2006, 11.0% in 2008) populations used crossing structures.

In an effort to reduce deer-vehicle collisions (DVC) and maintain migratory connectivity, the Wyoming Department of Transportation installed 7 concrete box-culvert underpasses with continuous game-proof fencing between each crossing structure. To evaluate the effectiveness of this mitigation project, we used remote cameras to quantify the number of mule deer that used the underpasses, estimate passage rates through time, and compare rates of DVCs before and after underpass construction. Through 3 years of monitoring (which encompassed autumn migration [2008, 2009, and 2010], winter use, and spring migration [2009, 2010, and 2011] for 3 migration cycles), we documented 49,146 mule deer move through the underpasses. Passage rates of deer approaching underpasses steadily increased from 54% in Year 1 to 92% in Year 3. Peak movements during the autumn migration occurred in mid-December, while peak spring movements were in mid-March and early May. Underpass and fence installation effectively reduced DVCs by 81%. Had fence gates remained closed and cattle guards clear of snow, DVCs could be eliminated altogether.

This study aimed at evaluating the method to cross-foster wolf pups from zoo-born to zoo-born litters.

After augmentation, all four females accepted the foster pups, demonstrated by her moving the entire litter to a new den site. Growth rate was dependent on the age difference of the pups in the foster litters, with a considerably slower growth rate in the 8 days younger pups. However, these pups later appeared to be at no disadvantage. Foster pups had a higher survival rate than females' pups, however, the causes of death were probably not kin or non-kin related.

We hypothesized a progressive adaptation of the translocated individuals, highlighted by a gradual decrease in the dissimilarities between translocated and resident individuals in ecological characteristics and social behavior. We tested the differences in habitat selection and home range size between the translocated and resident individuals and compared the spatial overlap between the groups. As expected, the dissimilarities decreased annually. The translocated and resident ibex almost immediately selected the same habitat resources, but the translocated individuals required 3 years to become fully socially assimilated. Our results indicated that habitat selection by gregarious species in a new environment is primarily driven by specific ecological requirements and that sociality plays a significant role. The translocated individuals tended to colonize areas already occupied by residents, either to fulfill social requirements and/or because the location of resident individuals may indicate high-quality habitat.

We released 12 foxes onto NPR-1 in 1989 and 28 foxes in 1990. Of the 12 foxes released in 1989, 10 died within 1 year. Of 28 foxes released in 1990, 1 was still alive, 24 were dead, and the fate of 3 was undetermined when the study was terminated on 30 April 1992. Annual survivorship of translocated foxes was 0.03, which was less than survivorship of free-ranging foxes (0.35). Survivorship was not influenced by year of release, sex or age of translocated animals, or terrain in which foxes were released. Predation was the main cause of death. Six foxes survived through 1 breeding season, and 3 of these 6 foxes survived through 2 breeding seasons. Four of the 6 foxes bred with free-ranging foxes. Excluding 1 fox that moved 124 km before being killed by a vehicle, the distance between the release site and the location of death averaged 9.9 km (SE 1.9) for 11 foxes released in 1989 and 4.4 km (SE 1.1) for 24 adults released in 1990. The distance between the release site and the location of death was less for foxes released from pens in hilly terrain (3.1 km, SE 1.7) than for foxes released in level terrain (5.6 km, SE 1.5).

Survivorship also may have been low because foxes were not familiar with their environment, including food and cover locations.

Aims Following unsuccessful attempts to increase the abundance of yellow-footed rock-wallaby populations through concerted goat control across the southern extent of their range, the primary aim of our study was to determine whether fox predation was limiting the recovery of wallaby populations. Methods Intensive fox-control programs (1080 baiting) were initiated around wallaby subpopulations in New South Wales and South Australia. Wallaby numbers were monitored for a three-year period before and after the initiation of fox control, and ANCOVA used to examine for differences between the subpopulation's rate of increase (r). Observational data were used to determine the demographic effects of fox predation on wallaby colonies in New South Wales. Key results Wallaby subpopulations that were treated with fox control increased significantly, while experimental control subpopulations remained at consistently low levels. Juvenile and subadult wallabies were apparent within the treated New South Wales subpopulation, but almost absent from the control subpopulation, suggesting that fox predation focussed primarily on these age classes. Conclusions Fox predation is a major limiting factor for southern wallaby populations and fox control should be the primary management action to achieve species recovery. Implications Although a significant limiting factor, the regulatory effect of fox predation was not assessed and, as such, it cannot be confirmed as being the causal factor responsible for the historic declines in wallaby abundance.

However, these stocking activities may also attract additional predators to a site. This case study aimed to investigate whether stocking of fish leads to higher otter densities in linear freshwater habitats in Central Europe. Otter faeces and data on fish stocks were collected in the province of Lower Austria along two salmonid streams, which differ considerably in fisheries management strategies. We used non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS) methods (genetic analysis of otter faeces) to ascertain otter individuals. Prey fish populations were assessed comparing length frequencies and fish biomass obtained from electrofishing series and data on stocking measures. Individual identification and socio-spatial organisation of resident otters revealed similar otter densities for both streams with 0.22 and 0.23 resident adult otters per stream kilometre. Length frequency distribution and biomass of fish indicated disappearance of stocked specimen at the time of electrofishing surveys and showed no significant difference of fish stocks between the streams. These results suggest that stocking activities may not affect the number of otter territories along the two streams studied, because availability of stocked fish is limited to angling season. We conclude that stocked streams may provide seasonally important food resources for otters, but raise the question whether stocked fish substantially contribute to the diet to raise carrying capacity for otters in linear freshwater habitats throughout a year.

Reasons for this failure have not been well studied.

We compared these factors at primary active dams and at control sites located in stream reaches that were physically suitable for dam-building beavers but where none occurred. Beaver dams mostly occurred at sites that were not grazed or where there was some alternative grazing management, but were mostly absent at sites within Forest Service cattle allotments. Results indicated that cattle grazing influenced the relation between vegetation variables and beaver presence. The availability of willows (Salix spp.) was the most important plant variable for the presence of beaver dams.

We translocated woodrats from genetically diverse populations in the core of the species range to 4 previously occupied sites (reintroductions) and 2 sites supporting genetically depauperate populations (reinforcements) in Indiana (U.S.A.). In 2 reintroduction sites and 1 reinforcement site, we distributed anthelmintic baits to passively deworm raccoons and reduce the risk of woodrat exposure to roundworms. The remaining sites served as controls. We used raccoon latrine surveys and fecal flotation to monitor temporal variability in roundworm prevalence and effect of treatment. We used live trapping and microsatellite genotyping to monitor the demographic and genetic response of translocated populations over the following 54 months. At the conclusion of the study, 4 of 6 translocations were successfully maintaining abundance through local recruitment. The distribution of anthelmintic baits reduced levels of roundworm contamination, but levels of contamination were also low in 2 of 3 control sites. Reintroductions failed at control sites, one of which was due to high roundworm exposure. The other failed control reintroduction was likely attributable to demographic stochasticity and limited reproductive potential following initial mortality within the first 4 months.

In 2009 we established a captive breeding program with 12 wild-caught individuals (4.8) collected from Indiana and Pennsylvania. Restricting breeding to wild-caught individuals, over 26 months we produced 19 litters comprised of 43 pups (26.17), of which 40 (24.16) survived to weaning. In sum, wild-caught individuals readily habituated to the captive environment and the low fecundity of woodrats was offset by high survival rates for both adults and juveniles. Therefore, when managed appropriately, captive Allegheny woodrat populations should be capable of supporting the release of surplus individuals to augment in situ conservation measures.

For arboreal mammals, canopy bridges, glider poles and vegetated medians are used to provide safe passage across roads. However, the effectiveness of these measures is unknown. We investigate the effect of canopy bridges, glider poles and vegetated medians on squirrel glider movement across a freeway in south-east Australia. We monitored structures directly using motion-triggered cameras and passive integrated transponder (PIT) scanners. Further, post-mitigation radio-tracking was compared to a pre-mitigation study. Squirrel gliders used all structure types to cross the freeway, while the unmitigated freeway remained a barrier to movement. However, movement was not restored to the levels observed at non-freeway sites. Nevertheless, based on the number and frequency of individuals crossing, mitigation is likely to provide some level of functional connectivity. The rate of crossing increased over several years as animals habituated to the structure. We also found that crossing rate can be a misleading indicator of effectiveness if the number of individuals crossing is not identified. Therefore, studies should employ long-term monitoring and identify individuals crossing if inferences about population connectivity are to be made from movement data alone. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Movement re-established but not restored: Inferring the effectiveness of road-crossing mitigation for a gliding mammal by monitoring use",0

Many studies have monitored the use of structures by wildlife, but studies that also incorporate individual identification methods can offer additional insights into their effectiveness. Aims We monitored the use of wildlife crossing structures by arboreal marsupials along the Hume Freeway in south-eastern Australia to (1) determine the species using these structures and their frequency of crossing, (2) determine the number and demographic characteristics of individuals crossing, and (3) use the rate of crossing by individuals to infer the types of movement that occurred. Methods We used motion-triggered cameras to monitor five canopy bridges and 15 glider pole arrays installed at 13 sites along the Hume Freeway. The five canopy bridges were also monitored with passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tag readers to identify the rate of use by individuals. Key results Five species of arboreal marsupial were detected using canopy bridges and glider poles at 11 sites. Our analysis suggested that increasing the number and the distance between poles in a glider pole array reduced the rate of use by squirrel gliders. The PIT tag and camera footage revealed that the structures were used by adult males, adult females and juveniles, suggesting that all demographic groups are capable of using canopy bridges and glider poles. At two canopy bridges, multiple squirrel gliders and common brushtail possums crossed more than once per night. Conclusions Given that previous studies have shown that the freeway is a barrier to movement, and that many of the species detected crossing are subject to road mortality, we conclude that canopy bridges and glider poles benefit arboreal marsupials by providing safe access to resources that would otherwise be inaccessible. Implications Although the factors influencing crossing rate require further study, our analysis suggests that glider pole arrays with fewer poles placed closer together are likely to be more successful for squirrel gliders. The individual identification methods applied here offer insights that are not possible from measuring the rate of use alone and should be adopted in future monitoring studies.","Monitoring the use of road-crossing structures by arboreal marsupials: Insights gained from motion-triggered cameras and passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags",1

The overarching goal of our work was to investigate the demographic response of the hazel dormouse (. Muscardinus avellanarius) to forest management. We focused on a set of key individual (survival and litter size) and population (abundance of individuals) parameters to test whether forest management affects dormice and which habitat variables are responsible for such effects. We surveyed a dormice population for 3 years in a continuous forest in central Italy including sites subjected to different management regimes: 5 coppiced stands (2 recently coppiced and 3 old coppice stands), 2 abandoned stands with regrowing forest and 3 high forest stands. We found a strong effect of forest management on hazel dormice, acting mainly through the variation in food resources. Regrowing forests were the most suitable stands for dormice, whereas recent coppices were the most unsuitable, with an ephemeral presence of a few individuals. Old coppices and high forest stands were both able to sustain local populations but at lower densities and with a higher mortality and/or emigration of younger and/or weaker individuals than the regrowing forest. Through our detailed analyses we were able to uncover the demographic mechanism underlying the effects of forest management on hazel dormice populations; our findings strongly suggest that maintaining an heterogeneous successional composition may be the most effective strategy for the conservation of this species.","Forest management affects individual and population parameters of the hazel dormouse <i>Muscardinus avellanarius</i>",0

In contrast, on the road where access control has been enforced, habitat destruction has been minimal, but several wildlife species showed reductions in their populations, apparently related to changes in the subsistence practices of local Waorani hunters that settled along the road after its construction. In this area, economic subsidies and free transportation from the oil companies, access to the road, more efficient hunting technologies, and market incentives have increased the impacts of hunting by the Waorani, resulting in depletion of the local wildlife populations.

Wildlife habitat, in particular, has been the focus of CWD investigations aimed at maintaining mammal species in managed forests. Piles and windrows of post-harvest woody debris could be designed to provide connectivity and habitat across clearcut openings for a wide array of mammalian species. Populations of microtines, such as the long-tailed vole (Microtus longicaudus), occur in early successional post-harvest habitats with vegetative and CWD cover, and may be potential pests feeding on newly planted trees. The role of CWD as habitat structures that attract voles and perhaps their predators may be part of a predator/prey pest-control scenario. Thus, we tested three hypotheses (H) that woody debris arranged in large piles and windrows, at a real-world scale, would increase (H1) the abundance, reproduction, and survival of long-tailed voles; (H2) the relative abundance of small weasels (Mustela spp.), and (H3) the incidence of feeding damage by voles to planted seedlings, compared with a dispersed (conventional) treatment on clearcut sites. Long-tailed voles were intensively live-trapped from 2007 to 2009 in replicated woody debris treatments of dispersed, piles, and windrows near Summerland in south-central British Columbia, Canada.Mean abundance of long-tailed voles was significantly higher (6.4-8.0 times) in treatment sites with piles and windrows than in the dispersed CWD treatment. Patterns in reproduction, recruitment, and survival generally followed those of abundance. There was a curvilinear regression relationship (r=0.72; P<0.01) between mean abundance of long-tailed voles and mean volume of CWD per ha across the dispersed, piles, and windrow treatments. A range of 400-600m3/ha of CWD in piles or windrows was required as habitat for viable populations of long-tailed voles on these clearcuts, at least during this 3-year period. Winter snow tracking data indicated that there was significantly more weasel activity in the treatment sites with piles than those with dispersed CWD, and similar activity in the dispersed and windrow sites. The predictions of H1 and H2 were supported. The incidence of feeding damage (<10%) by voles to planted seedlings was similar among treatment sites, and hence H3 was not supported.

Southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) disappear from clearcuts within the first year or two after harvest, at least in studies in coniferous and mixed forests of western North America. Post-harvest woody debris arranged in large piles and windrows supports populations of M. gapperi on clearcuts and may extend their persistence there. Aims. To test the hypotheses (H) that for M. gapperi, (H1) population parameters of abundance, reproduction, and survival would be higher in windrow-forest than isolated windrow sites, and higher or similar to those in interior old forest sites; (H2) connectivity provided by windrow-forest structures will mitigate potential negative effects of clearcuts and abundance of M. gapperi will remain similar at the abrupt edge between forest and new clearcuts; and (H3) connectivity provided by windrow-forest structures will allow increased movements between both habitats. Methods. Study areas were located in three forest ecological zones in southern British Columbia, Canada. Populations of M. gapperi were sampled from 2010 to 2012 in three types of habitats on new clearcuts: isolated windrows of woody debris, windrows attached to uncut old forest, and in uncut old forest. Key results. Higher mean values of abundance and number of juvenile recruits of M. gapperi in the isolated windrow and windrow-forest sites than forest sites was contrary to our prediction for H1. In support of H2, we could not detect any differences in the mean number of captures among forest, edge and windrow sections of the windrow-forest sites, nor in the mean range length among the three habitat types. For H3, connectivity provided by windrow-forest structures may mitigate potential negative effects on abundance for M. gapperi at the abrupt edge between forest and new clearcuts. Conclusions and Implications. Voles did not commonly move between the forest and windrow habitats, but did move readily within forest and within windrows. Substantial movement by M. gapperi within windrows suggested that this microtine will move along windrows and potentially use these paths of connectivity to cross clearcuts. If the prey base is present, windrow connectivity may enhance these open areas for small mustelids and other carnivores and help maintain abundance and diversity of some forest mammals on clearcuts.","Responses of red-backed voles (<i>Myodes gapperi</i>) to windrows of woody debris along forest-clearcut edges",0

We tested hypotheses that abundance and species diversity of forest-floor small mammals would be lower on conventional clear-cuts than in uncut forest; abundance and species diversity of forest-floor small mammals and relative activity and species richness of winter mammals would be higher on clear-cut sites with woody debris arranged in large piles or windrows than a dispersed treatment of debris.

We captured all 9 species of forest-floor small mammals. Compared with uncut forest, clear-cutting had no effect on mean total abundance of the small-mammal community, and species richness and diversity were either similar or higher. With respect to habitat preference, generalist species increased while specialist species declined. Habitat structures of large piles and windrows of woody debris on clear-cuts dramatically ameliorated these responses.

In 2001 the Terai Arc Landscape programme was initiated to connect 11 protected areas in Nepal and north-west India and facilitate dispersal of megafauna and manage them as metapopulations. Corridors that were restored under the programme and that connect Bardia and Suklaphanta with protected areas in India are now used by the greater one-horned rhinoceros.

Given the global decline of large carnivores, documenting the results of such attempts is crucial for future conservation management. Here we examined the reintroduction of brown bears into the Italian Alps. The majority of bears released (10 individuals) adapted well to the release area and this resulted in the increase of the brown bear population. At the end of 2012, the area with a stable presence of females was around 1250km2 (minimum density=3 bear/100km2).

No less than 21 young males dispersed into adjacent Italian regions or into other countries, such as Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. However, despite a high mortality rate and at least two cases of illegal killing reported in the last 2 years (2013 and 2014), a remarkable population growth rate (current level of 15.6%) has been observed.The damages correlated with bear population size (F= 17.922, p<. 0.01) were primarily inflicted on beehives (39%) and livestock (26%), with an economic relevance of € 41,374 per year for compensation and € 23,527 per year for prevention.

And yet, public opinion changed radically, from a widespread acceptance of bears at the beginning of the project to an opposition to their presence, the increase of their population, and the new translocations aiming at replacing problem bears that had previously been removed. According to the present trend, the population may reach a range of 60-94 individuals in 2017.

Operations to restore conifer plantations on ancient woodland sites (PAWS) with native broadleaves may be especially hazardous to dormice populations, since dormouse densities are generally lower here so sudden perturbations may cause local extinction. Recent policy for restoring PAWS to broadleaved and the need to comply with European legislation has emphasised the need to devise appropriate but pragmatic forest management protocols involving the phased removal of conifers over time. Dormice were handled and individually marked on a single 12 ha conifer PAWS site from 2000 and a density index calculated from 2002 to 2007. In four adjacent study areas, a different form of PAWS restoration was carried out in 2003 to remove c. 33% of conifers.

Livestock guardian dogs (LGDs) may be able to reduce or eliminate predation, but their effectiveness in Australian grazing systems has not been systematically evaluated. In particular, little is known about the effectiveness of LGDs in situations where they range freely over large areas in company with large numbers of livestock. Aims We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of LGDs as currently used in Australia and determine the factors influencing effectiveness, in particular in relation to scale of management. We also documented how LGDs are managed in Australia, evaluated their cost effectiveness, and identified factors that influence the number of dogs required in different property situations. Methods We conducted a telephone survey of 150 livestock producers with LGDs in Australia, including all livestock types and property situations, in all States. Ten producers were visited, of which one is detailed as a case study. Key results Effectiveness was apparently high: 65.7% of respondents reported that predation ceased after obtaining LGDs, and a further 30.2% reported a decrease of predation. When the number of stock per dog exceeds 100, LGDs might not be able to eliminate all predation. Dogs are often kept free-ranging on large properties where wild dogs are the main predator, but are usually restricted in their movements on smaller properties or with smaller predators. The cost of obtaining a LGD is returned within 13 years after the dog starts working. The number of dogs required for a property mainly depends on the number of livestock needing protection, and the main type of predator in the area. Conclusions Provided a sufficient number of LGDs are used, they can be as effective in protecting livestock from predators in Australia when ranging freely on large properties with large numbers of livestock as they are in small-scale farming systems. Implications LGDs can provide a cost-effective alternative to conventional predator control methods in Australia's extensive grazing enterprises, potentially reducing or eliminating the need for other forms of control. LGDs could play a major role in securing the viability of livestock businesses and reconciling peoplepredator conflict in Australia. © 2012 CSIRO.","Good dog!

When these marshes are managed for nature conservation purposes, livestock grazing is often used to counter the dominance of the tall grass Elytrigia atherica, and the subsequent decline in plant species richness. However, it remains unclear what is the optimal choice of livestock species and stocking density to benefit biodiversity of various trophic levels. To fill this knowledge gap, we set up a triplicate, full factorial grazing experiment with cattle and horse grazing at low and high stocking densities (0.5 or 1 animal ha-1) at the mainland coast of the Dutch Wadden Sea. Here, we present the results after 4 years and integrate these with previously published results from the same experiment to assess effects of livestock grazing on various trophic groups. Stocking density affected almost all measured variables: high stocking densities favoured plant species richness and suppression of E. atherica, whereas low stocking densities favoured abundances of voles, pollinators and flowers. Densities of different functional groups of birds showed no significant response to the regimes, but tended to be somewhat higher under 0.5 horse and 1 cattle ha-1. Choice of livestock species had fewer and smaller effects than stocking density. Horse grazing was detrimental to vole density, and showed an interactive effect with stocking density for Asteraceae flower abundance. Multidiversity, a synthetic whole-ecosystem biodiversity measure, did not differ among regimes. These results are discussed in the light of other results from the same experiment. Because of these contrasting effects on different trophic groups, we advise concurrent application of different grazing regimes within a spatial mosaic, with the inclusion of long-term abandonment. High density horse grazing, however, is detrimental to biodiversity.","Effects of grazing management on biodiversity across trophic levels â€“ the importance of livestock species and stocking density in salt marshes",0

Two common forms of such governance are protected areas, and community lands open to limited resource extraction. We studied wildlife occurrences in the north-east Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, where the Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary (EWS) is situated adjacent to community lands governed by the Bugun and Sherdukpen tribes. We conducted transect-based mammal sign surveys and camera trapping for mammals (>0.5kg), and interviewed members of the resident tribes to understand their hunting practices and causes of wildlife declines. Interviews indicated hunting-mediated declines in the abundances of mammals such as the tiger Panthera tigris, gaur Bos gaurus and river otters Lutrogale and Aonyx species. Larger species such as B.gaurus were much more abundant within EWS than outside of it. Community-managed lands harbored smaller bodied species, including some of conservation importance such as the red panda Ailurus fulgens, clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa and golden cat Pardofelis temminckii. Our findings show that protected areas may have important non-substitutive values but adjoining community-managed lands may also have important conservation values for a different set of species.","Large mammal use of protected and community-managed lands in a biodiversity hotspot",0

However, the presence of water inside culverts can seriously limit their effectiveness. The implementation of dry ledges can be a good measure to allow crossing when flooded. So far, there is a lack of knowledge on the effectiveness of dry ledges combined with fencing for a wide diversity of vertebrates. The main goal of this study is to evaluate how the presence of dry ledge affect culvert use for Mediterranean mesocarnivores (red fox Vulpes vulpes, stone marten Martes foina, European badger Meles meles, European otter Lutra lutra and common genet Genetta genetta). Between January and March 2008, wooden dry ledges were placed in 15 of 32 surveyed culverts. Additionally 100. meters of small mesh size and buried fences were installed along each side of all culverts. During one year we used video surveillance and track-plates to detect crossing events over seven consecutive nights per season in each monitored culvert. We evaluate the relative importance of dry ledges on culvert use and compare the number of road-kills within a 100. m buffer radius around the culverts before and after fence installation and culverts that were never fenced (control culverts). Although different species responded to culvert features differently, the presence of dry ledges was the most relevant feature explaining crossing events, in particular, for stone martens and genets. The fencing used did not reduce mammals road-kill prevalence. Our results imply that in order to improve culvert use, road managers should take into account the placement of ledges on culverts that remain flooded most of the year (more than 3. cm of water-depth). We also suggest exploring the role of ledge size and construction materials to increase the likelihood of being used by foxes and badgers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Do dry ledges reduce the barrier effect of roads?",0

It is frequently used to solve human-animal conflicts and recently has been applied as a mitigation tool when animals inhabit land desired for development. However, its success is uncertain and involves risks. In order to provide useful information to wildlife managers about the effect of translocation distance on animal movement behavior and survival, we translocated 40 Long-haired field mice (Abrothrix longipilis) at different distances from their territories (0-1,300 m) in central Chile and recorded the location and survival of each mouse over 3 days. Translocated animals showed low release site fidelity and traveled two- to four-fold longer distances than the nontranslocated group. Only mice translocated at shorter distances (100 m) oriented their movement toward their origin site and had a high probability of homing (80 %). There were threshold distances from after which homing and traveling strongly decreased. All individuals released close to their capture site (=100 m) remained alive, while mortality reached 22 % at longer translocation distances, principally as a result of fighting between rodents. Therefore, long translocation distances prevented short-term homing and decreased traveled distances (a desirable outcome), but risks associated with conspecific encounters need to be avoided. Because mice showed a high motivation to explore surroundings, it is advisable to release animals in sites with alternative places to colonize. Our results emphasize the need for a strong justification in wildlife translocation projects and the development of alternative techniques to improve animal welfare and conservation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","There is no place like home: high homing rate and increased mortality after translocation of a small mammal",0

However, success of such operations is often low due to poor short-term survival and experimental evidence is required to improve restocking results. We tested the impact of different release conditions on survival and reproduction of captive bred common hamsters (Cricetus cricetus L. 1758), a highly endangered species in Western Europe. As predation plays a determinant role for released hamsters, especially during the first days after restocking, we performed two release experiments intending to reduce mortality: we tested (1) the efficiency of terrestrial predator proof electric fences and (2) the impact of improved shelter availability. We assessed both survival rate and reproductive success by radiotracking 70. hamsters between release date and the end of their aboveground active period. Reducing contact between released animals and predators thanks to electric fences had a strong positive impact on hamsters' survival and allowed them to have enough time to reproduce. It also appeared that release of hamsters was more efficient in wheat crop than in alfalfa. As expected, wheat harvest, inducing a sudden lack of shelter, negatively impacted restocking success. Finally, lifetime after release affected the number of litters per female and varied with individual characteristics: it decreased with burrow change frequency and was slightly lower for males. We conclude that electric fences associated with permanent well-developed vegetative cover like unharvested wheat seem to be suitable for releasing hamsters. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Testing restocking methods for an endangered species: effects of predator exclusion and vegetation cover on common hamster (<i>Cricetus cricetus</i>) survival and reproduction",0

Among some remnant populations, cottontails occupy small patches of thicket habitat where they experience high mortality rates as a consequence of limited food during winter. This limitation causes rabbits to forage away from cover where they are exposed to predators. Although conservation efforts are emerging to reverse the decline of New England cottontails, most are directed toward improving long-term viability by increasing the abundance of suitable habitats. Such efforts do little to improve the short-term survival of remaining cottontails. To address this immediate need, we evaluated the use of supplemental food as an approach to improve overwinter survival rates. We speculated that by positioning feeders in close proximity to escape cover, rabbits would be less vulnerable to predators. We evaluated this approach using eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus) as a research surrogate because this species is readily available and has similar habitat requirements to New England cottontails. Transmitter-equipped eastern cottontails were randomly assigned to either a fed or unfed group. Remotely-triggered cameras were also used to gauge use of feeders by cottontails and visits by other species. Winter survival rates were substantially greater for fed rabbits (70%) than for unfed rabbits (32%). Cameras revealed that rabbits were the most frequent consumer and that there was only limited carnivore activity near feeders. We conclude that supplemental feeding may improve survival of remaining New England cottontails as efforts to increase habitat availability continue to develop. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Can supplemental food increase winter survival of a threatened cottontail rabbit?",0

Large carnivore translocation is one such strategy but it has shown limited success. Many reported examples used methods that likely contributed to their failure. We conducted six leopard (Panthera pardus) translocations (three males, three females) within Namibia to test specific criteria for improved protocols. We moved leopards 402.7 km (SD = 279.6 km, range 47–754 km). Overall translocation success, using strict criteria, was 67 % and increased to 83 % when post-release conflict was not considered in this assessment. Four individuals successfully established new territories after exploratory periods of <2 months. One female died in a road accident shortly after release and a male resumed killing livestock that were illegally herded within a protected area. Both surviving females produced cubs—the ultimate sign of success. When compared with resident leopards (six males, six females), translocated individuals showed no significant difference in range behaviour, survivorship or likelihood of conflict. At their capture sites, livestock depredation ceased for a minimum of 16 months, thus at least temporarily alleviating conflict. We used our successful protocol to develop a translocation suitability model for determining appropriate release sites. For Namibia, this model predicts potential recipient habitat of 117,613 km2, an area sufficient to support up to 87 leopard translocations. Where alternative conservation strategies have failed and managers decide to proceed with translocations, we recommend the application of our conservative protocol to identify the most suitable recipient locations. Our study demonstrates the potential value of translocation under specific circumstances and as part of a larger conflict management repertoire.

We conducted seven trapping sessions and used radio-tracking and camera traps to monitor survival, reproduction and recruitment to the population over 36 months. Blood samples were collected pre-release and during two trapping sessions post-release to assess nutritional health. The survival rate of founders was 63%, with all losses occurring within 10 weeks of release. Post-release blood biochemistry indicated that surviving warru adapted to their new environment and food sources. Female warru conceived within 6 months of release; 28 births were recorded during the study period and 52% of births successfully recruited to the population. Our results suggest that captive-bred warru are capable of establishing and persisting in the absence of introduced predators. However, the high mortality rate immediately post-release, with only a modest recruitment rate, suggests that future releases into areas where predators and competitors are present should use a trial approach to determine the viability of reintroduction. We recommend that future releases of warru into unfenced areas include an intensive monitoring period in the first 3 months post-release followed by a comprehensive long-term monitoring schedule to facilitate effective adaptive management.","Monitoring for adaptive management in a trial reintroduction of the black-footed rock-wallaby <i>Petrogale lateralis</i>",1

Although California bighorn sheep are no longer recognized as a distinct subspecies, they are smaller and adapted to a milder climate than either the native bighorn sheep of North Dakota or introduced bighorn sheep from Montana.

To examine this issue, we compared the activity of small mammals in forest floor habitats with and without logging residues in a Malaysian production forest using a camera trapping technique. We tested the hypothesis that the activity of small mammals would be higher on forest floors with logging residues when compared with those without them; our study affirmatively supported this hypothesis. Therefore, logging residues are expected to have positive roles in maintaining small mammal diversity at the ground level in production forests. Recently commercial use of logging residues has been promoted; however, removing all logging residues from a production forest would severely and negatively affect the diversity of ground-dwelling small mammals.

There was little evidence to suggest any difference in home-range size between woylies inside and outside the sanctuary. Woylies were more likely to be found in the slope and low-lying valley habitats, which have greater water-holding capacity and sandier soils. These relatively large seasonal home ranges, compared with previously published estimates for the species, may be accounted for by low population density, lower seasonal food availability and clustered food distribution. Monitoring the home-range size of woylies within the sanctuary may assist in identifying the carrying capacity of the sanctuary, which has implications for how this population is managed.","Seasonal home range and habitat use of a critically endangered marsupial (<i>Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi</i>) inside and outside a predator-proof sanctuary",0

It is therefore important to evaluate in the field the effectiveness of nonlethal control techniques that should be economically feasible and socially acceptable. Until now, the effect of deterrents on felids has not been assessed systematically. We hypothesized that the occurrence of alien objects or sounds would scare the felids away, at least temporally. In this study, we applied visual and auditory deterrents in paddocks in a natural reserve of Central Mexico. We performed field tests in six ranches with predation problems: four as treatment plots and two as controls. To test the effectiveness of deterrents, the numbers of tracks and photos of felids, and the number of attacks to livestock that occurred during the test period were compared between the treatment and the control ranches. We also performed a cost-benefit analysis to assess the feasibility of the application of deterrents. Deterrents were effective in reducing predation during the 2-month test. The benefit of their application was 11 times higher than the annual cost of handling of predation for cattle owners and 3 times for owners of goats. Deterrents appear a useful tool that could assist ranchers in livestock protection, indirectly contributing to the conservation of wild felids and promoting their coexistence with rural communities. © 2014 The Zoological Society of London.","Effectiveness of low-cost deterrents in decreasing livestock predation by felids: a case in Central Mexico",0

As a consequence of the resulting loss of habitat heterogeneity, numerous species associated with traditional farmland have undergone severe population declines. To mitigate the negative effects of intensive agriculture on farmland biodiversity, agri-environment schemes (AES) have been adopted in various European countries since the early 1990s. The effects of AES have been evaluated for different taxa, but rarely for larger mammals like the brown hare (Lepus europaeus), a characteristic species of traditional open farmland.Using spotlight counts from 58 brown hare monitoring study sites over 17. years, we analysed the effects of land-use and several agri-environment scheme options on brown hare density in the Swiss lowland. We used open-population binomial mixture models to jointly model abundance and detection probability, thereby accounting for imperfect detection of hares. Mean observed counts of brown hares in Switzerland from 1992 to 2008 suggested a slight decline followed by a recovery in arable study sites, whereas a sustained decline was apparent in grassland sites. Mean detection probability ranged widely from year to year (arable: 0.33-0.70; grassland: 0.21-0.80). When accounting for imperfect detection, a population recovery was apparent in both land-use types, although hare densities remained at low levels compared to other European countries.The amount of extensively managed hay meadows seemed to have a positive effect on brown hare abundance both in arable and grassland sites. Hedgerows were also positively related to hare density, although only in arable study sites. The amount of set-asides/wildflower strips and brown hare density were related neither in arable nor in grassland sites. This result was probably caused by the fairly low percentages of this AES option in our study sites.Habitat improvements by means of AES indicate some positive effects on brown hare populations in Switzerland, but the quantity and quality of AES must still be increased. Combined with a binomial mixture model correcting for imperfect detection, spotlight counts are an effective tool for estimating population trends, especially for large-scale and long-term surveys like the Swiss brown hare monitoring. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Population trends of brown hares in Switzerland: the role of land-use and ecological compensation areas",0

However, predicting how reintroduced populations will spread is difficult, and past reintroductions often lacked a thorough assessment of habitat availability and connectivity. Using the case of reintroduced European bison (Bison bonasus L.) in the northern Carpathians, we show how habitat suitability models in combination with connectivity assessments based on circuit theory can remedy such shortcomings, and identify potential habitat patches and corridors between these. European bison were reintroduced in our study area in the 1960s, and against prior expectation, have not spread along the Carpathian ridge, but instead expanded their range towards human settlements. Our analyses provide an explanation for this pattern. Although we identified a network of suitable habitat patches along the Carpathian ridge, the functional connections between them were limited due to a number of major barriers to movement. To avoid future conflicts between European bison and people, and to achieve the long-term goal of a viable bison metapopulation in this region, conservation action should focus on establishing connectivity between habitat patches through the creation and legal protection of corridors and wildlife passages, which would benefit Carpathian wildlife in general. Our study emphasizes the importance of landscape-scale connectivity analyses to guide restoration efforts, and of adaptive management to ensure the success of reintroduction projects.","Understanding unexpected reintroduction outcomes: Why aren't European bison colonizing suitable habitat in the Carpathians?",0

Such programmes could help to reverse local declines in ibex and argali populations, and consequently snow leopard populations, while simultaneously improving the economic status of local people. However, in practice the desired effect may not materialize. To investigate the premise, we estimated the population density of the snow leopard, using a spatial capture-recapture model based on camera trapping in two study areas (each c. 1,000 km2) in the Tajik Pamirs: A well-managed trophy hunting concession and an otherwise similar area where grazing and poaching are unmanaged. We used distance-Truncated counts to assess relative densities of wild and domestic ungulates between sites, and faecal analyses to compare the dietary habits of snow leopards. Our data were limited in scope but suggested that the density of snow leopards and the relative density of wild and domestic ungulates may have been greater in the hunting concession, where wild ungulates accounted for a greater proportion of prey items. Our results provide preliminary evidence that trophy hunting of ungulates may be a viable tool for achieving snow leopard conservation goals; however, we conclude that further investigation is necessary to adequately address the question.","Investigating the potential impact of trophy hunting of wild ungulates on snow leopard <i>Panthera uncia</i> conservation in Tajikistan",0

Supplemental feeding of wildlife has high potential for influencing the behaviour and diet of opportunistic omnivores, such as bears. Supplemental feeding of brown bears Ursus arctos is a common practice in several European countries, but the effects of this controversial and expensive management measure on bear diet and behaviour are poorly understood. We analysed 714 brown bear scats collected throughout the year in three regions of Slovenia with different densities of supplemental feeding sites. Supplemental food was the most important food category in the bear diet and represented 34% of the annual estimated dietary energy content (maize: 22%, livestock carrion: 12%). The proportion of supplemental food in the diet varied with season and region, being highest in spring and in the region with the highest density of feeding sites. However, considerable seasonal changes in bear diet, despite year-round access to supplemental food, suggest that bears prefer high-energy natural food sources, particularly insects, fruits, and hard mast, when available. Despite high availability and use of supplemental food, human-bear conflicts are frequent in Slovenia. In addition, evidence from earlier studies suggests that changes in diet and foraging behaviour due to supplemental feeding may affect several aspects of bear biology and in some cases increase the probability of human-bear conflicts. Thus, we caution against promoting unconditional supplemental feeding as a measure to prevent or reduce human-bear conflicts.","Fast food bears: brown bear diet in a human-dominated landscape with intensive supplemental feeding",0

We installed 3 pairs of modified wooden utility poles as crossing structures to enable gliding over the road in both directions.

In 2012 Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) implemented the national 10-year Conservation and Management Strategy for the Elephant in Kenya, which includes an action aimed at testing whether beehive fences can be used to mitigate human–elephant conflict. From 2012 to 2015, we field-tested the efficacy of beehive fences to protect 10 0.4-ha farms next to Tsavo East National Park from elephants. We hung a series of beehives every 10 m around the boundary of each farm plot. The hives were linked with strong wire. After an initial pilot test with 2 farms, the remaining 8 of 10 beehive fences also contained 2-dimensional dummy hives between real beehives to help reduce the cost of the fence. Each trial plot had a neighboring control plot of the same size within the same farm. Of the 131 beehives deployed 88% were occupied at least once during the 3.5-year trial. Two hundred and fifty-three elephants, predominantly 20–45 years old entered the community farming area, typically during the crop- ripening season. Eighty percent of the elephants that approached the trial farms were kept out of the areas protected by the beehive fences, and elephants that broke a fence were in smaller than average groups. Beehive fences not only kept large groups of elephants from invading the farmland plots but the farmers also benefited socially and financially from the sale of 228 kg of elephant-friendly honey. As news of the success of the trial spread, a further 12 farmers requested to join the project, bringing the number of beehive fence protected farms to 22 and beehives to 297. This demonstrates positive adoption of beehive fences as a community mitigation tool. Understanding the response of elephants to the beehive fences, the seasonality of crop raiding and fence breaking, and the willingness of the community to engage with the mitigation method will help contribute to future management strategies for this high human–elephant conflict hotspot and other similar areas in Kenya.","Beehive fences as a multidimensional conflict-mitigation tool for farmers coexisting with elephants",0

The United States Forest Service is currently conducting an oak savanna restoration in the Manistee National Forest in Lower Michigan using forest thinning and prescribed burning. To understand management impacts on small mammal communities, we live trapped small mammals in each of the mechanically thinned plots (i.e., bulldozer, masticator, and shear cutter) and control plots in five blocks over six years (2008-2013), as well as measured vegetation variables each year. Initially, we used a permutation multivariate analysis of variance (perMANOVA) to determine if there were treatment and year interactions for both small mammal community assemblages and vegetation variables. We then compared changes in small mammal diversity, relative abundance, and vegetation variables among treatments using exploratory randomized block design analysis of variances (ANOVAs). Canopy cover was significantly lower in bulldozer and shear cutter thinned plots than control plots five years following thinning. We observed significant treatment by year interactions in how the small mammal community responded. A large increase in relative abundance of white-footed mice occurred one year post-thinning in all treatments. Within 1-2 years of treatment, thirteen-lined ground squirrels and meadow jumping mice, both open-canopy grassland species became established on thinned plots.

This situation offered an opportunity to test the efficacy of preventative management options such as diversionary feeding and lethal removal of predators for improving calf survival. We monitored caribou calves (n = 536) in 4 calving areas (3 untreated, 1 treatment) for 2 years (2008–2009) followed by diversionary feeding of black bears and coyotes in 2010–2011 and lethal removal of coyotes in 2012–2013. We estimated calf survival for 70 days, the period calves and females remain on the calving grounds, and for 182 days, after which calves were considered recruited into the population. Calf survival was nearly constant over the 6-year study period on the untreated areas. Calf survival was initially lower on the treatment area compared to the untreated areas but increased substantially on the treatment area during the lethal removal period, especially during the initial 70-day period. Predation on calves by coyote decreased substantially during the lethal removal period. Diversionary feeding had little influence on survival rates.

As in the practice of adaptive management used in ecology, it is important to reduce uncertainty about the outcomes of various management actions. Ideally this evaluation will be done using a priori hypothesis testing, but retrospective analyses can provide important insights as to which methods work better than others. The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) conservation breeding program has a long history of active management and therefore is rich in potential lessons learned for panda and other endangered species breeding programs. Now self-sustaining and experiencing exponential growth, the panda population also provides sample sizes large enough to support rigorous statistical evaluation. A fundamental decision for any breeding program is whether to invest in development and application of assisted reproduction techniques or to promote natural mating. Here we analyze 21 years (1996–2016) of giant panda reproductive data from 304 insemination events to determine relative success rates of insemination methods and evaluate management strategies. The birth rate after natural mating was 60.7%, 50.6% for combined natural mating and artificial insemination techniques, and 18.5% for artificial insemination (AI). Within the combined insemination technique group, 81.8% of births could be attributed to the natural mating event with only 18.2% attributed to AI. These results suggest that while techniques for improving AI should continue to be explored and will play an important role for some conservation applications, behavioral and biological management to encourage natural mating should be the most important goal for conservation breeding of this species.","Analyzing the past to understand the future: natural mating yields better reproductive rates than artificial insemination in the giant panda",1

The offset targeted three threatened vertebrates: squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis), brown treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus) and superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii). Clearing led to the loss of 587 tree hollows and the offset was the placement of an equivalent number of nest boxes in nearby woodland (1:1 ratio). Of these, we monitored 324 nest boxes in six sample periods between 2010 and 2013, yielding 2485 individual checks of nest boxes. For the three target species, we found: (1) no records of nest box use by the superb parrot, (2) two records of the brown treecreeper (0–0.76% of accessible nest boxes used per survey period), and (3) seven records of use of nest boxes by the squirrel glider (0–2.1% of accessible nest boxes used per survey period). Rates of nest box use by the superb parrot and squirrel glider were markedly lower than rates of use of hollow-bearing trees observed in other investigations. Low levels of use by target species coupled with the extent of nest box attrition suggest the offset program will not have counterbalanced the loss of the hollow-bearing trees.

Our analyses focused on the common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula and common ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus. We found strong evidence of a gradient in occupancy levels ranging from highest in old growth woodland, approaching zero in plantings, with regrowth woodland intermediate between these two broad types of vegetation structure. Plantings were not occupied by either species at the outset of our investigation and were rarely colonized throughout the subsequent 10 years. We hypothesize that a lack of shelter sites in large old hollow-bearing trees is one of the key factors limiting the occurrence of plantings by cavity-dependent arboreal marsupials, suggesting a lag between planting establishment and the time required for plantings to become suitable habitat. We found the probability of colonization was positively related to the amount of vegetation cover in the surrounding landscape. Unexpectedly, colonization probability was not influenced by a temporal increase in woody vegetation cover surrounding a patch. A paucity of relationships between patch colonization and the temporal change in vegetation cover may be explained by the fact that most of the increased vegetation cover in our study landscapes over the past decade has resulted from establishment of plantings which are generally not suitable nesting habitat for arboreal marsupials. Our findings have key management implications such as emphasizing the value of old growth woodland for arboreal marsupials and of targeting restoration efforts around old growth and regrowth woodland patches, and the flawed notion of biodiversity offsets that allow replantings to compensate for clearing old growth woodland.","The vacant planting: limited influence of habitat restoration on patch colonization patterns by arboreal marsupials in south-eastern Australia",0

Selection of these sites could be attributed to the fact that the presence of cattle can function as an alarm system against possible predators, while the cattle grazing could itself promote palatable species of Poaceae that form part of the diet of this leporid.

Typically, the success of a translocation program is measured at the population source, with little attention given to the fate of translocated individuals. Here we use a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) translocation program from southeastern Australia as a case study to investigate the effects of translocation on individual animals. The koala is an iconic species that occurs at high densities in some parts of its southern range, leading to numerous conservation and animal welfare issues. Between 1997 and 2007 over 3,000 koalas from a high-density island population were captured, surgically sterilized, and translocated to the mainland. Annual post-translocation surveys at release sites revealed densities of â&0.4 koalas/ha, despite release densities of 1.0 koala/ha. Radiotracking studies indicate that low densities were because of both mortality and high dispersal of translocated individuals. We observed a mortality rate of 37.5% for translocated koalas in the first 12 months post-release. No deaths occurred among animals that were not sterilized and translocated. Translocated koalas moved greater distances than non-translocated animals. Monitoring of translocated individuals should be performed routinely during translocation programs for overabundant species. Due consideration must be given to what is an acceptable level of mortality for translocated individuals.

Several past studies have monitored the use of artificial breeding structures in the wild, but virtually none of them have investigated which demographic and environmental factors actually determine their effectiveness in facilitating reproductive success. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify those factors influencing breeding success in artificial structures. With this purpose we surveyed a declining population of a keystone species of Mediterranean ecosystems, namely the European wild rabbit. In Doñana National Park, we sampled during the course of two years the breeding success of wild rabbits from 47 artificial warrens, experimentally provided under different demographic and environmental conditions. In order to determine the relative importance of such factors, we applied an AIC model selection procedure to alternative biological hypothesis groups, postulating that breeding success in artificial structures would primarily depend on population density, food availability and/or predator limitation. We found that the efficiency of artificial warrens in facilitating rabbit reproductive success can vary, with an increase associated with greater pasture availability. Predator limitation by fencing also positively affected rabbit reproduction, but only in combination with high pasture availability. On their own, fencing treatment and population reinforcements had low and null effectiveness facilitating reproduction, respectively, as well as entailing significant economic and biological costs. The best way to improve breeding success in artificial structures, therefore, was through their strategic placement in potential high-quality habitats, i.e. with suitable pasture availability. We suggest that vegetation management can effectively increase carrying capacity and consequently the target species' reproductive success, especially in fast breeding species like the European wild rabbit.

Resource selection functions were used to assess habitat selection at 2 spatial scales using as covariates habitat type (grassland, open savanna, closed savanna, and hygrophilous forest), distance to forest edge, and distance to a main road. Habitat selection was modeled for different ages (juveniles and adults), activity (resting or active), and seasons (summer, transition, and winter) and was validated with individuals previously excluded from our analysis. Anteaters strongly selected areas dedicated to nature conservation. Adults showed higher model fit. Hygrophilous forest was positively selected and open savanna was avoided. Anteaters rested almost exclusively in forests. While active they increased the use of other habitats, except for open savanna. Grasslands were most used during the winter season, probably because they provide a constant food source and better cover than savannas.

The presence of hippopotamuses causes conflict with rice farmers as a result of crop damage and the absence of effective measures to protect crops. To develop an effective method for protecting rice fields, we studied the patterns of access to flooded and rain-fed rice fields by hippopotamuses and assessed the effect of the installation of electric fences. Hippopotamuses were detected in 54% of the flooded fields (n = 100) and in 31.9% of the rain-fed fields (n = 91). They were detected more frequently in fields on offshore islands than on the mainland, in unfenced than in fenced fields, and in fields closer to running water. Hippopotamuses entered fenced flooded fields less frequently than unfenced, and were detected most frequently at the end of the rainy season and the start of the dry season, and in the period of vegetative stem growth. Electric fences were an effective deterrent and facilitated increased rice production. The maintenance and cost of the electric fencing were acceptable to farmers, and therefore the use of such fencing is recommended to resolve the conflict between hippopotamuses and farmers in Guinea-Bissau and in other areas with similar conditions.","Preventing crop raiding by the vulnerable common hippopotamus <i>Hippopotamus amphibius</i> in Guinea-Bissau",0

Maintaining canopy connectivity through preservation of connecting branches (i.e. natural canopy bridges) may help mitigate that impact. Using camera traps, we evaluated crossing rates of a pipeline right-of-way in a control area with no bridges and in a test area where 13 bridges were left by the pipeline construction company. Monitoring all canopy crossing points for a year (7,102 canopy camera nights), we confirmed bridge use by 25 mammal species from 12 families. With bridge use beginning immediately after exposure and increasing over time, use rates were over two orders of magnitude higher than on the ground. We also found a positive relationship between a bridge's use rate and the number of species that used it, suggesting well-used bridges benefit multiple species. Data suggest bridge use may be related to a combination of bridge branch connectivity, multiple connections, connectivity to adjacent forest, and foliage cover.

Therefore, we designed an experiment to assess feasibility of coyote control as a management action to increase recruitment on B.F. Grant and Cedar Creek Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) in central Georgia, USA. We estimated annual coyote abundance during 2010-2012 using a noninvasive mark-recapture design and fawn recruitment using infrared-triggered camera surveys. During March-June 2011 and March-April 2012, trappers removed coyotes from both sites. Estimates of coyote abundance on B.F. Grant WMA after trapping were 81% (2011) and 24% (2012) lower than during preremoval. Coyote abundance estimates were similar among years on Cedar Creek WMA. Fawn recruitment on B.F. Grant WMA averaged 0.65 fawns/adult female prior to removal and 1.01 fawns/adult female during the 2 years following the removals. Fawn recruitment on Cedar Creek WMA did not differ among years during the study, and was similar to that prior to coyote arrival. The differential coyote impacts and variable effectiveness of trapping we observed on nearby sites suggest coyote control may not achieve management objectives in some areas. Furthermore, transient behavior and the potential for coyotes to adapt to control efforts likely reduce efficacy of this management action. However, we observed an increase in recruitment on B.F. Grant WMA during one year, and others have seen similar responses. Therefore if lowered fawn recruitment is hindering achievement of management objectives, we recommend managers who opt to control coyotes continuously monitor recruitment to determine whether a response occurs.","Whiteâ€tailed deer fawn recruitment before and after experimental coyote removals in central Georgia",0

Percent of coyote sightings in the protected areas was 6 times less than expected during the exclosure period (42% pre-exclosure, 7% exclosure, 47% post-exclosure). We conclude that the electronet fencing was effective for dramatically decreasing coyote activity in focal areas where black-footed ferret litters were being raised.We found evidence that survival of kits living primarily in protected areas was 22% higher, but we qualify this finding because of low sample sizes and because our monitoring activity on the study site may have influenced coyote activity.

In the first year of non-lethal control the combined implementation and running costs were similar to those of lethal control (USD 3.08 per head). However, the mean cost of depredation decreased by 69.3%, to USD 6.52 per head. In the second year of non-lethal control the running costs (USD 0.43 per head) were significantly lower than in previous years and depredation costs decreased further, to USD 5.49 per head.

We used non-invasive genetic sampling, remote trail cameras, and complaint records to evaluate the efficacy of Alberta's intercept-feeding program.

Remote trail cameras detected grizzly bears at all intercept-feeding sites, but detected females with dependent offspring at only 4 of the 12 sites. We reviewed complaint data for incidents before, during, and after the intercept-feeding program.

The movement and behaviour of trained and control bilbies were compared in both a predator-free environment and in an area where cats and foxes were present. Trained bilbies within the predator-free environment moved significantly further, used more burrows with more entrances and changed burrows more frequently than untrained control animals. Trained bilbies also moved burrows when presented with olfactory predator stimuli while control bilbies did not. However, when bilbies were reintroduced to an area where predators were present, there was no difference in survival, movement or burrow use between trained and control bilbies. Both groups exhibited high survival rates in the first 6. months after release. In the presence of predators, both trained and control bilbies appeared to be more predator-aware possibly because of control bilbies learning from trained conspecifics or cohabiting rabbits or through inadvertent contamination of control animals during training.

Modified ski slopes are effectively linear areas of disturbance that separate natural habitat and provide barriers to the movement of native animal species. To overcome these barriers, boulder-filled and culvert-style wildlife crossings have been constructed across disturbed ski slopes and under roadways to facilitate the movement of small native mammal species among areas of remnant habitat, but generally they differ in size and locality. The use of boulder-filled and under-road culvert crossings of different length has not been evaluated. Aims We determine whether fauna utilise wildlife crossings in ski resorts and whether variations in crossing length influence the species using the crossings. Methods We monitored boulder-filled crossings of two size classes (long or short) biannually from March 2009 to April 2013, using hair tubes. We monitored an additional two under-road culvert crossings with remote infrared cameras. Key results The results indicated that all crossings, regardless of size, are utilised by small mammals. However, we detected threatened species, such as Mastacomys fuscus (broad-toothed rat), more frequently in crossings of greater length.

At present there is no evidence that pangolins are being traded from Zimbabwe to China, and the increased enforcement may be key to ensuring Zimbabwe's pangolins are not threatened by the large-scale illegal trade witnessed in Asia.","Taking a stand against illegal wildlife trade: the Zimbabwean approach to pangolin conservation",0

Translocating wildlife is often not a preferred wildlife management technique because of the potential return and repeated capture of animals. Hundreds of bears are translocated in Wisconsin annually, but because anesthetizing, marking, and tracking individual bears is prohibited at the time of year that translocations occur, it is not known whether the same few bears are moved multiple times, or if a large pool of new bears continues to be trapped and translocated. To determine if bears are frequently recaptured, we used genetic techniques to identify translocated bears during 2006 and 2007. Of the 520 bears identified, very few (4%) were recaptured. Of the bears that were recaptured, most (71%) tended to return to within 10 km of their original capture locations. Our inferences relative to the direct cause of low capture rates are limited, but our results show that bears translocated from corn fields are not repeatedly recaptured in Wisconsin. © International Association for Bear Research and Management.","Are the same bears repeatedly translocated from corn crops in Wisconsin?",0

Subsequent monitoring through to 2013 has revealed a small but healthy extant population that occupies all suitable habitat with some animals moving beyond the predator-free sanctuary to adjoining woodland patches. Possums occurred at a low density and had large home ranges relative to other studies at more mesic sites elsewhere. This is likely linked to the low productivity of the site (annual average rainfall of 332 mm) and one-way dispersal of young across the barrier fence. Possums preferentially occupied woodlands of York gum and salmon gum, utilised rock she-oak habitat, but made little use of shrubland and mallee habitats within the sanctuary. Female possums appeared to mature at an early age and to have young for much of the year. Recruitment was biased towards males in the first four years of establishment; although many appeared to rapidly disappear from the population. The success of this reintroduction is most likely linked to the initial release of possums into vacant habitat, the absence of foxes, and the ready availability of hollows in mature eucalypts and shelter sites in rock crevices.","Successful reintroduction of the brushtail possum to Wadderin Sanctuary in the eastern wheatbelt of Western Australia",0

These practices affect multiple biotic and abiotic interactions mainly through loss of habitat and resources available for native wildlife. We examined the effects of local vegetation conditions on resource selection by a small mammal species in drylands with different resource availability. The study was conducted in a semi-arid woodland that included an area protected from livestock grazing and human settlement for more than 50 years, the Man and the Biosphere Ñacunán Reserve, and an adjoining area that has experienced long-term cattle grazing. We tracked radio-collared individuals of Graomys griseoflavus, the most abundant small mammal in the Ñacunán region, and calculated resource selection functions (RSFs) to evaluate habitat selection. We modeled resource selection using a suite of habitat variables measured in both areas. We hypothesized that long-term changes in vegetation associated with livestock grazing would substantially influence habitat selection. G. griseoflavus selected vegetation patches with relatively greater cover of forage species (i.e., taxa commonly consumed) and avoided open spaces; they also selected sites with greater species richness and cover of grasses and trees. Although resource selection patterns were generally similar under both management conditions (i.e., under passive restoration and grazing), the strength of selection was greater in the grazed area. The final RSF model validated well with k-fold cross-validation (R2 = 0.61). Because of the importance of rodents in ecosystem function, management to meet their resource requirements could be an important tool for habitat restoration in degraded drylands.","Influence of grazing management on resource selection by a small mammal in a temperate desert of South America",1

To help ameliorate this decline, green-tree retention (GTR) leaves large live trees after harvest to provide mature forest habitat and increase structural diversity of the regenerating stand. Aims To test the hypotheses (H) that, at 20 years after harvest, (H1) abundance, reproduction and survival of the southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi), as well as (H2) abundance and species diversity of the forest-floor small mammal community, would increase with the basal area (BA) and density of residual trees after harvest. Methods Small mammals were live-trapped in 2015-16 in replicated clearcut, dispersed retention, aggregated retention, patch cut and uncut forest sites in mixed forests of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia) in southern British Columbia, Canada. Key results Mean BA and density of overstory coniferous trees were significantly different at 20 years post-harvest, being higher on patch cut and uncut forest sites than on the clearcut and GTR sites. M. gapperi populations were significantly greater in aggregated retention and uncut forest sites than in the other sites, but demographic parameters were similar among sites, and therefore H1 was partly supported. Mean total abundance of small mammals differed significantly among sites, with the highest overall numbers occurring in the aggregated retention (16.2), clearcut (13.6) and uncut forest sites (11.9). Mean species richness and diversity were highest in the GTR and clearcut sites. Thus, H2 was not supported. Conclusions Recovery of M. gapperi in aggregated retention sites with 10m2 ha-1 BA of residual trees, as a group, occurred at 20 years post-harvest.

Anthropogenic provisioning of food to wildlife is a common practice of unprecedented magnitude worldwide and is of increasing conservation concern. Ungulate supplementary feeding is widespread in game management; however its effects on non-target species have received little attention. Here, we investigate how ungulate feeding affects the movement behavior of a non-target species, the brown bear (Ursus arctos). We tracked bear movements in the Northeastern Carpathians (1500 km2) and inventoried 212 ungulate feeding sites. We analyzed encounter rates of nine GPS-collared bears with ungulate feeding sites (1658 km, n = 49 tracks) and compared them with the corresponding encounter rate of simulated tracks. We also estimated the encounter rate with feeding sites using snow-tracking of unknown bears (232 km, n = 40 tracks). GPS-tracked bears encountered feeding sites three times more frequently (mean ± SE = 0.154 ± 0.022 per km travelled) than would be expected if they were moving randomly (0.054 ± 0.0010 per km random walk). The rate was even higher for snow-tracked bears, which visited on average 0.926 ± 0.271 feeding sites per kilometer travelled. This suggests a link between the winter activity of some individuals and their frequent use of feeding sites. Bears seemed to rely on spatial memory and patrol known sites, independent of whether food was available at the feeding sites. This alteration of the natural behavior of species with behavioral flexibility, such as brown bears, could be interpreted as a sign of environmental degradation. Our results demonstrate an important effect of ungulate feeding on the movement ecology of non-target species. We warn of the impacts of this practice on species and ecosystems and highlight the need to preserve natural movement behaviors and urgently reevaluate management practices involving food provisioning to wildlife.","Supplementary ungulate feeding affects movement behaviour of brown bears",0

In order to mitigate mortality and restore connectivity, wildlife passages are being constructed as linear corridors. The installation of these mitigation measures must be followed by systematic monitoring, in order to evaluate their use and effectiveness, to assist in their management, and to convince stakeholders of their value. In this paper we present the results of a monitoring study of the use of rope overpasses developed near a protected area in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. The canopy bridges were installed by the Urban Monkeys Program in places where electric hazards and road-kills of brown howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba clamitans Cabrera, 1940) were recorded. Camera traps were installed at each bridge, and local people were selected and trained to monitor overpass use over 15 months, from August 2008 to October 2009. Three species were recorded using canopy bridges: brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba clamitans Cabrera, 1940), white-eared opossum (Didelphis albiventris Lund, 1840) and porcupine (Sphiggurus villosus Cuvier, 1823). Rope bridges with the highest number of species recorded had more forest cover and lower urban area around them than overpasses little used. Our results indicate that overpasses, in Porto Alegre, work as a linear corridor between forest remnants, although the outcomes for individual survival, group persistence, population demography or gene flow have not been measured. Furthermore, canopy bridges may be important to mitigate the impact of roads and power lines on wildlife, but electric cables also need to be completely isolated when present, to warrant animals' physical integrity.","Pontes de corda como passagens para animais silvestres em paisagens urbanas fragmentadas",0

Here we use a correlative approach to test for possible effects of a 0.1km2 partial-take MPA (closed to spearfishing for 12.5years) on the abundance and size of key harvested fishes using an asymmetrical spatial comparison of the MPA vs. three unprotected control areas. Positive impacts were detected, despite our prediction that a small MPA would not provide protection to highly mobile taxa.

While benefits of protection were evident, the cost-benefit of implementing similar MPAs should be carefully considered as the partial protection status and small size of the MPA limit both the adequacy of the MPA for protecting a larger range of species, and the magnitude and thus detectability of effects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Enhanced numbers of two temperate reef fishes in a small, partial-take marine protected area related to spearfisher exclusion",0

Habitat features such as percent rocky substrates and depth influenced fish density while reserve status did not. Next, we calculated habitat-based average densities and used the mean log response ratio (RR) of the density inside to outside of RCAs to determine if the amount of fishing outside the RCA, previous fishing history, the age, area or perimeter to area ratio influenced population recovery. Few positive reserve effects were apparent for any species/group. No clear patterns of RR with age were found for the RCAs, which ranged from 3 to 7 years old at the time of sampling (mean = 4.6). In addition, the intensity of fishing, size, and perimeter-to-area ratio failed to explain RR for most species. There were also no differences in size structure (length) of fish between RCAs and unprotected areas.

Over the 5-year study period, CPUE of C. puniceus and C. nasutus in the no-take zone increased as did the mean length of all species, except C. nasutus.

Recent developments in electronic tags and movement modelling offer new information to quantify fine-scale usages of fishery closed areas by free-ranging individuals. Conventional tagging data, on the other hand, inform on population broad-scale distribution patterns with respect to closed areas. Using the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) population from the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence as a case study, we demonstrate how electronic tagging experiments can be supplemented with conventional tagging experiments to evaluate and redesign fishery closed areas. A geolocation model was used to estimate time of arrival, time of departure, and proportion of time that individual cod equipped with data-storage tags spent within a fishery closed area. Two optimization algorithms were developed to seek out the spatial and temporal designs that maximized the proportion of time that the fish equipped with data-storage tags spent inside the closed area, relative to its size and duration. Bootstrap analyses quantified the effects of inter-individual variability in closed area usages. Conventional tagging data were used to estimate the proportion of the spawning population density function encompassed by the closed area. Results from the electronic and conventional tagging experiments suggested that the fishery closed area in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence should be displaced south along the 200-m isobath and that the enforcement period be reduced.

Since 1994, a closed season (April-July) protects spawning aggregations of five grouper species in Palau, and, although this regulation may affect fishers targeting behaviour towards herbivores and increase their catch levels, the extent of these effects was previously unknown. This study conducted market surveys and interviews to examine if the closed grouper season in 2009 had any effect on herbivore spearfishing catches, or caused changes in the targeting behaviour of fishers. Catch volumes of the most desirable herbivores were unaffected by the grouper season, but the catch per unit effort of herbivores regularly caught opportunistically (i.e. if seen) or avoided raised by 45% during the grouper closure. The size composition of the catch of the bluespine unicornfish Naso unicornis during the grouper closure was significantly skewed to smaller sized fish due to the high proportion of immature individuals. Further investigation is required to clarify whether this pattern emerged because fishers had relaxed size selectivity during the closure or due to a paucity of adults in July. Fifty-seven per cent of the interviewed fishers indicated that while groupers would be their first choice during open season, N.unicornis would become their preferred target during the closure, and that other herbivores were also more likely to be targeted. This study took an important step in identifying a factor driving short and acute changes in the herbivore catch composition. Further efforts should be directed to quantify the ecological implications of the observed changes and determine if these are aggravated by the life-history traits or functional roles of the focal species. Relaxed species selectivity might emerge elsewhere, if inherently selective fishing methods are used and highly prized targets are temporarily or permanently banned, or overfished to critical levels.

Seasonal closures have often been implemented in an attempt to alleviate such impacts but the effectiveness of these measures is rarely tested. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a spawning closure for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Firth of Clyde off the Scottish West Coast (ICES Area VIa). This closure was introduced in March 2001 as an emergency measure to allowas many cod as possible to spawn and avoid the build-up of displaced effort from another spawning closure. Genetic, tagging, and otolith microchemistry investigations indicate that cod inhabiting the Clyde are reproductively isolated from other resident groups in the central and northern part of the Scottish WestCoast stock. This study used a beyond-Before-After, Control-Impact approach to compare population trends of the Clyde spawning aggregation before and after the introduced area closure, using two other sub-population spawning grounds as control areas. There was no evidence of local recovery in terms of abundance, biomass, or reduced mortality in the Clyde more than a decade after establishing the closure. Mortality mayhave remained high because young cod are still caught as bycatch in the Nephrops fishery in the area and the predation rate may have increased due to an expanding whiting population. Considering the state of the already severely depleted Clyde sub-population when the closure was implemented the measure appears to have been too little and too late.

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to detect significant differences, before and after the closure, in standardized catch per unit effort (CPUE) at different seasons and sale prices at home/closed and neighbour/open ports. ANOVAs showed significantly higher CPUE after the closure for total landings and Mullus spp. of the Red mullet métier, Merluccius merluccius CPUE (in two years) and the total landings of the Norway lobster métier. On the contrary, significant lower values were observed after the closure for total CPUE (in early summer) and Aristeus antennatus of Red shrimp métier. Similar CPUE was observed at all levels when the closure took place in late summer. In economic terms, market prices of target species have decreased or shown no changes after the closure at home/closed and neighbouring/open ports. The only exception was the significant increase of the price for A. antennatus in Dénia during the closure in La Vila Joiosa. Depending on its timing, the closure would highlight some positive biological effects on some target species. However, closure leads to an unavoidable reduction in most of target species prices.

The survey domain covered 326km2, comprised of eight reef habitats in four management areas that offered different levels of resource protection: the Tortugas North Ecological Reserve (a NTMR), Dry Tortugas National Park (recreational angling only), Dry Tortugas National Park Research Natural Area (a NTMR), and southern Tortugas Bank (open to all types of fishing). Surveys detected significant changes in population occupancy, density, and abundance within management zones for a suite of exploited and non-target species. Increases in size, adult abundance, and occupancy rates were detected for many principal exploited species in protected areas, which harbored a disproportionately greater number of adult spawning fishes. In contrast, density and occupancy rates for aquaria and non-target reef fishes fluctuated above and below baseline levels in each management zone. Observed decreases in density of exploited species below baseline levels only occurred at the Tortugas Bank area open to all fishing. Our findings indicate that these NTMRs, in conjunction with traditional fishery management control strategies, are helping to build sustainable fisheries while protecting the fundamental ecological dynamics of the Florida Keys coral-reef ecosystem. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Assessing coral reef fish population and community changes in response to marine reserves in the Dry Tortugas, Florida, USA",0

Tracking the changes of a fish community following a megascale reclamation and ensuing mitigation measures. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 1206-1219.A fish community in Hong Kong that had experienced megascale reclamation in Chek Lap Kok International Airport, and the ensuing marine protected areas (MPAs) establishment was tracked for 12 years. Significant shifts in community structure, typified by 17 species, were revealed by multivariate analyses and community metrics. Dynamic factor analysis disclosed two underlying common trends among them and their significant correlations with changes in water quality, area of seabed disturbance, and area of MPAs. A time-lag for detectable community changes was also revealed. During reclamation, the fish density was low and community health was poor. Large species disappeared leaving a community dominated by small, fast-growing and young-to-mature species. After completion of reclamation, some large and medium species returned, but soon after the establishment of MPAs, medium-sized, fast-growing and young-to-mature species thrived on reduction of fishing pressure, and filled the guilds rapidly. Therefore, even though fish density and community health were improved, the original community structure was not restored.

Few studies, however, have been designed explicitly to test how these factors influence the abundance trajectories of key species within sanctuaries. Diver surveys on reef habitat were conducted within a subtropical marine park in eastern Australia, to test for differences in abundances of targeted fishes between sanctuaries differing in size and age and compared with fished zones. Four management zones were sampled: (i) small sanctuaries established 1991 (<15 ha of reef and <200 m wide); (ii) large sanctuaries established 2002 (>100 ha of reef and > 500 m wide); (iii) zones which allowed recreational fishing but not commercial fish trapping (>200 ha of reef); and (iv) zones which allowed both recreational fishing and commercial fish trapping (>200 ha of reef). Multiple sites in each management zone were sampled for selected taxa eight times during the austral winter from 2002 to 2012. Many of the targeted taxa examined were more abundant in large sanctuary sites within a few years of the establishment of protection compared with the small sanctuary sites and the fished sites. Red morwong Cheilodactylus fuscus increased in large sanctuaries but were more abundant in the older smaller sanctuaries throughout the study. Similar increases were not observed in fished zones. There was considerable variability among years not associated with management type, including a peak in abundance for several species in 2005 and reduced abundance of many taxa following a destructive storm in 2009.

Fish were visually censused in shallow rocky habitat (4-7 m depth) at replicate sites within the different MPA zones and in adjacent unprotected areas. Higher values of sea breams size, density and biomass were usually observed inside MPA compared to unprotected areas, likely due to the enforcement of protection.

Fish density and biomass decreased abruptly just 100. m outside the MPA and remained close to zero off the western boundary. A partial recovery in fish density was recorded eastward, about 1 km apart from the MPA boundary.

In a management context, it is critically important to clarify the role apex predators play in structuring populations of lower trophic levels. Thus, we examined the top-down influence of reef sharks (an apex predator on coral reefs) and mesopredators on large-bodied herbivores. We measured the abundance, size structure, and biomass of apex predators, mesopredators, and herbivores across fished, no-take, and no-entry management zones in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. Shark abundance and mesopredator size and biomass were higher in no-entry zones than in fished and no-take zones, which indicates the viability of strictly enforced human exclusion areas as tools for the conservation of predator communities. Changes in predator populations due to protection in no-entry zones did not have a discernible influence on the density, size, or biomass of different functional groups of herbivorous fishes. The lack of a relationship between predators and herbivores suggests that top-down forces may not play a strong role in regulating large-bodied herbivorous coral reef fish populations. Given this inconsistency with traditional ecological theories of trophic cascades, trophic structures on coral reefs may need to be reassessed to enable the establishment of appropriate and effective management regimes.","Impact of conservation areas on trophic interactions between apex predators and herbivores on coral reefs",0

Potential benefits of a partially protected marine area for fishes was investigated by comparing the species richness and abundance of commercially important fishes in this area with those in a fully protected area and adjacent unrestricted fishing ground in San Miguel Island, eastern Philippines. Fishing is forbidden in the fully protected area. Fishing activities in the partially protected marine area and open fishing area were also investigated through interviews with local fisherman. Species richness and abundance in the completely protected zone were significantly higher than those in the partially protected and open fishing areas; however, no difference was found between the partially protected and open fishing areas. Similarly, fishing pressure indices (e.g., fishing time, catch, and gear type) between the partially protected and open fishing areas were not different. Overall, full protection of a marine area confers greater benefits than partial protection; however, under high fishing pressure, partially protected areas are rendered less effective than an open fishing zone.

However, despite recent advances in our understanding of trophic cascades, evidence is often circumstantial on coral reefs because fishing pressure frequently co-varies with other anthropogenic effects, such as fishing for herbivorous fishes and changes in water quality due to pollution. Australia’s outer Great Barrier Reef (GBR) has experienced fishing-induced declines of apex predators and mesopredators, but pollution and targeting of herbivorous fishes are minimal. Here, we quantify fish and benthic assemblages across a fishing-induced predator density gradient on the outer GBR, including apex predators and mesopredators to herbivores and benthic assemblages, to test for evidence of trophic cascades and alternative hypotheses to trophic cascade theory. Using structural equation models, we found no cascading effects from apex predators to lower trophic levels: a loss of apex predators did not lead to higher levels of mesopredators, and this did not suppress mobile herbivores and drive algal proliferation. Likewise, we found no effects of mesopredators on lower trophic levels: a decline of mesopredators was not associated with higher abundances of algae-farming damselfishes and algae-dominated reefs. These findings indicate that top-down forces on coral reefs are weak, at least on the outer GBR. We conclude that predator-mediated trophic cascades are probably the exception rather than the rule in complex ecosystems such as the outer GBR.","A test of trophic cascade theory: fish and benthic assemblages across a predator density gradient on coral reefs",0

Fishes were surveyed using one hour deployments of baited remote underwater video stations twice at each site over consecutive days. We show that although the estuarine reserves in Moreton Bay contain a significantly different fish community, they fail to enhance the abundance of harvested fish species. We posit that performance is limited because reserves protect unique spatial features, or conserve narrow estuaries with weak connections to mangrove habitats and the open sea. Consequently, reserves as currently positioned protect only a subset of potential environmental conditions present for fish within the region, and potentially support residual estuarine habitats (i.e. expansive intertidal flats or shallow creeks) which are not particularly significant to either fish or fishers. We argue that reserve effectiveness can be improved by conserving deeper estuaries, with diverse habitats for fish and strong connections to the open sea. Without incorporating these critical spatial considerations into estuarine reserve design, estuarine reserves are doomed to fail.","Enhancing the performance of marine reserves in estuaries: Just add water",0

Our analysis at the species level showed that most species increased in density inside reserves and that the fish response was greater than that of the invertebrate response, which was more variable.

Corkwing wrasse were tagged (n=1057) during (May-June) and after (July) the spawning period in 2014 within a no-Take site and in a nearby site open for fishing. We monitored the fishery within and nearby the tagging sites from June to October and sampled recaptures on all commercial fishing trips.

Sharks were more abundant within the Reserve, which also accommodated a greater proportion of smaller size classes. Although there was no difference in linear growth-rate between sharks inside and outside the Reserve, those outside exhibited higher condition factor values. It is suggested that these results are due mainly to habitat preference on the part of the sharks, with the predominantly shallower near shore waters of the Reserve offering a greater level of protection from predation.

Further, marine reserve effectiveness might be low for mobile species if the size of the reserve is less than a species usual range, reducing the overall time a individual may be protected.

Overall, 50% of the total detections in the study occurred inside marine reserves containing large seagrass beds (>7.09 m 2) and in close proximity to mangroves (<7.47 km).

After harvest, Acanthuridae FID in periodically harvested closures increased significantly to beyond the maximum effective range of spearguns.

Acanthuridae biomass in the periodically harvested closures was similar to fished areas, and lower than in the no-take reserves. There was no difference post-harvest for either total or Acanthuridae biomass.CPUE was higher for fishing trips inside the periodically harvested closures than regular fishing activities. Fishes were generally larger in catches from periodically harvested closures, but this was not sufficient to account for the increase in CPUE, particularly of the Acanthuridae, which were significantly more abundant in the harvest catch.When fishes are protected temporarily from fishing, their wariness decreases, which makes them more easily catchable when fishing is reinstated.

Weak or missing management institutions, a lack of research capacity, and the complex nature of these ecosystems have heralded a call for ecosystem-based management approaches. However, ecosystem-based management of coral reef fisheries has proved challenging due to the multispecies nature of catches and the diversity of fish functional roles. We used data on fish communities collected from 233 individual sites in 9 western Indian Ocean countries to evaluate changes in the site's functional composition and associated life-history characteristics along a large range of fish biomass. As biomass increased along this range, fish were larger and grew and matured more slowly while the abundance of scraping and predatory species increased. The greatest changes in functional composition occurred below relatively low standing stock biomass (<600 kg/ha); abundances of piscivores, apex predators, and scraping herbivores were low at very light levels of fishing. This suggests potential trade-offs in ecosystem function and estimated yields for different management systems. Current fishing gear and area restrictions are not achieving conservation targets (proposed here as standing stock biomass of 1150 kg/ha) and result in losses of life history and ecological functions. Fish in reefs where destructive gears were restricted typically had very similar biomass and functions to young and low compliance closures. This indicates the potentially important role of fisheries restrictions in providing some gains in biomass and associated ecological functions when fully protected area enforcement potential is limited and likely to fail. Our results indicate that biomass alone can provide broad ecosystem-based fisheries management targets that can be easily applied even where research capacity and information is limited. Of particular value, is our finding that current management tools may be used to reach key ecosystem-based management targets, enabling ecosystem-based management in many socioeconomic contexts.","Biomass-based targets and the management of multispecies coral reef fisheries",0

Closure from fishing was predicted to result in the recovery of predatory fish and herbivores, herbivory rates, and subsequently reduce erect algae and lead to the recovery of herbivore resistant and calcifying taxa such as hard corals and calcifying algae. Recovery of predatory fishes was the largest response to closure and the herbivore response was weak and no corals and calcifying algae changed in the predicted direction. Hard corals declined where they were most abundant and all sites appear to have reached a stable point of ~15% cover by the end of the study. Generalized and possibly opportunistic carnivores, such as jacks, barracuda, groupers, snappers, grunts, and sparids showed the greatest increases and there was a trend towards more small-bodied herbivores such sea urchins and damselfish in the open and a slight gain in large herbivores in the closed area, but this had little effect in increasing total herbivory. Factors that may have influenced this unexpected response include: (1) a complex food web that did not produce a simple cascade response; (2) attenuation of the cascade effect towards the lower trophic levels; (3) insufficient compliance, closure time, and space; (4) a post- rather than pre-disturbance establishment of the closure; 5) habitat or site specificity; and (6) overriding environmental disturbances, such as oceanographic oscillations and a warming climate.

While many studies have demonstrated that marine sanctuaries increase the abundance, diversity, and trophic level of marine fish communities, few have compared these parameters across multiple levels of protection and human modification. This study utilized baited remote underwater video to compare fish assemblages between marine parks, between different levels of protection within parks (sanctuary and habitat protection zones), and between parks and highly modified systems with similar ecological communities. It was demonstrated that sanctuary zones have higher abundance of targeted fish species compared with other areas within some marine parks. The total abundance of targeted species and abundances of some key fisheries species (e.g. pink snapper) were found to be higher in sanctuary zones. This suggests that increased protection may be effective at improving these aspects of the fish assemblage. However, when marine parks were compared with highly modified environments it was found that targeted species were much more abundant in the highly modified systems. Community composition of entire fish assemblages also differed between these levels of modification and economically important fisheries species contributed most to this difference. These findings suggest that while highly protected sanctuary zones may increase the abundance of targeted fish compared with less protected areas within the same estuary, highly industrialized or urbanized systems, not typically chosen as marine parks, may actually support more targeted species of fish. It was demonstrated that forms of modification in addition to fishing pressure are having large effects on fish assemblages and productivity. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Putting marine sanctuaries into context: a comparison of estuary fish assemblages over multiple levels of protection and modification",0

In this study, we assessed the assemblages of seven commercially important coral reef fish families (Acanthuridae (excluding genus Zebrasoma), Labridae (subfamily Scarinae only), Lutjanidae, Serranidae (subfamily Epinephelinae only), Mullidae, Haemulidae and Lethrinidae) inside and outside MPAs in 37 coastal municipalities in the Philippines.

Overall, reef fishes inside MPAs were more diverse than outside MPAs based on Shannon-Wiener index of diversity. Reefs inside MPAs had an average of four more fish species than outside MPAs. Both inside and outside MPAs had comparable equitability values which are characterized by fish communities that are largely dominated by few species only. Higher fish densities, especially fishes with =25cm (total length), were also recorded inside MPAs.

Bumphead parrotfish are an iconic threatened species and may be a useful surrogate for multispecies conservation. They move across tropical seascapes throughout their life history, in a pattern of habitat use that is shared with many other species. We examined their value as a conservation surrogate and assessed the importance of seascape connectivity (i.e., the physical connectedness of patches in the seascape) among reefs, mangroves, and seagrass to marine reserve performance. Reserves were designed for bumphead parrotfish, but also enhanced the abundance of other species. Integration of local ecological knowledge and seascape connectivity enhanced the abundance of 17 other harvested fish species in local reserves.

Herbivorous fish play a key role in coral reef seascapes. By removing algae, they promote coral growth and recruitment, and help to increase resilience. We examined how connectivity with mangroves affected herbivore populations and benthic succession on reefs in eastern Australia. We surveyed fish assemblages, examined reef composition and characterised benthic recruitment on reefs at multiple levels of connectivity with mangroves, in a no-take reserve and areas open to fishing. Our results show that connectivity enhanced herbivore biomass and richness in reserves, and that these connectivity and reserve effects interacted to promote herbivory on protected reefs near mangroves. Connectivity and reserve protection combined to double the biomass of roving herbivorous fish on protected reefs near mangroves.

The removal of high-order consumers by fishing has both direct and indirect effects that can lead to important changes in the strength of trophic interactions. Although the effects of marine protection on biological interactions are beginning to be understood, our knowledge is largely restricted to shallow-water assemblages. However, depth gradients are also characterised by significant differences in the intensity of trophic linkages, and these may be interacting with any effects derived from protection. In this study, the individual and combined effects of depth and marine reserve protection on predation and herbivory were determined across 3 regions in the NW Mediterranean (Catalunya, Mallorca and Menorca) using juvenile urchins and palatable algae as bioassays. Marine protection did not strongly influence fish herbivory, which generally decreased with depth. We found no evidence of depth-related changes in predation rates or the size of predatory fishes, but there was a strong effect of protection on predation rates that was only consistently observed across regions in shallow water (5 m depth), but not at greater depths (15 and 30 m).

Monitoring programmes based on the perceptions of resource users are often presented as a cost effective alternative to understanding the status and changes in resource and socio economic conditions. Ecological, catch landings and perception-based data, and their collection methods, have different benefits and limitations for community-based programmes. Here we present a study of the first community-based, co-managed area in the Kingdom of Tonga - the small island of ‘O'ua. We examine both perception-based data from interviews and catch landings data to describe fishing activities, catches and changes in resource status and socio economic conditions since the inception of co-management. Landings data were collected by the community over a five year period; perceptions of change and management performance were collected through structured interviews with fishers based on the same time period. The majority of fishing within the ‘O'ua co-managed area was by men, using hand spears in fibreglass vessels <5 m in length powered by an outboard engine. We found that catch per unit effort was high (especially the estimates generated from perception data) compared to other parts of the Pacific. Since the inception of co-management fishers reported improved socio economic conditions, a greater sense of stewardship over resources, active involvement in management and the effective exclusion of ‘outside’ fishers. We compared catch and catch-per-unit-effort estimates generated from landings and perception data. While fishers perceived that catches had improved since the inception of co-management, landings data suggested that catches were either stable or declining.

A total of 8674 fishes landed in Karimunjawa by fishers using four artisanal fishing gears were examined to understand how the condition of the artisanal fishery (standard and infinite fish length, trophic level and weight) related to fishing gear use, village fishing grounds, management, human population size, human population density and estimated fishing pressure. Depletion in fish lengths and trophic structure were found at or above 46 fishing trips day-1km-2, suggesting that fishing pressure is a key factor driving fishery catch structure.

Results of tethering experiments and the strong negative correlation found between predation rate and prey density strongly suggest that predation controls sea urchin populations.

The interaction between habitat condition and fishing pressure is primarily due to the high abundance of small bodied planktivorous fish on fished reefs. However, the influence of management zones on the abundance and biomass of predators and target species is small, implying spatial differences in fishing pressure are low and unlikely to be driving this interaction. Our results emphasise the importance of habitat in structuring reef fish communities on coral reefs especially when gradients in fishing pressure are low. The influence of fishing effort on this relationship may however become more important as fishing pressure increases. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Relative and combined effects of habitat and fishing on reef fish communities across a limited fishing gradient at Ningaloo",0

Here, we investigated the influence of partial protection - excluding fixed gears such as gillnets and traps but still allowing a hook and line fishery - on the demography of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. To do so, we applied novel multi-event models to a 9-year data set containing both live recaptures and dead recoveries of marked fish of different sizes collected before and after the implementation of an MPA, also including several unprotected sites. At the MPA site, the annual proportion of deaths due to fishing decreased from 0·59 before MPA implementation to 0·32 after MPA implementation. As a result, annual survival increased by 167% (from 0·09 to 0·24) for small (16-44 cm) and 83% (from 0·23 to 0·42) for big (45-97 cm) cod, respectively. Average survival was lower in unprotected areas, and annual fishing mortality was higher, representing almost 100% of the total mortality of large-sized cod in some years. Annual emigration rates (i.e. spillover from the MPA) increased in the last years of the study, but no differences in body growth were detected between sites. Closure of the fishery within the MPA would further increase the annual survival of smaller individuals by 100% (from 0·24 ± 0·07 to 0·48 ± 0·11) and that of larger individuals by 44% (from 0·42 ± 0·05 to 0·60 ± 0·09). Synthesis and applications. Our study reveals how current marine protected areas (MPAs) function and provides important insights for guiding a future adaptive management process.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are used increasingly as conservation tools around the world, but how they benefit mobile and wide ranging species like sharks remains unclear. To evaluate the degree of protection MPAs may provide for sharks, we used an array of acoustic receivers to examine the movements and spatial use of two tropical coastal species within two MPAs in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. Juvenile pigeye (. Carcharhinus amboinensis) and adult spottail (. Carcharhinus sorrah) sharks were fitted with acoustic transmitters from 2009 to 2010. Both species displayed long-term use of MPAs, with some individuals detected for longer than 600. days. The mean percentage of time . C. . amboinensis and . C. . sorrah spent inside MPAs was 22% and 32%, respectively. MPA use varied seasonally, with . C. . amboinensis spending a higher percentage of time inside MPAs in summer (mean. =. 28%) and . C. . sorrah spending a higher percentage of time inside MPAs in winter (mean. =. 40%). Although sharks used large areas inside MPAs, most individuals tended to use only half of the available protected space. In addition, all sharks made excursions from MPAs and individuals exited and re-entered at consistent locations along the MPA boundaries. These results demonstrate that MPAs have conservation benefits for shark populations by providing protection across different species and life stages, and tracking studies can be used to help tailor MPA design to maximize effectiveness. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Evaluating marine protected areas for the conservation of tropical coastal sharks",0

The incidental fishing mortality of species with low reproductive rates, such as elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays), is recognized as a key threat for their populations. In the present study, gear modifications related to the type of hook and position of the hook in the water column were tested to examine their effects on catch rates and mortality of elasmobranch species in both pelagic and coastal environments. Comparisons between circle (size 18/0, 0° offset) and J-style (size 9/0, 10° offset) hooks demonstrated that the circle hooks have a greater efficiency in reducing the mortality of most species caught, both in pelagic and coastal longline fisheries. Internal lodging of the hook was significantly less frequent for the individuals caught with circle hooks, which likely contributed to their higher survival rate at haulback. Additionally, circle hooks also increased the CPUE of elasmobranchs caught in the pelagic longline fishery, which was particularly evident for Carcharhinus falciformis and Prionace glauca. The position of the hook in the water column exhibited a strong influence on the species caught in the coastal bottom longline fishery. Suspending hooks in the middle of the water column reduced the bycatch of common demersal species, such as Carcharhinus acronotus, Ginglymostoma cirratum, and Dasyatis americana, while increasing the CPUE of potentially aggressive species, such as Galeocerdo cuvier and Carcharhinus leucas. The interaction of the type of hook utilized with its position in the water column appears to be an essential factor in the optimization of longline selectivity and minimization of bycatch mortality. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Fishing gear modifications to reduce elasmobranch mortality in pelagic and bottom longline fisheries off Northeast Brazil",0

Commercial power hand-line fishing was permitted to continue on productive seamount fishing grounds within the reserve because new information enabled boundaries and zoning proposed in the reserve's draft Management Plan to be revised and consistent fisheries regulations to be formulated. The draft plan would have removed access to fishing grounds that provide approximately 25% of the annual regional Australian total allowable catch of the premium fishery species, Blue-eye Trevalla (Hyperoglyphe antarctica). Day-time power handline fishing in 280–550 m depths on Taupo and Barcoo Seamounts avoided Harrisson's Dogfish (Centrophorus harrissoni) – the primary species of conservation concern – because the shark is a diel vertical migrator, residing deeper than Blue-eye during the day before ascending to shallower depths at night to feed on micronekton. Harrisson's Dogfish occurs on several other seamounts where it was previously unrecorded. These results, together with expectation of low mortality of any incidental dogfish bycatch and low impacts on benthic habitats, supported changes to management arrangements which preserve the seamount Blue-eye fishery worth approximately A$1M annually whilst protecting more seamounts and greater areas of benthic habitat in the restricted 200–700 m depth range. Research uptake was facilitated by clarifying policy options at a critical stage in the planning process. This required having clearly articulated management objectives that aligned conservation and fishery imperatives, involving knowledgeable fishers in making robust field observations to address specific knowledge gaps and management needs, and identifying the requirements for ongoing fishery monitoring that addresses remaining management uncertainties. This potential to identify win-win outcomes in the Australian marine planning process provides some general signposts for future policy decisions as marine reserve networks are implemented and reviewed, and for scientists wanting to effectively engage in decision-making processes.","Selective commercial line fishing and biodiversity conservation co-exist on seamounts in a deepwater marine reserve",0

Identifying how different components of capture influence the condition of discarded fish can help develop specific guidelines and best handling practices. Using an experimental approach, we modified the severity of capture stressors in commercial purse seine fisheries for Pacific salmon and monitored indices of injury and reflex impairment in chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), a species commonly discarded from these fisheries. Study fish were held for 5 or 10 days. Modeling of changes in injury and impairment sought to disentangle the latent effects of capture stressors and the role of sex and maturity. Thresholds in physiological responses to times (i) pursed in the net and (ii) air exposed on deck were also evaluated. Injury progressed throughout holding, was more extensive in females, and accelerated faster in less mature fish. Both crowding severity and set size (i.e. estimated number of fish caught) increased injury and impairment, effects that were exacerbated with time pursed. Physiological indicators of exhaustion also increased with time pursed and 15 min was identified as an important transition point, potentially representing the temporal limit to anaerobic exercise. The time between 1 and 3 min of air exposure was identified as being important to survival, and after 6 min of air exposure, endogenous energy stores may have become exhausted. Resulting recommendations include keeping nets loose during sorting, releasing fish prior to 15 min of being pursed, and keeping air exposure within the range of 1–2 min, or less. Additionally, females and less mature fish appear to be more susceptible to the injurious effects of capture.","Experimental capture and handling of chum salmon reveal thresholds in injury, impairment, and physiology: best practices to improve bycatch survival in a purse seine fishery",0

The duration and severity of post-release impairments have rarely been studied under natural conditions; the vitality of animals is usually assessed aboard a vessel, prior to release, while examinations of post-release behaviour are usually restricted to what is within view of a vessel. In this study, we quantified the post-release behavior of the common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus), two species of emperor (Lethrinus spp.), and the Spanish flag snapper (Lutjanus carponotatus), each of which is actively fished throughout the Great Barrier Reef. SCUBA divers followed fish in the field and recorded their behavior with underwater video cameras after a simulated catch-and-release event. Relative to a low stress treatment (held in an aerated tank prior to release), fish exposed to forced exercise and 5 min of air exposure spent more time in vulnerable positions after release, including 5.8× more time immobile under the boat upon release, 1.6× more time to reach the reef floor, and 2.4× longer to reach the protection of the reef. The effects of the catch-and-release simulation on tailbeat frequency, ventilation rate, and the proportion of overall time spent immobile were not significant except in L. carponotatus, which spent significantly more time immobile when exposed to the high stress treatment. Indeed, there were some notable differences among species, with the magnitude of the behavioural impairments being lower and less variable in coral trout than in Lethrinus spp. or L. carponotatus.

Accounting for post-release mortality is therefore essential to total fishing mortality estimates, stock status and management of this group of fishes. However, despite a presumed species-specific range in tolerance, few studies have investigated the short-term post-release mortality among skates indigenous to the western North Atlantic following capture by mobile fishing gears, and never in the Gulf of Maine. This study addresses this shortfall for the prohibited thorny skate, Amblyraja radiate and smooth skate, Malacoraja senta, and the targeted winter skate, Leucoraja ocellata, and little skate, Leucoraja erinacea. Of 1288 skates evaluated, negligible immediate mortality was observed at the time of capture, even in relation to the largest catches and/or most prolonged tows. However, injury frequency was moderate, with highest levels in the smooth (60%) and thorny (52%) skates. Aside from the smooth skate (59%), 72. h mortality rates were low overall (19% across all species when accounting tow durations indicative of the fishery), with the winter skate (8%) exhibiting the lowest levels. Logistic regression modeling revealed tow duration as the most universal predictor of condition and 72. h mortality, while catch biomass, sex, temperature changes, and animal size also held influence in certain species.

Hook location was found to be the best predictor of survival, with the survival of throat- or stomach-hooked pearl perch significantly (P< 0.05) lower than those hooked in either the mouth or lip. Post-release survival was similar for both legal (=35. cm) and sub-legal (<35. cm) pearl perch, while those individuals showing no signs of barotrauma were more likely to survive in the short term. Examination of the swim bladders in the laboratory, combined with observations in the field, revealed that swim bladders rupture during ascent from depth allowing swim bladder gases to escape into the gut cavity. As angled fish approach the surface, the alimentary tract ruptures near the anus allowing swim bladder gases to escape the gut cavity. As a result, very few pearl perch exhibit barotrauma symptoms and no barotrauma mitigation strategies were recommended. The results of this study show that pearl perch are relatively resilient to catch-and-release suggesting that post-release mortality would not contribute significantly to total fishing mortality.

Rays were caught during summer, with a ‘hotspot’ (24.3% of sets) near the shelf edge off North Island over seabed depths of 150–350 m. Rays were usually brailed aboard with the tuna catch from successful sets, but were often entangled in the bunt of the net during unsuccessful sets. Observers tagged nine rays with popup archival tags to obtain preliminary information on their post-release survival, and spatial and vertical movements. Seven of the nine tags reported data, and four of those rays died within 2–4 days of release. All four rays that died had been brought aboard entangled in the bunt. The three surviving rays were all brailed aboard with the tuna catch. One surviving ray remained near New Zealand for 2.7 months during summer, and the other two migrated 1400–1800 km northward to tropical waters near Vanuatu and Fiji at minimum speeds of 47 and 63 km day-1 at the end of summer. Archive data from one ray showed that it made regular vertical movements of 25–100 m amplitude, but spent most of its time shallower than 50 m, more so during the night (89.6%) than the day (76.6%), and mainly experienced temperatures of 18-22 °C.

Recommendations are made for reducing purse seine mortality of mobulid rays by avoiding areas of high ray abundance, avoiding setting on ray-associated tuna schools, and adopting best-practice methods of returning rays to the sea from the net or vessel.

Whale sharks are occasionally encircled in tropical tuna purse-seine nets, throughout this global fishery. Although apparent immediate survival rates following encirclement and release have recently been assessed through scientific onboard observer programmes, a more rigorous methodology is still required for studying post-released survival. 3. This work provides a method for applying pop-up satellite tags and reports an enhanced release procedure for whale sharks. The first assessment of survival after release from purse-seine nets involved six whale sharks tagged between May and September 2014 in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. Five tags transmitted data: three popped up as programmed (after 30 days), while two surfaced prematurely (one after 21 and the other after 71 days (programmed to pop off after 30 and 90 days, respectively)) but showed no sign of unusual behaviour. 4. Overall, whale sharks survived at least 21 days (one at least 71 days) after release from purse-seine nets. These observations based on five large individuals (total length > 8 m), suggest that whale sharks have a good chance of survival when released with the proposed method. 5. Additional tagging in this and other oceans, especially of juveniles which may be more sensitive to encirclement and release operations, is essential to further assess whale shark post-release survival rates in tuna purse-seine fisheries.

In the Northwest Atlantic, blue sharks (Prionace glauca) account for most of the bycatch in the Canadian pelagic longline swordfish fishery. Minimizing the capture of this species is of interest to conservationists as well as the fishing industry because the high incidence of shark bycatch negatively affects fishing operations through bait loss and increased handling time. Electropositive metals (e.g., lanthanide) oxidize in seawater and create electric fields, which can alter the swimming and feeding behaviors of several species of sharks. Although electropositive metals appear to have the potential to reduce shark bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries, there have not been any controlled trials reported from a commercial fishery. A total of 7 sets (6300 hooks) with 3 hook treatments (standard hooks, hooks with electropositive metals (neodymium/praseodymium), and hooks with lead weights) were deployed in 2011 on the Scotian Shelf in the Northwest Atlantic. The results of this study show that electropositive metals did not reduce the catch of blue sharks or other common shark bycatch species, and hence do not present a practical bycatch mitigation measure for the Canadian longline fishery. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","No effect from rare-earth metal deterrent on shark bycatch in a commercial pelagic longline trial",0

Recently, the naturally electrogenic lanthanide metals have been introduced as an elasmobranch-specific repellent. We quantified the voltage produced by six lanthanide metals in seawater, compared their dissolution rates, and performed a behavioral assay to determine their efficacy against two coastal shark species. We found that there was no difference in the voltage produced by the six tested metals and the voltage decayed as a power function (approximately x-1.5) with distance from the metal sample. We calculated that sharks should detect a sample of neodymium from a distance of 65-85cm in seawater. Voltage was greatest in freshwater and decreased logarithmically with increasing salinity but did not differ above salinities greater than 10ppt. The dissolution rate for the lanthanides varied from -1.6 to -0.2gh-1 and as the metals dissolved, the voltage remained constant.

Although not a major contributor to S. mokarran mortality, beach nets are utilized in several locations to minimize the potential harmful interaction between sharks and beachgoers. To address this mortality, permanent magnets have been employed to determine if these materials can deter sharks away from netted areas. The present study examined the effects of barium-ferrite (BaFe12O19) permanent magnets on S. mokarran behavior under several environmental and biological conditions. In the bait experiment, feeding frequency significantly decreased and avoidance frequency significantly increased with the magnet treatment, with exposure quantity yielding an increase in feeding frequency, although this effect was not statistically significant. For the barrier experiment, entrance frequency significantly decreased and avoidance and pass-around frequencies significantly increased with the magnet treatment, with heterospecific density also being a significant pre - dictor of entrance frequency. The findings demonstrate how permanent magnets can modify S. mokarran behavior and how this behavior is modified based on situational context. Since several other sphyrnid species are caught in beach nets more frequently than S. mokarran (e.g. scalloped hammerheads S. lewini), the present results may serve as a model for these other sphyrnid species and illustrate the potential conservation implications of future magnetic deterrent barrier technologies.","Effects of barium-ferrite permanent magnets on great hammerhead shark <i>Sphyrna mokarran</i> behavior and implications for future conservation technologies",0

In an effort to reduce rates of bycatch, researchers have tested various deterrents that could benefit fisheries. Permanent magnets are one promising form of bycatch reduction device, yet their efficacy has only been tested for hook-and-line fisheries with variable results. Here, we examined the potential benefits of permanent magnets on an ocean fish trap fishery targeting snapper (Pagrus auratus) where more than 10% of the total catch is comprised of unwanted elasmobranchs and the presence of elasmobranchs reduces the catch of target species. Over 1000 fish traps were deployed in a fishery-dependent survey in New South Wales, Australia. Standardised catch rates indicate that the incorporation of magnets into fish traps significantly reduced incidences of elasmobranch bycatch (mainly Brachaelurus waddi) by over a third, while increasing the amount of target fish caught by an equivalent amount. Together these results suggest that magnets can be used as an effective bycatch reduction device that reduces incidences of elasmobranch bycatch while increasing the profitability of fish traps for fishermen. Future studies should aim to replicate these results in areas where different species of elasmobranchs occur.","Permanent magnets reduce bycatch of benthic sharks in an ocean trap fishery",0

A wide variety of by-catch reduction devices (BRDs), that is, modified gears designed to reduce incidental captures of a variety of marine species while maintaining target catch rates, have been proposed, but the extent to which BRDs actually reduce the risk of catching sharks and rays remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of 27 publications that reported the capture of sharks and rays and, in some cases, of targeted teleosts in longline gear deployed with and without BRDs. The risk of shark and ray capture differed between types of BRDs, but only one BRD type, longlines raised off the bottom, reduced by-catch significantly. Circle hooks did not reduce the risk of capturing sharks and rays but might improve discard survival and are inexpensive, which might make them effective in reducing the detrimental effects of longlining on these species. In addition to being generally ineffective, some devices, such as electropositive and magnetic repellents, are expensive and have inherent construction drawbacks that are likely to make them unsuitable for commercial use. Overall, most BRDs did not affect the likelihood of catching targeted teleosts, but a substantial number of studies did not adequately assess target catch. We identified two poorly studied classes of BRD gear (i.e. raised demersal longlines, and monofilament nylon leaders), which represent promising directions for future research.","Do by-catch reduction devices in longline fisheries reduce capture of sharks and rays?

Consequently, a codend mesh size increase in the Loligo fishery has been proposed as a management measure to minimize discarding of butterfish and other bycatch species. A paired-tow study was conducted using a Loligo twin trawl to assess the effects of a codend mesh size increase, from 50. mm to 65. mm (inside stretched mesh), on catch rates and size selection of the target and bycatch species. Relative mesh selection factors estimated from a SELECT model were: 1.7, 1.5, 2.2, and 3.0 for L. pealeii; P. triacanthus; Illex illecebrosus (Northern shortfin squid); and Merluccius bilinearis (silver hake), respectively. Catches of butterfish and silver hake in the 65. mm codend were reduced by 58% and 41% in terms of numbers, respectively. However, a larger mesh size would be necessary to allow 50% escapement of the median sizes of mature silver hake and butterfish. A trade-off associated with the bycatch reductions is a 29% loss in the catch weight of the target species. However, the reduction in ex-vessel value of Loligo catch is probably not proportional to the percent loss in Loligo catch because most of the loss consisted of squid from the smallest market size categories which have the least value and are primarily discarded. In addition, a greater percentage of large, more valuable squid was caught in the 65. mm codend. The September study results likely represent a worst-case scenario with respect to Loligo catch loss because the monthly mean body size of Loligo tends to be smallest during September. Most catches of the three bycatch species evaluated herein and Loligo smaller than 10. cm are discarded, most likely dead, in the Loligo fishery. Therefore, a codend mesh size increase to 65. mm should provide some conservation benefits to these stocks if a portion survive escapement.

Such a model is developed for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) through a meta-analysis of 21 trials of codend selection and 19 trials of the combined selection of the codend and a square mesh panel. Individual-haul estimates of the 50% retention length (l50) and the selection range (SR) are related to a set of explanatory variables through a structural model that describes the dual process of panel and codend selection. Codend l50 and SR are positively related to codend mesh size and negatively related to the codend twine diameter. Codend l50 is also negatively related to the number of open meshes around the codend circumference. Panel l50 increases with panel mesh size. The panel contributes more to gear selection as it is moved closer to the codline. The panel is most effective between November and January and least between May and July, periods which broadly coincide with peak and poor haddock condition.

Bigeye and yellowfin tuna showed significantly higher rates of survival at the time of gear retrieval with circle hooks, and circle hooks hooked bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, swordfish, and sailfish significantly more often externally than internally.

Pelagic fishing at seamounts, where hyperstability of pelagic predators may occur, can exacerbate declining abundance and have high bycatch of species groups that are highly vulnerable to overexploitation. Generalized additive mixed Poisson regression models (GAMMs) were fitted to Hawaii longline tuna fishery observer data to determine temporal trends in standardized catch rates, an index for local, relative abundance. Temporal trends in expectile length distributions were determined through geoadditive expectile GAMMs. Significant declining trends in relative abundance in this fishery were observed for tunas, sharks and billfish. A decline in seabird standardized catch rate occurred concurrently with the uptake of seabird bycatch mitigation technology. Changed spatial distribution of fishing effort and increased use of wider circle hooks likely contributed to a declining sea turtle standardized catch rate. Tuna and billfish mean lengths significantly increased over the time series due to entire distributions of length classes having shifted towards larger fish. Larger tunas comprised a larger proportion of the catch due to fewer small tunas being caught, and to a lesser extent because mean lengths of larger size classes increased. Conversely, billfish largest length classes experienced the largest increases in average lengths. Changes in spatial and seasonal distributions of fishing effort, increased use of wider circle hooks, and possibly increasing purse seine selective removals of juvenile tunas, may have contributed to increased selectivity for larger fish. Significant differences in standardized catch rates and length distributions at a shallow seamount vs. the open ocean confirms the aggregating effect of seamounts on pelagic predators, including juvenile market species of pelagic fish and species groups relatively vulnerable to overexploitation.

In total, 310 longline experimental sets (446 400 hooks) were deployed between October 2008 and February 2012. Three different hook styles were tested; the traditional J-hook (9/0) 10o offset was compared with two 17/0 circle hooks (a non-offset and a 10o offset), and squid (Illex spp.) bait was compared with mackerel (Scomber spp.). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was calculated for each fish species per fishing set and compared between the different hook style and bait type combinations. Results indicated that the effects of hook style and bait on the CPUEs were species-specific. For example, swordfish (target species, Xiphias gladius) CPUEs were higher with J-hooks baited with squid, while for the blue shark (most important bycatch species, Prionace glauca) the highest CPUEs were obtained with circle hooks baited with mackerel. For tuna (Thunnus spp.) and marlin (blue, Makaira nigricans and white, Kajikia albida) only the bait effect was significant, with higher catches with squid. For the discarded species, the proportions of alive vs dead specimens at the time of fishing gear retrieval were also species-specific. The total retained catch value per unit of effort (VPUE) did not changed between the different hook and bait combinations, but these VPUEs are highly dependent on market fluctuations.","Effects of 17/0 circle hooks and bait on fish catches in a Southern Atlantic swordfish longline fishery",0

Individual and synergistic effects on elasmobranch catch and survival from pelagic longline gear factors, including methods prescribed to mitigate bycatch of other vulnerable taxa, were determined. Overall relative risk of higher circle vs. J-shaped hook shark catch rates conditioned on potentially informative moderators, from 30 studies, was estimated using an inverse-precision weighted mixed-effects meta-regression modelling approach. Sharks had a 1.20 times (95% CI: 1.03–1.39) significantly higher pooled relative risk of capture on circle hooks, with two significant moderators. The pooled relative risk estimate of ray circle hook catch from 15 studies was not significant (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.89–1.66) with no significant moderators. From a literature review, wire leaders had higher shark catch and haulback mortality than monofilament. Interacting effects of hook, bait and leader affect shark catch rates: hook shape and width and bait type determine hooking position and ability to sever monofilament leaders. Circle hooks increased elasmobranch catch, but reduced haulback mortality and deep hooking relative to J-shaped hooks of the same or narrower width. Using fish vs. squid for bait increased shark catch and deep hooking. Pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) catch and mortality were lower on wider hooks. Using circle instead of J-shaped hooks and fish instead of squid for bait, while benefitting sea turtles, odontocetes and possibly seabirds, exacerbates elasmobranch catch and injury, therefore warranting fishery-specific assessments to determine relative risks.","A cross-taxa assessment of pelagic longline by-catch mitigation measures: conflicts and mutual benefits to elasmobranchs",0

Although longline fishing is characterised by low energy consumption, low bycatch of non-target species and high catch quality, bycatch of undersized fish has been found to be a problem in some fisheries. We studied the effects of bait size and hook size on catching efficiency and size selectivity in the Icelandic longline fisheries targeting cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), tusk (Brosme brosme), ling (Molva molva) and wolffish (Anarhichas lupus). Five sizes of EZ-Baiter hooks (sizes 10 - 14) and two sizes (10 and 30 g) of Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) bait were tested in six fishing trials. There was a significant size selectivity effect for bait size in that larger bait caught more large fish and fewer small fish of all species, apart from ling. The large bait caught 45, 56, 35 and 76% more (by weight) cod, wolffish, tusk and ling, respectively. Haddock catches were reduced by 57% when the large bait was used. Increasing hook size lowered capture efficiency for all species, but had only a minor effect on size selectivity. Our results thus demonstrate that hook size and bait size affect the profitability of longline fisheries, in that smaller hooks improve capture efficiency, while larger baits increase catches of large fish and reduce those of undersized fish.","The effects of hook and bait sizes on size selectivity and capture efficiency in Icelandic longline fisheries",0

Catch data were fitted to generalized linear models to identify potentially significant explanatory variables. With a nominal catch rate of 0.610 elasmobranchs per 1000 hooks, a total of 27 species of elasmobranchs were captured, 48% of which are categorized as Threatened under the IUCN Red List. Sharks and rays made up 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively, of total fish catch. Blue sharks and pelagic stingrays accounted for 51% and 99% of caught sharks and rays, respectively. There was near elimination of ‘shark lines’, branchlines set at or near the sea surface via attachment directly to floats, after 2011. Of caught elasmobranchs, 35% were finned, 11% had the entire carcass retained, and the remainder was released alive or discarded dead. Finning of elasmobranchs listed in CITES Appendix II was not observed in 2014. There were significantly higher standardized shark and ray catch rates on narrower J-shaped hooks than on wider circle hooks. Based on findings from previous studies on single factor effects of hook width and shape, the smaller minimum width of the J-shaped hooks may have caused the higher shark and ray catch rates. For sharks, the effect of hook width may have exceeded the effect of hook shape, where small increases in shark catch rates have been observed on circle vs J-shaped hooks. Shark and ray standardized catch rates were lowest in the latter half of the year. Focusing effort during the second half of the year could reduce elasmobranch catch rates.

Results were compared from 65 sets from six commercial fishing vessels totalling 50 800 hooks in which ringed and non-ringed 16/0 circle hooks with a 10° offset were alternated along the length of the longline. In total, 464 individuals were caught in the 4 years of experiment, with swordfish (Xiphias gladius) comprising 83% of the total number of animals captured. Catch rates of targeted swordfish were significantly higher on ringed hooks (CPUEringed hooks = 8.465, CPUEnon-ringed hooks = 6.654). Results indicate that ringed circle hooks captured significantly more small-sized swordfish than non-ringed circle hooks (27.7% vs. 19.5%, respectively). For species with sufficient sample sizes, the odds ratio (OR) of a capture was in favour of ringed hooks; significantly for swordfish (OR = 1.27 95%CI 1.04–1.57), and not significantly for bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) (OR = 1.50, 95%CI 0.68–3.42) nor for pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrigon violacea) (OR = 1.13, 95%CI 0.54–2.36). All six loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and three of the four blue sharks (Prionace glauca) were captured on ringed hooks, however, the small sample sizes prevented meaningful statistical analysis. In summary, results from this study suggest that the addition of a ring to 16/0 circle hooks confers higher catchability for small-sized commercial swordfish, and does not significantly reduce catch rate of bycatch species and protected species in a Mediterranean shallow pelagic longline fishery. These findings should motivate fisheries managers to consider factors in addition to hook shape when aiming to promote sustainable fishing practices.

Data from 42 empirical studies were analysed using a random effects model to compare the effects of circle hooks and J-hooks on catch rate (43 species) and at-vessel mortality (31 species) of target and bycatch species. Catch rates with circle hooks were greater for 11 species, including four tuna species, six shark species and one Istiophorid billfish. Catch rates on circle hooks were lower for seven species, including two Istiophorid billfishes and two species of sea turtle. At-vessel mortality was significantly lower with circle hooks in 12 species, including three tuna species, three Istiophorid billfishes, swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and three shark species. No species had significantly greater at-vessel mortality when captured with a circle hook rather than a J-hook. While our general approach increased model variability compared to more detailed studies, results were consistent with trends identified in previous studies that compared the catch rates and at-vessel mortality (between hook types) for a number of species.

Size of maturity ranged from 105 to 118mm CL with 90% of reproductive potential coming from size classes above 105mm CL. SOM generally tended to increase from east to west and indicated that while the current MLS of 105mm CL may be appropriate for Marine Fishing Areas (MFAs) in the eastern part of the fishery, a higher MLS (>110mm CL) should be considered for MFAs in the western region of the zone. As size of maturity is age, rather than size dependent, these results may reflect differences in growth rates and highlight the importance of considering spatial variation in reproductive characteristics when applying size limits to lobster resources. Escape gap effectiveness was examined by estimating catch rates of undersized lobsters and commonly caught bycatch species, before and after mandatory introduction in 2003.

The devices included reductions in trap opening sizes and novel bent-tunnel openings. Reducing trap opening size did not affect bycatch rates of rockfish or other non-target fish species. In contrast, bent-tunnel BRDs eliminated rockfish bycatch, and two of the bent-tunnel variants also excluded other fish species. However, prawn catch rates were reduced in all modified gear, and large prawns were often excluded more than small prawns.

The discrepancy in the selection efficiency estimates for perch probably depends on an uncertainty in the extrapolation, because of the variation in escape rate across time periods. Perch and roach differed in time of day for escapes. For perch most escapees was seen in the evening, and for roach most fish escaped at night, probably reflecting the general activity cycles of the two species. Over a fishing season, several thousands of fish would be able to escape from each trap, and an increase in the use of size selection grids could potentially be an efficient tool for fish population management.","The efficiency of selection grids in perch pontoon traps",0

The 38.1 mm mesh trap was the control trap type. Back panel traps are the minimally legal mesh configuration in this region while 50.8 mm mesh traps are commonly used in this fishery to further reduce culling of sub-legal black sea bass by fishers. Two previously untested mesh sizes, 57.2 and 63.5 mm, were evaluated because a previously published morphometric relationship between black sea bass body depth and total length (TL) predicted that the diagonal openings of these two respective mesh sizes would retain black sea bass close to the current (279 mm) and proposed minimum TL limits (305 mm). We estimated size selection of each experimental trap type by comparing catches of control and experimental traps. All but the back panel trap displayed relatively steep selection around the fish length at which 50% of individuals were selected (l50). Initial size at retention (l10) by the 57.2 and 63.5 mm trap types were nearly identical to current and proposed minimum fish sizes, respectively. Predictions from the body depth: TL relationship were very similar to estimates of l10 and l50, based on uncompressed body depth and compression to 93%.

Pot fishing has lower environmental impact and fuel consumption than most other fishing methods. However, pots typically have low capture efficiency for most ground-fish species, and efforts to develop effective commercial pots are needed. Bycatch of red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) is a severe problem in the coastal fishery for cod (Gadus morhua) in the Barents Sea. In a previous publication, we demonstrated that cod pots floated off the bottom eliminated this problem. Our original bottom-set cod pot has two entrances in order to increase the rate of entry of fish, but when this pot is floated, fish that search for food by following chemical cues up-current will only encounter the entrance that is oriented down-current. We therefore compared the catch rates of floated pots with one and two entrances, and predicted that the new design with only one entrance would achieve higher catch rates due to a lower rate of escape. Pots with one entrance caught significantly more cod and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) than pots with two entrances. The catch rate of cod above minimum landing size (=44 cm) of pots with one entrance was 82% higher than that of pots with two entrances. Pots that were snagged and did not float properly caught large numbers of king crab. The larger catches of pots with one entrance could be explained by lower escape rate from this design. The observed difference in catch rates between the two pot types indicates that more than 50% of the large cod and haddock that entered the pot with two entrances escaped. There is therefore great potential for increased catching efficiency of pots through improved pot design.","Floated cod pots with one entrance reduce probability of escape and increase catch rates compared with pots with two entrances",0

However, these nets are currently not permitted for fishing this species because they potentially capture large amounts of bycatch in a sensitive ecological zone. Hence, the primary goal of this study was to design and assess the effectiveness of a novel bycatch reduction device (BRD) installed on traditional fyke nets.

Four different codends were used in the sea trials. The nominal mesh sizes tested were 48. mm and 56. mm and two different nominal circumferences were associated with each mesh size. Selectivity experiments were carried out in the Central Adriatic Sea, in the course of two different periods of the year (May and September 2005) on two different fishing grounds normally exploited by local fishermen. Reliable selectivity results were obtained for red mullet (Mullus barbatus), little squid (Alloteuthis media) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius). For all the species, the codend circumference plays a role which is as important as mesh size. The positive effect of increasing mesh size, from 48. mm to 56. mm, could be made fruitless by an increase in codend circumference. According to species, the change only in the mesh size from 48. mm to 56. mm significantly increases L50 by +15-42%, while by increasing only the codend circumference of around 13-17%, L50 decreases by 9-41%, thus being effective as by increasing mesh size. As a consequence the selection factor (i.e. SF is the ratio of L50 and the codend mesh size) depends on the codend circumference and does not result mesh-size-independent. We confirm that it is not sufficient to regulate selectivity in multispecies fisheries just by setting a minimum mesh size and that there is a need in mixed fisheries to improve selectivity by using additionally mechanisms. Possible solution would be to design policies and management programmes that seek to minimise discards, which include active rather than static management, obligations to land all catches, and no MLS and reduced benefits from landings of juvenile fish. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Effect of mesh size and codend circumference on selectivity in the Mediterranean demersal trawl fisheries",0

Other debris (lighter pieces of wood) and benthic fish (bridled gobies, Arenigobius bifrenatus) were not as greatly mobilised (i.e. reduced by 50 and 25%, respectively); possibly due to their position on or slightly off the bottom, and a similar influence of hydrodynamic displacement by the hydro-vane surface areas.

Despite protective measures, they remain vulnerable to bycatch by fisheries, especially bottom-trawls and pose a problem for fisheries management measures that aim to eliminate discards in the future. In the mixed-species bottom-trawl fisheries of the North Atlantic catches can be increased by fitting a length of chain known as a ""tickler"" in front of the groundgear of the trawl. It was hypothesized that the tickler is especially effective at catching skates and rays that may otherwise escape beneath the net. A trial was undertaken with paired tows with and without the tickler chain. The trial demonstrated that the catch rate of skates and sharks can be significantly lowered by removing the tickler. A set of secondary nets (groundgear bags) attached behind the groundgear of the main net allowed the number of fish escaping under the net to be estimated and showed that the reduction of skates and sharks in the main net was accompanied by an increase in number in the groundgear bags. This suggests that prohibition of the use of tickler chains in areas that are known to be especially important to skates and sharks could have conservation benefits. The removal of the tickler chain had little effect on catch rates of haddock, whiting, and flatfish, but caused a marked decrease in the catch rate of commercially valuable anglerfish.","A simple technical measure to reduce bycatch and discard of skates and sharks in mixed-species bottom-trawl fisheries",0

An inherent challenge in such fisheries is to provide both biologically and economically sustainable exploitation of individually fluctuating stocks and vessel- or fleet-specific quotas. The topless trawl design was developed to improve species-specific selectivity in such fisheries. In a topless trawl, the foot rope is located more forward than the headline to allow fish to escape upwards, whereas the headline is located in front in traditional trawl designs. In this study we conducted twin trawls with a topless trawl towed parallel to a similar standard trawl; we tested a topless trawl design on a small trawl with a low headline height and on a larger trawl with a high headline height. We conducted the tows in the Nephrops (Nephrops norvegicus) directed mixed fisheries. For both the small and large trawls, we found a significant topless effect for haddock (Melanogramus aeglefinus) and no effect for Nephrops. For Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) we found a significant topless effect for the low headline trawl but no effect for the high headline trawl. In both the eastern and western Atlantic, topless trawls have been introduced as legal cod-selective trawl designs. However, this study demonstrates that identical gear modifications made to similar trawls of different sizes and used in the same fishery can lead to different results.","Species selectivity in different sized topless trawl designs: Does size matter?",0

Previous studies using topless trawls (i.e. trawls with a headrope more than 20% longer than the footrope) in this region showed reductions of cod, but also reductions in species of flatfish. In May and June 2011, we tested a topless trawl on a commercial trawler with a much greater headrope to footrope ratio and greater flotation than previous studies in the region. Thirty haul-pairs were successfully conducted and demonstrated a 51% reduction in the catch of cod, with no significant loss of any flatfish species, except for a significant loss of sublegal American plaice. Our results suggest that a topless trawl can be an effective method of cod avoidance for fishermen in the region, without substantial loss of landable flatfish. We infer from the results that: cod rise in response to an approaching trawl footrope and sand cloud; headrope layback may not be a critical value in the effectiveness of topless trawl designs; and, headrope flotation, particularly in the center of the headrope, may be an important factor in retaining flatfish.","Avoidance of Atlantic cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>) with a topless trawl in the New England groundfish fishery",0

High fuel consumption, seabed disturbance and high discard rates are well-known disadvantages of this fishing technique. These shortcomings are increasingly gaining international public and political attention, especially with the upcoming discard ban in Europe. The most promising alternative fishing technique meeting both the fisherman's aspirations, and the need for ecological progress is pulse fishing with electrotrawls. Here, the mechanical stimulation by tickler chains or bobbins is replaced by electrical stimulation resulting in reduced bottom contact, fuel costs and discards. Although a significant amount of research has been done on electrotrawls and their impact on marine organisms, most data were published in very diverse sources ranging from local non-peer-reviewed reports with a limited distribution to highly consulted international peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, there is a clear need for a comprehensive yet concise and critical overview, covering and summarizing all these data and making these available for the scientific community. This article aims to meet the above goals by discussing the working principle of electric fields, the history of electrotrawls and their current application in the North Sea and impact on marine organisms.

In New South Wales, Australia, a codend comprising a posterior section made from 35-mm square-shaped mesh (i.e. hung on the bar) was developed and subsequently recommended for partial implementation in a multi-species demersal trawl fishery (i.e. for use when eastern king prawn - Melicertus plebejus - is the primary target species). However, industry concerns over this design have to date prevented its implementation. Here, using direct twin-tow comparisons onboard a subset of the fleet, we quantitatively assessed the performance of the square-mesh codend, relative to the range of diamond-mesh codend designs currently being used, in terms of reductions in bycatch rates and shortfalls in catch rates of retained animals. Generalised linear mixed-effects modelling across all vessels showed that when eastern king prawn was the target species, the square-mesh codend significantly reduced bycatch rates (by ~48%), but with an accompanying significant shortfall in catch rates of eastern king prawn (~7%) and a substantial (though not statistically significant) shortfall in catch rates of an important component of the retained byproduct (whiting, Sillago spp., ~36%). Partitioning of data by vessel revealed that such shortfalls in retained catch were evident for only some vessels, while the square-mesh codend performed as intended for the others. When school prawn (Metapenaeus macleayi) was the target species, substantial shortfalls in catches of school prawn (~54%) in the 35-mm square-mesh codend confirmed that a codend of a smaller square mesh might be a more appropriate design under those circumstances. Potential strategies to address intra-vessel inconsistencies in performance of the square-mesh codend and thereby facilitate implementation of square-mesh codends in the fishery are discussed. © 2012.","Assessment of relative performance of a square-mesh codend design across multiple vessels in a demersal trawl fishery",0

The total mean bycatch rate was comparatively low (1114.0gha-1 from the standard diamond mesh codend), mainly because of the relatively deep waters associated with the fishery.

Eight models were considered to describe the size selective performance of the T0 and T90 codends for each species; four traditional models, along with four models that considered contact probability (the fraction of fish that will not make proper contact with the codend meshes for size-dependent escape). Fifteen hauls were completed in the North Sea, fishing both codends simultaneously. The results demonstrated that the T90 codend significantly increased size selectivity for the two roundfish species investigated, whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and pouting (Trisopterus luscus), and significantly decreased size selectivity of the three flatfish species, sole (Solea solea), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), and dab (Limanda limanda). Selection range (SR) values were similar for both roundfish species with each codend, but were significantly reduced for all flatfish species by the T90 codend. Models that considered contact probability provided the best model for four of the species with T90 (pouting, sole, plaice, and dab), and one species with T0 (sole). Lack of adequate contact with the T90 meshes could be a result of the combined effects of increased flow through the T90 codend due to T90 meshes remaining more open than T0 meshes during towing, and the relative high towing speeds of beam trawls. This study concludes that although a T90 codend reduces the size selectivity of flatfish, the lower SR of the T90 codend could be paired with a larger T90 codend mesh size for improved flatfish selectivity, and that a T90 mesh codend increases the size selectivity for commonly encountered roundfish in the Belgian beam trawl fishery.","Could a T90 mesh codend improve selectivity in the Belgian beam trawl fishery?",0

Generalized linear models were built for catches, discards, and landings of Nephrops and hake, controlling for the other factors which drive the variability in these variables. A dorsal square-mesh panel meant to let small hake escape did not affect hake catch, but was found to decrease Nephrops catches and discards. Among the devices intended to reduce Nephrops discards, the flexible grid was the most efficient, as it decreased catches and discards in large proportions while increasing landings but this result was supported by a small number of observations; a larger mesh size in the codend (80 mm instead of 70) slightly decreased Nephrops discards; and a ventral square-mesh panel was not found to affect catch or discards of either species.

The experiments were carried out over three separate cruises aboard two commercial Basque bottom otter trawlers in the Bay of Biscay area. ""Fall-through"" experiments were also undertaken to estimate the potential size selection of 100 mm square mesh for the same species. Results from the ""Fall-through"" experiments and the at-sea selectivity cruises demonstrated that a 100 mm SMP has the potential to enable undersized and immature individuals to escape through the meshes. However, the selectivity cruises demonstrated that in practice, the SMP was largely ineffective at releasing undersized individuals as only a small fraction of the fish entering the trawl attempted to escape through the SMP during their drift towards the codend. The fraction attempting to escape was quantified by the ""SMP contact probability"" and was less than 4% for hake and red mullet and less than 15% for pouting. Furthermore, for each species, the release potential for the diamond mesh codend was found to be significantly lower than the length-at-maturity and the legal minimum conservation reference size. On average, the proportions of the total catch of undersized individuals of each species retained by the gear, were 52%, 17% and 45% for hake, pouting and red mullet respectively.

At present, only a raised footrope trawl (RFT) or drop-chain-only trawl (DOT) (in New England, it is specifically called ""sweepless trawl"") in conjunction with a Nordmøre-style grid can be used to land silver hake with small mesh off the coast of Maine.

There was no significant difference in the predicted mean catch of silver hake between trawls (although the LMBW trawl had a 13.50% reduction). Additionally, there was no difference in catch for commercial-size silver hake (>20. cm) between the two trawls. Both video and length analysis determined that small silver hake were caught less frequently by the LMBW trawl.

Based on the results, we were able to explain why the BACOMA codend, applied in the Baltic Sea cod directed trawl fishery, releases juvenile cod efficiently, whereas other designs, including a square mesh panel with similar mesh size, are less efficient. Our main findings reveal that the release efficiency of the square mesh panel in the BACOMA codend depends largely on the overlap of the square mesh panel and the catch-accumulation zone in the codend, where cod do not have the option of just drifting further back in the trawl when proximate to the panel. On the contrary, the reduction in panel size by 50% did not significantly affect the release efficiency when the panel overlapped with the catch-accumulation zone. It was possible to stimulate an escape response for cod to achieve a release through a square mesh panel positioned away from the catch-accumulation zone. Our findings demonstrated that this release was as efficient as for a panel mounted in the catch-accumulation zone of the codend.

Mortality by trawling is mainly due to enforced apnoea during towing activity. In order to reduce the submergence time and consequent turtle mortality, a specific technical modification was developed in the early 1980s: the Turtle Excluder Device (TED). In this paper, we field-tested a typical Supershooter TED and three new types of low-cost TED, built with different designs and materials, incorporating aspects of US and Australian TEDs, as well as design features to improve handling and catch rates. The performance of the TEDs was investigated under commercial fishing conditions in diverse trawling grounds in the Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean). All TEDs were easy to operate and did not require changes to normal fishing operations. Due to lack of entry of turtles it was not possible to evaluate the ability of the different TEDs to release turtles, but one large loggerhead turtle (C. caretta) was captured during the experimental tows and was successfully excluded by the Supershooter. The TEDs reduced anthropogenic debris and, consequently, sorting operations on board.

In order to reduce bycatches of shark we tested an excluder grid with 90. mm bar spacing during experimental fishing in the Tyrrhenian Sea (Western Mediterranean). Data collected made it possible to simultaneously evaluate catch losses of two commercial species: Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster) and Phycis blennoides (greater forkbeard). The escape outlet ahead of the grid and the codend were both mounted with a cover in order to collect escaped fish ahead of the grid and through the codend meshes. We used a structural model to estimate the contribution of the individual selective processes consisting of the excluder grid and the size selective codend. The 90. mm excluder grid did not prove to be efficient in excluding G. melastomus, while it excuded more of P. blennoides. Catches of N. norvegicus were also affected by the presence of the grid, but not as much as the catches of other two species. The results obtained for the experimental grid. +. codend setup were then compared with the estimated selectivity for the ""codend alone"" setup. Furthermore, by way of explorative simulation with other grid bar spacing, we concluded that reducing the grid bar spacing to 70. mm would provide better compromise between the reduction of G. melastomus as bycatch and the catch rate of P. blennoides and N. norvegicus.","Selective characteristics of a shark-excluding grid device in a Mediterranean trawl",0

Three species of valuable fish - Scomberomorus commerson, Otolithes ruber, and Pampus argenteus were selected for selectivity analysis. For each of the three commercial fish studied, less individuals smaller than the minimum landing size (MLS) were retained in the experimental codends of both BRDs. The average exclusion rate of individuals smaller than MLS was calculated to be 47% and 32% for Nafted plus fisheye and Nordmore grid respectively. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test detected a significant difference (P<0.05) in the length frequency of S. commerson, O. ruber and P. argenteus caught in the control and experimental codend of both BRDs. For S. commerson, O. ruber and P. argenteus fish length at 50% retention (L50) and selection range (SR) differs little between Nordmore grid and Nafted plus fisheye. Selectivity curves of both BRDs for three commercial fish indicated that the recorded L50 values were smaller than MLS values. The results have shown that Nordmore grid and Nafted in combination with fisheye have a reductional effect on bycatch of the juveniles of commercial fish species.

Grids are very selective, but they can lead to loss of landable Norway lobster and valuable fish species. To improve retention of these species, we developed three new grids using made by polyurethane to make them flexible: One grid had horizontal bars, one had vertical bars, and one had vertical bars and a guiding funnel in front of the grid.

Water flow around the grid bars was measured in a flume tank. The three grids were tested from a commercial trawler in the Kattegat and Skagerrak area. Underwater filming was conducted to assess grid performance and fish behavior. Results showed that a bottom hole in the lower part of the grid allowed species in the lower part of the gear to pass and retained in the bag behind the hole. More flatfish passed the grid with horizontal bars compared to that with vertical bars, but the retention rate was still low.

Selective fishing gear, such as bycatch-reduction devices (BRDs), can significantly decrease bycatch and discards in shrimp trawl fisheries. The roller-frame trawl, a type of gear unique to Florida, is used in seagrass beds to harvest food shrimp and bait shrimp. No BRD is required for roller-frame trawls, although bycatch can be significant. We tested the effectiveness of two BRDs - the Florida fisheye (FFE) and the large-mesh extended-mesh funnel (EMF) - in reducing bycatch in roller-frame trawls. Tests were conducted at two Florida locations: the nearshore waters off Tarpon Springs, where food shrimp are harvested, and Biscayne Bay, where bait shrimp are harvested. At Tarpon Springs, each device was tested independently and with the addition of a stimulator cone; the cone was not tested at Biscayne Bay. We tested each BRD configuration using a paired trawl design; a BRD-equipped net was deployed off one side of the boat, and a control net with no BRD was deployed off the other side of the boat. The effectiveness of the BRD configurations in retaining shrimp while reducing bycatch varied considerably. Although some significant species-specific reductions were observed in the FFE, that BRD did not significantly reduce overall finfish bycatch, but it did retain shrimp. The EMF performed well, but only at Tarpon Springs. Bycatch reduction was significant, albeit low, and shrimp loss was low. At Biscayne Bay, both bycatch and shrimp loss were significantly reduced in the EMF. Use of the stimulator cone with the FFE and the EMF resulted in significant bycatch reduction but also significant shrimp loss.

The nested cylinder bycatch reduction device (NCBRD), developed using laboratory behavioral studies (Parsons and Foster, 2007; Parsons et al., 2012), was herein evaluated for reducing bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries and for its application in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GOM) fishery. We examined the efficacy of the NCBRD for retaining shrimp, for reducing total bycatch, and for reducing bycatch of juvenile red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), a species that is presently over-fished in the GOM. Using paired trawling on-board leased, commercial fishing vessels, shrimp catch, total bycatch, and the catch of red snapper juveniles were compared from trawls equipped with an NCBRD and control trawls without. Depending upon configuration, trawls with an NCBRD captured about 46-100% of shrimp taken in controls, reduced total bycatch by 26-60% and, of particular note, reduced red snapper bycatch by about 50%. When catch rates were compared, 2.29 (±0.38 s.e.)snapper/h/trawl were taken with an NCBRD and 6.11 (±0.93 s.e.)snapper/h/trawl without, a highly significant (ANOVA, P=0.0032, F=9.39, d.f.=1, 64) effect. Finally, using only red snapper captured in control trawls, we observed a significant effect of depth on red snapper capture with decreasing numbers of red snapper captured with increasing depth. In waters south of Galveston shallower than about 55m, catch rates ranged from 4.5 to 23.4snapper/h/trawl and in deeper water ranged from 0.3 to 2.4snapper/h/trawl.

Although Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) for teleost fish and Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) are now widespread in tropical shrimp trawling, information on their ability to mitigate bycatch of elasmobranchs, particularly rays (Batoidea), is scarce and limited to only a few isolated fisheries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of trawls fitted with a square-mesh panel BRD and super-shooter TED in reducing ray bycatch. In this study, 65 catch-comparison hauls were conducted in the Atlantic seabob shrimp (. Xiphopenaeus kroyeri) fishery off Suriname. Trawls with a BRD and TED combination reduced ray catch rate by 36%. A 21% reduction in mean size indicated the preferential exclusion of large rays. Hence, high escape ratios were observed for Dasyatis geijskesi (77%), a large-sized species, while exclusion of the small species Urotrygon microphthalmum was not significant, although their disc width is small enough to pass through the meshes of the BRD. Furthermore, a size-dependent escape for the two most abundant mid-sized ray species Dasyatis guttata and Gymnura micrura was observed. Exclusion-at-size differed for both species, however, likely related to species-specific morphology or behavior in response to the TED. This study shows that the combination of BRD and TED causes an important reduction in ray bycatch in seabob shrimp fisheries off Suriname. The great reduction in catch of large-sized rays is positive, but the mortality of juvenile rays is likely to have negative consequences for their populations. We therefore recommend gear-based and non-gear adaptations to further reduce the bycatch of small-sized rays.","Ray bycatch in a tropical shrimp fishery: do bycatch reduction devices and turtle excluder devices effectively exclude rays?",0

The adoption of the Nordmøre Grid since the early 1990s has significantly reduced finfish bycatch in the fishery, but a small portion of juvenile fish continues to be caught and discarded. To further reduce finfish bycatch, flume tank tests and sea trials were carried out on a radically modified Nordmøre-style grid.

We estimate that most of the escapement in the combined selection system (consisting of a 55-mm grid and a diamond mesh codend) happens through the grid. We demonstrated that for one of the two grid systems investigated the increase in size selection obtained experimentally by increasing grid-bar spacing is well in line with what could be expected based on the morphology of redfish. However, the size selection observed experimentally was significantly lower than the size-selective potential of the grids estimated based on the morphology of redfish.

The size selectivity results obtained from the analysis of the two sea trials differed significantly, even though they were conducted using grid sections with similar bar spacing that previously were shown to have similar selective properties for other species. The differences were not caused by differences in the ability of the fish to contact the grid. Instead, these differences can be explained by differences in the ability of the fish to turn before they attack the grid.

This study combined in-net and onboard (774 day trawls and 1320 day trawl hours of subsurface observer coverage) electronic monitoring on all fish-trawl vessels (n = 3) to compare bycatch mitigation performances among nine megafauna groups, based on escape rates and interaction durations for three BRDs over 6 months (June to December 2012). Overall, 26.9% of day trawls had no megafauna interactions and 38.3% of the 1826 interactions escaped, with most in rapid time (91.4% in = 5 min). The upward inclined exclusion grid significantly improved the escape proportions for most chondrichthyans by 20-30%.

Although burn severity did not affect most species groups, occupancy of Myotis species and tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) was lower in sites that received moderate severity burns than in sites that received low severity burns. Therefore, while prescribed fire may provide vegetative structure conducive to efficient foraging for all bats of the Cumberland Plateau, our results demonstrate that retaining some unburned forests while creating mosaics of lower and higher severity burns across the landscape will result in favorable foraging conditions for all resident bat species.","Effects of fire and its severity on occupancy of bats in mixed pine-oak forests",0

Habitat fragmentation affects bats during their daily movements between roosts and foraging areas. As bats are protected in Europe, developers must implement specific mitigation measures that are hierarchically structured to achieve a null net impact. However, very few specific mitigation measures have been undertaken specifically for bats. Bat overpasses (e.g. gantries) are among proposed improvements intended to reduce the impact of roads, but they have rarely been tested. The effectiveness of overpasses in facilitating safe road crossing of bats is critical for justifying the implementation of this mitigation measure. We therefore assessed whether bat overpasses are effectively used by bats. We studied three bat overpasses with different designs in France. We developed an innovative method to characterize bat crossings using acoustic flight path reconstruction (AFPR). We used six pairs of stereo acoustic recorders in different habitat types that were located on both sides of the road, and operated simultaneously throughout the night. Recording data contained 57,941 bat passes and 284 bat crossings from six species of bats at the three study sites. Our results suggest that crossings are more numerous if an overpass is located where bat commuting routes have been identified by environmental impact assessment. However, we found that the proportion of bat crossings along the commuting route was the same with or without an overpass; thus highlighting that bat overpasses do not fully restore habitat connectivity. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that acoustic flight path reconstruction (AFPR) is a useful approach to obtain information on bat flight behaviour. We also emphasize the importance of field testing the effectiveness of mitigation measures, such as those intended to offset the impact of roads on biodiversity, and highlight that such measures should not be implemented based on their theoretical effectiveness alone.","Bat overpasses: An insufficient solution to restore habitat connectivity across roads",0

Bats are an ecologically significant group within North American forests, and the diversity of this group includes species that may benefit or suffer negative impacts from habitat changes initiated by prescribed fires. To determine how fire affects a rare bat species that specializes on gleaning moths from forest vegetation, we studied home ranges and nocturnal habitat selection in Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) in an upland forest ecosystem where small-scale, low-to-moderate intensity prescribed burning occurs in spring. We found home ranges of big-eared bats to be notably small (x = 169 ha; n = 41), not different in size among sexes and reproductive classes, and located nonrandomly on the landscape. Home ranges of females were located farthest from riparian areas, whereas home ranges of males were farthest from burned forests. Home ranges of lactating and postlactating females were closer to burned forests than expected, but no group of females had home ranges located closer to or farther from burned forests relative to unburned forests. All groups used habitats randomly within home ranges. Moth abundance and diversity (number of families) were lowest in riparian habitats, indicating that habitat selection by female bats at the landscape, but not home range, scale was influenced by prey availability. Results indicate that low-to-moderate intensity prescribed fires weakly affected the foraging patterns of Rafinesque's big-eared bats in upland forest ecosystems, provided burned forests exist in a matrix of unburned or less-frequently burned forest stands that support a diverse and abundant lepidopteran prey base.","Foraging patterns of Rafinesque's big-eared bat in upland forests managed with prescribed fire",0

We sampled bats with ultrasonic detectors in three different years in dry sclerophyll forests of south-eastern Australia in a long-term, management-scale experiment. Frequent low-intensity burning (every 2 or 4 years plus unburnt) and logging (with 33% retention of the original unlogged tree basal area) were manipulated to assess their effects on bats. We found that both the fire regime and regrowth after logging influenced the local bat community. The routine burning treatment (burnt every 4 years) in unlogged forest was consistently related to higher total bat activity (2–3 times) and species richness when compared to unburnt controls and logging treatments. Foraging activity was more variable, but it was typically lowest in Unlogged Unburnt Controls. These patterns were evident at both the detector site scale and the block scale and were probably due to a reduction in understorey stem density with burning, especially in unlogged forest. Bat activity was significantly lower across the entire study area (including controls) in 1 year, when sampling occurred within 6 months of burning. When pooled across burning treatments, unlogged forest supported higher bat activity (1.5 times) and species richness than logged forest (12- to 17-year-old regrowth), again most likely because of a negative association with high stem density in regrowth after logging. We conclude that low-intensity burning had positive benefits for echolocating bats, most notably in unlogged forest. However, careful planning is required to generate heterogeneous vegetation patterns that are likely to be most suitable for a range of taxa.","Long-term effects of repeated fuel-reduction burning and logging on bats in south-eastern Australia",0

ALAN also affects bat drinking activity, at least when lighting occurs over short intervals. We tested whether continuous illumination of drinking sites over 4-h periods would lead bats to tolerate ALAN and resume drinking in the course of the night. We conducted our experiments in forest (Italy) and desert (Israel) sites to test whether in the latter habitat, where water is scarce, a greater motivation to drink might lead to less adverse bat reactions. We recorded 6853 drinking buzzes and 1647 feeding buzzes from 17 species and one species group. In the forest sites, species that hunt in open spaces or along forest edges showed little (P. pipistrellus and H. savii) or no (P. kuhlii and N. leisleri) drinking activity decrease, while those associated with forest interiors (Barbastella barbastellus, Plecotus auritus and bats in the genus Myotis) exhibited a strong negative response. In the desert sites, all studied species reduced drinking activity, yet in the desert populations of P. kuhlii we recorded stronger adverse reactions only far from human settlements. The harsh reactions that the desert bat species showed towards ALAN rule out any effect of a greater motivation to drink. Illumination had no effect on foraging by most species, except in the forest sites, where Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri increased foraging when the light was on, and in the desert sites, where Hypsugo bodenheimeri decreased foraging in such situations. The progressive human encroachment that is taking place in many world regions on both forests and especially deserts, where few sites for drinking are available, may jeopardize bat populations also through increased exposure to ALAN.","Effects of artificial illumination on drinking bats: a field test in forest and desert habitats",0

The level of damage caused by bats to fruit crops is often debated and the low number of robust damage assessment studies hampers mitigation efforts. During the fruiting season of 2016/2017, we assessed the damage among backyard lychee trees attributable to fruit bats and other causes around Vacoas-Phoenix, Central Mauritius and evaluated the impact of using protective netting as a mitigation strategy. Fruit yield from panicles that were protected from depredation by nylon netting was approximately one third greater than that from unprotected panicles. We suspect that fruit bats were responsible for approximately 42% of the total damage but illustrate the difficulties in attributing damage to a single cause in such assessments. Although we demonstrate the value of protective netting, we recognize that barriers to implementation exist and that a more holistic approach that incorporates crop protection, forest restoration strategies and addresses negative public attitudes towards bats in general is required to ensure the persistence of this endemic species.","Quantifying the damage caused by fruit bats to backyard lychee trees in Mauritius and evaluating the benefits of protective netting",0

We assessed the effect of experimental tourist visits on behavior of the Malagasy endemic Rousettus madagascariensis (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) in the Ankarana National Park, northern Madagascar. We measured bat behavior, including time activity budgets, under two levels of experimental human visit proximity (far and near) and illumination (low and high). These visits caused an increase in bat flights and an increase in alertness in a frequently-visited colony with faint ambient daylight. The greatest response occurred for human approaches to 5-6 m that directly illuminated the bats and the least response occurred for approaches to 12-14 m that did not directly illuminate the bats. In an infrequently-visited colony with no ambient daylight, visits that remained 12-14 m away and did not illuminate the bats directly caused an increase in alert behavior and a decrease in bat grooming behavior. The difference in response between the colonies suggests that R. madagascariensis may demonstrate an attenuated response to some frequent human visits. Alternatively, colonies roosting with some ambient light may be less sensitive to disturbance from visits, and colonies with previous experience primarily with hunting visits may be more responsive to disturbance. Maintaining a minimum visit distance of 12 m and not illuminating the bats directly, as well as not opening other roost sites to tourism, is likely to help to limit disturbance of R. madagascariensis by tourists at Ankarana. © Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.","The effect of tourist visits on the behavior of <i>Rousettus madagascariensis</i> (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) in the caves of Ankarana, northern Madagascar",0

White-nose syndrome (WNS), caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, has caused widespread declines in North American bat populations and threatens several species with extinction. Few tools exist for managers to reduce WNS impacts. We tested the efficacy of a probiotic bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, to reduce impacts of WNS in two simultaneous experiments with caged and free-flying Myotis lucifugus bats at a mine in Wisconsin, USA. In the cage experiment there was no difference in survival between control and P. fluorescens-treated bats. However, body mass, not infection intensity, predicted mortality, suggesting that within-cage disturbance influenced the cage experiment. In the free-flying experiment, where bats were able to avoid conspecific disturbance, infection intensity predicted the date of emergence from the mine. In this experiment treatment with P. fluorescens increased apparent overwinter survival five-fold compared to the control group (from 8.4% to 46.2%) by delaying emergence of bats from the site by approximately 32 days. These results suggest that treatment of bats with P. fluorescens may substantially reduce WNS mortality, and, if used in combination with other interventions, could stop population declines.","Field trial of a probiotic bacteria to protect bats from white-nose syndrome",0

The method encourages fish to approach the netting by generating an active shaking motion using a cap-like canvas at the end of the codend. Three types of model codend were used: a traditional codend, a fluttering flag-like netting panel and a double conical rope array used as an active stimulating device (ASD). The escape responses of juvenile bastard halibut (Paralichthys olivaceus) and juvenile red seabream (Pagrus major) were observed in a circulating water channel. The amplitude ratio of the shaking distance was 0.6-0.8 of the codend diameter and its period was 3-4. s. The escape rate was 22-30% higher in the shaking codends than in steady codends. The relative lateral moving speeds of the escaping fish were 1.4-1.7 times higher when shaking occurred than when no shaking occurred. The sieving effect of the shaking codend operated to actively drive fish to the netting panels and weakened the optomotor response of fish, possibly by generating erratic movement, allowing more fish to escape, and resulting in a reduction of the juvenile by-catch.","Escape response of juvenile fish in a shaking codend determined from tank experiments",0

FADs fisheries are usually exploited using purse seine nets. In Sicilian seas, two different purse seines are used: (a) classic purse seine and (b) a transformed beach seine known as raustina. In this study we compared these two fishing gears in order to determine the best one for assessing fish diversity and to evaluate their impact on the species caught. We sampled the fishes associated with FADs from July to November 2003. Each haul was monitored by a SCUBA diver who observed the species escaping from the different types of net. Results showed that both gears catch the same fish species but significant differences in abundance were detected between gears. In particular, the purse seine caught a higher number of Thunnus thynnus than the beach seine (respectively: 8.2 ± 1.1 vs 0.9 ± 0.2), which in turn proved more efficient in catching C. crysos (31.4 ± 3.7 vs 8.9 ± 1.5 caught by purse seine). SCUBA observations revealed that T. thynnus escapes capture more easily from the beach seine than from the purse seine, due to their behaviour of swimming at a depth beneath that reached by the beach seine. On the other hand, the smallest specimens of C. crysos pass more easily through purse seine mesh, which is larger than beach seine mesh. Both gears are equally useful for assessing biodiversity associated with FADs, although they give different results for fish abundance. As the catches of FADs fishery target species (i.e. Coryphaena hippurus) were similar for the two gears, the modified beach seine could be proposed as a management tool to reduce the catches of young T. thynnus in accordance with European legislation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Assessing the fish assemblage associated with FADs (Fish Aggregating Devices) in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea using two different professional fishing gears",0

Sprung from an unbalance in available fish- and Nephrops quotas and an ambition to protect coastal areas, the current fishery has been directed towards three separate fisheries (mixed trawling, directed trawling using a sorting grid and creeling). Studying direct and indirect effects from alternative Swedish quota allocations among gear types is therefore interesting. Accordingly, a screening study was conducted, taking into consideration area-gear interactions in catch rates, to compare the three different fisheries regarding quantified pressures on the target species, the by-catch species, and on the seafloor, as well as to qualitatively discuss social and economic dimensions. In the next step, alternative quota allocations were studied. In Swedish fisheries, we show that creeling offers a substantial reduction of fishing mortality of both undersized Nephrops and fish and a reduced seafloor pressure per landed kilo of Nephrops. Given that the fishing areas in many cases may be interchangeable between gears, allocating a larger quota share to creels in the Swedish fishery would therefore contribute to the integration of fisheries- and environmental management as called for in the new policies.","New policies may call for new approaches: the case of the Swedish Norway lobster (<i>Nephrops norvegicus</i>) fisheries in the Kattegat and Skagerrak",0

We used a passive ultrasonic event recorder (A-tag) to obtain acoustic encounter rates of echolocating finless porpoises and compared results for the presence and absence of pinger transmissions in Omura Bay, Japan, over two 8-mo periods (2011 and 2012). Encounter rates were significantly lower during periods when pingers were in operation, but the effect of pingers decreased with time. By the eighth month of the study in each study year, the number of encounters during the ensonified period was greater than that during periods without pingers, suggesting habituation. When pingers were reactivated at the study site after 4 mo of silence, the encounters with the active pingers returned to the lower level observed at the beginning of the experiment. These results reveal that the pingers effectively induce avoidance in porpoises, but that this effectiveness only lasts for a few months, which is likely due to habituation which could be mitigated by alternating periods of several months of silence between periods of active pinger use.","Long-term effectiveness of pingers on a small population of finless porpoises in Japan",0

Regulation of boat approaches varies by site and no systematic investigations have been performed to inform management guidelines. To investigate possible effects of disturbance, experimental boat approaches were made to a colony at Kanowna Island in northern Bass Strait and seal responses were monitored using instantaneous scan sampling. Colony attendance (individuals remaining ashore) was found to be influenced by approach distance and time of day, but was not affected by environmental variables or season, whereas onshore resting behavior was influenced by approach distance, time of day, ambient temperature and wind direction. Onshore resting behavior decreased following experimental boat approaches to 75 m, but changes in abundance of individuals ashore were not observed at this distance. In contrast, approaches to 25 m elicited a strong response, with a steep decline in the number of individuals ashore. This response was strongest when approaches occurred in the morning, with a decline of approximately 47% of individuals, compared to a decline of 21% during afternoon approaches. With regard to onshore resting behavior, afternoon approaches to 75 m led to minimal response. The remaining three combinations of approach distance and time of day had a similar pattern of reductions in the proportion of individuals engaging in onshore resting behavior. The strongest response was again seen during approaches to 25 m conducted in the morning. These behavior changes suggest that unrestricted boat-based ecotourism at Australian fur seal colonies has the potential to increase energy expenditure and reduce the number of seals ashore. Increasing minimum approach distances to =75 m and/or restricting visits to afternoons may minimize these impacts at Kanowna Island during the post-molt and non-breeding seasons. As several studies have demonstrated considerable intra-species variation in seal responses to boat approaches, research at other colonies is needed before these findings can be generalized to the remainder of the Australian fur seal population.","Behavioral responses of Australian fur seals to boat approaches at a breeding colony",0

Here, we analyze our cumulative experience with translocation of Hawaiian monk seals. We found a strong correlation between the time seals remained in the vicinity of the release site and their age. Recently weaned pups (with little or no at-sea foraging experience) exhibited high fidelity to release sites commensurate with that shown by untranslocated pups to their birth location. In contrast, juvenile and adult seals tended to stray from their release locations farther and sooner. Nevertheless, when 21 adult male seals were moved more than 1000. km from Laysan Island in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), to the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), they subsequently dispersed among the MHI; however, only one was observed to return to the NWHI. Translocated seals appeared to survive at rates comparable to seals native to the release site. Outcomes suggest that in most cases the intended objectives of translocations were achieved.

We conducted an aerial survey designed as far as possible to provide an index of abundance comparable with that derived from the whale 'spotter' planes employed by the Albany whaling company from 1968 to 1978, using the number of sperm bulls seen on each morning flight as a comparative index between bulls seen historically and in 2009. The mean number of sperm bulls seen on transect in 2009 was 2.43 (95% percentile interval [0.96, 6.08]); this increased to 3.38 (95% percentile interval [1.30, 7.60]) when sightings offtransect were included. Both 2009 point estimates were lower than the mean (±SE) number seen in any of the years between 1968 and 1978, which ranged from 6.30 (±1.18) in 1976 to 12.45 (±1.83) in 1968. The lack of recovery in the population of bull sperm whales offAlbany, despite full protection, is of concern and adds weight to the growing body of evidence that suggests that sperm whales may not be recovering effectively from past exploitation.","No evidence for recovery in the population of sperm whale bulls off Western Australia, 30 years post-whaling",0

Although these programs have enhanced bathing safety, reducing the environmental impacts of decades of fishing for large sharks and the associated by-catch remains a challenge. Over the past three decades, there have been several interventions to reduce such impact in the KZN program. The first was the release of all live sharks, including those species known to be responsible for fatal shark attacks. Measures to reduce catches of sharks associated with the winter influx of shoals of sardines, Sardinops sagax, have been increasingly successful. In addition, extensive removal of nets has resulted in a major reduction in effort. Collectively, these initiatives reduced mortalities of sharks by 64%. Baited lines, termed drumlines, were introduced at 18 beaches, where they replaced some of the nets. The former had a far lower by-catch of rays, turtles and cetaceans and significantly lower catches of certain shark species. Replacement of some nets with drumlines is planned for the remaining beaches. Only two attacks, both non-fatal, have occurred at protected beaches in KZN over the past three decades, indicating that the program has maintained its public safety mandate while it has succeeded in reducing its impact on the environment. © CSIRO 2011.","Reducing the environmental impact of shark-control programs: a case study from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa",0

A successful captive breeding program for a new species cannot be implemented until reliable capture and husbandry techniques have been developed. Techniques for assisted reproduction and reintroduction may also be needed. We review attempts to capture, maintain, and breed poorly known small cetaceans and discuss assisted reproductive technologies (ART) that have been used to enhance captive breeding efforts for other small cetaceans. We conclude that the techniques required for successful captive breeding of most Endangered or Critically Endangered small cetacean species have not been sufficiently developed. Development of these techniques should begin before a species or population is Critically Endangered. In particular, ARTs tend to be species specific, necessitating considerable time, money, and research to develop for each species of concern. Critically Endangered populations cannot afford to lose the individuals needed for technique development. The fairly large captive population sizes necessary (to avoid loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding, and genetic adaptation to captivity), limited space available in aquariums, and high costs of captive breeding and reintroduction programs make it unlikely that captive breeding will play a major role in the conservation of most small cetaceans. The substantive conservation measures needed to prevent extinction of Critically Endangered small cetaceans is reduction or elimination of their primary threats, which are usually by-catch and habitat loss.","Prospects for captive breeding of poorly known small cetacean species",1

Previous studies have shown that calves born to provisioned females experienced reduced care and higher mortality relative to calves of non-provisioned mothers.

In Peru, where cetacean species are still in jeopardy, whale-watching may play an important part in promoting the protection of these species. This study aimed to determine the degree of whale-watching tourists' knowledge regarding cetacean ecology and conservation status and to evaluate if whale-watching tours could serve as platforms for educating the public and raising conservation awareness. The results of 196 closed-ended questionnaires and 20 open-ended interviews conducted before and after whale-watching tours, during the humpback whale season (winter–spring 2014) in northern Peru, revealed an overall lack of knowledge concerning the presence of species of cetaceans in Peruvian waters and threats to marine biodiversity. However, after the whale-watching excursion, participants said they would be more willing to change their behaviour with respect to cetacean conservation and marine environment protection.

While rehabilitation is common practice, it is unclear if rehabilitated seal pups behave like wild weaned pups. Using satellite transmitters, we compared movement patterns of 10 rehabilitated pups with 10 wild weaned pups. When released, rehabilitated seals were longer and heavier than wild pups, while wild pups had a larger mean axillary girth. No clinically different blood parameters were detected. On average, rehabilitated harbor seal pups traveled nearly twice as far cumulatively, almost three times as far daily, and dispersed over three times as far from the release site compared to wild weaned seals. Additionally, wild harbor seals transmitted nearly twice as long as did rehabilitated seals.

During 1984-1995, the pro-gram collected 98 young female monk seals whose mortality appeared certain (underweight and in some cases ill) from French Frigate Shoals (FFS) and attempted to nourish and rehabilitate these animals to enable their release as healthy individ-uals. Six additional young females of normal size were relocated from FFS (5) and Oahu (1) to Kure Atoll where their survival rate was expected to be higher than at their birth islands. The goal of the program was salvaging the reproductive potential of young female monk seals to aid in the recov-ery of this endangered species.

During the feasibility trial, an underwater acoustic playback and a moored boat performed without issue. A float array proved hazardous to non-target wildlife and electronic diver devices functioned poorly; both were omitted from further experimentation. The number of shark sightings and predation incidents at two pupping islets was compared across two experimental treatments: (1) acoustic playback and a moored boat, and (2) continuous human presence, versus a control. Sharks were sighted with a remote camera system; predation incidents were evident from bite wounds or the disappearance of pups. Observed shark activity was rare (12 sightings on video and six predation incidents) but similar to recent years. The number of shark sightings and predation incidents did not differ significantly between the two treatments and the control. The relative scarcity of shark activity in the shallows around the pupping islets made detecting a treatment effect challenging. Sharks' wariness to humans is probably variable, unpredictable, possibly individualistic and unreliable at FFS.

However, ADDs have also been highlighted as a conservation concern since they can inflict large-scale habitat exclusion in toothed whales (odontocetes). We tested a new method that selectively inflicted startle responses in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) at close ranges to the loudspeaker but not in a non-target species, the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), by using a frequency range where porpoise hearing was less sensitive than that of phocid seals. The sound exposure consisted of isolated 200ms long, 2-3 octave-band noise pulses with a peak frequency of 1kHz, which were presented at a source level of ~180dB re 1µPa. Field tests were carried out within a 2-month period on a fish farm on the west coast of Scotland where marine mammal behaviour was observed within three distance categories. Seal numbers dropped sharply during sound exposure compared with control observation periods within 250m of the sound source but were unaffected at distances further away from the farm. A Poisson regression model revealed that the number of seal tracks within 250m of the device decreased by ~91% during sound exposure and was primarily influenced by sound exposure with no evidence for a change in the effect of treatment such as habituation, throughout the experiment. In contrast to seals, there was no shift in the number of porpoise groups in each distance category as a result of sound exposure and porpoises were regularly seen close to the device. We also sighted six common minke whales during sound exposure while only one was seen during control periods.

Reports by fishers that depredating odontocetes avoid gear tangles has underpinned the development of simulated structures to physically deter depredating odontocetes. This study assessed the efficacy of two such devices developed to mitigate odontocete depredation and associated bycatch. Of particular interest was their impact on (i) soak depth and (ii) sink rate using truncated trials, before determining their impact under full operational conditions on rates of (iii) catch of the five most economically important fish, and (iv) odontocete depredation and bycatch, on changes in (v) fish survival and size, and (vi) setting and hauling speed. The results indicated that the inclusion of devices on longlines had negligible impact on soak depth, thus were unlikely to impact on the suite of fish specifically targeted and caught. The sink rate was slowed, perhaps by drag, trapped air, or propeller wash, although the addition of weight might remedy this if the devices were to be used in areas where seabird bycatch could occur. Most importantly, trials conducted in Australian and in Fijian waters indicated that pooled fish catch rates (i.e. albacore, yellowfin, bigeye, mahi mahi, and wahoo) increased in the presence of the devices, possibly because more fish were attracted by them or because more depredators were deterred. Catch rates on control gear next to gear with devices attached were higher than more distant control gear, suggesting the influences of the devices may have extended to adjacent branchlines. The size of caught fish was mostly unaffected, although the survival of yellowfin and bigeye increased significantly in the presence of the devices. Hauling was slowed by the use of the devices and the need for an extra crewmember during setting and hauling, which could be cost prohibitive in some fisheries, especially if economic benefits from their use are not obvious. Despite the small sample size, odontocete bycatch only occurred on unprotected fishing gear and all individuals were released alive, although their fate was uncertain; there was evidence of injuries sustained from the event. The outcomes are positive and should motivate stakeholders to view such devices as a potentially effective tool for mitigating odontocete bycatch and depredation in this and similar longline fisheries. Future efforts should focus on improving operational integration and reducing implementation costs to encourage voluntary uptake and thus avoid non-compliance and the need for costly monitoring. The use of this technology could bring about marked improvements to the conservation situation for affected odontocete populations and to the economic situation for affected longline fisheries.","Two devices for mitigating odontocete bycatch and depredation at the hook in tropical pelagic longline fisheries",0

Acoustic deterrents on fishing nets are widely used to reduce incidental captures of dolphins and porpoises, but there is little evidence as to whether they effectively deter large whales. We tested whether a low-frequency whale alarm (3 kHz Whale Pinger®, 135 ± 5 db, 5 s emission interval and 400 ms emission duration) deterred Southern Hemisphere humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae from approaching a potential source of entanglement. Northerly migrating humpback whale pods were tracked by an observer blind to alarm status (on/off) as they passed an alarm moored in the centre of the peak migration path. Of 137 pods tracked, 82 (60%) passed within the assumed detectable range (500 m) of the alarm, 51/78 (65%) when it was on and 31/59 (52%) when it was off(p = 0.18). There was no discernible response to the alarm. Whale pods did not differ in directionality, course heading or dive duration when within detectable range of the alarm, whether it was on or off, and a number of pods passed directly over the alarm while it was operational. This suggests that single alarms as currently configured and attached to a trap or pot line are unlikely to effectively deter humpback whales from approaching potential hazards, at least during their northerly migration phase.","A whale alarm fails to deter migrating humpback whales: an empirical test",0

Acoustic click detectors were deployed on test and control nets to assess the response of cetaceans to the pingers. No significant practical problems, apart from premature failure of pingers, were encountered. During the study, only one harbour porpoise was bycaught, in an unpingered net. In 650 days of acoustic data from pingered and non-pingered nets, matched by location, date and boat, there was a highly significant reduction in the number of porpoise clicks recorded at nets with pingers to 48% of the number predicted from the number recorded at control nets (range 35-51%). To assess habituation, single, modified pingers that were active for alternate seven hour periods were moored below a click detector at two sites, one of which has strong tides and high levels of associated ambient noise. This study showed a stronger pinger effect at the quiet site and a much reduced effect at the noisy site. There was evidence of a period of exclusion of porpoises following pinger use that could exceed seven hours, and no evidence of habituation. Results suggest that pingers are practical on small vessels, that they reduce harbour porpoise activity around nets and are therefore likely to reduce bycatch. Easier means of detecting pinger failure are needed.

In the Northwest Hawaiian Islands, where most of these interventions took place, we found a significant relationship between the number of interventions conducted annually and duration of field effort. The survival and reproduction of the intervention seals were tracked through multiple generations, using (1) known survival and reproduction of intervention seals, and (2) expected survival and reproduction as determined using demographic rates estimated for the population at large. This analysis indicated that 17-24% of the 2012 population comprised either intervention seals or descendants of intervention seals. If seals included in a multiyear (1984-1992) re habilitation and captive care effort are also included, this proportion increases to 32%.

The annual rate of increase was 9.4% yr1 (SE = 0.01) between 1984 and 2007. This rate of increase is higher than the increase estimated at the breeding grounds in the West Indies, but is of the same magnitude as the observed rate of increase at other feeding grounds in the North Atlantic.

This study assessed vessel and kayak visitation and resulting impacts on harbor seals in the Kenai Fjords National Park, southcentral Alaska. We obtained observations from 2002 to 2011, using remotely controlled video cameras located near Aialik and Pedersen Glaciers in the Kenai Fjords National Park. Overall, disturbance was associated with 5.1% of vessel sightings, 28% of vessel interactions (vessel observed within approx. 300 m of seals), 11.5% of kayak sightings, and 61% of kayak interactions. Results demonstrated that voluntary changes in operations significantly reduced vessel and kayak disturbance of seals by 60-80%. Even with prior establishment of operating guidelines, tour vessel captains were able to further reduce their effect on wildlife with more careful operations. Rapid growth of guided kayak excursions that occurred during this study caused greater disturbance to seals than motorized vessels but guide trainings helped reduce disturbances. Diminished impacts of motor vessels and kayakers persisted across years although effects of kayaks were less consistent than motor vessels, which reflected greater variability in inter-annual spatial use patterns by kayakers. Long-term monitoring, including assessments of wildlife responses to vessel and kayak operations, combined with 2-way communication with vessel operators and guides, enhanced the effectiveness of mitigation and facilitated adaptive adjustments to mitigation protocols over time. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","Efficacy of voluntary mitigation in reducing harbor seal disturbance",0

Studies in the Baltic Sea have shown that this could be achieved by implementing alternative fishing methods, e.g. by using fish pots instead of lines or gillnets. However, as in net and line fisheries, a pot fishery could also result in bycatch of seals. In order to prevent these bycatches, pot entrances were equipped with seal exclusion devices (SEDs) of various sizes and shapes. A field study was conducted to investigate what effect different types of SEDs had on the bycatch of seals as well as on the pot's catchability. When pots where equipped with SEDs the bycatch of seals was reduced to zero without negatively affecting the pot's catchability. The shape and size of the entrance did have a significant effect on the pot's catchability and the size of the fish. Using symmetrical oval shaped entrances along with larger rectangular entrances divided into two smaller openings increased the pot's catchability.","Seal exclusion devices in cod pots prevent seal bycatch and affect their catchability of cod",0

To evaluate the effectiveness of this rule, we plotted the locations of all right whale and humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae carcasses attributed to ship-strikes since December 1990 in US waters to determine their proximity to SMAs. In the 18 yr pre-rule period, 13 of 15 (87%) right whales and 12 of 26 (46%) humpback whales killed by ships were found inside later SMA boundaries or within 45 nmi (83 km) of their perimeters during later active dates. In the first 5 yr after the rule became effective, no ship-struck right whales were found inside or within 45 nmi of any active SMA. This was nearly twice as long as the longest pre-rule period without discovery of a ship-struck carcass in those areas during effective time periods. Based on the 18 yr pre-rule period, bootstrap resampling analyses revealed that the probability of finding no ship-struck whales in or near SMAs during the first 5 yr post-rule period would be a statistically significant reduction in such deaths (p = 0.031).

Fourteen vessels fished a total of 168 days in the North Sea in 1997. In the wreck fishery the total effort was 1052 nets with active pingers, 1056 nets with dummy pingers and 74 nets without pingers. Eight porpoises were caught, all in nets with dummy pingers. In the flat bottom/stony ground fishery the total effort was 5596 nets with active pingers, 5210 nets with dummy pingers and 2973 nets without pingers. Sixteen porpoises were caught, including 1 animal in a net with active pingers, 6 in nets with dummy pingers and 9 in nets without pingers. The difference in bycatch between nets with active pingers and nets with inactive or no pingers was highly significant (p<. 0.007) for both the wreck fishery and the flat bottom/stony ground fishery. We conclude that the direct effects of the pinger signals on the porpoises caused the reduction in bycatch, which means that the results can be generalized to other situations where harbour porpoises are taken in gillnets. Generalized linear modelling demonstrated that cod cpue was not affected negatively by pingers. It was furthermore estimated that the stony ground fishery had significantly lower (p<. 0.001) cpue values (a factor 0.47) compared to the wreck fishery.

The nature of interactions and effectiveness of a seal exclusion device (SED) in mitigating lethal interactions was assessed using underwater video. Recent fishing activity and the phase of the trawl operation significantly influenced interaction rates; interactions increased with the amount of recent trawl activity and were highest while the trawl was being set. Most seals accessed the trawl via the net entrance and exited via an escape opening located at the base of the SED. The size of the escape opening was the only operational factor that influenced mortality rates — simply enlarging the escape hole reduced lethal interactions by 79%. However, since all deceased seals dropped out of the net before they were brought on board, they would have gone unobserved without video monitoring. Limiting the concentration of fishing activity in space and time and refinement of the SED design, in particular to address dropouts, is recommended if mortality rates are to be reduced.","Underwater observations of seal-fishery interactions and the effectiveness of an exclusion device in reducing bycatch in a midwater trawl fishery",0

Bycatch of small cetaceans by the Peruvian small-scale driftnet fleet results in the deaths of thousands of animals annually. We sought to assess the effectiveness of acoustic alarms (pingers) for reducing the incidental capture of dolphins and porpoises by this fleet. Forty-three experimental trips (156 fishing sets) and 47 control trips (195 fishing sets) out of Salaverry Port, northern Peru, were observed from April 2009 to August 2011. Twenty-two percent of control sets captured small cetaceans (67 individuals) and 16% of experimental sets had captures of small cetaceans (33 individuals). The bycatch rate of experimental sets was 0.50 individuals km-2h-1, whereas for control sets the rate was 0.80 individuals km-2h-1. This 37% reduction in bycatch rate suggests that pingers may be effective in reducing the bycatch of small cetaceans in this fishery. Catch rates of the fishery's target shark and ray species were unchanged. Given the vast size of this fishery and its current levels of bycatch of small cetaceans (>Â 10,000 individuals annually), even the modest declines in bycatch we observed could result in reductions in mortality of hundreds or thousands of small cetaceans per annum. Challenges, including increased costs, to large-scale utilization of pingers have yet to be overcome.

In Brazil habitat destruction and overhunting severely reduced and fragmented the wild population, restricting extant subpopulations to the north and north-east coast. In response to these threats an ambitious government-led programme was initiated in 1994, with the aim of rehabilitating orphaned manatee calves and releasing them into the southernmost subpopulation. The programme is unique within Brazil, and has invested unprecedented resources in post-release monitoring. So far 30 manatees have been released at three sites, with a high rate of success (> 75%). Time in captivity appears to be a key variable determining post-release success: too long or too short a time in captivity decreasing the probability of survival. We describe the main features of this long-term programme and identify six key lessons learnt: (1) close monitoring, health assessments and rescues can significantly increase the success of releases, (2) combining different monitoring techniques results in high-quality data and reduces tracking costs, (3) long-term studies are needed to effectively evaluate the results, (4) releasing manatees at c. 5 years of age can increase chances of success, (5) soft-release is important to aid acclimatization, and (6) the programme has been effective in raising awareness among the general public, supporting education and fund-raising.","Eighteen years of Antillean manatee <i>Trichechus manatus manatus</i> releases in Brazil: lessons learnt",0

Although numerous Hawaiian monk seals Neomonachus schauinslandi have been translocated for a variety of purposes, few monk seal translocations have addressed the problem of prey limitation. To assess the efficacy of using translocations to mitigate reduced prey availability, 12 weanling monk seals were translocated with pre-release health screening and post-release monitoring. Specifically, the health, foraging behavior, habitat use, and survival of translocated seals were compared with those of 17 monk seals resident to the release site. There was little evidence of infectious diseases in translocated and resident seals, although Chlamydophila abortus antibodies and enteric bacteria were detected in many individuals. Translocated and resident weanling seals also demonstrated similar diving, movements, and habitat use, whereas resident adult seals had greater variability in foraging patterns. First-year survival for translocated weanlings (50%, n = 12) and non-translocated weanlings at the donor (31%, n = 36) and recipient sites (69%, n = 16) was related to weaning body size, with larger individuals having greater survivorship. These results supported 3 main conclusions that have important consequences for future translocation and population recovery efforts: (1) there was minimal risk of exposing seals to novel infectious diseases as a result of translocation; (2) individuals translocated with limited foraging experience rapidly adapted to their post-release environment; and (3) translocation for the purpose of mitigating prey limitation is a viable and important conservation tool for Hawaiian monk seals.","An integrated approach for assessing translocation as an effective conservation tool for Hawaiian monk seals",0

Effects vary considerably between populations and sites, thus requiring separate assessment of human impacts on activity and energy budgets. Responses of the endangered Australian sea lion, Neophoca cinerea, to human visitation were recorded from November 2013 through April 2014. Exposure levels and response types to anthropogenic activities were assessed at two easily accessible locations with different management schemes, Seal (landing prohibited) and Carnac (landing permitted) islands, Western Australia. Exposure levels were measured as both stimulus type (i.e. ‘People’, ‘Paddlers’, ‘Small’, ‘Medium’, and ‘Large vessels’, ‘Tour vessels’, and ‘Jet skies’), and people (‘Direct’, ‘Attract’, ‘Interact’, ‘View’, ‘Incidental’, ‘Water’, ‘Low-level’), and vessel activities (‘Interact’, ‘Approach/Follow’, ‘Anchor noise’, ‘Engine noise’, ‘Close to beach’, ‘Moderate/Fast travel’, ‘Slow travel’, ‘Transit’, ‘Drift/At anchor’, ‘Aircraft noise’). Exposure levels varied significantly between the islands in numbers, stimuli type, duration and minimum approach distances. The instantaneous behaviours of ‘Lift head’, ‘Interact’ and ‘Sit’ were the most frequent responses. ‘Aggressive’ and ‘Retreat’ responses, the highest disturbance levels measured, occurred on Carnac approximately once per day, but rarely on Seal Island. ‘Aggressive’ behaviour towards ‘People’ was observed only on Carnac Island and elicited only by ‘People’. ‘People’, ‘Tour vessels’, and scenic ‘Aircrafts’ on both islands as well as ‘Jet skis’ on Carnac Island had the highest probability of triggering responses. Owing to their relatively high visitation at Seal Island, ‘Paddle powered vessels’, followed by ‘Tour vessels’ elicited the highest number of responses, compared with ‘People’, ‘Small’, and ‘Medium vessels’ at Carnac Island. The majority of responses occurred when any stimulus type was at short-range (=10 m), and ‘People’ ‘Viewing’ N. cinerea elicited most. Vessels triggered more responses at larger ranges than ‘People’. To limit close-range access to N. cinerea, one possibility is to close the beach at Carnac Island to human visitation and increase the minimum approach distance by vessels and ‘People’ by installing marker buoys at least 15 m from the shore. © 2016 The Authors.

We compared how whales responded in terms of changes of surface behaviour and changes in direction of travel in response to 2 acoustic tones and when there was no alarm. These 2 acoustic tones were a 5 kHz tone (5 s emission interval and 400 ms emission duration, similar to but higher frequency than the signal from a Future Oceans F3™ 3 kHz Whale Pinger®) and a 2-2.1 kHz swept tone (8 s emission interval and 1.5 s emission duration).

Whales showed no detectable response to either alarm. Whale direction and surfacing behaviour did not differ whether the alarm was 'on' or 'off'. Although the response may have been different if the alarms were attached to fishing gear, the lack of measurable response suggests that the types of tones used are not likely to be effective in alarms intended to reduce entanglement of northward migrating Australian humpback whales.","Migrating humpback whales show no detectable response to whale alarms off Sydney, Australia",0

Leptospiruria was assessed by real-time PCR of urine and urine culture, with persistence assessed using longitudinally collected samples. Serum chemistry was used to assess recovery of normal renal function. Microscopic agglutination testing (MAT) was performed to assess serum anti-Lepto-spira antibody titers, and the MAT reactivity pat-terns were consistent with L. interrogans serovar Pomona infection frequently observed in this population. Animals were initially treated for 6 to 16 d (median = 10.5; mean = 10.8) with antibiot-ics from the penicillin family, with some receiving additional antibiotics to treat other medical condi-tions. All urine cultures were negative; therefore, the presence of leptospiruria was assessed using PCR. Leptospiruria continued beyond the initial course of penicillin family antibiotics in 13 of the 14 sea lions, beyond the last antibiotic dose in 11 of the 14 sea lions, beyond recovery of renal func-tion in 13 of the 14 sea lions, and persisted for at least 8 to 86 d (median = 45; mean = 46.8). Five animals were released with no negative urine PCR results detected; thus, their total shedding duration may have been longer. Cessation of leptospiruria was more likely in animals that received antibiot-ics for a greater duration, especially if coverage was uninterrupted. Real-time PCR results indicate that an antibiotic protocol commonly used to treat leptospirosis in rehabilitating California sea lions does not eliminate leptospiruria. It is possible that antibiotic protocols given for a longer duration and/or including other antibiotics may be effec-tive in eliminating leptospiruria. These results may have important human and animal health implications, especially in rehabilitation facilities, as Leptospira transmission may occur through contact with animals with persistent leptospiruria.","Antibiotic efficacy in eliminating leptospiruria in California sea lions (<i>Zalophus californianus</i>) stranding with leptospirosis",0

In controlled experiments, we tested its efficacy by observing changes in the dolphin's behaviour brought on by the presence or absence of the device on branchlines. First, dolphin-SPF interactions were observed at the small scale using video footage recorded with an underwater camcorder. Second, the efficacy of the device was quantified from interactions between dolphins and 80 branchlines deployed on a longline 500 m long baited with SPF. One half of the SPF on successive branchlines was protected by DEPRED and the other half was not. A total of 707 branchlines were set when dolphins interacted with SPF, and among them, 355 were equipped with DEPRED. Encouraging results were obtained: over the short term, the number of damaged unprotected SPF was on average more than twice the number of protected ones.

We tested the efficacy of fear conditioning using acoustic stimuli for reducing California sea lion Zalophus californianus interactions from two fishing contexts in California, USA; bait barges and recreational fishing vessels. We performed conditioning trials on 24 individual sea lions interacting with bait barges. We tested for acquisition of conditioned fear by pairing a neutral tone with a startle stimulus. Avoidance was strongest in response to the startle stimulus alone, but low when paired with a neutral tone. From actively fishing vessels, we tested for fear conditioning by exposing sea lions to a neutral tone followed by a startle pulse, a startle pulse alone or a no sound control. We conducted playbacks from 146 (including 48 no sound control) stops over two summer fishing seasons (2013, 2014). The startle stimulus decreased surfacing frequency, reduced bait foraging and increased surfacing distance from the vessel while the conditioned stimulus only caused a mild reduction in surfacing frequency with no other behavioral change. Exposing animals to a pair of a conditioned stimulus with a startle pulse did not achieve the intended management outcome. Rather, it generated evidence (in two study contexts) of immediate learning that led to the reduction of the unconditioned response. Taken together, our results suggest that for fear conditioning to be applied as a non-lethal deterrent, careful consideration has to be given to individual behavior, the unconditioned/conditioned responses and the overall management goals.","Can fear conditioning repel California sea lions from fishing activities?",0

Australian snubfin Orcaella heinsohni and humpback dolphins Sousa chinensis occur in small fragmented populations along most of the remote coast of subtropical and tropical Australia, where they are caught in gillnet fisheries operated from small vessels. We experimentally investigated whether a commercially available acoustic alarm modified the behaviour of each of these species in the absence of a net. The movements and behaviour of both species changed subtly when the pingers were active, but the likelihood of the animals leaving an area was not significantly different from the controls. Our results suggest that this technological approach may not be effective in reducing the bycatch of these species. We suggest that further experimentation is unlikely to be cost effective and that government agencies should work with fishers and scientists to explore alternative mitigation measures.","Acoustic alarms elicit only subtle responses in the behaviour of tropical coastal dolphins in Queensland, Australia",0

Several species/species groups responded proactively to the soft start procedure (where the level of firing is increased gradually) indicating that this can be an effective mitigation measure in reducing the risk of physiological damage.

We studied interactions between bottlenose dolphins and a gillnet fishery for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) in North Carolina, USA and investigated the effect of SaveWave® acoustic deterrent devices on target fish catch and the frequency and nature of interactions with bottlenose dolphins. We made observations from commercial vessels and conducted focal visual and acoustic follows of dolphins from a research vessel. We examined the effects of SaveWave® devices on fish catches and dolphin behavior by comparing sets with functioning (active) devices and non-functioning (control) devices. In 2003, we collected baseline data on catch and dolphin behavior from 136 gillnet sets; during 2004 and 2005 we monitored 151 gillnet sets (83 with active devices, 68 with control devices). Fish catches were significantly lower when dolphins were observed interacting with gillnets. SaveWave® status (active versus control) did not affect fish catch, but dolphins were less likely to interact with and more likely to echolocate around gillnets equipped with active SaveWaves® than gillnets with control SaveWaves®.

Because these are primarily pelagic, continental shelf-edge animals, much of what is known about this species has derived from mass stranding events. Post-release monitoring via satellite-linked telemetry was conducted with two adult males determined on-site to be healthy, and released directly from a mass stranding of 23 pilot whales in May 2011, near Cudjoe Key, Florida. Tracking provided an opportunity to evaluate the decision for immediate release vs rehabilitation, and to learn more about the lives of members of this difficult-to-study species in the wild. The two pilot whales remained together for at least 16 d before transmissions from one pilot whale (Y-404) ceased. Dive patterns and travel rates suggested that Y-404's condition deteriorated prior to signal loss. Pilot Whale Y-400 was tracked for another 51 d, moving from the Blake Plateau to the Greater Antilles, remaining in the Windward Passage east of Cuba for the last 17 d of tracking. Once he reached the Antilles, Y-400 remained in high-relief habitat appropriate for the species and made dives within or exceeding the reported range for depth and duration for this species, following expected diel patterns, presumably reflecting continued good health. Telemetry data indicate that he made at least one dive to 1,000 to 1,500 m, and several dives lasted more than 40 min. Although the fates of the two released pilot whales may have been different, the concept of evaluating health and releasing individuals determined to be healthy at the time of stranding appears to have merit as an alternative to bringing all members of mass-stranded pilot whale groups into rehabilitation.","Movements and dive patterns of short-finned pilot whales (<i>Globicephala macrorhynchus</i>) released from a mass stranding in the Florida Keys",0

This removal, called depredation, is economically costly to fishermen, presents risk of injury or mortality to whales, and could lead to unknown removals during the federal sablefish longline survey that contributes to estimation of the annual fishing quota. In 2013 the Southeast Alaska Sperm Whale Avoidance Project (SEASWAP) evaluated the efficacy of an acoustic decoy in reducing encounters between sperm whales and longline fishing gear. The aim of the acoustic decoy was to use fishing vessel sounds to attract whales to an area away from the true fishing haul in order to reduce interactions between commercial fishing vessels and whales. A custom playback device that could be remotely activated via a radio modem was incorporated into an anchored buoy system that could be deployed by the vessel during a two-month trip between June and July 2013. Once activated, the decoy broadcasted vessel-hauling noises known to attract whales, while the vessel performed several true hauls at various ranges from the device. Passive acoustic recorders at both the decoy and true set locations were also deployed to evaluate whale presence. Twenty-six hauls were conducted while a decoy was deployed, yielding fourteen sets with whales present while the decoy was functional. A significant relationship was found between the number of whales present at the true fishing haul and the distance of the haul from the decoy (1–14 km range), with the decoy being most effective at ranges greater than 9 km (t = -2.06, df = 12, p = 0.04). The results suggest that acoustic decoys may be a cost-effective means for reducing longlining depredation from sperm and possibly killer whales under certain circumstances.","Field trials of an acoustic decoy to attract sperm whales away from commercial longline fishing vessels in western Gulf of Alaska",0

At 6 wind farms, active noise mitigation systems (NMS) were applied during most piling events, and 1 was constructed without. Based on generalized additive modelling analyses, we describe a clear gradient in the decline of porpoise detections after piling, depending on noise level and distance to piling. Declines were found at sound levels exceeding 143 dB re 1 µPa2s (the sound exposure level exceeded during 5% of piling time, SEL05) and up to 17 km from piling. When only considering piling events with NMS, the maximum effect distance was 14 km. Compared to 24-48 h before piling, porpoise detections declined more strongly during unmitigated piling events at all distances: at 10-15 km declines were around 50% during piling without NMS, but only 17% when NMS were applied. Within the vicinity (up to about 2 km) of the construction site, porpoise detections declined several hours before the start of piling and were reduced for about 1-2 d after piling, while at the maximum effect distance, avoidance was only found during the hours of piling. The application of first generation NMS thus reduced the effect range of pile driving and led to a lower decline of porpoise detections over all distances. However, NMS were still under development and did not always work with equal efficiency. As NMS have further developed since, future investigations are expected to show additional reduction of disturbance effects.","Disturbance of harbour porpoises during construction of the first seven offshore wind farms in Germany",0

Therefore, it is common practice to attempt to deter the mammals out of potential danger zones beforehand. Seal scarers are commonly used as a deterrent for harbour porpoises in spite of a lack of clear evidence in support of their effectiveness. We investigated the responses of harbour porpoises to a Lofitech seal scarer by conducting visual observations in conjunction with sound measurements. Porpoise sighting rates within 1 km of the seal scarer significantly decreased to only 1% during seal scarer activity. During 22 trials, when the seal scarer was deployed between 300 m and 3.3 km distance, all observed porpoises always avoided the seal scarer within 1.9 km (translating to sound levels of =122 dB re 1 µParms), avoided the seal scarer half the time within 2.1 to 2.4 km (119 to 121 dB re 1 µParms) and never avoided the seal scarer at distances beyond 2.6 km (=118 dB re 1 µParms). The closest observed approach distance of a porpoise to the activated seal scarer was 798 m (132 dB re 1 µParms). Thus, the deployment of a Lofitech seal scarer during offshore pile driving activities can greatly reduce the risk of acoustic traumata to harbour porpoises.

However, this information is crucial to understanding the effects these devices have on the marine environment and to judge their potential as a mitigation measure. A study was conducted in the German North Sea, using passive acoustic monitoring and to some extent simultaneous aerial surveying to specifically study the spatial extent of the deterrence effects of a seal scarer on harbour porpoises. In order to link porpoise detections at various distances to actual sound levels, sound measurements of the seal scarer signal were carried out at several distances from the source. C-POD recordings revealed a significant deterrence effect on harbour porpoises up to 7.5 km away (at about 113 dB re 1 µParms), much further than previously reported. During seal scarer operation the number of porpoise detections within 750 m of the C-PODs decreased by between 52 and 95% of the value before the seal scarer was activated. An aerial survey revealed a significant decrease in porpoise density from 2.4 porpoises km-2 before to 0.3 porpoises km-2 during seal scarer operation within the 990 km2 study area, showing that the decrease in porpoise detections by passive acoustic monitoring was probably indeed the result of a decrease in porpoise abundance.

An acoustic deterrence device (seal scarer) was used to protect porpoises from hearing loss and bubble curtains were used to attenuate the pile-driving noise. Porpoise occurrence, quantified by echolocation signals, decreased when the seal scarer was engaged, during pile driving and up to 5 h after pile driving stopped. This effect extended out to 12 km, less than the 18-25 km reported from other pile drivings performed without bubble curtains. The bubble curtains thus effectively reduced the temporary habitat loss and risk of hearing loss. The 2 bubble curtains each attenuated the noise by between 7 and 10 dB, when used separately, and 12 dB when used together. Attenuation was most pronounced above 1 kHz, where the pile-driving noise at larger distances was comparable to or lower than ambient noise. This suggests that noise regulation should be based on frequency-weighted sound levels in addition to broadband levels, to assure that mitigation measures are effective in reducing impact on animals and not only in fulfilling legal requirements. The strong reaction to the seal scarer raises concern that it may surpass the reactions to the pile-driving noise itself, when operating with bubble curtains, and calls for a re-evaluation of the specifications of seal scarer sounds.","Bubble curtains attenuate noise from offshore wind farm construction and reduce temporary habitat loss for harbour porpoises",0

Minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) are especially at risk because they are relatively small, widely distributed, and often occur in coastal habitats where many types of fishing gear are deployed. It is unknown whether minke whales can detect and avoid ropes associated with fishing gear. To address this question we conducted a series of field experiments to measure behavioral responses of nearshore minke whales to underwater ropes simulating crab and whelk fishing gear. We also investigated correlations between whale behaviors and specific environmental variables. Our methods involved both visual and acoustic monitoring of whale behaviors near experimental ropes and buoys of different colors. A remote sensing system was also used to simultaneously monitor oceanographic conditions, record underwater sounds, and capture underwater video of whales swimming near ropes. Minke whales (N = 42) decreased their swimming velocity and altered their bearing when passing near experimental ropes, especially during trials with white and black ropes. Some minkes (N = 7) also altered their underwater swimming trajectories when passing near ropes, and often appeared to produce low-frequency vocalizations. Collectively this information provides strong evidence that minke whales detect and react behaviorally to the presence of underwater ropes that simulate fishing gear in nearshore areas. We hypothesize that visual and perhaps passive acoustic sensory abilities may be the mechanisms behind these rope avoidance behaviors. We recommend that high contrast ropes (white and black) be used with fishing gear in coastal areas to help minimize entanglements of minke and perhaps other whale species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioral responses of minke whales (<i>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</i>) to experimental fishing gear in a coastal environment",0

Pinger spacing within the areas was similar to that used in commercial fisheries. Two scenarios were tested: (1) pingers were periodically activated and deactivated during 6 periods resembling the deployment and recovery of nets in a gillnet fishery, and (2) pingers were active continuously for 28 d. Acoustic dataloggers (T-PODs) were deployed, 4 within the pinger areas and 3 in control areas, and detected porpoise echolocation activity throughout the entire study. During the periodic-exposure scenario, the porpoise detection rate was reduced by 56% when pingers were active. The reduction was larger for the SaveWave pingers (65%) than for the Airmar pingers (40%). There was a tendency for the encounter rate to increase after the first 2-4 periodic exposures, which could indicate gradual habituation. During the continuous-exposure scenario, the detection rate was reduced by 65% throughout the 28 d with no sign of habituation. In the control areas (2.5, 3 and 5 km distant), neither a decrease nor an increase in detection rate was observed, suggesting that porpoises were displaced either <2.5 km or >5 km away.

We used data from skippers' logbooks and independent observers to assess common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) bycatch patterns between 2003 and 2009 in the Pilbara Trawl Fishery, Western Australia. Both datasets indicated that dolphins were caught in all fishery areas, across all depths and throughout the year. Over the entire datasets, observer reported bycatch rates (n = 52 dolphins in 4,124 trawls, or 12.6 dolphins/1,000 trawls) were ca. double those reported by skippers (n = 180 dolphins in 27,904 trawls, or 6.5 dolphins/1,000 trawls). Generalised Linear Models based on observer data, which better explained the variation in dolphin bycatch, indicated that the most significant predictors of dolphin catch were: (1) vessel - one trawl vessel caught significantly more dolphins than three others assessed; (2) time of day - the lowest dolphin bycatch rates were between 00:00 and 05:59; and (3) whether nets included bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) - the rate was reduced by ca. 45%, from 18.8 to 10.3 dolphins/1,000 trawls, after their introduction. These results indicated that differences among vessels (or skippers' trawling techniques) and dolphin behavior (a diurnal pattern) influenced the rates of dolphin capture; and that spatial or seasonal adjustments to trawling effort would be unlikely to significantly reduce dolphin bycatch. Recent skipper's logbook data show that dolphin bycatch rates have not declined since those reported in 2006, when BRDs were introduced across the fishery. Modified BRDs, with top-opening escape hatches from which dolphins might escape to the surface, may be a more effective means of further reducing dolphin bycatch. The vulnerability of this dolphin population to trawling-related mortality cannot be assessed in the absence of an ongoing observer program and without information on trawler-associated dolphin community size, broader dolphin population size and connectivity with adjacent populations. © 2014 Allen et al.","Patterns of dolphin bycatch in a north-western Australian trawl fishery",0

Targeted agri-environment schemes (AESs) to enhance populations of threatened species inhabiting farmland have been proposed for this purpose, yet their effectiveness for nocturnal wildlife remains unknown. We assessed whether hedgerow management prescribed by targeted AESs to improve habitat conditions for the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) in England may positively influence the species, the entire bat assemblage and the insect prey of bats. We specifically investigated the responses of bats (occurrence, activity and species richness) and insects (biomass, abundance and diversity) to time since last trimming (from 1 up to 10 years). We explored the mechanisms underlying the effects of AES via changes in trimming regime on bats. Moreover, we investigated the effects of landscape context on bats as we expected that highly mobile species would benefit further from landscape-scale management. Bat species richness significantly increased with time since last trimming. Three bat taxa of major conservation concern in Western Europe substantially benefited from the targeted prescription, namely R. ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Plecotus spp. Insect family richness and dipteran abundance were also significantly greater at hedgerows that were untrimmed for at least 3 years. The activity of more common bat species (i.e. pipistrelle bats) was not influenced by time since last trimming. Changes in trimming regime strongly affected hedgerow height which directly and indirectly (by increasing prey abundance) influenced bat occurrence, activity and species richness along hedgerows. The activity of highly mobile bat species was mainly associated with a range of landscape attributes. The amount of semi-natural grassland within 0.5 km of the sampling sites positively influenced R. ferrumequinum while the presence of urban areas negatively affected light-sensitive bat species. Synthesis and applications. The implementation of targeted agri-environment schemes can include effective measures to enhance bats and their insect prey in farmland. Although we highlight the success of current prescriptions on hedgerow management, we suggest that their effectiveness can easily be optimized by encouraging farmers to keep hedgerows untrimmed for longer periods (>3 up to 10 years).

Young-of-The-year (YOY) and juvenile G. galeus were acoustically tagged and monitored to determine ontogenetic differences in residency and seasonal use of an important protected nursery area (Shark Refuge Area or SRA) in southeastern Tasmania. BothYOYand juvenile G. galeus showed a distinct seasonal pattern of occurrence in the SRAwith most departing the area during winter and only a small proportion of YOY (33%) and no juveniles returning the following spring, suggesting areas outside the SRA may also be important during these early life-history stages. While these behaviors confirm SRAs continue to function as essential habitat during G. galeus early life history, evidence of YOY and juveniles emigrating from these areas within their first 1-2 years and the fact that few YOY return suggest that these areas may only afford protection for a more limited amount of time than previously thought.

Roads also affect bats, acting as barriers to movements and causing direct mortality by collisions with vehicles. Among wildlife crossing structures existing to maintain landscape connectivity, road underpasses are considered as one of the most effective conservation measure for bats. While a few studies assessed the effects of underpass attributes on bat use, none to date has assessed the impact of landscape context on underpass use and attractiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we monitored bat activity during three consecutive nights around 24 underpasses selected along a gradient of forest cover. We compared bat activity below and above underpasses (i.e., underpass use), at road sections with and without underpasses and at habitats adjacent to roads (i.e., underpass attractiveness). We found a significant positive effect of forest cover on both underpass use and attractiveness for Myotis spp. and Barbastella barbastellus, and significant negative effects of distance to the nearest forest patch for Rhinolophus spp. and hedgerow length for Myotis spp. Our study highlights the key influence of landscape context on road underpass efficiency to maintain landscape connectivity for bats.

A large-scale multi-site study compared bat activity and key habitat variables on TG farms paired with control farms not in the scheme. Observations were made over three years (2009 to 2011) using three types of bat detector survey. Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, Myotis daubentonii, Rhinolophus hipposideros and R. ferrumequinum showed similar overall and foraging activity on TG and control farms (occurrence, intensity of activity where present). Occurrence of Nyctalus noctula and Nyctalus group was also similar on both farm types, but where they were present, the intensity of their activity was higher on control farms. The lack of influence of TG status on bat activity may reflect the close similarity in occurrence and condition of many key habitats on the two farm types and should be seen in the context of a mainly traditional extensively farmed landscape. Habitat prescriptions may have been insufficiently mature, implemented at too low density or lacking roosting provision to stimulate a species response, or may have had greater impact in a more intensively farmed landscape where less high quality bat habitat was available. A more targeted approach to creating and enhancing field and landscape scale roosting, foraging and commuting resources may be needed to effect positive responses in bat populations.","The effect of a Welsh agri-environment scheme on bat activity: a large-scale study",0

Bat carcasses are being found underneath wind turbines across North and South America, Eurasia, Africa, and the Austro-Pacific. However, relatively little is known about the comparative impacts of techniques designed to modify turbine operations in ways that reduce bat fatalities associated with wind energy facilities. This study tests a novel approach for reducing bat fatalities and curtailment time at a wind energy facility in the United States, then compares these results to operational mitigation techniques used at other study sites in North America and Europe. The study was conducted in Wisconsin during 2015 using a new system of tools for analyzing bat activity and wind speed data to make near real-time curtailment decisions when bats are detected in the area at control turbines (N = 10) vs. treatment turbines (N = 10). The results show that this smart curtailment approach (referred to as Turbine Integrated Mortality Reduction, TIMR) significantly reduced fatality estimates for treatment turbines relative to control turbines for pooled species data, and for each of five species observed at the study site: pooled data (–84.5%); eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis, –82.5%); hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus, –81.4%); silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans, –90.9%); big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus, –74.2%); and little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus, –91.4%). The approach reduced power generation and estimated annual revenue at the wind energy facility by = 3.2% for treatment turbines relative to control turbines, and we estimate that the approach would have reduced curtailment time by 48% relative to turbines operated under a standard curtailment rule used in North America. This approach significantly reduced fatalities associated with all species evaluated, each of which has broad distributions in North America and different ecological affinities, several of which represent species most affected by wind development in North America. While we recognize that this approach needs to be validated in other areas experiencing rapid wind energy development, we anticipate that this approach has the potential to significantly reduce bat fatalities in other ecoregions and with other bat species assemblages in North America and beyond.","A smart curtailment approach for reducing bat fatalities and curtailment time at wind energy facilities",0

We investigated the effectiveness of a bat box program designed to partially offset tree hollow loss from clearing for a coal mine. During the first year of monitoring, we detected bats in 5% of 1,308 box checks. Only 3 of 13 local tree cavity-roosting bat species/species groups used boxes and occupancy was not strongly associated with modeled box and site attributes. In the second year, we tested two hypotheses that may explain the relatively low box use: (1) solar exposure of boxes was inadequate for heterothermic bats and (2) available box designs were of low suitability. Relocating boxes to increase solar exposure did not increase use, or enhance the temperature profiles of relocated boxes. Introduction of a new box design led to 11 times higher use compared with existing designs for Nyctophilus spp. (long-eared bat). Overall, our data suggest that the bat box program was ineffective due to few bat species using boxes, infrequent box use by three species, and rarity of maternity roosting. The knowledge gap of species-specific box designs and roosting ecology limits the effectiveness of boxes to offset cleared hollow-bearing trees. Lack of knowledge and the widespread use of bat boxes to offset lost tree hollows highlights the need to (1) rigorously protect hollow-bearing trees and (2) advance our understanding of species-specific roost ecology, box design preferences and mechanical hollow creation into trees, before artificial hollows can be considered a meaningful offset measure.","Limited use of bat boxes in a rural landscape: implications for offsetting the clearing of hollow-bearing trees",0

The bats damaged from 440-7,040 g of litchi fruits per tree and two of the three methods reduced the fruit lost to bats: the plastic flags and the organic deterrent.

Its effectiveness was further demonstrated in flight cage experiments during which Rousettus madagascariensis avoided litchis treated with Plantskydd®.

However, the potential benefits of AES to non-target groups such as bats are unclear. In the study presented here, we assessed how the vegetative characteristics (e.g. dicot coverage and bare ground coverage) of four commonly employed AES habitat types influenced the occurrence and activity of bats. AES plots were monitored using static acoustic bat detectors and each plot was surveyed three times between April and September, with detectors set to record over three consecutive nights during each survey. Analysis of this data identified some preferences for specific AES habitat characteristics by bats, but preferences differed between species. Relationships between bats and AES habitat type were not investigated due to structural similarities between habitats which were identified through principal component analysis. Our study therefore identifies simple species-specific habitat management practices which could be implemented as part of current AES to increase the suitability of these habitats to bats. For example, habitat management targeted towards Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Barbastellus barbastellus could focus on providing floristically diverse foraging sites, which are attractive to their invertebrate prey, in close proximity to potential woodland roost sites, whilst Pipistrellus pipistrellus may benefit from AES with high dicot coverage if such habitats are located along tall field boundaries with trees, which provide shelter for their prey.","Relationships between agri-environment scheme habitat characteristics and insectivorous bats on arable farmland",0

Turtles from wet nests grew more in SCW than turtles from dry nests. Turtle growth from the 2 treatments did not differ in SCL or mass measurements. Larger initial sizes and faster SCW growth may enable the turtles to more quickly achieve a refuge size from their gape-limited predators.

Nesting and hatching data are reported here for the first 30 yrs of the research and conservation project. Because of intense nest relocation and conservation efforts, the population initially showed a steady increase in numbers, with the most dramatic rise occurring between 1997 and 2001. In spite of continued efforts, however, this recovery began to stall in the decade from 2000 to 2010. Analysis of nesting data, including specific reproductive parameters such as recruitment rate, remigration interval, and productivity (number of nests laid, hatching success) during this time frame, in conjunction with historical data, provided an opportunity to assess the contribution of these factors to the population dynamics at Sandy Point. Annual reproductive data demonstrated that regardless of overall nesting numbers, odd years consistently exhibited higher nesting numbers (115.6±18.58) than even years (68.4±7.63) (p<0.01). The average annual remigration interval increased over the study period with a record high of 3.41±0.18 yrs observed in 2008. A steady decline in average nests laid was observed (R2=0.84) between 1992 and 2010, with a record low of 3.60±2.16 nests per turtle in 2010. Hatching success varied over the 30-yr period from a project low of 40.28%±23.20% in 2005 to a record high of 67.80%±20.31% in 1991. Mean overall hatching success for the first 30 yrs of the project was 58.50%±7.75%. Hatching success declined over the course of the project, and the number of hatchlings produced per turtle declined in the 2000s. These factors contributed to a decrease in population productivity and may ultimately have inhibited continued population growth. Over the study period, a stable percentage of remigrants continued to nest at Sandy Point. However, a decreased number and percentage of neophytes was observed, suggesting either a delayed or a decreased recruitment, possibly due to increased age to sexual maturity, an increased mortality of early life stages, or a change in food resources at foraging grounds. These results suggest a population that has slowed growth and that may begin to decline in the future. Further research needs to be conducted to understand possible maternal, physiological, and environmental factors that are impacting these reproductive parameters and, ultimately, affecting the population dynamics at SPNWR.","Reproductive biology of Atlantic leatherback sea turtles at Sandy Point, St. Croix: the first 30 years",0

Ninety-five percent of the natural nests in unswept control areas (n = 20) and all of the nests in swept treatment areas (n = 16) were depredated by raccoons within 24 hrs.

However, artificial facsimiles of the surface markings left by nesting turtles, lacking cavities, were disturbed less frequently (26%, n = 19). Findings suggest that broom sweeping was ineffective because the location cues used by raccoons to find newly constructed nests are not primarily visual but olfactory and related to soil profile disturbance, possibly via the microbial metabolite geosmin.","A test of substrate sweeping as a strategy to reduce raccoon predation of freshwater turtle nests, with insights from supplemental artificial nests",0

Although substantial research has focused on the effect of the temperature during this canonical TSP, the effect of temperatures experienced before this time (pre-TSP) on the onset and duration of the TSP is less understood. Here, we incubated eggs of the endangered Magdalena River turtle, Podocnemis lewyana, under 3 relatively constant temperatures and 6 shift-twice treatments. Constant treatments included two 100% masculinizing temperatures that fostered a relatively slower and faster embryo development and one 100% feminizing temperature. The shift treatments included a masculinizing temperature and later a feminizing temperature for a period of time at different incubation stages. Sex ratios were determined by a geometric-morphometric sexing approach developed for this species and validated by gonadal histology. This technique is a nonlethal sexing alternative; thus, it contributes to the conservation of this endangered species. The sex ratios obtained under constant temperatures were more feminized than the sex ratio of another population native to a warmer climate. Shift-twice experiments revealed that pre-TSP temperatures affected the duration of the TSP and as such influenced sex determination. Specifically, at 29°C pre-TSP, the TSP lasted 20 d (28% of the incubation period), whereas at 31°C pre-TSP, the TSP was extended for 30 d (52% of the incubation period). An approximation of developmental stages based on the congeneric Podocnemis expansa is provided.

We evaluated 8 cohorts of juvenile desert tortoises from 1 to 8 yrs old in a headstart program at Edwards Air Force Base, California, for health, behavior, and growth. We also examined capacities of the headstart pens. Of 148 juveniles evaluated for health, 99.3% were below a prime condition index; 14.9% were lethargic and unresponsive; 59.5% had protruding spinal columns and associated concave scutes; 29.1% had evidence of ant bites; and 14.2% had moderate to severe injuries to limbs or shell. Lifetime growth rates for juveniles 1-8 yrs of age were approximately two times less than growth rates reported for wild populations. Tortoises in older cohorts had higher growth rates, and models indicated that high density in pens and burrow sharing negatively affected growth rates. Densities of tortoises in pens (205-2042/ha) were 350-3500 times higher than the average density recorded in the wild (<1/ha) for tortoises of similar sizes. The predominant forage species available to juveniles were alien annual grasses, which are nutritionally inadequate for growth. We conclude that the headstart pens were of inadequate size, likely contained too few shelters, and lacked the necessary biomass of preferred forbs to sustain the existing population.

Relocation can alter the incubation environment, so there is concern regarding potential modifications to embryonic development. Several studies have explored the effects of relocation on nest productivity; however, these studies often only compare reproductive output and incubation environments between relocated and in situ nests without accounting for the incubating environment of the original nest location. We assessed the differences in sand temperature, inundation exposure, grain size, and moisture content between the original and final locations of relocated nests at a loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nesting beach in Fort Morgan, Alabama, as well as differences in nest productivity between in situ and relocated nests. Differences in mean sand temperature, likelihood of inundation, and sand moisture between original-relocated locations and in situ-relocated nests were not significant. Emergence success was significantly lower in relocated vs. in situ nests, and sand grain distributions were significantly different between original and relocated nest locations. Given that relocation did not improve nest productivity nor reduce the likelihood of inundation, this practice conferred minimal net benefit to sea turtle nests on dissipative-to-intermediate beach conditions typical of the northern Gulf of Mexico. To improve the justification for nest relocation under these beach conditions, a better understanding of embryonic tolerance to inundation and clarification of relocation criteria and guidelines is required.","Potential for relocation to alter the incubation environment and productivity of sea turtle nests in the northern Gulf of Mexico",0

We analyzed each individual's dispersal over the site, its home range, and its pattern of displacement for 2 yrs after its release. About 80% of the released animals were still detected on the site 8 mo after the release operation. Home-range size was highly variable among individuals but was typical of what is known for the species. Home ranges were, however, larger in the first year after release than in the following year, probably because individuals explored the site immediately after release. The released individuals exhibited a typical displacement pattern over the first year, with a larger displacement during spring and summer that was earlier for males (April-May) than for females (June-September).

The objectives for these surveys were to 1) examine changes in population size and structure in representative upland and coastal dune habitats and 2) describe the response of gopher tortoises to land management practices (i.e., prescribed fire).

Thermal regimes during embryogenesis might therefore have direct consequences on fitness, potentially even shaping population trajectories. These effects are likely strongest in short-lived species where even temporary temperature-induced differences in body size or shape might have adaptive significance. We investigated the effects of incubation temperature on the body size and shape of hatchling Australian Painted Dragons (Ctenophorus pictus). Eggs incubated at low temperature required a longer incubation period, but produced hatchlings of greater body mass. However, no effect of temperature was found on the structural dimensions of hatchlings. These results might be explained by an increased absorption of water by the developing embryo during the prolonged incubation period. A greater water content might increase early-life desiccation tolerance in this short-lived lizard inhabiting arid and semiarid environments. Egg mass, however, had the strongest effect on hatchling phenotype, with larger eggs producing larger hatchlings. Furthermore, there was a seasonal effect on yolk allocation, with eggs laid earlier being larger than those laid later.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that neonates born earlier in the birth season are smaller (in body size, mass, or both combined as body condition) than neonates born later, but that they have more time to acquire resources before hibernation. We used 43 laboratory-born litters of Thamnophis melanogaster and 21 litters of T. eques obtained from females collected from syntopic field sites. For both species, neonate body condition at birth differed within the birth season, such that sizes were smaller in the early portion, and larger in the later portion, of the season. When compared, only the snout-vent length and mass of neonates, averaged for each litter, did not change throughout the birth season. The temporal variation in neonate body condition found in the two species could explain increased offspring survival when neonates face challenging environmental conditions. If these differences reflect variations in the environment throughout the birth season, then body condition at birth could be relevant for neonate survival.","Timing of birth and body condition in neonates of two gartersnake species from central Mexico",0

The interplay among temperature and steroid hormones is also known, and it has been suggested that stress hormones (corticosterone) might influence sex ratios in some reptiles. To explore this, we measured the levels of corticosterone in Caiman latirostris to determine if incubation temperature (31°C, 33°C, and 34°C) affects plasma corticosterone levels. Differences among nests were observed in plasma corticosterone. However, hormone levels showed no significant differences between sexes or incubation temperatures in Caiman latirostris embryos or hatchlings. Corticosterone levels were 0.01-2.2 ng/ mL in embryos incubated at 31°C (100% of females), 0.01-4.65 ng/mL in those incubated at 33°C (100% of males), and 0.01-6.31 ng/mL in embryos incubated at 34°C (100% of males). Corticosterone levels were higher in hatchlings, being 1.11-39.18 in those produced at 31°C, 2.85-22.36 at 33°C, and 2.72-39.05 ng/mL at 34°C.","Corticosterone plasma levels of embryo and hatchling broad-snouted caimans (<i>Caiman latirostris</i>) incubated at different temperatures",0

We also estimated the pivotal temperature (Tpiv) of C. latirostris from our study site. We incubated eggs at various temperatures (31°, 32°, 33°, and 34° C). Incubation temperature had a significant effect on sex determination, but had no effect in hatching success. Eggs incubated at 31° C produced 100% females, 32° C produced approximately 70% females, and incubation at 33° C and 34° C produced only males. The TRT was > 31° to < 33° C for female to male transitions, and > 34° C and a temperature > 34.5° C male to female. Results indicate that the limits of Tpiv should be between 32–33° C (lower Tpiv), and between 34–34.5° C (upper Tpiv) for the population of C. latirostris in Santa Fe, Argentina. Our analysis support the female-male-female (FMF) pattern, but higher temperature females may be rarely seen in wild because survival of females incubated at such high temperatures is very low.","New evidence characterizing temperature-dependent sex determination in broad-snouted caiman, <i>Caiman latirostris</i>",0

Freshwater turtles are considered to be susceptible species since their development is dependent on incubation temperature. In Thailand, although several species of freshwater turtle are present, the extent of their susceptibility to temperature change is unknown due to the lack of information on their developmental patterns. This research, therefore, is aimed at examining the effects of temperature on somatic development in Malayemys macrocephala, a native species and the most common freshwater turtle in Thailand. Turtle eggs were collected from rice fields in the central part of Thailand during December 2011 to February 2012 inclusive. Eggs (237-238 per condition) were incubated in microprocessor-controlled incubators at three different temperatures (26 °C, 29 °C and 32 °C) with a relative humidity in excess of 80%. Each week, until the remaining eggs hatched, eggs were randomly selected, removed and dissected to reveal the developing embryo to screen for developmental stage and any abnormalities. The incubation period (lay to hatch) was not significantly different among the three temperatures (115 ± 11.3 d, 115 ± 20.3 d and 109 ± 17.8 d, respectively), but the growth patterns, as indicated by the stages of development and carapace lengths, were significantly different. At a high temperature (32 °C), turtle embryos showed a significantly faster growth rate than at the intermediate and low temperatures (29 °C and 26 °C), but had a significantly (over 3.3-fold) higher incidence of developmental abnormalities (especially deformed bodies) than at the lower temperatures. Overall, the results indicate that incubation temperature is an important variable affecting the somatic development of this tropical freshwater turtle species, whilst abnormalities in the embryonic body may be a sensitive indicator of extreme thermal stress.","Effect of incubation temperature on the somatic development of the snail-eating turtle <i>Malayemys macrocephala</i>",0

Here, we examined how several manipulations to captive-rearing practices influence the performance of the Common Watersnake, Nerodia sipedon sipedon, during their first year in the wild. Following release, snakes that had experienced a period of enrichment during captivity to better simulate natural environments did not differ from conspecifics reared in more simplistic conditions on any measure of post-release behavior or performance. Moreover, captive snakes in both treatments exhibited habitat use, movement, thermoregulatory, and seasonal activity behaviors largely indistinguishable from resident conspecifics at the release site, and ultimately performed similarly in maintenance of body condition and survivorship. These results are in contrast to earlier releases and suggest that using older and larger individuals that have undergone a period of simulated winter dormancy may improve success during the early phase of establishment. However, captive snakes grew only one third as fast as wild native snakes, suggesting they experienced difficulties foraging in the wild. Further studies testing the effectiveness of translocation programs using captive animals as a management tool are urgently needed, but our findings do point to some success.","Experimental evaluation of captive-rearing practices to improve success of snake reintroductions",0

Embryogenesis of the two species was not sensitive to changes in the hydric environment except P. przewalskii incubated in 30°C group. Temperature significantly altered the duration of embryogenesis, with cooler temperatures leading to a longer incubation period. Hatching success was greater at 26 and 30°C than at 34°C. The hatchlings incubated at 26 and 30°C had longer snout-vent length, larger body mass, and better locomotor performance than those incubated at 34°C. Compared to P. przewalskii, P. versicolor had a shorter incubation period and yielded smaller hatchlings, which then had a higher survival rate in cooler and drier habitats. We conclude that an incubation temperature of 30°C would produce the best balance among developmental rate, hatching success, and post-hatching performance. We speculate that the upper temperature limit for incubation of P. versicolor eggs may be slightly higher than 34°C.","Effects of thermal and hydric conditions on egg incubation and hatchling phenotypes in two <i>Phrynocephalus</i> lizards",0

It is therefore important to describe the means by which sex is determined in reptile species. To date, the sex determination mechanism is not known for any species within the Anguidae, a diverse lizard family that is globally distributed. I used controlled incubation experiments to test the hypothesis that Southern Alligator Lizards (Elgaria multicarinata) display TSD. Offspring sex was assessed by direct examination of the gonads after incubation in one of five constanterature treatments (24°, 26°, 28°, 30°, and 32°C). Developmental temperature did not affect offspring sex, indicating that E. multicarinata does not display a strict form of TSD.

We determined the influence of fire on wildlife, by quantifying reptile assemblage composition in response to fire in a weedy environment characterised by very short-term fire return intervals (<2 years). We used reptiles because they are often understudied, and are only moderately vagile compared to other vertebrates, and they respond strongly to changes in vegetation structure. We repeatedly sampled 24 replicate sampling sites after they had been unburned for two years, just prior to burning (pre-burnt), just after burning (post-burnt), and up to 15 months after burning (revegetated) and monitored vegetation structure and reptile richness, abundance and assemblage composition. Our sites were not spatially auto-correlated, and were covered by native kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra), black spear grass (Heteropogon contortus), or an invasive weed (grader grass, Themeda quadrivalvis). Reptile abundance and richness were highest when sites had been unburned for 2 years, and greatly reduced in all areas post burning. The lowest reptile abundances occurred in sites dominated by the weed. Reptile abundance and richness had recovered in all grass types 15 months after burning, but assemblage composition changed. Some species were present only in before our focus fire in native grass, and their populations did not recover even 15 months post-burning. Even in fire-prone, often-burnt habitats such as our study sites, in which faunal richness and abundance were not strongly influenced by fire, reptile assemblage composition was altered. To maintain faunal biodiversity in fire-prone systems, we suggest reducing the frequency of prescribed fires, and (if possible) excluding fire from weedy invasions if it allows native grasses to return.","Short-term responses of reptile assemblages to fire in native and weedy tropical savannah",0

The detection of hatchlings and subadult classes that are smaller than these released animals in the rivers indicates that there is natural recruitment. Therefore, collecting all nests for ex-situ breeding might not be the best strategy until more rigorous field assessments are completed to determine the relative contributions of captive-bred versus natural recruitment. We suggest that more effort should be channeled toward field assessments, including mapping and monitoring habitat availability, habitat management to ensure necessary environmental flows to create sand banks and deep pools, and research to better understand the ecology and behavior of Gharials in Nepal's rivers.","Conservation and population recovery of gharials (<i>Gavialis gangeticus</i>) in Nepal",0

The total species richness was similar in both treatments; however, the composition varied between sites with different recovery times. Higher abundance of amphibian was presented on sites with the low-intensity treatment, while reptiles were more abundant at sites with intensive treatment. Compared to a mature forest without management, sites with intensive treatment have more rare species, although the values of true diversity of amphibians were similar between treatments with different intensities, while for reptiles sites under treatment showed less diversity that unmanaged site: 33 % for intensive treatment and 28 % at sites with low intensity with respect to one control site. Complementary Analysis showed a difference of 86 % between the compositions of species in sites with intensive treatment.

In newly established populations, such as when animals are translocated for conservation, dispersal and availability of resources influence patterns of abundance. We developed a process to estimate population size using N-mixture models and spatial models for newly established and dispersing populations. We used our approach to estimate the population size of critically endangered St. Croix ground lizards (Ameiva polops) five years after translocation of 57 individuals to Buck Island, an offshore island of St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands. Estimates of population size incorporated abiotic variables, dispersal limits, and operative environmental temperature available to the lizards to account for low species detection. Operative environmental temperature and distance from the translocation site were always important in fitting the N-mixture model indicating effects of dispersal and species biology on estimates of population size. We found that the population is increasing its range across the island by 5-10% every six months. We spatially interpolated site-specific abundance from the N-mixture model to the entire island, and we estimated 1,473 (95% CI, 940-1,802) St. Croix ground lizards on Buck Island in 2013 corresponding to survey results. This represents a 26-fold increase since the translocation. We predicted the future dispersal of the lizards to all habitats on Buck Island, with the potential for the population to increase by another five times in the future. Incorporating biologically relevant covariates as explicit parameters in population models can improve predictions of population size and the future spread of species introduced to new localities.","Dispersal and population state of an endangered island lizard following a conservation translocation",0

Scientists should therefore test a variety of translocation methods to reduce dispersal when moving wildlife between sites. The objective of this research was to examine how translocation method (hard- vs. soft-release) and habitat structure (continuous vs. patchy) affect movement of translocated turtles. A hard-release consists of releasing individuals to their new environment without any prior acclimation, whereas a soft-release forces animals to spend time at the release site prior to release. Our results suggest that the most effective translocation technique depends upon habitat structure. A soft-release was effective in minimizing post-release dispersal of translocated turtles in a continuous lotic habitat as there was no difference in the movement of soft-released and resident turtles. However, hard-released turtles undergo extensive movement when translocated to a continuous lotic habitat as hard-released turtles had greater movement than resident turtles. When the release site consists of a patchy wetland complex, a hard-release translocation may be effective as there was no difference in the movement between resident and hard-released turtles. Our study suggests that both the habitat structure of the release site and translocation method play a role in the movement patterns of translocated wildlife. Semi-aquatic turtles or species with poor vagility may make better candidates for hard-release translocations in patchy habitats because these species may be less likely or unable to disperse long distances as result of their behavior, physiology, or the structure of the release site.","Movement of translocated turtles according to translocation method and habitat structure",1

We have analyzed the response of a reptile community to thinning management in pine plantations within the Sierra Nevada National Park (SE Spain). Surveyed plots covered a gradient of tree densities (according treatments) from unlogged plots, 50% logged trees, 66% logged trees, and surrounding areas of open landscape with sparse trees. Four replicates (plots) were considered per treatment, with 4 visits per plot. In each plot, we measured three reptile community metrics, species richness, abundance, and Pielou's evenness. We hypothesize that reptile metrics will increase with the reduction of pine density and canopy, and an increase of solar radiation. Our results showed a negligible response after a 50% thinning, but a significant response of the reptile community after a 66% reduction.

We quantified the success rates for 1700 sea turtles admitted to rehabilitation facilities in Florida (USA) between 1986 and 2004. Rehabilitation success was low: 61.5% of turtles died in rehabilitation and only 36.8% were released back into the wild. A further 1.6% of turtles were maintained in captivity permanently due to the severe nature of their injuries. Most mortality occurred early during the rehabilitation process (within a few weeks), and successful rehabilitation often took several months to more than 3 yr.

At face value, the low rates of rehabilitated turtles successfully released back into the wild may contribute only modestly to conservation in terms of contributing to population viability. However, many rehabilitation facilities provide important educational experiences that increase public awareness of the threats facing animals and highlight potential conservation solutions.

However, visual camouflage – coloration that conceals individuals from predators or prey – is another important ecological requirement that has been largely overlooked. We provide a case study to illustrate how color patterns of a prey species can change from that of the source site following translocation. Shore skinks (Oligosoma smithi) were moved from a coastal sand dune ecosystem to an offshore island beach that differed in substrate and color. Within one year following release, the translocated population's color pattern variation had reduced to mostly one pattern type. The high match in color patterns between the skinks and release site (including a new substrate type) may have contributed to the observed color pattern shift. This reduced variation in color pattern implies that not all founders survived, potentially decreasing the genetic diversity in the population.

We tested if long-term survival rates differ between released and resident individuals, if survival was lower during the phase of establishment (i.e. release cost), how long acclimation lasts and if increased density due to releases affects survival. We found lower survival of released tortoises during the phase of establishment (1 to 3 years) when residents were already present. After establishment, survival was very high and unaffected by density-dependence. Body condition before release was similar between recaptured and dead/missing tortoises, and did not predict establishment survival. Stochastic population viability analysis showed that success when releasing small numbers of individuals strongly depends upon adult long-term survival. Release of small second batches of tortoises was not sensitive to a growing population, regardless of its release timing. Our results highlight long-term survival as crucial in translocation projects of long-lived species, invalidating short-term (first year) survival assessment, when survival release cost does not match long-term survival. A release cost of different duration should be included in model estimation before modeling predictions. Releasing tortoises (for welfare of captive individuals or for mitigating human negative impacts) in an already established population is not recommended under most circumstances. Acclimation cost is followed by survival approaching wild counterparts.

Unfortunately, these habitats have been dramatically altered over the past several decades for practical and esthetic reasons. Continued rapid growth of suburban areas has accelerated this shift in habitat quality. Management strategies that promote shrub habitat within developed areas are rarely greeted with public acceptance because bushy thickets (e.g. Rubus brambles) shelter undesired species of animals (e.g. snakes, small mammals) and are typically associated with a lack of property maintenance. We conducted an experiment in a heavily impacted suburban habitat (population density of ~2700humans/km2). Our study site, containing forest and meadow habitats, was adjacent to a large city (~320,000 inhabitants) and visited by >70,000 people annually. We manipulated the forest habitat by removing trees, and through active maintenance, thereby promoting the growth of brambles. Within six years, we observed that newly-created shrub habitat was rapidly colonized by snakes, notably Vipera aspis. The total number of detected individuals increased markedly over time. Numerous advertising and educational activities about snake ecology were conducted in parallel, especially with school children. Complaints from the public were absent which demonstrates that management strategies that favor unpopular organisms are feasible, even in densely populated areas.","Forest management bolsters native snake populations in urban parks",0

Although artificial refuges are intended to support particular species, they may be equally attractive and accessible to others, including predators. We explored the influence of snake predation risk and shelter attributes on the overnight use of different artificial refuges (timber, tiles, and iron) using the predator-prey relationship between Boulenger's skink, Morethia boulengeri and the curl snake, Suta suta. We collected adult M. boulengeri from two bioregions in south-eastern Australia: the Riverina, where the two species co-occur, and the South Western Slopes, where S. suta does not occur. Two adult S. suta were collected for use as chemical donors. We conducted four experiments on overnight refuge choice to determine: (i) predator-scent avoidance, (ii) artificial refuge preferences, (iii) a trade-off between a preferred refuge and predator-avoidance, and (iv) the effect of gap height on refuge preference. We found that skinks avoided predator-scented refuges in favour of identical, but unscented refuges. Skinks preferred timber refuges, and most skinks maintained this preference when predator-scent was added. However, when gap height was manipulated, skinks shifted to the refuge with the smallest gap. Skinks displayed complex regional variation in behaviour; skinks from both bioregions avoided predator-scent, but in the trade-off experiment, skinks from the South Western Slopes were less likely to avoid predator-scented timber refuges than those from the Riverina. Our findings suggest that protective refuge attributes, such as small gap height, can offset the risk implied by predator-scent within a refuge.

We measured the diversity and abundance of reptiles and amphibians, and quantified temperature and humidity during an experiment that repeatedly grazed, burnt, or burnt and grazed para grass in a replicated series of experimental plots. All burnt plots were drier and sites that were both burnt and grazed were hotter. The frog and reptile community was dominated by a few common species. Richness changed seasonally and was strongly related to the distance from the nearest woodland and free water, but it was unaffected by the management treatments. Abundance of the skink (. Lampropholis delicata) and frog (. Limnodynastes convexiusculus) decreased with burning and grazing, while a closely related frog (. Limnodynastes tasmaniensis) remained unaffected. There was a clear trade-off between decreasing the abundance of a few common species to increase the overall suitability of habitat for a diversity of native species.

On the basis of generalized estimating equation mixed models, maximum daily tortoise temperature increased with environmental temperature then leveled off at highest environmental temperatures for all three groups (translocated, resident, and control) likely due to behavioral thermoregulation. This pattern was consistent among groups, but translocated tortoises had higher average maximum daily temperature and durations above 35 °C than resident and control tortoises in the first month post-translocation, with smaller effects in the second and fourth months, and no differences in subsequent years. During the first year, adult translocated males had higher temperatures than females. Average percent changes in body condition and carapace length increased post-translocation for all groups and there were no differences in mortality probability among groups or years. Based on the relatively short-term thermal effects, and lack of negative effects on condition, growth, or mortality, our study suggests relatively minimal impacts following short-distance translocation releases in spring.

The NGR population increased from an absolute abundance of 348 (±3.4; an estimate of precision based on 1 SE) in the early 1970s to maximum absolute abundance of 992 (±58.7) in 1994 as a result of a restocking program initiated in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The population structure is currently skewed towards subadults and adults and the current population is in decline. This is a result of low recruitment levels in NGR, which are unable to sustain the artificially high population size created by the restocking program. Also contributing to this decline is the poaching of crocodiles and destruction of suitable and historical nest sites. Sex ratios were skewed toward females in juveniles and subadults and toward males in adults, while the overall sex ratio in the population was even. The current NGR Nile Crocodile population is estimated at an absolute abundance of 846 (±263).

Monitoring the results of reintroductions is critical to be able to assess short- and long-term success, adjusting management decisions as new information becomes available. In this study, we assessed the first 15 years of the captive breeding and restocking program for the European pond turtle Emys orbicularis in Liguria, northern Italy. We estimated survival of released turtles by modelling mark-recapture monitoring data. We then used those estimates to update our prior expectations about long-term outcomes, and to adjust management decisions about the age of individuals to release. Modelling results suggest released turtles had sufficiently high survival, matching prior expectations, such that local extinction has been averted in the short-term. Survival was similar among candidate age classes for releases, suggesting the release of younger individuals can provide positive outcomes while reducing management costs. On the other hand, survival varied among sites, indicating the need for ongoing in-situ habitat management to ensure long-term persistence. Moreover, the late onset of sexual maturity in the species means reproduction of released animals cannot yet be determined with certainty.

Bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) that narrow the funnel opening on crab pots exclude terrapins, but BRDs face opposition from the fishing industry due to fears that they will decrease target species catch. The primary goals of this research were to examine the efficacy of two sizes of BRDs in excluding terrapins from crab pots and to assess the impact of BRDs on blue crab catch. Crab pots were deployed in paired and triplicate designs at estuarine sites along the central and southern coast of North Carolina in the summers of 2012 and 2013.

This is largely because the limited quantity of research that has been conducted on animal reintroductions has shown varying degrees of success in establishing new populations. The reasons why some reintroductions are successful, whereas others are not, are often not clear. Aims The present research aims to determine whether reptile reintroduction into restored mine pits is a potential management technique for managing and conserving reptile populations within a mined landscape. Methods Twelve Napoleon's skinks were trapped then fitted with 0.9-g transmitters. Half were reintroduced into 5-year-old restored mine pits and the other half into unmined forest. Bodyweights, movement patterns and macro-habitat selection were recorded weekly during November and then monthly until March. Key results Skinks reintroduced into restored sites quickly moved into unmined forest. Both groups of skinks moved large distances, but those reintroduced into restored sites travelled further than did control skinks and took longer to reduce their distances travelled, showing possible stress as a result of release into unsuitable habitat. Eventually, almost all skinks found suitable habitat in unmined forest and settled into these areas while continuing to gain weight. Conclusions Reintroduction was an ineffective technique for facilitating colonisation of restored minesites by Napoleon's skink. Lack of suitable micro-habitats within restoration areas, such as ground logs and coarse, woody debris piles, is likely limiting the use of these areas by Napoleon's skinks and is likely to be the cause of their failure to remain or settle in restored sites after reintroduction. Implications Determining the habitat requirements of skinks and replicating this in restoration sites would seem the more appropriate management option than is reintroduction, and this may be the case for other reptiles and habitat specialists. © 2011 CSIRO.","Movement patterns by <i>Egernia napoleonis</i> following reintroduction into restored jarrah forest",0

Within the tuna and swordfish fisheries, the incidental sea turtle bycatch is usually more frequent from longline fisheries targeting swordfish. Therefore it is important to test possible mitigation measures, particularly in areas where fishing activities and high abundance of these species overlaps, as is the case of the Tropical Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Between August 2008 and December 2011, a total of 202 experimental pelagic longline sets were carried out in that region (latitude: 11-22°N, longitude: 20-38°W). The aim was to test the effects of changing the traditional J-style hooks (10° offset) baited with squid used by the fishing industry, against two circle hooks (one non-offset and one with 10° offset) and mackerel bait. Four sea turtle species were captured, with the leatherback Dermochelys coriacea comprising most of the bycatches (BPUE, bycatch per unit of effort using the traditional configuration of 0.990 turtles/1000 hooks), followed by three hardshell species: the loggerhead Caretta caretta and the olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea (BPUE. =. 0.165 turtles/1000 hooks), and the Kemp ridley Lepidochelys kempii (BPUE. =. 0.024 turtles/1000 hooks). In general, the sea turtle interactions in the fishery can be reduced by changing from the traditional gear to one of the experimental combinations. However, those reductions were species-specific, with the leatherback bycatches reduced only when changing from J-style to the non-offset circle hook, while for the hardshell turtles both the hook style (using a circle hook, with or without offset) and the bait (using mackerel) significantly reduced the incidental bycatches. Hooking location was also species-specific, with most hardshell specimens hooked by the mouth and esophagus, while leatherbacks were mostly hooked externally by the flippers. Most of the sea turtles were captured and released alive with the mortality rates independent of the hook style and bait type used. A reduction of 55% in leatherback incidental bycatches can be expected in this fishery by changing from J-style to circle hooks, whereas for the hardshell species a 50-59% reduction can be obtained by changing to circle hooks (respectively with and without offset), and a 55% reduction by using mackerel bait.","Effects of hook and bait in a tropical northeast Atlantic pelagic longline fishery: Part I-Incidental sea turtle bycatch",1

The Georgian Bay, Ontario population of the eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus) is designated as Threatened, in part because of high road mortality. In Killbear Provincial Park, four ecopassages and barrier fencing were constructed along three busy park roads to reduce road mortality of massasaugas. Aim Although mitigation of road mortality has been widely recommended and in some instances implemented for reptiles, effectiveness of mitigation efforts is often inadequately evaluated. The goals of our study were to use long-term data to quantify the effectiveness of ecopassages and barrier fencing in reducing massasauga fatalities on roads, and to evaluate the potential of these structures to serve as movement corridors for individual snakes. Methods We used five approaches to assess the overall efficacy of mitigation efforts: (1) comparison of pre- and post-mitigation road mortality; (2) camera traps in ecopassages to document massasauga and predator presence; (3) automated tag readers in ecopassage entrances to detect PIT-tagged individuals; (4) an experiment to assess massasauga willingness to enter and travel through ecopassages; and (5) measurement of temperature fluctuations in ecopassages to assess thermal suitability for massasaugas. Key results We found a significant decrease in road mortality of massasaugas on stretches of park roads associated with ecopassages and barrier fencing post construction. Automated tag readers and cameras detected the presence of massasaugas and other animals within the ecopassages, and experimental data showed that massasaugas willingly entered, and in some cases crossed through, ecopassages. Conclusion Our evaluation of mitigation structures determined that they successfully reduce road mortality and provide potential movement corridors between bisected habitats, provided that intense maintenance of the fencing is conducted yearly.

It harbors the largest nesting population (>800 females) in the USA. It is an important rookery for Atlantic leatherback recovery efforts. For the past 30 yr, the beach has been continuously monitored and managed in order to increase hatchling recruitment and conservation. Our study highlights how a multiyear change in the natural disturbance cycle has affected dune plant growth and leatherback production at this beach. Reduced summer erosion relaxed natural control of Ipomoea pes-caprae, a native dune plant, allowing its seaward spread to cover >75% of the nesting beach. This spread of vegetation led to both direct and indirect interactions between nesting leatherbacks and I. pes-caprae. Because the beach is managed in order to protect leatherback nests, a dune vegetation control plan was needed. We measured the effects of 3 vegetation management options on nest success: herbicide treatment, aboveground mechanical removal, and undisturbed vegetation. These treatments were compared to nest success at a non-vegetated control site. We found that the spread of I. pes-caprae reduced nesting habitat and nest productivity.

The commercial use of saltwater crocodiles Crocodylus porosus is a growing industry in Australia's Northern Territory. Although Indigenous people sell crocodile eggs and hatchlings, the majority of harvesting and incubation is done by non-indigenous people from less remote areas. One Indigenous community has been heavily involved in this industry and now manages its own harvest and incubation programme. We present a case study of this programme, which has transitioned from outside agencies managing the harvest, to complete local ownership and management. Egg harvests and incubation success rates declined by 40% following the switch to local management. Income increased, as did production costs; in particular, royalty payments made to Indigenous landowners. The declines reflect the community's motives for engaging in the industry, which have been socially rather than commercially driven, and damage to nesting habitat by feral animals. The increase in royalties reflects the need to compete with non-indigenous harvesters from outside the township, who are strictly commercially driven.

In a seawater tank, far fewer crabs entered crab pots fitted with red plastic by-catch reduction devices (BRDs), relative to pots without BRDs. Crab retention times, however, were significantly longer in pots fitted with red BRDs. In a second experiment, fewer terrapins entered crab pots with funnels painted red relative to black. From a field pilot study, the legal crab catch from pots with red BRDs was similar to pots without BRDs, and terrapin by-catch was reduced. Relative to those treatments, fewer crabs and more terrapins were captured in pots with orange BRDs and blue BRDs, and in pots with a magnetic field directed into the funnel openings. Based on these results, a final field trial yielded comparable crab catch from 15 pots without BRDs and 15 pots fitted with red plastic BRDs. Of a by-catch of 68 terrapins, 58 were from pots without BRDs.

We investigated filters through a long-term study examining reptile and mammal recolonization of, and population persistence in, post-mining restoration in the northern jarrah forest of southwestern Australia. Neither mammal community composition, nor individual mammal species, differed between unmined forest and restoration but reptile communities did and some reptile species were significantly less abundant in restoration than in unmined forest. We concluded that there were no filters to mammal recolonization and persistence but that there were both unidirectional (decreasing gradually over time) and dynamic (fluctuating over time) filters to reptile recolonization of post-mining restoration that influenced both recolonization and population persistence of some reptile species. Low volumes of coarse woody debris appeared to be a unidirectional filter that will slow recolonization by some reptile species for decades or even centuries. Canopy cover appeared to be a dynamic filter that fluctuated over a period of >7 years and precluded population persistence of some reptile species that had already recolonized the post-mining restoration. A dearth of studies made it difficult to generalize how widespread these filters were in restoration areas but studies of thinning and burning in natural forests suggested they were likely to be widespread.

Integrated modeling approaches can improve estimation of demographic rates necessary for making predictions, even for rare or cryptic species with sparse data, but their use in management applications is limited. We developed integrated models for a population of diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) impacted by road-associated threats to (i) jointly estimate demographic rates from two mark-recapture datasets, while directly estimating road mortality and the impact of management actions deployed during the study; and (ii) project the population using population viability analysis under simulated management strategies to inform decision-making. Without management, population extirpation was nearly certain due to demographic impacts of road mortality, predators, and vegetation. Installation of novel flashing signage increased survival of terrapins that crossed roads by 30%. Signage, along with small roadside barriers installed during the study, increased population persistence probability, but the population was still predicted to decline. Management strategies that included actions targeting multiple threats and demographic rates resulted in the highest persistence probability, and roadside barriers, which increased adult survival, were predicted to increase persistence more than other actions. Our results support earlier findings showing mitigation of multiple threats is likely required to increase the viability of declining populations.

Based on a long-term, large-scale fire experiment, we investigated the effects of different fire regimes on the demography of the gymnophthalmid Micrablepharus atticolus, an endemic lizard of the Cerrado. Because M. atticolus is more abundant in open habitats, we predicted that frequent burns should favor its populations. Over eight years, we conducted a mark-recapture study using pitfall trap arrays in five 10 ha plots of cerrado sensu stricto, subjected to prescribed burns. Using generalized linear mixed-models of time series data and an information theoretic approach to select demographic models, we describe the life history of M. atticolus and assess the response of apparent survival, detectability, and recruitment to burn regimes and climate variation. Micrablepharus atticolus has an annual life cycle, with complete annual population turnover; breeding takes place during the dry season, when activity is higher, and hatchlings appear in the wet season. Apparent survival, detectability, and recruitment increased in the short-run after the passage of fire in all experimental plots.

Evidence suggests that longer time in captivity may negatively affect an animal's post-release behaviour and survival. However, environmental enrichment may reduce the deleterious effects of captivity for animals that are going to be released into the wild. Aims The aim of the present study was to compare first-year post-release survival and behaviour of translocated ratsnakes (Pantherophis obsoletus) held captive for varying durations (1-7 years) either with or without enrichment, with that of resident and wild-to-wild (W-W)-translocated ratsnakes. Key results Being in captivity before release negatively affected survival; 11 of 19 (57.9%) captive snakes died or were removed from the study within 12 months, compared with 3 of 11 (27.3%) resident snakes and none of five (0%) W-W snakes. Furthermore, survival probability declined the longer a snake had been in captivity. Six of the seven snakes (86%) that we released that had been in captivity for four or more years before release died during this study, regardless of whether they were enriched or not. Although W-W-translocated ratsnakes moved more often and further than did snakes in other groups, this difference was apparent only in the first month post-release. We found no evidence that abnormal movement patterns or winter behaviour was the cause of reduced survival for captive snakes. Instead, our data suggested that spending time in captivity reduced concealment behaviour of snakes, which likely increased the vulnerability of snakes to predators. Captivity also compromised the foraging ability of some of the snakes.

Conclusions Our results suggested that environmental enrichment did not offset the negative effects of captivity on ratsnakes and that the likely mechanism responsible for low survival was vulnerability to predators.

There is abundant evidence that wildlife makes use of such structures as safe passages to cross roads. We analyzed the spatial relationship between road drainage elements (N = 253; mostly culverts) as potential faunal underpasses, and mortality due to vehicle collisions in two seasons and on four relatively low-traffic roads (<5000 cars/day) traversing oak rangelands of western Andalusia (S Spain). Focusing on amphibians, reptiles and mammals, we recorded and located casualties (N = 238 individuals, 35 species) along these roads, identifying and characterizing all potential underpasses. Overall frequencies of casualties and spatial distribution were highly variable both within and among these roads. We obtained an estimation of potential permeability for the different roads. We detected, located and described a wide supply and a very variable pattern of drainage culverts and other underpasses, with differences among roads in passage attributes potentially affecting permeability for wildlife, such as spatial arrangement, number, density (frequency or concentration of passages) and dimensions. We used Mantel tests to assess spatial congruence of passages and road-killed animals. We applied generalized linear mixed models fitted by maximum likelihood through Akaike Information Criterion to explain the variation in the distance of the 238 casualties to the nearest underpasses, with road transect and season as random factors, and traffic intensity, speed and vertebrate class as fixed effects. Both road-killed animals and underpass distribution followed aggregated patterns, and casualties were not significantly related to underpasses along any of the 4 roads. There were no differences in distance of casualties to the nearest underpass for the three vertebrate classes. Although existing underpasses were abundant, we could not correlate potential permeability with reduced mortality along these roads, and other factors potentially affecting roadkill aggregations should be evaluated along with permeability assessment. Mitigation of road-caused mortality can still be greatly improved for these roads, through measures of reconditioning and proper management of existing underpasses, aiming to maximize road permeability and reducing major impacts upon animal populations of Andalusian rangelands.","Is vertebrate mortality correlated to potential permeability by underpasses along low-traffic roads?",1

Using a formal experimental design, we characterized vegetation, surface temperature, moisture, and snake occurrence in control and burned treatments before and after prescribed fire. Prescribed fire increased vegetative cover and thereby decreased ground temperature compared to pre-treatment and control conditions, whereas rattlesnake occurrence increased dramatically after the prescribed fire. A habitat suitability model indicated that snake presence was negatively affected by forb cover, which became more dominant relative to other vegetation in the absence of fire. Prescribed fire also increased the cover of legumes and maintained graminoid cover and high overall plant functional diversity-all of which decreased in the absence of fire.

Turtle abundance at restored sites was more than twice that of references sites and trends existed in the distribution of turtle species, but neither abundance nor composition was found to be statistically different. Habitat characteristics that affect turtle communities were not equivalent between sites, with reference streams having higher canopy cover, and lower total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and total suspended solids than restored streams. Mantel’s test and non-metric multidimensional scaling plots indicated that turtle composition was significantly correlated with habitat and vegetation, and that turtle communities were generally separated between restored and reference streams.

Two counties in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) accounted for 66.1% of known wild turtle harvest in 1999, with no reported harvest in subsequent years. We sampled 60 sites in the LRGV to determine if we could detect harvest effects.

Based on a GIS analysis of water bodies throughout the entire state, we estimated that only 2.2% of water bodies are protected under the current commercial harvest regulations. We determined source water bodies could supply 30.5% of sink water bodies in the LRGV, and we concluded that long-term sustainable turtle harvest is unlikely under the current management regime due to the intensity of commercial harvests, the low number of protected water bodies, and non-robust or non-interactive protected populations.

We simulated a translocation site for an Endangered Australian skink, the pygmy bluetongue lizard Tiliqua adelaidensis, to investigate whether adding food would encourage released individuals to disperse less. We provided artificial burrows in a central release area within circular cages and found that lizards were more likely to remain in a burrow, spent less time exposed on the ground surface and were less likely to move out of the central area when food was provided. These modified behaviours are likely to encourage translocation success if lizards with added food expose themselves less frequently to predators, and if fewer of those lizards disperse away from the translocation site in the early days after release.

However, declines in populations of wild pollinator species, largely driven by the conversion of natural habitat to agricultural land and broad-spectrum pesticide use often lead reductions in the provision of pollination services and crop production. With growing evidence that targeted pollinator conservation improves crop yield and/or quality, particularly for pollination specialist crops, efforts are increasing to substitute agriculturally intensive practices with those that alleviate some of the negative impacts of agriculture on pollinators and the pollination services they provide, in part through the provision of suitable pollinator habitat. Further, similarities between the responses of some pollinators and predators to habitat management suggest that efforts to conserve pollinators may also encourage predator densities. We evaluated the effects of one habitat management practice, the addition of cacao fruit husks to a monoculture cacao farm, on the provision of pollination services and the densities of two groups of entomophagous predators. We also evaluated the impacts of cacao fruit husk addition on pollen limitation, by crossing this habitat manipulation with pollen supplementation treatments. The addition of cacao fruit husks increased the number of fruits per tree and along with hand pollination treatments, increased final yields indicating a promotion of the pollination ecosystem service provided by the specialist pollinators, midges. We also found that cacao fruit husk addition increased the densities of two predator groups, spiders and skinks. Further, the conservation of these predators did not inhibit pollination through pollinator capture or deterrence. The findings show that, with moderate habitat management, both pollinator and predator conservation can be compatible goals within a highly specialized plant-pollinator system. The effectiveness of this habitat manipulation may be attributable to the increased availability of alternative habitat and food resources for both pollinators and predators. The results exemplify a win-win relationship between agricultural production and biological conservation, whereby agricultural practices to support vital pollinators and pollination services can increase production as well as support species conservation.","Increased pollinator habitat enhances cacao fruit set and predator conservation",0

The number of nests increased 200% and the number of false crawls increased 55% in the experimental section, whereas a corresponding increase in number of nests and false crawls was not observed in the other two sections where debris removal was not conducted.

The broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) has become Australia's most endangered snake due to a dependence on rock habitats that are subject to high rates of human-induced degradation. The permanence of degradation can only be reversed by outcrop restoration. We constructed experimental outcrops near (<150 m) and far (>500 m) from roads and walking trails (access points). We tested two hypotheses over a 14-year period: that outcrop restoration can restore habitat quality, and that the frequency of outcrop degradation is influenced by distance from access points. We confirmed that habitat value was restored: lizard prey of the broad-headed snake was more abundant in constructed compared to natural outcrops; broad-headed snakes were detected equally in constructed and natural outcrops. Disturbance to constructed outcrops occurred more often and was more severe at near compared to far outcrops. The probability of occupancy by broad-headed snakes was 0.75 ± 0.13 in 29 far outcrops compared to 0.41 ± 0.11 in 35 near outcrops, suggesting a response to disturbance and more frequent poaching at near outcrops. Habitat restoration for the broad-headed snake should have its greatest value at locations far from access points. Restricting access should be a principal strategy to manage rock outcrop ecosystems.

We used drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps in a replicated Before-After-Control-Impact design to experimentally assess herpetofaunal community response to initial application of three silvicultural methods proposed to promote oak regeneration: prescribed burning; midstory herbicide; and shelterwood harvests (initial treatment of the shelterwood-burn method) and controls, before and for five years post-treatment. Species richness of all herpetofauna, amphibians, reptiles, frogs, salamanders, or snakes was unaffected by any treatment, but lizard species richness increased in the shelterwood harvest.

In contrast, capture rate of total lizards and Plestiodon fasciatus increased in shelterwood stands within the first year post-harvest. Prescribed burn and midstory herbicide treatments did not affect any reptile or amphibian species. A marginally lower proportion of juvenile to adult P. teyahalee, and a higher proportion of juvenile P. fasciatus in shelterwood than control units suggested that heavy canopy removal and associated change in microclimate may differentially affect reproductive success among species.

We documented no adverse effects of either growing-season burns or dormant-season burns on any common herpetofaunal taxa, but capture rates of total, adult, and juvenile five-lined skinks (Plestiodon fasciatus) were greater following growing-season burns. Most measurements reflected little or transient change in forest structure. However, canopy cover decreased by an average of 16% in growing-season burns within four growing-seasons of burning, with some tree mortality in patches where fire temperature likely was hotter. Our study suggests that even modest reductions in canopy cover may positively affect relative abundance and reproductive success of P. fasciatus. We cautiously suggest that a higher mean ground-level fire temperature and the physiologically active condition of vegetation in growing-season burns interacted to damage a greater proportion of trees, resulting in more canopy thinning than in dormant-season burns. However, weather, fuel types and condition, vegetation structure, and topography interact to affect fire intensity and the level of mortality or damage to canopy trees within and among stands, regardless of season conducted.

These measures have been associated with reduced hatching rates, altered hatchling sex ratio, fetal dysmorphic anatomical features, and feeble hatchlings health. Previous studies have shown that MMN and natural nests (NN) provide different incubatory conditions. Therefore, incubatory challenges imposed by MMN conditions on fetal development could induce stress responses affecting hatchlings functional morphology later on life. There is no evidence of incubatory stress associated with conservation measures in turtle fetuses or hatchlings. Thus, in this paper we tested the hypothesis that MMN incubation exposes turtle fetuses to stressing conditions. Given that the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis begins functioning by day 11 of incubation in reptiles, our experiments explored the effects of incubatory conditions, rather than those associated with translocation, on fetal stress responses. We showed that Lepidochelys olivacea hatchlings incubated in MMN displayed reduced body weight, hypertrophic inter-renal glands, testicular hypotrophy and hypotrophic dorso-medial cortical pyramidal neurons, when compared with hatchlings emerging from NN. Furthermore, MMN hatchlings had higher serum levels of corticosterone at emergence, and displayed an attenuated acute stress response after traversing the beach. Therefore, the relocation of nests to protect them could negatively impact the health and survival of sea turtles.

The numerical abundance of C. constrictor in burned habitat was nearly twice that in the control. In both treatments, C. constrictor was associated with areas that were more open, had less canopy cover, more new vegetative growth, and less, shallower leaf litter. However, the availability of these habitats was greater in the burn treatment. Snakes were more surface active in the burn treatment and tended to be more arboreal in the control treatment. Differences in available habitat may have caused an increase in surface activity in the burn treatment, which could have biased detection rates and created higher apparent abundance in the burned treatment. Females moved more often in the control treatment, which may be due to a lack of preferred thermal habitat and reproductive thermoregulatory demands. Ultimately, fire changed habitat availability and altered the movement rates and behavior of C. constrictor causing ecological effects that may not be detected when researchers only compare abundance.","Effects of a landscape disturbance on the habitat use and behavior of the black racer",0

Changes in vegetation structure such as a decrease in canopy cover or an increase in herbaceous cover from prescribed fire can increase availability of preferred microhabitats for some species while simultaneously reducing preferred conditions for others. We examined the responses of herpetofaunal communities to prescribed fires in an oak/hickory forest in western Kentucky. Prescribed fires were applied twice to a 1000-ha area one and four years prior to sampling, causing changes in vegetation structure. Herpetofaunal communities were sampled using drift fences, and vegetation attributes were sampled via transects in four burned and four unburned plots. Differences in reptile community structure correlated with variation in vegetation structure largely created by fires. Amphibian community structure differed on a yearly basis, indicating that sampled communities were likely influenced by environmental factors other than the burning. We found taxa-specific differences in abundances for Coluber constrictor, Diadophis punctatus, Sceloporus undulatus, Lithobates clamitans and snakes as a group, being more abundant in burned areas while Anaxyrus sp., Notophthalmus viridescens and Plethodon glutinosus were more abundant in unburned areas. Differences in amphibian taxa abundances may have been influenced by availability of aquatic breeding habitat and yearly weather variation. Our results suggest that the vegetation structure changes caused by prescribed fire can have indirect impacts on reptile abundances and community structure, while not significantly impacting amphibian communities.","Response of reptile and amphibian communities to the reintroduction of fire in an oak/hickory forest",0

Therefore, we investigated summer herpetofaunal responses to factorial combinations of dormant-season prescribed fire and a commonly used herbicide (imazapyr) with a randomized complete block design of 6 mid-rotation pine stands with 4 experimental units in Mississippi, USA, to which we applied at random 1 of 4 treatments (i.e., burn only, herbicide only, burn+herbicide, control). We captured 814 reptiles and 3,699 amphibians of 17 and 16 species, respectively, using drift-fence arrays during May and June, 1999-2007. Herpetofaunal assemblages only differed between burn+herbicide and control plots in 2002. Species-specific responses were limited to differences across years within treatments and greater eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) relative abundance in burned or herbicide-treated sites soon after treatment. Furthermore, herpetofaunal associations with measured environmental variables (e.g., vegetation structure and biomass and trap-site characteristics) did not indicate that treatment influenced fluctuations in species relative abundances. Consistent with past studies, forest managers of commercial pine forests using dormant-season prescribed fire with or without imazapyr will most likely have minimal additional effects on herpetofaunal assemblages, but current knowledge gaps require additional research to better understand mechanisms of species abundance and persistence in these landscapes. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","Summer herpetofaunal response to prescribed fire and herbicide in intensively managed, mid-rotation pine stands in Mississippi",0

Here, we studied the reintroduction of head-started and wild-caught juveniles of a distinctive reptile, the tuatara Sphenodon punctatus, on the South Island of New Zealand. We compared morphometric, ecophysiological, behavioural and spatial aspects for juveniles from three groups (wild-caught from a warmer climate, head-started from a warmer climate and head-started from the local climate), focusing on the first 5months of summer following release. Group did not affect body condition at recapture, but wild-caught juveniles, despite being the only animals with ticks at release, grew faster and had higher inferred body temperatures than individuals head-started in a warmer climate. Wild-caught juveniles were less frequently seen emerged than juveniles head-started at the release site, and no animals had ticks at the summer's end. Mean dispersal distance and home-range size did not differ significantly between groups, and all groups had high survival (96.4-100% over first summer; at least 66.7-73.3% after the first winter following release). We conclude that, for most metrics, post-release performance of head-started and wild-caught juvenile tuatara was similar, and that head-started groups can differ between each other as much as between captive and wild.

However, the specific mechanisms influencing dispersal within such landscapes remain poorly understood. The objective of our study was to assess how matrix type (improved pasture, native pasture or crop) and structure (grass height) influence fine-scale reptile movement, as well as influences of crop sowing direction and setting-sun position. In an agricultural region of south-eastern Australia, we first released 20 individuals of an arboreal gecko (Christinus marmoratus) at set distances from trees to determine the distance at which they could perceive their tree habitat (perceptual range). We then translocated 36 individuals into six matrix environments within their perceptual range of isolated trees to examine how gecko movement was modified by the type and structure of the matrix. We also recorded crop sowing direction and setting-sun position and examined all recorded tracks using angular statistics. We found that geckos exhibited a perceptual range of 40–80m. Short matrix environments promoted direct movements towards trees, irrespective of matrix type. Furthermore, movements were significantly affected by crop sowing direction with individuals following the planted lines. Our study has three significant implications: (i) restoring mature tree spacing to 80 m apart will assist gecko movements, (ii) targeted management for low pasture height, such as by maintaining directional narrow strips of low vegetation among taller pastures, might assist movement and facilitate increased connectivity, (iii) directional sowing of crops between habitat patches presents a simple but potentially effective tool for reconnecting fragmented landscapes.","Pasture height and crop direction influence reptile movement in an agricultural matrix",0

Yet, many of the mechanisms by which grazing leads to changes in biodiversity remain unresolved. One reason is that conventional grazing studies often target broad treatments rather than specific parameters of grazing (e.g., intensity, duration, and frequency) or fail to account for historical grazing effects. We conducted a landscape-scale replicated grazing experiment (15,000 km2, 97 sites) to examine the impact of past grazing management and current grazing regimes (intensity, duration, and frequency) on a community of ground-dwelling herpetofauna (39 species). We analyzed community variables (species richness and composition) for all species and built multiseason patch-occupancy models to predict local colonization and extinction for the 7 most abundant species. Past grazing practices did not influence community richness but did affect community composition and patch colonization and extinction for 4 of 7 species. Present grazing parameters did not influence community richness or composition, but 6 of the 7 target species were affected by at least one grazing parameter. Grazing frequency had the most consistent influence, positively affecting 3 of 7 species (increased colonization or decreased extinction). Past grazing practice affected community composition and population dynamics in some species in different ways, which suggests that conservation planners should examine the different grazing histories of an area. Species responded differently to specific current grazing practices; thus, incentive programs that apply a diversity of approaches rather than focusing on a change such as reduced grazing intensity should be considered. Based on our findings, we suggest that determining fine-scale grazing attributes is essential for advancing grazing as a conservation strategy.","Effects of past and present livestock grazing on herpetofauna in a landscape-scale experiment",0

Our poor understanding of these relationships hinders effective design and management of these habitats to conserve biodiversity. We evaluated the influence of buffer design, management, and surrounding landscape characteristics on snake occurrence in grassed waterways in southeastern Iowa. We documented snakes at nearly 80% of the grassed waterways and captured 119 individual snakes of five species; one of which, the Smooth Green Snake (Lioclonorophis vernalis), is listed as a species of conservation concern in Iowa. We used a multiple logistic regression and an information theoretic approach to determine the most parsimonious local and landscape variable models that best explained snake species occurrence. The ""local"" waterway design variable, width, occurred in the best local variable models for three of the five species and was positively associated with snake presence for all three species.

Despite much research in and application of translocation, this technique is often marred by low success rates. While many possible factors could contribute to low translocation success, outcomes are often improved when researchers engage in a soft release, which provides the animals with the opportunity for extra time to acclimate to their release site, indicating that aspects of learning may play an important role in translocation success. To test the importance of the time available for learning in translocation success, we performed hard and soft releases into an existing population of Eastern painted turtles Chrysemys picta that has experienced seasonal ephemeral water sources and in which resident turtles navigate to new permanent sources of water with extreme precision (±3.5 m) using specific routes known to be facilitated by learning. Translocated adult turtles in both hard- and soft-release groups failed to successfully negotiate upland habitat, even when given 3 months to prospect and learn (the maximum time possible in our system). Likewise, turtles in both groups moved more slowly, stopped more frequently, and were slower to restart movement than resident adults. Finally, both translocated groups exhibited significant drops in body mass and elevated rates of predation. In contrast, juveniles from the same donor population navigated to alternative water successfully, with movements and mortality rates not different from resident animals. These results indicate that complex aspects of cognition beyond time to learn can influence translocation success and highlight the importance of considering how and when animals learn.","An empirical test of the role of learning in translocation",0

There is limited information on the effects of grazing by domestic livestock on the vertebrate fauna of Australia and the establishment of a long-term grazing experiment in north-eastern Queensland at Wambiana provided an opportunity to attempt an examination of the changes in vertebrate fauna as a consequence of the manipulation of stocking rates. The aim was to identify what the relative effects of vegetation type, stocking rate and other landscape-scale environmental factors were on the patterns recorded. Sixteen 1-ha sites were established within three replicated treatments (moderate, heavy and variable stocking rates). The sites were sampled in the wet and dry seasons in 19992000 (T0) and again in 200304 (T1). All paddocks of the treatments were burnt in 1999. Average annual rainfall declined markedly between the two sampling periods, which made interpretation of the data difficult. A total of 127 species of vertebrate fauna comprising five amphibian, 83 bird, 27 reptile and 12 mammal species were recorded. There was strong separation in faunal composition from T0 to T1 although changes in mean compositional dissimilarity between the grazing stocking rate treatments were less well defined. There was a relative change in abundance of 24 bird, four mammal and five reptile species from T0 to T1. The generalised linear modelling identified that, in the T1 data, there was significant variation in the abundance of 16 species explained by the grazing and vegetation factors. This study demonstrated that vertebrate fauna assemblage did change and that these changes were attributable to the interplay between the stocking rates, the vegetation types on the sites surveyed, the burning of the experimental paddocks and the decrease in rainfall over the course of the two surveys. It is recommended that the experiment is sampled again but that the focus should be on a rapid survey of abundant taxa (i.e. birds and reptiles) to allow an increase in the frequency of sampling and replication of the data. This would help to articulate more clearly the trajectory of vertebrate change due to the relative effects of stocking rates compared with wider landscape environmental changes. Given the increasing focus on pastoral development in northern Australia, any opportunity to incorporate the collection of data on biodiversity into grazing manipulation experiments should be taken for the assessment of the effects of land management on faunal species. © Australian Rangeland Society 2012.","Spatial and temporal effects of grazing management and rainfall on the vertebrate fauna of a tropical savanna",0

Methods to mitigate turtle bycatch mortality typically involve reducing the capture of bycatch using gear modifications. Another method to reduce mortality is to keep bycatch alive following capture. Using physiological measures of anoxia, this study determined whether providing air spaces using floats within fyke nets could prevent turtles from drowning. In a controlled setting, blood lactate and pH of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) experimentally introduced into submerged nets, nets with floats, and nets that breached the surface were compared. While emulating commercial fishing practices - where turtles and fish voluntarily entered nets - catch rates and compositions as well as blood lactate in turtles captured were compared in submerged nets with and without floats. Painted turtles in submerged nets exhibited elevated blood lactate and pronounced acidosis compared with turtles from nets with floats and surfaced nets. Catch rates and compositions from emulated fishing were statistically similar in nets with and without floats; however, total fish catches were roughly one-third less in nets with floats. The same pattern of physiological disturbance was observed with turtles captured in submerged nets with and without floats as in the controlled experiment. Overall, blood physiology indicated that anoxia occurred in turtles in submerged nets while nets with floats reduced physiological disturbance. However, variation in blood lactate levels when fishing fyke nets with floats suggests that turtles were experiencing slight anoxia and so the size of air spaces may be important in allowing access to air. Creating air spaces in fyke nets using floats is a simple and cost-effective method to avoid the drowning of turtles. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","A breath of fresh air: avoiding anoxia and mortality of freshwater turtles in fyke nets by the use of floats",0

A patch-burn grazing study at Osage Prairie, MO, USA in 2011–2012 created landscape patches with treatments of grazing, fire, and such legacies. Response variables were measured before and after the application of treatments, and I used robust-design occupancy modeling to estimate patch occupancy and detection rate within patches, and recolonization and extinction (i.e., dispersal) across patches. I conducted redundancy analysis and a permuted multivariate analysis of variance to determine if patch type and the associated environmental factors explained herpetofauna assemblage. Estimates for reptiles indicate that occupancy was seasonally constant in Control patches (<U+03C8> ~ 0.5), but declined to <U+03C8> ~ 0.15 in patches following the applications of fire and grazing. Local extinctions for reptiles were higher in patches with fire or light grazing (e ~ 0.7) compared to the controls. For the riparian herpetofaunal community, patch type and grass height were important predictors of abundance; further, the turtles, lizards, snakes, and adult amphibians used different patch types. The aquatic amphibian community was predicted by watershed and in-stream characteristics, irrespective of fire or grazing. The varying responses from taxonomic groups demonstrate habitat partitioning across multiple patch types undergoing fire, cattle grazing, and legacy effects.

To minimize the risk of terrapins entering crab pots, researchers have suggested the use of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) to reduce the size of crab pot openings and thereby exclude terrapins from entering crab pots. Despite these recommendations, few studies have observed terrapin interactions with BRDs and effectively evaluated the efficacy of these devices at preventing the entry of terrapins into pots. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of BRD presence and orientation on terrapin behaviour around crab pots and overall terrapin capture rates. In a controlled laboratory setting, terrapins investigated crab pots more frequently when crab pots were baited with fish versus chicken. Terrapins were captured more frequently when BRDs were not installed. The presence of the BRDs also increased the length of time necessary for a terrapin to enter a crab pot and decreased the proportion of entries relative to the number of investigations. Vertically-oriented BRDs were more effective than horizontally-oriented BRDs at reducing terrapin captures. To prevent the continued decline of terrapin populations due to crab fisheries, it is recommended that crabbers avoid the use of fish as bait in crab pots to reduce the attractiveness of pots to terrapins and fit all crab pots with vertically-oriented BRDs to reduce terrapin entrapment.

During 2013 and 2014, we measured vegetation and monitored herpetofauna via trapping and visual encounter surveys (VES) at locations affected by biocontrol along the Virgin River in the Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States. Twenty-one sites were divided into four riparian stand types based on density and percent cover of dominant trees (Tamarix, Prosopis, Populus, and Salix) and presence or absence of restoration. Restoration activities consisted of mechanically removing non-native trees, transplanting native trees, and restoring hydrologic flows. Restored sites had three times more total lizard and eight times more yellow-backed spiny lizard (Sceloporus uniformis) captures than other stand types. Woodhouse's toad (Anaxyrus woodhousii) captures were greatest in unrestored and restored Tam-Pop/Sal sites. Results from VES indicated that herpetofauna abundance was greatest in the restored Tam-Pop/Sal site compared with the adjacent unrestored Tam-Pop/Sal site. Tam sites were characterized by having high Tamarix cover, percent canopy cover, and shade. Restored Tam-Pop/Sal sites were most similar in habitat to Tam-Pop/Sal sites. Two species of herpetofauna (spiny lizard and toad) were found to prefer habitat components characteristic of restored Tam-Pop/Sal sites. Restored sites likely supported higher abundances of these species because restoration activities reduced canopy cover, increased native tree density, and restored surface water.","The effects of riparian restoration following saltcedar (<i>Tamarix</i> spp.) biocontrol on habitat and herpetofauna along a desert stream",0

Male genetic integration for mitigative translocations have as of yet not been assessed and could greatly undermine the validity of translocation evaluations. To test for successful male integration, we determined genetic paternity of 92 desert tortoise hatchlings (Gopherus agassizii), from both resident and translocated females, four years after the initial translocation event and found that all 35 hatchlings with a paternal match in our genotype database were sired by residents. Given that translocated males constitute 46% of the genotyped males found in the home ranges of the females, they produce significantly fewer offspring than resident males in the same area (G-test, p value < 0.0001). This is the first study assessing paternal genetic integration following a translocation of a wild sourced population into a native resident population. We hypothesize that male condition following the translocation, female mate preference for prior residents and competitive exclusion by resident males may contribute to the lower reproductive output of translocated males.

Turtle interactions with gear can be defined as those that are "" observable"" based on standard fishery observer protocols, plus unobserved interactions, which include both quantifiable and unquantifiable interactions. Once a gear modification is in place, a turtle interaction that was once observable may become unobservable, because the gear modification successfully prevented the turtle from being captured. This paper describes turtle interactions in scallop dredge gear from 2001 to 2008, identifies gear and environmental correlates with observable interaction rates, and reports the average annual number of interactions and adult-equivalent interactions before and after chain mats were mandated in the fishery. Fisheries observer data were used to develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to estimate rates of observable interactions of hard-shelled turtles. These rates were applied to commercial dredge fishing effort to estimate the total number of observable interactions, and to infer the number of unobservable, yet quantifiable interactions after chain mats were implemented. Interaction rates of hard-shelled turtles were correlated with sea surface temperature, depth, and use of a chain mat. The average number of annual observable interactions of hard-shelled turtles in the Mid-Atlantic scallop dredge fishery prior to the implementation of chain mats (1 January 2001 through 25 September 2006) was estimated to be 288 turtles (CV = 0.14, 95% CI: 209-363), which is equivalent to 49 adults. After implementation of chain mats, the average annual number of observable interactions was estimated to be 20 turtles (CV = 0.48, 95% CI: 3-42), equivalent to 4 adults. If the rate of observable interactions from dredges without chain mats had been applied to trips with chain mats, the estimated number of observable and inferred interactions of hard-shelled species after chain mats were implemented would have been 125 turtles per year (CV = 0.15, 95% CI: 88-163).

One factor that can contribute to failed translocations is releasing animals into poor-quality or otherwise inadequate habitat. Here, we used a targeted approach to test the relationship of habitat features to post-translocation dispersal and survival of juvenile Mojave desert tortoises Gopherus agassizii. We selected three habitat characteristics – rodent burrows, substrate texture (prevalence and size of rocks) and washes (ephemeral river beds) – that are tied to desert tortoise ecology. At the point of release, we documented rodent burrow abundance, substrate texture and wash presence and analysed their relationship to the maximum dispersal. We also documented the relative use by each individual for each habitat characteristic and analysed their relationships with survival and fatal encounters with a predator in the first year after release. In general, the presence of refugia or other areas that enabled animals to avoid detection, such as burrows and substrate, decreased the overall mortality as well as predator-mediated mortality. The presence of washes and substrate that enhanced the tortoises’ ability to avoid detection also associated with the reduced dispersal away from the release site. These results indicate an important role for all three measured habitat characteristics in driving dispersal, survival or fatal encounters with a predator in the first year after translocation. Synthesis and applications. Resource managers using translocations as a conservation tool should prioritize acquiring data linking habitat to fitness. In particular, for species that depend on avoiding detection, refuges such as burrows and habitat that improved concealment had notable ability to improve the survival and dispersal. Our study on juvenile Mojave desert tortoises showed that refuge availability or the distributions of habitat appropriate for concealment are important considerations for identifying translocation sites for species highly dependent on crypsis, camouflage or other forms of habitat matching.","Habitat drives dispersal and survival of translocated juvenile desert tortoises",0

The first day of nesting varied by 29 d among years and was correlated with the number of heating degree days in May (i.e., colder springs were associated with later start dates). Substantial variation in body size was found among reproductive females, with a range of carapace lengths (CL) of 79 mm and a 3.8-fold difference in body mass. Larger females showed a weak but significant tendency to nest earlier than smaller females each year. Females captured on coal tailings had significantly higher body temperatures than females in the mitigated area. We estimated minimum female age at maturity at 9 y and the median age at 14 y from counts of scute annuli. Population age structure was probably much broader (and older) than that indicated by our age estimates, however, because more than a quarter of all adult females appeared to be too old to accurately age. Clutch size averaged 10.3 eggs and increased with female body size. Larger and heavier females also produced larger and heavier hatchlings.

Cohort sexes ranged from 97% females (<U+2640>:<U+2642> ratio of 6.25:1) in 2008 to 84% males (<U+2640>:<U+2642> ratio of 0.19:1) in 2009, apparently primarily in response to local weather conditions during the temperature-sensitive phase of incubation.

Efforts to cool (artificially shade) some nesting burrows were unsuccessful in increasing the proportion of male hatchlings in 2009. Cohort sex ratios were associated with average daily air temperatures during incubation, such that more females were produced during warmer periods, in good agreement with published temperaturecontrolled laboratory experiments. These results suggest that weather played a major role in determining sex ratios, with apparently smaller or negligible influences resulting from initial location, structure and operation of the head-start facility; experimental shading of nests; and individual mothers' variation in the timing of egg laying and placement of nests within the natal burrows.

We studied the prey availability in relation to the diet of two common and abundant, but understudied small vertebrates: Gehyra dubia, an arboreal nocturnal gecko, and Cryptoblepharus australis, an arboreal diurnal skink. We sampled lizards in two major woodland habitat types, Reid River box (Eucalyptus brownii) and Silver-leaf ironbark (Eucalyptus melanophloia) and among four cattle grazing regimes (ranging from moderate – heavy stocking). Cryptoblepharus australis were more abundant in the Silver-leaf ironbark habitat, but there was no effect of grazing regime on their abundance. In contrast, G. dubia did not differ significantly in abundance in relation to habitat type, but were more abundant in paddocks with heavier stocking rates. We quantified invertebrate prey available to lizards in these habitats using defined-area searches and light trapping. Invertebrate community composition did not differ significantly between the habitat types or among the four grazing regimes. Although G. dubia and C. australis both occupied the same microhabitats, they were temporally segregated based on their activity times. While both species are apparently habitat generalists, we found that G. dubia and C. australis are selective in their diets. Only half of the invertebrate groups available in the environment occurred in the diets of either lizard species. Both species positively selected Coleoptera (beetles), Araneae (spiders), and Scorpiones (scorpions), and they exhibited high dietary niche overlap (O = 0.97).

Trials assessing circle hooks of different sizes and shapes, and different baits, have been conducted to determine the effectiveness in the reduction of sea turtle bycatch and changes in hooking location. In this paper, information from 1823 olive ridley sea turtles incidentally captured in the EPO were analyzed to assess how hook type (J, tuna hooks or circle hooks), hook size, bait type (squid or fish), turtle size and target species (tunas, sharks or mahi-mahi) affect hooking location on sea turtles. This were modeled with a Classification and Regression Tree using hooking location as a multinomial variable response (for 6 categories of hooking locations); and also as a binomial response (swallowed vs. non-swallowed) using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). Hook type and size, plus bait type, were the most important factors affecting hooking location, while turtle size and target species did not have any significant effect. J-hooks and tuna hooks had a much greater probability of being swallowed than circle hooks. In addition, as the hook size increased, the likelihood of swallowing it decreased. The use of fish bait in combination with larger circle hooks tended to produce higher proportions of external hookings. An increase in external or lower mandible hookings is preferred since these locations are assumed to be less dangerous for the animal's post-release survival, and because hooks and attached gear are easier to remove by well-trained fishermen.","Hooking locations in sea turtles incidentally captured by artisanal longline fisheries in the eastern Pacific Ocean",0

In the marine turtles, sex is determined by incubation temperature, such that warming temperatures could lead to a higher production of female hatchlings. By measuring nest temperature, and using a model to relate the incubation temperature to sex ratio, we estimate that Caribbean Colombian leatherback sea turtles currently produce approximately 92% female hatchlings. We modelled the relationship between incubation, sand and air temperature, and under all future climate change scenarios (0.4-6.0 °C warming over the next 100 years), complete feminization could occur, as soon as the next decade. However, male producing refugia exist in the periphery of smaller nests (0.7 °C cooler at the bottom than at the centre), within beaches (0.3 °C cooler in the vegetation line and inter-tidal zone) and between beaches (0.4 °C higher on dark beaches), and these natural refugia could be assigned preferential conservation status. However, there exists a need to develop strategies that may ameliorate deleterious effects of climate-induced temperature changes in the future. We experimentally shaded clutches using screening material, and found that it was effective in reducing nest temperature, producing a higher proportion of male hatchlings, without compromising the fitness or hatching success.

Individuals from the resident population (N = 20) and from a distant control population (N = 11) were also radio-tracked. More than 11,000 fixes were collected, enabling us to precisely describe movement patterns. Most translocated tortoises first dispersed (> 500 m to > 3000 m away) in a random direction and sometimes crossed unfavorable areas. Later, a marked shift in movement pattern, from a relatively unidirectional course to multidirectional displacements indicated settlement. Movement patterns of translocated and resident individuals became undistinguishable after settlement. Most individuals settled during the first year after release but several settled in the second year. Mean annual survival rate (> 85%) remained within the range of the species but was lower compared to the resident (93%) and control tortoises (100%). Overall, most translocated individuals (~ 63%) settled and adapted well to their novel environment. This result is essential regarding current controversies that are unfounded and that limit conservation translocations.

At 12 sites, we surveyed reptiles and environmental covariates in remnant woodland patches and in four paddock types: (i) grazed pasture, (ii) linear plantings, (iii) coarse woody debris (CWD) added to grazed pasture and (iv) fences between grazed pasture. Each site was either continuously or rotationally grazed. Remnant vegetation and other vegetation attributes such as tree cover and leaf litter greatly influenced reptiles. We recorded higher reptile abundance and species richness in areas with more tree cover and leaf litter. For rare species (captured in =4 sites <70 captures), there were 5·7 more animals and 2·6 more species in sites with 50% woody cover within 3 km compared to 5% woody cover. The abundance and richness of rare species, and one common species differed between paddock types and were higher in linear plantings and fence transects compared to CWD and pasture transects. Synthesis and applications. Grazed paddocks, particularly those with key features such as fences and plantings can provide habitat for reptiles. This suggests that discrete differentiation between patch and matrix does not apply for reptiles in these systems. Management to promote reptile conservation in agricultural landscapes should involve protecting existing remnant vegetation, regardless of amount; and promote key habitat features of trees, leaf litter and shrubs.

First, we used radio-telemetry to determine the frequency of railway crossings and compared this to correlated random walk (CRW) simulations to assess if tortoises were crossing the rails less frequently than is expected by unconstrained movement. Second, we placed tortoises into the railway and measured behavior for one hour to assess crossing ability. Lastly, we tested whether trenches dug underneath the rails could allow safe passage for tortoises. We found that railways impacted the movement of Gopher Tortoises. Gopher Tortoises crossed the railway less often than what would be expected by unhindered movement for five of our ten tortoises tracked. During behavioral trials, 0 of 24 tortoises placed within the railways were capable of escaping from the rails. Using game cameras, we detected tortoises using trenches dug underneath the rails and between the ties 68 times over the course of a single summer.

Here we present the results of an artificial incubation programme started in 2007 to protect the clutches from human predation. A preliminary survey in 2006 showed that about 60% of clutches laid were taken by humans. Over the study period (2007-2010) we recorded 400 clutches, of which 38.2% were predated by humans, 40.7% were artificially incubated and 21% were incubated in situ. Overall, the artificial incubation programme allowed the release of 12,340 hatchlings. No differences were found in hatching and emergence success between clutches incubated in situ and clutches artificially incubated. However, incubation temperatures and incubation durations recorded suggest a male-biased hatchling sex-ratio in artificially incubated clutches. Although artificial incubation may mitigate the effect of egg take, our results indicate that other measures, such as clutch relocation to protected sections of the beach should be taken. Beach patrolling and education are currently implemented so that artificial incubation will be eventually phased out in favour of in situ incubation.

This nesting aggregation is threatened by widespread illegal egg take, and clutch relocation and artificial incubation have been carried out as protection measures since 1974. We assess the efficacy of such efforts and investigate how artificial incubation may be influencing the success and sex ratios of clutches. We compare hatching success, incubation duration and embryo mortality in in-situ clutches (nÂ =Â 43) with those incubated artificially at sites in the east and west of the Park (nÂ =Â 35 and nÂ =Â 31, respectively). Our results show that in the west, artificial incubation significantly decreases hatching success in clutches. In the east the duration of incubation is increased, which we predict would result in an increase in the number of males from these clutches. Clutch relocation is currently the only viable conservation option for clutches on eastern beaches because of illegal egg take but action is needed to ensure that the natural sex ratio is not distorted. However, on the western beaches in situ clutch incubation seems possible through beach protection. Further community engagement and enforcement are required to improve conservation measures at eastern beaches if long-term, less sustainable intervention is to be avoided.","Assessing the efficacy of direct conservation interventions: clutch protection of the leatherback marine turtle in the Dominican Republic",0

Contrary to expectations, sex ratios, injury incidence, and frequency of juvenile size classes did not differ between turtles in the suburbs and the nature reserve. Moreover, turtles in the suburbs were nearly 3 times more abundant, grew 5 times faster, and had populations comprised of more adults in the larger size classes than nature reserve populations. These findings, together with net movements from the nature reserves into the suburbs, suggest that suburban water bodies were the higher quality habitat, effectively buffering turtles from temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions during drought.

The present paper reports marine turtle bycatch composition and rates from a Portuguese commercial longline fishery targeting swordfish in the South Atlantic, and investigates the effects of changes in hook style and bait type. In total, 310 longline sets were carried out between 2008 and 2012. Three different hook styles were tested, traditional J hook (9/0) and two 17/0 circle hooks (a non-offset and a 10o offset), but only one bait type was used in each set (Scomber spp. or Illex spp.). Two species of sea turtles were caught, the leatherback Dermochelys coriacea, and the loggerhead Caretta caretta, the latter comprising the majority of the catches. The highest mean bycatch per unit of effort values for both species combined (1.693/1000 hooks) and for the individual species (1.505/1000 hooks for loggerheads) occurred with J-style hooks baited with squid. Changing from J-style to one of the circle hooks was only significant when using squid bait (with the odds-ratios decreasing between 54% and 63%). Hooking location was species-specific, with most loggerheads hooked by the mouth, while leatherbacks were mostly hooked externally by the flippers. Overall, 65% of all sea turtles were released alive (85% for leatherbacks compared with 63% for loggerheads). Significant reduction of sea turtle accidental catches on the swordfish longline fisheries can be achieved by changing the J hooks to circle hooks, especially if baited with mackerel.

Coarse woody debris (CWD) is a critical resource for a whole suite of animal taxa but remains an underappreciated component of some forest ecosystems and restoration activities. The extent to which recovery of animal communities can be accelerated through artificial supplementation of woody debris is poorly understood especially for highly diverse tropical forest systems. Here, we report early results from an experiment designed to manipulate CWD in young restoration plantings (0-7 year old) in tropical north-east Australia for the purposes of facilitating re-establishment of rainforest reptiles. After 1 year, we demonstrate that CWD addition within restoration plantings adjacent to remnant forest can increase the local abundance of reptiles and promote colonisation of the log-specialist Prickly Skink (Gnypetoscincus queenslandiae). These preliminary results, however, are based on observations of just 44 individual reptiles encompassing seven species. Ongoing monitoring will elucidate longer-term outcomes to enable a proper evaluation of when and where CWD addition might be most beneficial in realising restoration goals. © 2014 Ecological Society of Australia.","Putting it back: woody debris in young restoration plantings to stimulate return of reptiles",0

The success of these programs depends on increasing population numbers while maintaining fitness within populations that contain some captive-reared individuals. As part of an ongoing conservation project with Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) in Saginaw, Michigan, USA, the Detroit Zoological Society (DZS) headstarted Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) to 18 months of age. To determine survival, movements, and habitat use of these headstarted Blanding's turtles, we externally attached radio-transmitters to 24 turtles and released them at 4 sites in release groups of 6 along a transect in a wetland within SNWR during June 2014. We located turtles weekly during the active season (May–Sep) and every 2 weeks during the inactive season (Oct–Apr) for 18 months, starting immediately after release and ending November 2015. We calculated straight-line distances between release sites and home range centers over the study period. We examined habitat use of the turtles in relation to habitat availability. To predict movement of headstarted Blanding's turtles away from release sites, we used geographically weighted regression (GWR) with measured habitat factors and release sites as independent variables. There were differences in home range sizes across release groups but not between years. Headstarted juvenile Blanding's turtles in this study have home range sizes similar to those measured in other studies for wild-hatched juveniles but smaller home ranges than those measured for wild-hatched adults. Our study showed that headstarted Blanding's turtles used habitats with muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) dens and cattails (Typha spp.) more than proportionally available, and used open water, willows (Salix spp.), and lowland forest less than proportionally available. The GWR model was able to predict habitat characteristics (water depth and temperature, duckweed [Lemna minor], cattails, muskrat dens and fields, buttonbush [Cephalanthus occidentalis]) that influenced the movement of turtles away from the release sites. The habitat coefficient's influence on movement varied in relation to the current location of the turtle and as habitat characteristics increased or decreased. Turtle distance from release sites decreased as water depth, water temperature, and duckweed increased, and increased as cattails, muskrat dens and fields, and buttonbush increased. Habitat in the small spatial extent at release sites may affect movement of headstarted Blanding's turtles. Furthermore, this study uses novel methodologies for assessing headstart programs that can aid future conservation and management efforts by providing information on habitat use and movement patterns of headstarted Blanding's turtles after release. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.","Movement and habitat use of headstarted Blanding's turtles in Michigan",1

Then, we examined reptile assemblages after all sites experienced more than a decade of prescribed burning at two- to thee-year return intervals. Data were collected concurrently at reference sites chosen to represent target conditions for restoration. Reptile assemblages changed most rapidly in response to prescribed burning, but reptile assemblages at all sites, including reference sites, were generally indistinguishable by the end of the study.

There was a significant increase in the abundance of reptiles over a two year period in cat-excluded plots with reptile abundance increasing at twice the rate in cat-exclusion plots compared with cat-accessible plots and there was an additive effect of time-since-fire. Cat exclusion had a positive effect on reptile species richness over time, however the evidence for this pattern was weak when seasonal variation was taken into account.

Methods to reduce turtle bycatch and mortality must strike a balance between bycatch reduction and target species retention if they are to gain acceptance from fishers. To investigate potential bycatch reduction measures, we examined the effects of hook size, bait type, baiting technique, and animal size on the frequency of loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta ingesting a baited hook during controlled trials. Results indicated that as hook size increased, the likelihood for deep ingestion decreased. Smaller turtles were less likely to swallow larger hooks. Turtles were less likely to swallow hooks baited with sardines than with squid and single-baited rather than threaded baits. Results are likely due to differences in bait texture, hook shielding effects, and turtles' behavioral differences. We suggest that fishing with large hooks, using finfish instead of squid, and using single-baited instead of threaded baits might reduce deep ingestion rates of hooks by loggerheads as large as 65 cm in standard straight carapace length (notch to tip). © Inter-Research 2011.","Hook ingestion rates in loggerhead sea turtles <i>Caretta caretta</i> as a function of animal size, hook size, and bait",0

Although many studies of factors influencing faunal recolonization have examined the influence of in situ site factors, fewer have examined the influence of neighborhood landscape factors, especially in landscapes with permeable matrices. To assess the relative influence of landscape and site factors on reptile recolonization in a production landscape with a permeable matrix, we surveyed reptiles at intact reference sites and post-mining restoration sites (3–20 years post-mining [YPM]) in a forest ecosystem in southwestern Australia. Reptile assemblages in restoration sites never converged on those in reference habitat. Reptile species composition and individual species abundances (>20 detections) in restoration sites were primarily influenced by site factors such as canopy height, litter cover, and coarse woody debris volume, and not by landscape factors. We suggest that the most common reptile species in our study area are primarily influenced by site factors, not landscape factors, and most reptiles detected in restoration sites were present by 3–4 YPM. Therefore, it is likely that habitat suitability is the main barrier to most species' recolonization of restoration sites in landscapes with permeable matrices.

We estimated home ranges with Fixed Kernel estimator (FK) and Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) after checking tortoise site fidelity. We observed that home range size did not differ significantly between males and females (mean FK = 2.01 ha, mean MCP = 3.01 ha). Secondly, we studied macrohabitat selection using a vegetation map. Preferred habitats were open shrubland, open forest and barren land during the activity period, and dense forest, dense shrubland and open shrubland during the hibernation. Next, we assessed microhabitat selection along five periods of the annual cycle: hibernation, emergence from hibernation, spring, summer and autumn. We then located marked tortoises weekly and classified the plant species observed in each location. Principal component analyses showed that tortoises selected shrubs with trees during hibernation, bramble during summer and herbaceous habitat during the breeding season.

Lizard sprint performance was compared among three habitats with different fire histories: a control habitat, which had not experienced fire in more than 60 years, a recovering habitat that had not experienced fire in 4 years, and a recent burn habitat that burned less than 6 months prior to the study. There were significant differences in locomotor performance among lizards from the different habitats (indicative of phenotypic plasticity), and lizards in the recent burn habitat had significantly higher maximum sprint speeds than lizards in recovering and control habitats. To measure the consistency of locomotor performance within individuals, lizards were captured and raced during the field seasons of 2014 and again in 2015. Locomotor performance was significantly repeatable across years, suggesting lizard populations contain considerable individual variation, despite this trait being closely tied to fitness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to observe individual between-year repeatability in performance of free-ranging S. undulatus.

In previous studies eggs have been incubated in hypoxia using heavy and expensive Perspex chambers. We tested whether extending pre-ovipositional embryonic arrest through hypoxic incubation protects embryos from movement-induced mortality and we investigated more practical and cost-effective methods for transporting eggs under hypoxic conditions. Olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) eggs were randomly divided among four different treatments after oviposition; a control (normoxic) treatment, Perspex containers or ziplock bags filled with nitrogen gas, or vacuum-sealed bags. Eggs remained in their respective treatment for three days before being removed from their container or bag and placed into artificial incubators. Some eggs from each treatment were inverted when removed from their respective treatment in order to test their susceptibility to movement-induced mortality. We found a reduction in hatching success in the hypoxic treatments (20–43%) compared with the control (68%). However, all methods of hypoxic incubation delayed development and protected against movement-induced mortality. We conclude that plastic bags filled with nitrogen or vacuum bags can be used for maintenance of hypoxia in turtle eggs, thus providing a simple and cost-effective method for transportation of eggs for conservation and research purposes.","Hypoxia as a novel method for preventing movement-induced mortality during translocation of turtle eggs",0

Current management strategies for ex situ populations are based on theoretical models, which have mainly been tested in model species or assessed using studbook data. During recent years an increasing number of molecular genetic studies have been published on captive populations of several endangered species. However, a comprehensive analysis of these studies is still outstanding. Here, we present a review of the published literature on ex situ conservation genetics with a focus on molecular studies. We analysed 188 publications which either presented empirical studies using molecular markers (105), studbook analyses (26), theoretical work (38), or tested the genetic effects of management strategies using model species (19). The results show that inbreeding can be minimized by a thorough management of captive populations. There seems to be a minimum number of founders (15) and a minimum size of a captive population (100) necessary in order to minimize a loss of genetic diversity. Optimally, the founders should be unrelated and new founders should be integrated into the captive population successively. We recommend that genetic analyses should generally precede and accompany ex situ conservation projects in order to avoid inbreeding and outbreeding depression. Furthermore, many of the published studies do not provide all the relevant parameters (founder size, captive population size, Ho, He, inbreeding coefficients). We, therefore, propose that a general standard for the presentation of genetic studies should be established, which would allow integration of the data into a global database. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Ex situ conservation genetics: a review of molecular studies on the genetic consequences of captive breeding programmes for endangered animal species",0

Grassland restoration is often assumed to provide improved wildlife habitat, ostensibly increasing the abundance and diversity of at least some native wildlife species relative to unrestored, invaded annual grasslands. We compared rodent, snake and raptor activity and species richness at paired unrestored and restored grasslands across four blocked locations in the Central Valley using trapping and observational surveys in up to four seasons per guild from 2014 to 2015. Restored treatments were planted with native perennial grasses 13–24 years prior to study initiation but were partially re-invaded by Mediterranean annual grasses and forbs. Unrestored treatments contained similar non-native plant species assemblages as restored treatments, but did not contain any native grass. Rodent, snake and raptor activity was generally higher in unrestored relative to restored treatments. For rodents, the non-native Mus musculus (house mouse) showed the greatest disparity in abundance, while greater raptors and snakes likely responded to greater rodent abundance. Within treatments, species-specific rodent responses were related to structure of physical vegetation. In particular, Peromyscus maniculatus (native deer mouse) was associated with more bare ground and shorter vegetation, while the house mouse was associated with less bare ground and taller vegetation, regardless of treatment type. Substantial changes in rodent species composition were observed over short periods of time (<3 months) after unplanned manipulation of vegetation structure via livestock grazing, with patterns reflecting the species-specific response to physical vegetation structure. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that while grassland restoration may promote persistence of native plant communities, restoration may not be beneficial to some higher trophic levels, and in fact may reduce habitat value for some native predators in grasslands invaded by Mediterranean plant species. Changes in vegetation structure can strongly impact wildlife species composition, suggesting a more nuanced approach is required for the restoration of desired wildlife communities. Thus, species-specific goals should be carefully considered to ensure improved alignment of restoration methods with expected restoration outcomes.","Rodent, snake and raptor use of restored native perennial grasslands is lower than use of unrestored exotic annual grasslands",0

Translocated snakes experience modified behaviours, spatial use and survivorship, and few studies have investigated the impacts of translocation within a metropolitan area. Aims In the present study, we investigated the impacts of translocation on the most commonly encountered snake in Perth Western Australia, the dugite (Pseudonaja affinis, Elapidae), by comparing the space use of resident and translocated snakes. Methods We captured 10 dugites and attached telemetry packages, composed of a radio-telemetry transmitter and global positioning system (GPS) data-logger, externally to their tails. Snakes were either released within 200 m of their initial capture sites (residents, n = 6) or moved to new unconnected habitat at least 3 km away (translocated, n = 4). Spatial-use data were analysed using general linear models to identify differences between resident and translocated dugites. Key results Translocation influenced space use of dugites and detrimentally affected their survivorship. Translocated snakes had larger activity ranges than did residents, and there was a trend towards travelling greater distances over time. Mortality for all snakes was high: 100% for translocated snakes, and 50% for residents. Conclusions Urban dugites face many threats, and snakes were negatively affected by translocation. The GPS technology we used did not improve the quality of the data over traditional radio-telemetry methods, owing to the cryptic nature of the snakes that spent much of their time under cover or underground. Implications These findings support the growing body of evidence that translocating 'problem' snakes is a not a humane method of animal management, and alternatives such as public education, may be more appropriate.","Impacts of translocation on a large urban-adapted venomous snake",0

Because of this relationship between nest temperature and hatchling outcomes, global warming presents an immediate threat to many sea turtle nesting beaches throughout the world. Even small rises in nest temperatures may skew sex ratios and, raise egg mortality and influence hatchling phenotypes adversely, impacting on hatchling recruitment and ultimately species survival at some rookeries. The development of adaptive management practices capable of minimizing the effects of increasing global temperature on nest temperatures is thus a priority for animals exhibiting temperature-dependent sex-determination, such as sea turtles. Here, the relationship between solar radiation exposure and nest temperatures at the Mon Repos turtle rookery, south east Queensland, Australia was explored and the relationship between nest temperature and hatchling attributes examined. Shading decreased nest temperature, and higher nest temperatures were associated with smaller sized hatchlings that had decreased locomotion performance. The use of shading to minimize nest temperature is a management strategy that may be used to mitigate detrimental effects of increased global temperatures at some rookeries. Here, we explored the viability of natural shading options, such as the planting of trees behind nesting beaches, for combating the adverse effect of increased nest temperature caused by increased air temperatures.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Sun exposure, nest temperature and loggerhead turtle hatchlings: implications for beach shading management strategies at sea turtle rookeries",0

Desertification is a major threat to degraded steppe habitats, prompting re-vegetation efforts to slow wind erosion. These processes alter both the structure and composition of the vegetation, and thus could influence predator and prey abundances, and their interactions. We investigated how habitat structure (degraded [sparse], natural [intermediate], or re-vegetated [dense]) influences lizard species richness, abundance, and diversity, and the interactions between these predators and invertebrate prey in the arid desert steppe. Structurally sparse and dense vegetation supported higher lizard abundances than natural habitats, with Phrynocephalus frontalis and Eremias argus dominating sparse and dense habitats respectively, and P. frontalis and E. multiocellata co-dominating natural habitats. Habitats that were structurally dense also supported the most complex trophic interactions among predators and prey, whereas structurally sparse habitats had low interaction diversity and interaction evenness, with most energy flowing along few trophic pathways. Steppe degradation therefore simplifies community trophic interactions, and restoration through enhanced protection of natural steppe habitat structure may play an important role in the conservation of healthy predator-prey communities. Desertification is a pressing issue throughout most of the arid steppe; revegetation efforts resulted in robust communities, in addition to promoting persistence of E. argus, which is endemic and threatened. Maintaining a heterogenous structural landscape thus may be the most promising way to combat desertification while at the same time restoring predator-prey community composition.","Effects of habitat alteration on lizard community and food web structure in a desert steppe ecosystem",0

Therefore we evaluated the effectiveness of three patterned designs (simple descriptions being rainbow, red and yellow) of the anti-predation collar cover, the Birdsbesafe® (BBS), in reducing prey captures by 114 pet cats over 2 years in a suburban Australian context. The BBS offers a colourful indicator of a cat's presence and should therefore alert prey with good colour vision (birds and herpetofauna), but not most mammals with limited colour vision. We also interviewed the 82 owners of cats in the study about their experience using the BBS and their assessment of the behavioural responses of their cats. In the first year of the study, which focused on the effectiveness of different BBS colours, captures of prey with good colour vision were reduced by 54% (95% CL 43-64%) when cats were wearing a BBS of any colour, with the rainbow and red BBS more effective than the yellow when birds were prey. Captures of mammals were not reduced significantly. The second year assessed the rainbow BBS alone, and those data combined with rainbow data in the first year found a significant reduction of 47% (95% CL 43-57%) in capture of prey with good colour vision, with no effect of differences across years. We found no evidence that cats maintained a lower predation rate once the BBS was removed. Seventy-nine per cent of owners reported that their cats had no problems with the BBS and another 17% reported that their cats adjusted within 2 days. Fourteen owners reported that their cats spent more time at home and ate more while wearing the BBS. Two owners reported their cats stayed away from home more while wearing it. Sixty-four per cent of owners using the red collar, 48% using rainbow and 46% using yellow believed that it worked. Overall, 77% of owners planned to continue using the BBS after the study had finished. The BBS is an option for owners wishing to reduce captures of birds and herpetofauna by free-ranging cats, especially where mammalian prey are introduced pests.

However, understanding the relationship between fire induced habitat disturbance and biodiversity remain equivocal. Ecological theories including the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) and the habitat accommodation model (HAM) offer predictive frameworks that could explain faunal responses to fire disturbances. We used an 80 year post-fire chronosequence to investigate small reptile community responses to fires in temperate forests across 74 sites. First, we evaluated if changes in species richness, abundance and evenness post-fire followed trends of prior predictions, including the IDH. Second, using competing models of fine scale habitat elements we evaluated the specific ways which fire influenced small reptiles. Third, we evaluated support for the HAM by examining compositional changes of reptile community post-fire. Relative abundance was positively correlated to age post-fire while richness and evenness showed no associations. The abundance trend was as expected based on the prior prediction of sustained population increase post-disturbance, but the trend for richness contradicted the prediction of highest diversity at intermediate levels of disturbance (according to IDH). Abundance changes were driven mainly by changes in overstorey, ground layer, and shelter, while richness and evenness did not associate with any vegetation parameter. Community composition was not strongly correlated to age since fire, thus support for the HAM was weak. Overall, in this ecosystem, frequent fire disturbances can be detrimental to small reptiles.

Mitigating for the ecological consequences of large herbivore losses through the use of ecological replacements to fill extinct species' niches and thereby replicate missing ecological functions has been proposed. It is unknown how different morphologically and ecologically a replacement can be from the extinct species and still provide similar functions. We studied niche equivalency between 2 phenotypes of Galápagos giant tortoises (domed and saddlebacked) that were translocated to Pinta Island in the Galápagos Archipelago as ecological replacements for the extinct saddlebacked giant tortoise (Chelonoidis abingdonii). Thirty-nine adult, nonreproductive tortoises were introduced to Pinta Island in May 2010, and we observed tortoise resource use in relation to phenotype during the first year following release. Domed tortoises settled in higher, moister elevations than saddlebacked tortoises, which favored lower elevation arid zones. The areas where the tortoises settled are consistent with the ecological conditions each phenotype occupies in its native range. Saddlebacked tortoises selected areas with high densities of the arboreal prickly pear cactus (Opuntia galapageia) and mostly foraged on the cactus, which likely relied on the extinct saddlebacked Pinta tortoise for seed dispersal. In contrast, domed tortoises did not select areas with cactus and therefore would not provide the same seed-dispersal functions for the cactus as the introduced or the original, now extinct, saddlebacked tortoises. Interchangeability of extant megaherbivores as replacements for extinct forms therefore should be scrutinized given the lack of equivalency we observed in closely related forms of giant tortoises.

Such restoration has occurred around the world, even though the relative importance of strips and patches of vegetation remains controversial. Using reptile communities from south-eastern Australia, we assessed the conservation value of revegetation in strips and alongside remnant patches compared with remnant vegetation and cleared roadsides. We also examined the distance that reptiles occurred from remnant patches into linear vegetation. We found that reptile species richness and counts did not substantially differ between revegetated, remnant and cleared habitats, or between linear strip and patch treatments. This may indicate that species sensitive to land clearing have already been lost from the landscape. These results imply that if specialist species have already been lost, we may be unable to measure the effects of agriculture on biodiversity. Furthermore, revegetation with the expectation that fauna will recolonize may be unrealistic and translocations may be necessary. Unexpectedly, we recorded higher species richness and counts of rare reptile species in remnant linear strips as distance from remnant patches increased. Ground-layer attributes were important for increasing reptile species richness and counts and in structuring reptile communities, explaining approximately three times as much variation as remnant shape or vegetation type (remnant, revegetated, cleared). Management agencies should protect and effectively manage remnant linear strips if rarer reptiles are to be retained, paying particular attention to ground-layer attributes. The decision to include ground layers in future revegetation activities will be more important than the shape of restored areas.","Reptiles in restored agricultural landscapes: the value of linear strips, patches and habitat condition",0

Agri-environment schemes (AES) attempt to integrate biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes but are often compromised by a lack of baseline data, monitoring and evaluation. Few studies have examined the benefits of AES in protecting biodiversity relative to the wider farming landscape, and no studies have explicitly quantified the effectiveness of AES to increase herpetofaunal diversity. To examine whether AES protect and increase herpetofauna, we established a landscape-wide biodiversity monitoring programme in threatened semi-arid and temperate woodland communities in south-eastern Australia. With 31 species recorded, regional herpetofaunal diversity was relatively high, whereas local diversity was low. Herpetofaunal richness and reptile assemblage structure did not differ significantly between sites under AES and sites managed for livestock production. A gradient in species richness as a function of time-since-management intervention was not evident, although the abundance of one lizard species increased under vegetation management. Reptile richness and frog abundance differed significantly among vegetation types. Herpetofaunal richness was positively related to native plant richness and bare ground cover, whereas Boulenger's skink Morethia boulengeri was negatively affected by bare ground cover. The ragged snake-eyed skink Cryptoblepharus pannosus was positively related to the amount of woody debris. Synthesis and applications. In this system, strong habitat specificity implies local-scale management interventions under agri-environment schemes (AES) may not significantly increase herpetofaunal diversity in the short term. Vegetation management is likely to increase the abundance of common lizard species rather than increase local species richness due to barrier effects. Future incentive schemes should focus on improving habitat connectivity, enhancing pasture condition and increasing woody debris in the agricultural matrix to dissolve dispersal barriers and mitigate the legacy of historical land-use practices. We propose that AES, which manage mosaics of intergrading vegetation types at multiple spatial scales, will protect maximum herpetofaunal diversity.

Overall, Blanding's Turtles significantly avoided crossing roads. Roads were a significant barrier to movement for 3-6 of the 52 turtles, and an individual's tendency to cross roads was not influenced by its sex or by the road surface (unpaved or paved).

Additionally, we translocated tortoises to study the feasibility of roadsides to function as movement corridors. We found that roadsides are not used as a movement pathway but rather as an apparent long-term residential habitat. Only one tortoise was observed exiting the roadside corridor, and minimum convex polygon (MCP) home range sizes and distances traveled remain similar to those exhibited by tortoises in larger habitat patches. Following translocation, we observed a failure to return home, either by direct paths or by corridor use, for all but one tortoise. Instead, most tortoises remained along roadsides after only a brief period of exploration. Overall, we find that roadsides act as independent, residential habitat instead of as a movement corridor. Future studies should focus on understanding the actual suitability of roadsides, as they may function as ecological traps given their attractiveness but high risk of mortality.

Populations of big-headed turtle (Platysternon megacephalum) have declined substantially across its distribution, particularly in China, because of overcollection. To understand the effects of chronic harvesting pressure on big-headed turtle populations, we examined the effects of illegal harvesting on the demography of populations in Hong Kong, where some populations still exist. We used mark-recapture methods to compare demographic characteristics between sites with harvesting histories and one site in a fully protected area. Sites with a history of illegal turtle harvesting were characterized by the absence of large adults and skewed ratios of juveniles to adults, which may have negative implications for the long-term viability of populations. These sites also had lower densities of adults and smaller adult body sizes than the protected site. Given that populations throughout most of the species' range are heavily harvested and individuals are increasingly difficult to find in mainland China, the illegal collection of turtles from populations in Hong Kong may increase over time. Long-term monitoring of populations is essential to track effects of illegal collection, and increased patrolling is needed to help control illegal harvesting of populations, particularly in national parks.

In addition, the effect of artificial lighting on the sea-finding ability of green turtles was investigated to highlight the importance of hatchling release locations on hatchery beaches. Hatchling running speed, an indicator of vigour and predation exposure, progressively decreased when hatchlings were retained in the hatchery for 1, 3 and 6 hours following emergence. Similarly, body condition (mass:straight carapace length), an indicator of dehydration and/or energy consumption, decreased after being retained for 3 and 6 hours. It was estimated that hatchlings retained for 6 hours after emergence would become significantly dehydrated and double their exposure to beach slope predation. Residual hatchlings that were immediately excavated from emerged nests had similar running speed and body condition to naturally emerged siblings. However, residual hatchlings removed from nests 5 days later had significantly reduced running speed and body condition, resulting in estimates of double the exposure to predation in near-shore areas. The mean angle of hatchling dispersal varied at different sites along the Ma'Daerah beach in relation to proximity to artificial lighting. Important recommendations for post-hatching management of sea turtle hatcheries worldwide can be made from the results of this study.

In this study, we compared reptile communities in large conservation parks with those in small woodland remnants 6.5-12km from the parks, on the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia, Australia. We assessed the impact of fragmentation on the abundance, richness and habitat preferences of reptiles, and examined whether connection to linear roadside vegetation altered reptile communities in small woodland remnants. Of the 31 reptile species, 12 were restricted to conservation parks and six to habitat fragments in farmland. There was a substantial reduction in reptile species richness and abundance in farmland fragments. Direct connection of remnant vegetation to roadside corridors did not affect abundance of common species in the farmland fragments, although species richness was lower in isolated remnants in one of our two study regions. The habitat preference of the scincid lizard Menetia greyii differed between farmland fragments, where they were regularly found on dunes and roadsides, and conservation parks, where they were rare and not detected on dunes. We suggest that habitat fragmentation may have altered interspecific interactions, enabling an expansion of habitat use in the farming landscape. Significantly lower abundance of four common species in farmland settings compared with reserves indicated that existing corridors and small fragments provide inadequate connectivity over larger distances.

Many North American estuaries are adversely affected by anthropogenic impacts, such as pollution, dredging and invasion by non-native plants. Many nesting areas have been altered or destroyed, causing terrapins to nest on roadsides and artificial islands made of dredged substrate from bottom sediments. Shading by non-native plants may suppress development and reduce survival of embryos. In Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, USA, there is a mosaic of natural and degraded terrapin nesting habitats. We investigated the effects of dredge soil and shade on the hatching success of diamondback terrapins to determine whether nesting habitat could be increased by using dredged bottom sediments. In year 1, unshaded nests in natural loamy-sand had the highest hatching success (55.2%), while nests in dredge soil produced no hatchlings. In year 2, nests in unshaded loamy-sand had a hatching success of 85.3%, whereas those in dredge soil, aged 1 year, had a hatching success of 59.4%. Dredge soil improved as an incubation substrate after aging 1 year by the washout of salt. Nest temperatures were generally cool and produced mostly male hatchlings. Uncontaminated dredge soil may provide suitable nesting substrates for diamondback terrapins if used after one year, and may be particularly beneficial if used for constructing islands that provide new nesting sites with reduced access of mammalian predators. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Artificial nesting habitats as a conservation strategy for turtle populations experiencing global change",0

Blood samples were collected from adult tortoises in three treatment groups (resident, translocated and control) for 1 year prior to and 2 years after translocation. Samples were analyzed by radioimmunoassay for plasma total corticosterone (CORT), a glucocorticoid hormone commonly associated with stress responses in reptiles. CORT values were analyzed in relation to potential covariates (animal sex, date, behavior, treatment, handling time, air temperature, home-range size, precipitation and annual plant production) among seasons and years. CORT values in males were higher than in females, and values for both varied monthly throughout the activity season and among years. Year and sex were strong predictors of CORT, and translocation explained little in terms of CORT.

Comparing behavioral traits of translocated individuals with those of sympatric or nearby resident individuals can provide an ecologically relevant baseline to determine if translocated individuals show behavioral traits consistent with those of long-term residents. We used radio telemetry to concurrently monitor 21 translocated and 15 resident gopher tortoises across 2 sites in southern Georgia and compared movement patterns, body weights, and multi-scale habitat selection between treatments. Translocated tortoises moved farther and had larger home ranges than resident tortoises but showed similar patterns of site fidelity. We observed no differences in body weight change between treatments. Patterns of habitat selection were similar between treatments in that tortoises selected structurally open habitats at all scales. Our study suggests that more extensive post-release movements compared to resident individuals may not necessarily lead to lower site fidelity in translocated individuals. We suspect that the presence of structurally suitable habitat within the release area and retaining translocated individuals within a pre-release enclosure for 10 months contributed to high site fidelity.

Despite the popularity of translocations as a conservation technique, translocations are often not successful as a result of excessive movement, poor release site fidelity, and low survival. This study compares the movement patterns, site fidelity, and survival probability of resident and hard-released musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus) in a complex of patchy distributed wetlands. Our results are different from most translocation studies as the majority of translocated turtles had movement (minimum convex polygon area, total distance moved, number of wetlands used, and the number of movement shifts between wetlands), release site fidelity, and wetland fidelity patterns that were similar to resident turtles. In addition, the survival probabilities of resident and translocated turtles were both high. We believe the combination of poor overland movement capabilities and the patchy distribution of wetlands surrounded by a strong boundary matrix of terrestrial habitat, potentially increased the costs of leaving the wetland. The high costs of travelling overland to more distant wetlands may have constrained the translocated turtles dispersal from the release site and increased release site fidelity.

To date, there has been limited retrospective evaluation on the impact of recovery plans, despite an increasing interest in evaluating recovery planning motivated by demands for greater accountability and a shift away from single-species focused strategies to multi-species, landscape and ecosystem-based plans. In the context of threatened species management in Australia, we aimed to investigate whether listed species with recovery plans are more likely to have improved their status compared to listed species without recovery plans. Since 1999, over 600 draft and approved recovery plans have been developed for more than 850 of 1663 species currently listed threatened species in Australia. We applied a novel econometric matching analysis to reduce biases associated with the non-random selection of species for listing and recovery planning. We found that the presence or absence of a recovery plan did not have a statistically significant effect on whether a species' status was improving, stable or declining. The result suggests that recovery plans may not be useful in the short term and uncertainty persists about whether or not they make a long term contribution to species recovery. One major contributing factor is the lack of basic accounting of recovery planning efforts. This limits our ability to refute or confirm the impact of recovery planning on species status, and has the potential to reduce public confidence in government expenditures.

Herbaceous ground cover in olive groves creates heterogeneous patchworks that differ as regards how intensively farmed olive groves are structured and composed, which may lead to a decrease in this loss of biodiversity. Reptiles rapidly respond to changes in vegetation and other habitat disturbances, in spite of which, this taxa has received very little attention with regard to their vulnerability to agriculture systems. In this study, we investigated the response of a squamate reptile assemblage to different management systems in olive groves. Reptile communities were recorded in areas with three types of olive grove management systems: bare ground, natural cover crop, and monospecific cover crop. We further compared habitat structure and vegetation richness in the study area in order to verify if management systems have an impact on the frequency of occurrence and diversity of squamate reptiles species within olive groves. The community composition of reptiles differed among the three management systems, although this was modulated by the age of the olive trees. Our results show that the squamate reptile communities were more restricted in areas of intense management (bare ground) than in those with cover crops. When herbaceous covers existed, natural ground cover harboured a more diverse community. Our data suggest that while monospecific cover crops improve the frequency of occurrence of reptiles, species richness does not increase; however, more heterogeneous herbaceous ground cover (which, for instance, contain more species and are more similar to natural vegetation) would be a better solution regarding the promotion of diversity in reptile assemblages in agricultural landscapes. Finally our results may be used to improve the habitat quality of squamate reptile communities in similar woody crops like vineyards or orchards, where cover crops are beginning to be implemented.","Herbaceous cover enhances the squamate reptile community in woody crops",0

We restored degraded rock outcrops by placing artificial rocks at sites where natural rocks had been removed. We measured growth rates and survival in velvet geckos Oedura lesueurii at control and restored sites over a 2-year period. Gecko growth rates were unaffected by habitat restoration, but restoring sites with artificial rocks increased the overall numbers of lizards detected (both adults and juveniles). The apparent survival rates of adult male lizards (as estimated using mark) were not significantly affected by habitat restoration.

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of long-distance translocation on the white-lipped pit viper (Trimeresurus albolabris) in South China, where they are routinely removed from urban areas or homes and translocated into national parks. Using radio telemetry, we compared the ecology and biology of ‘resident’ and ‘translocated’ snakes to determine if long-distance translocation (> 3 km) is a viable conservation option. Translocation extended the period over which predation occurred and significantly decreased survival. Translocated snakes made unidirectional movements away from points of release, yet these movements were not oriented towards points of origin and there was no evidence for homing behavior. Translocation significantly increased frequency of movements and distances moved by female snakes, but no such differences were observed for male snakes. In contrast with resident snakes, translocated snakes did not show synchrony in the onset of brumation, and translocation appeared to negatively affect reproduction in both males and females. Our results suggest that long-distance translocation is not the best management approach to handle nuisance individuals of this species.

The proportions of eggs lost from raccoon-predated nests did not differ between caged and uncaged nests. Caging did not prevent destruction by swine but median survival time for caged nests was 11.5 days longer than for uncaged nests, indicating that caged eggs in nests have a greater chance of hatching before being predated by swine.

To explore homing behavior and movement patterns after translocation, we radio tracked 80 tortoises during a 2-phase experimental translocation. Phase 1 included 40 tortoises that were translocated, then monitored for a period of 37 days (21 Sep-28 Oct 2009), and phase 2 included a different group of 40 tortoises that were translocated and then monitored for 186 days (13 Apr-20 Oct 2010). In both phases, we assigned tortoises randomly to 1 of 3 treatment groups: translocated (displaced 2, 5, or 8 km from their source location), handling control, or control. After translocation, 20% of the translocated tortoises were able to navigate to their source location, and translocation distance had an effect on their ability to navigate home. We found 44% of tortoises in the 2-km translocated group returned home; 1 tortoise in the 5-km group, and no tortoises in the 8-km translocated group returned. The time required to reach home ranged from 5 to 37 days for the 2-km group, and 34 days for the 5-km group. We deemed tortoises to have homed successfully if they returned to their source location within 37 days of translocation as this reflected the duration of phase 1 and allowed for a balanced comparison between the 2 phases. We found that translocated tortoises moved at least 1.5 times more overall than the control groups, with some individuals moving >10 km from the translocation site. These patterns persisted even after accounting for seasonal and sex differences in distance traveled. By identifying homing behaviors and quantifying post-translocation movement patterns, this experiment addressed a key data gap in tortoise behavior that may limit the efficacy of tortoise translocation efforts. Our results point to the need to account for behavioral responses of tortoises to minimize risk to translocated individuals and maximize the success of translocation projects.","The effects of homing and movement behaviors on translocation: Desert tortoises in the western Mojave Desert",0

Nest protection techniques vary but wire box cages and plastic mesh screens are two common tools used to deter predation by a host of beach-foraging, opportunistic mammalian predators. We empirically tested the efficacy of wire cages and plastic mesh screens in preventing red fox Vulpes vulpes predation on artificial nests. Both techniques averted fox predation (0%), whereas unprotected control nests suffered 33% predation under conditions of normal predator motivation, or a level of motivation stimulated by loggerhead turtle egg scent. However, in side-by-side comparisons under conditions of presumed high predator motivation, 25% of mesh screens were breached whereas no cage-protected nests were successfully predated. In addition to effectiveness at preventing predation, factors such as cost, ease of use, deployment time, and magnetic disturbance were evaluated.

We tested the efficacy of two BRDs designed to exclude turtles from fyke nets by comparing catch rates and composition to unmodified nets. We also tested the efficacy of a BRD designed to let turtles escape the net by comparing turtle and fish escape capacities to a large hole in the net. The exclusion device with bars across the net opening significantly reduced turtle catch rates, and both exclusion devices did not affect fish catch rates. With the escape device, all turtles escaped (using painted turtles, Chrysemys picta, as an experimental model) and most (88%) fish were retained while a large hole allowed 60% and 77% of turtles and fish to escape, respectively. The escape device was the most effective for avoiding turtle bycatch mortality while retaining fish.

A major campaign to eradicate nonnative goats and burros was initiated in 1995 on Alcedo Volcano in the Galápagos Archipelago that ultimately removed 62,868 goats and eliminated them by 2006. Planners of the eradication program had the foresight to invest in intensive monitoring of the status of the volcano's giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra) population whose welfare was a primary motivation for the eradication effort. Monitoring revealed an increase in the proportion of juveniles among all tortoises as well as increased growth rates of individual tortoises on Alcedo Volcano from earlier to later phases of the eradication campaign. Over the same time frame in a control population on nearby Santa Cruz Island (where goats and donkeys were not removed) juvenile fraction and individual growth rates remained unchanged.

Despite often being designed for larger mammals, crossing structures appear to enable safe crossings for a range of smaller, ground dwelling species that exhibit high vulnerability to roads. Less attention has been paid to the extent to which fauna overpasses function as habitat in their own right, an issue particularly relevant to reptiles and amphibians. The Compton Road fauna array (Brisbane, Australia) includes a vegetated fauna overpass which connects two urban forest reserves and traverses a major four lane arterial road. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which colonisation of the Compton Road fauna overpass by reptile and amphibian species living in adjacent forests occurred. Pitfall sampling at seven sampling sites occurred between June 2005 and February 2010, starting approximately six months after overpass construction, with additional observational detections throughout this period. The overpass yielded higher species diversity and capture rates compared with the forest areas. Species accumulation curves demonstrated a strong and consistent colonisation rate of the overpass throughout the six year monitoring period, while persistent occupation by species on the overpass throughout the six years suggests permanent colonisation of the vegetated structure as an extension of the natural forest habitat. These outcomes demonstrate that the fauna overpass at Compton Road provides suitable habitat for diverse local herpetofauna communities and suggest enhanced habitat connectivity across the road.","Vegetated fauna overpass enhances habitat connectivity for forest dwelling herpetofauna",0

In this study, we examined the effectiveness of illuminating nets with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) placed on floatlines in order to reduce sea turtle bycatch in a smallscale bottom-set gillnet fishery. In Sechura Bay, northern Peru, 114 pairs of control and illuminated nets were deployed. The predicted mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) of target species, standardized for environmental variables using generalized additive model (GAM) analysis, was similar for both control and illuminated nets. In contrast, the predicted mean CPUE of green turtles Chelonia mydas was reduced by 63.9% in illuminated nets. A total of 125 green turtles were caught in control nets, while 62 were caught in illuminated nets. This statistically significant re duction (GAM analysis, p < 0.05) in sea turtle bycatch suggests that net illumination could be an effective conservation tool. Challenges to implementing the use of LEDs include equipment costs, increased net handling times, and limited awareness among fishermen regarding the effectiveness of this technology. Cost estimates for preventing a single sea turtle catch are as low as 34 USD, while the costs to outfit the entire gillnet fishery in Sechura Bay can be as low as 9200 USD. Understanding these cost challenges emphasizes the need for institutional support from national ministries, inter-national non-governmental organizations and the broader fisheries industry to make possible widespread implementation of net illumination as a sea turtle bycatch reduction strategy.","Reducing green turtle bycatch in small-scale fisheries using illuminated gillnets: The cost of saving a sea turtle",0

However, there have been no studies that have tested whether 'turtle-friendly' lights are benign to hatchling sea turtle sea-finding ability. Aims We tested two different types of 'turtle-friendly' lights (LED amber-light peak intensity 620nm and LED red-light peak intensity 640nm) to see whether they are disruptive to the sea-finding ability of eastern-coast Australian loggerhead turtle hatchlings. Methods Using standard circular-arena experiments, we assessed the directional preference of newly emerged loggerhead turtle hatchlings from the Woongarra Coast of Queensland, Australia, during different moon phases without artificial lighting and in the presence of 'turtle-friendly' lights. Key results Contrary to expectations, sea-finding ability of hatchlings was disrupted by the amber lights, particularly in the absence of a moon. The less intense red lights were less disruptive to hatchlings; however, misorientation and disorientation events still occurred when lights were within 4m of hatchlings. The disruptive impact on sea-finding ability increased with the cumulative impact of multiple lights increasing light intensity. Conclusions The 'turtle-friendly' lights we used disrupted the sea-finding ability of eastern-coast Australian loggerhead turtle hatchlings, with the most pronounced disruption occurring under moonless conditions.

Furthermore, nesting habitat loss can concentrate nesting, increasing nest predator efficiency. We describe how the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island created nesting habitat for Malaclemys terrapin (Diamondback Terrapin), and document nesting success in response to construction progress and the absence of raccoons and foxes, the primary nest predators. We monitored terrapin nests throughout the nesting seasons from 2002 to 2011 to determine overall and within-nest survivorship. Female terrapins began nesting on the restoration project within 1 year but planned construction during the study eliminated some nesting areas and opened previously inaccessible areas. Overall, nest survivorship was considerably higher than mainland nesting areas due to the absence of raccoons and foxes on the island and within-nest survivorship was similar. Egg size, hatchling size, and the frequency of shell scute anomalies were similar to other terrapin populations, suggesting normal developmental conditions on the island. We documented annual variation in hatchling size that correlated negatively with mean air temperature during the incubation season. Our results indicate that restored or created isolated island habitat can be located rapidly by terrapins and can become an important source of recruitment in regions where nesting habitat is limited and predation is high. Poplar Island illustrates how habitat loss and restoration can affect turtle populations by revealing the changes in nesting patterns and success in newly created, predator-free habitat.","Nesting Habitat Creation Enhances Recruitment in a Predator-Free Environment: Malaclemys Nesting at the Paul S.

With reptiles, headstarts are often kept active year-round to achieve body size goals and increase survival, omitting overwintering (brumation). As brumation is part of the life cycle of reptiles, there may be tradeoffs related to temperature response post-release when reptiles are kept active. Upon release into habitats, reptiles are either soft released, where acclimation is provided with in situ enclosures, or hard released without acclimation, directly into habitat. Soft releases have resulted in greater survival and site fidelity than hard releases, but evaluations with snakes are rare. We used a comparative approach to examine effects of brumation versus year-round activity on prerelease growth and survival of smooth green snake Opheodrys vernalis headstarts. We estimated short-term post-release daily survival rates of headstarts and compared movements of hard and soft released snakes. Despite decreases in body mass during brumation, prerelease body size, growth rate and survival did not differ among brumation treatments. Brumated headstarts exhibited rapid compensatory growth, attaining the size of active headstarts within 2 months of brumation. We observed qualitative evidence of reproductive potential in brumated snakes with the production of spermatozoa and unfertilized eggs, which was absent in active headstarts. The short-term survival rate of all headstarts during post-release tracking was 0.83 (±0.01), but we lacked power to examine differences in survival among release treatments. Daily movements did not differ among release treatments. Soft releases had slightly greater recaptures, facilitating monitoring. Although brumation comparisons produced equivalent prerelease growth and survival, as a precautionary measure for post-release survival, we recommend incorporating brumation into headstarting efforts.

One factor potentially limiting success is dispersal of individuals from the release site immediately after translocation and consequent non-overlap of ranges. 'Penning' involves the use of an enclosure to restrict dispersal of translocated animals for a pre-determined period of time, with the aim of habituating animals to the release site so that they will establish a breeding population. We evaluated the utility of penning for limiting post-translocation dispersal of jewelled geckos (Naultinus gemmeus) by simultaneously tracking 19 geckos that had either been translocated into a pen for 9-10 months prior to the pen's removal (n=10) or were translocated to a nearby site with no physical barrier to dispersal (n=9) over a 3-week period. The area occupied by penned geckos did not increase following removal of their pen, despite suitable habitat being available outside the pen area. In contrast, un-penned geckos moved distances of up to 40m outside of their release area, and effectively increased the area that they were occupying as a group 4.4-fold over the 3-week period. We suspect that when Naultinus geckos are released without time in a pen, some individuals may disperse too far to contribute to a breeding population and, consequently, the likelihood of population establishment and rate of population growth may be diminished. Our hypothesis is supported by a survey we conducted the following summer in which all four adult female geckos found at the penned site were gravid, but neither of the females resighted at the un-penned site was gravid. We believe that the potential advantages of penning (e.g. restricting initial dispersal, increased ease of monitoring) may outweigh the disadvantages (e.g. cost) for many herpetofauna translocations.","Penning prior to release decreases postâ€translocation dispersal of jewelled geckos",0

At least some failures may be forestalled by developing clear goals and success criteria, having a better understanding of the species' biology and the threats it faces, ensuring the quality of the site to which individuals are being moved and following through with long-term monitoring. We incorporated these considerations into a translocation that moved more than 500 individuals of the threatened Florida sand skink Plestiodon reynoldsiStejneger from a site slated for mining to an apparently suitable, but unoccupied site. Translocated individuals were placed into enclosures at the recipient site at densities similar to those at the donor site. Environmental conditions were varied within the enclosures in a replicated design, to tease out the conditions that promote successful colonization by translocated individuals. Overall success of the translocation will be judged by population viability, but we also set two benchmarks (initial survival and reproduction; completion of the life cycle through subsequent recruitment of offspring) to monitor progress. So far, we have monitored the translocated individuals long enough to determine that they have survived and are reproducing. Modeling of the influence of the environment on successful establishment suggests that soil and light conditions are important influences, but in a complex way that implicates the overriding importance of habitat heterogeneity. The Florida sand skink appears to be a resilient species that exploits the available habitat heterogeneity to find suitable microhabitats, and we suggest that these characteristics of the habitat and species contributed to its successful meeting of the first benchmark.

Meshing of nests with fox exclusion devices (FEDs) was undertaken in all years accompanied by lethal fox control in the first five-year period, but not in the second five-year period. Lethal fox control was undertaken in the study area from 2005 to February 2010, but foxes still breached 27% (range19-52%) of turtle nests. In the second five-year period, despite the absence of lethal fox control, the average percentage of nests breached was less than 3% (range 0-4%). Comparison of clutch depredation rates in the two five-year periods demonstrated that continuous nest meshing may be more effective than lethal fox control in mitigating the impact of foxes on turtle nests. In the absence of unlimited resources available for the eradication of exotic predators, the use of FEDs and the support and resourcing of a dedicated volunteer base can be considered an effective turtle conservation tool on some beaches.","Anti-predator meshing may provide greater protection for sea turtle nests than predator removal",0

Wildlife farming has been proposed to promote sustainable trade, but characterizing markets and understanding consumer behavior remain neglected but essential steps in the design and evaluation of such operations. We used sea turtle trade in the Cayman Islands, where turtles have been farm raised for human consumption for almost 50 years, as a case study to explore consumer preferences toward wild-sourced (illegal) and farmed (legal) products and potential conservation implications. Combining methods innovatively (including indirect questioning and choice experiments), we conducted a nationwide trade assessment through in-person interviews from September to December 2014. Households were randomly selected using disproportionate stratified sampling, and responses were weighted based on district population size. We approached 597 individuals, of which 37 (6.2%) refused to participate. Although 30% of households had consumed turtle in the previous 12 months, the purchase and consumption of wild products was rare (e.g., 64–742 resident households consumed wild turtle meat [i.e., 0.3–3.5% of households] but represented a large threat to wild turtles in the area due to their reduced populations). Differences among groups of consumers were marked, as identified through choice experiments, and price and source of product played important roles in their decisions. Despite the long-term practice of farming turtles, 13.5% of consumers showed a strong preference for wild products, which demonstrates the limitations of wildlife farming as a single tool for sustainable wildlife trade. By using a combination of indirect questioning, choice experiments, and sales data to investigate demand for wildlife products, we obtained insights about consumer behavior that can be used to develop conservation-demand-focused initiatives. Lack of data from long-term social–ecological assessments hinders the evaluation of and learning from wildlife farming. This information is key to understanding under which conditions different interventions (e.g., bans, wildlife farming, social marketing) are likely to succeed.","Understanding implications of consumer behavior for wildlife farming and sustainable wildlife trade",0

We measured their effects on survival of a translocated population of an endangered lizard in New Zealand. Twelve captive-reared Otago skinks (Oligosoma otagense) were translocated to a 0.3-ha area of grassland/shrubland cleared of invasive mammals and surrounded by a mammal-resistant fence. Sixteen more skinks were released 2 years later but this was followed by an incursion of mice for c. 160 days. Peak mouse density was at least 63 per hectare, and they were seen attacking adult skinks (> 25 cm in length), which is previously undocumented for this lizard species. Using photo/re-sight methods and Program MARK, we estimated skink survival (phi) and detectability (p) in the presence of mice (second cohort: phi = 0.15 per annum, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.01 - 0.48; p = 0.28, 0.20 - 0.38) and in their absence (first cohort: phi = 0.44 p.a., 95% CI 0.03 - 0.82; p = 0.29, 0.22 - 0.39). Survival of skinks from the first cohort during the mouse incursion was unaffected, presumably because they were already established and had access to familiar or more optimal refugia. Their survival over the entire 3 years of monitoring (0.83, 95% CI 0.60 - 0.93) compared favourably with published estimates for viable populations in the wild, protected from all invasive mammals.

Over two years of observation no in situ nests survived due to predation, while emergence success in relocated nests varied between the years. Temperatures above 34°C experienced by the nests over at least three consecutive days during incubation (T3dm) had decreased emergence success in both years. These high temperatures occurred as a result of metabolic heating of developing embryos combined with high sand temperatures. The indirect method of determining sex ratios from nest temperature profiles indicated that the hatchery at APNP generated more male hatchlings than female.

In the present study we assessed the species richness, diversity, abundance, and functional guilds of amphibians and reptiles inside and outside of the NPA Reserva Estatal de la Biósfera Sierra San Juan (REBSSJ), Nayarit, Mexico. Our results showed that species numbers of amphibian and reptiles were higher outside than inside the reserve, as well the individual number distributed among species, except for lizard species.

Likewise, outside the reserve we recorded a higher species number with some category of risk at the national level (NOM-059), international level (IUCN), and also by using the Environmental Vulnerability Score (EVS) algorithm. The results suggest that areas outside of the reserve are crucial to the maintenance of regional biodiversity, due to high complementarity with species composition inside of the reserves. These data can be used to implement conservation measures that include a new demarcation of the reserve and the consideration of surrounding areas to include a great number of species.","Herpetofauna inside and outside from a natural protected area: The case of Reserva Estatal de la BiÃ³sfera Sierra San Juan, Nayarit, Mexico",0

Treatments were mechanical understory removal (twice), prescribed burning (4 times; burn-only), mechanical understory removal followed 1 year later by high-severity prescribed burns and 3 subsequent burns (mechanical + burn), and untreated controls. Initial burns were hotter in mechanical + burn than burn-only units, resulting in heavy tree mortality and increased canopy openness within 2 growing-seasons post-burn. We captured 4,606 individuals of 15 amphibian and 20 reptile species. Capture rates of American toads (Anaxyrus americanus), green frogs (Lithobates clamitans), plethodontid salamanders (Plethodon spp.), and northern red salamanders (Pseudotriton ruber) were not affected by any fuel reduction treatment.

By that time wild saltwater crocodiles were rarely sighted anywhere and they were commercially extinct in areas where they had once been abundant. Standardized monitoring by spotlight surveys started in 1975 and provided relative density indices over time (1975-2009) as a unique record of the post-protection recovery of a wild crocodilian population. We examined the survey data for populations at 12 major tidal rivers, individually and as a single subpopulation. The pattern of recovery in the subpopulation in both abundance and biomass was approximated by logistic curves, predicting 5.26 non-hatchling crocodiles weighing 387.64 kg sighted per kilometer of river in 2010. We predicted potential carrying capacity as 5.58 non-hatchling crocodiles (5.73% higher than 2010) weighing 519.0 kg (25.31% higher than 2010). Individual rivers showed largely different abundance and biomass among rivers. The statistical model that best described the recovery in individual rivers was not always logistic. However, where it was logistic, expected carrying capacity of different rivers showed considerable variation in abundance and biomass. The variation indicates different habitat quality among the rivers. Recovery occurred despite various consumptive uses, particularly a widespread egg-harvest program, which has been an integral part of the incentive-driven conservation program for saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory since 1983. We suggest that the saltwater crocodile population of the Northern Territory is achieving full recovery from uncontrolled hunting in 1945-1971. Although saltwater crocodiles are considered an important natural resource, their increase in number, size, and distribution is posing management issues for public safety.

A highway expansion project in Ontario, Canada included exclusion fencing and ecopassages as mitigation measures designed to offset detrimental effects to one of the most imperial groups of vertebrates, reptiles. Taking a multispecies approach, we used a Before-After-Control-Impact study design to compare reptile abundance on the highway before and after mitigation at an Impact site and a Control site from 1 May to 31 August in 2012 and 2013. During this time, radio telemetry, wildlife cameras, and an automated PIT-tag reading system were used to monitor reptile movements and use of ecopassages. Additionally, a willingness to utilize experiment was conducted to quantify turtle behavioral responses to ecopassages. We found no difference in abundance of turtles on the road between the un-mitigated and mitigated highways, and an increase in the percentage of both snakes and turtles detected dead on the road post-mitigation, suggesting that the fencing was not effective. Although ecopassages were used by reptiles, the number of crossings through ecopassages was lower than road-surface crossings. Furthermore, turtle willingness to use ecopassages was lower than that reported in previous arena studies, suggesting that effectiveness of ecopassages may be compromised when alternative crossing options are available (e.g., through holes in exclusion structures). Our rigorous evaluation of reptile roadway mitigation demonstrated that when exclusion structures fail, the effectiveness of population connectivity structures is compromised. Our project emphasizes the need to design mitigation measures with the biology and behavior of the target species in mind, to implement mitigation designs in a rigorous fashion, and quantitatively evaluate road mitigation to ensure allow for adaptive management and optimization of these increasingly important conservation tools.","Mitigating reptile road mortality: Fence failures compromise ecopassage effectiveness",0

Yet, protected areas are influenced by the surrounding anthropogenic matrix as degradation of landscapes used by humans also has negative consequences on species within the adjacent protected, non-degraded ecosystems. Increasing the heterogeneity of the anthropogenic landscape has the potential to promote biodiversity conservation in protected and non-protected sites. To find options for reconciling land use and biodiversity conservation, we evaluated reptile diversity of two areas. Both areas contained three types of habitat: cultivated areas, degraded forest and undegraded forest. In one area (Tsim), a network of hedges surrounding fields provided a variety of possible resources for reptile species. Another area (Andremba) lacked such landscape elements. In 480 survey walks on 48 transects evenly distributed over two areas, we recorded a total of 24 reptile species, of which 18 occurred in both areas. Perennial plant cover explained the variation in local (per transect) species richness best. Species richness was low along field margins in the cultivated area that lacked hedges and had a perennial plant cover below 20%. It was high in undegraded and degraded forest and along hedges in the cultivated area where perennial plant cover was above 40%. Similarities of reptile assemblages were higher between habitat types in the area structurally enriched with hedges, than in the area lacking such enrichment. In the latter area, beta diversity was largely the result of species losses which could result from impeded movement between habitats. Synthesis and applications. A continuous network of hedges and associated trees and shrubs contribute to the maintenance of reptile biodiversity in dry south-western Madagascar. When present, these interconnected landscape elements enhance habitat suitability of the agriculturally used matrix. They also provide habitat for species of conservation concern. High similarity between assemblages in the area with hedges indicated that movement between habitats was facilitated. We conclude that incorporating hedges in pastures contributes not just to the suitability of the matrix, but also enhances landscape connectivity and thus improves biodiversity conservation in the human-used landscape.","A structurally enriched agricultural landscape maintains high reptile diversity in sub-arid south-western Madagascar",0

Changes in grass snake Natrix natrix, common lizard Zootoca vivipara, slow worm Anguis fragilis and sand lizard Lacerta agilis numbers were recorded annually in the ungrazed area and in a four hectare area of heathland adjacent to it that continued to be grazed. The number of grass snake, common lizard and slow worm sightings were significantly higher in the ungrazed heath than the grazed heath and were associated with increased habitat structure, resulting principally from increased height and cover of grasses, particularly Molinia caerulea. Conversely, there was no significant difference in the number of adult sand lizard sightings between the grazed and ungrazed heath though sighting frequency was inversely correlated with both grass and grass litter cover. Our results suggest that the use of cattle grazing as a management tool on lowland heath is detrimental to grass snake, slow worm and common lizard populations but may be less so to adult sand lizards. Although newborn slow worms and common lizards were observed throughout the study area, significantly fewer were found in the grazed areas than the ungrazed areas.

Predator-exclusion cages are effectively used to reduce predation of turtle nests; however, their effects on nest environment and developing hatchlings have not been examined. Aims Our study had the following four goals: (1) to examine effects of cages on the nest environment, (2) determine whether nest caging affects proxies for hatchling fitness, (3) evaluate whether nest predators preferentially interact with certain cage types, and (4) assess the cost-effectiveness of different nest caging designs. Methods In 2010 and 2011 in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, painted turtle (Chrysemys picta; n=93) and snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina; n=91) nests were assigned to one of three treatments (wooden-sided cages, above- and below-ground wire cages) or a control (no nest cage) and outfitted with a data logger to record incubation temperature. After emergence, hatching success and proxies of hatchling fitness were measured. Key results Nest temperature, hatching success, frequency of hatchling deformities and locomotor performance did not differ among cage treatments. However, hatchling body condition differed among treatments; wooden-sided and below-ground cages had the most positive influence on body condition in painted and snapping turtles, respectively. Predator interactions did not differ among treatments, and wooden-sided cages were the most inexpensive to construct. Conclusions Nest cages did not alter the nest environment from natural conditions but did alter hatchling body condition, and nest caging affected species differently. Implications Nest cages are known to reduce nest depredation, and our data indicated that, in general, nest cages also do not affect the nest environment or proxies for hatchling fitness. Thus, our findings indicated that cages are effective conservation tools that do not present secondary deleterious effects on potential recruitment. © CSIRO 2013.","Evaluation of predator-exclusion cages used in turtle conservation: Cost analysis and effects on nest environment and proxies of hatchling fitness",0

We used a global meta-analysis of 345 stocks to assess whether fisheries under catch shares were more likely to track management targets set for sustainable harvest than fisheries managed only by fleet-wide quota caps or effort controls. We examined three ratios: catch-to-quota, current exploitation rate to target exploitation rate and current biomass to target biomass. For each, we calculated the mean response, variation around the target and the frequency of undesirable outcomes with respect to these targets. Regional effects were stronger than any other explanatory variable we examined. After accounting for region, we found the effects of catch shares primarily on catch-to-quota ratios: these ratios were less variable over time than in other fisheries. Over-exploitation occurred in only 9% of stocks under catch shares compared to 13% of stocks under fleet-wide quota caps. Additionally, over-exploitation occurred in 41% of stocks under effort controls, suggesting a substantial benefit of quota caps alone. In contrast, there was no evidence for a response in the biomass of exploited populations because of either fleet-wide quota caps or individual catch shares. Thus, for many fisheries, management controls improve under catch shares in terms of reduced variation in catch around quota targets, but ecological benefits in terms of increased biomass may not be realized by catch shares alone. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Can catch share fisheries better track management targets?",0

Furthermore, logistic regression models were applied to investigate the effects of a range of explanatory factors on the probability of individual fish being discarded. Results indicate that discarding on the vessels sampled has declined from an average of 54% of the total common megrim catch in 2009 to 20% in 2012. The decrease in total discards was primarily a result of a decrease in the proportions of discards categorized by the crew as small within the catches from 0.39 (±0.02 s.e.) in 2009 to 0.10 (±0.01 s.e.) in 2012. Model outputs also suggest that the likelihood of a fish being discarded decreases significantly (p < 0.001) with increasing quota. The current megrim total allowable catch serves only to regulate landings and does little to regulate fishing mortality.

Although the status (biomass and fishing mortality rate) of major tuna and billfish stocks is well documented, the effect of these diverse factors on current stock status and the effect of management measures in rebuilding stocks have not been analysed at the global level. Here, we show that, particularly for tunas, stocks were more depleted if they had high commercial value, were long-lived species, had small pre-fishing biomass and were subject to intense fishing pressure for a long time. In addition, implementing and enforcing total allowable catches (TACs) had the strongest positive influence on rebuilding overfished tuna and billfish stocks. Other control rules such as minimum size regulations or seasonal closures were also important in reducing fishing pressure, but stocks under TAC implementations showed the fastest increase of biomass.

This diversity in the degree of harvest rights may influence the effectiveness of IQ fisheries to meet management objectives. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 167 stocks managed under IQs to test whether the strength of harvest rights impacts the conservation status of stocks in terms of catch, exploitation rate and biomass relative to management targets. We used non-parametric methods to assess non-linear relationships and linear regression models to explicitly consider interactions among predictors. Most IQ fisheries consistently met fleet-wide quota limits (94% of stocks had recent catches below or within 10% of quotas), but only 2/3 of IQ fisheries adhered to sustainable management targets for biomass and exploitation rate (68% of stocks had exploitation rates below or within 10% of targets and 63% of stocks had biomass above or within 10% of biomass targets). Strikingly, when exclusivity of the harvesting privilege was low, exploitation rates depended on whether IQ implementation was industry-driven (exploitation below targets) or government-mandated (exploitation above targets). At high levels of exclusivity, exploitation rates converged to just below management targets. Transferability of quota units was associated with stock biomass closer to and slightly above target levels than stocks with non-transferable quota.

Estimations of the spatial apportionment of blue ling landings within and outside the protection areas are achieved by combining low-resolution data from fishing vessel logbook entries with higher-resolution vessel monitoring system (VMS) data.

This study used fishery-independent longline and gill-net surveys to investigate the effects of sub-bay-sized MPAs (c. 100–300 km2) on the abundance and community structure of tropical coastal sharks. In addition, tag–recapture data from fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources were used to investigate the movements of individuals across MPA boundaries. Species composition varied significantly between management zones, and overall shark abundance on longlines was higher inside MPAs. Length–frequency distributions of blacktip (Carcharhinus tilstoni/Carcharhinus limbatus) and pigeye (Carcharhinus amboinensis) sharks inside MPAs included a greater proportion of sharks larger than c. 800 mm compared with those in open zones, although results varied between gear types for pigeye sharks. Tagging and recapture locations indicated repeated and potentially long-term use of MPAs by individuals of some species. Although the potential benefits of MPAs were not equal for all species, coastal MPAs may increase the survival of young sharks to maturity, or shelter parts of breeding stocks, and therefore do not necessarily need to be large to provide benefits.

To date, the IndiSeas programme (Indicators for the Seas) has focussed on assessing the ecological impacts of fishing at the ecosystem scale using ecological indicators. Here, we explore fisheries ‘Management Effectiveness’ and ‘Governance Quality’ and relate this to ecosystem health and status. We developed a dedicated expert survey, focused at the ecosystem level, with a series of questions addressing aspects of management and governance, from an ecosystem-based perspective, using objective and evidence-based criteria. The survey was completed by ecosystem experts (managers and scientists) and results analysed using ranking and multivariate methods. Results were further examined for selected ecosystems, using expert knowledge, to explore the overall findings in greater depth. Higher scores for ‘Management Effectiveness’ and ‘Governance Quality’ were significantly and positively related to ecosystems with better ecological status. Key factors that point to success in delivering fisheries and conservation objectives were as follows: the use of reference points for management, frequent review of stock assessments, whether Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) catches were being accounted for and addressed, and the inclusion of stakeholders. Additionally, we found that the implementation of a long-term management plan, including economic and social dimensions of fisheries in exploited ecosystems, was a key factor in successful, sustainable fisheries management. Our results support the thesis that good ecosystem-based management and governance, sustainable fisheries and healthy ecosystems go together.","Strong fisheries management and governance positively impact ecosystem status",1

Yet, both factors are interlinked and it remains uncertain whether autumn-sown cereals reduce breeding bird numbers also in the structurally complex arable farmland of northern Europe. We tested whether autumn-sowing of cereals at both local and landscape scales affected the breeding bird community in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape of south-central Sweden. Rotation between sowing types was used as a semi-experiment based on 34 spring- vs. 41 autumn-sown cereal plots centred on infield non-crop islands of similar structure, size and surroundings. Species richness and territory abundance of ground-foraging species were significantly lower in autumn- than in spring-sown cereal plots both in the crop fields and the infield non-crop islands during the breeding season. No such effect was observed among foliage gleaning birds. Species richness in spring-sown cereal plots was less the more autumn-sown crops in the surrounding landscape within a 500. m radius. Average skylark densities did not differ between autumn- and spring-sown cereal plots because habitat preferences changed; densities declined in autumn-sown cereals during the growing season whereas they increased on spring-sown fields which had shorter swards throughout the breeding season. Our results indicate that negative effects of autumn-sown crops on breeding bird numbers spill over into both neighbouring non-crop and crop habitats. We conclude that agri-environmental schemes should place more emphasis on facilitating the value of the cropped area of fields as a foraging and nesting habitat. The retention of various non-crop habitats alone may not provide sufficient food close to nest sites for farmland birds that rely on crop fields for foraging. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Autumn-sowing of cereals reduces breeding bird numbers in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape",1
"CE_2901","CE",2901,2011,NA,"Biological Conservation","Declines of farmland birds have been pronounced in landscapes dominated by lowland livestock production and densities of seed-eating birds are particularly low in such areas. Modern livestock production often entails a simple cropping system dominated by ley grassland and maize grown for animal feed. These crops often lack invertebrate and seed resources for foraging birds and can be hostile nesting environments. Cereal-based wholecrop silages (CBWCS) offer potential benefits for farmland birds because they can be grown with minimal herbicide applications and can be spring-sown with following winter stubbles. We compared the biodiversity benefits and agronomic yields of winter-sown wheat and spring-sown barley as alternatives to grass and maize silage in intensive dairy livestock systems. Seed-eating birds foraged mainly in CBWCS fields during summer, and mainly on barley stubbles during winter and this reflected the higher densities of seed-bearing plants therein. Maize and grass fields lacked seed-bearing vegetation and were strongly avoided by most seed-eating birds. Production costs of CBWCS are similar to those of maize and lower than those of grass silage. Selective (rather than broad-spectrum) herbicide application on spring barley crops increased forb cover, reduced yields (by 11%) but caused only a small (<4%) increase in production costs. CBWCS grown with selective herbicide and with following winter stubbles offer a practical conservation measure for seed-eating farmland birds in landscapes dominated by intensively-managed grassland and maize. However, the relatively early harvesting of CBWCS could destroy a significant proportion of breeding attempts of late-nesting species like corn bunting (Emberiza calandra) or yellow wagtail (Motocilla flava). Where late-breeding species are likely to nest in CBWCS fields, harvesting should be delayed until most nesting attempts have been completed (e.g. until after 1st August in southern Britain). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Cereal-based wholecrop silages: a potential conservation measure for farmland birds in pastoral landscapes",0

However, there have been recent declines and the colonies continue to face ongoing threats from habitat change and excessive commercial harvesting of their eggs, as well as potential threats by commercial fishing and climate change. A possible method to counter these threats is to re-establish breeding colonies on islands from which they have disappeared. An attempt was made to attract birds to a previously occupied island through habitat management, decoy birds and playback of recorded sooty tern calls. Habitat preparation involved predator eradication and tree removal to provide open ground with bare sandy areas and low herb vegetation. Overflying birds were attracted by broadcast calls, with some circling over and landing among the decoys. Large three-dimensional plastic models were superior to other models presented. This study demonstrated that large numbers of birds can be attracted by these means and that the birds then undertook behaviour associated with breeding, including egg laying by a few birds. However, after five seasons a breeding colony has not yet been established; one possible cause is the emergence of unexpected egg predators, common moorhen Gallinula chloropus and common myna Acridotheres tristis.","Attempted re-establishment of a sooty tern Onychoprion fuscatus breeding colony on Denis Island, Seychelles",0

The number of breeding pairs of saker falcons increased at a faster rate than ravens, reflecting their social dominance. Saker falcons and common ravens preferred to breed inside closed-box artificial nests with a roof, whereas upland buzzards preferred open-top nests. For saker falcons nest survival was higher in closed nests than open nests but there was no significant difference in laying date, clutch size and brood size in relation to nest design. This study demonstrates that whilst nest boxes can increase breeding populations in nest site limited habitats, nest design may also influence occupancy rates and breeding productivity of the species utilizing them.

Consequently, large forest-dwelling hawks may lack nest sites as they need large trees to support their nests. Construction of artificial nests has been a globally adopted conservation measure to provide nest sites for several raptors, but the impact of this practice has seldom been evaluated. We compared the nesting success of northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis, common buzzard Buteo buteo, and honey buzzard Pernis apivorus in natural and artificial nests based on long-term data in Finland. The probability of successful nesting of goshawk and common buzzard was lower in artificial nests, whereas no difference was found in the nesting success of honey buzzard between the nest types. Brood size did not differ between natural and artificial nests in successful nests of any of the three species. Finally, distances to anthropogenic features had no effect on nesting success. These results indicate that hawks switching from natural to artificial nests are potentially lured to an ecological trap with higher risk of nesting failure. However, breeding at artificial nests, even with lower success than in natural nests, can still add to the population, if otherwise nonbreeding individuals settle to nest.

However, less evidence is available from the tropics as to the benefits of rat eradication. Here, we report the seabird recovery and vegetation dynamics on a small coralline island of the tropical western Indian Ocean, eight years after Norway rat (. Rattus norvegicus) eradication. Two species of seabirds were breeding before rat eradication (red-footed and masked boobies, Sula sula and Sula, dactylatra) and, in both species, the number of breeding pairs had an apparent increase of 22-23% per year after rat eradication. Such a high annual growth rate cannot be achieved by auto-recruitment only and our data suggest that immigration from other source populations never occurred in at least one of these species. We suggest that it is rather due to a rapid increase in breeding success, which rapidly increased the observed number of breeders since birds remained in the available-for-counting-as-breeders group for much longer. Two other species, the white tern (. Gygis alba) and the brown booby (. Sula leucogaster) were recorded breeding in 2014. The former species has not bred on the island since 1856 and the latter has never bred on the island. Plant cover (monospecific formation of the ruderal herb Boerhavia diffusa) dramatically increased from less than 30% of surface coverage to more than 70%. Although the initial restoration project was to eradicate all introduced mammals of the island simultaneously, house mouse (. Mus musculus) eradication failed. Mouse density was high 8. years after rat eradication (32. mice/ha in dry season and 52. mice/ha in rainy season) but not higher than at a comparable tropical island of the region (Juan de Nova) where mice coexist with introduced black rats (.

These results are discussed in terms of the direct positive effects of rat eradication on seabirds and plants and the indirect positive effects of post-eradication seabird increase on soil manuring and vegetation recovery.

Using detection- nondetection data collected during repeated call playback surveys at grazed vs. ungrazed marshes and a ""random changes in occupancy"" parameterization of a multi-season occupancy model, we examined relationships between occupancy and habitat covariates, while accounting for imperfect detection. Marsh vegetation cover was significantly lower at grazed marshes than at ungrazed marshes during the grazing season in 2007 but not in 2008. Winter- spring grazing had little effect on Black Rail occupancy at irrigated marshes. However, at nonirrigated marshes fed by natural springs and streams, grazed sites had lower occupancy than ungrazed sites. Black Rail occupancy was positively associated with marsh area, irrigation as a water source, and summer vegetation cover, and negatively associated with marsh isolation.

Average productivity (chicks/female) during 2000-2011 was 1.61 (95% C.I. 1.08-2.41) times greater at Craigmore than Abernethy. It was possible that the difference was due to increased wetting of chicks by vegetation during and after rain at Abernethy, where the vertical density of the shrub and grass layer was greater than at Craigmore. Wet chicks may then die. To test this hypothesis, 2 m wide routes were cut through tall heather Calluna vulgaris at Abernethy, so that broods could move between bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus feeding areas without having to brush against tall dense vegetation. However, there was no improvement in breeding success in the treated area compared to a control area.

Electrocution resulted from birds contacting live conductor cables either when perched at the top of the grounded steel-reinforced concrete pole or when perched on the steel crossarm. Mitigation focused on line poles and involved creating a barrier between the live conductors and perch sites at randomly selected poles. This involved attaching the pin insulator at the top of the pole with a new mount so that it was repositioned centrally to discourage birds from perching on top of the pole, while additional unconnected pin insulators were affixed adjacent to those supporting the conductor cables on the crossarm to provide a barrier to birds touching the live cables. Electrocution rates were significantly lower at mitigated poles compared to control poles, with an average reduction of 85%. This mitigation technique is relatively inexpensive to implement (approximately US$12/pole for materials), with no additional maintenance requirement and a life expectancy similar to that of the base pole design. While not eliminating electrocution risk, this mitigation technique may be useful in circumstances where the cost of implementation and sustained maintenance largely determines whether or not any form of mitigation is undertaken.","Efficacy of a mitigation method to reduce raptor electrocution at an electricity distribution line in Mongolia",0

We investigated the effect of fishing on southern Buller's albatross Thalassarche bulleri bulleri, using a new approach to seabird population modelling that allows estimation of demographic parameters from multiple data types. Three types of data were used: a 60-year set of mark-recapture observations, four censuses of the breeding population, and estimates of fishing effort and bycatch. The fisheries risk to the viability of this population over the last 60 years appears to have been small, since the adult population is estimated to have increased about fivefold over that time. There is some cause for concern in recent changes (population growth has slowed, and perhaps reversed, and adult survival rates are falling). The most common age at first breeding was 12 years, and about 80% of adults breed each year. Annual survival was estimated to bc 0.91 for juveniles, and varied between this value and 1 for adults. Though this population is not in immediate danger from fishing, there is a need for continued monitoring to see whether the recent fall in survival rates persists and causes a decline in abundance. Our analysis showed that when, as is common, mark-recapture data do not provide good estimates of all demographic rates, the assessment of seabird population trends can be improved by the use of other types of data, particularly abundance. © 2012 The Royal Society of New Zealand.","Modelling the effect of fishing on southern Buller's albatross using a 60_year dataset",0

With a total of 135 vessels, the fleet is one of the largest in Argentina. Specifically tasked seabird observers were placed onboard trawlers during the summer and winter seasons of the years 2006 and 2007. The type and number of seabird interactions (i.e. contacts with fishing gear) were recorded during shooting and hauling operations, covering 72days of observation and 328 trawls. Black-browed albatrosses, white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis, southern giant petrels Marconectes giganteus and southern royal albatrosses Diomedea epomophora were the most abundant species interacting with trawlers. Confirmed mortalities of black-browed and southern royal albatrosses were the result of collisions and entanglement with the warp cable while birds were scavenging. The estimated total mortality rate was 0.017 birds h-1 and 0.105 birds per vessel per day. The intensity of interactions (in terms of the number of contacts per unit time) was largely explained by the distribution of the fishing effort. Seasonality and the incidence of discards were the strongest factors explaining the occurrence of seabird interactions. The total annual mortality in the trawl fleet under investigation was roughly estimated to be from several hundred to over a thousand albatrosses. However, these figures should be considered preliminary due to the limited spatial and temporal coverage of data and the fact that estimations were based on a low number of observed mortalities. The implementation of a strategic discard management may significantly reduce the number of seabird mortalities from collisions with warp cables or improve the effectiveness of other complementary mitigation methods.

We reviewed the extent of seabird bycatch in all longline fisheries for which data are available. Despite the many inadequacies and assumptions contained therein, we estimated that at least 160 000 (and potentially in excess of 320 000) seabirds are killed annually. Most frequently caught are albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters, with current levels of mortality liable to be unsustainable for some species and popula- tions. Where realistic comparisons can be made, with data from the 1990s, there is evidence of sub- stantially reduced bycatch in some key fisheries. Reductions stem from decreased fishing effort (especially in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean), and greater and more effective use of technical mitigation measures, notably in demersal fisheries. However, bycatch problems in other fisheries have also emerged. Current concerns include those with previously unidentified bycatch problems (e.g. Spanish Gran Sol demersal fleet) and those where bycatch was identified, but where persistent data gaps prevented adequate assessments of the scale of the impact (e.g. Nordic demersal fisheries). Future assessments will only achieve greater precision when mini- mum standards of data collection, reporting and analysis are implemented by longline fishing fleets and the relevant regional fishery management organisations.

Our study addresses this data gap by analyzing data from 2666 Taiwanese scientific observation data sets from 2002 to 2007 to calculate the seabird bycatch rate and to estimate the mortality of seabirds as a result of fishing activities by the entire fleet. A total of 379 seabirds were caught and 88% were albatross. A negative binomial distribution was used to represent the observed data based on spatial and temporal stratification, which yielded bycatch rates that ranged from 0.0003 to 0.2213 birds per 1000 hooks. The bycatch rates were highest in the areas between 25-45°N and 165°E-160°W between October and March and the areas between 25-35°S and 170°E-165°W between April and September. Using the observed data for bycatch rates and total fishing effort, the estimated number of seabird deaths caused by the Taiwanese fleet ranged from 1120 to 4290 birds annually.

However, little is known about the nature and the spatial-temporal extent of the interactions between individual birds and vessels. By studying a system in which we had fine-scale data on bird movements and activity, and near real-time information on vessel distribution, we provide new insights on the association of a threatened albatross with fisheries. During early chick-rearing, black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophris from two different colonies (separated by only 75 km) showed significant differences in the degree of association with fisheries, despite being nearly equidistant to the Falklands fishing fleet. Most foraging trips from either colony did not bring tracked individuals close to vessels, and proportionally little time and foraging effort was spent near ships. Nevertheless, a few individuals repeatedly visited fishing vessels, which may indicate they specialise on fisheries-linked food sources and so are potentially more vulnerable to bycatch. The evidence suggests that this population has little reliance on fisheries discards at a critical stage of its nesting cycle, and hence measures to limit fisheries waste on the Patagonian shelf that also reduce vessel attractiveness and the risk of incidental mortality, would be of high overall conservation benefit. © 2011 Granadeiro et al.","Albatrosses Following Fishing Vessels: How Badly Hooked Are They on an Easy Meal",0

This applies particularly to the area of the continental slope, due to the high rates of incidental catch from pelagic longliners. We analyzed the temporal variation in the seabird assemblage associated with this fishery, identified the species that make use of discards, and evaluated their interactions while foraging. During 20 commercial fishing trips between 2005 and 2008, we completed 415 bird counts and recorded behavior in 172 of these. The observed species richness (=38 species) is greater than that reported for any other fishery in the region and was highest from October to April, although many species in the assemblage were significantly more abundant between May and September. Only 14 species made significant use of discards, and all of these were albatrosses and petrels captured incidentally. We observed within- and between-species competition for access to discards. In general, the frequency of intraspecific competition was greater in the most abundant species, during the period of their greatest abundance. Albatrosses were more successful in interspecific competitive interactions, and we observed a dominance hierarchy related to body size. We conclude that the composition and seasonality of the seabird bycatch is determined by the spatiotemporal dynamics of the assemblage and by the observed pattern of interspecific interactions. Discards from pelagic longline fleets operating in the BMC may be an important food source for at least 8 species of globally threatened seabirds.

Also, in some cases, the total number of birds decreased, relative to unprocessed discharge treatments (but not small and large albatrosses cutter treatment). Particle size may be less important for reducing abundances than temporal discharge patterns, which affected how birds tracked the discharge stream.

While there are various types of evidence of a strong impact of longline fisheries on seabirds, in particular albatrosses, the incidental bycatch mortality has never been directly linked to estimates of bycatch derived from on-board surveys. We develop a capture-recapture analysis which relates the annual probability of survival in the Black-Footed Albatross to the estimated absolute bycatch. By converting the absolute bycatch into an estimate relative to population size and using the theory of exploited populations, we show that survival probability decreases linearly with bycatch, and that the bycatch is underestimated by at least 50%, confirming suspicions based on reviews of the bycatch survey procedures, and raising further concerns about the impact of longline fisheries on seabirds.

We developed two generalized linear models to examine effects of four hook treatments, i.e., four combinations of hook type and size (8/0 J-hook, 9/0 J-hook, 16/0 circle hook, and 18/0 circle hook), on: (1) the probability of catching seabirds on a set and (2) the positive catch rate (i.e., number of seabirds per 1000 hooks in longline sets with at least one seabird caught). Results indicated that combinations of hook type and size significantly influenced the probability of catching seabirds in the United States Atlantic pelagic longline fishery. Use of the 8/0 J-hook led to the highest probability of catching a seabird.

Once on the surface, large seabirds such as albatrosses can easily displace smaller species thus gaining access to baited hooks which increases their likelihood of getting caught. This paper evaluates the extent to which diving species (i.e. Procellaria aequinoctialis, Procellaria conspicillata and Puffinus gravis) increase the susceptibility of albatross to bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries. In 48 sets, attacks on baits were quantified. When more than one bird (of the same or different species) tried to attack the same bait this was defined as a multiple attack. There were 384 attacks on baits, of which 260 were made by a single individual and 124 by more than one. Multiple attacks were the largest source of bycatch of albatrosses (22 of 27 albatrosses whose attacks were observed). Of the baits attacked by albatrosses (n=244), 17% were indirectly facilitated by diving medium-sized petrels. Considering only the multiple attacks in which albatrosses participated (n=114), 36% were initiated by these medium-sized petrels. Eleven (41%) of the albatrosses captured, and whose attacks were observed, resulted from a diving medium-sized seabird species first having contacted the terminal tackle. This paper shows that medium-sized petrels, with a strong ability to dive, increase considerably the access to bait, and indirectly, the incidental bycatch of albatrosses. Observations made in the absence of mitigation measures also provide useful information to improve the performance of tori lines. Based on the seabird behaviour, it is recommended that tori lines should have a minimum aerial coverage of 50 m. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd..","Bycatch susceptibility in pelagic longline fisheries: are albatrosses affected by the diving behaviour of medium_sized petrels",0

In this study, we analyze fishing effort and catch data of the Taiwanese distant-water longline tuna fleet - the largest fleet in the Atlantic Ocean. These data collected by fishery observers over a 5-year span include 61 trips involving 6181 observed sets of over 20 million hooks, where 198 seabirds were caught (23 of which were released alive). Most birds were caught in the South Atlantic, with estimated seabird bycatch rates ranging from 0.026 birds per thousand hooks in the southwest Atlantic to 0.063 birds per thousand hooks in the southeast Atlantic. Black-browed, Atlantic yellow-nosed, and wandering albatrosses, as well as spectacled and southern giant petrels, were the most frequently caught species. Seabird bycatch hotspots were identified at 20°-40°S/10°W-15°E and 35°-45°S/45°-55°W.

This paper applied a Productivity and Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) and the concept of ""Potential Biological Removal Level"" (PBR) to assess the relative impact caused by the Uruguayan pelagic longline fishery on several populations. This two-step approach allowed us to obtain an objective view of the relative impact of the Uruguayan pelagic longline fleet on most of the populations or species of albatrosses and petrels with high association with this fishery. Of fifteen species considered, fourteen were finally assessed and a ranking of risk derived. The concept of PBR was applied to the nine most at-risk species. The impact of fishing on populations could not be straightforwardly inferred from their bycatch rates. Results indicate that large albatrosses (Diomedea spp.) and Thalassarche chlororhynchos are more affected than some of the main species caught by the fishery (i.e. Thalassarche melanophrys and Procellaria aequinoctialis). Diomedea exulans from South Georgia is likely to be the population most affected by the Uruguayan fleet.

The Uruguayan fleet within its operation area was responsible for only the 4.3% to 12.5% of the total annual effort deployed by the different fleets during 2004-2008. The combined impact of these fleets could be sufficiently high to account for many of the observed declines in the populations of D. exulans, D. dabbenena and T. chlororhynchos.

In many cases this is due to safety concerns caused by traditional leaded swivels causing serious injuries, and even fatalities, when they fly-back at the crew in the event of line breakage (e.g. from shark bite offs) during line hauling. This paper presents the results of at-sea and on-shore trials to test the safety and operational effectiveness of an alternative line weight (the Safe Lead) which is designed to slide down, or off the line, in the event of a bite-off, significantly reducing danger to the crew from line weights. At-sea trials in South Africa revealed that Safe Leads can reduce the incidence of dangerous fly-backs to very low levels. In at-sea trails, only 4.2% of Safe Lead fly-backs reached the vessel (the remainder fell in the sea) whereas 73.3% of fly-backs by leaded swivels hit the vessel and one hit a crewmen in the head. Simulated bite-off events on shore revealed the degree of slippage (influences whether leads slide but remain on the branch line, or slide off the end of the line) varied as a function of distance from Safe Lead to hook (1-4. m range) and tension on the line (20-120 kg range). All Safe Lead replicates placed within 2. m of the hook slid off the line under all four tension treatments. Under the higher tension categories of 80 kg and 120 kg, 80% of Safe Leads positioned 3. m from the hook position slid off the line after a simulated bite-off (cut-away).

We also added weight to a subset of branch lines, and compared the effects of line weighting and night vs. day setting in combination with bird-scaring lines on bird and fish catch rates. White-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis), a diving seabird, dominated the seabird assemblage; they were the most numerous seabird and they attacked baited hooks and were killed at the highest rates. Secondary attacks - surface foraging albatrosses stealing baits from white-chinned petrels - drove albatross mortality. With hybrid scaring lines deployed, both diving and surface foraging seabirds made fewer attacks (1.5 and 2 times, respectively) within the lines' 100. m aerial extent, where hooks are closest to the surface and birds are most vulnerable to hooking, than with light lines. However, all metrics of comparison between hybrid and light lines were not statistically conclusive, primarily because birds could access baited hooks in areas beyond the protection afforded by bird-scaring lines (aft and to port of their aerial extent). Seabird bycatch rates were 4.6 times higher during daylight hours (2.00 birds/1000 hooks; 52 birds) than at night (0.439 birds/1000 hooks; 28 birds) and night catch rates near the full moon doubled. Bird catch rates were 18 times higher on unweighted branch lines (1.07/1000 hooks; 79 birds) than on weighted branch lines (0.06/1000 hooks; 1 bird) with no detectable effect on fish catch. With respect to streamer lines, our results suggest that in Procellaria petrel dominated systems the aerial extent of bird-scaring lines (of any design) should span the distance that baited hooks are within 10. m of the surface to effectively prevent bird attacks on baits. Overall, results suggest that night setting, adequate branch line weighting, and proper deployment of two bird-scaring lines have the potential to reduce seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries without reducing the catch rates of target fishes. Further development of safe, fast-sinking branch line weighting configurations and bird-scaring lines less prone to tangling on fishing gear is critical to this effort. © 2013.","Reducing seabird bycatch in the South African joint venture tuna fishery using bird_scaring lines, branch line weighting and nighttime setting of hooks",1

Line settings alternated between ST and PT deployments. About 90% of the seabirds attending the vessel were Laysan albatrosses (Phoebastria immutabilis), and most attacks were by this species. Attacks occurred across broad areas from 25 to 200. m of the stern during ST deployments, whereas PT deployment resulted in few attacks within 75. m of the stern. The number of secondary attacks (birds charging for the bait brought to the surface by the bird making the primary attack) was significantly lower during PT than during ST deployment.

Here, we tested for the evidence and consequences of individual heterogeneity on the demography of the wandering albatross, a seabird heavily affected by fisheries bycatch. We found strong evidence for heterogeneity in survival with one group of individuals having a 5.2% lower annual survival probability than another group, and a decrease in the proportion of those individuals with the lowest survival in the population coinciding with a 7.5 fold increase in fishing effort in the foraging areas.

A common approach to quantifying the extent of interactions is to overlay density maps of seabird and fishing activities derived from point locations. Such large-scale evaluations of overlap can be misleading due to the static representation of birds and vessels that in reality are spatially and temporally dynamic. Additionally, overlap at large scales does not necessarily indicate interaction; overlapping distributions of seabirds and fisheries could reflect coincident use of habitat. Using 4 yr of distribution data, we conducted a fine-scale analysis of overlap between albatrosses and fishing vessels. Results were compared to those derived from large-scale density comparisons. Additionally, we compared overlap versus interaction rates by calculating the proportion of time that birds foraged in close association with a fishing vessel versus independently while within 10 km of a vessel. Results of our fine-scale analysis indicated generally low rates of overlap while foraging and high variability among sexes, years and types of fishery. Changes in overlap rates were attributed to shifts in both albatross and vessel distributions. Albatrosses foraged independently of fishing vessels half the time they were within 10 km of a vessel, indicating that 50% of overlap is due to coincident habitat use rather than vessel interaction. Overlaying of large-scale distribution maps failed to distinguish annual variation in the degree of bird-fishery overlap, and suggested overlap where none was identified at the finer scale.

Identification of the principal factors that determine this by-catch and understanding how they could be controlled is fundamental for improving the management of fisheries and so carry out a better conservation of Cory's shearwater populations in the Mediterranean. The aim of this paper was to model the longline by-catch of Mediterranean Cory's shearwater in the Spanish Mediterranean longline fishery as a function of time of the year, technical characteristics of the fishing operation, and geographical location. We used data recorded by an onboard observer program monitoring commercial longline fisheries. During the 10 years covered in this study, 80 birds were captured in 30 fishing operations out of a total of 2,587 observed fishing sets. We used favourability functions and Random Forest analyses to relate the presence of Cory's shearwater in the by-catch with the explanatory factors. The most explanatory factor in relation to incidence of by-catch was the geographical location (longitude and fishing over the continental shelf) and then the technical characteristics of the fishing operation (number of hooks and fishing during non-working days). Our conclusion is clear, because seabirds are more likely to approach longline vessels when trawlers are not allowed to operate (i.e. non-working days), activity of longliners should be limited to working days, and closing longliners activity during the month of October could reduce greatly reducing seabird bycatch. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cory's shearwater by_catch in the Mediterranean Spanish commercial longline fishery: implications for management",0

The Hawaii longline swordfish fishery reduced seabird captures by an order of magnitude primarily through mitigating bycatch during setting. Now, 75% of captures occur during hauling. We fit observer data to a generalized additive regression model with mixed effects to determine the significance of the effect of various factors on the standardized seabird haul catch rate. Density of albatrosses attending vessels during hauling, leader length and year had largest model effects. The standardized haul catch rate significantly increased with increased albatross density during hauling. The standardized catch rate was significantly higher the longer the leader: shorter leaders place weighted swivels closer to hooks, reducing the likelihood of baited hooks becoming available to surface-scavenging albatrosses. There was a significant linear increasing temporal trend in the standardized catch rate, possibly partly due to an observed increasing temporal trend in the local abundance of albatrosses attending vessels during hauling. Swivel weight, Beaufort scale and season were also significant but smaller model effects. Most (81%) haul captures were on branchlines actively being retrieved. Future haul mitigation research should therefore focus on reducing bird access to hooks as crew coil branchlines, including methods identified here of shorter leaders and heavier swivels, and other potentially effective methods, including faster branchline coiling and shielding the area where hooks becomes accessible. The proportion of Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) captures that occurred during hauling was significantly, 1.6 times, higher than for black-footed albatrosses (P. nigripes), perhaps due to differences in the time of day of foraging and in daytime scavenging competitiveness; mitigating haul bycatch would therefore be a larger benefit to Laysans. Locally, findings identify opportunities to nearly eliminate seabird bycatch. Globally, findings fill a gap in knowledge of methods to mitigate seabird bycatch during pelagic longline hauling.","Mitigating Seabird Bycatch during Hauling by Pelagic Longline Vessels",0

Multiple measures were used to compare the performance of weighted vs. unweighted branch lines set with two bird-scaring lines - hybrid lines with long and short streamers - during daytime and nighttime. The weights used were a novel double-weight configuration. Secondary attacks on baits brought to the surface by white-chinned petrels drove albatross mortality. Regardless of time of day, weighted branch lines with two bird-scaring lines, deployed and maintained with an aerial extent of 100. m, reduced bird attacks by a factor of four, and secondary attacks and seabird mortality by a factor of seven, compared to unweighted branch lines, with little effect on fish catch rates and with no injuries to crew. This combination yielded zero bird mortalities when gear was set at night. We conclude that the simultaneous use of two bird-scaring lines, weighted branch lines and night setting meet our criteria for best-practice seabird bycatch mitigation for the joint-venture fleet targeting tuna and related species in the South African EEZ. To be successful, the aerial extent of bird-scaring lines should be aligned with the distance astern that baited hooks sink beyond the foraging depth of the dominant seabird - in this case white-chinned petrels to a depth near 5. m. Given that these measures were successful in one of the most challenging pelagic longline fisheries, they are likely to be widely applicable to pelagic longline fisheries using similar gear. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Best practice seabird bycatch mitigation for pelagic longline fisheries targeting tuna and related species",0

Recent research suggests that fishing effort is increasing worldwide, highlighting the need to evaluate strategies intended to reduce marine megafauna bycatch. Here, we use three focal species (i.e. leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea, black-footed albatross Phoebastria nigripes and vaquita porpoise Phocoena sinus) as case studies to compare management outcomes of four bycatch mitigation measures: time-area closures, individual bycatch limits, gear modifications and buy-outs. Time-area closures were used for leatherbacks and vaquitas with limited effectiveness, although timing, size and enforcement influenced their efficacy. Individual bycatch limits were employed for leatherbacks in one fishery, sometimes simultaneously with gear modifications and closures. Gear modifications consistently reduced bycatch of leatherbacks and black-footed albatross and showed strong promise for vaquitas. True buy-outs were only used for vaquitas and were costly, most fishers were unwilling to be bought out, and it is unclear if they reduced bycatch. Our review suggests that gear modifications were the most widely used and generally most promising technique for these species, although management outcomes of each strategy depended largely on the species-fishery interaction, fishery characteristics and socioeconomic context.

We fill this knowledge gap and present a synoptic global assessment of the distribution and intensity of bycatch of seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles based on empirical data from the three most commonly used types of fishing gears worldwide. We identify taxa-specific hotspots of bycatch intensity and find evidence of cumulative impacts across fishing fleets and gears. This global map of bycatch illustrates where data are particularly scarce-in coastal and small-scale fisheries and ocean regions that support developed industrial fisheries and millions of small-scale fishers-and identifies fishing areas where, given the evidence of cumulative hotspots across gear and taxa, traditional species or gear-specific bycatch management and mitigation efforts may be necessary but not sufficient. Given the global distribution of bycatch and the mitigation success achieved by some fleets, the reduction of air-breathing megafauna bycatch is both an urgent and achievable conservation priority.","Global patterns of marine mammal, seabird, and sea turtle bycatch reveal taxa_specific and cumulative megafauna hotspots",0

Population sizes of each species are estimated at 50-200+ individuals, ranging across an area of approximately 300 km by 250 km, including adjacent areas in Laos and Vietnam. The principal causes of vulture mortality were poisoning (73%), probably as an accidental consequence of local hunting and fishing practices, and hunting or capture for traditional medicine (15%). This represents a significant loss from such a small population of long-lived, slow breeding, species such as vultures. Cambodian vultures are severely food limited and are primarily dependent on domestic ungulate carcasses, as wild ungulate populations have been severely depleted over the past 20 years. Local people across the vulture range still follow traditional animal husbandry practices, including releasing livestock into the open deciduous dipterocarp forest areas when they are not needed for work, providing the food source. Reducing threats through limiting the use of poisons (which are also harmful for human health) and supplementary food provisioning in the short to medium-term through 'vulture restaurants' is critical if Cambodian vultures are to be conserved.

We analysed results of 62 necropsies and 48 NSAID assays of liver and/or kidney for vultures of five species found dead in India between 2000 and 2012. Visceral gout and diclofenac were detected in vultures from nine states and three species: Gyps bengalensis, Gyps indicus and Gyps himalayensis. Visceral gout was found in every vulture carcass in which a measurable level of diclofenac was detected. Meloxicam, an NSAID of low toxicity to vultures, was found in two vultures and nimesulide in five vultures. Nimesulide at elevated tissue concentrations was associated with visceral gout in four of these cases, always without diclofenac, suggesting that nimesulide may have similar toxic effects to those of diclofenac. Residues of meloxicam on its own were never associated with visceral gout. The proportion of Gyps vultures found dead in the wild in India with measurable levels of diclofenac in their tissues showed a modest and non-significant decline since the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac. The prevalence of visceral gout declined less, probably because some cases of visceral gout from 2008 onwards were associated with nimesulide rather than diclofenac. Veterinary use of nimesulide is a potential threat to the recovery of vulture populations.","Continuing mortality of vultures in India associated with illegal veterinary use of diclofenac and a potential threat from nimesulide",0

The manufacture of veterinary formulations of diclofenac has since been banned across the region with mixed success. However, at least 12 other NSAIDs are available for veterinary use in South Asia. Aceclofenac is one of these compounds, and it is known to metabolize into diclofenac in some mammal species. The metabolic pathway of aceclofenac in cattle, the primary food of vultures in South Asia, is unknown. We gave 6 cattle the recommended dose of aceclofenac (2 mg/kg), collected blood thereafter at intervals for up to 12 h, and used liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry in a pharmacokinetic analysis of aceclofenac and diclofenac in the plasma. Nearly all the aceclofenac administered to the cattle was very rapidly metabolized into diclofenac. At 2 h, half the aceclofenac had been converted into diclofenac, and at 12 h four-fifths of the aceclofenac had been converted into diclofenac. Therefore, administering aceclofenac to livestock poses the same risk to vultures as administering diclofenac to livestock. This, coupled with the risk that aceclofenac may replace diclofenac in the veterinary market, points to the need for an immediate ban on all aceclofenac formulations that can be used to treat livestock. Without such a ban, the recovery of vultures across South Asia will not be successful.","Metabolism of aceclofenac in cattle to vulture-killing diclofenac",0

Carprofen residues were highest in cattle kidney (7.72 ± 2.38 mg/kg) and injection site muscle (289.05 ± 98.96 mg/kg of dimension of 5 × 5 × 5 cm). Vultures exposed to carprofen as residues in the kidney tissue or pure drug equivalents showed no toxic signs. When exposed to average injection site concentrations (64 mg/kg) one of two birds died with evidence of severe renal and liver damage. Toxicokinetic analysis revealed a prolonged drug half-life of 37.75 h in the dead bird as opposed to 13.99 ± 5.61 h from healthy birds dosed intravenously at 5 mg/kg. While carprofen may generally be harmless to Gyps vultures, its high levels at the injection site in treated cattle can result in lethal exposure in foraging vultures, due to relative small area of tissue it is found therein. We thus suggest that carprofen not be used in domesticated ungulates in areas where carcasses are accessible or provided to vultures at supplementary feeding sites.","The use of toxicokinetics and exposure studies to show that carprofen in cattle tissue could lead to secondary  toxicity and death in wild vultures",0

In the face of uncertainty and complexity, decision-analytic approaches can be used to identify optimal management options for maximizing captive production. Building decision-analytic models requires iterations of model conception, data analysis, model building and evaluation, identification of remaining uncertainty, further research and monitoring to reduce uncertainty, and integration of new data into the model. We initiated such a process to maximize captive production of the whooping crane (Grus americana), the world's most endangered crane, which is managed through captive breeding and reintroduction. We collected 15 years of captive breeding data from 3 institutions and used Bayesian analysis and model selection to identify predictors of whooping crane hatching success. The strongest predictor, and that with clear management relevance, was incubation environment. The incubation period of whooping crane eggs is split across two environments: crane nests and artificial incubators. Although artificial incubators are useful for allowing breeding pairs to produce multiple clutches, our results indicate that crane incubation is most effective at promoting hatching success. Hatching probability increased the longer an egg spent in a crane nest, from 40% hatching probability for eggs receiving 1 day of crane incubation to 95% for those receiving 30 days (time incubated in each environment varied independently of total incubation period). Because birds will lay fewer eggs when they are incubating longer, a tradeoff exists between the number of clutches produced and egg hatching probability. We developed a decision-analytic model that estimated 16 to be the optimal number of days of crane incubation needed to maximize the number of offspring produced. These results show that using decision-analytic tools to account for uncertainty in captive breeding can improve the rate at which such programs contribute to wildlife reintroductions. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","Decision Analysis for Conservation Breeding: Maximizing Production for Reintroduction of Whooping Cranes",0

Specifically along the Texas Gulf coast, the coupled effects of decreased freshwater inflows to the estuary and natural processes (e. g., precipitation, wind, and tides) can exert significant salt-stress on coastal marsh vegetation. In this project we sought to quantitatively link the inflow of freshwater to the estuary (San Antonio Bay) with Aransas National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) coastal marsh salinity and assess the influence of salinity and inundation on Carolina wolfberry (Lycium carolinianum Walt.) phenology (leaf and fruit abundance). The Carolina wolfberry is one of the more common high marsh plant species found at ANWR and has been shown to be a key food source for endangered Whooping Cranes which inhabit the coastal marshes of the ANWR each fall/winter. Results from our study show that periods of decreased freshwater inflows to the estuary correlated with increased marsh salinity at the ANWR. Wolfberry plants at ANWR marsh sites displayed increased fruit abundance during years which had lower mean summer time salinity (June, July, and August) in San Antonio Bay; conversely, during years of increased bay salinity during the same summertime months, wolfberry plants showed decreased fruit abundance. Through the continued validation of the relationship between inflows and coastal marsh salinity, we hope to provide additional insight into how wolfberry phenology varies inter-annually across both salinity and inundation regimes and how freshwater inflows may affect food availability for the endangered Whooping Crane. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","River inflow, estuarine salinity, and Carolina wolfberry fruit abundance: linking abiotic drivers to Whooping Crane food",0

There has been little attempt to determine how artificial incubation differs from bird-contact incubation. We describe a novel archive (data-logger) egg and use it to compare temperature, humidity, and egg-turning in 5 whooping crane (Grus americana) nests, 4 sandhill crane (G. canadensis) nests, and 3 models of artificial incubator; each of which are used to incubate eggs in whooping crane captivebreeding programs. Mean incubation temperature was 31.78 °C for whooping cranes and 32.838 °C for sandhill cranes. This is well below that of the artificial incubators (which were set based on a protocol of 37.68 °C). Humidity in crane nests varied considerably, but median humidity in all 3 artificial incubators was substantially different from that in the crane nests. Two artificial incubators failed to turn the eggs in a way that mimicked crane egg-turning.

Annual releases of captive-reared juvenile Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) were begun in 1993 in central Florida, USA, to establish a breeding, non-migratory population. Over a 12-year period, 286 birds were released, but by 2004, the introduced flock had produced only four wild-fledged birds. Consequently, releases were halted over managers' concerns about the performance of the released flock and uncertainty about the efficacy of further releases. We used data on marked, released birds to develop predictive models for addressing whether releases should be resumed, and if so, under what schedule. To examine the outcome of different release scenarios, we simulated the survival and productivity of individual female birds under a baseline model that recognized age and breeding-class structure and which incorporated empirically estimated stochastic elements. As data on wild-fledged birds from captive-reared parents were sparse, a key uncertainty that confronts release decision-making is whether captive-reared birds and their offspring share the same vital rates. Therefore, we used data on the only population of wild Whooping Cranes in existence to construct two alternatives to the baseline model. The probability of population persistence was highly sensitive to the choice of these three models. Under the baseline model, extirpation of the population was nearly certain under any scenario of resumed releases. In contrast, the model based on estimates from wild birds projected a high probability of persistence under any release scenario, including cessation of releases. Therefore, belief in either of these models suggests that further releases are an ineffective use of resources. In the third model, which simulated a population Allee effect, population persistence was sensitive to the release decision: high persistence probability was achieved only through the release of more birds, whereas extirpation was highly probable with cessation of releases. Despite substantial investment of time and effort in the release program, evidence collected to date does not favor one model over another; therefore, any decision about further releases must be made under considerable biological uncertainty. However, given an assignment of credibility weight to each model, a best, informed decision about releases can be made under uncertainty. Furthermore, if managers can periodically revisit the release decision and collect monitoring data to further inform the models, then managers have a basis for confronting uncertainty and adaptively managing releases through time. © 2010 Dt.

Climate change predictions suggest overall temperature increases and significant changes in precipitation regimes throughout North America. At the individual level, temperature changes should have neutral to positive effects on thermoregulation and overall energy expenditure throughout the whooping crane's range. In the breeding grounds, earlier snow melt and increasing temperatures should improve food resources. However, increased precipitation and more extreme rainfall events could impact chick survival if rainfall occurs during hatching. Increased precipitation may also alter fire regimes leading to increased woody plant abundance thus reducing nesting habitat quality. During winter, higher temperatures will lead to a northward shifting of the freeze line, which will decrease habitat quality via invasion of black mangrove. Large portions of current winter habitat may be lost if predicted sea level changes occur. Stopover wetland availability during migration may decrease due to drier conditions in the Great Plains.

We estimated age-specific survival and natality, parameterized an age-structured density-dependent model, and projected population sizes assuming two different estimates of wintering ground carrying capacity. Sixty-seven of 132 birds banded between 1977 and 1988 formed nesting pairs, females first produced hatchlings when 3 to 7 yrs old, and the annual proportion of mature females that reproduced successfully ranged from 0.566 to 0.606.

We examined chick mortality for this population and used daily chick survival rates as our response variable to model several parameters including phenology, chick age, energetics and parent age and experience. We also developed and evaluated adoption techniques using sandhill cranes Grus canadensis to mitigate the effects of high chick mortality and increase the probability of fledging. Our results illustrate the challenges that translocated populations can face as they encounter novel breeding conditions. We found that whooping crane daily chick survival was relatively low and most mortality events occurred within the first 20 days. Our results indicated that variables related to age of the parents as well as the pair's previous chick rearing experience were useful for predicting daily chick survival. We found that sandhill crane foster parents readily accepted replacement chicks. We also demonstrated adopted chicks acceptance of foster parents and that the chicks' source (captive-born vs wild-born) did not affect success of the adoption. Chick adoption provides several management options that could be used to bypass the period when chicks experience the greatest mortality.

Despite ongoing development and increases in infrastructure, we have few estimates of the magnitude of collision mortality. We reviewed the existing literature on avian mortality associated with transmission lines and derived an initial estimate for Canada. Estimating mortality from collisions with power lines is challenging due to the lack of studies, especially from sites within Canada, and due to uncertainty about the magnitude of detection biases. Detection of bird collisions with transmission lines varies due to habitat type, species size, and scavenging rates. In addition, birds can be crippled by the impact and subsequently die, although crippling rates are poorly known and rarely incorporated into estimates. We used existing data to derive a range of estimates of avian mortality associated with collisions with transmission lines in Canada by incorporating detection, scavenging, and crippling biases. There are 231,966 km of transmission lines across Canada, mostly in the boreal forest. Mortality estimates ranged from 1 million to 229.5 million birds per year, depending on the bias corrections applied. We consider our most realistic estimate, taking into account variation in risk across Canada, to range from 2.5 million to 25.6 million birds killed per year. Data from multiple studies across Canada and the northern U.S. indicate that the most vulnerable bird groups are (1) waterfowl, (2) grebes, (3) shorebirds, and (4) cranes, which is consistent with other studies. Populations of several groups that are vulnerable to collisions are increasing across Canada (e.g., waterfowl, raptors), which suggests that collision mortality, at current levels, is not limiting population growth. However, there may be impacts on other declining species, such as shorebirds and some species at risk, including Alberta's Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) and western Canada's endangered Whooping Cranes (Grus americana). Collisions may be more common during migration, which underscores the need to understand impacts across the annual cycle.

Veterinary care included preventive measures and comprehensive pre-release evaluations to improve fitness and reduce translocation of potential disease agents to native habitats. A total of 44 clinically normal birds were released (70% of assigned individuals). Cases of morbidity were classified according to primary body system affected. Musculoskeletal disorders were described in 57 birds (90%); five birds were removed from the project prior to release (8%), all for abnormalities that prevented normal function.

Beginning with the development of daily nest survival models, and proceeding through subsequent extensions, the capacity for modeling the effects of hypothesized factors on nest survival has expanded greatly. We extend nest survival models further by introducing an approach to deal with incompletely observed, temporally varying covariates using a hierarchical model. Hierarchical modeling offers a way to separate process and observational components of demographic models to obtain estimates of the parameters of primary interest, and to evaluate structural effects of ecological and management interest. We built a hierarchical model for daily nest survival to analyze nest data from reintroduced whooping cranes (Grus americana) in the Eastern Migratory Population. This reintroduction effort has been beset by poor reproduction, apparently due primarily to nest abandonment by breeding birds. We used the model to assess support for the hypothesis that nest abandonment is caused by harassment from biting insects. We obtained indices of blood-feeding insect populations based on the spatially interpolated counts of insects captured in carbon dioxide traps. However, insect trapping was not conducted daily, and so we had incomplete information on a temporally variable covariate of interest. We therefore supplemented our nest survival model with a parallel model for estimating the values of the missing insect covariates. We used Bayesian model selection to identify the best predictors of daily nest survival. Our results suggest that the black fly Simulium annulus may be negatively affecting nest survival of reintroduced whooping cranes, with decreasing nest survival as abundance of S. annulus increases. The modeling framework we have developed will be applied in the future to a larger data set to evaluate the biting-insect hypothesis and other hypotheses for nesting failure in this reintroduced population; resulting inferences will support ongoing efforts to manage this population via an adaptive management approach. Wider application of our approach offers promise for modeling the effects of other temporally varying, but imperfectly observed covariates on nest survival, including the possibility of modeling temporally varying covariates collected from incubating adults. © 2013 The Authors.

However, a less recognized challenge is that the management objectives are often numerous and complex. Decision makers managing reintroduction efforts are often concerned with more than just how to maximize the probability of reintroduction success from a population perspective. Decision makers are also weighing other concerns such as budget limitations, public support and/or opposition, impacts on the ecosystem, and the need to consider not just a single reintroduction effort, but conservation of the entire species. Multiple objective decision analysis is a powerful tool for formal analysis of such complex decisions. We demonstrate the use of multiple objective decision analysis in the case of the Florida non-migratory whooping crane reintroduction effort. In this case, the State of Florida was considering whether to resume releases of captive-reared crane chicks into the non-migratory whooping crane population in that state. Management objectives under consideration included maximizing the probability of successful population establishment, minimizing costs, maximizing public relations benefits, maximizing the number of birds available for alternative reintroduction efforts, and maximizing learning about the demographic patterns of reintroduced whooping cranes. The State of Florida engaged in a collaborative process with their management partners, first, to evaluate and characterize important uncertainties about system behavior, and next, to formally evaluate the tradeoffs between objectives using the Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique (SMART). The recommendation resulting from this process, to continue releases of cranes at a moderate intensity, was adopted by the State of Florida in late 2008. Although continued releases did not receive support from the International Whooping Crane Recovery Team, this approach does provide a template for the formal, transparent consideration of multiple, potentially competing, objectives in reintroduction decision making. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","A Matter of Tradeoffs: Reintroduction as a Multiple Objective Decision",0

We estimated the probability of the population reaching downlisting criteria. We used Monte Carlo simulation to examine this population's sensitivity to periods of negative growth (i.e., annual growth rate (r) = -0.025, -0.050, -0.100, or -0.150 for 1-3 consecutive years). We found this population exhibiting periodic declines on a 10-year cycle. We show it is unlikely to go extinct assuming conditions remain similar to the past. Our forecasts suggested the population will contain >400 birds by 2025. We found =3 consecutive years of r= -0.1 or =2 consecutive years of r= -0.15 must occur to significantly reduce abundance from the current trajectory and delay recovery.

For long-lived birds with low annual production, adjustment to local breeding conditions can take many years. We examined nest success rates of 2 introduced bird species, whooping crane (Grus americana) and trumpeter swan (Cygnus buccinator), in Wisconsin. Both species are long-lived with low annual reproductive rates. Trumpeter swans were established in our study area approximately 10 years before whooping cranes. We predicted that trumpeter swans would show less sensitivity to environmental stressors. We used daily nest survival rates (DNSRs) as our response variable to model several environmental parameters including weather, phenology, and ornithophilic black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae). Additionally, we examined the influence of captive history, age, release method, energetics, and nesting experience on whooping crane DNSRs. Daily nest survival of whooping cranes was the most sensitive to stressors. Trumpeter swan daily nest survival showed less sensitivity to the same stressors. Daily nest survival for both species peaked later in the nesting season, after 30 April and before 30 May. We also found that the daily nest survival rate (DNSR) for whooping cranes was potentially affected by captive exposure (measured by generations removed from the wild). Our results highlight the difficulties associated with conservation of long-lived birds with low annual productivity as they adjust to local breeding conditions and that nest phenology at the source location can determine how these conditions are interfaced. We recommend that the juxtaposition of source and introduction location nest phenology be considered prior to introduction site selection. Additionally, strategically selecting offspring from captive pairs with nest phenology similar to that of sympatric species at the introduction location should be considered. Published 2013.

Techniques included leading juveniles from Wisconsin to wintering areas by ultralight aircraft or direct release of juveniles in Wisconsin prior to their first autumn migration. With few exceptions, ultralight-led cranes released on the Florida Gulf Coast wintered in inland freshwater habitats in subsequent winters. Wintering of the population occurred in four general regions: Florida-southern Georgia, coastal Carolina, the Mid-South (primarily Tennessee and northern Alabama), and the North (Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky). Releases of ultralight-led juveniles resulted in the majority of the population returning to winter in Florida during the early years of the reintroduction. Later direct autumn releases and shortstopping by ultralight-led birds increased numbers in the Mid-South. Winter climate played a large role in wintering in the North. Drought resulted in changes in wintering locations, especially in Florida. Other factors influencing changes in distribution included habitat degradation and associations with other whooping cranes, especially new mates and birds released by different techniques. Breeding pairs and direct autumn-released birds exhibited greater winter site fidelity than did nonbreeders or ultralight aircraft-led birds, but fidelity was low for all groups. Causes of mortality differed across the winter range, with predation being most prevalent in Florida and gunshot accounting for the majority of mortalities north of Florida. Because most pairing occurred in central Wisconsin, the widespread winter distribution had no apparent negative effect on pair formation. There was no clear relationship between winter region and subsequent incubation success. The widespread distribution of the population poses minimal risk to the outcome of the reintroduction in comparison to reproduction problems in the core reintroduction area of central Wisconsin.","Winter Distribution Dynamics and Implications to a Reintroduced Population of Migratory Whooping Cranes",0

Therefore, we examined relationships between population demographics and winter drought (1950-2011) for endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) wintering in Texas, USA. We modeled winter loss and its contribution to annual mortality as functions of winter drought, determined recruitment needed to maintain population growth after drought, and identified which demographic parameters underpin this population's growth. Previous research assumed winter loss (i.e., birds missed in subsequent surveys) represented mortality. We show that loss includes temporary emigration to upland habitats, early migration, and incomplete detection. Despite this, we maintained this assumption to evaluate the relevance of winter mortality to population growth. We found that winter loss (ß^=-0.308, SE = 0.042) and its contribution to annual mortality (ß^=-0.318, SE = 0.047) increased with drought severity (Palmer hydrological drought index; PHDI). Given average recruitment (0.145, SD = 0.090), this population increases 1.2% (95% CI = -2.9% to 4.2%) after extreme drought (PHDI = -4). No recruitment must occur for 3. years with moderate to severe drought (PHDI < -2.5) to delay species' recovery ˜7. years. This scenario has not occurred since population monitoring began in 1938. Of the demographic parameters we examined, winter loss explained population growth least (14.4%; 95% CI = 3.6-35.8%), and it was partially compensatory. Breeding-migratory mortality explained 42.2% (95% CI = 19.1-61.5%) of population growth and recruitment 49.9% (95% CI = 20.6-75.2%). Our results focus conservation on breeding and migratory periods, and deemphasize winter mortality and drought. On the wintering grounds, conservation of whooping cranes should emphasize maintaining coastal, upland, and interior habitats for this population.","Whooping crane demographic responses to winter drought focus conservation strategies",0

In cases where a species has been extirpated from a region for decades, however, this task is fraught with uncertainty. Uncertainty can be minimized and adjusted for by monitoring and adaptive management. The central goal of this study was to identify reintroduction sites that facilitate dispersion of whooping cranes (Grus americana), a federally listed endangered species, into optimal habitat as quickly as possible. First, we described the habitat selection of breeding home ranges for reintroduced whooping cranes in and around Necedah National Wildlife Refuge of central Wisconsin. We defined home ranges as 95% fixed spatial kernel density estimates from location data gathered from nesting whooping cranes from April through July 2005-2010. Whooping crane home ranges contained more emergent herbaceous wetlands than expected by chance and less developed or barren land, forest, and scrubland. Breeding whooping crane home ranges usually were composed of distinct nesting territories and off-territory elements; when moving off-territory, cranes decreased wetland selection and increased selection for open uplands. Second, we used habitat composition values and strength of selection (as determined by Jacob's index) to create a habitat suitability map to identify potential habitats that breeding whooping cranes could use in unoccupied eastern Wisconsin. With this method, we identified 2 large suitable wetland complexes within our study area associated with the Fox and Rock Rivers. Based on this analysis, the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership began releasing whooping cranes into White River Marsh State Wildlife Area and Horicon National Wildlife Refuge in 2011.","Refining Reintroduction of Whooping Cranes with Habitat Use and Suitability Analysis",0
"Williams_526","Williams",526,2014,"10.1890/13-0559.1","Ecological Applications","The reintroduction of threatened and endangered species is now a common method for reestablishing populations. Typically, a fundamental objective of reintroduction is to establish a self-sustaining population. Estimation of demographic parameters in reintroduced populations is critical, as these estimates serve multiple purposes. First, they support evaluation of progress toward the fundamental objective via construction of population viability analyses (PVAs) to predict metrics such as probability of persistence. Second, PVAs can be expanded to support evaluation of management actions, via management modeling. Third, the estimates themselves can support evaluation of the demographic performance of the reintroduced population (e.g., via comparison with wild populations). For each of these purposes, thorough treatment of uncertainties in the estimates is critical. Recently developed statistical methods (namely, hierarchical Bayesian implementations of state-space models) allow for effective integration of different types of uncertainty in estimation. We undertook a demographic estimation effort for a reintroduced population of endangered Whooping Cranes with the purpose of ultimately developing a Bayesian PVA for determining progress toward establishing a self-sustaining population, and for evaluating potential management actions via a Bayesian PVA-based management model. We evaluated individual and temporal variation in demographic parameters based upon a multi-state, mark-recapture model. We found that survival was relatively high across time and varied little by sex. There was some indication that survival varied by release method. Survival was similar to that observed in the wild population. Although overall reproduction in this reintroduced population is poor, birds formed social pairs when relatively young, and once a bird was in a social pair, it had a nearly 50% chance of nesting the following breeding season. Also, once a bird had nested, it had a high probability of nesting again. These results are encouraging, considering that survival and reproduction have been major challenges in past reintroductions of this species. The demographic estimates developed will support construction of a management model designed to facilitate exploration of management actions of interest, and will provide critical guidance in future planning for this reintroduction.

We then used this information to identify areas for potential wind power development in a U.S. state within the flyway (Nebraska) that minimize conflicts between Whooping Crane stopover habitat and the development of clean, renewable energy sources. Up to 54% of our study area was predicted to be unsuitable as Whooping Crane stopover habitat and could be considered relatively low risk for conflicts between Whooping Cranes and wind energy development.

Bridging ties between community and state, federal, academic, and nonprofit organizations offer opportunities for knowledge sharing and legitimacy. Reciprocity and trust were evident from descriptions of the community working together effectively to address environmental and crane-related concerns. Challenges to successful community involvement include finding ways for meaningful community contributions to foster greater trust between the community and federal natural resource managers.

We developed a species distribution model (SDM) that could be used to inform habitat management actions for Whooping Cranes within the state of Nebraska (U.S.A.). We collated 407 opportunistic Whooping Crane group records reported from 1988 to 2012. Most records of Whooping Cranes were contributed by the public; therefore, developing an SDM that accounted for sampling bias was essential because observations at some migration stopover locations may be under represented. An auxiliary data set, required to explore the influence of sampling bias, was derived with expert elicitation. Using our SDM, we compared an intensively managed area in the Central Platte River Valley with the Niobrara National Scenic River in northern Nebraska. Our results suggest, during the peak of migration, Whooping Crane abundance was 262.2 (90% CI 40.2-3144.2) times higher per unit area in the Central Platte River Valley relative to the Niobrara National Scenic River. Although we compared only 2 areas, our model could be used to evaluate any region within the state of Nebraska.

Recently introduced, captively reared whooping cranes have had periods of poor reproductive performance in central Wisconsin that sometimes coincided with black fly (Diptera: Simuliidae) emergences. Sandhill crane Grus canadensis reproductive performance in central Wisconsin is approximately double that of whooping cranes. We used comfort behaviors as a measure of black fly harassment to infer whether behavioral differences existed between nesting sandhill cranes and nesting whooping cranes and between successful and unsuccessful whooping crane pairs. To further explore the interaction between black flies and incubating whooping cranes, we examined differences in behaviors between incubating birds and their off-nest mates. Compared to their off-nest mates, incubating whooping cranes exhibited elevated comfort behaviors, suggesting a bird at a nest may experience greater harassment from black flies. Sandhill cranes had elevated head-flicks over whooping cranes. Whooping cranes exhibited more headrubs than sandhill cranes, and successful whooping crane pairs had elevated head-rubs over pairs that deserted their nests. Behavioral differences between sandhill cranes and whooping cranes as well as differences in reproductive performance, could be explained by exposure to local breeding conditions. Whereas sandhill cranes have nested in the area for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, whooping cranes were only recently introduced to the area. Behavioral differences between the species as well as those between successful and unsuccessful whooping crane pairs could also be explained by the effect of captive exposure, which could affect all whooping crane introductions.","Host-Parasite Behavioral Interactions in a Recently Introduced, Whooping Crane Population",1

Management decisions in this context must be made in the face of uncertainty, often with limited capacity to collect information. Adaptive management (AM) combines management and monitoring, with the aim of updating knowledge and improving decision-making over time. We provide a guide for managers who may realize the potential of AM, but are unsure where to start. The urgent need for iterative management decisions, the existence of uncertainty, and the opportunity for learning offered by often highly-controlled captive environments create favorable conditions for AM. However, experiments and monitoring may be complicated by small sample sizes, and the ability to control the system, including stochasticity and observability, may be limited toward the wild end of the spectrum. We illustrate the key steps to implementing AM in threatened species management using four case studies, including the management of captive programs for cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and whooping cranes (Grus americana), of a translocation protocol for Arizona cliffroses Purshia subintegra and of ongoing supplementary feeding of reintroduced hihi (Notiomystis cincta) populations. For each case study, we explain (1) how to clarify whether the decision can be improved by learning (i.e. it is iterative and complicated by uncertainty) and what the management objectives are; (2) how to articulate uncertainty via alternative, testable hypotheses such as competing models or parameter distributions; (3) how to formally define how additional information can be collected and incorporated in future management decisions.","Adaptive management for improving species conservation across the captive-wild spectrum",0

We developed an integrated population model to study the dynamics of the only remnant population of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) in North America, 1977-2013. Despite much conservation attention for this species, there has been little study on temporal variability in demography and how that variation contributes to population dynamics. Demographic rates were most variable for fledge rate and survival of the youngest age classes while adult survival was less variable. Population growth was influenced mainly by variation in fledge rate, breeding propensity and survival of hatch year and second year cranes while survival of older age classes had less influence. Fledge rates were correlated to the boreal snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus)-Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) cycle and were lowest 2 years after increases in lynx population growth. In terms of management, mean annual fledge rates were similar between years with and without egg collection for captive rearing (0.523 vs 0.518), suggesting no influence of this practice on population-level productivity. Our findings add to the growing body of results showing that while population growth may be most sensitive to changes in adult survival in long-lived vertebrates, variation in breeding parameters often drives annual fluctuations in abundance. Maintaining adult whooping crane survival at currently high rates and increasing breeding output where possible may be effective management strategies for achieving conservation goals.","Integrated population modeling to assess demographic variation and contributions to population growth for endangered whooping cranes",0

We examined the influence of a range of hydrologic and physical metrics on total unvegetated channel width (TUCW) and maximum unobstructed channel width (MUOCW) during the period of 2007–2015 and applied those findings to assess the performance of the Flow-Sediment-Mechanical management strategy for creating and maintaining whooping crane roosting habitat.

Since 2001, reintroduction of a migratory population of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) has been under way in eastern North America. Hatching success, however, has been extremely low. In our study area, in and near Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in central Wisconsin, USA, we simultaneously tested 3 hypotheses explaining poor hatching success: harassment of incubating birds by black flies (Simuliidae), effects of captivity, and inexperience of breeders. When black flies were experimentally suppressed, hatching probability doubled. Daily nest survival for Whooping Cranes was strongly and negatively related to an index of black fly abundance, particularly of Simulium annulus. Daily nest survival was negatively but only weakly related to the number of generations that ancestors of breeding Whooping Cranes had been in captivity and was not related to nesting experience. We also examined whether Whooping Cranes were nesting later to avoid stress from black flies. Phenology shifted earlier with more growing degree days and greater nesting experience and was only weakly related to year. Overall, improved hatching success did not lead to better reproductive success. Although effects of black flies on hatching success can be mitigated through management, such actions would not be adequate to generate satisfactory population growth.

Our intent was to provide a science-driven approach for determining the effects of blood-feeding arthropods on endangered vertebrates and identifying optimal management actions for managers faced with competing objectives. A multiyear experiment demonstrated that black flies reduce nest success in cranes by driving incubating birds off their nests. We used a decision-analytic approach to develop creative management alternatives and evaluate trade-offs among competing objectives. We identified 4 management objectives: establish a self-sustaining crane population, improve crane well-being, maintain native black flies as functional components of the ecosystem, and minimize costs. We next identified potential management alternatives: do nothing, suppress black flies, force crane renesting to occur after the activity period of black flies, relocate releases of cranes, suppress black flies and relocate releases, or force crane renesting and relocate releases. We then developed predictions on constructed scales of 0 (worst-performing alternative) to 1 (best-performing alternative) to indicate how alternative actions performed in terms of management objectives. The optimal action depended on the relative importance of each objective to a decision maker. Only relocating releases was a dominated alternative, indicating that it was not optimal regardless of the relative importance of objectives. A rational decision maker could choose any other management alternative we considered. Recognizing that decisions involve trade-offs that must be weighed by decision makers is crucial to identifying alternatives that best balance multiple management objectives.

We constructed 5 sets of generalized linear mixed-models, with a Bernoulli-distributed response variable (fertile or infertile), to address the effects of egg-specific variables (month laid, sequence, and clutch order of the egg), life-history events of the male and female (age, rearing method, wing condition, age at first pairing, age at current pairing, and female age at first laying), pair-specific characteristics (kinship, years paired, chick-rearing experience, and previous pairings), and captive management decisions (inclusion in the artificial insemination program and pair experience chick-rearing) on the probability of egg fertility. Our results indicate that female-specific factors (especially age, age at current pairing, and wing status) and pair-specific factors of kinship, chick-rearing experience, copulation, and inclusion in the artificial insemination program influenced fertile egg production. Specifically, the younger a female is when paired with her current social mate, the higher probability that her eggs will be fertile. Furthermore, high kinship reduced fertility, whereas chick-rearing experience and artificial insemination of females with a donor male other than her social mate increased fertility. Further research on mate selection and reproductive mechanisms is needed to better understand egg laying and egg fertility in the whooping crane. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.","Factors affecting captive whooping crane egg fertility: A retrospective analysis",1

However, the long-term demographic and genetic effects associated with releasing captive-born individuals with varied life histories into the wild remain largely unknown. To address this question, we developed forward-time, agent-based models for 4 species with long-running captive-breeding and release programs: coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia), western toad (Anaxyrus boreas), and Whooping Crane (Grus americana). We measured the effects of supplementation by comparing population size and neutral genetic diversity in supplemented populations to the same characteristics in unaltered populations 100 years after supplementation ended. Releasing even slightly less fit captive-born individuals to supplement wild populations typically resulted in reductions in population sizes and genetic diversity over the long term when the fitness reductions were heritable (i.e., due to genetic adaptation to captivity) and populations continued to be regulated by density-dependent mechanisms over time. Negative effects for species with longer life spans and lower rates of population replacement were smaller than for species with shorter life spans and higher rates of population replacement. Programs that released captive-born individuals over fewer years or that avoided breeding individuals with captive ancestry had smaller reductions in population size and genetic diversity over the long term. Relying on selection in the wild to remove individuals with reduced fitness mitigated some negative demographic effects, but at a substantial cost to neutral genetic diversity. Our results suggest that conservation-focused captive-breeding programs should take measures to prevent even small amounts of genetic adaptation to captivity, quantitatively determine the minimum number of captive-born individuals to release each year, and fully account for the interactions among genetic adaptation to captivity, population regulation, and life-history variation.","Long-term demographic and genetic effects of releasing captive-born individuals into the wild",0

Whooping cranes primarily roost in shallow surface water wetlands, ponds, and rivers. All these features have been greatly impacted by human activities, which present threats to the continued recovery of the species. A portion of one such river, the central Platte River, has been identified as critical habitat for the survival of the endangered whooping crane. Management intervention is now underway to rehabilitate habitat form and function on the central Platte River to increase use and thereby contribute to the survival of whooping cranes. The goal of our analyses was to develop habitat selection models that could be used to direct riverine habitat management activities (i.e., channel widening, tree removal, flow augmentation, etc.) along the central Platte River and throughout the species’ range. As such, we focused our analyses on two robust sets of whooping crane observations and habitat metrics the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program (Program or PRRIP) and other such organizations could influence. This included channel characteristics such as total channel width, the width of channel unobstructed by dense vegetation, and distance of forest from the edge of the channel and flow-related metrics like wetted width and unit discharge (flow volume per linear meter of wetted channel width) that could be influenced by flow augmentation or reductions during migration. We used 17 years of systematic monitoring data in a discrete-choice framework to evaluate the influence these various metrics have on the relative probability of whooping crane use and found the width of channel unobstructed by dense vegetation and distance to the nearest forest were the best predictors of whooping crane use. Secondly, we used telemetry data obtained from a sample of 38 birds of all ages over the course of seven years, 2010–2016, to evaluate whooping crane use of riverine habitat within the North-central Great Plains, USA. For this second analysis, we focused on the two metrics found to be important predictors of whooping crane use along the central Platte River, unobstructed channel width and distance to nearest forest or wooded area. Our findings indicate resource managers, such as the Program, have the potential to influence whooping crane use of the central Platte River through removal of in-channel vegetation to increase the unobstructed width of narrow channels and through removal of trees along the bank line to increase unforested corridor widths. Results of both analyses also indicated that increases in relative probability of use by whooping cranes did not appreciably increase with unobstructed views 200 m wide and unforested corridor widths that were 330 m. Therefore, managing riverine sites for channels widths >200 m and removing trees beyond 165 m from the channel’s edge would increase costs associated with implementing management actions such as channel and bank-line disking, removing trees, augmenting flow, etc. without necessarily realizing an additional appreciable increase in use by migrating whooping cranes.","Whooping crane use of riverine stopover sites",1

We investigated the behavior of reintroduced whooping cranes (Grus americana) trained to migrate using two different methods to see whether their migration behavior remained different or converged over time. We found that the behavior of the two groups converged relatively rapidly, indicating that early life training may not produce lasting effects, especially in species that display lifelong learning and behavioral adaptation.

Physiological responses to stress can compromise growth and reproduction, increase susceptibility to infection and lead to deleterious effects on health and conservation efforts. However, physiological measures of energetic stress in association with habitat disturbance are uncommon, especially for wild primate species. Here, we report differences in the stress hormone cortisol in two subpopulations of wild gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) inhabiting disturbed and undisturbed forest areas of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Cortisol levels were assessed via opportunistically and noninvasively collected urine samples using previously validated methods. We hypothesized that mangabeys in disturbed forest (DF) areas would experience greater stress and therefore exhibit higher average cortisol levels than conspecifics in nearby relatively undisturbed forest areas (UF). As predicted, mangabeys in the disturbed area had significantly higher cortisol levels (unpaired t-test of log transformed data, t=4.88, d.f.=108, P<0.0001). Mangabeys in undisturbed forest exhibited expected diurnal patterns of cortisol excretion while those in disturbed areas did not, suggesting alteration of the circadian pattern of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function (DF, r=0.12, P=0.43; UF, r=0.35, P=0.005).

Predictors of success such as habitat quality of the release site and number of individuals released have been identified, but the dynamics of successful translocations remain poorly understood. In particular, little is known about the relationship of individual post-release movements to population establishment. In 2004, Laysan teal Anas laysanensis were reintroduced by translocating 20 wild birds from Laysan Island to Midway Atoll. Twenty-two additional wild founders were brought the next year. We monitored the survival, reproductive success and movements of the 42 translocated individuals and their offspring for 4 years. Additionally, we monitored population size from 2004 to 2010. Unlike most translocations, we did not observe elevated post-release mortality despite flight-feather trimming to prevent immediate dispersal off-island: first year survival was >90% and survival rates until 2009 were 0.65±0.08 for founding adults. Laysan teal flew between the two main islands of Midway Atoll, and offspring had significantly larger maximum movement distances than founders. We monitored 84 nests and observed a significant, negative relationship of home range size to productivity for founding females. Flightless founders did not show fidelity to their release sites, but had strong fidelity to annual home ranges after attaining flight. Although we observed a component Allee effect on mate-finding, this did not translate into a demographic Allee effect, and generally, the high fitness of founders contributed substantially to successful population establishment. Laysan teal abundance increased linearly until 2009, but showed evidence of population regulation afterwards. The population estimate was 473 (95% confidence interval 439-508) in 2010. On the much larger main Hawaiian Islands, we expect greater post-release movement, a stronger component Allee effect, lower survival and lower reproductive rates because of predation to preclude successful reintroductions of this species to sites without predator management. © 2012 The Authors.

However, because of limited evaluation of existing data, actions may be prescribed without evidence of producing a beneficial conservation outcome. We analysed empirical data, collected over 23 years across southern Australia, on the impact of fox baiting on malleefowl to determine its effectiveness. We employed data from extensive monitoring surveys to evaluate the observed relationships between investment in fox control, fox baiting intensity, fox presence and two alternative measures of the malleefowl's response: the number of breeding pairs and population growth. This study is the first to quantify the return on investment from fox control in a conservation context. We discovered there is limited quantitative evidence for a benefit of fox baiting on malleefowl, despite it being the main management action implemented for this nationally threatened, well-studied and iconic species. We found that fox baiting did not significantly decrease the presence of foxes and fox presence was positively correlated with malleefowl conservation. Malleefowl breeding population size increased with investment in baiting, although this relationship depended on the number of years the site had been baited. Nonetheless, most sites had a negative relationship between investment and breeding population. In contrast, malleefowl population growth did not benefit from baiting, suggesting that fox baiting is generally not a cost-effective management action for the conservation of this species. This study provides a powerful example of why management decisions should be based on evidence, rather than ecological intuition. Even though the malleefowl is one of the best-monitored species of conservation concern in Australia, we are still uncertain how to cost-effectively manage this species.

Unfortunately, identifying local conservation priorities requires high-resolution data on species distribution, and these are often unavailable. Atlases of species distribution provide data for several groups of organisms in many different areas but are often too coarse in resolution to provide valuable information. We explored the possibility of cross-scale modelling species distributions and we clarified, for the first time, its effect on prioritization exercises. We used different modelling techniques for scaling down atlas data for Sardinian reptiles, validated the outcomes with detailed, field-sampled data, and compared conservation priorities deriving from atlas maps and downscaled models. Doing this, we obtained as a further result the identification of priority species and areas for future conservation strategies. Our results encourage us to experiment further with this approach. Through the downscaling procedure, we obtain high-resolution models with strong variations in predictive performances, although most of the models show satisfactory/excellent scores. This testifies that low-resolution data can be downscaled maintaining low rates of omission and commission errors. Increasing the resolution of distribution maps used for prioritization influences the spatial patterns of priority but does not modify the evaluation of species representation. Overall, we show that atlases can meet the large demand for distribution data by decision makers if appropriate downscaling procedures are adopted.

In particular, fire is known to affect patterns of bird diversity in tropical forests, but we have little understanding of the consequences of this for the functional diversity of bird assemblages. For example, frequent fires could act as an environmental filter selecting species with similar traits and, thus, producing a functional clustering pattern. Here, we used body mass, and dietary and foraging traits to calculate the functional structure of understorey bird assemblages in Amazonian forests analysed 3 years after they had passed under three disturbance levels within the 1997-1998 El-Niño period: unburned, burned once and burned twice. First, we tested whether observed levels of functional diversity were different among these forests and also from what one would expect by chance. Then, we investigated if habitat structure was able to predict changes in the functional structure of the studied bird assemblages. In general, there was no evidence of fire reducing functional diversity nor selecting species functionally more similar than expected by chance. Therefore, bird functional diversity was not different from random in unburned and burned forests. This provides some evidence in favour of high functional redundancy of bird species in the tropics, but also indicates that neutral theories of biodiversity, where processes such as dispersal and survival are more important than biological traits to community assembly, may apply to the assemblages studied. Also, we showed that bird assemblages from forests disturbed by wildfires have the tendency to be functionally overdispersed whereas assemblages from pristine forests tend to be functionally clustered. Thus, environmental structure, in part driven by forest responses to fire, is more important than simple categorical definitions of burn frequency for explaining trait-based assembly rules of understorey birds in the Amazon forest. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.","Bird functional diversity and wildfires in the Amazon: the role of   forest structure",1

However, this assumption is rarely explicitly tested. Here, we test whether four fish species are potential indicators of overall fish diversity in the Bear River drainage (UT and WY, USA). We then examine whether biodiversity indicator relationships are driven by shared habitat associations among species by examining species-habitat models. We use these models to test for correlations between indicator species and common co-occurring species in predicted occurrence and density. Fish diversity was higher at sites with potential indicators than sites without, indicating that conservation aimed at any of these species is likely to affect a broad number of co-occurring taxa. However, with minor exceptions, habitat correlations were inconsistent between indicator and co-occurring species. Instead, most species showed idiosyncratic habitat relationships. Thus, while conservation of habitats containing indicator species is likely to positively affect the distribution of a minority of co-occurring taxa, they may have neutral (or even negative) effects on the distribution or abundance of a majority of other native taxa that are common to the region.

We examined whether the population history or contemporary habitat constraints of this large and mobile carnivore could have significantly affected its genetic structure. We recorded nine mtDNA haplotypes, including five not previously reported. Lynx from Latvia and Estonia had the highest variability with haplotype and nucleotide diversities of 0.81-0.88% and 0.44-0.47%, respectively.

In this study, we forecasted the effects of sea level rise (SLR) on two salt marsh specialist bird species: clapper rails Rallus crepitans and seaside sparrows Ammodramus maritimus. We sampled the abundance of these two species in salt marshes throughout the Georgia, USA, coast in 2013–2014, and analyzed count data using a Bayesian N-mixture model. Model predictions were applied to an SLR land cover model to determine distribution shifts over 100 years. Both species distributions were most sensitive to the relative elevation gradient, with clapper rails using lower elevation marshes and seaside sparrows using higher elevation marshes. These disparities in habitat use, along with other differences according to marsh salinity and distance to forested areas, led to divergent responses to SLR. Clapper rail habitat is predicted to increase with SLR by 52%, but seaside sparrow habitat will contract by 81% by the year 2100. Seaside sparrow habitat is not predicted to decline until sometime between 2025 and 2050, at which point the decline will rapidly accelerate, indicating the importance of careful monitoring in future decades.

In this study, we investigated the repeatability of risk assessments made under the IUCN Red List guidelines for assessment at the national level. Specifically, we assessed the national threat status of breeding and non-breeding populations of Anatidae in Iran using population and distribution data. The variable quality of these data led to uncertainties in decision-making.

For the breeding populations, 78% of the species were categorized as Data Deficient. Of those species in data-sufficient categories, 67% were classified as threatened. We conclude that effective use of the IUCN categories and criteria at the national level is hampered in situations where monitoring schemes have a short history.

Comparisons of biodiversity models with independently collected field data can help us understand the local factors that mediate broad-scale responses. We collected independent bird occurrence and abundance data along two elevational transects in Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania and the Taita Hills, Kenya. We estimated the local response to land use and compared our estimates with modelled local responses based on a large database of many different taxa across Africa. To identify the local factors mediating responses to land use, we compared environmental and species assemblage information between sites in the independent and African-wide datasets. Bird species richness and abundance responses to land use in the independent data followed similar trends as suggested by the African-wide biodiversity model, however the land-use classification was too coarse to capture fully the variability introduced by local agricultural management practices. A comparison of assemblage characteristics showed that the sites on Kilimanjaro and the Taita Hills had higher proportions of forest specialists in croplands compared to the Africa-wide average. Local human population density, forest cover and vegetation greenness also differed significantly between the independent and Africa-wide datasets. Biodiversity models including those variables performed better, particularly in croplands, but still could not accurately predict the magnitude of local species responses to most land uses, probably because local features of the land management are still missed.

Using a study site where wild dogs outnumbered lions for several years prior to lion population recovery, we aimed to investigate whether or not, and by which means, wild dog populations are regulated and influenced by lions. We used 38 pack-years of demographic and behavioural data across two 4-year periods where lion density differed 20-fold (pre-lion era: 1996–1999 and lion era: 2010–2013) to assess how lions may affect wild dog pack size and age structure, litter size and pup survival (n = 329 pups), as well as den site selection (n = 46 dens). Pack size was significantly greater during the pre-lion era. The pup to adult ratio was lower during the lion era and the change in pack composition was directly attributable to significantly greater lion-induced pup mortality.

We measured grain deposition from 2012 to 2015 at 19 sites and assessed the performance of three structures developed to measure spilled grain. We then modeled grain deposition with respect to four types of spatial and temporal variables: those related to grain shipment, physical habitat characteristic, train-related characteristics and variables specific to the study site.

Much of this energy will not be accessible or available to bears; however, their attraction to it could contribute to rising and unsustainable rates of mortality.

We also compared overlaps between the outputs generated by the SDM and layers representing important human threats (fishing intensity, ship density, plastic and oil pollution, ocean acidification), and calculated loss in conservation value using fishing and ship density as cost layers. The key marine areas were located on the southern Patagonian Shelf, overlapping extensively with areas of high fishing activity, and did not change seasonally, while seasonal areas were located off south and southeast Brazil and overlapped with areas of high plastic pollution and ocean acidification. Non-seasonal key areas were located off northeast Brazil on an area of high biodiversity, and with relatively low human impacts.

A conservation status assessment based on 17 years of field studies directed to record habitat decline indicates that five species of seasonal killifish, Leptolebias marmoratus, Nematolebias papilliferus, Notholebias cruzi, Notholebias fractifasciatus and Ophthalmolebias constanciae, distributed among three areas of endemism, are on the edge of survival. Conservation priority, focusing on five remnant isolated locations where those species occur, was evaluated on the basis of the phylogenetic diversity content of each location established through a phylogenetic base containing data on relationships of 118 cynolebiasine species, including all species endemic to Rio. Data on species diversity for each area and data on morphological uniqueness were subsequently compared and discussed. The Barra de São João pool, in the São João-Cabo Frio area, habitat of Nematolebias whitei, No. cruzi, O. constanciae, concentrates the highest value for conservation proposal, followed by the Inoã pool, in the Maricá area, habitat of Ne. papilliferus and No. fractifasciatus. However, in case of the Barra de São João pool being effectively preserved, it is recommended to concentrate efforts to preserve the Cava swamp as a second priority, since although the latter location showing the lowest individual value, Cava swamp and Barra de São João pool together sum a higher phylogenetic diversity index by preserving more distinct cynolebiasine lineages. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Delimiting priorities while biodiversity is lost: Rio's seasonal   killifishes on the edge of survival",0

Therefore, threatened species lists are a powerful tool for conservation planning and prioritization. Our objective is to compare the global, the national and state red lists of amphibians in Brazil. Threatened species were categorized according to their listing in one or several of these lists. We analyzed for true inconsistencies across lists in order to evaluate practical consequences of such incongruences on amphibian conservation in Brazil. We recorded a total of 61 threatened amphibian species in Brazil (across all red lists). Only one species, Phrynomedusa fimbriata, was listed as Extinct (both in IUCN, Brazil and São Paulo lists). A total of eleven endemic species are listed as threatened by the global red list, but do not appear in Brazil's national red list, which represent an inconsistence among these lists. Besides that, the threat category of Thoropa lutzi and Thoropa petropolitana, two endemic species, differ among both lists, which also represents a problem between both lists. These mismatches may be due to several reasons such as different interpretation of the criteria; different methodologies used; different data availability on species; differences in the dates of assessments processes; the assessors' attitudes to uncertainty; outdated red lists. Harmonization among red lists permits a better picture of threatened amphibian diversity across scales and to develop global, national and state plans to complement conservation actions in order to maximize the chance of success of these initiatives. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","A comparative analysis of global, national, and state red lists for   threatened amphibians in Brazil",1

We investigated the impact of bark beetle attacks and subsequent salvage logging on insectivorous bats in a temperate mountain forest. We quantified bat activity (25,373 min counts; 32 plots) using batcorders during 221 all-night surveys in stands killed by bark beetles, with dead trees removed or not, and in vital, single- or multi-layered mature forest stands. We analysed the differences in activity of all bats in general and of bats of foraging guilds (open habitat, forest edge, closed habitat) in these habitats using a generalized linear Poisson mixed model, with plot and observation as random factors, and temperature and habitat as fixed factors. Only open-habitat foragers were slightly more active in salvage-logged stands than in bark-beetle-affected stands; they generally benefited from an open forest canopy, whereas closed-habitat foragers did not. Our results indicated that: (1) bats are less affected by salvage logging after a disturbance of a magnitude typical for European forests, probably because enough roosts are present in surrounding areas, (2) habitats for open foragers are improved by bark beetle infestation and (3) bats are poor bioindicators of negative impacts of salvage logging after natural disturbance in forests with a composition typical for Central Europe. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","The effect of bark beetle infestation and salvage logging on bat   activity in a national park",0

The wildlife trade is driven chiefly by consumer demand, largely in developed nations (but increasingly in Asia), and more species are traded to meet international demand for pets than for any other purpose. We surveyed traders of amphibians and reptiles in the Indonesian provinces of Maluku, West Papua and Papua between September 2010 and April 2011. We recorded 5,370 individuals representing 52 species collected solely for the pet trade. At least 44 % were either fully protected or had not been allocated a harvest quota, making their harvest and trade illegal. Approximately half were listed within the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Trade operates via a complex chain, with hunters receiving little income compared to middlemen and exporters. Examination of Indonesian harvest quotas for amphibians and reptiles suggests limited knowledge of species distributions, with quotas often set for species in provinces where they do not occur. Illegal trade is due, partly, to an inadequate understanding of the species being traded and is facilitated by poor monitoring and enforcement at key trade hubs. As a first step to combatting illegal trade, and to better understand the effects of harvest on wild populations, we recommend the need for increased monitoring and enforcement, improving the knowledge base of species traded and educating consumers about the effects their demand for pets has on these species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Exploited for pets: the harvest and trade of amphibians and reptiles   from Indonesian New Guinea",0

From a conservation perspective, identifying the primary preferred habitats could help improve the foraging conditions of target species and, consequently, enhance their breeding success and survival. Here, we investigated the ranging behaviour and foraging habitat selection of the European roller (Coracias garrulus) during the breeding season in an agricultural landscape of South Iberia. The occurrence of foraging rollers was predicted to gradually increase with decreasing distance from the nest and increasing availability of perches, such as fences and electric wires. Traditional olive groves and stubble fields were positively and negatively associated with the occurrence of rollers, respectively. Additionally, analysis of hunting strikes showed that rollers highly prefer foraging in fallows rather than cereal or stubble fields. Prey surveys revealed that fallows had the highest abundance of grasshoppers, rollers’ preferred prey during chick-rearing. Pair home-ranges, obtained from 95% fixed Kernel estimators averaged 70.9 ha (range = 34–118 ha) and most foraging trips (80%) occurred in the close vicinity of the nest (<500 m). Number of chicks fledged was not affected by mean foraging distances travelled during the chick-rearing period. Overall, our results suggest that traditional extensive practices of cereal cultivation, with large areas of low-intensity grazed fallows, represent a high-quality foraging habitat for rollers and should be promoted through agri-environmental schemes within at least 1-km radius from the nest. These recommendations are targeted at the roller, but have been shown to apply broadly to several other steppe-bird species.","Landscape determinants of European roller foraging habitat: implications   for the definition of agri-environmental measures for species   conservation",0

We conducted surveys from 2003 to 2011 in eight of the 12 mountain blocks in Tanzania, and, through an overall sampling effort of 11,500 camera days, we detected 43 species. We normalized species richness and species’ detection events by effort, and used these metrics to assess the effect of habitat and human disturbance variables. We found that rarefied richness is positively affected by forest area at the block level, and that richness at forest patch level is also affected by forest area as well as surrounding human density (negative effect). For a subset of 17 species, we found consistent patterns of avoidance or tolerance of human disturbance and forest edges, and increased occurrence in areas at higher elevation, matching the historical forest loss that in most mountains occurred at lower elevation. Our study provides ecological insights that are novel for most species and sites, and reveals a general trend of negative impact of human disturbance on both community size and species’ relative abundance.

Management strategies are urgently required to halt further habitat decline and to aid in restoration of this important moss-dominated summit community. Grazing exclosure and phosphorus (P) addition experiments were conducted at 10 sites across the UK to assess the potential of Racomitrium heath to respond to (1) the removal of grazing pressure, and (2) the addition of P, a measure intended to alleviate the impacts of high N deposition. After two years, growth and depth of Racomitrium lanuginosum, the dominant moss species, were significantly enhanced by both treatments. However, while the addition of P resulted in increased cover of R. lanuginosum and decreased grass cover, grazing exclusion resulted in the opposite effects. While both practices clearly have the potential to promote improvement in the condition of Racomitrium heath, their suitability for individual sites appears to differ. Results indicate that for the most degraded heaths, where grass abundance is high, complete removal of grazing pressure may, at least initially, stimulate grass performance, potentially leading to further habitat decline. The addition of P, on the other hand, appears to produce desirable effects in terms of both R. lanuginosum performance and community composition, and thus could be used as a local management option to kick-start recovery in the most damaged heaths. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Grazing exclusion and phosphorus addition as potential local management   options for the restoration of alpine moss-sedge heath",0

There, the causes of decline have not been properly identified and conservation decisions are too frequently based on poor evidence. We analysed the trend of a relict capercaillie population in the Spanish Pyrenees on the basis of bird densities during the period 1989-2010, and we developed the first modelling exercise for the dynamics of a capercaillie population in southern Europe. We also explored management actions commonly used to enhance endangered prey species thought to be affected by hyperpredation: the release of captive-bred females, in varying numbers, the removal of predators and the combination of both actions, using available information from past captive-breeding experiments and from an ongoing experiment involving the removal of terrestrial mesopredators. The population was found to be declining at an annual rate of 4%. Restraining the unknown adult survival rate according to values reported in the literature, our modelling approach showed that recruitment (productivity. +. fledgling survival), rather than adult survival, was the demographic parameter to be improved as a result of management and, thus, most likely to increase the population growth rate. The removal of terrestrial mesocarnivores may lead to the stabilisation of the capercaillie population (lambda 0.99. ±. 0.06), through the improvement of productivity, although this result should be considered as preliminary. However, the most effective management strategy was the combination of predator removal together with the release of 15, 30 or 45 adult females per year. These strategies should be viewed as urgency measures and should be implemented in combination with other long-term measures, such as the reduction of forest density, which may influence predation rate and food availability, and the control of the numbers of wild ungulates, which could be subsidising mesopredators in the area.

The current extinction crisis has resulted in a wealth of monitoring programs focussed on tracking the status of threatened species, and the perceived importance of monitoring has seen it become the cornerstone of many biodiversity conservation programs. However, many monitoring programs fail to produce useful outcomes due to inherent flaws. Here we use a monitoring program from south-eastern Australia as a case study to illustrate the potential of such endeavours. The threatened carnivorous marsupial, the brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa), has been monitored at various locations between 2000 and 2010.

These results provide insights likely to be valuable in guiding future management of the species. In the absence of the monitoring program, informed management would not be possible. While early detection of population declines is important, knowledge of the processes driving such declines is required for effective intervention. We argue that monitoring programs will be most effective as a tool for enhanced conservation management if they test specific hypotheses relating to changes in population trajectories.

As an alternative livelihood, it has become the most prevalent human disturbance across the panda's range. How do free-ranging livestock impact giant panda habitats and what are the implications for future conservation and policy on a larger scale? We use Wanglang National Nature Reserve as a case study. It has seen a nine-fold livestock increase during past 15 years. We combined bamboo survey plots, GPS collar tracking, long-term monitoring, and species distribution modelling incorporating species interaction to understand the impacts across spatial and temporal scales. Our results showed that livestock, especially horses, lead to a significant reduction of bamboo biomass and regeneration. The most intensively used areas by livestock are in the valleys, which are also the areas that pandas prefer. Adding livestock presence to predictive models of the giant panda's distribution yielded a higher accuracy and suggested livestock reduce panda habitat by 34%. Pandas were driven out of the areas intensively used by livestock. We recommend the nature reserve carefully implement a livestock ban and prioritise removing horses because they cause the greater harm.

Despite the recent surge of studies of senescence in the wild, senescence patterns in species for which population dynamics assessments are crucial, such as translocated populations, remain virtually unexplored. Based on a 15-year nest survey of a North-African Houbara bustard population in Morocco, we investigated age variation in the breeding performance of captive-bred females released in the wild. We identified 781 females, from 1 to 10 years of age, on 1094 nests. We examined how age influenced nest initiation date, clutch size, egg volume, daily nest survival and daily brood survival, as well as whether age-dependent patterns varied according to environmental conditions. Most breeding parameters exhibited variation, suggesting an increase in breeding performance with age in young females (those from 1 to 3 years old). In older females (> 7–8 years old), the egg volume and clutch size decreased with age, in concordance with expectations from senescence theories and previous empirical results obtained from captive Houbara bustards. Finally, our analysis uncovered a significant interaction between age and the amount of precipitation prior to the breeding season on clutch size, suggesting differential abilities of females of different ages to increase their breeding investment. Our study suggests that life histories in translocated individuals are not affected by translocation protocols and provides insights for implementing age dependencies in population viability assessments.","Evidence of reproductive senescence of released individuals in a   reinforced bird population",0

Here we assess the effects of forest patch and landscape metrics on diurnal lizard species richness and composition within the Balbina Hydroelectric Dam and surrounding areas in the Central Brazilian Amazon. This 28-yr-old dam created a reservoir of ~ 4438 km2, comprising 3546 islands. We sampled 25 of these islands (0.83–1466 ha) and five mainland continuous forest sites, one of which placed along stream banks. We further related morpho-ecological traits and the geographic distribution of lizard species to the spatial metrics of islands where they occurred. Using 100 L-pitfall traps operated over 5447 trap-days, we recorded 1123 lizards from 17 taxa, two of which exclusively found along stream banks within continuous forest. Island area was the best predictor of species richness and composition. Small islands (= 2 ha) harboured fewer than a third of all species typically observed in larger islands and continuous forest (= 8 species), and only islands = 100 ha retained nearly complete lizard faunas. Lizard assemblages inhabiting small, isolated islands consisted almost exclusively of an oversimplified set of widely distributed, large-bodied, habitat generalist, heliophile species associated with open areas and forest edges, and that feed on a wide spectrum of prey sizes.

To address the technical limitations, we developed a method that uses the behavioral dynamics of target species as indicators of the efficacy of threat reduction, control, and overall management effort. By comparing wildlife behavior with threat avoidance distances and patterns we can examine threat mitigation efficacy as a proxy for overall reserve management effectiveness. Using evidence of giant panda habitat utilization in eleven reserves across Qinling Mountains from 2000 to 2012, we built a model of behavior based on the avoidance of four types of anthropogenic threat. We stratified the eleven reserves into five efficacies, of which Changqing reserve was deemed to have the highest management effectiveness. Our approach was validated and supported by changes in suitable habitat and population size across reserves. Focusing on the end result of all threats and management effort means that our framework is straightforward for reserve staff to implement, produces easily interpreted results, and is worthy of application.

Facility designs (whether culvert, weir or fish pass) with this SOH criterion guarantees complete migration failure of goldfish. Also, most (95–99%) of the barbels migrating populations will surpass the SOH regardless of body length; only the less capable or those in poor condition will be blocked.

We estimated the economic cost of not using seabird bycatch deterrents in Argentinean longline fisheries, with the intention of encouraging adoption of mitigation measures in those fisheries. We conducted the study in the Argentine ling Genypterus blacodes and Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides fisheries from 2001 to 2006 on three fishing vessels. Data on the incidence of seabird bycatch were collected by seabird observers specially trained in seabird identification and data on the catch rates of target species, cost of bait and fish were provided by the fishing company, supervised by Federal Inspectors from the Provincial Fisheries Agency. To estimate the bait loss, we set lines both with and without the use of deterrents (streamer lines, night setting and strategic discharge of offal) in both fisheries. Seabird bycatch varies temporally and geographically, so to estimate economic losses using deterrents in each fishery, we used different bycatch rates/1000 hooks registered for different periods and fishing areas. Bycatch rates in the absence of deterrents were two birds/1000 hooks and 1.53 birds/1000 hooks for the Patagonian toothfish and ling fisheries, respectively. These rates equate to the loss of more than 1.5 and 2 million dollars over a 10 year period for each fishery. When estimations are made with lower mortality rates, economic losses declined abruptly and were in the order of hundreds of dollars/fishing trip, for the same period of time. Results show that using deterrents, long term profits for the fishing company increase at a considerably high rate (the decrease in monetary loss is an order of magnitude), and the mortality of seabirds decreases by the same proportion (CPUE of seabirds decreases from tens of thousands to a few hundred).

In an environment under a high level of threat, the high breeding site fidelity (or breeding site persistence) of this species enables long term monitoring of colony site occupancy, colony size and other breeding parameters, which provide multiple indicators of population status. We surveyed known colony sites and searched for new sites in three recent breeding seasons in order to assess the current population status in the most important part of their range in Sierra Leone, the Gola Forest. We found 157 active nests at 40 colonies, equating to at least 314 adult birds. Less than half of the known colonies were protected by the Gola Forest Reserve. Colonies outside the reserve tended to be confined to larger rocks and subject to disturbance from human activities in close proximity, but did not have fewer active nests in them. Colonies outside the reserve were also more likely to be inactive in a given year whereas all colonies inside the reserve were active in every survey year. A predictive distribution model indicated that the survey region could have as many as 234 nests equating to at least 468 breeding birds. There was no evidence that mean colony size had declined since surveys undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s but it was not possible to compare colony abandonment rates inside and outside the reserve over that time period. Clutch and brood sizes were similar in each year, though brood size appeared slightly lower in the third survey year possibly because of a slightly later survey date. Mean clutch and brood sizes reported during the study period were similar to those found in the 1980s and 1990s. We conclude that the population of White-necked Picathartes in the Gola Forest area has been relatively stable over the last two decades, reflecting both the efficacy of protection afforded by the Gola Forest Reserve and presumably low pressure to farm new areas in the nearby community forest.

We estimated total species richness and number of forest specialist species to be highest in mature forest (191; 95% CI = 96, 287, and 88; 95% CI = 47, 129 respectively), lower in second-growth forest (158; 95% CI = 87, 245 and 58; 95% CI = 18, 98 respectively), and lowest in pine plantation (106; 95% CI = 52, 158 and 49; 95% CI = 2, 97 respectively). The estimated number of forest generalist species was similar between mature forest and second-growth forest (103; 95% CI = 17, 189 and 100; 95% CI = 42, 158, respectively) and least in pine plantation (57; 95% CI = 31, 82).

Across northern Iran, Little Bustard presence was confirmed at 15 of the 84 sites visited during the surveys. Three main wintering regions were identified: the Moghan Plain in the north-west of the country, the Turkmen Sahra Plain at the south-east corner of the Caspian Sea and the Sarakhs Plain in the north-east, close to the Afghan border. Up to 10,050 individuals were counted in winter 2009 in the Moghan Plain, which was recognised as the most important area for wintering Little Bustards in Iran. The species was also found in good numbers in Miankaleh, Gomishan, Soufikam, Shour Lake and Sarakhs. Flocks comprising 51 to 500 individuals were the most commonly observed and represented 32% of occurrences. A marked increase in wintering population size was noted in recent years. The main wintering period in Iran extends from November to February. At a national scale, we estimated the Iranian wintering population of Little Bustards at 5,000-10,000 individuals. This preliminary assessment suggests the need for a nationwide survey, emphasising in particular the western, south-western and central parts of the country that were overlooked in our study.

Here we compare nesting success of the Reed Parrotbill Paradoxornis heudei in annually harvested and non-harvested reedbed habitats in the Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve in China, by recording the number of nestlings produced per nest and the causes of nest failure. We modelled daily nest survival rate (DSR) by considering the effects of harvesting, vegetation characteristics, year, date, advancement within the breeding season, nest age and nearest-nest distance, using the program MARK. Nest densities, but not the number of fledglings per nest, were significantly lower in harvested than non-harvested reedbed habitats. The best-fit DSR model estimated constant survival; none of the tested co-variables had significant effects. Moreover, harvesting did not affect the date of breeding initiation, likelihood of nest failure, or causes of nest failure, as vegetation cover was not significantly different between harvested and non-harvested reedbeds during the whole breeding season. Nest failure following adverse weather conditions was unusually common in harvested and non-harvested reedbeds, accounting for as many nest failures as depredation. However, comparisons with other studies suggest that deriving a conclusion on the impact of harvesting on nesting success is not straightforward and is probably linked to environmental characteristics affecting reed growth. © 2011 BirdLife International.","Reproductive success of the threatened Reed Parrotbill Paradoxornis   heudei in non-harvested and harvested reedbeds in the Yangtze River   estuary, China",0

We studied the nesting requirements of the Tucuman Parrot and assessed cavity availability, reuse, and spatial pattern of nests in El Rey National Park-one of the last mature, undisturbed areas of the Southern Yungas forest. We recorded 44 nesting attempts in seven tree species, with most nests (95%) being located in live canopy trees > 60 cm DBH. Most parrot nest-cavities occurred in Blepharocalix salicifolius (60%) and cavities in this species were selected significantly more than expected based on availability. Nests were shallower and higher than nests of other Amazona species. For all years combined, mean nest density of Tucuman Parrot was 0.24 ± 0.04 nest ha-1 and the distance to the nearest active nest was significantly greater than the distance between all trees used as nests. Nesting pairs of Tucuman Parrot were separated by 144.1 ± 152.8 m, while potential nest-trees were 66.0 ± 55.4 m apart. Density of suitable cavities for nesting was 4.6 cavities ha-1. Approximately 16 suitable cavities were available for each breeding pair (0.24 breeding pair ha-1 and four suitable cavities ha-1) and 5% of the suitable cavities available were occupied, suggesting that suitable cavities are not a limiting resource. However, due to the territorial behaviour of breeding pairs, some of these cavities are unavailable to other breeding pairs.

Using systematic migration counts from multiple localities in the southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, as well as observations of their flight trajectories during eight consecutive years (2007-2014), we describe the magnitude of these movements, their geographic extent, and the phenology of the most abundant species in both spring and fall seasons. The most abundant species were Turkey Vulture Cathartes aura, Swainson's Hawk Buteo swainsoni, Broad-winged Hawk Buteo platypterus, Wood Stork Mycteria americana, American White Pelican Pelecanus erythrothynchos, Franklin's Gull Leucophaeus pipixcan, and American Kestrel Falco sparverius. In spring, the seasonal average magnitude of migration was over 28,000 birds, while in autumn the average was over one million. The aggregated seasonal phenologies recorded illustrate a variety of migration patterns. The inter-annual variation is lower in autumn than in spring. Migrating raptors and other soaring birds did not seem to use any topographical feature as a leading line for their movements in spring, while in autumn they did. We estimated the main axis of spring flights to run along a SE-NW vector, while autumn migration follows a WNW-ESE general trajectory. Our results place the isthmus as one of the five most important sites in the world for raptors and soaring migrants. Sustaining annual migration counts at these sites is of high importance to track substantial portions (> 90%) of the global population of Turkey Vulture and Swainson's Hawk, as well as over 10% of the global population of Broad-winged Hawk.

Recognising and enhancing the value of biodiversity outside, as well as inside, protected areas is increasingly important given recognition that biodiversity targets will not be met through protected areas alone. We investigated the extent to which protection influences colony occupancy and colony size of a species of conservation concern, the rock-nesting White-necked Picathartes Picathartes gymnocephalus. We used mixed models to compare long term trends at 42 colonies located both inside and outside a protected area of forest, Gola Rainforest National Park, and considered colonies further inside the boundary as being better protected. Colony occupation was primarily predicted by the level of protection, with occupation highest within protected areas, but was not different between colonies situated close to or far from the boundary. Mean colony occupation was consistently high in protected areas, and lower in unprotected areas. The surface area of colony rocks was also an important predictor with larger rock faces having a higher probability of occupancy. Our best models also included distance to forested habitat, presence of cleared forest and evidence of hunting as less important predictors. Over the eight-year study, after controlling for rock surface area, active colony size declined significantly. However, declines were only significant in colonies in unprotected forest, whilst colonies located within protected areas were buffered from significant decline. Together this suggests colony occupancy and the number of active nests are influenced by protection and human disturbance. Although a lack of demographic and population dynamic work on picathartes prevents identifying mechanisms, we show that despite unprotected colonies having lower occupancy and fewer active nests they can persist in human altered and disturbed areas, partly because larger traditionally used rocks remain important nesting sites.","The importance of protected and unprotected areas for colony occupancy   and colony size in White-necked Picathartes Picathartes gymnocephalus in   and around Gola Rainforest National Park, Sierra Leone",1

New information suggests that these populations should be considered as different evolutionarily significant units. The latter population breeds in Austral Patagonia (Argentina and Chile) and overwinters in Central Argentina. It was a very common species in Austral Magellanic steppe grasslands before 1931, when it was declared an agricultural pest by the Argentinian government, together with other sheldgeese species. Since then, the continental Ruddy-headed Goose population has declined becoming one of the scarcest species in Austral Magellanic steppe. Nowadays, its population is categorised as critically endangered in Argentina and endangered in Chile. We present data from six road censuses conducted in the breeding areas of Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego provinces, Argentina, during 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 (>4600 km, 70 days) and review population trends of the Ruddy-headed Goose since the early 1900s. We counted a maximum of 19 individuals in Santa Cruz and 49 in Tierra del Fuego throughout the breeding season. A literature review indicates that during the last 40 years the size of continental population of Ruddy-headed Goose has been < 800 individuals, approximately 10% of the estimated population in the 1900s. This decline matches the period following the application of control techniques and the introduction of exotic predator species in the breeding grounds of Tierra del Fuego. We review and discuss formerly proposed conservation actions that may have a positive and rapid effect on sheldgoose numbers recovery. We suggest that the continental population of Ruddy-headed Goose should on a precautionary basis be treated as a critically endangered population until genetic studies determine whether we are in the presence of a new 'Critically Endangered' species.","Ruddy-headed Goose Chloephaga rubidiceps: former plague and present   protected species on the edge of extinction",1

The results indicated a decline of > 35% in mean abundance from 2001 to 2014. In addition, male abundance has shifted and is now positively related to distance from the forest edge. High levels of human disturbance close to the forest edge may have resulted in the birds moving to the core of the forest, suggesting a need to increase protection and management of forest edge areas.

Range data on forest dependent bird species from the South African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP1 and SABAP2) were analysed to determine links between deforestation, species characteristics and range declines. Half of the species studied were found to have declining ranges. Range change data for these species were correlated with data on changes in land cover from 1990 to 2014. To determine which land cover changes affect extinction, occupancy was modelled for 30 sites across South Africa which experienced a loss of more than 10 species. Most species lost were birds of prey or insectivores. Indigenous forest decreased in 17% (n = 5) sites, while plantations/woodlots decreased in 60% (n = 18) sites. Occupancy modelling showed extinction to be mitigated by plantations in 6/28 species, and forest expansion mitigated extinction in 7/28 species. Responses to deforestation did not appear to be related to particular species characteristics. Half of South Africa's forest-dependent bird species have declining ranges, with the loss of these species most prominent in the Eastern Cape province. Four responses to changes in forest and plantation cover are discussed: direct effects, with forest loss causing species loss; matrix effects, where plantation loss resulted in species loss; degradation of indigenous forest; and the advent of new forest arising from woody thickening caused by carbon fertilisation, which may not result in optimal habitat for forest-dependent birds.","Atlas data indicate forest dependent bird species declines in South   Africa",0

Apart from the effect of environmental factors on breeding performance, this negative population trend is likely to be explained by increasing anthropogenic pressures associated with an upsurge of recreational activities on and around the island as well as the introduction of mammal predators.

We used French Frigate Shoals, the largest atoll in the Hawaiian Archipelago, as a case study to explore the population dynamics of seabird colonies and the potential effects sea-level rise may have on these rookeries. We compiled historic observations, a 30-year time series of seabird population abundance, lidar-derived elevations, and aerial imagery of all the islands of French Frigate Shoals. To estimate the population dynamics of 8 species of breeding seabirds on Tern Island from 1980 to 2009, we used a Gompertz model with a Bayesian approach to infer population growth rates, density dependence, process variation, and observation error. All species increased in abundance, in a pattern that provided evidence of density dependence. Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor), Masked Boobies (Sula dactylatra), Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda), Spectacled Terns (Onychoprion lunatus), and White Terns (Gygis alba) are likely at carrying capacity. Density dependence may exacerbate the effects of sea-level rise on seabirds because populations near carrying capacity on an island will be more negatively affected than populations with room for growth. We projected 12% of French Frigate Shoals will be inundated if sea level rises 1 m and 28% if sea level rises 2 m. Spectacled Terns and shrub-nesting species are especially vulnerable to sea-level rise, but seawalls and habitat restoration may mitigate the effects of sea-level rise.

We evaluated the trade-off among sustainable food production, profitability, and conservation objectives in the groundfish bottom-trawl fishery off the U.S. West Coast, where depletion (i.e., reduction in abundance) of six rockfish species (Sebastes) is of particular concern. Trade-offs are inherent in this multispecies fishery because there is limited capacity to target species individually. From population models and catch of 34 stocks of bottom fish, we calculated the relation between harvest rate, long-term yield (i.e., total weight of fish caught), profit, and depletion of each species. In our models, annual ecosystem-wide yield from all 34 stocks was maximized with an overall 5.4% harvest rate, but profit was maximized at a 2.8% harvest rate. When we reduced harvest rates to the level (2.2% harvest rate) at which no stocks collapsed (<10% of unfished levels), biomass harvested was 76% of the maximum sustainable yield and profit 89% of maximum. A harvest rate under which no stocks fell below the biomass that produced maximum sustainable yield (1% harvest rate), resulted in 45% of potential yield and 67% of potential profit. Major reductions in catch in the late 1990s led to increase in the biomass of the most depleted stocks, but this rebuilding resulted in the loss of >30% of total sustainable yield, whereas yield lost from stock depletion was 3% of total sustainable yield.

In doing so, they allow one to identify influential nodes that are not well studied empirically so that future research can be prioritized. We identified relationships in host and pathogen biology to examine disease-driven declines of amphibians associated with amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). We constructed a Bayesian network consisting of behavioral, genetic, physiological, and environmental variables that influence disease and used them to predict host population trends. We varied the impacts of specific variables in the model to reveal factors with the most influence on host population trend. The behavior of the nodes (the way in which the variables probabilistically responded to changes in states of the parents, which are the nodes or variables that directly influenced them in the graphical model) was consistent with published results. The frog population had a 49% probability of decline when all states were set at their original values, and this probability increased when body temperatures were cold, the immune system was not suppressing infection, and the ambient environment was conducive to growth of B. dendrobatidis. These findings suggest the construction of our model reflected the complex relationships characteristic of host–pathogen interactions. Changes to climatic variables alone did not strongly influence the probability of population decline, which suggests that climate interacts with other factors such as the capacity of the frog immune system to suppress disease. Changes to the adaptive immune system and disease reservoirs had a large effect on the population trend, but there was little empirical information available for model construction.

Unlike other classes of vertebrates, however, small freshwater fishes appear to have an equal or greater risk of extinction than large fishes. We explored whether particular traits explain the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List conservation status of small-bodied freshwater fishes from 4 temperate river basins: Murray-Darling, Australia; Danube, Europe; Mississippi-Missouri, North America; and the Rio Grande, North America. Twenty-three ecological and life-history traits were collated for all 171 freshwater fishes of =120 mm total length. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to assess which combination of the 23 traits best explained whether a species was threatened or not threatened. We used the best models to predict the probability of 29 unclassified species being listed as threatened. With and without controlling for phylogeny at the family level, small body size—among small-bodied species—was the most influential trait correlated with threatened species listings. The k-folds cross-validation demonstrated that body size and a random effect structure that included family predicted the threat status with an accuracy of 78% (SE 0.5). We identified 10 species likely to be threatened that are not listed as such on the IUCN Red List. Small body size is not a trait that provides universal resistance to extinction, particularly for vertebrates inhabiting environments affected by extreme habitat loss and fragmentation. We hypothesize that this is because small-bodied species have smaller home ranges, lower dispersal capabilities, and heightened ecological specialization relative to larger vertebrates. Trait data and further model development are needed to predict the IUCN conservation status of the over 11,000 unclassified freshwater fishes, especially those under threat from proposed dam construction in the world's most biodiverse river basins.","Trait-based prediction of extinction risk of small-bodied freshwater   fishes",0

Conflict is inextricably linked to the ecological processes shaping relationships between pastoralists and native herbivores and carnivores. To elucidate relationships underpinning human–wildlife conflict, we synthesized 15 years of ecological and ethnographic data from Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in Mongolia's Gobi steppe. The density of argali (Ovis ammon), the world's largest wild sheep, at Ikh Nart was among the highest in Mongolia, yet livestock were >90% of ungulate biomass and dogs >90% of large-carnivore biomass. For argali, pastoral activities decreased food availability, increased mortality from dog predation, and potentially increased disease risk. Isotope analyses indicated that livestock accounted for >50% of the diet of the majority of gray wolves (Canis lupus) and up to 90% of diet in 25% of sampled wolves (n = 8). Livestock composed at least 96% of ungulate prey in the single wolf pack for which we collected species-specific prey data. Interviews with pastoralists indicated that wolves annually killed 1–4% of Ikh Nart's livestock, and pastoralists killed wolves in retribution. Pastoralists reduced wolf survival by killing them, but their livestock were an abundant food source for wolves. Consequently, wolf density appeared to be largely decoupled from argali density, and pastoralists had indirect effects on argali that could be negative if pastoralists increased wolf density (apparent competition) or positive if pastoralists decreased wolf predation (apparent facilitation). Ikh Nart's argali population was stable despite these threats, but livestock are increasingly dominant numerically and functionally relative to argali. To support both native wildlife and pastoral livelihoods, we suggest training dogs to not kill argali, community insurance against livestock losses to wolves, reintroducing key native prey species to hotspots of human–wolf conflict, and developing incentives for pastoralists to reduce livestock density.","Desert pastoralists' negative and positive effects on rare wildlife in   the Gobi",1

Although intact primary forests harbor many Himalayan birds during breeding, a large number of bird species use agricultural lands during winter. We assessed how Himalayan bird species richness, abundance, and composition during winter are affected by forest loss stemming from agriculture and grazing. Bird surveys along 12 elevational transects within primary forest, low-intensity agriculture, mixed subsistence agriculture, and intensively grazed pastures in winter revealed that bird species richness and abundance were greatest in low-intensity and mixed agriculture, intermediate in grazed pastures, and lowest in primary forest at both local and landscape scales; over twice as many species and individuals were recorded in low-intensity agriculture than in primary forest. Bird communities in primary forests were distinct from those in all other land-use classes, but only 4 species were unique to primary forests. Low-, medium-, and high-intensity agriculture harbored 32 unique species. Of the species observed in primary forest, 80% had equal or greater abundance in low-intensity agricultural lands, underscoring the value of these lands in retaining diverse community assemblages at high densities in winter. Among disturbed landscapes, bird species richness and abundance declined as land-use intensity increased, especially in high-intensity pastures. Our results suggest that agricultural landscapes are important for most Himalayan bird species in winter. But agricultural intensification—especially increased grazing—will likely result in biodiversity losses. Given that forest reserves alone may inadequately conserve Himalayan birds in winter, comprehensive conservation strategies in the region must go beyond protecting intact primary forests and ensure that low-intensity agricultural lands are not extensively converted to high-intensity pastures.","The importance of agricultural lands for Himalayan birds in winter",0

Moreover, in species that occupy fragmented habitats it is essential to know how landscape characteristics may affect the genetic connectivity among populations. In this study we use eight microsatellite markers to analyze population structure and gene flow patterns in the complete geographic range of the endangered rodent Ctenomys porteousi. Also, we use landscape genetics approaches to evaluate the effects of landscape configuration on the genetic connectivity among populations. In spite of geographical proximity of the sampling sites (8-27 km between the nearest sites) and the absence of marked barriers to individual movement, strong population structure and low values of gene flow were observed. Genetic differentiation among sampling sites was consistent with a simple model of isolation by distance, where peripheral areas showed higher population differentiation than those sites located in the central area of the species' distribution. Landscape genetics analysis suggested that habitat fragmentation at regional level has affected the distribution of genetic variation among populations. The distance of sampling sites to areas of the landscape having higher habitat connectivity was the environmental factor most strongly related to population genetic structure. In general, our results indicate strong genetic structure in C. porteousi, even at a small spatial scale, and suggest that habitat fragmentation could increase the population differentiation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Population structure and landscape genetics in the endangered   subterranean rodent Ctenomys porteousi",0

Natural landscape features are known to influence connectivity, but global anthropogenic landscape change underscores the importance of quantifying how human-modified landscapes disrupt connectivity of natural populations. Grasslands of western North America have experienced extensive habitat alteration, fragmenting populations of species such as black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Population sizes and the geographic range of prairie dogs have been declining for over a century due to habitat loss, disease, and eradication efforts. In many places, prairie dogs have persisted in the face of emerging urban landscapes that carve habitat into smaller and smaller fragments separated by uninhabitable areas. In extreme cases, prairie dog colonies are completely bounded by urbanization. Connectivity is particularly important for prairie dogs because colonies suffer high probabilities of extirpation by plague, and dispersal permits recolonization. Here we explore connectivity of prairie dog populations using analyses of 11 microsatellite loci for 9 prairie dog colonies spanning the fragmented landscape of Boulder County, Colorado. Isolation-by-resistance modeling suggests that wetlands and high intensity urbanization limit movement of prairie dogs. However, prairie dogs appear to move moderately well through low intensity development (including roads) and freely through cropland and grassland. Additionally, there is a marked decline in gene flow between colonies with increasing geographic distance, indicating isolation by distance even in an altered landscape. Our results suggest that prairie dog colonies retain some connectivity despite fragmentation by urbanization and agricultural development. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Connectivity of prairie dog colonies in an altered landscape: inferences   from analysis of microsatellite DNA variation",0

The Sooglossidae are a family of frog species endemic to the Seychelles islands that are believed to have evolved in isolation for approximately 75 million years. Formerly thought to inhabit just two Seychelles islands (Mahé and Silhouette), a third population was discovered on Praslin in 2009. Phylogenetic analysis based on 438 bp of mitochondrial 16S rRNA suggests that the Praslin population is most closely related to Sooglossus sechellensis from Silhouette, and identifies these as two separate clades which together sit distinct from the population on Mahé. An average of 4. 06% uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence between the Praslin and Silhouette populations suggests substantial evolutionary divergence rather than recent introduction. Discriminant function analysis also revealed differences in morphology in frogs from Praslin and Mahé. DNA sequences of two Praslin specimens group more closely with the Mahé population, indicating some shared haplotypes that suggest recent secondary contact. Tests for a genetic signature of recent population expansion on either island were not significant. Our results suggest substantial evolutionary divergence between the three populations of S. sechellensis, most likely following isolation due to changes in sea level in the Indian Ocean. Whilst further genetic sampling and ecological studies are needed, our initial phylogenetic analyses suggest that the sooglossid population on Praslin should be managed as an evolutionarily significant unit to retain the uniqueness of its genetic diversity and its evolutionary trajectory within this ancient family of amphibians. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Evidence for evolutionary distinctiveness of a newly discovered   population of sooglossid frogs on Praslin Island, Seychelles",0

Such a scenario may be playing out within Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister) metapopulations as a series of synergistic extrinsic pressures have contributed to the rangewide decline of the species over the last 40 years. Our goal was to elucidate the effects of demographic collapse on metapopulation function by using 11 microsatellites markers to quantify differences in patterns of connectivity and genetic diversity between a demographically stable metapopulation and one in severe demographic decline. The demographically diminished metapopulation had lower levels of genetic diversity than the stable metapopulation at all levels evaluated (metapopulation-, subpopulation-, and individual-scales). In contrast to patterns of connectivity observed within the stable metapopulation, peripheral subpopulations in the diminished metapopulation had become completely isolated and were drifting toward genetic fixation, likely as a result of the extirpation of stepping-stone subpopulations. The declining genetic parameters observed within these isolated peripheral subpopulations suggest that inbreeding depression may be contributing significantly to their demographic decline. Allegheny woodrats readily express the genetic consequences of metapopulation decline due to the low effective population sizes of subpopulations and the species' limited dispersal capacity. Differences in genetic parameters observed between demographically stable and diminished Allegheny woodrat metapopulations emphasize the risks posed to metapopulation function and associated genetic processes introduced with demographic decline. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Consequences of metapopulation collapse: comparison of genetic   attributes between two Allegheny woodrat metapopulations",0

Bayesian assignment approaches-perhaps the most conservative analyses we performed-consistently grouped the sites into two distinct groups, with all individuals from the smallest and most isolated population clustering separately from the other four sites. Additional analyses revealed (1) overall significant genetic structure; (2) a pattern of population differentiation consistent with a hypothesis of isolation by resistance (landscape connectivity), but not distance; and (3) relatively short dispersal distances indicated by elevated mean pairwise relatedness in several of the sites.

First, we use targeted amplicon sequencing to describe the spatial pattern of genetic divergence using two marker types (57 anonymous ddRAD-derived loci and mtDNA cytb). Second, we quantify the degree of admixture and hybridization between two previously-unidentified divergent lineages within Belize. Third, we assess whether the existing group of marine protected areas (MPAs) in Belize protects this cryptic genetic diversity. The results provide strong evidence for two divergent genetic lineages of E. lori within Belize, separated geographically by only 30 km of low-suitability habitat. There is a sharp genetic cline across these 30 km, and evidence of admixture and introgression at the boundary regions of the habitat break.

We combined genetic analyses using microsatellite and mitochondrial markers with species distribution patterns. In both time periods, replicate genetic sampling (n = 85; five sites) and field population surveys (93 sites) were conducted. We compared the distribution of parental species and hybrids and estimates for hybrid zone width and center between the two time periods. An increase in the relative proportion of Nelson’s sparrows in sympatric marshes and an approximate doubling of hybrid zone width provides evidence for expansion. Introgression rates increased over time for neutral loci but declined for a mitochondrial gene and two gene-associated loci under the influence of selection, as expected under a speciation model with barriers to gene flow. On average, the center of the hybrid zone shifted 60 km southward over the 15 years. We placed our findings within a policy framework to evaluate management options for hybrids. We conclude that despite increasing rates of introgression, hybridization poses a substantially lesser threat to parental populations than the imminent consequences of sea-level rise and habitat degradation. Based on our current knowledge of hybrid zone dynamics in this system, we conclude that the conservation of hybrids is warranted along with parental species at this time.","Temporal shifts in the saltmarsh-Nelson's sparrow hybrid zone revealed   by replicated demographic and genetic surveys",0

Here, we present a landscape genetic analysis in the last remaining uninfected parts of the Tasmanian devil’s geographic range to: describe population genetic structure, characterize genetic diversity, and test the influence of landscape variables on Tasmanian devil gene flow to assess the potential for disease spread. In contrast to previous genetic studies on Tasmanian devils showing evidence for two genetic populations island-wide, our genetic based assignment tests and spatial principal components analyses suggest at least two, and possibly three, populations in a study area that is approximately 15% of the size of the overall species’ geographic range. Positive spatial autocorrelation declined at about 40 km, in contrast to 80 km in eastern populations, highlighting the need for range-wide genetic studies. Strong genetic structure was found between devils in the northern part of the study area and those found south of Macquarie Harbor, with weaker structure found between the northeastern and northwestern portion of our study area. Consistent with previous work, we found low overall genetic diversity, likely owing to a combination of founder effects and extreme weather events thousands of years ago that likely caused large-scale population declines. We also found possible signs of recent bottlenecks, perhaps resulting from forest clearing for dairy farming in the central part of the study area. This human disturbance also may have contributed to weak genetic structuring detected between the northeastern and northwestern part of the study area. Individual-based least cost path modeling showed limited influence of landscape variables on gene flow, with weak effects of variation in elevation in the northeast. In the northwest, however, landscape genetic models did not perform better than the null isolation-by-distance model. At the larger spatial scale of the northern part of the study area, elevation and temperatures were negatively correlated with gene flow, consistent with low dispersal suitability of higher elevation habitats that have lower temperatures and dense, wet vegetation. Overall, Tasmanian devils are a highly vagile species for which dispersal and gene flow appear to be influenced little by landscape features, and spread of devil facial tumor disease to the remaining portion of the devil’s geographic range seems imminent.

We collected data on Antarctic fur seals from 1987/1988 to 1994/1995 at Seal Island, Antarctica. The BHM allowed us to link together predators and prey into a model that uses all the data efficiently and accounts for major sources of uncertainty. Based on the literature, we made hypotheses about the relationships in the model, which we compared with the model outcome after fitting the BHM. For each BHM parameter, we calculated the mean of the posterior density and the 95% credible interval. Our model confirmed others' findings that increased sea ice was related to increased krill density. Higher krill density led to reduced dive intensity of maternal fur seals, as measured by dive depth and duration, and to less time spent foraging by maternal fur seals. Heavier maternal fur seals and lower maternal foraging effort resulted in heavier pups at 22 d. No relationship was found between krill density and maternal mass, or between maternal mass and foraging effort on pup growth rates between 22 and 85 days of age. Maternal mass may have reflected environmental conditions prior to the pup provisioning season, rather than summer prey densities.

The 1980 eruption of the Mount St. Helens volcano in Washington, USA, provided a unique opportunity to test biotic effects of a large-scale stochastic disturbance, as well as the influence of post-disturbance management. Despite severe alteration of nearly 600 km2 of habitat, coastal tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei) were found within a portion of the blast area five years after eruption. We investigated the genetic source of recolonization within the blast area and tested whether post-eruption salvage logging and subsequent tree planting influenced tailed frog movement patterns. Our results support widespread recolonization across the blast area from multiple sources, as all sites are grouped into one genetic cluster. Landscape genetic models suggest that gene flow through the unmanaged portion of the blast area is influenced only by distance between sites and the frost-free period (r2 = 0.74). In contrast, gene flow pathways within the blast area where salvage logging and replanting occurred post-eruption are strongly limited (r2 = 0.83) by the physiologically important variables of heat load and precipitation. These data suggest that the lack of understory and coarse wood (downed and standing dead tree boles) refugia in salvaged areas may leave frogs more susceptible to desiccation and mortality than those frogs moving through the naturally regenerated area. Simulated populations based on the landscape genetic models show an increase in the inbreeding coefficient in the managed area relative to the unmanaged blast area. In sum, we show surprising resilience of an amphibian species to a catastrophic disturbance, and we suggest that, at least for this species, naturally regenerating habitat may better maintain longterm genetic diversity of populations than actively managed habitat. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Genetic structure among coastal tailed frog populations at Mount St.   Helens is moderated by post-disturbance management",0

Leaf damage by herbivorous insects can negatively affect the growth and survival of tropical plants and thus can influence the success of tropical forest restoration efforts. We used an exclosure experiment to examine the top-down effects of birds and bats on insects and leaf damage in a large-scale forest restoration experiment. Given the potential influence of tree planting design on bird and bat abundances, we also investigated planting design effects on bird and bat insectivory and leaf damage. The experiment included two planting treatment plots: islands, where trees were planted in patches, and plantations, where trees were planted in rows to create continuous cover. In both types of plots, insect biomass was highest on tree branches where both birds and bats were excluded from foraging and lowest on branches without exclosures where both birds and bats were present. In the island plots, birds and bats had approximately equal impacts on insect populations, while in plantations bats appeared to have a slightly stronger effect on insects than did birds. In plantations, the levels of leaf damage were higher on branches where birds and bats were excluded than on branches where both had access. In island plots, no significant differences in leaf damage were found between exclosure treatments although potential patterns were in the same direction as in the plantations.

The inability of managers to anticipate environment-driven fluctuations in stock productivity or distribution can lead to overfishing and stock collapses, inflexible management regulations inducing shifts in the functional response to human predators, lost opportunities to harvest populations, bankruptcies in the fishing industry, and loss of resilience in the human food supply. Recent advances in dynamical global climate prediction systems allow for sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly predictions at a seasonal scale over many shelf ecosystems. Here we assess the utility of SST predictions at this ""fishery relevant"" scale to inform management, using Pacific sardine as a case study. The value of SST anomaly predictions to management was quantified under four harvest guidelines (HGs) differing in their level of integration of SST data and predictions. The HG that incorporated stock biomass forecasts informed by skillful SST predictions led to increases in stock biomass and yield, and reductions in the probability of yield and biomass falling below socioeconomic or ecologically acceptable levels. However, to mitigate the risk of collapse in the event of an erroneous forecast, it was important to combine such forecast-informed harvest controls with additional harvest restrictions at low biomass.","Improved management of small pelagic fisheries through seasonal climate   prediction",1

While the response of taxonomic diversity to forest management has received a great deal of scrutiny, the response of functional diversity is largely unexplored. However, functional diversity may represent a more direct link between biodiversity and ecosystem function. To examine how forest management affects diversity at multiple spatial scales, we analyzed a long-term data set that captured changes in taxonomic and functional diversity of moths (Lepidoptera), longhorned beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), and breeding birds in response to contemporary silvicultural systems in oak-hickory hardwood forests. We used these data sets to address the following questions: how do even- and uneven-aged silvicultural systems affect taxonomic and functional diversity at the scale of managed landscapes compared to the individual harvested and unharvested forest patches that comprise the landscapes, and how do these silvicultural systems affect the functional similarity of assemblages at the scale of managed landscapes and patches? Due to increased heterogeneity within landscapes, we expected even-aged silviculture to increase and uneven-aged silviculture to decrease functional diversity at the landscape level regardless of impacts at the patch level. Functional diversity responses were taxon-specific with respect to the direction of change and time since harvest. Responses were also consistent across patch and landscape levels within each taxon. Moth assemblage species richness, functional richness, and functional divergence were negatively affected by harvesting, with stronger effects resulting from uneven-aged than even-aged management. Longhorned beetle assemblages exhibited a peak in species richness two years after harvesting, while functional diversity metrics did not differ between harvested and unharvested patches and managed landscapes. The species and functional richness of breeding bird assemblages increased in response to harvesting with more persistent effects in uneven- than in even-aged managed landscapes. For moth and bird assemblages, species turnover was driven by species with more extreme trait combinations.

To prioritize conservation of vulnerable species, it is therefore critical to effectively predict species' responses to invasive plants, which may be facilitated by a framework based on species' traits. We studied the population and community responses of small mammals and changes in habitat heterogeneity across a gradient of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) cover, a widespread invasive plant in North America. We live-trapped small mammals over two summers and assessed the effect of cheatgrass on native small mammal abundance, richness, and species-specific and trait-based occupancy, while accounting for detection probability and other key habitat elements. Abundance was only estimated for the most common species, deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). All species were pooled for the trait-based occupancy analysis to quantify the ability of small mammal traits (habitat association, mode of locomotion, and diet) to predict responses to cheatgrass invasion. Habitat heterogeneity decreased with cheatgrass cover. Deer mouse abundance increased marginally with cheatgrass. Species richness did not vary with cheatgrass, however, pocket mouse (Perognathus spp.) and harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys spp.) occupancy tended to decrease and increase, respectively, with cheatgrass cover, suggesting a shift in community composition. Cheatgrass had little effect on occupancy for deer mice, 13-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), and Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii). Species' responses to cheatgrass primarily corresponded with our a priori predictions based on species' traits. The probability of occupancy varied significantly with a species' habitat association but not with diet or mode of locomotion. When considered within the context of a rapid habitat change, such as caused by invasive plants, relevant species' traits may provide a useful framework for predicting species' responses to a variety of habitat disturbances. Understanding which species are likely to be most affected by exotic plant invasion will help facilitate more efficient, targeted management and conservation of native species and habitats.","Species' traits help predict small mammal responses to habitat   homogenization by an invasive grass",0

This requires an understanding of ecological resilience: the ability of an ecosystem to return to the same state following a perturbation, which can strongly depend on species interactions across trophic levels. We use a structured model of a temperate rocky reef to explore how multi-trophic level fisheries impact ecological resilience. Increasing fishing mortality of prey (urchins) has a minor effect on equilibrium biomass of kelp, urchins, and spiny lobster predators, but increases resilience by reducing the range of predator harvest rates at which alternative stable states are possible. Size-structured predation on urchins acts as the feedback maintaining each state.

Life table response experiments (LTRE) aim to decompose the effects of change in parameters on past demographic outcomes (e.g., population growth rates). But the vast majority of LTREs and other retrospective population analyses have focused on decomposing asymptotic population growth rates, which do not account for the dynamic interplay between population structure and vital rates that shape realized population growth rates (<U+03BB>t=Nt+1/Nt) in time-varying environments. We provide an empirical means to overcome these shortcomings by merging recently developed ""transient life-table response experiments"" with integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs allow for the estimation of latent population structure and other demographic parameters that are required for transient LTRE analysis, and Bayesian versions additionally allow for complete error propagation from the estimation of demographic parameters to derivations of realized population growth rates and perturbation analyses of growth rates. By integrating available monitoring data for Lesser Scaup over 60 yr, and conducting transient LTREs on IPM estimates, we found that the contribution of juvenile female survival to long-term variation in realized population growth rates was 1.6 and 3.7 times larger than that of adult female survival and fecundity, respectively. But a persistent long-term decline in fecundity explained 92% of the decline in abundance between 1983 and 2006. In contrast, an improvement in adult female survival drove the modest recovery in Lesser Scaup abundance since 2006, indicating that the most important demographic drivers of Lesser Scaup population dynamics are temporally dynamic. In addition to resolving uncertainty about Lesser Scaup population dynamics, the merger of IPMs with transient LTREs will strengthen our understanding of demography for many species as we aim to conserve biodiversity during an era of non-stationary global change.","Understanding the demographic drivers of realized population growth   rates",0

Global warming and other environmental changes have favored the success of invasive species, deeply modifying the structure of aquatic communities in large rivers. Some exogenous species could alter trophic interactions within assemblages by increasing the predation risk for potential prey species (top-down effect) and limiting the dynamics of others via resource availability limitation (bottom-up effect). Furthermore, large transboundary rivers are complex aquatic ecosystems that have often been poorly investigated so that data for assessing long-term ecological trends are missing. In this study, we propose an original approach for investigating long-term combined effects of global warming, trophic resource decrease, predation risk, and water quality variations on the trait-based structure of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages over 26 yr (1985-2011) and 427-km stretch of the river Meuse (France and Belgium). The study of temporal variations in biological, physiological, and ecological traits of macroinvertebrate and fish allowed identifying community trends and distinguishing impacts of environmental perturbations from those induced by biological alterations. We provide evidence, for this large European river, of an increase in water temperature (close to 1°C) and a decrease in phytoplankton biomass (-85%), as well as independent effects of these changes on both invertebrate and fish communities. The reduction of trophic resources in the water column by invasive molluscs has dramatically affected the density of omnivorous fish in favor of invertebrate feeders, while scrapers became the major feeding guild among invertebrates.

For these reasons it is important to understand professional and public opinions as to which aspects of such crimes make them more or less serious, and so deserving of a greater or lesser sentence. Conjoint analysis, a method used in marketing to understand which characteristics of a product are valued by consumers, was used to investigate which attributes of hypothetical wildlife trade offences (threat status and taxon of species involved, illegal profit, previous convictions and plea) UK-based conservation professionals, magistrates and the general public considered most important when sentencing wildlife criminals in the UK.

To balance exploitation and conservation, elements of spatial management are required, whereby some seamounts are protected before any fishing has occurred. Protected areas should include entire seamounts, and multiple seamounts in a network.

Potential underlying causes of divergent perceptions towards different management tools were evaluated, including marine protected areas, no-take fisheries closures, gear use, minimum size of fish caught and species restrictions. The analysis identified three distinct opinion groups: (1) a group of nine landing sites that scaled their preference for most management restrictions neutral to low, with exceptions for minimum sizes of captured fish and gear restrictions; (2) a group of eight landing sites that scaled their preference for the above and species restrictions and closed season higher, and were more neutral about closures and marine protected areas; and (3) a group containing four landing sites and the managers' offices that rated their preference for the above and closed areas and marine protected areas as high. Logistic regression was used to examine whether these groups differed in wealth, education, age, perceptions of disparity in benefits, dependence on fishing and distance to government marine protected areas. The most frequent significant factor was the resource users' perceived disparity between the benefits of the management to themselves and their communities, with the benefits to the government.

We use this case-study to develop life history-based research and monitoring priorities for migratory salmonids. In Vänern, small wild populations of salmon and trout remain only in the heavily regulated Rivers Klar (Klarälven) and Gullspång (Gullspångsälven), and commercial and sport fisheries are maintained by hatchery stocking. These populations represent some of the last remaining large-bodied (up to 20kg) landlocked salmon stocks worldwide.

Hatchery return rates for three of four stocks appear stable at roughly 1% and annual fisheries catch is roughly 75metric tons, with an estimated 7.5% of hatchery smolts being recruited to the fishery; this also appears relatively stable since 1990. Our analysis reveals much uncertainty in key data requirements, including both river return and fisheries catch rates, estimates of wild smolt production and survival, and hatchery breeding and genetics protocols.

Moreover, whereas data show that in Ireland, cheaper species are sold as cod, in the UK, threatened Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) may be sold as 'sustainably sourced' Pacific cod. Considering these countries operate under the same EU policies for seafood traceability and labelling, it is likely that this situation has been influenced by heightened consumer awareness in the UK, which has created an environment where mislabelling is discouraged. In addition to identifying samples, traceability information from packaged cod was used to trace products back to supplying companies. Although inconclusive in determining blame, this exercise has demonstrated that using traceability information can add explanatory power when attempting to determine responsibility for the occurrence of mislabelling. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Seafood mislabelling: comparisons of two western European case studies   assist in defining influencing factors, mechanisms and motives",0

A southern Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of eulachon - that occurs in the California Current and is composed of numerous subpopulations that spawn in rivers from northern California to northern British Columbia - was identified on the basis of ecological and environmental characteristics, and to a lesser extent, genetic and life history variation. Although the northern terrestrial boundary of this DPS remains uncertain, our consensus opinion was that this northern boundary occurs south of the Nass River and that the DPS was discrete from more northern eulachon, as well as significant to the biological species as a whole and thus is a 'species' under the ESA. Eulachon have been nearly absent in northern California for over two decades, have declined in the Fraser River by over 97% in the past 10years, and are at historically low levels in other British Columbia rivers in the DPS, and nearly so in the Columbia River. Major threats to southern eulachon include climate change impacts on ocean and freshwater habitat, by-catch in offshore shrimp trawl fisheries, changes in downstream flow timing and intensity owing to dams and water diversions, and predation. These threats, together with large declines in abundance, indicate that the southern DPS of eulachon is at moderate risk of extinction throughout all of its range.

We develop a state-dependent decision-making model to address the spatial allocation of effort in an Australian tuna longline fishery. We assume that fishers have an economic objective in deciding where to fish, but that decisions in any period are also influenced by the remaining quota held at the time of the decision. Key features of the model include endogenous price dynamics, a moving stock and a competitive pool of different vessel types operating from different port locations. We utilize this model to illustrate fleet responses to marine reserves and limits on fishing effort. The results illustrate that the model framework provides advantages over statistically based models in that decisions made in response to the imposition of a reserve are not consistent with a proportional reallocation of effort. Rather, the stochastic dynamic model yielded an overall profit level of ~4% higher relative to scenarios with no reserve. Incorporating the opportunity cost of a quota into the model resulted in an optimal utilization of effort, in which effort was concentrated in time periods and locations yielding maximized profit. Under a low level of effort relative to the season length, the model indicated an overall profit level 43% greater than the highest obtained when the same level of effort was applied solely within any given quarter of the season. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Assessing opportunity and relocation costs of marine protected areas   using a behavioural model of longline fleet dynamics",0

Pieces of the model have been suggested in the literature, and these pieces are formalized here realizing the current operating parameters of the global seafood industry. The derived pull-threshold model assumes that if producers exceed the threshold, there is no incentive to improve while if too far below, improvement is most likely beyond technical or financial means. Thus, a single certification is only a marginal solution to the larger picture. Those producers immediately below the certification threshold are within range or 'pull' of the threshold to improve as a result of certification. Results from a single threshold model applied to compliance data indicated that a maximum improvement of 12.5%, achieved when the pull was the greatest and the threshold was at the lower end of the impact distribution. When impacts were continuous (e.g. escapes in aquaculture), greater improvement was observed with thresholds targeting the producers at the higher end of the impact distribution. In all cases, improvement was maximized with a triple threshold model, indicating that single threshold scenario will not drive the greatest movement towards environmental improvement throughout the industry.

Many different species are used globally for the production of FMFO, but little concern has been given to the divergent environmental and ecological impacts of FMFO products based on species, ecosystem and fishing gear used in their capture. We evaluated the variable environmental performance of FMFO products from a wide range of fisheries whose products are either primarily intended for reduction or whose by-products are redirected to reduction. Assessed fisheries accounted for 44% of global reduction fishery landings in 2014. Analysis was conducted on the basis of two measures: the carbon footprint (i.e., greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions) and the marine footprint (i.e., primary production required [PPR]). We found large differences between the impacts of FMFO products across the 18 reduction fisheries examined. Cumulatively, we estimate that reduction fisheries emitted 4.6 million tonnes of CO2-e GHGs in 2014, and appropriated over 4% of primary production in some ecosystems, demonstrating a non-trivial impact. As demand for aquafeeds grow, the sustainable sourcing of raw material inputs will be of great importance.

Fisheries and marine ecosystems constitute a difficult application of this bio-economic challenge. Many experts and scientists advocate an ecosystem approach to manage marine socio-ecosystems for their sustainability and resilience. However, the ways by which to operationalize ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) remain poorly specified. We propose a specific methodological framework—viability modelling—to do so. We show how viability modelling can be applied using four contrasted case-studies: two small-scale fisheries in South America and Pacific and two larger-scale fisheries in Europe and Australia. The four fisheries are analysed using the same modelling framework, structured around a set of common methods, indicators and scenarios. The calibrated models are dynamic, multispecies and multifleet and account for various sources of uncertainty. A multicriteria evaluation is used to assess the scenarios’ outcomes over a long time horizon with different constraints based on ecological, social and economic reference points. Results show to what extent the bio-economic and ecosystem risks associated with the adoption of status quo strategies are relatively high and challenge the implementation of EBFM. In contrast, strategies called ecoviability or co-viability strategies, that aim at satisfying the viability constraints, reduce significantly these ecological and economic risks and promote EBFM. The gains associated with those ecoviability strategies, however, decrease with the intensity of regulations imposed on these fisheries.","Ecoviability for ecosystem-based fisheries management",1

We explain that the most devastating, pervasive and systemic threats are rooted in official policies, particularly unsustainable activities (e.g. hydropower, water diversion, mining, aquaculture, agriculture and fishing), poor management/conservation (e.g. fish stocking and passages) and harmful legislation (e.g. poor licensing, non-native species).

Towed bottom-fishing gears typically kill 20–50 per cent of the benthic invertebrates in their path, depending on gear type, substrate and vulnerability of particular taxa. Particularly vulnerable are epifaunal species, which stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for benthic invertebrates. To identify the habitats, fisheries or target species most likely to be affected, we review evidence of the indirect effects of bottom fishing on fish production. Recent studies have found differences in the diets of certain species in relation to bottom fishing intensity, thereby linking demersal fish to their benthic habitats at spatial scales of ~10 km. Bottom fishing affects diet composition and prey quality rather than the amount of prey consumed; scavenging of discarded by-catch makes only a small contribution to yearly food intake. Flatfish may benefit from light trawling levels on sandy seabeds, while higher-intensity trawling on more vulnerable habitats has a negative effect. Models suggest that reduction in the carrying capacity of habitats by bottom fishing could lead to lower equilibrium yield and a lower level of fishing mortality to obtain maximum yield. Trawling effort is patchily distributed – small fractions of fishing grounds are heavily fished, while large fractions are lightly fished or unfished. This patchiness, coupled with the foraging behaviour of demersal fish, may mitigate the indirect effects of bottom fishing on fish productivity. Current research attempts to scale up these localized effects to the population level.","Indirect effects of bottom fishing on the productivity of marine fish",0

We defined success as increased or maintained abundance or biomass, reductions in fishing mortality or improvements in population status. Because the literature only covered a narrow set of biological factors, we also conducted an expert elicitation to create a typology of broader fishery characteristics, enabling conditions and design considerations that affect performance. The literature suggested that the most commonly used management tool in a region was often the most successful, although the scale of success varied. Management tools were more often deemed successful when used in combination, particularly pairings of tools that controlled fishing mortality or effort with spatial management. Examples of successful combinations were the use of catch limits with quotas and limited entry, and marine protected areas with effort restrictions. The most common factors associated with inadequate biological performance were ‘structural’ issues, including poor design or implementation. The expert-derived typologies revealed strong local leadership, high community involvement and governance capacity as common factors of success across management tool categories (i.e. input, output and technical measures), but the degree of importance varied.

These trade-offs are compounded by interacting species and fisheries at the ecosystem level. Weighing objectives becomes increasingly challenging when managers have to consider opposing objectives from different stakeholders. An alternative to weighing incomparable and conflicting objectives is to focus on win–wins until Pareto efficiency is achieved: a state from which it is impossible to improve with respect to any objective without regressing at least one other. We investigate the ecosystem-level efficiency of fisheries in five large marine ecosystems (LMEs) with respect to yield and an aggregate measure of ecosystem impact using a novel calibration of size-based ecosystem models. We estimate that fishing patterns in three LMEs (North Sea, Barents Sea and Benguela Current) are nearly efficient with respect to long-term yield and ecosystem impact and that efficiency has improved over the last 30 years. In two LMEs (Baltic Sea and North East US Continental Shelf), fishing is inefficient and win–wins remain available. We additionally examine the efficiency of North Sea and Baltic Sea fisheries with respect to economic rent and ecosystem impact, finding both to be inefficient but steadily improving. Our results suggest the following: (i) a broad and encouraging trend towards ecosystem-level efficiency of fisheries; (ii) that ecosystem-scale win–wins, especially with respect to conservation and profits, may still be common; and (iii) single-species assessment approaches may overestimate the availability of win–wins by failing to account for trade-offs across interacting species.","Efficiency of fisheries is increasing at the ecosystem level",0

Ground story vegetation structure and composition in pine savannas change rapidly following fire such that categorical (i.e., burned vs. unburned) habitat selection analyses does not depict the fine scaled time-dependent relationships; therefore, we analyzed turkey selection of savanna on a seasonal and continuous scale.

Hens also selected hardwood drains whereas gobblers demonstrated proportional use of these habitats.

Understanding the relative importance of the broad effects of forestry practices versus specific habitat variables for wildlife may help managers balance multiple forest management objectives and potentially adjust forestry practices to better conserve biodiversity. We compared the relative importance of experimental timber harvest treatments (clearcutting, thinning to remove undesirable tree species) to habitat variables (coarse down wood, herbaceous vegetation, leaf litter) for captures of reptiles in central Missouri, USA for two years post-harvest. We also used drift fences along the edges between uncut control forest and clearcut to detect changes in movements between treatments after timber harvest, which is one potential mechanism for differences in captures among timber harvest treatments. We found that habitat variables best predicted captures of small snakes, while both habitat and timber harvest treatment predicted lizard captures. Two lizard taxa (Plestiodon spp., Sceloporus undulatus) had higher captures in clearcuts than in the no harvest control, which is consistent with studies across the southeastern United States. Plestiodon spp. showed significantly more movements into clearcuts from control forest than in the opposite direction, demonstrating that higher captures in clearcuts were at least in part due to immigration from adjacent forested areas. Small snakes and Sceloporus undulatus captures were higher in areas with more coarse down wood and higher herbaceous vegetation cover, which were associated with the clearcut plots. These results for small snakes are consistent with another study in Missouri, but in contrast to two from South Carolina, indicating that there may be regional differences in the response of small snakes to forestry practices.

We present a population projection for the emperor penguin population of Terre Adélie, Antarctica, by linking demographic models (stage-structured, seasonal, nonlinear, two-sex matrix population models) to sea ice forecasts from an ensemble of IPCC climate models. Based on maximum likelihood capture-mark-recapture analysis, we find that seasonal sea ice concentration anomalies (SIC a) affect adult survival and breeding success. Demographic models show that both deterministic and stochastic population growth rates are maximized at intermediate values of annual SIC a, because neither the complete absence of sea ice, nor heavy and persistent sea ice, would provide satisfactory conditions for the emperor penguin. We show that under some conditions the stochastic growth rate is positively affected by the variance in SIC a. We identify an ensemble of five general circulation climate models whose output closely matches the historical record of sea ice concentration in Terre Adélie. The output of this ensemble is used to produce stochastic forecasts of SIC a, which in turn drive the population model. Uncertainty is included by incorporating multiple climate models and by a parametric bootstrap procedure that includes parameter uncertainty due to both model selection and estimation error. The median of these simulations predicts a decline of the Terre Adélie emperor penguin population of 81% by the year 2100. We find a 43% chance of an even greater decline, of 90% or more. The uncertainty in population projections reflects large differences among climate models in their forecasts of future sea ice conditions. One such model predicts population increases over much of the century, but overall, the ensemble of models predicts that population declines are far more likely than population increases.

We carried out replicated experimental management of brushtail possums, Trichosurus vulpecula, in three areas of native forest in New Zealand. Each area included a site that had extensive possum control for 10 years, prior to and during the 5-year study, and a paired site with no control. We measured indices of possum browse on c.2400 possum 'preferred' and c.1200 'non-preferred' trees, and an index of possum abundance, at the beginning and end of the experiment. Extensive control was effective in reducing possum browse on preferred tree species. Reductions in browse led to increased foliage cover and decreased probability of tree mortality. The probability of browse on an individual tree decreased with increasing amounts of possum-preferred foliage on nearby trees but increased with tree size and with increasing levels of browse on nearby trees. At one site where possum control ceased prematurely, foliage cover decreased, reducing benefits from earlier control. Synthesis and applications.

We developed models of traffic volume for an entire road network in south-western Alberta, Canada, and documented for the first time the response of grizzly bears Ursus arctos L to a wide range of traffic levels. Traffic patterns caused a clear behavioural shift in grizzly bears, with increased use of areas near roads and movement across roads during the night when traffic was low. Bears selected areas near roads travelled by fewer than 20 vehicles per day and were more likely to cross these roads. Bears avoided roads receiving moderate traffic (20-100 vehicles per day) and strongly avoided high-use roads (>100 vehicles per day) at all times. Synthesis and applications. Grizzly bear responses to traffic caused a departure from typical behavioural patterns, with bears in our study being largely nocturnal.

Their effective conservation requires predictions of sensitivity and exposure to fishing mortality, but such predictions are hard to make when the population dynamics of most of these species have not been described. We present a method for assessing sensitivity and conservation management reference points using widely available life-history data. The method allows the sensitivity of all fish species in a community to be assessed in relation to conservation- and yield-based fishery reference points. Knowledge of sensitivity is used to (i) rank species by sensitivity, (ii) conduct a risk assessment to identify species potentially vulnerable to current fishing pressure and (iii) examine potential trade-offs between fishery catches and the conservation status of sensitive species. The method is applied to the Celtic Sea bottom-dwelling fish community. For the species present, conservation threshold fishing mortalities ranged from 0·05 per year for the most sensitive large elasmobranchs to over 1 per year for small teleosts. The assessment predicts that current levels of fishing mortality may place all the elasmobranchs and over a quarter of the teleosts below conservation reference points. Depending on the relative mortality rates affecting commercially targeted species and species of conservation concern, up to 65% of the potential yield-per-recruit of commercially important species may have to be forgone to reduce fishing mortality below conservation limit reference points for the most sensitive species. Synthesis and applications. The method presented provides a clear objective procedure to construct ranked species sensitivity lists that can inform management, monitoring and research. The Celtic Sea case study demonstrated that limiting fishing pressure on key commercial stocks to meet fisheries production targets may be insufficient to guarantee the persistence of more sensitive species. Management actions that effectively decouple the mortality rates on commercial species and 'conservation' species are likely to be required to make progress in relation to conservation objectives.

These findings are consistent with those from small-scale experimental studies and indicate that deer-related habitat modification may be affecting some bird species on far larger scales than previously appreciated. Mainly through their effects on understorey vegetation, high deer populations are now likely to be affecting woodland biodiversity over large parts of lowland England and deer management plans, involving integrated exclusion and culling of deer, need to be co-ordinated on large scales. It is suggested that such management plans could most usefully target areas that still support relatively high populations of species that are sensitive to deer. Knowledge about the form of relationships between deer abundance and habitat quality for birds and other biodiversity is an important knowledge gap that needs to be addressed if sound, collaborative deer management plans are to be developed. © 2011 The Authors.

However, data sets available to management authorities for resource selection and connectivity analyses are often highly limited and fragmentary. As a result, measuring connectivity is challenging, and often poorly integrated within conservation planning and wildlife management. To exacerbate the challenge, scale-dependent resource use makes inference across scales problematic, resource use is often modelled in areas where the species is not present, and connectivity is typically measured using a source-to-sink approach, erroneously assuming animals possess predefined destinations. Here, we used a large carnivore, the leopard Panthera pardus, to characterise resource use and landscape connectivity across a vast, biodiverse region of southern Africa. Using a range of data sets to counter data deficiencies inherent in carnivore management, we overcame methodological limitations by employing occupancy modelling and resource selection functions across three orders of selection, and estimated landscape-scale habitat connectivity – independent of a priori source and sink locations – using circuit theory. We evaluated whether occupancy modelling on its own was capable of accurately informing habitat connectivity, and identified conservation priorities necessary for applied management. We detected markedly different scale-dependent relationships across all selection orders. Our multi-data, multi-scale approach accurately predicted resource use across multiple scales and demonstrates how management authorities can more suitably utilise fragmentary data sets. We further developed an unbiased landscape-scale depiction of habitat connectivity, and identified key linkages in need of targeted management. We did not find support for the use of occupancy modelling as a proxy for landscape-scale habitat connectivity and further caution its use within a management context. Synthesis and applications. Maintaining habitat connectivity remains a fundamental component of wildlife management and conservation, yet data to inform these biological and ecological processes are often scarce. We present a robust approach that incorporates multi-scale fragmentary data sets (e.g. mortality data, permit data, sightings data), routinely collected by management authorities, to inform wildlife management and land-use planning. We recommend that management authorities employ a multi-data, multi-scale connectivity approach – as we present here – to identify management units at risk of low connectivity.","Cats, connectivity and conservation: incorporating data sets and   integrating scales for wildlife management",0

Lack of meaningful connectivity metrics is likely leading to inadequate representation of important biological connections in reserve networks. Identifying patterns in landscape connectivity can, theoretically, improve the design of conservation areas. We used a network model to estimate seascape connectivity for coral reef-associated fishes in a subtropical bay in Australia. The model accounted for two scales of connectivity: (i) within mosaics at a local scale and (ii) among these mosaics at a regional scale. Connections among mosaics were modelled using estimations of post-larval small and intermediate movement distances represented by home ranges of two fish species. Modelled connectivity patterns were assessed with existing data on fish diversity. For fishes with intermediate home ranges (0–6 km), connectivity [quantified by the index Probability of Connectivity (dPC)] explained 51–60% of species diversity. At smaller home ranges (0–1 km), species diversity was associated closely with intramosaic connectivity quantified by the index dPCintra. Mosaics and their region-wide connections were ranked for their contribution to overall seascape connectivity and compared against current positions and boundaries of reserves. Our matching shows that only three of the 10 most important mosaics are at least partly encompassed within a reserve, and only a single important regional connection lies within a reserve. Synthesis and applications. Notwithstanding its formal recognition in reserve planning, connectivity is rarely accounted for in practice, mainly because suitable metrics of connectivity are not available in planning phases. Here, we show how a network analysis can be effectively used in conservation planning by identifying biological connectivity inside and outside present reserve networks. Our results demonstrate clearly that connectivity is insufficiently represented within a reserve network. We also provide evidence of key pathways in need of protection to avoid nullifying the benefits of protecting key reefs. The guiding principle of protecting connections among habitats can be achieved more effectively in future, by formally incorporating our findings into the decision framework.","Prioritising seascape connectivity in conservation using network   analysis",0

Set against this background is the global decline of amphibians, with up to 40% of species facing extinction from multiple additive threats. Despite these disturbing figures, it is currently unclear how increasing fire frequency may impact the long-term persistence of frog populations. Following a severe wildfire in south-eastern Australia in 2009, field surveys indicated healthy tree frog populations. However, the 2009 fire had significant impacts on genetic diversity, including increased levels of inbreeding and declines in effective population size. Using stochastic population modelling under a range of fire-frequency scenarios, we demonstrate that amphibian populations in fire-prone environments may be increasingly vulnerable to extinction, particularly where rates of immigration are low. Synthesis and applications. This study of amphibian population genetics before and after a major wildfire emphasizes the importance of integrating both ecological and genetic data into population models. This will help managers make more appropriate conservation decisions regarding fire management of natural environments, especially those containing threatened populations.

While both the foraging activity and functional diversity of birds are enhanced by multiscale habitat heterogeneity, little is known about how these relationships may influence avian top-down control of insects. Specifically, interactive effects of bird community structure and habitat heterogeneity on pest control across spatial scales have rarely been explored. We sampled bird communities and measured avian predation on plasticine model prey, as a proxy for lepidopteran pest control, in 20 vineyards of south-western France. Vineyards differed both in sward heterogeneity at the local scale and amount of surrounding semi-natural habitats at the landscape scale. Functional diversity metrics and community-weighted mean traits were computed for bird communities based on a species–trait table including diet, foraging method, nesting site, migration strategy, laying date, home range size, clutch size and body mass. We used mixed models to test for the interacting effects of habitat heterogeneity and bird functional diversity on avian predation rates of plasticine prey. Contrary to expectations, bird functional diversity decreased with landscape-scale heterogeneity, but was higher in vineyards managed with heterogeneous sward structures. In contrast, foliage-gleaning insectivores were more abundant in landscapes supporting more semi-natural habitats, suggesting an increase in their contribution to pest control along the landscape heterogeneity gradient. Accordingly, we found that avian predation on plasticine prey increased with bird functional evenness both in more heterogeneous vineyards at the local scale and in landscape mosaics supporting more semi-natural habitats. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that habitat heterogeneity at both local and landscape scales influenced avian insectivory in vineyard agroecosystems by interacting with bird community structure. It provides important insights for ecological intensification in vineyards, pointing out that management options need to be adapted to both the functional composition of local bird communities and landscape context. We suggest that both on-field and off-field management can be used to enhance natural pest control services provided by birds in vineyards, especially by favouring sward heterogeneity and patches of semi-natural habitats within large vineyard stands at the landscape scale.","Avian pest control in vineyards is driven by interactions between bird   functional diversity and landscape heterogeneity",1

We conducted a 3-year study (2007-2009) to determine the influence of CRP on fawn ecology during a time of declining CRP enrollment. We captured and radiocollared 81 fawn white-tailed deer during 15 May to 15 June 2007-2009 in north-central South Dakota, collected 6,505 locations, and documented 70 summer home ranges. Mean summer home ranges increased temporally during 2007-2009 (P<0.001) and corresponded to a 41% loss of CRP grasslands in the area (2.3% loss in land cover and approx. 21% loss in cover habitat in the study area) over the duration of the study. Additionally, mean movement between daily locations increased (P<0.001) from 2007 to 2009. Analysis of covariance models indicated that change in CRP influenced home-range size, and change in CRP and wheat influenced daily movement. Smaller home ranges and reduced movements were associated with greater quantity of CRP available to fawns, and increased movements were associated with more acreage of wheat available to fawns. Fawns shifted resource selection during the summer at a mean age ranging from 48.8 days to 58.6 days, and this shift was associated with height of corn (83-87cm). During early summer, fawns consistently selected for CRP; selection of wheat progressed temporally from avoidance in 2007 to selection in 2009. During late summer, fawns consistently selected for corn habitat and used CRP at least in proportion to its availability. Reduction in CRP-grasslands seemed to increase fawn home-range size and daily movements and, influenced change in resource selection to wheat. Current legislation mandates continued decrease in CRP enrollment and concomitant increase in the planting of corn for ethanol production.

Specifically, we analyzed the isotopic composition of hair from bears known a priori to be food-conditioned or non-food-conditioned and used these data to predict whether bears with an unknown management status were food-conditioned (FC) or non-food-conditioned (NFC). We used a stable isotope mixing model to estimate the proportional contribution of natural foods (plants and animals) versus human food in the diets of FC bears. We then used results from both analyses to evaluate proactive (population-level) and reactive (individual-level) human-bear management, and discussed new metrics to evaluate the overall human-bear management program in Yosemite. Our results indicated that 19 out of 145 (13%) unknown bears sampled from 2005 to 2007 were food-conditioned. The proportion of human food in the diets of known FC bears likely declined from 2001-2003 to 2005-2007, suggesting proactive management was successful in reducing the amount of human food available to bears. In contrast, reactive management was not successful in changing the management status of known FC bears to NFC bears, or in reducing the contribution of human food to the diets of FC bears. Nine known FC bears were recaptured on 14 occasions from 2001 to 2007; all bears were classified as FC during subsequent recaptures, and human-bear management did not reduce the amount of human food in the diets of FC bears.

During 1993-2000, 617 radio-marked females provided information about brood habitat use and duckling survival on 27 sites in prairie Canada. We contrasted a priori and exploratory models that incorporated effects of upland, wetland, weather, female, and brood-related variables on duckling survival rates. Survival was highest for ducklings when a greater proportion of their surrounding landscape (i.e., within a 500-m radius buffer around the brood) was comprised of wetlands characterized by a central expanse of open water and a peripheral ring of flooded emergent vegetation. Cold and wet weather in the first week of life resulted in lower duckling survival.

The golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) is a neotropical migratory bird that was listed as federally endangered in 1990 because of threats related to loss and fragmentation of its woodland habitat. Since listing, abundance estimates for the species have mainly relied on localized population studies on public lands and qualitative-based methods. Our goal was to estimate breeding population size of male warblers using a predictive model based on metrics for patches of woodland habitat throughout the species' breeding range. We first conducted occupancy surveys to determine range-wide distribution. We then conducted standard point-count surveys on a subset of the initial sampling locations to estimate density of males. Mean observed patch-specific density was 0.23 males/ha (95% CI = 0.197-0.252, n = 301). We modeled the relationship between patch-specific density of males and woodland patch characteristics (size and landscape composition) and predicted patch occupancy. The probability of patch occupancy, derived from a model that used patch size and landscape composition as predictor variables while addressing effects of spatial relatedness, best predicted patch-specific density. We predicted patch-specific densities as a function of occupancy probability and estimated abundance of male warblers across 63,616 woodland patches accounting for 1.678 million ha of potential warbler habitat. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, our approach yielded a range-wide male warbler population estimate of 263,339 (95% CI: 223,927-302,620).

Populations of red-legged partridges in Spain have decreased in recent decades, and releases of farm-bred partridges to improve short-term availability are increasingly common. We used questionnaires and bird surveys to assess whether harvest was related to availability of wild partridges or intensity of farm-bred partridge releases. We studied 50 hunting estates, including 6 administratively labeled as intensive (with few numerical and temporal restrictions to releases). In addition, we considered hunting pressure (number of huntersá - hunting days/km 2) and habitat as explanatory variables in the analyses. In intensive estates, annual harvest was exclusively related to release intensity, indicating that in these estates hunting is detached from natural resources and approaches an industrial activity based on external inputs. In non-intensive estates, harvest was affected by wild stock availability, walked-up shooting pressure, and habitat (greater harvest in estates with more Mediterranean shrubland). In these estates, releases did not increase annual harvest, and can be considered an inefficient practice. Additionally, the relationship between abundance estimates and harvest disappeared in estates with low partridge abundance estimates, suggesting possibilities for overharvesting in a large proportion of estates. Increasing the abundance of wild red-legged partridge through techniques like habitat management, and improving the adjustment of harvest to availability, may be a good strategy to increase long-term harvest in non-intensive estates. Additionally, Government and managers must create ways to segregate and label the estates where only wild red-legged partridges are managed from those where releases are used, to reduce ecological costs of management decisions. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

Our objective was to quantify neonate survival rates and causes of mortality at the United States Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina to directly evaluate degree of predation in this deer population. From 2006 to 2009, we radio-monitored 91 neonates captured with the aid of vaginal implant transmitters in pregnant adult females and opportunistic searches. Overall Kaplan-Meier survival rate to 16 weeks of age was 0.230 (95% CI=0.155-0.328), and it varied little among years. Our best-fitting model estimated survival at 0.220 (95% CI=0.144-0.320). This model included a quadratic time trend variable (lowest survival rate during the first week of life and increasing to near 1.000 around week 10), and Julian date of birth (survival probability declining as date of birth increased). Predation by coyotes was the most frequent cause of death among the 70 monitored neonates that died, definitively accounting for 37% of all mortalities and potentially accounting for as much as 80% when also including probable coyote predation. Predation by bobcats (Felis rufus) accounted for 7% (definitive) to 9% (including probable bobcat predation) of mortalities. The level of coyote-induced mortality we observed is consistent with the low recruitment rates exhibited in the SRS deer population since establishment of coyotes at the site. If representative of recruitment rates across South Carolina, current harvest levels appear unsustainable. This understanding is consistent with the recent declining trend in the statewide deer population. The effects of coyote predation on recruitment should be considered when setting harvest goals, regardless of whether local deer population size is currently above or below desired levels, because coyotes can substantially reduce fawn recruitment.

Because the natural mortality rate of adult grizzly bears is 1–2% and lower than was estimated when sustainable human-caused mortality targets were developed, estimated sustainable kill rates are 4–10%, and generally higher than the 4–6% used in British Columbia. We estimated that males have been 3–4 times more vulnerable to being killed by hunters than females, yet males dominate the kill at all ages and the proportion of males increased with age, which is opposite of what is predicted for a heavily hunted population. The average age of female and male grizzly bears killed by hunters increased from 7.1 years and 7.4 years, respectively, in the 1980s to 7.7 years and 8.7 years, respectively, in the 2000s. An average of 107.4 females and 204.9 males per cohort born between 1977 and 1990 were eventually killed by people and recorded, suggesting that many more females than males died for unknown reasons. There have been more population inventories of grizzly bears in British Columbia than in any other jurisdiction. The average density estimate of 21 inventories in hunted areas without salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in British Columbia (31.2 bears/1,000 km2) was as high as or higher than nearby unhunted areas. The case studies had the highest kill densities or among the highest kill rates in the province and hunting targets were commonly exceeded and seasons closed or the hunter kill target reduced. Although population inventories in these areas found moderate or even high densities of bears, some are now in decline. Hunter kill data from declining populations had a high proportion of males and these were older, demonstrating that these indices of kill rates are sometimes unreliable.

Over 5 years, we measured ranging behavior and breeding propensity of marbled murrelets in Washington, USA where murrelets are considered threatened. Our primary objective was to compare space use and breeding by murrelets in Washington with those from other regions and where the species is not considered threatened. We radio tracked 157 murrelets from 2004 to 2008. Median marine 95% kernel ranges were 487 km2 (Formula presented.) and larger than those reported for non-threatened populations in Alaska, USA in other studies. Ranges computed from minimum convex polygons (MCPs; median = 404 km2; (Formula presented) were on average similar to those reported for threatened populations in California, USA, although larger than those reported for Alaska. Distances traveled between consecutive marine telemetry locations were greater than reported previously in Alaska. Variation in movements in our study were not associated with oceanographic conditions although appeared greater for murrelets captured along the Pacific Coast compared to those occupying interior marine waters in the Salish Sea. Twenty individuals (12.7%) attempted to breed in our study, and we estimated breeding propensity was 13.1–20.0%. This is the lowest breeding propensity reported for a population of murrelets to date. For breeders, nest-sea commuting distances were greater than reported previously, with 4 breeders traveling farther than the previously reported maximum of 125 km. The low breeding propensity, large marine ranges, and long nest-sea commutes in this study may point to poor-quality marine habitat in Washington compared to other parts of the murrelet's range. In combination with reported declines in terrestrial nesting habitat from other studies, this indicates that additional management is needed to improve murrelet breeding habitat in Washington.

The migratory Fortymile caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herd in Alaska reached a low of approximately 6,000 caribou during 1973–1975. To regain peak numbers of approximately 50,000 caribou estimated in the 1960s, stakeholder groups gained approval for conservative harvest rates (1973–2013) and periods of restricted nonlethal (1998–2004) and lethal wolf (Canis lupus) control (2005–2013). We studied demography of the herd using radio-telemetry during 1990–2014, when herd size increased from about 22,000 to 52,000 caribou. Parturition rates in the early 1990s were among the highest reported, but parturition rates of primiparous females subsequently declined to a level indicating resource-limitation as caribou numbers approached and then exceeded 50,000. This and companion studies documented several other cautionary signals to an eventual decline, including declining October calf weights, early summer movement off the alpine and subalpine tundra to lower elevation spruce–moss taiga, relatively high caribou densities, a nearly 40-year history of increasing caribou numbers, and a return to previous peak numbers. We studied mortality of calves and older females during the 4 years before wolf control and the first 5 years of nonlethal wolf control. During those 9 years, annual mortality rates averaged 54% for calves and 9% for adult females. We detected no convincing support for decreased wolf predation during nonlethal control. We also detected no support for increased caribou survival during nonlethal or lethal wolf control. Based on counts of caribou during summer aggregations using a total search photocensus technique, rate of herd increase (<U+03BB>r) was negligible (<U+03BB>r = 1.00) during 1990–1995, highest during the 3 years immediately before nonlethal wolf control (<U+03BB>r = 1.11, 1995–1998), moderate during nonlethal wolf control (<U+03BB>r = 1.07, 1998–2003), and low during the period that included the first 5 years of lethal wolf control (<U+03BB>r = 1.02, 2003–2010). We combined observed cause of death with the 9 annual modeled starting populations (all newborn calves and adults) and estimated that wolves killed 10–15% of the populations annually, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) killed 4–7%, other predators killed 2–4%, nonpredation factors killed 1–2%, and hunters killed =2%. Wolves killed 5–9% of the annual populations as calves and 5–6% as adults. In retrospect, nonlethal wolf control efforts were too localized to decrease wolf numbers (e.g., adjacent untreated wolf packs reached max. mean numbers). Lethal wolf control efforts had only seasonal and localized effects on wolf numbers. It is important that stakeholders focus on describing a preferred, sustainable herd size, or nutritional status and proceed toward managing this increasing herd in a sustainable manner because, when ungulates overshoot carrying capacity, the effects of high density, adverse weather, and increased predation can have synergistic negative effects on prey numbers and long-lasting negative effects on sustainable yields, contrary to the intended purpose of the wolf control programs. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","Demography of an Increasing Caribou Herd With Restricted Wolf Control",0

Dispersing wolves from Canada naturally recolonized Montana and first denned there in 1986. In 1995 and 1996, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service reintroduced 66 wolves into central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park. By 2008, there were =1,655 wolves in =217 packs, including 95 breeding pairs in the NRM. From 1993–2008, we captured and radio-collared 1,681 wolves and documented 297 radio-collared wolves dispersing as lone individuals. We monitored dispersing wolves to determine their pack characteristics (i.e., pack size and surrounding pack density) before and after dispersal, their reproductive success, and eventual fate. We calculated summary statistics for characteristics of wolf dispersal (i.e., straight-line distance, age, time of year, sex ratio, reproduction, and survival), and we tested these characteristics for differences between sexes and age groups. Approximately, 10% of the known wolf population dispersed annually. The sex ratio of dispersals favored males (169 M, 128 F), but fewer dispersed males reproduced (28%, n = 47) than females (42%, n = 54). Fifty-nine percent of all dispersers of known age were adults (n = 156), 37% were yearlings (n = 99), and 4% were pups (n = 10). Mean age at dispersal for males (32.8 months) was not significantly different (P = 0.88) than for females (32.1 months). Yellowstone National Park had a significant positive effect on dispersal rate. Pack density in a wolf's natal population had a negative effect on dispersal rate when the entire NRM population was considered. The mean NRM pack size (6.9) from 1993 to 2008 was smaller than the mean size of packs (10.0) from which wolves dispersed during that time period (P < 0.001); however, pack size was not in our most supported model. Dispersals occurred throughout the year but generally increased in the fall and peaked in January. The mean duration of all dispersals was 5.5 months. Radio-collared wolves dispersed between Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming to other adjacent states, and between the United States and Canada throughout the study. Mean straight-line distance between starting and ending points for dispersing males (98.1 km) was not significantly different than females (87.7 km; P = 0.11). Ten wolves (3.4%) dispersed distances >300 km. On average, dispersal distance decreased later in the study (P = 0.006). Sex, survival rate in the natal population, start date, dispersal distance, and direction were not significant predictors of dispersal rate or successful dispersal. Wolves that formed new packs were >11 times more likely to reproduce than those that joined packs and surrounding pack density had a negative effect on successful dispersal. Dispersal behavior seems to be innate in sexually mature wolves and thereby assures that genetic diversity will remain high and help conserve the NRM wolf population. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","Wolf dispersal in the Rocky Mountains, Western United States: 1993-2008",0

These negative interactions might be reduced with more understanding of individual variation in the use of residential areas and if attractants were better predicted by residents and targeted for securement or removal. We fitted 19 urban coyotes with global positioning system (GPS) collars (11 healthy, 8 with sarcoptic mange [Sarcoptes scabiei]) and compared their selection for residential areas at different times of day. We also identified 173 clusters of GPS locations (representing foraging and bedding sites) and paired them with available sites to measure selection for anthropogenic food, shelter, and visual cover. Seventeen of 19 coyotes avoided residential areas in general, but lesser avoidance of residential areas occurred in animals that used these areas during the day. Backyards selected by coyotes were 66.7 times less likely to have fences, 22.2 times more likely to contain anthropogenic food, and had 3.3 times as much visual cover than available yards. Diseased coyotes were 9 times more likely than healthy animals to select for yards with anthropogenic food. Our results suggest that coarse measurements of habitat selection via land cover classes may underestimate the attraction to wildlife of particular features in residential areas.

Some species preferentially breed in ephemeral ponds, which can provide benefits for larvae. An alternative strategy used by adults to increase offspring survival is to detect aquatic predators and avoid them when selecting breeding sites. We investigated whether either of these types of breeding site selection are contributing to the negative correlation between the distributions of tadpoles of the threatened green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) and the introduced eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) in Sydney, Australia. From 2003 to 2012 we drained ponds to temporarily remove gambusia and examined the effect of removal on the numbers of male, female, and juvenile frogs, and tadpoles. We found that males preferentially selected fish-free ponds as breeding sites. In addition, the removal of gambusia increased tadpole abundance to over 140 times that of an undrained pond. Pond draining did not influence female or juvenile abundances. The ability to detect and avoid gambusia may be mitigating the effect of predation to a certain extent. We conclude that pond draining to remove exotic fish is an effective strategy that can be used to greatly increase the reproductive success of this and potentially other threatened amphibian species in the presence of exotic predators. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.","Removal of an exotic fish influences amphibian breeding site selection",0

We contrasted contemporary body mass of brant goslings and forage biomass in brood-rearing habitats that were shared by all species, with measures obtained on, and near the CRD in the 1990s, prior to the establishment of snow goose nesting colonies in the area. Body mass of brant goslings recaptured between 25 and 32 days of age had not changed over the past 2 decades, despite an influx of snow geese, and increases in populations of brant and white-fronted geese. At 30 days of age, body mass of brant goslings on the CRD was 100–400 g heavier than for brant goslings of the same age on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD), Alaska. Contemporary biomass of grazed Carex subspathacea on CRD brood-rearing areas was comparable to the 1990s and was 2–4 times greater than for the same plant community on the YKD. Historical data on growth of snow goose goslings were not available for the CRD. However, average body mass of 34-day-old snow goose goslings was >230 g heavier than for conspecifics of the same age in the Hudson Bay region. We conclude that the establishment of nesting snow geese on the CRD has not negatively affected brant gosling growth, and that recent population increases of all species have likely not been constrained by forage availability on brood-rearing areas. Barring demographic changes elsewhere in their annual cycles, we predict that goose populations will continue to increase in northern Alaska.

We gathered data on train collisions with wild ungulates throughout Poland between 2012 and 2015 from Polish Railways Polskie Koleje Panstwowe SA. We used generalized additive mixed models to investigate whether the number of collisions changed over time. The number of wildlife-train collisions varied depending on time of year. Most collisions occurred in autumn when animals form winter herds and migrate to and stay in winter refugia. The fewest collisions occurred in summer during breeding season. For all species except red deer, the number of collisions was significantly lower during weekends compared to weekdays. The distribution of collisions with regard to time of day was significantly different from simulated uniform random distribution, with peaks before dawn and after dusk, which reflect activity peaks of ungulates. During the day, the probability of collision was lower, with only single events observed between 0800 and 1600. We observed another collision-free period after midnight until 0400, probably because train traffic was minimal during this period. Most train collisions with ungulates took place in relatively narrow time windows in terms of time of year and time of day (i.e., 50% of the recorded cases took place in ~17% of the total time observed).

While new international policy and assessment processes such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) recognize the importance of an increasingly global, quantitative and comprehensive approach to biodiversity protection, most insights are still focused on a single facet of biodiversity - species. Here we broaden the focus and provide an evaluation of how much of the world's species, functional and phylogenetic diversity of birds and mammals is currently protected and the scope for improvement. We show that the large existing gaps in the coverage for each facet of diversity could be remedied by a slight expansion of protected areas: an additional 5% of the land has the potential to more than triple the protected range of species or phylogenetic or functional units. Further, the same areas are often priorities for multiple diversity facets and for both taxa. However, we find that the choice of conservation strategy has a fundamental effect on outcomes. It is more difficult (that is, requires more land) to maximize basic representation of the global biodiversity pool than to maximize local diversity. Overall, species and phylogenetic priorities are more similar to each other than they are to functional priorities, and priorities for the different bird biodiversity facets are more similar than those of mammals. Our work shows that large gains in biodiversity protection are possible, while also highlighting the need to explicitly link desired conservation objectives and biodiversity metrics.

A ranch formerly dedicated to sheep production was converted into a private wildlife reserve, from which all the sheep were removed in 2005.

Financial incentives are increasingly used with the goal of increasing people's tolerance of predators, but the definition of tolerance has been vague and inconsistent. Empirical correlations between attitudinal and behavioural measures of tolerance imply that attitudes may be a valid proxy for behaviours. However, theoretical differences between the concepts suggest that attitudinal tolerance and behavioural intention to kill cats would have different underlying determinants. We surveyed 112 residents within a forest-farm mosaic in northern Belize inhabited by jaguars Panthera onca and four other species of wild cats. A conservation payment programme pays local landowners when camera traps record cat presence on their land. Results indicated that tolerance was associated with gender and participation in the camera-Trapping programme, whereas intention to kill cats was associated with cultural group (Mennonites vs Mestizos), presence of children in the home and, to a lesser extent, tolerance. Neither dependent variable was significantly related to depredation losses or economic factors. Results suggest that monetary payments alone are unlikely to affect attitudes and behaviours towards carnivores. Payment programmes may be enhanced by accentuating non-monetary incentives, leveraging social norms and targeting specific groups with information about risks and benefits associated with carnivores.

Using a newly assembled and taxonomically expansive database, we analyzed the relationships between extinction risk and body mass (27,647 species) and between extinction risk and range size (21,294 species) for vertebrates across six main classes. We found that the probability of being threatened was positively and significantly related to body mass for birds, cartilaginous fishes, and mammals. Bimodal relationships were evident for amphibians, reptiles, and bony fishes. Most importantly, a bimodal relationship was found across all vertebrates such that extinction risk changes around a body mass breakpoint of 0.035 kg, indicating that the lightest and heaviest vertebrates have elevated extinction risk. We also found range size to be an important predictor of the probability of being threatened, with strong negative relationships across nearly all taxa. A review of the drivers of extinction risk revealed that the heaviest vertebrates are most threatened by direct killing by humans. By contrast, the lightest vertebrates are most threatened by habitat loss and modification stemming especially from pollution, agricultural cropping, and logging. Our results offer insight into halting the ongoing wave of vertebrate extinctions by revealing the vulnerability of large and small taxa, and identifying size-specific threats. Moreover, they indicate that, without intervention, anthropogenic activities will soon precipitate a double truncation of the size distribution of the world’s vertebrates, fundamentally reordering the structure of life on our planet.","Extinction risk is most acute for the world's largest and smallest   vertebrates",0

The Coral Triangle is a hotspot for marine biodiversity held in its coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangrove forests, all of which are in global decline. These coastal ecosystems support valuable fisheries and endangered species, protect shorelines, and are significant carbon stores, functions that have been degraded by coastal development, destructive fishing practices, and climate change. Ecosystem restoration is required to mitigate these damages and losses, but its practice is in its infancy in the region. Here we demonstrate that species diversity can set the trajectory of restoration. In a seagrass restoration experiment in the heart of the Coral Triangle (Sulawesi, Indonesia), plant survival and coverage increased with the number of species transplanted. Our results highlight the positive role biodiversity can play in ecosystem restoration and call for revision of the common restoration practice of establishing a single target species, particularly in regions having high biodiversity. Coastal ecosystems affect human well-being in many important ways, and restoration will become ever more important as conservation efforts cannot keep up with their loss.","Species richness accelerates marine ecosystem restoration in the Coral   Triangle",0

We developed high-resolution habitat fragmentation models and used phylogenetic comparative methods to quantify the effects of habitat fragmentation on the world’s terrestrial mammals, including 4,018 species across 26 taxonomic Orders. Results demonstrate that species with more fragmentation are at greater risk of extinction, even after accounting for the effects of key macroecological predictors, such as body size and geographic range size. Species with higher fragmentation had smaller ranges and a lower proportion of high-suitability habitat within their range, and most high-suitability habitat occurred outside of protected areas, further elevating extinction risk. Our models provide a quantitative evaluation of extinction risk assessments for species, allow for identification of emerging threats in species not classified as threatened, and provide maps of global hotspots of fragmentation for the world’s terrestrial mammals. Quantification of habitat fragmentation will help guide threat assessment and strategic priorities for global mammal conservation.","Quantification of habitat fragmentation reveals extinction risk in   terrestrial mammals",0

To ensure that priorities are biologically comprehensive, multiple dimensions of diversity must be considered. Further, understanding how the different dimensions relate to one another spatially is important for conservation prioritization, but the relationship remains poorly understood. Here, we use spatial conservation planning to (i) identify and compare priority regions for global mammal conservation across three key dimensions of biodiversity - taxonomic, phylogenetic, and traits - and (ii) determine the overlap of these regions with the locations of threatened species and existing protected areas. We show that priority areas for mammal conservation exhibit low overlap across the three dimensions, highlighting the need for an integrative approach for biodiversity conservation. Additionally, currently protected areas poorly represent the three dimensions of mammalian biodiversity. We identify areas of high conservation priority among and across the dimensions that should receive special attention for expanding the global protected area network. These high-priority areas, combined with areas of high priority for other taxonomic groups and with social, economic, and political considerations, provide a biological foundation for future conservation planning efforts.","Global priorities for conservation across multiple dimensions of mammalian diversity",0

We synthesized 176 studies to quantify hunting-induced declines of mammal and bird populations across the tropics. Bird and mammal abundances declined by 58% (25 to 76%) and by 83% (72 to 90%) in hunted compared with unhunted areas. Bird and mammal populations were depleted within 7 and 40 kilometers from hunters' access points (roads and settlements). Additionally, hunting pressure was higher in areas with better accessibility to major towns where wild meat could be traded. Mammal population densities were lower outside protected areas, particularly because of commercial hunting. Strategies to sustainably manage wild meat hunting in both protected and unprotected tropical ecosystems are urgently needed to avoid further defaunation.","The impact of hunting on tropical mammal and bird populations",0
