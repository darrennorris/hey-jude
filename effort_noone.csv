WE STUDIED THE IMPACT OF SHEEP AND GOAT GRAZING ON 50 ASSEMBLAGES OF GROUND SPIDERS (ARANEAE: GNAPHOSIDAE) IN PHRYGANIC, MAQUIS AND FOREST HABITATS FROM ZERO TO 2000 M ELEVATION ON CRETE, GREECE USING PITFALL TRAPS FOR ONE YEAR AT EACH SAMPLING SITE. IN TOTAL, 58 GNAPHOSID SPECIES AND 16,592 INDIVIDUALS WERE COLLECTED. CRETAN ENDEMIC GNAPHOSIDAE WERE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY INTENSIVE GRAZING AND, CONTRARY TO FINDINGS ON OTHER TAXA STUDIED ON THE ISLAND, THEY WERE SPARSE AND RARE THROUGHOUT THE STUDY AREA. THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF GNAPHOSID ASSEMBLAGES WAS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY ELEVATION. TRACHYZELOTES LYONNETI, UROZELOTES RUSTICUS, ZELOTES SCRUTATUS, ANAGRAPHIS PALLENS AND BERINDA AMABILIS PROVED TO BE SIGNIFICANT INDICATORS OF OVERGRAZING. THE VAST MAJORITY OF SPIDERS BELONGING TO SYNANTHROPIC AND NATIONALLY RED-LISTED SPECIES WERE FOUND IN OVERGRAZED SITES. DESPITE THEORETICAL EXPECTATIONS, WHILE THE AVERAGE ACTIVITY DENSITY DECREASED, THE NUMBER OF SPECIES, EVENNESS, RARITY, TAXONOMIC, TEMPORAL AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY (FRIC) INDICES INCREASED WITH INCREASING GRAZING INTENSITY. THIS WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE NATURE OF DISTURBANCE ITSELF, WHICH PROBABLY ALLOWS EQUIBALANCED LOW ABUNDANCES OF INDIGENOUS OR SYNANTHROPIC SPECIES, RATHER THAN OVERDOMINANCE OF FEW, THUS PARTLY REFUTING THE OPPORTUNISTIC SPECIES HYPOTHESIS (OSH). GROUND SPIDER ASSEMBLAGES IN OVERGRAZED SITES COMPRISED SPARSE POPULATIONS OF MOSTLY RARE, OPPORTUNISTIC SPECIES WITH DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS THAT PARTLY REPLACE OTHER SPECIES MORE COMMONLY FOUND IN THE LESS DEGRADED SITES. SPECIES OF THESE ASSEMBLAGES SHORTEN THEIR PHENOLOGIES TO MINIMIZE TEMPORAL CO-OCCURRENCE WITH EACH OTHER DUE TO RESOURCE LIMITATION. THESE DISTINCT COMMUNITY PATTERNS HIGHLIGHT GROUND SPIDERS AS GOOD INDICATORS OF GRAZING PRESSURE ON CRETE, ON SPECIES AND ASSEMBLAGE LEVEL. TO CONSERVE THE INDIGENOUS AND POTENTIALLY ENDANGERED INVERTEBRATE FAUNA, THE SPATIOTEMPORAL DISCONTINUITY OF GRAZING INCLUDING RESTED PATCHES IS IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN SPATIAL VARIABILITY AND POSSIBLY LEAD TO HABITAT RESTORATION."

THEREFORE, WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH INTERACTIONS AND TO TAKE MEASURES TO MITIGATE POSSIBLE NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS. USING THE THREE-RIVERS SOURCE REGION AS A CASE STUDY, WE COMBINED SPECIES HABITAT SUITABILITY, SPECIES FEEDING HABITS, SPECIES CONSERVATION LEVELS AND HUMAN IMPACT INTENSITY TO CONSTRUCT A ``HUMAN-WILDLIFE SPATIAL INTERACTION INDEX'' (HWSII) TO EVALUATE THE INTENSITY OF HUMAN-WILDLIFE SPATIAL INTERACTIONS. THE OVERALL LEVEL OF HWSII WAS RELATIVELY LOW IN THE THREE-RIVER SOURCE REGION. HIGHER POTENTIAL HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS OCCURRED IN AREAS WITH ROADS AND RAILWAYS. AREAS OF RELATIVELY HIGH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CARNIVORES AND LIVESTOCK WERE MAINLY LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STUDY AREA, AND THOSE WITH RELATIVELY HIGH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HERBIVORES AND LIVESTOCK APPEARED IN THE WESTERN AND EASTERN PARTS. MANAGERS IN THESE AREAS SHOULD CONSIDER MITIGATION MEASURES. ALTHOUGH DEVELOPED FOR A SPECIFIC REGION OF CHINA, THE `HUMAN-WILDLIFE SPATIAL INTERACTION INDEX' COULD HAVE APPLICATION IN OTHER AREAS OF THE WORLD FOR SETTING A BASELINE REFERENCE TO IDENTIFY AREAS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGH LEVELS OF HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS AND PINPOINT PLACES WHERE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS CAN BE MITIGATED."

OUR RESULTS SHOW EXTENSIVE CHANGES IN CROP RAIDING PATTERNS. THERE WAS A 49\% INCREASE IN INCIDENTS BETWEEN 1999-2000 AND 2014-2015 BUT AN 83\% DECLINE IN THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE PER FARM. CROP-RAIDING WENT FROM HIGHLY SEASONAL DURING 1999-2000 TO YEARROUND DURING 2014-2015, WITH CROPS BEING DAMAGED AT ALL GROWTH STAGES. ADDITIONALLY, WE IDENTIFIED A NEW ELEPHANT GROUP TYPE INVOLVED IN CROP-RAIDING, COMPRISING OF MIXED GROUPS. SPATIAL PATTERNS OF CROP-RAIDING ALSO CHANGED, WITH MORE INCIDENTS DURING 2014-2015 NEIGHBOURING THE PROTECTED AREA, ESPECIALLY BY BULL GROUPS. CROP-RAIDING INTENSITY DURING 2014-15 INCREASED WITH FARMLAND AREA UNTIL A THRESHOLD OF 0.4 KM(2) WITHIN A 1 KM(2) GRID SQUARE, AND FARMS WITHIN 1 KM FROM THE FOREST BOUNDARY, 5 KM FROM THE PROTECTED AREA BOUNDARY AND 2 KM FROM VILLAGE CENTRES WERE MOST AT RISK OF CROP-RAIDING.

THROUGH THE USE OF PHYLOGENETIC GENERALIZED LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION, THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF HABITAT SPECIALIZATION, LIFE HISTORY, MIGRATION STRATEGY AND CLIMATIC NICHE AS PREDICTORS OF NATIONAL THREAT LEVEL FOR 86 PASSERINE BIRD SPECIES BREEDING IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC. WE FOUND THAT, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR VARIATION IN BREEDING DISTRIBUTION, SLOW LIFE HISTORY INCREASES THE EXTINCTION RISK IN HABITAT SPECIALIST SPECIES, BUT REDUCES SUCH RISK IN HABITAT GENERALISTS. THE HIGHER THREAT OF HABITAT SPECIALISTS IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR HIGHER SENSITIVITY TO HUMAN-INDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL PERTURBATIONS, MOST NOTABLY TO THE HABITAT LOSS. HOWEVER, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF HABITAT SPECIALIZATION APPEAR TO BE SOMEWHAT COMPENSATED FOR BY FAST LIFE HISTORY. FOR EXAMPLE, SPECIES WITH FAST LIFE HISTORIES TYPICALLY DISPLAY HIGHER FECUNDITY THAN SPECIES WITH SLOW LIFE HISTORIES. AT THE SAME TIME, SLOW LIFE HISTORY CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR HABITAT GENERALISTS THAT ARE NOT AS BADLY AFFECTED BY HABITAT DESTRUCTION AS HABITAT SPECIALISTS. SUCH SPECIES ARE ABLE TO ALLOCATE MORE ENERGY TO FUTURE REPRODUCTION AND COULD WAIT FOR OPTIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BEFORE BREEDING, LEADING TO MORE FAVOURABLE POPULATION STATUS IN THE LONG TERM. FINALLY, WE ALSO FOUND THAT SPECIES BREEDING IN WARMER AREAS EXPERIENCE HIGHER EXTINCTION RISK THAN SPECIES BREEDING IN COLDER AREAS. ALTHOUGH THE EFFECT OF CLIMATIC NICHE IS USUALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WE SUGGEST THAT THE HABITAT DESTRUCTION IS MORE LIKELY AN EXPLANATION BECAUSE THE WARMER LOWLAND REGIONS ARE HEAVILY EXPLOITED BY INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIAL AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. BASED UPON THESE RESULTS, WE SUGGEST THAT CURRENT CONSERVATION EFFORT, ESPECIALLY IN WARMER ZONES, MAY NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HABITAT SPECIALISTS WITH SLOW HISTORIES."

THE IMPACT OF THESE SPATIAL CHANGES CAN, HOWEVER, BE INFLUENCED BY THE REGIONAL CONTEXT. TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES, WE ASSESSED THE ABUNDANCE AND IMMATURE-TO-FEMALE RATIO (REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS) OF TWO ENDANGERED HOWLER MONKEYS SPECIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOREST COVER, MATRIX QUALITY AND FOREST FRAGMENTATION (FOREST PATCH DENSITY) IN FOUR MEXICAN REGIONS WITH DIFFERENT DEFORESTATION LEVELS. RESPONSES TO LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE DIFFERED AMONG REGIONS. FOREST LOSS WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO PRIMATE ABUNDANCE IN TWO REGIONS. YET, IN THE MOST DEFORESTED REGION, FOREST LOSS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE IMMATURE-TO-FEMALE RATIO. MATRIX QUALITY WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO MONKEY ABUNDANCE AND POSITIVELY RELATED TO IMMATURE-TO-FEMALE RATIO IN REGIONS DOMINATED BY ARBOREAL MATRICES. FRAGMENTATION WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO ABUNDANCE BUT POSITIVELY TO IMMATURE-TO-FEMALE RATIO IN THE BEST PRESERVED REGION, AND NEGATIVELY RELATED TO IMMATURE-TO-FEMALE RATIO IN A REGION DOMINATED BY TREELESS MATRICES. THUS, GIVEN THAT THE REGIONAL CONTEXT INFLUENCES THE EFFECTS THAT LANDSCAPE ATTRIBUTES HAVE ON PRIMATES, DIFFERENT CONSERVATION STRATEGIES COULD HELP MAINTAIN THE POPULATIONS OF THESE ARBOREAL MAMMALS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS. PREVENTING FOREST LOSS AND RESTORING FOREST COVER ARE PARAMOUNT IN HIGHLY DEFORESTED REGIONS. INCREASING MATRIX QUALITY IS HIGHLY VALUABLE, ESPECIALLY IN REGIONS DOMINATED BY TREELESS MATRICES.

THESE DIFFERENCES CAN BE INTERPRETED AS SIGNALS OF SEPARATE POPULATIONS IN GULFS WHICH MAY ACT AS SOURCES OF VARIABILITY FOR HAKE SPECIES. OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR PHENOMENA IN ATLANTIC WATERS IN BOTH THE NORTHERN AND THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, FOR THESE TWO PELAGIC-DEMERSAL HAKE SPECIES, SUGGESTS THAT GULFS MAY CONSTITUTE A TARGET FOR DESIGNING MARINE PROTECTED AREAS AND CONFIRMS THE ADEQUACY OF GULF-SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT ALREADY EMPLOYED IN ARGENTINA.

OBJECTIVES: EPIGEIC SPIDERS WERE COLLECTED IN EIGHT DIFFERENT HABITATS IN THE AMANZI PRIVATE GAME RESERVE IN THE FREE STATE TO DETERMINE ASSEMBLAGES OF DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES. METHODS: THREE OF THE SAMPLED HABITATS WERE CONTRASTING LOW-LYING SHRUBLANDS; THREE WERE CONTRASTING HILL ASPECTS (NORTHERN SLOPE, SOUTHERN SLOPE AND PLATEAU) IN THE BUDDLEJA SALIGNA-SEARSIA BURCHELLII-OLEA EUROPAEA AFRICANA SUBCOMMUNITY; ONE HABITAT WAS CULTIVATED DIGITARIA ERIANTHA PASTURES, AND THE LAST HABITAT WAS AN AREA IN AND AROUND A FRESHWATER DAM. SPIDERS WERE SAMPLED BY PITFALL TRAPPING IN EARLY SPRING (SEPT. 2012), MID-SUMMER (JAN. 2013), MID-AUTUMN (APR. 2013) AND MID-WINTER (JULY 2013). RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 2982 ADULT SPIDERS WERE COLLECTED, REPRESENTING 129 SPECIES AND 33 FAMILIES. AMMOXENIDAE WAS THE MOST ABUNDANT FAMILY (40.85\%), FOLLOWED BY GNAPHOSIDAE (21.26\%), ZODARIIDAE (10.80\%) AND SALTICIDAE (10.26\%). GNAPHOSIDAE WAS THE MOST SPECIES-RICH FAMILY (24.81\%), FOLLOWED BY SALTICIDAE (13.18\%), LYCOSIDAE (11.63\%) AND ZODARIIDAE (6.20\%). SPIDER ACTIVITY DENSITIES AND SPECIES RICHNESS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN HABITATS, ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS WERE DETECTED. THE THREE HILL ASPECTS AND CULTIVATED D. ERIANTHA PASTURES HAD THE MOST DISTINCT ASSEMBLAGES, WHILE THOSE OF THE THREE LOW-LYING SHRUBLANDS AND FRESHWATER DAM SHOWED CONSIDERABLE OVERLAP. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE ASPECT OF HILLS HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN SHAPING SPIDER ASSEMBLAGES, WHILE THE VEGETATION COMPOSITION OF SHRUBLANDS IS NOT STRONGLY INFLUENTIAL. THE UNIQUE SPIDER ASSEMBLAGES OF CULTIVATED D. ERIANTHA PASTURES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ABSENCE OF WOODY PLANTS. CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS: THIS WAS THE FIRST STUDY TO INVESTIGATE GROUND-DWELLING SPIDER ASSEMBLAGES IN SHRUBLANDS AND CULTIVATED PASTURES IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN GRASSLAND BIOME. OUR STUDY CONFIRMS THAT HILL ASPECTS, SHRUBLANDS AND PASTURES HARBOUR VERY DIFFERENT SPIDER FAUNAS. WHEN IDENTIFYING LAND FOR POTENTIAL EXPANSION OR ESTABLISHMENT OF PROTECTED AREAS, CONSERVATION PLANNERS SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE GREATEST DIVERSITY OF VEGETATION UNITS ARE INCLUDED TO OPTIMISE THE CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY."

ABSTRACT UNDERSTANDING RAPID ADAPTATION TO NOVEL ENVIRONMENTS IS ESSENTIAL AS WE FACE INCREASING CLIMATIC CHANGE. INVASIVE SPECIES ARE AN IDEAL SYSTEM FOR STUDYING ADAPTATION AS THEY ARE TYPICALLY INTRODUCED TO NOVEL ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THEY MUST ADAPT IF THEY ARE TO PERSIST. WE USED THE INVASIVE CANE TOAD, RHINELLA MARINA, TO INVESTIGATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF PLASTICITY AND EVOLUTION TO RAPID ADAPTATION IN A NOVEL ENVIRONMENT. RHINELLA MARINA IS A NEOTROPICAL TOAD THAT HAS INVADED AREAS WITH CLIMATES OUTSIDE OF ITS NATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NICHE. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO UNDERSTAND HOW CANE TOADS PERSIST IN NORTHERN FLORIDA, THE COLDEST REGION OF THEIR COMBINED NATURAL AND INVASIVE RANGE, AND ORIGINALLY THOUGHT TO BE BEYOND THEIR THERMAL BREADTH. WE MEASURED CRITICAL THERMAL MINIMA IN CANE TOADS FROM THE ORIGINAL, WARM INTRODUCTION LOCATION (MIAMI), AND THEIR NORTHERN RANGE EDGE (TAMPA) TO DETERMINE WHETHER NORTHERN TOADS WERE MORE COLD-TOLERANT, AND TO EXAMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF ADAPTIVE PLASTICITY AND EVOLUTION TO ANY CHANGES IN TOLERANCE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT FOLLOWING ACCLIMATION TO COLD TEMPERATURES, SOUTHERN TOADS ARE LESS TOLERANT OF COLD THAN NORTHERN TOADS. THIS PERSISTENT POPULATION DIFFERENCE IMPLIES SELECTION FOR COLD-TOLERANCE IN NORTHERN POPULATIONS. DIFFERENCES IN INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES INDICATE THAT PLASTICITY IS ALSO INVOLVED IN THIS RESPONSE. OUR FINDINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION BECAUSE PREDATORY CANE TOAD INVASIONS THREATEN LOCAL FAUNAS, ESPECIALLY NATIVE AMPHIBIANS. CHARACTERIZING SPECIFIC ADAPTIVE MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW R.

TO EVALUATE THE CROSS-SCALE FUNCTIONING OF NATURA 2000 IMPLEMENTATION, WE ANALYZED 242 QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED BY CONSERVATION SCIENTISTS INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NATURA 2000 IN 24 EU MEMBER STATES. RESPONDENTS IDENTIFIED 7 KEY DRIVERS OF THE QUALITY OF NATURA 2000 IMPLEMENTATION. ORDERED IN DECREASING EVALUATION SCORE, THESE DRIVERS INCLUDED: NETWORK DESIGN, USE OF EXTERNAL RESOURCES, LEGAL FRAME, SCIENTIFIC INPUT, PROCEDURAL FRAME, SOCIAL INPUT, AND NATIONAL OR LOCAL POLICY. OVERALL, CONSERVATION SCIENTISTS WERE MODERATELY SATISFIED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NATURA 2000. TREE MODELING REVEALED THAT POOR APPLICATION OF RESULTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS (EIA) WAS CONSIDERED A MAJOR CONSTRAINT. THE MAIN STRENGTHS OF THE NETWORK INCLUDED THE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITES, THE CONTRIBUTION OF NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, THE ADEQUATE NETWORK DESIGN IN TERMS OF AREA AND REPRESENTATIVENESS, AND THE ADEQUACY OF THE EU LEGAL FRAME. THE MAIN WEAKNESSES OF NATURA 2000 WERE THE LACK OF POLITICAL WILL FROM LOCAL AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS TOWARD EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION; THE NEGATIVE ATTITUDE OF LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS; THE LACK OF BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE OF LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, WHICH PREVENTED WELL-INFORMED POLICY DECISIONS; AND THE UNDERSTAFFING OF NATURA 2000 MANAGEMENT AUTHORITIES. TOP SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE NATURA 2000 IMPLEMENTATION WERE INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS, PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES, INVOLVE HIGH-QUALITY CONSERVATION EXPERTS, STRENGTHEN QUALITY CONTROL OF EIA STUDIES, AND ESTABLISH A SPECIFIC NATURA 2000 FUND.

USING SKELETOCHRONOLOGY WE FOUND THAT THE ADULT MALE POPULATION IN BOTH 2011 AND 2012 WAS DOMINATED BY A TWO YEAR OLD AGE COHORT. THE LACK OF RECRUITMENT INTO THE THREE YEAR OLD COHORT IN 2012 INDICATES THAT ANNUAL ADULT SURVIVAL IS VERY LOW. COMBINED WITH HIGH BD PREVALENCE AND HEAVY INFECTION BURDENS, THE PATHOGEN APPEARS TO DRIVE ALMOST COMPLETE MORTALITY OF BREEDING ADULTS OVER THEIR FIRST BREEDING SEASON. HOWEVER, ADULTS SUCCESSFULLY MATE PRIOR TO LARGE INCREASES IN DISEASE PREVALENCE THAT OCCURS DURING THE BREEDING SEASON. INFECTION PREVALENCE AMONG TADPOLES AND JUVENILES IS LOW. EXPOSURE TO WARM WATER COULD PROVIDE A MECHANISM FOR AVOIDING OR CLEARING BD INFECTION. RELATIVELY LOW BD PREVALENCE IN JUVENILES PRIOR TO DISPERSAL INTO TERRESTRIAL HABITAT INDICATES THAT BD HAS MINIMAL IMPACT ON EARLY LIFE HISTORY STAGES. AS SUCH, RECRUITMENT IS PROBABLY HIGH, ALLOWING POPULATIONS TO PERSIST DESPITE LOW ADULT SURVIVAL. THIS DEPENDENCE ON RELIABLE ANNUAL RECRUITMENT MAY EXPLAIN WHY REMNANT POPULATIONS PERSIST IN PERMANENT PONDS RATHER THAN EPHEMERAL PONDS THAT WERE HISTORICALLY OCCUPIED.

HOWEVER, IT IS STILL DEBATED WHETHER LEGALIZATION AND WILDLIFE FARMING CAN SATURATE DEMAND AND THUS REDUCE POACHING, OR IF THESE POLICIES INCREASE DEMAND, AND SUBSEQUENTLY POACHING OF VULNERABLE WILDLIFE. THIS PAPER USED AN EXPERIMENTAL VIGNETTE SURVEY IN MAINLAND CHINA (N = 1002) TO EXPLORE EMPIRICALLY HOW LEGALIZATION, WILDLIFE FARMING, AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN CONSUMPTIVE ACCEPTABILITY AFFECT DEMAND FOR WILDLIFE PRODUCTS. EACH RESPONDENT READ A VIGNETTE ABOUT THE CONSUMPTION OF A WILDLIFE PRODUCT FROM ONE OF FOUR SPECIES (BEARS, TIGERS, SNAKES, OR TURTLES), FOR ONE OF TWO USES (MEDICINAL OR NON-MEDICINAL), IN ONE OF THREE LEGAL SITUATIONS (PRODUCT IS ILLEGAL, PRODUCT IS LEGAL AND FROM FARMED ANIMAL, OR PRODUCT IS LEGAL AND FROM WILD ANIMAL). ALL RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED ABOUT THE ACCEPTABILITY OF WILDLIFE CONSUMPTION, THE SOCIAL STIGMA AROUND CONSUMPTION, AND THE PERCEIVED LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF CONSUMPTION FOR EIGHT PRODUCTS: BEAR BILE, BEAR PAWS, TIGER BONE, TIGER SKIN, SNAKE BILE, SNAKE LEATHER, TURTLE SHELLS, AND TURTLE MEAT. DATA WAS ANALYZED USING LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS THAT INCLUDED INTERACTION EFFECTS AND CONTROLLED FOR AGE, GENDER, EDUCATION, INCOME, AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS SPECIFIC SPECIES, TOWARDS WILDLIFE CONSUMPTION, AND TOWARDS TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE. WILDLIFE PRODUCT BANS DECREASED THE ACCEPTABILITY AND SOCIAL APPROVAL OF WILDLIFE CONSUMPTION AND INCREASED ESTIMATIONS OF LEGAL PUNISHMENTS. THE TYPE OF BAN THAT PRODUCED THESE EFFECTS DEPENDED UPON THE WILDLIFE PRODUCT AND THE MEASUREMENT OF WILDLIFE CONSUMPTION. THE EFFECTS OF WILDLIFE FARMING ON DEMAND FOR WILDLIFE PRODUCTS WERE PARTICULARLY PROMINENT FOR MAMMALS. BEAR FARMING INCREASED THE ACCEPTABILITY AND PERCEIVED SOCIAL APPROVAL OF BEAR BILE; IT ALSO DECREASED PERCEIVED LEGAL SANCTIONS FOR BEAR CONSUMPTION. TIGER FARMING DIMINISHED PERCEIVED LEGAL SANCTIONS FOR TIGER CONSUMPTION AND FARMING TIGERS FOR MEDICINAL USE INCREASED THE ACCEPTABILITY OF TIGER CONSUMPTION. OVERALL, THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT BANS ON WILDLIFE CONSUMPTION AND DECREASED WILDLIFE FARMING OF MAMMALS CAN HAVE CONSERVATION BENEFITS. (C) 2020 THE AUTHOR(S). PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER B.V.

IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE RESEARCHED FISHING ACTIVITIES IN TWO VILLAGES OF THE TRUKA ETHNIC GROUP, BOTH LOCATED IN THE STATE OF PERNAMBUCO ALONG THE SUB-MIDDLE SECTION OF THE SAO FRANCISCO RIVER, NORTHEAST BRAZIL. WE RECORDED THE RICHNESS AND USES OF THE FISHED SPECIES AND THE ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE ON THESE SPECIES, THE FISHING TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED AND THE PERCEPTION OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE REGARDING CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ON THE SAO FRANCISCO RIVER THAT INFLUENCE LOCAL FISHING. METHOD: THE INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED THROUGH INTERVIEWS WITH 33 TRUKA FISHERS (27 MEN AND SIX WOMEN), INCLUDING 17 INTERVIEWEES FROM CENTRAL VILLAGE (CABROBO) AND 16 FROM TAPERA VILLAGE (OROCO). RESULTS: USING FIVE FISHING TECHNIQUES, THE INTERVIEWEES CAUGHT 25 FISH SPECIES, INCLUDING 21 NATIVE AND FOUR EXOTIC SPECIES. ALL SPECIES ARE USED AS FOOD, AND TWO SPECIES ARE USED IN TRADITIONAL TRUKA MEDICINE. THE INTERVIEWEES REVEALED THAT FISHING CURRENTLY HAS LESS IMPORTANCE IN THEIR SUBSISTENCE. THEY INDICATED THAT THIS SITUATION IS OCCURRING BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS, SUCH AS THE INTRODUCTION OF EXOTIC SPECIES, POLLUTION AND URBANIZATION, THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE SAO FRANCISCO RIVER, RESULTING IN A DECLINE OF FISHING RESOURCES. NEVERTHELESS, WE FOUND THAT THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL FISHING HAVE A BROAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE HABITAT AND ECOLOGY OF THE TARGET FISHING. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH FISHING IS DECLINING IN IMPORTANCE AMONG THE TRUKA, WE FOUND THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE STILL PRACTICING THIS ACTIVITY HAVE A BROAD KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE HABITAT AND ECOLOGY OF THE TARGET SPECIES AND APPLY THAT KNOWLEDGE TO FISHING METHODS. KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ECOLOGY OF THE SPECIES AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THEM CAN SUPPORT BASIC RESEARCH ON LOCAL FISH POPULATIONS AND RESEARCH INVESTIGATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE EXPLOITATION OF FISHERIES RESOURCES."

WE INSPECTED VARIOGRAMS TO DISTINGUISH DISPERSERS FROM RESIDENTS THEN WE ESTIMATED MOVEMENT METRICS AND HOME RANGES USING CONTINUOUS-TIME MOVEMENT MODELS AND AUTOCORRELATED KERNEL DENSITY ESTIMATION. USING GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS, WE TESTED FOR SEASONAL DIFFERENCES IN ALL MOVEMENT AND HOME RANGE METRICS. OF THREE SUBADULTS THAT DISPERSED, ONE HAD DATA APPROPRIATE FOR SPEED ESTIMATION; SHE EXHIBITED FASTER SPEEDS WHILE DISPERSING THAN WHILE EXHIBITING PHILOPATRIC MOVEMENTS. COMPARED TO ADULT RESIDENT MALES, ADULT RESIDENT FEMALES MOVED WITH SLOWER AVERAGE SPEEDS (FEMALES: 11.82 +/- 0.43 KM/DAY; MALES: 20.36 +/- 2.86 KM/DAY), EXHIBITED SIMILAR DIRECTIONAL PERSISTENCE IN MOVEMENT (FEMALES: 0.95 +/- 0.14 H; MALES: 1.12 +/- 0.21 H), CROSSED THEIR HOME RANGES IN SIMILAR TIMES (FEMALES: 5.76 +/- 0.98 DAYS; MALES: 7.07 +/- 1.34 DAYS), AND USED SMALLER HOME RANGES THAN MALES (FEMALES: 283.83 +/- 37.50 KM2: MALES: 1077.95 +/ - 219.30 KM2). ADULTS MOVED WITH SLOWEST SPEEDS IN THE COLD-DRY SEASON; THERE WERE NO SEASONAL EFFECTS ON OTHER ESTIMATES. EACH INDIVIDUAL'S SUCCESSIVE SEASONAL HOME RANGES WERE HIGHLY OVERLAPPED (0.95 +/- 0.01). THE MOUNTAIN LIONS DID NOT EXPAND, CONTRACT, OR SHIFT THEIR HOME RANGES SEASONALLY, WHICH MAY BE DUE TO AMPLE PREY-AVAILABILITY AND LIMITED SEASONAL-SHIFTS IN PREY DISTRIBUTION. MOUNTAIN LIONS USED AREAS LARGER THAN MOST LOCAL RANCHES AND TENDED TO MOVE ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE QUICKLY. TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT MOUNTAIN LIONS DO NOT TYPICALLY STAY ON ONE PROPERTY FOR LONG WHICH MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION PLANNING AND SPECIES MANAGEMENT."

WE ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF URBANIZATION ON THE TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL ALPHA AND BETA DIVERSITY OF FISH ASSEMBLAGES IN THE HEADWATER STREAMS OF THE XIN'AN RIVER IN CHINA. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT COMPARED WITH NATURAL SEGMENTS, URBAN SEGMENTS HAD HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS AND LOWER FUNCTIONAL RICHNESS, WHICH RESULTED FROM THE GAIN OF NATIVE INVASIVE SPECIES AND THE LOSS OF ENDEMIC SPECIES; FISH ASSEMBLAGES ALSO BECAME TAXONOMICALLY DIFFERENTIATED BUT FUNCTIONALLY HOMOGENIZED. IN ADDITION, DELTA FD (DIFFERENCE VALUE IN FUNCTIONAL BETA DIVERSITY BETWEEN URBAN AND NATURAL SEGMENTS) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH DELTA TD (DIFFERENCE VALUE IN TAXONOMIC BETA DIVERSITY BETWEEN URBAN AND NATURAL SEGMENTS), WHEREAS ONLY DELTA FD WAS SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE URBANIZATION INDICATORS (E.G. URBAN LAND USE AND AMMONIA NITROGEN CONCENTRATION). THUS, A COMBINATION OF TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY INDICES BETTER REVEALS HOW FISH BIODIVERSITY RESPONDS TO URBANIZATION. OUR STUDY PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF URBANIZATION-INDUCED CHANGES IN FISH ASSEMBLAGES AS WELL AS EARLY WARNING SIGNS FOR URBAN-DISTURBED ECOSYSTEMS, BOTH OF WHICH WILL BENEFIT FISH CONSERVATION IN HEADWATER STREAMS."

LOCATION: A 2600-M ELEVATIONAL GRADIENT ALONG MOUNT EMEI IN SOUTHWESTERN CHINA. METHODS: WE INVESTIGATED ELEVATIONAL PATTERNS AND ASSEMBLY PROCESSES OF PAIRWISE BETA-DIVERSITY ACROSS THREE DIMENSIONS (TAXONOMIC, PHYLOGENETIC, AND FUNCTIONAL) IN TURNOVER (I.E., SPECIES REPLACEMENT) AND NESTEDNESS-RESULTANT (I.E., SPECIES LOSE/GAIN) FOR AMPHIBIANS.
