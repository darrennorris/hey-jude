THEREFORE, WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH INTERACTIONS AND TO TAKE MEASURES TO MITIGATE POSSIBLE NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS. USING THE THREE-RIVERS SOURCE REGION AS A CASE STUDY, WE COMBINED SPECIES HABITAT SUITABILITY, SPECIES FEEDING HABITS, SPECIES CONSERVATION LEVELS AND HUMAN IMPACT INTENSITY TO CONSTRUCT A ``HUMAN-WILDLIFE SPATIAL INTERACTION INDEX'' (HWSII) TO EVALUATE THE INTENSITY OF HUMAN-WILDLIFE SPATIAL INTERACTIONS. THE OVERALL LEVEL OF HWSII WAS RELATIVELY LOW IN THE THREE-RIVER SOURCE REGION. HIGHER POTENTIAL HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS OCCURRED IN AREAS WITH ROADS AND RAILWAYS. AREAS OF RELATIVELY HIGH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CARNIVORES AND LIVESTOCK WERE MAINLY LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STUDY AREA, AND THOSE WITH RELATIVELY HIGH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HERBIVORES AND LIVESTOCK APPEARED IN THE WESTERN AND EASTERN PARTS. MANAGERS IN THESE AREAS SHOULD CONSIDER MITIGATION MEASURES. ALTHOUGH DEVELOPED FOR A SPECIFIC REGION OF CHINA, THE `HUMAN-WILDLIFE SPATIAL INTERACTION INDEX' COULD HAVE APPLICATION IN OTHER AREAS OF THE WORLD FOR SETTING A BASELINE REFERENCE TO IDENTIFY AREAS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGH LEVELS OF HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS AND PINPOINT PLACES WHERE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS CAN BE MITIGATED."

WE INVESTIGATED SEASONAL, TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL TRENDS OF ELEPHANT CROP-RAIDING IN THE TRANS MARA, KENYA DURING 2014-2015 AND COMPARED OUR RESULTS WITH A PREVIOUS STUDY FROM 1999 TO 2000. OUR RESULTS SHOW EXTENSIVE CHANGES IN CROP RAIDING PATTERNS. THERE WAS A 49\% INCREASE IN INCIDENTS BETWEEN 1999-2000 AND 2014-2015 BUT AN 83\% DECLINE IN THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE PER FARM. CROP-RAIDING WENT FROM HIGHLY SEASONAL DURING 1999-2000 TO YEARROUND DURING 2014-2015, WITH CROPS BEING DAMAGED AT ALL GROWTH STAGES. ADDITIONALLY, WE IDENTIFIED A NEW ELEPHANT GROUP TYPE INVOLVED IN CROP-RAIDING, COMPRISING OF MIXED GROUPS. SPATIAL PATTERNS OF CROP-RAIDING ALSO CHANGED, WITH MORE INCIDENTS DURING 2014-2015 NEIGHBOURING THE PROTECTED AREA, ESPECIALLY BY BULL GROUPS. CROP-RAIDING INTENSITY DURING 2014-15 INCREASED WITH FARMLAND AREA UNTIL A THRESHOLD OF 0.4 KM(2) WITHIN A 1 KM(2) GRID SQUARE, AND FARMS WITHIN 1 KM FROM THE FOREST BOUNDARY, 5 KM FROM THE PROTECTED AREA BOUNDARY AND 2 KM FROM VILLAGE CENTRES WERE MOST AT RISK OF CROP-RAIDING. IN THE LAST 20 YEARS THE MARA ECOSYSTEM HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE, AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION AND INCREASED CATTLE GRAZING WITHIN PROTECTED AREAS. ELEPHANTS SEEM TO HAVE RESPONDED BY CROP-RAIDING CLOSER TO REFUGES, MORE FREQUENTLY AND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BUT CAUSE LESS DAMAGE OVERALL. WHILE THIS MEANS THE DIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT HAS DROPPED, MORE FARMERS MUST SPEND MORE TIME PROTECTING THEIR FIELDS, FURTHER REDUCING SUPPORT FOR CONSERVATION IN COMMUNITIES WHO CURRENTLY RECEIVE FEW BENEFITS FROM LIVING WITH WILDLIFE."

IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND THE DEMOGRAPHIC MECHANISMS OF POPULATION PERSISTENCE OR EXTIRPATION IN FRAGMENTED PATCHES. WE STUDIED DYNAMICS OF SPATIALLY STRUCTURED POPULATIONS OF TWO JAPANESE LANDLOCKED SALMONIDS PERSISTING FOR >30 YEARS IN A HEADWATER STREAM NETWORK THAT IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED DUE TO LOW-HEAD DAMS IN THE MAINSTEM. WE PARAMETERISED AND ANALYSED SPATIAL MATRIX POPULATION MODELS USING 9-YEAR MARK-RECAPTURE DATA. TRIBUTARIES SUPPORTED HIGHER SURVIVAL RATES IN SOME LIFE STAGES, AND MOVEMENT WAS ASYMMETRICAL FROM THE TRIBUTARIES TO THE MAINSTEM. ACCORDINGLY, POPULATION GROWTH RATES WERE HIGHER IN THE TRIBUTARY PATCHES THAN THE MAINSTEM IN BOTH SPECIES DESPITE THE TRIBUTARIES OCCUPYING ONLY 12\% OR 18\% OF THE STUDY STREAM NETWORK BY SURFACE AREA. THE TRIBUTARIES HARBOURED MORE PHYSICALLY AND HYDRAULICALLY COMPLEX INSTREAM HABITATS (I.E.

OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT STREAM MANAGEMENT PLANS UNDERESTIMATING THE DEMOGRAPHIC VALUE OF SMALL TRIBUTARIES WILL LIKELY FAIL TO CONSERVE POPULATIONS OF HEADWATER INHABITANTS AND THEREFORE ENDANGER AQUATIC BIODIVERSITY.

BIRD DISTRIBUTION WAS SURVEYED USING CAR AND FOOT SURVEYS. DATA ON GRAZING WAS SUPPLIED BY LAND MANAGERS EVERY 10 DAYS FROM FEBRUARY TO JUNE THROUGH FIELD INTERVIEWS. GENERALISED ADDITIVE MODELS AND MODEL AVERAGING WERE USED TO COMPUTE PREDICTIVE MODELS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT HIGHER PROBABILITIES OF OCCURRENCE WERE FOUND IN LONG-TERM PASTURES AND UNDER LIGHT-MODERATE GRAZING CONDITIONS (STOCKING RATES AROUND 0.4 LU/HA).

OBJECTIVES: EPIGEIC SPIDERS WERE COLLECTED IN EIGHT DIFFERENT HABITATS IN THE AMANZI PRIVATE GAME RESERVE IN THE FREE STATE TO DETERMINE ASSEMBLAGES OF DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES. METHODS: THREE OF THE SAMPLED HABITATS WERE CONTRASTING LOW-LYING SHRUBLANDS; THREE WERE CONTRASTING HILL ASPECTS (NORTHERN SLOPE, SOUTHERN SLOPE AND PLATEAU) IN THE BUDDLEJA SALIGNA-SEARSIA BURCHELLII-OLEA EUROPAEA AFRICANA SUBCOMMUNITY; ONE HABITAT WAS CULTIVATED DIGITARIA ERIANTHA PASTURES, AND THE LAST HABITAT WAS AN AREA IN AND AROUND A FRESHWATER DAM. SPIDERS WERE SAMPLED BY PITFALL TRAPPING IN EARLY SPRING (SEPT. 2012), MID-SUMMER (JAN. 2013), MID-AUTUMN (APR. 2013) AND MID-WINTER (JULY 2013). RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 2982 ADULT SPIDERS WERE COLLECTED, REPRESENTING 129 SPECIES AND 33 FAMILIES. AMMOXENIDAE WAS THE MOST ABUNDANT FAMILY (40.85\%), FOLLOWED BY GNAPHOSIDAE (21.26\%), ZODARIIDAE (10.80\%) AND SALTICIDAE (10.26\%). GNAPHOSIDAE WAS THE MOST SPECIES-RICH FAMILY (24.81\%), FOLLOWED BY SALTICIDAE (13.18\%), LYCOSIDAE (11.63\%) AND ZODARIIDAE (6.20\%). SPIDER ACTIVITY DENSITIES AND SPECIES RICHNESS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN HABITATS, ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS WERE DETECTED. THE THREE HILL ASPECTS AND CULTIVATED D. ERIANTHA PASTURES HAD THE MOST DISTINCT ASSEMBLAGES, WHILE THOSE OF THE THREE LOW-LYING SHRUBLANDS AND FRESHWATER DAM SHOWED CONSIDERABLE OVERLAP. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE ASPECT OF HILLS HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN SHAPING SPIDER ASSEMBLAGES, WHILE THE VEGETATION COMPOSITION OF SHRUBLANDS IS NOT STRONGLY INFLUENTIAL. THE UNIQUE SPIDER ASSEMBLAGES OF CULTIVATED D. ERIANTHA PASTURES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ABSENCE OF WOODY PLANTS. CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS: THIS WAS THE FIRST STUDY TO INVESTIGATE GROUND-DWELLING SPIDER ASSEMBLAGES IN SHRUBLANDS AND CULTIVATED PASTURES IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN GRASSLAND BIOME. OUR STUDY CONFIRMS THAT HILL ASPECTS, SHRUBLANDS AND PASTURES HARBOUR VERY DIFFERENT SPIDER FAUNAS.

ABSTRACT UNDERSTANDING RAPID ADAPTATION TO NOVEL ENVIRONMENTS IS ESSENTIAL AS WE FACE INCREASING CLIMATIC CHANGE. INVASIVE SPECIES ARE AN IDEAL SYSTEM FOR STUDYING ADAPTATION AS THEY ARE TYPICALLY INTRODUCED TO NOVEL ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THEY MUST ADAPT IF THEY ARE TO PERSIST. WE USED THE INVASIVE CANE TOAD, RHINELLA MARINA, TO INVESTIGATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF PLASTICITY AND EVOLUTION TO RAPID ADAPTATION IN A NOVEL ENVIRONMENT. RHINELLA MARINA IS A NEOTROPICAL TOAD THAT HAS INVADED AREAS WITH CLIMATES OUTSIDE OF ITS NATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NICHE. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO UNDERSTAND HOW CANE TOADS PERSIST IN NORTHERN FLORIDA, THE COLDEST REGION OF THEIR COMBINED NATURAL AND INVASIVE RANGE, AND ORIGINALLY THOUGHT TO BE BEYOND THEIR THERMAL BREADTH. WE MEASURED CRITICAL THERMAL MINIMA IN CANE TOADS FROM THE ORIGINAL, WARM INTRODUCTION LOCATION (MIAMI), AND THEIR NORTHERN RANGE EDGE (TAMPA) TO DETERMINE WHETHER NORTHERN TOADS WERE MORE COLD-TOLERANT, AND TO EXAMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF ADAPTIVE PLASTICITY AND EVOLUTION TO ANY CHANGES IN TOLERANCE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT FOLLOWING ACCLIMATION TO COLD TEMPERATURES, SOUTHERN TOADS ARE LESS TOLERANT OF COLD THAN NORTHERN TOADS. THIS PERSISTENT POPULATION DIFFERENCE IMPLIES SELECTION FOR COLD-TOLERANCE IN NORTHERN POPULATIONS. DIFFERENCES IN INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES INDICATE THAT PLASTICITY IS ALSO INVOLVED IN THIS RESPONSE. OUR FINDINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION BECAUSE PREDATORY CANE TOAD INVASIONS THREATEN LOCAL FAUNAS, ESPECIALLY NATIVE AMPHIBIANS. CHARACTERIZING SPECIFIC ADAPTIVE MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW R.

MORPHOLOGICALLY IDENTIFIED SPECIES WERE ASSIGNED FUNCTIONAL TRAITS INCLUDING BODY LENGTH, FEEDING STRATEGY, TROPHIC GROUP, REPRODUCTION MODE AND HABITAT TYPE, AND CLUSTERED INTO FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY INDICES WERE CALCULATED. THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES IN EXPLAINING THE SEASONALITY OF FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURES WAS ASSESSED. RESULTS: TEN FUNCTIONAL GROUPS WERE IDENTIFIED, AND FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE SHOWED STRONG SEASONAL DYNAMICS. CURRENT- AND MIXED-FEEDING OMNIVORE-HERBIVORES WERE THE PREDOMINANT GROUP OVER SEASONS. THE CONTRIBUTION OF CARNIVOROUS, DETRITIVOROUS AND OMNIVOROUS GROUPS INCREASED FROM WINTER-SPRING TO AUTUMN. THE SEASONALITY OF ZOOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE WAS MAINLY EXPLAINED BY THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE, FLUVIAL DISCHARGE AND WARM CURRENT. LOW TEMPERATURE AND RIVERINE INPUT OF NUTRIENT IN WINTER-SPRING FAVOURED THE SMALL-SIZED HERBIVORES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE RISING TEMPERATURE AND RUN-OFF IN SUMMER SHIFTED THE ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY TO LARGER HERBIVORES AND CARNIVORES. MODERATE TEMPERATURE AND RELATIVELY ENHANCED EFFECT OF WARM CURRENT PROMOTED THE PROLIFERATION OF CARNIVORES AND DETRITIVORES IN AUTUMN. FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY ALSO VARIED OVER SEASONS.

THE UBIQUITOUS USE OF CONCRETE IN TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO ALTERATIONS IN FRESHWATER AND COASTAL MARINE SYSTEMS. YET, IN SOME CASES, THERE ARE NO APPROPRIATE ALTERNATIVE BUILDING MATERIALS SUCH THAT CONCRETE ITSELF IS CONFOUNDED BY ITS APPLICATION. FOR EXAMPLE, AS THE FOUNDATION FOR MOST DAMS, CONCRETE FRAGMENTS RIVERS AND CHANNELIZES STREAMS, OFTEN CREATING UNNATURAL SYSTEMS, YET DAMS ARE NECESSARY FOR HYDROPOWER GENERATION AND FLOOD CONTROL WITH FEW ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS FOR CONSTRUCTION. IN RIPARIAN AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS, CONCRETE HARBOURS AND INLAND CANAL SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN USED TO ADDRESS EROSION OR RECLAIM AREAS FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. EVEN WHEN REMOVED (E.G., DAM REMOVAL, NATURALIZATION OF SHORELINES), CONCRETE DUST IS A MAJOR AQUATIC POLLUTANT. INSTANCES DO EXIST, HOWEVER, WHERE CONCRETE HAS BEEN USED TO BENEFIT AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS - SUCH AS THE INSTALLATION OF FISH PASSAGE FACILITIES AT BARRIERS OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FISH-FRIENDLY CULVERTS - THOUGH EVEN THEN, THERE IS A MOVEMENT TOWARDS NATURE-LIKE FISHWAYS THAT AVOID THE USE OF HARMFUL MATERIALS LIKE CONCRETE. THERE ARE ALSO OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE CONSERVATION GAINS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEAWALLS THAT INCLUDE MORE NATURAL AND COMPLEX FEATURES TO BENEFIT BIOTA AND ALLOW FOR ESSENTIAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES TO OCCUR IN AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL INNOVATIONS IN RECENT YEARS THAT INCREASE THE PERMEABILITY OF CONCRETE, HOWEVER THESE HAVE LIMITED APPLICATION IN AN AQUATIC CONTEXT (E.G., NOT RELEVANT TO DAM CONSTRUCTION OR EROSION CONTROL BUT MAY BE RELEVANT IN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS). WE PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORY OF CONCRETE, DISCUSS SOME OF THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF CONCRETE ON AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS, AND ENCOURAGE PLANNERS, ENGINEERS, DEVELOPERS, AND REGULATORS TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES TO CONCRETE WHICH BENEFIT AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS AND THE SERVICES THEY OFFER.

IT HAS ALSO BECOME OBVIOUS THAT THERE IS A NEED TO PUBLISH A LIST OF ROMANIAN CAVE SPECIES THAT ARE UNDER THREAT. CAVE SPECIES IN ROMANIA (AND ELSEWHERE) ARE ENDEMIC ON SMALL RANGES, ARE UNIQUE AND MUST BE CONSIDERED AS IMPORTANT UNITS FOR CONSERVATION. A CAVE MUST BE EQUALLY PROTECTED IF IT HAS ONE OR MORE RARE AND STRICTLY ENDEMIC CAVE SPECIES.

THE GIS APPLICATION WAS USED TO COMPLEMENT THE CHECKLIST OF CAVE SPECIES WITH DATA ON CAVES AND SURFACE ENVIRONMENTS ABOVE THE CAVES. UNTIL COMPLETE DATA ON SPECIES DIVERSITY AND POPULATION SIZES ARE MADE AVAILABLE FOR EACH CAVE, MEASURES OF CONSERVATION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED, BASED ON THE PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF CAVE SPECIES, WHILE CLASSIFICATIONS OF CAVES FOR PROTECTION, BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SPECIES, MUST BE AVOIDED.

FURTHERMORE, WE FOUND THAT OCCUPANCY OF EIGHT BIRD SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN WAS RELATED TO SPECIFIC THRESHOLDS OF FOREST INTEGRITY CHARACTERISTICS. FOR EXAMPLE, PREDICTED OCCUPANCY OF THREE OF EIGHT SPECIES WAS HIGH IN FORESTED HABITATS WITH >15 \% BAMBOO COVER AND WAS GREATLY REDUCED WHEN BARE GROUND COVER EXCEEDED 5 \%. WE FOUND THAT BIRD SPECIES FORAGED ON PINE (PINUS DENSATA, 58 \% MORE THAN IT WAS AVAILABLE) AND POPLAR (POPULUS DAVIDIANA, 41 \%) IN HIGHER PROPORTION TO THEIR AVAILABILITY, BUT THAT FORAGING SUCCESS WAS HIGHEST ON FIR (ABIES SPP.), OAK (QUERCUS SPP.), WILLOW (SALIX SPP.) AND CHINESE LARCH (LARIX POTANINII). OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, ALTHOUGH CONSERVATION IS NOT A PRIMARY MANAGEMENT GOAL OF TIBETAN SACRED FORESTS, THESE LANDS HARBOR CRITICAL HABITAT FEATURES FOR FOREST BREEDING BIRDS OF THE CHINESE HIMALAYA."

THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO DOCUMENT ANIMAL-BASED TRADITIONAL THERAPIES USED BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF JHELUM AND LAHORE DISTRICTS OF THE PUNJAB PROVINCE, PAKISTAN. METHODS: FIELD SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED IN 2015-2016 IN SIX DIFFERENT SITES OF THE STUDY AREAS. DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND FACE TO FACE CONVERSATION WITH LOCAL INFORMANTS. RESULTS: THE ETHNOMEDICINAL USES OF 57 SPECIES OF ANIMALS INCLUDING MAMMALS, BIRDS, FISH, REPTILES, AMPHIBIAN, AND INVERTEBRATES (30, 25, 25, 7, 3.5, AND 3.5\%, RESPECTIVELY) WERE DOCUMENTED.

TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF DEVELOPMENT ON HABITAT QUALITY FOR GRASSLAND BIRDS, WE STUDIED GRASSLAND BIRD NEST PREDATION AND BROOD PARASITISM IN PATCHES OF VARYING SIZE ALONG AN URBANIZATION GRADIENT IN NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS.

SUCH IS THE CASE FOR MOUNTAIN LIONS (PUMA CONCOLOR) IN WEST TEXAS, WHERE MOST OF THE LAND IS PRIVATELY OWNED. THEREFORE, WE SOUGHT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND MOVEMENTS AND HOME RANGES OF MOUNTAIN LIONS IN THE TRANS-PECOS REGION OF TEXAS. WE GPS COLLARED 24 MOUNTAIN LIONS (15 FEMALES, 9 MALES) BETWEEN 2011 AND 2017.

ADULTS MOVED WITH SLOWEST SPEEDS IN THE COLD-DRY SEASON; THERE WERE NO SEASONAL EFFECTS ON OTHER ESTIMATES. EACH INDIVIDUAL'S SUCCESSIVE SEASONAL HOME RANGES WERE HIGHLY OVERLAPPED (0.95 +/- 0.01). THE MOUNTAIN LIONS DID NOT EXPAND, CONTRACT, OR SHIFT THEIR HOME RANGES SEASONALLY, WHICH MAY BE DUE TO AMPLE PREY-AVAILABILITY AND LIMITED SEASONAL-SHIFTS IN PREY DISTRIBUTION. MOUNTAIN LIONS USED AREAS LARGER THAN MOST LOCAL RANCHES AND TENDED TO MOVE ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE QUICKLY.
