FOR NOCTURNAL OR CRYPTIC SPECIES, QUANTIFYING HABITAT USE ACROSS INDIVIDUALLY MARKED ANIMALS CAN ALLOW UNBIASED ASSESSMENT OF INTERVENTION EFFICACY AND IDENTIFY OTHER IMPORTANT HABITATS. HERE, USING A LANDSCAPE-SCALE EXPERIMENT, WE EXAMINE WHETHER INTERVENTIONS INTENDED TO CREATE NESTING HABITAT FOR THE LARGELY NOCTURNAL EURASIAN STONE-CURLEW BURHINUS OEDICNEMUS WITHIN SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND ALSO PROVIDE FORAGING HABITAT. GPS LOGGERS WERE FITTED TO FIVE ADULT STONE-CURLEWS DURING THE BREEDING SEASON WITHIN AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND (3850 HA, HEREAFTER `GRASSLAND'), SURROUNDED BY A MOSAIC OF ARABLE CROPLAND (TOTAL STUDY AREA 118 600 HA). THE LARGELY CLOSED-SWARD GRASSLAND WAS DIVERSIFIED BY EXPERIMENTAL GROUND-DISTURBANCE PLOTS (THE INTERVENTION) PRIOR TO THIS STUDY. WE USED THE GPS FIXES TO IDENTIFY 1881 FORAGING LOCATIONS (510 DURING NESTING AND 1371 POST-BREEDING) ACROSS THE GRASSLAND AND SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. MOST FORAGING LOCATIONS WERE CLOSE TO THE NEST-SITE DURING THE NESTING PERIOD (90\% WITHIN 1 KM) OR DAY-ROOST DURING POST-BREEDING (90\% WITHIN 5 KM), BUT BIRDS TRAVELLED UP TO 4.1 KM FROM THESE SITES DURING NESTING AND 13 KM POST-BREEDING. STONE-CURLEWS WERE TWO- (BY NIGHT) OR THREE-TIMES (BY DAY) MORE LIKELY TO SELECT DISTURBED-GRASSLAND OVER UNMODIFIED GRASSLAND FOR FORAGING DURING NESTING, AND C. 15 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DO SO POST-BREEDING. SPRING-SOWN CROPS AND PIG FIELDS OR MANURE HEAPS WERE ALSO SELECTED OVER GRASSLAND FOR NOCTURNAL FORAGING. GIVEN THAT CENTRAL PLACE FORAGING OCCURS IN THIS SPECIES, CONSERVATION EFFORTS THAT PROMOTE BREEDING ATTEMPTS THROUGH GROUND-DISTURBANCE SHOULD ENSURE SUITABLE FORAGING HABITAT IS NEAR THE NEST (<1 KM). CREATING MULTIPLE AREAS OF DISTURBED-GROUND CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF LARGE GRASSLAND BLOCKS CAN PROVIDE A NETWORK OF NESTING AND FORAGING HABITATS, WHILE ALLOWING ACCESS TO FORAGING HABITATS ON THE SURROUNDING ARABLE FARMLAND. SIMILAR INTERVENTIONS MAY BENEFIT OTHER DISTURBANCE ASSOCIATED GRASSLAND WADERS."

LINEARLY ARRANGED HABITATS SUCH AS STREAM NETWORKS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO FRAGMENTATION. AS THE LANDSCAPE BECOMES INCREASINGLY HUMAN DOMINATED, CONSERVATION VALUES OF FRAGMENTED HABITAT PATCHES CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED. IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND THE DEMOGRAPHIC MECHANISMS OF POPULATION PERSISTENCE OR EXTIRPATION IN FRAGMENTED PATCHES. WE STUDIED DYNAMICS OF SPATIALLY STRUCTURED POPULATIONS OF TWO JAPANESE LANDLOCKED SALMONIDS PERSISTING FOR >30 YEARS IN A HEADWATER STREAM NETWORK THAT IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED DUE TO LOW-HEAD DAMS IN THE MAINSTEM. WE PARAMETERISED AND ANALYSED SPATIAL MATRIX POPULATION MODELS USING 9-YEAR MARK-RECAPTURE DATA. TRIBUTARIES SUPPORTED HIGHER SURVIVAL RATES IN SOME LIFE STAGES, AND MOVEMENT WAS ASYMMETRICAL FROM THE TRIBUTARIES TO THE MAINSTEM. ACCORDINGLY, POPULATION GROWTH RATES WERE HIGHER IN THE TRIBUTARY PATCHES THAN THE MAINSTEM IN BOTH SPECIES DESPITE THE TRIBUTARIES OCCUPYING ONLY 12\% OR 18\% OF THE STUDY STREAM NETWORK BY SURFACE AREA. THE TRIBUTARIES HARBOURED MORE PHYSICALLY AND HYDRAULICALLY COMPLEX INSTREAM HABITATS (I.E. HIGHER WOOD DENSITY AND FLOW REFUGIA), INDICATING THAT HABITAT PATCH QUALITY WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HABITAT PATCH SIZE IN DETERMINING THE DYNAMICS OF THESE SPATIALLY STRUCTURED POPULATIONS. TRIBUTARY LOCATIONS IN THE STREAM NETWORK WERE IMPORTANT IN THE TRAJECTORY OF THESE POPULATIONS. THE UPSTREAM-DWELLING CHARR PERSISTED IN THE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED MAINSTEM PATCH (I.E. SIX IMPASSABLE INFRASTRUCTURES IN A <500 M PATCH) DUE TO IMMIGRATION OF FISH FROM UPSTREAM INCLUDING THE TRIBUTARY. HOWEVER, THE DOWNSTREAM-DWELLING SALMON HAS BEEN GRADUALLY EXTIRPATED FROM THE UPPERMOST SECTION OF THE FRAGMENTED MAINSTEM PATCH BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT MAINTAIN A POSITIVE POPULATION GROWTH RATE AFTER LOSS OF EMIGRANTS WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AND IMMIGRATION WAS PREVENTED DUE TO FRAGMENTATION. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. WE CONCLUDE THAT SMALL TRIBUTARIES HAVE RESCUED THE SPATIALLY STRUCTURED POPULATIONS FROM EXTIRPATION (CHARR) OR AT LEAST SLOWED DOWN EXTIRPATION (SALMON). LEGAL PROTECTION OF HEADWATERS AS AQUATIC HABITATS IS WEAK GLOBALLY. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT STREAM MANAGEMENT PLANS UNDERESTIMATING THE DEMOGRAPHIC VALUE OF SMALL TRIBUTARIES WILL LIKELY FAIL TO CONSERVE POPULATIONS OF HEADWATER INHABITANTS AND THEREFORE ENDANGER AQUATIC BIODIVERSITY. WE DISCUSS CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS OF THIS STUDY RELATED TO HABITAT CONNECTIVITY AND FISHERIES MANAGEMENT."

WE ALSO FOUND THAT FOR FOUR TRAITS, TETRAPLOIDS AND OCTOPLOIDS HAD DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MONOPLOID GENOME SIZE. WHILE FOR TETRAPLOIDS STEM HEIGHT AND LEAF WATER CONTENT SHOWED A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH MONOPLOID GENOME SIZE, OCTOPLOIDS HAD A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH MONOPLOID GENOME SIZE FOR STEM HEIGHT AND NO RELATIONSHIP FOR LEAF WATER CONTENT. AS GENOME SIZE WITHIN OCTOPLOIDS INCREASED, THE NUMBER OF APHIDS COLONIZING LEAVES DECREASED, WHEREAS FOR TETRAPLOIDS THERE WAS A QUADRATIC, THOUGH NON-SIGNIFICANT, RELATIONSHIP. GENERALLY WE FOUND THAT TETRAPLOIDS WERE TALLER, CHEMICALLY BETTER DEFENDED, HAD A GREATER NUMBER OF STEMS, HIGHER LEAF WATER CONTENT, AND SUPPORTED MORE APHIDS THAN OCTOPLOIDS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST TRADE-OFFS AMONG PLANT TRAITS MEDIATED BY GENOME SIZE AND PLOIDY WITH RESPECT TO FITNESS AND DEFENSE. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE LATITUDE OF PLANT ORIGIN IS A SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT OF TRAIT EXPRESSION SUGGESTING LOCAL ADAPTATION.

ONE OF THE BEST STUDIED TAXONOMIC GROUPS IN DECLINE IS THE BUTTERFLIES. HERE, WE REVIEW EVIDENCE FOR SUCH DECLINES USING FIVE SYSTEMATIC STUDIES FROM SOUTHERN SWEDEN THAT COMPARE OLD BUTTERFLY SURVEYS WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION. ADDITIONALLY, WE PROVIDE DATA ON BUTTERFLY AND BURNET MOTH EXTINCTIONS IN THE REGION'S COUNTIES. IN SOME LOCAL AREAS, HALF OF THE BUTTERFLY FAUNA HAS BEEN LOST DURING THE LAST 60-100 YEARS. IN TERMS OF EXTINCTIONS, COUNTIES HAVE LOST 2-10 BUTTERFLY AND BURNET MOTH SPECIES. LAND USE HAS CHANGED MARKEDLY WITH KEY BUTTERFLY HABITATS SUCH AS HAY MEADOWS DISAPPEARING AT ALARMING RATES. GRAZED, MIXED OPEN WOODLANDS HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO DENSE CONIFEROUS FORESTS AND CLEAR-CUTS, AND DOMESTIC GRAZERS HAVE BEEN RELOCATED FROM WOODLANDS TO ARABLE FIELDS AND SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS. LEY HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY AND IS USED FOR BALE SILAGE REPEATEDLY DURING THE SEASON. OVERALL, THE CHANGED AND INTENSIFIED LAND USE HAS MARKEDLY REDUCED THE AVAILABILITY OF NECTAR RESOURCES IN THE LANDSCAPE. SPECIES THAT DECLINE IN SWEDEN ARE STRONGLY DECREASING OR ALREADY EXTINCT IN OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE. MANY TYPICAL GRASSLAND SPECIES THAT WERE NUMEROUS IN FORMER TIMES HAVE DECLINED SEVERELY; AMONG THOSE HESPERIA COMMA, LYCAENA VIRGAUREAE, LYCAENA HIPPOTHOE, ARGYNNIS ADIPPE, AND POLYOMMATUS SEMIARGUS. ALSO, SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH OPEN WOODLANDS AND WETLANDS SUCH AS, COLIAS PALAENO, BOLORIA EUPHROSYNE AND THE GLADE-INHABITING LEPTIDEA SINAPIS HAVE ALL DECREASED MARKEDLY. CURRENT MANAGEMENT PRACTISE AND EU COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY RULES FAVOUR INTENSIVE GRAZING ON THE REMAINING SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS, WITH STRONG NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON BUTTERFLY DIVERSITY. ABANDONED GRASSLANDS ARE VERY COMMON IN LESS PRODUCTIVE AREAS OF SOUTHERN SWEDEN AND THESE HABITATS MAY SOON BECOME FORESTS. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION TO PRESERVE UNFERTILIZED, MOWN AND LIGHTLY GRAZED GRASSLANDS. IT IS ALSO CRUCIAL TO ENCOURAGE THAT MANAGEMENT OF ABANDONED GRASSLANDS RESUMES BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. IN ORDER TO MITIGATE RISKS OF FURTHER SPECIES LOSS AND TO WORK TOWARDS RECOVERY OF THREATENED BUTTERFLY POPULATIONS USING BEST KNOWN PRACTISES, WE RECOMMEND TWELVE TYPES OF MANAGEMENT MEASURES FAVOURABLE FOR MANY BUTTERFLIES."

PROPORTIONALLY, MORE THREATENED SPECIES WERE PROTECTED IN SITU AND EX SITU THAN NON-THREATENED SPECIES. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE CHINESE REDLIST ASSESSMENT ASSIGNED OVER HARVESTING AS A THREAT FACTOR TO 15 CHINESE ORCHIDS ONLY (2.3\%), A GROSS UNDERESTIMATION OF THIS THREAT CONSIDERING BOTH THE CHINESE AND INTERNATIONAL ORCHID MARKETS. WE PROPOSE ESTABLISHING SMALL NATURE RESERVES TO PROTECT WILD ORCHID SPECIES THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY OCCUR IN ANY PROTECTED AREA, CREATING EX SITU COLLECTION NETWORKS TO STRENGTHEN CONSERVATION CAPACITY (INCLUDING INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE CONCERNED WITH UTILIZATION ONLY), AND ESTABLISHING A DYNAMIC LIST OF WILD ORCHIDS IN TRADE, ALONG WITH TRADE VOLUMES, TO BETTER-GAUGE CONSERVATION THREATS POSED BY WILD HARVEST."

LOCATION: CHANGJIANG RIVER ESTUARY AND ITS ADJACENT WATERS. METHODS: SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED IN THREE SEASONS OF 2019. MORPHOLOGICALLY IDENTIFIED SPECIES WERE ASSIGNED FUNCTIONAL TRAITS INCLUDING BODY LENGTH, FEEDING STRATEGY, TROPHIC GROUP, REPRODUCTION MODE AND HABITAT TYPE, AND CLUSTERED INTO FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY INDICES WERE CALCULATED. THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES IN EXPLAINING THE SEASONALITY OF FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURES WAS ASSESSED. RESULTS: TEN FUNCTIONAL GROUPS WERE IDENTIFIED, AND FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE SHOWED STRONG SEASONAL DYNAMICS. CURRENT- AND MIXED-FEEDING OMNIVORE-HERBIVORES WERE THE PREDOMINANT GROUP OVER SEASONS. THE CONTRIBUTION OF CARNIVOROUS, DETRITIVOROUS AND OMNIVOROUS GROUPS INCREASED FROM WINTER-SPRING TO AUTUMN. THE SEASONALITY OF ZOOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE WAS MAINLY EXPLAINED BY THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE, FLUVIAL DISCHARGE AND WARM CURRENT. LOW TEMPERATURE AND RIVERINE INPUT OF NUTRIENT IN WINTER-SPRING FAVOURED THE SMALL-SIZED HERBIVORES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE RISING TEMPERATURE AND RUN-OFF IN SUMMER SHIFTED THE ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY TO LARGER HERBIVORES AND CARNIVORES. MODERATE TEMPERATURE AND RELATIVELY ENHANCED EFFECT OF WARM CURRENT PROMOTED THE PROLIFERATION OF CARNIVORES AND DETRITIVORES IN AUTUMN. FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY ALSO VARIED OVER SEASONS. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: THE FUNCTIONAL DYNAMICS OF MESOZOOPLANKTON IN CRE ACROSS ESTUARINE GRADIENT AND SEASONALITY IS SHAPED BY THE SEASONAL VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE, FLUVIAL PULSE AND WARM CURRENT INTRUSION.

THE UBIQUITOUS USE OF CONCRETE IN TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO ALTERATIONS IN FRESHWATER AND COASTAL MARINE SYSTEMS. YET, IN SOME CASES, THERE ARE NO APPROPRIATE ALTERNATIVE BUILDING MATERIALS SUCH THAT CONCRETE ITSELF IS CONFOUNDED BY ITS APPLICATION. FOR EXAMPLE, AS THE FOUNDATION FOR MOST DAMS, CONCRETE FRAGMENTS RIVERS AND CHANNELIZES STREAMS, OFTEN CREATING UNNATURAL SYSTEMS, YET DAMS ARE NECESSARY FOR HYDROPOWER GENERATION AND FLOOD CONTROL WITH FEW ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS FOR CONSTRUCTION. IN RIPARIAN AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS, CONCRETE HARBOURS AND INLAND CANAL SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN USED TO ADDRESS EROSION OR RECLAIM AREAS FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. EVEN WHEN REMOVED (E.G., DAM REMOVAL, NATURALIZATION OF SHORELINES), CONCRETE DUST IS A MAJOR AQUATIC POLLUTANT. INSTANCES DO EXIST, HOWEVER, WHERE CONCRETE HAS BEEN USED TO BENEFIT AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS - SUCH AS THE INSTALLATION OF FISH PASSAGE FACILITIES AT BARRIERS OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FISH-FRIENDLY CULVERTS - THOUGH EVEN THEN, THERE IS A MOVEMENT TOWARDS NATURE-LIKE FISHWAYS THAT AVOID THE USE OF HARMFUL MATERIALS LIKE CONCRETE. THERE ARE ALSO OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE CONSERVATION GAINS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEAWALLS THAT INCLUDE MORE NATURAL AND COMPLEX FEATURES TO BENEFIT BIOTA AND ALLOW FOR ESSENTIAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES TO OCCUR IN AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL INNOVATIONS IN RECENT YEARS THAT INCREASE THE PERMEABILITY OF CONCRETE, HOWEVER THESE HAVE LIMITED APPLICATION IN AN AQUATIC CONTEXT (E.G., NOT RELEVANT TO DAM CONSTRUCTION OR EROSION CONTROL BUT MAY BE RELEVANT IN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS). WE PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORY OF CONCRETE, DISCUSS SOME OF THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF CONCRETE ON AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS, AND ENCOURAGE PLANNERS, ENGINEERS, DEVELOPERS, AND REGULATORS TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES TO CONCRETE WHICH BENEFIT AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS AND THE SERVICES THEY OFFER.

A COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE OF P-CRIT VALUES, COMPRISING 331 MEASUREMENTS FROM 96 PUBLISHED STUDIES, COVERING 151 FISH SPECIES FROM 58 FAMILIES, PROVIDES THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND UP-TO-DATE ANALYSIS OF HYPOXIA TOLERANCE IN TELEOSTS. METHODOLOGIES FOR DETERMINING PCRIT ARE CRITICALLY EXAMINED TO EVALUATE ITS USEFULNESS AS AN INDICATOR OF HYPOXIA TOLERANCE IN FISHES. VARIOUS ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC FACTORS THAT INTERACT WITH HYPOXIA ARE ANALYSED FOR THEIR EFFECT ON P, INCLUDING TEMPERATURE, CO,, ACIDIFICATION, TOXIC METALS AND FEEDING. SALINITY, TEMPERATURE, BODY MASS AND ROUTINE METABOLIC RATE WERE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH P-CRIT; 20\% OF VARIATION IN THE P-CRIT, DATA SET WAS EXPLAINED BY THESE FOUR VARIABLES. AN IMPORTANT METHODOLOGICAL ISSUE NOT PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED IS THE INCONSISTENT INCREASE IN PARTIAL PRESSURE OF CO, WITHIN A CLOSED RESPIROMETER DURING THE MEASUREMENT OF P-CRIT. MODELLING SUGGESTS THAT THE FINAL PARTIAL PRESSURE OF CO, REACHED CAN VARY FROM 650 TO 3500 MU ATM DEPENDING ON THE AMBIENT PH AND SALINITY, WITH POTENTIALLY MAJOR EFFECTS ON BLOOD ACID-BASE BALANCE AND P IT ITSELF. THIS DATABASE WILL FORM PART OF A WIDELY ACCESSIBLE REPOSITORY OF PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAIT DATA THAT WILL SERVE AS A RESOURCE TO FACILITATE FUTURE STUDIES OF FISH ECOLOGY, CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT."

GIVEN THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE OBSERVED GENETIC PARTITION AND THE DIFFERENTIAL GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF GREEK AND PHOENICIAN SETTLEMENTS AND INFLUENCE DURING THE LAST MILLENNIUM BC IN THOSE ISLANDS, WE PROPOSE THAT WEASELS MAY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE FIRST GROUP OF ISLANDS BY THE GREEKS AND INTO THE SECOND GROUP BY THE PHOENICIANS. THERE IS STRONG SUPPORT THAT THE COMMERCIAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC EXPANSIONS OF PHOENICIANS AND GREEKS ALLOWED THE COLONIZATION OF THE WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN ISLANDS BY THE HOUSE MOUSE, AND TEXTS FROM CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY SHOW EVIDENCE THAT WEASELS WERE USED FOR RODENT CONTROL.

USING THE EXAMPLE OF (RE)INTRODUCED WILD BOAR (SUS SCROFA) IN ENGLAND AS `FERAL REWILDING' IN ACTION, THIS PAPER CONSIDERS HOW THE POLITICS AROUND THEIR PRESENCE ARE CONTESTED BY ACTORS WHO HOLD DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF WILD BOAR AND HUMAN-NONHUMAN RELATIONS MORE BROADLY. AFTER A MULTI-CENTURY ABSENCE, OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES FARMED WILD BOAR HAVE ESCAPED AND BEEN DELIBERATELY RELEASED, OCCASIONALLY ESTABLISHING AUTONOMOUS AND SELF-SUSTAINING POPULATIONS. THIS IS MOST VISIBLE IN THE FOREST OF DEAN WHERE THEIR UNFAMILIAR PRESENCE HAS INCREASINGLY RECONFIGURED SOCIAL RELATIONS. BEING CATEGORISED AS `FERAL' AS A STRATEGY OF GOVERNANCE IS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO A FRAUGHT POLITICAL LANDSCAPE WHERE WILD BOAR BELONGING IS CONSTANTLY QUESTIONED."

SEA TURTLES DEMONSTRATE THIS LIFE HISTORY TRAIT, WHICH CAN MAKE THESE SPECIES HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO POPULATION DECLINES IF NESTING HABITATS ARE LOST OR DEGRADED. CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT THUS REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE AND WHEN TURTLES NEST AND CHANGES IN ABUNDANCE IN THESE HABITATS THROUGH TIME. HERE, WE COMPILED NEW AND PUBLISHED DATA AND USED A NOVEL ANALYSIS TO DESCRIBE SEASONALITY, ANNUAL ABUNDANCE AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF NESTING GREEN (CHELONIA MYDAS) AND HAWKSBILL (ERETMOCHELYS IMBRICATA) TURTLES IN DATA-DEFICIENT POPULATIONS THAT INHABIT THE RED SEA. MAJOR NEW ROOKERIES WERE IDENTIFIED FOR GREEN TURTLES AT JAZIRAT(1) MASHABAH (113 AND 179 NESTING FEMALES IN 2018 AND 2019) AND FOR HAWKSBILL TURTLES AT JAZIRAT AL WAQQADI (79 NESTING FEMALES IN 2018), BOTH OF WHICH ARE LOCATED ON NEARSHORE ISLANDS OF THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA IN AN AREA SUBJECT TO INDUSTRIAL, RESIDENTIAL AND ECOTOURISM DEVELOPMENTS. AN UPWARD TREND IN ANNUAL ABUNDANCE OF NESTING SEA TURTLES WAS ESTIMATED AT SOME SITES INCLUDING RAS AL BARIDI (SAUDI ARABIA), A MAJOR ROOKERY OF GREEN TURTLES IN THE RED SEA, WHERE THE ANNUAL NUMBERS INCREASED FROM 14-110 INDIVIDUALS IN 1982-1995 TO 178 AND 330 INDIVIDUALS IN 2018 AND 2019. THIS INTEGRATIVE WORK PROVIDES THE MOST UP-TO-DATE, COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ON NESTING SEA TURTLES IN THE RED SEA AND DOCUMENTS A CRITICAL BASELINE FOR SEA TURTLE CONSERVATION AND FUTURE MANAGEMENT EFFORT."

NEOTROPICAL ORGANISMS HAVE EVOLVED IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF RELATIVELY LOW TEMPORAL VARIATION IN FOOD AVAILABILITY, BUT WHEN NEOTROPICAL FORESTS ARE CONVERTED TO AGRICULTURE, THE TEMPORAL PATCHINESS OF FOOD RESOURCES IS INCREASED. PLANT SPECIES WITH A CONTINUOUS (I.E. STEADY-STATE) FLOWERING/FRUITING PHENOLOGY ARE UNIQUE TO THE TROPICS AND MAY MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTE FOOD RESOURCES TEMPORALLY IN AGROECOSYSTEMS. 2. HERE, WE TEST THE EFFECTS OF AN EXPERIMENTALLY PLANTED SUPPLEMENTAL STEADY-STATE FLORAL RESOURCE, HAMELIA PATENS JACQ., ON BEE DIVERSITY AND POLLINATION SERVICES IN COFFEE AGROFORESTS. IN ADDITION, WE EVALUATE EFFECTS OF THE STEADY-STATE RESOURCE DURING LOW-DENSITY AND MASS COFFEE BLOOMS. 3. MALAISE TRAP DATA INDICATED THAT BEE SPECIES DENSITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN COFFEE AGROFORESTS WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL STEADY-STATE FLORAL RESOURCES [11.89 +/- 1.62 (SE)] COMPARED TO THOSE WITHOUT (8.88 +/- 1.10). 4. THE STEADY-STATE FLORAL RESOURCE HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON NATIVE BEE VISITS TO COFFEE FLOWERS AND A POSITIVE IMPACT ON APIS MELLIFERA VISITS TO COFFEE FLOWERS (E.G. DURING LOW-DENSITY BLOOMS AGROFORESTS WITH STEADY-STATE RESOURCES HAD 76\% FEWER NATIVE BEE AND 130\% MORE A. MELLIFERA VISITS TO COFFEE FLOWERS). ALTHOUGH COFFEE INITIAL FRUIT SET RATES WERE HIGHER ACROSS ALL AGROFORESTS DURING LOW-DENSITY BLOOMS (0.74 +/- 0.03) COMPARED TO THE MASS BLOOM (0.59 +/- 0.03), STEADY-STATE FLORAL RESOURCES DID NOT AFFECT INITIAL FRUIT SET RATES (Z = -1.05, P = 0.29). 5. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PLANTS WITH A STEADY-STATE PHENOLOGY CAN PROVIDE MORE RELIABLE RESOURCES FOR BEES, SUPPORTING THE CONSERVATION OF WILD BEES IN AGROFORESTS. HOWEVER, STEADY-STATE FLOWERING MAY DRAW NATIVE BEES AWAY FROM THE FOCAL CROP, ESPECIALLY DURING LOW-DENSITY FLOWERING."

WE ASSESSED THE INFLUENCE OF HABITAT CONNECTIVITY, HABITAT QUALITY AND INVASIVE SPECIES FOR DISTRIBUTIONS AND LOCAL ABUNDANCE OF EGGS AND LARVAE OF CRUCIAN CARP (CRASSIUS AURATUS COMPLEX, WHICH IS LISTED AS ``DATA DEFICIENT'' ON THE JAPANESE RED LIST) IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES SURROUNDING LAKE MIKATA, JAPAN, WHERE DRAINAGE DITCHES AND PADDY FIELDS ARE EXTENSIVELY UTILISED FOR SPAWNING (LAKE OR RIVER SHORES ARE ALSO USED). WE INVESTIGATED THE PRESENCE AND ABUNDANCE OF EGGS AND LARVAE OF CRUCIAN CARP AND HABITAT COMPONENTS AT 146 SITES ACROSS A RANGE OF PRESUMED SPAWNING HABITATS. EGG PRESENCE WAS AFFECTED STRONGLY BY CONNECTIVITY TO THE LAKE (WATERCOURSE DISTANCE FROM THE LAKE), AND EGG ABUNDANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY BOTH CONNECTIVITY AND HABITAT QUALITY. IN CONTRAST, LARVAL PRESENCE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HABITAT QUALITY. LARVAL ABUNDANCE WAS INFLUENCED BY CONNECTIVITY AND HABITAT QUALITY, BUT THE EFFECT OF CONNECTIVITY WAS RELATIVELY LOW. FURTHERMORE, LARVAL ABUNDANCE WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE PRESENCE OF THE INVASIVE SPECIES RED SWAMP CRAYFISH (PROCAMBARUS CRAKI) AND BULLFROG (RANA CATESBEIANA). OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CONNECTIVITY, HABITAT QUALITY AND THE PRESENCES OF INVASIVE SPECIES ARE CRUCIAL IN DETERMINING SUITABLE SPAWNING AND NURSERY HABITATS, BUT THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE MAY VARY DEPENDING ON EGG AND LARVAL LIFE STAGES. WE SUGGEST THAT RESTORING CONNECTIVITY, IMPROVING HABITAT QUALITY AND REMOVAL OF INVASIVE SPECIES COULD BE EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION STRATEGIES FOR THE DECLINING POPULATIONS OF CRUCIAN CARP IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES.
