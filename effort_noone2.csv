EARLIER STUDIES SUGGESTED THAT THIS POPULATION SUFFERED A DECLINE OF 75\% DURING 1978-1994. TO EVALUATE ITS CURRENT STATUS WE CONDUCTED A LINE TRANSECT SURVEY IN THE RESERVE AND ASSESSED EFFECTS OF ECOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC VARIABLES ON MACAQUE ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION. WE ESTIMATED A DENSITY OF 44.9 INDIVIDUALS KM(-2) (95\% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, CI, 25.6-78.8) AND A TOTAL POPULATION OF 1,951 INDIVIDUALS (CI 1,113-3,421). THIS ESTIMATE OF DENSITY IS 35\% LOWER THAN THAT OF 68.7 INDIVIDUALS KM(-2) IN 1994. THERE WERE MODERATE TO STRONG CORRELATIONS BETWEEN MACAQUE ABUNDANCE AND VEGETATION STRUCTURE (BASAL AREA AND CANOPY TREE DENSITY). WE OBSERVED ILLEGAL LOGGING IN THE AREA AND THEREFORE HABITAT QUALITY FOR MACAQUES MAY BE INDIRECTLY AFFECTED BY ILLEGAL HUMAN ACTIVITIES. IF OUR POPULATION ESTIMATE IS PROJECTED LINEARLY M. NIGRA COULD BECOME EXTINCT IN TANGKOKO WITHIN 46 YEARS, HIGHLIGHTING THE URGENT NEED TO IMPROVE MANAGEMENT OF ILLEGAL HUNTING AND LOGGING IN THE RESERVE."

HOWEVER, THIS ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY COMES WITH A MYRIAD OF COMPLICATIONS. VOLUNTEERS VARY IN THEIR FAMILIARITY WITH WILDLIFE, THUS, THE ACCURACY OF USER-DERIVED CLASSIFICATIONS MAY BE BIASED BY THE COMMONNESS OR POPULARITY OF SPECIES AND USER-EXPERIENCE. FROM AN EXTENSIVE MULTI-SITE CAMERA TRAP STUDY ACROSS MICHIGAN, U.S.A, WE COMPILED AND CLASSIFIED IMAGES THROUGH A PUBLIC SCIENCE PLATFORM CALLED MICHIGAN ZOOMIN. WE AGGREGATED RESPONSES FROM 15 INDEPENDENT USERS PER IMAGE USING MULTIPLE CONSENSUS METHODS TO ASSESS ACCURACY BY COMPARING TO SPECIES IDENTIFICATION COMPLETED BY WILDLIFE EXPERTS. WE ALSO EVALUATED HOW DIFFERENT FACTORS INCLUDING CONSENSUS ALGORITHMS, STUDY AREA, WILDLIFE SPECIES, USER SUPPORT, AND CAMERA TYPE INFLUENCED THE ACCURACY OF USER-DERIVED CLASSIFICATIONS. OVERALL ACCURACY OF USER-DERIVED CLASSIFICATION WAS 97\%; ALTHOUGH, SEVERAL CANID (E.G., CANIS LUPUS, VULPES VULPES) AND MUSTELID (E.G., NEOVISON VISON) SPECIES WERE REPEATEDLY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY BY USERS AND HAD LOWER ACCURACY. WHEN VALIDATING USER-DERIVED CLASSIFICATION, WE FOUND THAT STUDY AREA, CONSENSUS METHOD, AND USER SUPPORT BEST EXPLAINED ACCURACY. TO OVERCOME HESITANCY ASSOCIATED WITH DATA COLLECTED BY UNTRAINED PARTICIPANTS, WE DEMONSTRATED THEIR VALUE BY SHOWING THAT THE ACCURACY FROM VOLUNTEERS WAS COMPARABLE TO EXPERTS WHEN CLASSIFYING NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS. OUR HIERARCHICAL WORKFLOW THAT INTEGRATED MULTIPLE CONSENSUS METHODS LED TO MORE IMAGE CLASSIFICATIONS WITHOUT EXTENSIVE TRAINING AND EVEN WHEN THE EXPERTISE OF THE VOLUNTEER WAS UNKNOWN.

TRANSLOCATIONS HAVE HAD LIMITED SUCCESS IN RESTORING VIABLE POPULATIONS OF SAGE-GROUSE; A LACK OF SUCCESS IS ATTRIBUTED TO LONG-DISTANCE POST-RELEASE MOVEMENTS AWAY FROM RELEASE SITES, REDUCED SURVIVAL, AND LACK OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF TRANSLOCATED INDIVIDUALS. TRANSLOCATING FEMALE SAGE-GROUSE WITH THEIR CHICKS (BROOD TRANSLOCATION) IS A TECHNIQUE AIMED AT PROMOTING BREEDING AREA FIDELITY AND REPRODUCTION AND MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO POPULATION RESTORATION EFFORTS. FURTHERMORE, THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE, RELOCATE, AND RELEASE INDIVIDUALS WHILE MINIMIZING TRANSLOCATION-INDUCED LOSS INCREASES THE OVERALL PROBABILITY OF RESTORATION SUCCESS. ACCORDINGLY, WE DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL TO TRANSLOCATE FEMALE SAGE-GROUSE AND THEIR BROODS SIMULTANEOUSLY, USING A DELAYED-RELEASE SYSTEM THAT INCLUDED A CUSTOM RELEASE BOX AND ACCLIMATION PEN.

A FEW STUDIES EXPLORING POPULATION-LEVEL PATTERNS OF GENETIC CONNECTIVITY AT THE LOCAL SCALE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME AREAS POSSESSING LIMITED GENE FLOW LIKELY DUE TO RECENT ANTHROPOGENIC LANDSCAPE CHANGES.

ALTHOUGH THE ABOVE ARE BOTH SUPPORTED BY EMPIRICAL DATA, WE HIGHLIGHT ANOTHER POSSIBILITY THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED YET RARELY INVESTIGATED. MILLIONS OF WILD BOBWHITES HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED AMONG POPULATIONS, AND MILLIONS MORE CAPTIVE-REARED BOBWHITES HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE RELEASED ACROSS THE SPECIES' RANGE. GIVEN THE MASSIVE SCALE AT WHICH BOBWHITES HAVE BEEN ARTIFICIALLY DISPERSED, MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF INTROGRESSION OF NONLOCAL BIRDS ON OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND RECENT CHANGES IN BOBWHITE POPULATION FRAGMENTATION, SIZE, AND DIVERSITY.

TROPICAL MONTANE FORESTS ARE AMONG THE MOST BIODIVERSE PLACES IN THE WORLD, YET HIGH RATES OF ENDEMISM AND NARROW PHYSIOLOGICAL TOLERANCES PLACE TROPICAL MONTANE SPECIES AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE TO ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS. THEREFORE, IT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO UNDERSTAND HOW ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES ARE STRUCTURED ALONG ELEVATIONAL AND SPATIAL GRADIENTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE AFROTROPICS, WHICH ARE HISTORICALLY UNDERSTUDIED DESPITE THEIR UNIQUE CLIMATE AND RICH BIODIVERSITY. HERE WE EXAMINE HOW THE AFROTROPICAL MONTANE BIRD COMMUNITY OF NYUNGWE NATIONAL PARK IN RWANDA IS SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY STRUCTURED WITH RESPECT TO ELEVA-TION AND GEOGRAPHY. WE SHOW THAT DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF GEOGRAPHIC BARRIERS, AVIAN COMMUNITIES ARE SPATIALLY STRUCTURED ACROSS THE ELEVATIONAL GRADIENT WITH SIGNIFICANT REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN BOTH SPECIES COMPOSITION AND RICHNESS, AND THAT HIGH ELEVATION ASSEMBLAGES ARE COMPRISED OF FEWER SPECIES COMPARED TO LOWER AND MIDDLE ELEVATIONS. WE FIND EVIDENCE FOR OVERALL STABILITY IN SPECIES RICHNESS DURING THIS STUDY PERIOD (2001-2011) YET DIFFERING SEASON-SPECIFIC TRENDS ACROSS THE ELEVATIONAL RANGE OF THE STUDY. SPECIFICALLY, THE HIGH ELEVATION ASSEMBLAGE EXHIBITED A WET SEASON-SPECIFIC INCREASE IN RICHNESS, CONGRUENT WITH PREDICTED UPSLOPE ELEVATIONAL SHIFTS FOR LOW AND MIDDLE ELEVATION SPECIES. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ANTHROPOGENIC FACTORS MAY HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON RICHNESS PATTERNS DEPENDING ON ELEVATION AND REGION, AND THAT PROTECTED AREAS LARGE ENOUGH TO ENCOMPASS THE FULL RANGE OF GEOGRAPHIC AND ELEVATION GRADIENTS ARE REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY CONSERVE AFROMONTANE BIRD COMMUNITIES."

FENCING MATERIAL HAD A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF A RATSNAKE SUCCESSFULLY CLIMBING OVER THE FENCING. FURTHER, WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN FENCING HEIGHT AND SHAPE ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF A RATSNAKE SUCCESSFULLY CLIMBING OVER THE FENCING. LONGER SNAKES WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL AT CLIMBING OVER FENCING THAN SHORTER ONES. THE MOST EFFECTIVE FENCING TESTED WAS 100 CM METAL MESH FENCING WITH A LIP, WHICH PREVENTED SUCCESSFUL ESCAPES IN 93.3\% OF TRIALS.

THESE INCLUDE: THICK CANINES, WELL-DEVELOPED HEAD MUSCLES AND A FATAL BITE DIRECTED TO BRAINCASE OR NAPE.

THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OTOLITH ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION AND WATER TEMPERATURE, DESCRIBED BY DELTA O-18(OTOLITH(VPBD)) - DELTA O-18(WATER(VPBD)) = 32.03 - 0.21(DEGREES C). RESULTS INDICATE THAT OTOLITH ISOTOPE TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY THE AVERAGE RELATIVE TEMPERATURE OCCUPIED BY SILVER SHINER, REPRESENTING THE FIRST INVESTIGATION OF OXYGEN ISOTOPES TO UNDERSTAND THERMAL OCCUPANCY OF THE SPECIES. THIS FIELD-BASED EQUATION PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND HOW SILVER SHINER MAY RESPOND TO ALTERATIONS IN STREAM TEMPERATURES RESULTING FROM URBANIZATION AND CLIMATE EFFECTS AND MAY BE USEFUL IN IDENTIFYING THERMAL REFUGIA FOR THE SPECIES. FIELD-BASED, SPECIES-SPECIFIC FRACTIONATION EQUATIONS CAN PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO THE THERMAL ECOLOGY OF MANY SMALL-BODIED FISHES, WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY IMPERILLED DUE TO THERMAL STRESSORS."

CALLERYANA WAS PREVALENT WHERE THERE WAS LOWER GROUND COVER BY GRASSES AND FORBS AND WHERE THERE WAS LIMITED ORGANIC MATTER BUT INCREASED SOIL PHOSPHORUS, NITRATE AND MICRONUTRIENTS. THIS STUDY COULD NOT DETERMINE IF P. CALLERYANA CAUSED THESE CHANGES OR IF IT ESTABLISHED BECAUSE THESE PARAMETERS WERE FAVORABLE. OUR DATA ALSO INDICATED AN INTRIGUING RELATIONSHIP OF INCREASED SPECIES RICHNESS IN P. CALLERYANA INVADED SITES, POTENTIALLY BECAUSE UNINVADED SITES WERE CHARACTERIZED BY DOMINANT GRASSES THAT MAY REDUCE AVAILABLE NICHE SPACE. TAKEN TOGETHER, THIS WORK SUGGESTS THAT P. CALLERYANA ESTABLISHMENT DEPENDS ON THE RELATIVE PROPAGULE PRESSURE AND NICHE AVAILABILITY AND INDICATES POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPING A PREDICTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR LANDSCAPE INVASION."

GENOTYPIC DATA FROM SEVEN MICROSATELLITE LOCI WERE ANALYZED FOR 276 INDIVIDUALS FROM 15 LOCALITIES REPRESENTING MAJOR DRAINAGES WITHIN THE REGION IN NORTHEAST IOWA.

RESULTS OF THE GENETIC ANALYSES REVEALED TWO DISTINCT, BUT SOMEWHAT ADMIXED GENETIC CLUSTERS OF LONGNOSE DACE IN IOWA. THE GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN LOCALITIES AND BETWEEN DRAINAGES WAS LOW TO MODERATE WITH SOME EVIDENCE OF ISOLATION BY DISTANCE. MOST OF THE VARIATION WAS OBSERVED BY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITHIN LOCAL POPULATIONS. THE ENM GENERATED LARGELY REFLECTED THE KNOWN DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES IN IOWA WITH A DECREASING PROBABILITY OF SUITABLE HABITAT FROM NORTHERN TO SOUTHERN DRAINAGES. GEOLOGIC FACTORS PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE MODEL.

ADAPTING TO SUCH IMPACTS WILL REQUIRE THE INTEGRATION OF SCIENTIFIC AND LOCAL (FOLK) KNOWLEDGE, ESPECIALLY THE FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCES AND PERCEPTIONS OF RESOURCE USERS SUCH AS FISHERS. IN THIS STUDY, WE IDENTIFY HOW COMMERCIAL RIVERINE FISHERS IN THE AMAZON REMEMBER EXTREME CLIMATIC EVENTS (FLOOD AND DROUGHT) AND HOW THEY FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF EXTREME EVENTS ON FISH AVAILABILITY. METHODS: DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM THE MAIN MANAUS FISHERY HARBOR BETWEEN JUNE AND OCTOBER OF 2013. SEMI-STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRES AND A HISTORICAL TIMELINE TECHNIQUE WERE USED TO GATHER DATA FROM ARTISANAL COMMERCIAL FISHERS. FISHERS' KNOWLEDGE OF EXTREME CLIMATE EVENTS WAS ASSESSED BY THEIR ``CULTURAL CONSENSUS'' FOR IDENTIFICATION OF EVENT YEARS AND PERCEIVED IMPACTS. FISHERS' RESPONSES WERE ALSO COMPARED TO HYDROLOGICAL DATA TO TEST THEIR SIMILARITY. RESULTS: THERE WAS A HIGH LEVEL OF CULTURAL CONSENSUS AMONG FISHERS ABOUT EXTREME EVENTS YEARS. THEY WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY FOUR CONSECUTIVE UNUSUAL DROUGHTS, BETWEEN 2009 AND 2012. ELEVATED LEVELS OF FISH MORTALITY AND DECREASES IN THE FISHERY WERE PERCEIVED AS CONSEQUENCES OF THE DROUGHT EVENTS, AS WELL AS, A REDUCTION IN FISH SIZE, AND DISAPPEARANCE OF SOME SPECIES. EXTREME FLOOD EVENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES ACCESSING FISHING GROUNDS. CONCLUSIONS: EXTREME CLIMATIC EVENTS (FLOODS AND DROUGHTS) WERE REMEMBERED, AND THE RECENT INCREASE IN THEIR INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY WAS ALSO PERCEIVED. MOREOVER, EXTREME CLIMATE EVENT (MAINLY DROUGHTS) IMPACTS ON FISHERY RESOURCES WERE ALSO OBSERVED.

THREE PARAMETERS WERE USED AS INDICATORS OF CONSERVATION STATUS: SHOOT DENSITY, SEED BANKS, AND AERIAL COVERAGE. AVERAGE SHOOT DENSITY IN THE CIF (741 SHOOTS M(-2)) WAS 3.8 TIMES HIGHER THAN IN BCP (194 SHOOTS M(-2)), AND AVERAGE SEED BANK DENSITY WAS SIMILAR IN BOTH WETLANDS (17,442 SEEDS M(-2) VS. 17,000 SEEDS M(-2)).

EELGRASS COVERAGE WAS THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE GREATER IN THE CIF (9725 HA) THAN IN BCP (3 HA). THE STRIKING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE WETLANDS IS THE LACK OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FOR BCP AND THE PROTECTION OF THE CIF BY THE SERI INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY, WHICH INCREASES HUMAN PRESSURE IN THE FORMER, PUTTING IT AT HIGH RISK OF DISAPPEARING.
